[38:55] time uh um sometimes while driving to
[38:58] walk in the morning
[39:00] I um you know morning drive you feel
[39:02] inspired maybe listening to some music
[39:05] or listening to a sermon and I get to
[39:07] walk and at times I'm able to carry that
[39:10] atmosphere into walk but other times you
[39:13] know the devil trows banana peels and um
[39:17] I'm like I can't carry the atmosphere
[39:20] into walk you know sometimes um I
[39:22] remember like two weeks ago or so on
[39:24] Wednesday morning I was going to walk
[39:27] and feeling inspired again I got to walk
[39:31] and God laid a song on my
[39:33] heart and um something told me we send a
[39:36] message to propul I was like oh I'll do
[39:38] it later sure enough that day was really
[39:41] really stressful at walk and at the end
[39:43] of the day I didn't feel a bit like
[39:46] singing um and I was thinking maybe
[39:49] someone needed to hear that song maybe
[39:51] someone needed the message in that
[39:53] song um last week I had another song
[39:55] laid on my heart
[39:57] and again earlier in the week I wasn't
[39:59] feeling like and but this morning I woke
[40:02] up and I was like Satan not today around
[40:06] 6:00 before 700 I sent a message to prop
[40:08] Paul let's get that done I'll sing
[40:10] Tonight by God's grace and
[40:12] um um this

[1:07:27] samel chapter
[1:07:32] 17 let us read from verse
[1:07:37] 31 and when the
[1:07:40] words were heard which David
[1:07:44] spake they rehearsed them before
[1:07:49] saw and he sent for
[1:07:52] him and David said to
[1:07:55] Saul let no man's heart fail because of
[1:08:01] him thy servant will
[1:08:03] go and fight with these
[1:08:08] Philistines and so said to David Thou
[1:08:10] Art not able to go against this
[1:08:13] Philistine to fight against him for thou
[1:08:17] B A Youth and he a man of war from his
[1:08:22] Youth and they said to
[1:08:25] so thy servant kept his father's sheep
[1:08:29] and there came a lion and a bear and
[1:08:32] took a lamp out of the
[1:08:34] flock and I went out after him and
[1:08:38] smoked him and delivered it out of his
[1:08:41] mouth and when he arose against me I
[1:08:44] caught him by his beard and Smo him and
[1:08:48] slew
[1:08:50] him that servant slew both the Lion and
[1:08:54] the
[1:08:55] bear and this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:08:59] shall be as one of them amen seeing you
[1:09:04] have defy the armies of the Living
[1:09:08] God David said
[1:09:11] moreover the Lord that delivered me out
[1:09:15] of the power of the lion and out of the
[1:09:18] power of the bear he will deliver me out
[1:09:23] of the hand of this
[1:09:25] Philistine and sa said unto David
[1:09:30] go and the Lord be with thee amen may
[1:09:35] God bless the reading of his word shall
[1:09:37] we please be
[1:09:41] seated praise the
[1:09:44] Lord I say praise the
[1:09:46] Lord yes I didn't say praise Timothy I
[1:09:49] said praise the
[1:09:51] Lord hallelujah h is worthy to be

[1:10:01] his people and we are happy to be back
[1:10:04] in the house of the Lord amen that's
[1:10:07] been a while since I think 2019 I was
[1:10:09] said the last time but well we thank God
[1:10:12] that we are still pressing on and
[1:10:16] uh the one that began that good work in
[1:10:18] us will bring it completion because God
[1:10:21] is
[1:10:22] faithful and so this
[1:10:26] evening I want us to encourage ourselves
[1:10:28] from the scripture that we have
[1:10:31] read
[1:10:34] 32 when David said to Saul let no man's
[1:10:38] heart fail because of
[1:10:41] him so this evening let no man's heart
[1:10:45] fail because of whatever you might be
[1:10:48] going through because of whatever
[1:10:52] challenge because of because whatever
[1:10:55] golad because of whatever
[1:10:58] mountain is before you let no man's
[1:11:02] heart
[1:11:04] fail for we are serving the Living
[1:11:09] God and he is
[1:11:11] faithful well we did not bring ourselves
[1:11:14] here he brought us
[1:11:17] here amen and
[1:11:20] uh he's prepared to take us through
[1:11:25] am before he brought us here he already
[1:11:29] already had his own plans amen so I love
[1:11:32] it when brother said that until God has
[1:11:35] finished with us no one can take us away
[1:11:39] no matter what I strongly believe in
[1:11:44] that last year by this time I was very
[1:11:48] sick I was in the US I came in around uh
[1:11:52] July and and uh I stayed for 9 months in
[1:11:56] the US and I was sick very
[1:12:00] sick I had a surgery prostate
[1:12:04] surgery on um 14th of November so last
[1:12:09] year by this time I was sick I could not
[1:12:12] do anything but thank God that today I
[1:12:15] can do all things through Christ that
[1:12:18] strengthens
[1:12:19] me
[1:12:21] Hallelujah I came in and uh
[1:12:24] I was uh you know back home before
[1:12:26] coming I think from May somewhere begin
[1:12:28] to have problem urin and difficulties
[1:12:32] and challenges and and uh and I was so
[1:12:36] much in
[1:12:37] pains I've been to the hospitals have
[1:12:40] been them and day and night I could not
[1:12:43] even
[1:12:45] sleep because they said my prostrate has
[1:12:48] become too big and
[1:12:52] uh and there was element of cancer part
[1:12:56] of
[1:12:59] it when I went to the doctor and the
[1:13:01] doctor told me about that you don't have
[1:13:03] to worry I said no no no I don't fear
[1:13:06] because when it said cancer the only
[1:13:08] thought that came to me was the message
[1:13:10] do you fear
[1:13:13] cancer so I was not
[1:13:17] afraid because I I strongly believe
[1:13:20] that the Lord has a purpose for my life
[1:13:25] for every one of us
[1:13:27] amen and I have to work CET for 9
[1:13:34] months nine good
[1:13:37] months I flew in to the US I was wearing
[1:13:40] it and I was going to the hospital in
[1:13:43] and out they would take it out I said
[1:13:46] take it out they will take it out I will
[1:13:47] come back home I will not be able to pee
[1:13:50] I have to go back oh it
[1:13:52] was bad
[1:13:56] man but thank God I'm standing
[1:14:01] today praise the Lord so let no man's
[1:14:05] heart
[1:14:07] fa until God has finished with man
[1:14:09] nothing can take you from it
[1:14:13] nothing I was
[1:14:16] sick after the surgery they asked me to
[1:14:18] come in to do cystogram they want to see
[1:14:22] 10 days after the
[1:14:24] so they wanted to see if the stitches
[1:14:25] and whatever was healed before they can
[1:14:29] take the catheter I went they did it
[1:14:32] they said no there's a part that is not
[1:14:34] so go and come back another 10
[1:14:37] days so I went back another 10 days or
[1:14:40] two weeks I went 10
[1:14:42] there when
[1:14:44] they I got on the table for the cogr to
[1:14:47] be done I begin to shake the whole table
[1:14:51] was shaking the doctor
[1:14:53] what is that I I don't know was
[1:14:59] so they have to call my wife who brought
[1:15:02] Timothy Aon and then she came and she
[1:15:04] was just standing there and he said all
[1:15:08] the system everything was shutting down
[1:15:11] kidneys everything was faing they tried
[1:15:13] to give drap and said nothing I was not
[1:15:16] able to PE I was and it was just there
[1:15:20] and she said she was just praying and
[1:15:22] somehow
[1:15:24] Grace came down again
[1:15:26] am amen and what I thank God for that
[1:15:29] day is
[1:15:32] even when we left to the hospital I was
[1:15:36] fine at this time the family that we
[1:15:39] were staying with my brother my sister
[1:15:43] and a son they've traveled to Africa so
[1:15:46] we just the two of us myself and my wife
[1:15:48] were
[1:15:49] home and I said Satan you lost you miss
[1:15:52] it again
[1:15:54] because if the challenge I had was H
[1:15:58] happened in the house it would have been
[1:16:00] very difficult because my wife would not
[1:16:02] know what to
[1:16:03] do and the brother that we can call upon
[1:16:06] is 45 minutes drive away so God made it
[1:16:10] that right before the
[1:16:12] doctors this thing happened there so you
[1:16:15] can trust God he's always there and he's
[1:16:19] there on time so let no man's heart
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:25] hallelujah no no and God has finished

[1:16:57] infection when they did a surgery they
[1:17:00] took the the prostrate out and then the
[1:17:02] lymph noes they took it out and then

[1:17:08] in
[1:17:09] Walking I could to LIF my leg was it was
[1:17:13] very difficult I could not walk so the
[1:17:16] brothers provided for me H this zma

[1:19:14] little to be a witness am you must
[1:19:18] suffer a little sir all the people that

[1:19:55] trial you find favor with
[1:19:58] God he said if you have a trial that

[1:20:04] had confidence in job and he said God
[1:20:07] knows you will stand the test somebody
[1:20:10] say praise the Lord
[1:20:11] prise

[1:21:18] grace of the Lord hallelujah amen and
[1:21:22] just know that when God has not finished
[1:21:25] with a man nothing can take him from
[1:21:27] this place
[1:21:29] amen when I have to sit in the car they
[1:21:32] almost some one time they almost pull me
[1:21:35] tried to carry me to put into the car I
[1:21:37] could

[1:21:48] up but by God's grace
[1:21:51] today it is a thing of the
[1:21:55] past and uh in that I just keep
[1:21:58] remembering the
[1:22:00] scriptures and it came to
[1:22:02] pass so I said to myself this also shall
[1:22:09] pass so whatever it be sorry it will
[1:22:13] pass so let no man's heart
[1:22:18] fa we are
[1:22:20] sorry we are not
[1:22:23] in
[1:22:24] picnic we are in a
[1:22:27] battle it's a fight the prophet of God
[1:22:31] said Christianity is not a
[1:22:33] picnic it is a battle between right and
[1:22:37] wrong between the word of God
[1:22:41] and denominationalism or theologies
[1:22:44] contrary to the word of God but the Lord
[1:22:48] has brought us here for sorry for a
[1:22:51] purpose and he will see us
[1:22:54] through amen sorry it will be
[1:23:05] fine
[1:23:07] amen so the Bible tells
[1:23:11] us we are not wrestling against flesh
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:14] blood but against
[1:23:18] principalities against
[1:23:21] Powers against spiritual wickedness in
[1:23:24] high places so we
[1:23:27] admonished we are admonished to put on
[1:23:30] the all armor of
[1:23:32] God Amen so remember it's not a picnic
[1:23:37] it is a fight yes sir and we have to
[1:23:40] fight amen if we fight we
[1:23:42] win because Christ Jesus has already won
[1:23:47] the battle for
[1:23:49] us
[1:23:51] and there David came to the children of
[1:23:54] Israel at this time it was a crisis
[1:23:59] time and I want to remind ourselves that
[1:24:02] the story of Israel has been always
[1:24:07] battle from the days of Abraham you
[1:24:10] remember how
[1:24:12] Abraham gathered the men of his own
[1:24:15] household when lot was
[1:24:17] captured Abraham went against five Kings
[1:24:22] and he defeated them so be assure Israel
[1:24:26] will defeat every enemy as long as they
[1:24:28] are in the promised
[1:24:30] land praise the name of the Lord and uh
[1:24:34] when this Invasion took place over the
[1:24:37] 7th of October for Sunday morning when I
[1:24:39] heard it I was so sad because I was
[1:24:42] going to preach and I was almost crying
[1:24:44] how did it happen because the whole
[1:24:47] world knows about the security of Israel
[1:24:49] how they are so mindful about that but
[1:24:51] what happened
[1:24:54] I thought of many things and I said well
[1:24:57] the Lord might have allowed this to
[1:24:58] happen for a
[1:25:00] purpose but then I was thinking again
[1:25:03] and I said wow what caused
[1:25:05] it Israel was divided at that
[1:25:09] time they were almost fighting one
[1:25:15] another and in their unguided moment the
[1:25:19] enemy came in the enemy just took
[1:25:21] advantage
[1:25:24] because they were fighting accusing one
[1:25:26] another this one say this this one say
[1:25:29] that this one say this this why say
[1:25:32] that so the enemy came
[1:25:36] in and it caused them so
[1:25:39] much never has it ever happened that
[1:25:43] since they became a nation 75 years ago
[1:25:47] that so many Israelites will be killed
[1:25:50] in their own land right some of them
[1:25:54] kidnap I mean it's too much
[1:25:58] but they were fighting among
[1:26:01] themselves we should not be fighting
[1:26:04] among
[1:26:08] ourselves let me just read this little
[1:26:10] thing the prophet
[1:26:13] says I've never talked to I've never
[1:26:16] talked like this
[1:26:19] to a group of people but in this
[1:26:22] locality
[1:26:24] here and throughout the Nations it is
[1:26:27] becoming
[1:26:28] now if the devil can keep us
[1:26:31] separated he's got shooting at one
[1:26:35] another he's got an open
[1:26:39] Target and anywhere he wants to
[1:26:43] shoot and what is the use of shooting we
[1:26:46] are shooting at one another see so he
[1:26:50] can just set back and and
[1:26:53] relax when we begin to shoot at one
[1:26:55] another Satan will get back and relax
[1:26:58] sit back said then we are doing the work
[1:27:01] of the
[1:27:03] devil the prophet said let me just give
[1:27:08] you he said if I have found favor Grace
[1:27:12] in your sight through
[1:27:15] God you take my word for this
[1:27:19] Brethren if you want to be a blessing
[1:27:22] and to get a blessing when a man has

[1:27:54] mention that did we say Amen to that

[1:28:08] prayer before God and don't take it in a
[1:28:12] way of just selfish and say well I'm

[1:28:22] shoulder and stand in the presence of

[1:34:23] never be
[1:34:26] bitter no matter what is done against
[1:34:29] you we sing the song Fe my way every day
[1:34:32] with love what does the scripture tells
[1:34:36] us Jesus said love your neighbor and
[1:34:39] love your enemy and love one another
[1:34:43] right he say so so as I've said to many
[1:34:47] people in many
[1:34:49] places all my wife is like this or your
[1:34:52] your husband is like this or this
[1:34:53] brother is like that or that sister is
[1:34:55] like this

[1:35:00] a brother love that fellow as your
[1:35:03] neighbor
[1:35:04] amen if you cannot love that fellow as
[1:35:07] your neighbor love that fellow as your
[1:35:09] enemy because Jesus said love your
[1:35:14] enemies you say your wife you can't love
[1:35:17] her as a wife love her as your neighbor
[1:35:20] or your husband love him as neighbor if
[1:35:22] you cannot love him as your neighbor
[1:35:24] love him as your enemy because he said
[1:35:26] love your
[1:35:28] enemies
[1:35:30] so we have no we have no way out I'm
[1:35:34] telling you that's why brother ABR told
[1:35:36] us love is the strongest
[1:35:39] weapon when it is put to test it will
[1:35:41] defeat the strongest
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:45] enemy Brothers the only way we can serve
[1:35:48] God in spirit and in truth in sincerity
[1:35:52] is to lose our
[1:35:54] minds Hallelujah and the Bible say let
[1:35:57] this mind which was in Christ be in you
[1:36:00] you cannot serve god with your own
[1:36:03] mind I think and I feel no no you can't
[1:36:05] make it you have to lose your mind
[1:36:11] am beloved why are we in this condition
[1:36:15] is because we are too much alive to
[1:36:18] ourselves if all that we have been
[1:36:20] hearing if you and I we have been
[1:36:23] applying this things in our lives we'll
[1:36:25] be out of here by
[1:36:28] now amen dear ones time is not on our
[1:36:32] side the Lord is coming we can see with
[1:36:36] what is happening in the word today that
[1:36:38] we don't have to ding ding we don't have
[1:36:41] to play church we have to be up and be
[1:36:44] doing
[1:36:45] amen because time is not look at what is
[1:36:49] happening in Israel what Israel that is
[1:36:52] God's
[1:36:54] timetable Israel natural is a type of
[1:36:57] the Israel
[1:36:58] spiritual right and so remember this
[1:37:01] that our enemies are always looking for
[1:37:03] an opportunity to strike
[1:37:05] us your enemy the Bible say our enemy
[1:37:09] the devil our adversary the devil as a
[1:37:12] rolling lion walking about seeking who
[1:37:14] he made
[1:37:16] devile so we are not in picnic we are in
[1:37:19] a battle so we have to put on the o
[1:37:23] Armor of God so that we'll be able to
[1:37:26] stand in this
[1:37:27] hour brother Bram said to miss church
[1:37:31] service is better to miss work a day's
[1:37:33] work that's right I know you would not
[1:37:36] say Amen
[1:37:40] today
[1:37:43] amen may God have preeminence in our
[1:37:48] lives praise the Lord
[1:37:52] Jesus told us if you put your hand on
[1:37:54] the prow and look back you are not fit
[1:37:57] for the
[1:38:00] kingdom we had to
[1:38:03] fight as soldiers of the
[1:38:07] Cross and if we fight we'll win because
[1:38:10] God is on our side amen and I've always
[1:38:14] said to people it is not good for us to
[1:38:18] be comparing ourselves with one another
[1:38:20] amen it's not good it's not right
[1:38:23] because we are made differently for
[1:38:26] different
[1:38:27] purposes as we are here we are not all
[1:38:29] the same we have tall slim whatever
[1:38:33] whatever you want to call
[1:38:35] it different shape of heads you can see
[1:38:39] my own head it's different from
[1:38:42] yours and the prophet of God said listen
[1:38:46] don't try to be somebody
[1:38:48] else because we are made k seriously we
[1:38:52] are made differently to serve different
[1:38:54] purposes even in the house of
[1:38:59] God oh you say nobody knows me that's
[1:39:02] the devil's deceiving you God knows you
[1:39:06] nobody sees what I'm doing don't forget
[1:39:08] about forget about that whether anybody
[1:39:10] see you or nobody sees you do what God
[1:39:12] want you to
[1:39:13] do where nobody agrees with you fine so
[1:39:17] what if nobody agrees so what amen God
[1:39:21] if they don't agree with you sit down do
[1:39:23] what you have to do you need to have a
[1:39:27] revelation of the purpose of God for
[1:39:29] your
[1:39:33] life and when you know that God want you
[1:39:36] to stand here then stand
[1:39:39] there no matter what the opposition
[1:39:42] might be amen if you know who you are
[1:39:45] and you know your position and your
[1:39:47] place in Christ stand there and God will
[1:39:49] take you through amen
[1:39:52] praise the name of the
[1:39:54] Lord let no man's heart
[1:39:57] fail David came under the sin in this
[1:40:00] great hour of need when the children of
[1:40:03] Israel it say they were in the corner
[1:40:05] they didn't know what to do but I'm glad
[1:40:08] that when we don't know what to do he
[1:40:10] knows what to do
[1:40:12] am he is the way the truth in the life
[1:40:16] and it makes way where there is no way
[1:40:18] and I want you to know this that God
[1:40:20] still making way for his people he's
[1:40:22] still making way and he will make a way
[1:40:23] for you so let not your heart
[1:40:27] fail don't look at yourself say oh ask
[1:40:30] for me nobody cares no who told you
[1:40:33] that don't let the devil prain a picture
[1:40:35] to you that you are the one that is
[1:40:37] suffering more than anybody in this
[1:40:38] world that's a
[1:40:40] lie don't forget he's a liar from the
[1:40:43] beginning and he's still telling lies so
[1:40:46] don't believe it's lie that tells you
[1:40:49] you nobody like you and nobody cares for
[1:40:51] you and nobody is interested in you
[1:40:53] that's a lie when he bring you to that
[1:40:56] condition then you have pity for
[1:40:59] yourself and self-pity is
[1:41:02] sin and then you want to separate
[1:41:05] yourself from your brothers because the
[1:41:08] devil has painted a picture to you that
[1:41:10] your brothers and your sisters they
[1:41:11] don't like
[1:41:13] you so that when people even greet you
[1:41:16] wonder whether it's from their
[1:41:19] heart yeah I was talking said brother if

[1:41:48] word that has been given to us we've
[1:41:49] have the doctrines and Revelations and
[1:41:51] this one and that one and that one
[1:41:53] brother Bram said if any good thing will
[1:41:55] come to
[1:41:56] us it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:41:59] of God Amen it has to be confirmed by
[1:42:01] the word of God sorry
[1:42:05] amen and it has to be made manifest by
[1:42:08] the fruits by the results amen so look
[1:42:11] at the results that com from your life
[1:42:13] then you will know whether God is in
[1:42:15] control or whoever is in control amen

[1:42:46] Breen listen our coming and going should
[1:42:49] not be in vain
[1:42:53] the word has been delivered to us what
[1:42:55] are we doing with what has been
[1:42:56] delivered to
[1:42:58] us we tend to forget easily when God has
[1:43:03] done things for
[1:43:04] us because if Israel did not forget they
[1:43:08] would not have been afraid of
[1:43:10] golad because what didn't God do for
[1:43:14] them living
[1:43:16] Egypt through the
[1:43:18] supernatural the mighty work of Jehovah
[1:43:21] think about it they look Beyond and they
[1:43:24] didn't see what God even has done in
[1:43:26] their personal lives for you to wear one
[1:43:28] dress for 40 years and it didn't grow
[1:43:33] old you don't have to go far to see
[1:43:36] Miracle wearing one clothes for 40 years
[1:43:39] walking for 40 years and the shoes they
[1:43:41] wear there was no problem with it there
[1:43:44] was no cracks at the back of their
[1:43:46] feet and they forget that and many at
[1:43:50] times we forget it we are looking around
[1:43:52] here and there and you know it's so
[1:43:54] pitiful that sometime we looking at the
[1:43:57] one ahead of us oh I want to be like
[1:44:00] look at that brother look at this and
[1:44:01] that and that and all that God is doing
[1:44:04] around you you don't see
[1:44:06] nothing because you are looking at
[1:44:08] somebody else and the Beautiful part is
[1:44:10] that somebody also is looking at you
[1:44:12] some somebody wish ah I wish I'm like
[1:44:15] this brother here I wish I'm like this
[1:44:16] sister look at a husband look at a wife
[1:44:19] look at it and you also are looking at
[1:44:20] somebody
[1:44:21] else so when we should be giving thanks
[1:44:24] to
[1:44:25] God oh no we see God has failed us God
[1:44:29] has disappoint why did God disappoint
[1:44:31] you is because we become greedy and
[1:44:33] Covetous yes yes that's right cover not
[1:44:37] your neighbor's wife cover not your
[1:44:38] neighbor's husband cover not your
[1:44:40] neighbor's Farm cover not your
[1:44:41] neighbor's anything is that not the word
[1:44:43] of the
[1:44:44] Lord
[1:44:46] amen hallelujah amen may the Lord Jesus
[1:44:50] help us
[1:44:53] take God at his word if they have G
[1:44:55] remember the word what God did for them
[1:44:58] but they forgot
[1:45:00] it because they were looking around and
[1:45:02] they want to be like other
[1:45:05] people listen I've said it listening
[1:45:08] it's not good for us to be comparing
[1:45:11] ourselves with one another because we
[1:45:13] are made differently for different
[1:45:14] purpos amen and I said Peter was in jail
[1:45:19] one day he was in prison
[1:45:22] and the Believers prayed and the angel
[1:45:24] of the Lord came in
[1:45:26] Midnight why he came in Midnight that is
[1:45:29] his own choice he did not come midnight
[1:45:32] because he was afraid of
[1:45:34] soldiers are you understanding that he
[1:45:37] was not afraid of the soldiers but he
[1:45:39] choose to come that hour because the
[1:45:41] people were praying at that time and to
[1:45:44] let us know that God answers prayer he
[1:45:46] came me at midnight and I want to say to
[1:45:49] you that when the age of the the Lord
[1:45:50] came to the prison he was not working
[1:45:52] like
[1:45:54] this so that nobody will hear no he was
[1:45:58] in charge of
[1:46:00] everything and I want you to know he's
[1:46:02] in charge of everything
[1:46:04] today I want you to remember that Peter
[1:46:07] was sleeping between two people two
[1:46:10] soldiers in Chains but the chain fell
[1:46:12] off and it came out amen and I pray that
[1:46:15] your chains also will fall out so that
[1:46:18] you will come out from where you are
[1:46:20] buried from whatever situation you are
[1:46:22] in from whatever habit you are in
[1:46:25] whatever has changed you may God make
[1:46:27] your change to fall so that you rise

[1:47:27] the message the god that has make us to

[2:03:19] amen so David could not have come
[2:03:21] earlier than when he came he could not

[2:04:31] God at the backs side of the
[2:04:33] desert men of
[2:04:36] experience men and women that have met

[2:07:47] better
[2:07:56] you almost have to say is it done
[2:08:00] already you know I believe that even in
[2:08:04] an army as we heard about tonight armies
[2:08:07] have generals and I believe in God's
[2:08:10] Army we just heard from a
[2:08:12] general we heard from a battle scarred
[2:08:14] veteran someone that knows God is real
[2:08:19] I believe we were we were spoken to
[2:08:22] tonight I know the Lord spoke to me
[2:08:23] directly and if nobody else got anything
[2:08:26] I can certainly say this was for me
[2:08:28] tonight what a tremendous
[2:08:31] service what a tremendous disservice we
[2:08:33] do if we come here and we don't
[2:08:35] worship we know that Jesus said the
[2:08:38] Rocks would cry out immediately if the
[2:08:41] people won't and you know we've said it
[2:08:43] in the past I think it's so
[2:08:45] good everybody probably knows it but I'm
[2:08:48] just going to going to say it we didn't
[2:08:49] talk about a thing I didn't talk to
[2:08:50] brother Timothy until he was in the
[2:08:52] office at the back and we never spoke
[2:08:54] about anything this is the Lord that
[2:08:56] spoke tonight if if you felt something
[2:08:59] twinge in your heart from what was said
[2:09:02] that was God dealing with you directly
[2:09:05] and it's just so important to recognize
[2:09:07] brothers and sisters we're coming to the
[2:09:08] place where we're not going to be
[2:09:10] talking about quotes and tapes and books
[2:09:12] and and and even coming to church the
[2:09:14] only thing we're going to have is
[2:09:16] worship and our desire to worship God
[2:09:18] and and and if we don't have that desire
[2:09:21] then maybe we ought to try and find that
[2:09:23] desire because that's what it's all
[2:09:25] about is worshiping God and uh anyways
[2:09:28] what a tremendous what a tremendous time
[2:09:32] tonight let's just bow in
[2:09:34] prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[2:09:37] thankful that you are gracious amen Lord

[2:10:09] give us a helping hand to recognize that
[2:10:12] your incomplete control there's no
[2:10:14] reason for our hearts to fail
[2:10:16] us the only reason is because we do it
[2:10:20] to
[2:10:21] ourselves and father we just ask tonight
[2:10:24] that Lord you would restore brother
[2:10:26] Timothy's
