ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Hallelujah if you have your Bibles tonight thank you musicians have your Bibles tonight I just want to read from Matthew chapter 14. maybe a little bit of a look back at something we've already talked about just from a different angle excuse me Matthew chapter 14. it's one verse tonight verse 27. straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful that you first loved us because that's the only reason we could love you father tonight Lord Jesus we all have needs in our lives we all have situations and problems circumstances Lord that we just don't even know how to navigate but we know that your word is Eternal Father and that all heavens and earth will pass away and father many times we look for tremendous miracles in our lives and signs and wonders but Lord we know that you you said to us through your Prophet that the greatest Miracle is that a man father could recognize his sinful nature Lord and just commit his life into your hands and that you could convert that man that you could see that man be transformed by the renewing of his mind according to your word that he could become a new creature in Christ Jesus father help us to remember help us to recognize the greatest Miracle ever performed Lord Jesus that a man could be transformed into the very image of God Lord we just Commit This service into your hands we ask that you would bless the reading of the word as we go forwards father we just love you and we thank you we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a couple of announcements for this weekend coming up we have the passion play on Saturday and sure it'll be a wonderful time of fellowship and just enjoying each other's company in Drum Heller um I felt led to ask brother Ben ogu to take the service for us on Sunday I know that his time is short with us although he's been here for a while he's traveling to Edmonton next week and he agreed to take the service on Sunday so we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has placed on our brother's heart so uh pray for our brother I'm sure they'll put him to work in Edmonton when he goes there as well but so we have the passion play on Saturday and then brother Ben will take the service on Sunday are you happy tonight and believe it or not I'm happy too I just can't help but get emotional when I get in his presence bear with me for one more I uh I'm certainly thankful in my life I'm I would say 99 over this thing that uh attacked me as well certainly wonderful to recognize the the word of the Lord in our lives tonight I want to go back to Matthew chapter 14 and uh and just dwell on this a little bit I think it's real important for us to recognize that when we're going through our circumstances it's uh it's important to remember that he's there with us and and to not look at it from the circumstance where our situations can become even spooky and we know that that's what brother Branham talked about and we'll get into that a little bit but in this story here I think it's amazing I was just studying it again looking at it and thinking you know the disciples they were in the ship but why were they in the ship they were there because Jesus constrained them to get into the ship they had the 5 000 being fed just men not including women and children so we didn't even know how many thousands of people were fed in the story just before this a tremendous campaign and we know there must have been a lot of virtue that went out of Jesus to to have that scenario happen but but all that Mighty sign and wonder that that Mighty service that they had Jesus finally came to the place where he said enough and he constrained the people to go home he said you got to go home the show's over we can't do anything more for you the services are over we had a great meeting uh go home and talk about the special services and study the notes that you took from the weekend and the disciples you too need to go and what did Jesus do he went up to a high mountain apart he sent them into the ship and then he went to pray and I just can't help but wonder what did he go to pray about what was he doing while he was praying there you know who's whose names did he mention when he was praying on that mountain but those disciples were in that boat that started to get tossed around like a bottle stopper brother Brown talks about and and they're in the water and and they're a few furlongs out about an eighth of a mile from Shore is what they say and uh what happened was the ship started to get tossed about the wind started to get contrary with that ship while they were in it and I can only imagine if I was one of those disciples I'd be thinking man here we are in the midst of this ship now in the midst of this storm here and this is what Jesus told us to do he's the one that put us here brothers and sisters how easy can it be for us in our lives to think that sometimes we go through trials and to think that Jesus allows for these trials to happen and you know what I'm going to say that I'm just guilty I'm I'm number one at the front of the line to admit that I am guilty of saying Lord why would you do this to me why do we have to go through these things and I'll just give you the little testimony I was sharing with brother Logan after service on Sunday with the dog when I ran over my dog it sounds like a stupid testimony maybe for those people that don't have pets or don't understand what it means to have a dog and and so we have this dog and I I ran it over with a machine at our house and and I thought I killed it I really did and I'm not saying that I'm I'm I'm glory in in the situation and how terrible it was but it was terrible she was screaming and yelling and I thought that I literally killed her and she finally got to the place where she just went limp and laid down and wasn't making any more noise and she started to close her eyes and I I cried out to God I said Lord why do we have to have these circumstances what is this and then she started to revive a little bit and I thought I better rush to the vet I better just take her to the vet I know it's just going to be thousands of dollars and a big problem and gonna have to tell the family I just killed the dog and now we got all this situation that was so avoidable why am I in this boat is what I was thinking and so here we go down the highway I'm almost to the vet and I started to really just not get angry but frustrated to think why why why why and I'm just trying to be honest here so you understand my perception of this my perspective here I'm not trying to say that anybody else I can only deal with my own circumstances my own experience but it just became so real to me and I had a few days of this why and the vet he started to tell me that you know we can't really see any broken bones we did X-rays and there's not really very many broken bones we can't see any broken bones for that matter and and we do an ultrasound and we can't see any damaged organs and I'm thinking my goodness and he said you know one other thing the thing that I think is surprising he said to me take a look at this and she was in there she had an IV attached to her and she could tell she was groggy she was on drugs it's just a dog I know it's just a stupid dog but you know what one time God used just a stupid possum to actually create a point a situation God deals with us the way that we need to be dealt with brothers and sisters and clearly I needed to be dealt with this way so I go out and I see her sitting on the table and the vet's there and he says you know there's one more thing that you need to know when animals get hit by Vehicles they usually always get chipped teeth or broken teeth he said look at her teeth there's not one damaged tooth in her mouth are you sure she was hit I was doing about 40 kilometers an hour and she she got hit you know I was there I saw it and some people might say well you know it couldn't have been that bad right if you would see her at our house now you'd see her wagon her tail people might think that they'll say well it could have really been that bad and you know what I know I was there I witnessed it sometimes we need to talk about these things we need to remember the circumstances that Jesus allows us to go through he tells us constrains us to get in the boat but brothers and sisters I still had this thing in my heart this thing why why why would we do this why why it took until Sunday that was probably about it was Wednesday I remember I texted the deacons and said hey I don't know if I'm going to make it to church tonight I'm not sure if it's going to happen because I'm at the Vets right now with this emergency so I don't know what's going to happen but we were we were uh I went from Wednesday until Sunday and it was Sunday morning on the way to church I was having this why conversation just inside my heart not talking to anybody just it's just there you know how it is when you have a thought and you just can't understand it you can't reconcile it it's just continually there I had this thought and and and on the way to church distinctly remember driving up the road out of Okotoks I this why and and I believe the Lord just said to me very clearly so that I could show you that I'm still with you just be of good cheer it is I and when you're in a situation brothers and sisters you're not there by accident we're not in a situation by accident it's so that he can show us that he's with us but sometimes it can seem spooky to us the situation seems so strange and naturally speaking I was telling brother Logan I'll just say it because it's it just really struck me in the moment I was so sweaty and so clammy in the situation I had a puddle of sweat on the console of my vehicle just from my arm I was like oh it's all wet I must have spilled some water and I never spilled any water I didn't have any water I was just in this fog of mine trying to rush to the vet what a situation but I could look at it now and say thank you Lord but in the moment sometimes it's very difficult and I just want to say tonight brothers and sisters sometimes we can look at a situation and think why but if we can just stop thinking about the why and start remembering the who because if we can remember the who all the rest of it doesn't matter because if we can remember that he is with us in the situation it doesn't matter it will turn out for the good talking about this this testimony thing tonight I I just want to just make a point of of of mentioning another thing that that I experienced in you know sometimes it can seem a little bit weird but testimony services are important they're very important I had another one where I I was in a situation that was a really good one All Things Considered I had uh just changed jobs I moved from one job to another job and I was working for a a man in in his building and I was working all night I was doing an all-night job I needed to work overnight and this is when I was a believer excuse me and I was working in this building and it was an empty building and it was a big building and uh in a sort of a crime kind of an area of the city and as I was working in this building I was listening to the message it was beautiful I could just turn it up loud and I could just you know go from one place to the other place to do my job and and just listen and I I don't know I probably listened to three messages and in between the messages I would pray and while I was praying and and listening I would be singing and I was just having a little Jubilee with the Lord it was incredible and I'd start to get tired and I just thanked the Lord and maybe drink a little more coffee and just keep going and singing and and and worshiping and just having this time and and going back and forth through this building really large building and you know while I was working there something happened really significant something really significant happened I felt a presence come in behind me in this building and and in the moment I got so scared I didn't know what was happening it actually literally made the hair stand up on my head I was I was shocked by the feeling that I was encountering and and so immediately I start to think oh it's a devil oh it's it's a bad thing it's it's terrible and I start to rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ and oh no oh and you know I took it from that situation it wasn't very long after that the police were at the door they're like you know this area is uh common for crime and and we're not sure who you are and we want to see some ID we just want to check and make sure that you're not actually robbing the place and I said no no I'm just doing a night shift work in here as a carpenter it's you know it's all good but I I again I wondered what was that what was that but I believe the Lord showed me were you not actually worshiping were you not listening were you not calling upon the name of the Lord for hours that night all night long and finally I come to you and you don't even recognize me what a tremendous thing brothers and sisters that's just me and my experience and and something that I encountered in my life I'm not saying that everyone should have that or or maybe someone I don't know whether you understand even what I'm talking about but what I'm saying is we need to be able to recognize his presence when he comes and that should not be uncommon for us we should actually be more surprised when he's not with us but it really made me think you know about this scripture here you know the ship was in the midst of the sea tossed with waves and the wind was contrary and the Fourth Watch of the night between three and six in the morning in the wee wee hours of the morning it's about the time it happened to me I guess that's what makes this kind of real to me you know what here we have the disciples in this boat in the situation in the Fourth Watch of the night this is verse 25 of Matthew chapter 14. Jesus went unto them walking on the sea so isn't it amazing to think that the sea was contrary to their situation in that boat that Jesus constrained them to get into but on the top of that storm Jesus walked to them in that storm Jesus came to them he didn't just come to them on the beach where it was all nice and calm he sent them out into the boat and then he came to them but what happened when he came to them verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear for me when I think about this I think wow maybe I'm not so crazy you know brother Ed biskel he gives the testimony um I'm not even sure where they are I think they might be on YouTube if anybody's interested they're powerful testimonies about how he interacted with the prophet of God but one of the last ones he talks about I think it is he explains how he was in the front seat of a car with the prophet of God and how the angel of the Lord came down into the car between them and he said the hair on brother branham's face it bristled out straight he said you just wanted to die when you're in that presence because as a man you can't hardly stand being in the presence of God when it's that that real that powerful but it's it's frightening if we're not used to it and I think that brother Bradham even said it someone could clarify this or correct me I think brother brownham said you can never get used to it never get used to his presence because we can't see God in this flesh and live but when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid if I if I had to stop right here and just say this is it for the service tonight which I'm not gonna but if I did I just would say this brothers and sisters be of good cheer because the I am is here be of good cheer Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid of the situation the circumstance the problems the issues whatever it is don't be afraid because he is here and we know brother Branham says that many times he is here he's not coming he is here because brother random said it many times also if you can't believe the works that I do hahaha believe oh my oh I'm just going to read a quote here uh uh it's sort of be not afraid 1961-0224 you know they thought this was spooky they thought that the spirit walking on the water while they were in the storm in the ship that Jesus told them to get into and the position that they found themselves in was exactly where Jesus put them isn't it paragraph 61 says so he came walking to him on the water their last hour all Hope's gone what happened as soon as they seen him just the same as they did then they're doing today as soon as they seen him they're doing today just exactly the same as they did then they're doing today the only thing that could help them they was afraid of it I just want to pause there and think about that you know what I can speak from my own experience and tell you that the only reason why would I be afraid of it I can tell you why I'd be afraid of it because I might have condemnation in my heart something that I know that I haven't done or something that I know that I've done and I shouldn't have and I just haven't made that right so when I have this situation in my life Jesus doesn't go anywhere he's always there but there's something in us that restricts us from actually being able to contact him and say wow I don't have to be afraid I don't have to actually think that this situation is is my last hope but why do people get afraid why are people scared I can tell you I'm I'm super encouraged after talking to sister Tina today because she said I'm not afraid I you know the doctor said to her you can have the solution that we've got and and that's our solution for you and she said well you know there's one more solution that I'm waiting for she said those words and she said I'm not afraid if if God decides to take me home then then that's his will for my life and I'm not afraid of that what a tremendous testimony but you know even amongst Believers and I would say myself I've been this way I've been afraid and the only reason that is is because I know that I don't have it actually sorted out properly there's still something maybe lingering there and you know brothers and sisters as long as there's something there in our lives Satan is going to come around and he's going to have the ability to harass us but remember we said it on Sunday I've quoted it many times and I think it's so beautiful sometimes we just need to refresh on some of the quotes and maybe I probably need to refresh on a lot of them some people might say I think I would say that too but you know it's full obedience entitles us to the Token right we can say that many times and I've said it that way so many times but it's not just full obedience brothers and sisters because full obedience to what full obedience to the entire word entitles us to the Token full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token we can't just say I'm going to say full obedience to what William Mary and Bradham said because he's a man and he said you know what if you can't take my word for it take the word of God for it he was a man and he was fallible unfortunately but God wanted it to be that way because he said just like John the Baptist I must decrease so what so that he could increase and the same thing has to be in our lives we've got to be willing to die out to ourselves so that he can increase in our lives but he come walking to him on the water their last hour all Hope's gone what happened as soon as they seen him just the same as they did then they're doing today the only thing that could help them they was afraid of it they took it as spooky he's a spirit brother Bradham says in the same thing today why I think this is astounding when I read this because I know I've experienced it and I don't ever want to do that when I call upon the name of the Lord I want to know that it's him that's coming and you know what Satan's not going to come around when we're calling on the Lord he doesn't want nothing to do with the angels of the Lord he doesn't want nothing to do with God when we get on our knees and we start calling on the name of the Lord he's going to come and try and mess with our mind he'll try and maybe get the kids to yell he'll try and cause all this different distractions that he can do but you know what he doesn't want to come anywhere near us he ain't going to have nothing to do with us it's only going to be God brother Adam goes on to say you Baptist you Methodist you Presbyterian Catholic you Pentecostals Oneness threeness fiveness assemblies Foursquare whatever you may be I'll pause there too because we could say message the message doesn't save us Christ Jesus saves us but when we understand what the message is it's the revelation of Jesus Christ then we understand what we're talking about here and what I mean by this for fiveness assemblies four square whatever you may be you're God's children but don't be afraid God promised he would do it if he could speak tonight imagine this this is the prophet of God the prophet of God is God's mouthpiece and here we have the prophet of God as his mouthpiece saying this if God could speak tonight I think this is amazing if if God could speak tonight he'd say as it was then when they were all scared well said we've seen a spirit it looks spooky there's something strange about it said do not fear it is I the same yesterday today and forever be not afraid it is I brother Branham says won't you church tonight let him in your little bark as you're sailing over life solemn Maine won't you just open up your heart and say Lord Jesus I believe you I'm willing I know that scripture the man's told me what is the scripture I know that the Bible said you're the same yesterday today and forever I know these things I just think it's such an amazing thing so beautiful Jesus told the disciples get in the boat knowing full well what was coming he wasn't surprised God is never surprised when he tells us to go a certain direction and we go that certain direction and then we have the situation he's not surprised and you know what when we surprise ourselves with how we act in the circumstances and the situations in our lives even though we're surprised and sometimes all the people around us are surprised he's not surprised he's still not surprised we can't surprise God we can't shock him with our lives it doesn't make an occasion for us to sin it doesn't mean that we can actually just go off in a in a different direction and act a different way than what a Believer would would act we don't want to make Grace a disgrace we're not doing that what I'm trying to do tonight brothers and sisters just to speak plainly is to encourage our faith to recognize the faith lies in the church and if we don't preach Faith then faith is just going to lie dormant we need to recognize that he is the same yesterday today and forever not just for some church out there somewhere maybe some great ministry somewhere but for me right now in my situation in my circumstances he is the same yesterday today and forever he told me to go this way and maybe I went a little bit of a different way but he knew that I would go that way I just was thinking today about Jonah you know the world would say that Jonah is a backslider he's a backslidden prophet but brother Bradham he said it very clearly he was not a backslider he was in God's will he was doing God's will because those people would never have received him or his word had a fish never spat him up on the ocean on the sea from the ocean on the beach from the ocean from the sea you know what I'm saying confusing myself here but you know what I mean he he he wasn't surprised God wasn't surprised by his behavior he knew exactly where he was he knew he had iniquity in his heart again being in a ship that was tossed contrary to the to the way it should be with the ship and he knew he had iniquity in his heart and he said you know what just throw me over could you imagine that just biting my hands and my feet and throw me over because I deserve to die I know that I've transgressed the direction of God God knew exactly what he would do and God took him and saved him and when he was in that position long enough he remembered that scripture you know what when I'm in the midst of my circumstance I'm just going to look I'm going to raise my eyes and I'm going to look towards the temple of God because therein lies my salvation therein lies my God that is the way I'm gonna go and if I ever have another chance in my life I'm just gonna go straight the way that God shows me how many times in our lives have we encountered that I've gone through the circumstance I'm in the midst of my trial and I know that I made a mistake I know that I'd done wrong but I'm just gonna just Lord commit it into your hands and if it Be Your Will for me to live to see another day I'm just going to serve you with all my might and all of my heart he wants us to get to that place brothers and sisters he wants to be able to demonstrate that he's God in our lives in our moment in our situation he doesn't want us to be wondering if he's God he wants to show us that I am the same yesterday today and forever in your life in our lives I'm so thankful for that I just have to say Thank You Lord you might wonder why you're so thanking the lord tonight in your prayers because I know that he's in control brothers and sisters I look at sister Tina's condition tonight and I think my goodness the doctors want to tell her you've got this device now you're going to have to put this device on and wear it like a pack everywhere you go now and that's their only solution but here we have a sister saying hey you know what I know that God's my healer and I'm willing to die believing that he's my healer because I'm not afraid I know that if I die I'm going to be with God because I'm not going to die you can never kill me as a Believer I think we need to have that resolve when that happens you know what happens you know what happens Satan's powerless before you it's not just a revelation it's not just understanding the seals it's not just understanding that God sent a prophet that that that that that the Gates of Hell won't be able to Prevail against us it's not understanding that Revelation although that Revelation is what will release us from this Human Condition into the heavenlies but it's not understanding the theories it's coming as a little child it's just accepting his word and saying hey I believe that and I'm willing to accept it the way that you've given it to us and I'm not going to put any theology on I'm not going to put any any ideas and and traditions or cultures or anything on it I'm just going to say be it unto me according to Thy Word I love how brother Branham says it that's why I'm talking this way it's because of what he said he said don't try to figure it out don't don't try to understand it says you tell your little girl you're going to get her something she just believes it that's all and I think it's beautiful how he brings this to his campaign to to The Healing Ministry the the present moment in his life he says your children just believes it when you say you're going to get them something he says that's all watch children when they get to the pulpit not to preach but in the prayer line watch children when they get to the pulpit watch and see if every one of them isn't healed because they just believe it that's all watch them when they're called on the platform out there no matter what's wrong with them when they're called out there watch them jump to their feet no matter if they're crippled blind whatever it is watch them receive it right now but the elderly ones will set around and say now wait I can't move I haven't moved this foot for a long time a child won't think of that he will just jump to his feet right now I say Lord help me to jump to my feet right now because I've got things in my life aches and pains I brought up to the prayer meetings specific requests there's things in my life that I I really would like to see the Lord move on and maybe that's what I need to do maybe I just need to jump to my feet right now and say just just amen Lord be it unto me I'm either going to damage myself further or you're going to heal my body and I trust that you'll heal my body and you know I don't want to push us that way either because we can make Grace a disgrace we can tell people to go and do things that are contrary to just common sense don't do that don't do that just me speaking here but we've got to live by faith brothers and sisters faith in a word that was delivered to us for a purpose the purpose of it brothers and sisters isn't so that we can have a good fellowship and and live together in harmony and and have a wonderful Church body that can help one another when we're down and and so on and so forth that's not it we're we're given this perfect word and we're given a perfect Faith to to marry with that perfect word as husband and wife so that that perfect word will give us that perfect Faith which will in turn be called rapturing Faith which will absolutely change these bodies in the moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the promise for our age and we do have that promise it's coming it's imminent we can see it all around us this world is seemingly fall apart falling apart but remember like we said on Sunday I just want to say it again you know what it's not that world that's putting the pressure on the bride and going to squeeze the bride out of here it's the bride's presence that's putting the squeeze on this world it truly is the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in his bride that's causing all the rest of this fanaticism to take place and one of these days grace is going to lift off of this world the Bride of Jesus Christ will no longer be here and we're not going to want to be here when that time comes and we won't be by the grace of God Brother Brad I'm talking about the child here he says he will do but we try to figure it all out we got to figure it out getting into our story now going a little bit further one of the other parts of it maybe we can just read read in the Bible here just carrying on from verse 27. before we go any further with this quote it's notable what happened in this situation verse 28 of Matthew chapter 14. and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and what did Jesus say he didn't say oh no you can't do it only I can or nope only the Bishop can only the ministry maybe just the deacons or the evangelist no and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water I just think it's beautiful he walked on the water why to go to Jesus he'll make a way for us brothers and sisters I think it's so beautiful and I just want to pause here and and just labor on this point Peter got down out of the ship and walked on the water can you imagine that it wasn't just Jesus that was walking on the water it was Peter also and why because he had faith enough to say Lord if it's you then bid me to come allow me to come unto you and I just want to say this tonight brothers and sisters remember that water wasn't actually smooth glass it wasn't perfect water this was stormy water but yet he walked on it which means that he was above it remember when the enemy comes in like a flood brothers and sisters the spirit of God raises a Peter above it and I want to encourage us tonight when the spirit of God when this sorry when the spirit of the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it and and here we have the situation where Peter now caught in the midst of this storm he has this desire as he was that was his nature to Just Launch out with whatever the first thought that came to his mind he's just right there right on it and and he is saying okay if that's you then then then then let me come unto you how many of us can say that tonight in the midst of our storms brothers and sisters when we have that situation in our lives and it gets spooky and we don't understand what's going on can we just say Lord if you're here just let me come out to you just let me walk on top of this storm don't let me have to sink down in it but we know in verse 30 it says but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and he beginning and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt Jesus was right there he could see him right there he already identified that that was him right there he was already climbed down out of the ship right there he was already walking on the water right there but yet what did he do he looked at his circumstances he looked at the wind he looked at the waves maybe he looked back at the disciples maybe he looked and saw the fear on his brother's faces in the midst of the situation instead of staying where he was walking on the water fear took over him and he began to sink and I just can't help but think tonight brothers and sisters we have been called not to sink we've been called not to cry out to Jesus because we're of little faith and we're going under and we're just barely making it I think that's the position of maybe the denominational Christian that's the position of someone that hasn't really recognized the true presence of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever according to the message of the hour someone who truly recognized that he has forgiven me and I have been able to just accept his forgiveness brothers and sisters we don't have to be falling down in the water and as I'm talking remember I'm preaching to me I'm thinking about myself driving up the hill I don't have to think I'm sinking into this problem in this situation and be crying out to God why now I can look at the situation and say Amen something's happening Jesus is here and he's going to keep me above this water doesn't matter how wet that console is I'm going to be above it doesn't matter if my dog dies she's gonna be there when I get over there doesn't matter what happens if this flesh gets destroyed there's a brand new body already waiting for me it doesn't matter if I'm not present in this flesh because I'll be present with God brother Adam says he'll do it but we try to figure it all out we got to figure it out what if Peter stopped that night to figure it out now Lord you told me to walk on the water now let me see now I'm strictly a scientist and I know the formula of water is H2O why no man can walk on hydrogen and oxygen it's just proven scientifically that that's not possible right no man can walk on hydrogen and oxidant there's no need for me trying that why would I try it because it's just not humanly possible but brothers and sisters remember his will is his word and his word says that all things are possible to those who believe not some things and not many things but all things are possible to those who believe why no man can walk on hydrogen and oxygen there's no need of me trying that how many times you ever hear someone say stuff like that as a Believer oh there's no need of trying that I don't know if I'd do that that's maybe a little bit crazy you might actually cause a bit of a problem if you do that I want to say this when we talk about this level of Faith brothers and sisters this isn't just let's let's just lay hands on you and we'll have a prayer meeting and things will get better this is truly the revelation of Jesus Christ alive and well in your life and and until you know him that way that you walk with him and you talk with him and and you have that communion that fellowship with him don't try anything fundamental I don't want to try and get us to go and walk out in front of a bus because we know God will save us if this body be destroyed this earthy Tabernacle be destroyed we have a new body waiting for us no no we don't want to we don't want to tempt God we don't want to make Grace a disgrace we want to recognize that as we live our lives according to the word of God as Believers in our day when the Devil comes around because he's simply a tool in the hand of God God's going to say go and get this accomplished in my brother or my sister's life in my child's life just allow it to happen because what's going to happen is they're going to do exactly what I want them to do because I know they've been predestinated from before the foundation of the world they have my mind already in them their mind is already renewed and they're going to do exactly what I want them to do but sometimes we just need a little bit of a push we don't want to get fundamental the crazy about this we just want to recognize when we have that level of Faith brothers and sisters when he makes himself that real to us we can just say be it unto me according to thy will I know the situation is for your purpose Lord I know you're working it out for a purpose and we just want to see your purpose come to pass I I I'm strictly a scientist he says I know the formula of water is H2O why no man can walk on hydrogen and oxygen there's no need of me trying that well you you well you asked me something impossible then Peter never would have walked on the water imagine that he asked for something impossible so I want to say you know I talked about Peter being that person who was just a quick guide to speak imagine if he wasn't quick to speak if he maybe was a bit like me and he would just take it in and think about the situation maybe somebody else would have jumped out of the boat and gone and actually done that before he could have had opportunity to do it but God created him to be that way for a purpose and he was able to say it Lord if that's you then just then me to come unto you right sometimes we need to have that kind of faith and I would say that's childlike Faith wouldn't you that's the one that's going to say hey you know what I just believe it I'm not going to try and figure it out he said that he's the same yesterday today for everybody his stripes I am healed he took those stripes for a purpose we know that the first drops of blood that were shed they were actually there we know that it was in the garden when he laid down his will but really it wasn't at Calvary when the nails went into him is when he took the stripes for our healing that's the blood that was shed the only thing he know he never figured out how it was he just took God at his word and went walking on I just think it's so beautiful brother Branham says that's what we got to do don't try to figure it out how God's going to do these things just accept it and go on just accept it and go on tonight I just wanted to try and encourage our faith brothers and sisters that you know we can find ourselves in the circumstances and the situations with the ships and and the seas and our problems and issues and circumstances but God knows exactly where we are and I can promise you that we didn't get to where we are on accident we got to where we are so that he can express himself to us and through us he wants us to walk on that situation he doesn't want us to have to tread through it and drown in it no way we know that he will make a way of Escape through the situation for us so I want to say tonight brothers and sisters what's your need what's our need what's your Mountain we sing that song so many times what's the mountain that we have standing in front of us maybe it's not even directly in front of us it's it's 20 miles down the road but we know we've got to go through that mountain we've got to get around that mountain it's in our way I just want to say this tonight hold on hold on brothers and sisters just wait on the Lord because we know that if we wait on the Lord we'll renew our strength and we need our strength for the journey and our strength many times will turn into his strength we won't even understand it we know that the the picture that we have in the back there I believe it is when I don't know what the story is exactly who wrote it but it's the footprints and the sands of time isn't it where there's just one set of footprints there and the one man goes to heaven and he says Lord why didn't you help me and he says look there was only one set of footprints there and that set of footprints was me while I carried you didn't you recognize that so many times we think that we're doing it on our own we're making it happen on our own but that's not at all what's happening he's one the one that's carrying us he's the one that's taken us through you know they that wait upon the Lord talking about this this uh this word weight I just have to check something here bear with me I really don't like doing that um yeah it is H 6960 sometimes I confuse myself and it doesn't take very much for that to happen but uh you know this this scripture they that wait upon the Lord this word wait it made me think you know sometimes we have many times we have circumstances in our lives that just never seem to change it seems like we've got this trial and it just continually continually goes on and on and on and Satan comes around and tells us you're never going to get over it you're never going to get away from it you're never going to overcome it and you know I believe that you will I personally believe you will we don't have to actually live in a cage our entire lives but you know whether Bradham talks about that that circumstance of The Crow and how there was a farmer that found a crow and he had the crow and he tied a string around that Crow and he kept that Crow and that Crow recognized that he was tied by a string and when all his buddies would come in and they would feed together and he would fellowship with his friends of the crows and then something would happen in one two and then all of them would fly away he'd try and fly away and he couldn't get away he recognized that he was bound he was tied he couldn't get away and we know that this situation for this Crow it's such a simple story but brothers and sisters many times we can find ourselves in that circumstance where this Crow had his string around his leg but one time someone came along and they untied that string they were able to get him free and he didn't recognize that string was tied he didn't think that string was loose from his leg I mean he he felt like he was still tied that was all he knew for however long he was in those bonds he was in those Fetters he had this problem in his life he's stuck but he was truly free and you know all he had to do was try and flap his wings but he clearly came to the place where he gave up trying to fly and we know that we are eagles of this age and and I want to say just like brother Bradham said you hear that scream brothers and sisters just jump I've been thinking about it you know many times we have these circumstances these situations these problems in our lives brother Branham talked about it how he had this one thing that he went right to the end of his life and he did 1965 he talks about it on the wings of a snow white dove how he had this enemy this thing six inches long this little weasel looking thing that always badgered him and he tried to get rid of it and he could never get rid of it and what happened was there was a time there was a day appointed of the father where he told him clearly your enemy is dead and I want to tell you brothers and sisters whatever it is that's badgering you whatever it is that's holding you back whatever it is that thinks it's got a grip on your life there's coming a time appointed of the father for you and for me where we can say our enemy is dead and it doesn't have to be the end of our Lives all it takes is a full surrender her unto the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they're going to mount up with wings as the Eagles but age 6960 is kava out of the Strong's Concordance weight is to bind together perhaps to twist that is to collect to expect not just hope not just think but to expect to gather together to look patiently to tarry and to wait I just want to say brothers and sisters tarry and wait upon the Lord he will renew your strength and when he does it you will have the ability to Flap your wings and the things that used to bind you down you will recognize they no longer hold you you can break the bonds of gravity and fly and fly to a place where maybe you've never gone before and I think that that's entirely possible for us brothers and sisters but the only way it's going to happen is if we wait upon the Lord and sometimes waiting upon the Lord isn't maybe the way we think and I just want to try and encourage us this way this isn't something that we can say I'm just going to purpose in my life I'm going to have a hunger strike I'm going to go and fast and pray and I'm going to wait upon the Lord and he's going to move because when we do that brothers and sisters what we're doing is we're trying to actually frustrate Grace we're going to try and move the hand of God and we're not going to move the hand of God the only thing that we're going to do is get in line with his word he wants us to live and be contributing members of this Society he wants us to live our lives we have to live our lives we've got to be a dad if we're a father we've got to be a mother if we've had children and we're a mom we've got to be a husband we've got to be a wife we've got to be children if we're in our positions we've got to be those people I can't just say I'm not going to be a dad now I'm going to go and out to the backfield and I'm just going to go and fast and pray and everyone needs to figure out their things and I'll come back when I'm ready I don't have that luxury and and it wouldn't be right for me to do that I still need to provide a living for my family I still need to be there for my wife I still need to be there for the children I still need to be here at the pulpit I can't just disappear and say I'm just going to go and wait upon the Lord no that's not what this scripture is saying this scripture is saying wait upon the Lord in your position go to church be with your family go to work but trust God for a solution in your life and he will provide it and do chorus brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us tonight a little bit something else along the way just a little bit more about the testimony Road you know sister Tina she's in the hospital and uh I think it's just amazing I I had created this a little while ago for people might have forgotten about it and some people might not even know we have it I I thought it would be really neat to get a testimony book to get a book full of testimonies not because we're trying to get fundamental and we're going to create a book of Acts that the the the the world will read about us after we're gone I'm not going fundamentally crazy like that even though we are a little bit but I thought it would be really neat to have something significant to write testimonies in for what God has done in our lives and I know that initially uh when I did it maybe it was just the wrong time or I don't know but I felt like it wasn't really well received so I put it away and I almost forgot about it and I started thinking about sister Tina I went and saw her today and I started to really think about her and and I I remembered something that she's the first one to actually give me a testimony to put in this book and I thought my goodness what a tremendous thing so tonight I just want to take a couple minutes and I want to read a testimony of sister Tina but for those people that don't know about this book it's here for us and I really want to encourage as many people that have testimonies come and write your testimony in here what what this book is about is encouraging us to recognize that you know sometimes we can have a testimony service and we hear it and maybe we just don't remember it and life comes around and forgets we forget about things our lives are busy I want to encourage us to remember these testimonies so I thought it would be neat to just have a place that we could we could we could write these these testimonies in and I I I got brother Mervin to write in here for me I had some words that I wanted to put in here for everyone that reads this just so we recognize what this is about and it says this book is dedicated to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ period it's my intention to encourage the faith of each person who reads the acts of the holy spirit in these testimonies because it's not the acts of Our Lives it's not the acts of the ministry it's not the acts of the Prophet it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in our lives it says these are real in account and current from our generation may God richly bless you now I know there's some significant testimonies out there I mean real good ones and I I would be thrilled if people want to add to this so the first testimony in here is from October 2nd 2019. God bless you Saints I would like to thank the Lord for his healing power once again in my life before the past week I wake up on Wednesday morning with a sore throat I went to see the doctor but I was given to returning the following day but in the night from Wednesday to Thursday I could not sleep I was coughing a lot and have strong fever in the morning I started having seizures I stretched myself on the ground so I do not fall any hour and hurt myself I was alone and needed help I was very weak but in the morning I have enough strength to walk up and have help call 911 and ended in the hospital I thank you for your prayers God has proved again his faithfulness to me says thank you sister Tina when we were talking to her today I said how many times how many times has God proved himself to you how many times you've been in the hospital like this and she said seven times today was the seventh time and I said seven is a perfect number sister seven is a perfect number in 2021 November actually it was July 11th in 2021 sister Tina this was our very first service after kovid sister Tina another testimony Shalom to all the saints thank God for being back among you may God bless each of you who have expressed your love in one way or another sister Tina I want to say tonight brothers and sisters our sister China is sitting in the Foothills Hospital standing on the word of God saying the doctor is trying to give me a solution where I can wear a backpack it's actually a pack with a control thing there's stuff inside it and what it does is it will control what's going on in her heart rate it will pump the electricity to her heart and and they'll take the pacemaker out of her heart and and she'll have to wear this either a backpack a strap just like a purse she'll have a purse with her wherever she goes or a backpack situation this is what the doctors are saying and and it's the only solution for her and she's there in the hospital saying nope don't want it I'm not interested I'm interested in the Lord Jesus Christ moving in my life that's the second testimony from sister Tina here we have the third testimony from sister Tina she's not afraid to give a testimony of what the Lord's doing for her in her life and I just want to encourage every one of us tonight to not only have prayer here as we close the service for our dear sister but to remember her in prayer when we go home do not forget about her when we pray for our food tomorrow for breakfast when we have lunch and when we have supper and the next day and just trust that the Lord's will will be done in Sister Tina's life maybe I'll call the musicians as I read this she says Shalom people of God I would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity he gives me to be with you again today I just think it's beautiful we can stop right there she knows the importance of what it means to be in service she knows what it means to be able to be there because she can understand what it means when she wants to be there but can't be I spend a month and a half in the hospital heart failure the diagnosis was very bad dramatic I was on the verge of death but despite the seriousness of the situation I clung to the promises of God brothers and sisters she's doing that very thing right now tonight the very same scenario reminding him what he said about me mine a list of what God Said was necessary for me so that each time when I was in too much pain or doubt or medical team with his report I had to remind God what he said I say God you said Daddy you said again and again that way I could hold on I would like to thank all of you who have prayed for me or showed your kindness to me even a lovely family here send some money to me may God richly bless them also sister Joy sisters Sharon's mom from Edmonton may God bless her a nice sister a woman of faith she called me to encourage me every day and you know she said those words today as well she's called her to encourage her every day now I'm getting better and better every day I can say now God you did it God bless you all praise the Lord sister Tina sorry for the poor English another testimony three of them from sister Tina I just started thinking about it today why I know that she's got some written testimonies what a tremendous thing it is to give God the glory maybe stand with me tonight as we close brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us when we're in the storm when we're in the boat don't be afraid to walk on the water don't be afraid to walk on the situation just walk forwards walk to Jesus Look Away to Jesus don't look at the storm don't look at the waves don't look at the wind just look away to Jesus because he is the one that knew you would be right there so he could come to you in your situation let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you that you are the same yesterday today and forever and even tonight father while we have the circumstances while we have the situations you want to express yourself to us father you want to express yourself to us through our situations and Lord how would we ever know if we didn't have circumstances how would we ever know if we didn't have situations Lord I've said it so many times about Abraham taking his promised son Isaac to the top of the mountain and the word of God says now I know that you love me but we know father it was only so that Abraham could know that you love him and father I think so many times in our lives we have these circumstances we have these situations it's not so they can destroy us so that we can know how much you love us and father I pray tonight that you would just help us Lord to rise on the wings of Faith Lord Jesus to take a hold of the promise of this hour that you are the same yesterday today and forever you're not a dirty old grandpa that's just often some other dimension busy doing a puzzle somewhere you are The Great I Am that created this universe you called us before the foundation of the world from your very side Lord Jesus to be expressed in this age to be the ones to be able to say Amen to the word for our day Lord Jesus we just thank you for that Revelation to recognize who we are and father we pray that as we go forwards Lord in our circumstances in our situations that we would just have the ability to stand father knowing that you're in control to not want to sit down and and be afraid and ring our hands but Lord Jesus to lift our hands to lift those feeble hands up to heaven and say praise the Lord thank you Father for redeeming me thank you for shedding your blood for my Redemption Lord oh Father not so that I could be saved but so that I could love you father Lord Jesus what a tremendous thing it is to be able to love you father tonight we just want to unite together as a body of Believers for our dear sister Tina Lord we know that this is the seventh time that you've called her to this position Lord where she's dealing with a physician team that's trying to give her a Doctrine Lord that's contrary to your word and father we know that she is standing upon your word Lord she is saying I'm willing to stand in the midst of these waves in the midst of this storm I'm going to climb down under this ship and I don't care if I sink I'm going to sink trusting you father we pray that you would just Reach Out And Touch our dear sister father according to her Faith Lord what a tremendous thing it is to see a believer in this age father oh Lord I pray that I would have that kind of faith if I was in that situation Lord father we pray that you would strengthen and encourage sister Tina father we pray that she could just be a strength and encouragement to her family Lord to her daughters Lord to her grandchildren father to her entire family Lord that they would look to her and say that is a true Christian father I just pray that Lord tonight you would just go with us as we go our separate ways father that maybe we would just have a little bit of encouragement Lord maybe we would have a little bit more Faith Lord Jesus than we realized we had before we came in and father we just pray that Lord somehow someway the testimonies in our lives would stir up to the surface Lord and we would just have to express them Father and Lord that it would be an encouragement to somebody else who might read it father Lord that it wouldn't be something that we're trying to put on by ourselves Lord but Lord we're trying to just remember the goodness of you in our lives father we just love you and we thank you and we pray that you would just continue to keep your hand upon each one of us father those who are streaming tonight father those who are present those who maybe aren't doing either father that are just busy with their lives maybe they're traveling father keep your hand upon each one we ask and Lord If It Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday Lord to hear from you once again we will be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory father we just pray that even right now you would Grant a fresh coal off the altar oh Father and place it upon
