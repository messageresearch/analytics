be okay so just to know that I'm very surprised to see this turnout in church today Hallelujah it shows how much we love the Lord um and those that are not able to be here I know it's in their heart to be here um and we know that the presence of the Lord will be with them in their homes as well just before we start with the word I want us to sing a song Come and D am good friend of mine from Nigeria likes to sing this song before preaches because he said growing up he used to like food a lot and whenever they sang the song he reminds him of food but we're we're grateful to L to the Lord that we're not here to just eat natural food we're here to eat spiritual food and even if you don't have a big appetite for natural food you should have a big appetite for spiritual food so we're here

musicians thank you very much this is some something I sometimes forget and I I paid up myself because as a musician I should never forget to thank the musicians I don't feel good when the minister doesn't thank us just to be honest so it's I shouldn't forget I want us to read from Romans chapter 4 this morning and we'll also read from Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 4 will start from verse 17 and we'll read to the end of that chapter and then Romans 8 we'll read the very famous part of that chapter I think all of it is actually famous and speaks to us but we read 38 and 39 if I could please have some more monitor that'll be good thank you Romans 4 from verse 17 Paul speaking here says as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations talking about Abraham before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as do the were amen who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's whoop is stagered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God Amen and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform amen that's where I'm going to take my title from this morning just I'll continue to read but my title this morning will be that um just the state M saying I am fully persuaded my title this morning I am fully persuaded and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone pay attention to that that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead he was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification let's just quickly flip over to chapter 8 from verse 38 to 39 Paul's speaking here it said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no principalities no powers no things present nor things to comeu nor height nor depth nor any other creature anything that's created At All by God by man shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lordu let's pray this morning Heavenly Father this is the most important part of the service amen it's not because the other parts were not important but that was the preparation for this time the time lord when we want to hear directly from you yes amen anytime we'll come here Lord Jesus our desire is to hear directly from you thank you Lord amen and Lord we want to ask you to take total control now Lord take this unworthy leaps and just speak to the needs of your people yes amen amen the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the Heart Lord it wouldn't feel good if your people came with burdens and they have to go back with those burdens you know what those burdens are I don't know them Lord but you know them yes amen they're here Lord Jesus Christ father for you to take all those burdens from them Lord to to to to soo the pain there Lord Jesus to find solutions to their problems to comfort their hearts Lord and all of that can only be done by you can only be done by your word may you speak to your people this morning yes amen remember our brothers Lord Jesus Christ in leth Bridge including our pastor we just pray that you do the same there Lord Lord as our fathers of old we say the Lord watch between me and thee saying that may the Lord go with you as he will go with me so that when we meet again we can testify of What the Lord Has Done amen let that be Lord Jesus our testimony when our brothers will return with thir testimonies of what you've done in Lethbridge at the end of the service may we look back and say God has been with us has spoken to us and has met our every need in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen you may have your seat so just still very much in the mood of the New Year how many of us enjoyed the service last week that our pastor took you know the word of God is given not only for admonition it's also given for rebuke for reprove for correction and I've always thought that anytime that the Lord brings correction God is extending his mercy and it I think it was a good start to the year for God to clean us up make us get our house in order amen so that he can send down the blessings am so this morning you know I was thinking about what to bring and this message um was what the Lord L in my heart I brought it in Lethbridge on the last day of 2023 and I just felt in press in my heart to bring it again because this title that I've taken this morning is what I am coming into 2024 with an assurance that I am fully persuaded you know we think about the fact that God um said to us in the scripture I think I said that when I was praying um last week you know when we were going to take the offering that God said to us you know by by the the psalmist that said teach us to number our days you know we we count years we count months we count weeks it's God's design from the beginning God already put you know the the the the stars in there the moon in there the the the sun in there for a purpose and that purpose is so that it will be for for for seasons and for years and God expects us that as we count those years we are not just counting for fun God expects us that we apply our hearts to wisdom and as as we turn into a new year is an opportunity to look back and say what has God done in the past year but more importantly what is God ready to do in this new year now in looking at what God has done in the past year you know that song says count your blessings name them one by one many times we think about the counting but we forget about the naming of those blessings because when God gives you a blessing then there is a purpose why God is bringing that blessing God brings that blessing to encourage you to be able to trust him for what he's going to do in the future you know so God wants us to count the blessings but also to name those blessings how do you name your blessings you reflect on what God has done you look at an experience that you've had and you say to the devil that with this experience God has proven to me that what God cannot do does not exist God takes you through a trial you come out of that trial and God shows you by that blessing that I am the Lord your God that Health all your diseases so God expects us to count our blessings and name our blessings to record them I remember Pastor talking about you know the testimony book we all guilty we know that I don't know how many of us have written in that book but the pastor wanted it to be a book of remembrance and even if you don't get a chance to write it there find a way to record what God has done in your life amen hallelujah and memories are not always sharp but sometimes you know it's good enough even if you haven't written it down to think about what God has done to help you to know that God is able to do more in the future you know the very reason why we have the scriptures the Bible said this thing Things are Written for our examples so we can have a reference point so we can go back and say if God did this for Abraham then God can do it for me and that's what I'm bringing this morning you know this morning I'm not my regular comfort zone of teaching I probably won't be there this morning I'll probably be doing a bit of preaching this morning so bear with me if I go too fast and uh if I'm going too fast just slow me down a little bit uh the deacons can do that or anybody so we're taking the title this morning of I am fully persuaded and Paul was giving an account of Abraham that Abraham was fully persuaded that the promise that God made God was able to bring it to pass now being persuaded means to be convinced being persuaded means to be certain being persuaded means to be satisfied being persuaded means to be worn over being persuaded mean to be sold I'm sold on that idea I'm sold on what he has told me being persuaded means to be inclined toward something so the story of Abraham goes this way he was living in the land where God um has taken his forefathers After the flood I believe he came from my kids can correct me if I'm wrong but I think I think he came from the lineage of jaff is that correct pus it was sham okay okay thank you we went through it at home recently and his forefathers had migrated because they started to multiply After the flood but there were no more serving God and then God decided to call a single man out and this is what God did God said come out of your father's land come out of your Kindra and I will take you to a land now if I tell you come follow me what's the next question where are we going and if I tell you nowhere are you going to follow me you're going to think twice you know where I come from especially if a stranger you don't follow a stranger right but Abraham must have understood that this person that was speaking to him was someone that was greater than just anybody it was someone he could trust it was someone he could put his confidence in and the Bible said that the things that God said to him regardless of the current situation and Circumstance Abraham believed God regardless of the situation of the circumstance now when God started to speak to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 let's just take a look at some of the things that God said to him and let's look at how impossible those things were God called Abraham he said now get thee out of thy country from thy Kindra and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation who was he talking to a man that had no child a man whose wife was Barren he didn't say I will make of thee many children he said I will make of thee a great nation he said and I will bless thee and make thy name great a man that no one knew anything about and thou shallal be a blessed that means it was going to be a source of blessing now what did he say again and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee wow shall all the families of the earth be blessed all the families of the earth and the Bible I told us that Abraham departed but when Abraham decided to go he did not fully follow the instruction of God God told him to depart and take what belongs to him now Abraham went as with his father and with with his nephew those were not not technically people that belonged to him were not part of his household but Abraham did that just in in in the kindness of his heart you know my nephew you know is fatherless my brother has died I don't want to leave him alone and he started to go with him and as he went they got to a place where now the first thing that happened was Abraham backed so he he he went with lot and his father his father died on the trip and then when Abraham got to a place which the Bible you know made us to realize that that was also part of the land of Canaan there was famine in the land and Abraham went to Egypt now God knows how to make us take a walk with him you know brother Paul kichi that very first message you preached has never left me a walk with God Abraham walked with God when you talk about taking a walk with someone it is Progressive when you talk about taking a walk with someone there are lined marks there are M Stones as you continue to go and that is the exact same way God has called us when God called you there were certain promises that God made to you as an individual amen there are promises we can look at in the Bible it might look generic but until that promise becomes personal to you then it's not yours now when God makes that promise and it becomes personal to to you there are chances that that promise looks as if it will never come to pass but what is God looking for God is looking for Faith but many times when we talk about Abraham Abraham told us that the account of Abraham in Hebrews chapter 11 showed Abraham as a perfect person because Paul said that he did not starer as a promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving thanks that was the account but if you go back and read what happened we have many instances where Abraham staggered what does that mean when you taking your walk with God you'll make mistakes but there's a Redemption that has happened that makes God not to count your mistakes and regardless of how many times Satan brings those mistakes in front of you and tell you you've made those mistakes ask ask ask Satan whose account are we going to believe amen now let's let me show you some of the mistakes that Abraham made the very first thing he did he was in the land where God said he should go to and there was famine on the land and the first thing Abraham did was to Backle but Abraham said going to Egypt is a backsliding condition now that was the first thing he did he went into a place where God said don't be there that was different from where God wanted him to be and when he got to Egypt just like it happens to us because when you take the first wrong step you're actually on your way to taking many many more wrong steps right because why you've changed direction if you're going on a straight line and you decide to just take an inch of an angle and just take a turn the farther you go the farther away you are from the path that you were on before so Abraham got to Egypt and then he looked at his 65 year-old wife who was still very pretty and the Egyptians were going to look at her and you know take her away from him and he said you know what sari we're going to a place where they don't fear God we're going to a place where I know that when they see you they know you're pretty you're 65 but you still look pretty they might want to take you away from me so here is the deal when they ask about our relationship tell them that you're my sister so he went from backsliding moving away from where God wanted him to be and he found himself telling a lie now God knows how to make things work out for good what what was what was one of the promises that God made to Abraham God said he was going to bless Abraham right Abraham did not have a thinge there was no record of Abraham being a rich man before he left where he was his father's house but when he got to Egypt and we know the story Pharaoh was told about sah Pharaoh decided to take her wanted her to become another wife and then God went and spoke to Pharaoh like you're a dead man why why are you taking someone else's wife and like a asked the question how did God speak to Pharaoh should we do a quiz but what I said to them is though Pharaoh was not serving the Living God they all had a way of communicating with divinity with the Divine one and it could have been through their um magicians or whatever they would have come to say there's something wrong in the palace you've taken what does not belong to you and maybe they will cast lot they will do all the magician stuff and then the information will come to say that this woman that you took must be someone's wife so God had a way of revealing himself to them although they did not not serve God that's my understanding now Pharaoh said to to to to Abraham why did you do this why were you going to put me in this bad spot why were you going to make me get destroyed for no reason and then Abraham said well I was afraid now God started to fulfill using that oh God is so awesome even in his backs sading condition God started to bring the promise to pass the Bible told us that Abraham was blessed by Pharaoh let me read it and Pharaoh commanded as men concerning him sorry [Music] um okay yeah um and Abraham went up out of Egypt this is Genesis 13 he and his wife and all that he had lot with him and Abraham was very rich in cattle in silver and in Gold there must have been a place where um yeah I think I and the princess of pharaoh this is sorry verse 12 now sorry chapter 12:1 15 the princess also of pharaoh saw her and commanded her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and he treated Abraham well for her sake so when he took his wife away from him thinking that that was a sister he started to treat Abraham well and he had sheep he blessed Abraham he brought blessings upon Abraham and Abraham had sheep and oxen and Hees and Men servants and Maid servants and shees and camels now what was God doing God started to bring his promise of blessing to pass even in the backing condition that Abraham was what does that tell me you know the song writer said and I always love this line in that old belev song He said your Shepherds elected the path you must tray what does that mean even when you are in sin it is not outside of the plan of God is it outside of the will of God yes God doesn't want us to be in sin but it's not outside of his plan because it's so he all working together for good why will Paul say that for we know that all things you know God knows how to Blindside the devil Satan is thinking is trying to put you in trouble but God is using that trouble to bring down a potential blessing why the purpose of God cannot be defeated thank do you believe that this morning are you fully persuaded this morning oh we are coming into a year that has a lot of uncertainties the American election is happening this year my daughter was asking Alexa how old is Joe Biden Alexa said he's 81 years old is fril are we going to have a woman president in America we don't know brother J was praying and telling us what's going on in Israel and we know that this thing some of those things cannot happen when we are still here there's a lot of uncertain the economies of the world they are crashing America is getting to a state where she has to go back to Rome and ask for gold so the lot of uncertainties that we should expect will happen but in the midst of all these uncertainties this is the time to be certain of God this is the time to know that your Shepherd selected the path you must tread regardless of what happens God has you taken care of some things might happen it might look as see oh the world is about to end but remember there's nothing you're going through that God did not intend to happen oh wonderful I was thinking about it this morning we are only actors in God's play now when the when did God design that play when did he write it out it was before the foundation of the world now when God did the planning those of us that work in project management and all of those stuff even those that have businesses planning is always something that's important but when you do your own planning you have to do a lot of reviews you plan you take it back you review you come back you do some analysis you come back you you review that plan you get it to a point you are implementing the plan you're you're you're still rebuilding it as as anyone ever heard the term you know building a plane whilst you're flying it but that's because we humans but when God wrote that plan in the beginning he didn't have to review it now many times we think about the plan of God and it looks like something that is far removed but however one thing you must know is that you are a little bitty piece of that plan you are a little Bey piece of that plan it's just like a like pebbles on the beach you know the ter terminology you're not the only Pebble on the beach is to make you feel like you're small but is in God's Own maybe not small maybe just to keep you humble just to remember that you're not the only one that can do what you do right right but all those Pebbles on the beach in God's own economy God identifies them God recognizes them they are all important they are so important that without them God's plan cannot be complete have you ever thought of yourself as that way that without you God's plan cannot be complete so regardless of what happens regardless of how you look at yourself you are so important to God that God cannot lose you that's why Jesus Christ said he said all that the father has given me they are what they are their mine he said no man can pluck them out of my hands Hallelujah he said why the father that gave them to me he is mightier than all so don't look at yourself as a small person don't look at yourself as someone that's not important I was thinking about it oh my goodness if Jesus Christ were to come in flesh today and he's in the City of Calgary and Jesus wanted to go to church guess where Jesus will come to he will come to the midst of the bright amen it will come it's not because others are not important but Jesus is the word and the word always attracts Jesus what happened when Jesus was 12 years old I don't know why I'm verying off but it's for somebody Jesus was 12 years old Joseph Mary's mother Jesus the rest of the family they went to Jerusalem to observe the normal custom of feast and it was time for them to go and they forgot about Jesus many times they forget about Jesus and they started joury and I believe they journeyed for three days before they looked in their company like oh we thought he was with a cousin is not with you oh the other cousin asked them is Jesus there no oh no way we must have we must have left him and they traveled back but where did they find Jesus they found Jesus with the word amen so if you want to find Jesus today if you want to know where Jesus will be Jesus will always be where the word is back to our story how am I doing with time my goodness Abraham and lot got to a point you know Abraham returned back to the land of Canaan where God you know wanted him to be initially after he left Egypt now he returned with blessing amen he started to transfer that blessing part of that blessing over to his nephew to lot they started to increase now they increased to a state where it was impossible for them to cohabit because the herzman of lot and the Hersman of Abraham started fighting we don't know exactly what we're fighting over it could be like oh no that well is supposed to be for us you know we have not F that camels and you're talking about feeding your camels there was a conflict that happened now something else I was stting to think about this morning I've not done enough study but I felt it was also part of the Walk that Abraham was having with God and if we look at second Peter chapter 1 and brother BR preed that message the statue of a perfect B brother Abraham told us that how to build the house that God lives in is those virtues he also made us to understand that it is a walk with God it's a process of becoming someone that gets to the stature of a perfect man and brother B will also explain that perfect in the sense of how it was used in the Bible was not sinless it was perfect in terms of completion now God taught Abraham Faith from the very first time God called him because he only took faith if God had told Abraham where he was going he would not need faith if I say go come go with me and say where are we going like we're going downtown oh downtown I've been there before let's go he wouldn't take Faith it wasn't require it wouldn't require Faith but God did not tell him where he was going God gave him promises that he couldn't bring to pass but he was persuaded enough to know that this God that made the promise he can fulfill it that was Faith now God brought him to a place of trial and what was God trying to do trying to see his brotherly kindness that's all the way up that's why I said I'm not done the study oh probably can fix you know the gaps in between but at this time God was teaching Abraham brotherly kindness now who was the promise given to was it lot or was given to Abraham it was given to Abraham and Abraham got to that point where he had to Humble himself Abraham was the older one was supposed to make the choice first but he said to lot he said you look at the land it's before us you choose where you want to go now there's so many lessons here and I just want to quickly point out the lesson that we can also take from lot lot looked by sight he looked at the plains he found the areas that were green that had good vegetation for their animals and when he left the Bible said he pitched his tent towards Sodom he did not go into Sodom he pitched his tent towards Sodom he went very close to sin but never really got into sin but fast forward to the time after this after that se oparation had happened that where he was we were told in the Bible that there was a fight between some Kings and lot and his family were taken captive when the Bible was giving us that record the Bible told us that lot was in Sodom so initially was close to Sodom but he gradually moved closer until he found himself in Sodom we're not going to the details of what but we know what Sodom is we know how the men and the women of Sodom brought God to a level of disgust that God couldn't contain it anymore that he had to destroy sudom so God taught Abraham brotherly kindness from the first time he had to make that choice and from the other time he had to go rescue now at the time when Abraham finally separated himself from every unbeliever the Bram said God came and reaffirm the promise so as we keep going we found that that God changed that promise from just a promise to a covenant amen hallelujah if it was just a promise it was it was okay God will still fulfill it but David said what is man that you even consider am but God wanted to take it from just a promise to a state where just as we humans will make our promises to each other and you say oh you promis this no I want you to sign the document we want a contract God said I'm going to do it the way you do it as humans I'm going to make it Covenant so God said to Abraham take an eeper 3year old take a she goat 3year old take a ram 3-year-old take a young pigeon and take a was the last one tole do sorry back to our our living room it's it's it's interesting because we're going through this study as well at home and it's interesting to to to be to be you know remembering some of those things we were talking about now God told him like those first three the hea the sheot and the ram said when you kill them divide them but don't do the same to the the birds now but BR explained to us that in their time the way they made covenants is that they will WR it on the sheet of paper they will tear it into two one takes this the other takes that then they will bring an animal kill the animal divide it into two what are they saying if if I fill my part of the promise let me be like this animalall now the thing about this Covenant that God made it was an unconditional Covenant there were other covenants that God made the Mosaic Covenant when God made it it was based on you know you do this it was based on the law if you do this this is if you go to Deuteronomy you will see what Moses said if you do do this God will bless you if you do that God will curse you but right before even that happened because we are not connected to the Mosaic Covenant we are connected to the abrahamic Covenant before God will ever bring the law God already gave us an unconditional Covenant brother said that God did not base it on what man can do because every time that God tried to make a covenant with man man failed amen he knows our fry he knows we are humans he knows we can't keep our promises remember that song remind me dear Lord I know I am human and humans forget and God made that Covenant upon the basis of him being able to fulfill it Abraham had nothing to do and God said if I don't fulfill this Covenant let me be like this hea that's been killed and divided into two let me be like this Ram that's been killed and divided to you let me be like this she goat can God die no God cannot die that's right and that was not enough God gave a sign Hallelujah he said I've giving you the Covenant you know I will not fail the Bible said by two immutable things in which he was impossible for God to lie Hallelujah by two IM mutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation that's right those of us that have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope Hallelujah that set before us so what was that sign it was a sign of circumcision why is it important to say this brother brah said somebody came and said to him that you know Abraham believed God and he was imputed unto him for righteousness what more can you do than to believe God Abraham said that's correct but that was not enough because the person that was saying Abraham believed God and he was imputed felt that once you believe because there was a Doctrine at the time that when you believe you have received the Holy Ghost but brother Braham said that he didn't just do that God did something else he gave a sign of circumcision that sign was to separate those that had the Covenant from those that did not have the Covenant if you have the Covenant what God wants you to do to prove you have the Covenant is to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is why it is important that is why brother Braham preached the message token and said this is the highlight of my Ministry amen you must receive the token that is the sign of the Covenant let me quickly read brother BR to you faith of Abraham paragraph 16 it say said now the reason I chose Abraham because that was the promise made to Abraham we all know that God made covenants with man and man always breaks his Covenant with God so in the case of Abraham God made the Covenant with himself and Abraham unconditionally you know he said to Adam in the adamic Covenant if you will not do this and if you'll do that you know he said if you the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die it was it was it was based on a condition right he said Adam turned right around and broke it but in Abraham it wasn't if you do anything it is I have done hallelujah it's already a past tense Abraham had nothing to do with it it was God that did it you have nothing to do with it it is God that did it the reason why you are here this morning is that something pulled you I was praying in the room I said Lord your people are coming on a day that's cold like this I said maybe there are some of them that are only here because their parents said they should come but they still came there might be some people that are here because they're thinking oh if I don't come someone's going to call me why didn't you come to church but they still came there's something that you used to set the condition right for them to be in church and those that are not here that are streaming as well there was a desire in their heart to switch on their device rise and stream and hear the word of God so that shows me that God is pulling something inside of you there's a pool that is responding to a pool there is a deep that is responding to a deep God is making you know that I've got something for you you come receive it it has nothing to do what what with what you can do we cannot draw ourselves to him he the one that draws himself to us when he draws himself to us he does the work what is rest seasoning from your own Works Hallelujah but said but in Abraham it wasn't if you do anything it's I have done it's already a past tense Abraham had nothing to do with it it was God that did it and now I want you to notice this three nights as we go through it wasn't only to Abraham but it was to Abraham's seed amen remember it didn't say seeds it said seed as in singular amen and our hair according to the promise sorry I read it wrong it was to Abraham's seed Abraham's children the Covenant was made to Abraham and his children abrah said well you say that will be Jews no we've been in Christ we take on Abraham's seed because Christ was that seed and here with him according to the promise we are Abraham's seed if we are dead in Christ we become Abraham's seed and at her according to the promise therefore that every person that's been born again of the Holy Spirit truly born not just thought they were born right not went through some emotion not went through some sensation but was truly borned they could have all the emotion sensation with it but you could have the sensation and emotion and not be born you can have the emotion and The Sensation and be born but you could also have the emotion and The Sensation and not be born so what is most important is the birth itself regardless of how it happens but Abraham said every breath is a mess for some they're quiet when the mess is happening for others wow you know when you were in the in the hospital and the babies have been delivered some babies would just cry and that's all some sorry did I scream sorry the monitors are not laughing loud enough I'm sorry if I startled anyone but the question is is the Baby Alive did the birth happen and that's whatam is saying here you could have all the sensation and the emotion and not be born but those who are borned of the spirit of God are Abraham's seed Not seeds but seed the promised seed for it's true Christ which was the son of Abraham if you can get a hold of this said then if we are Abraham's seed we've got to have the faith of Abraham a lion gives birth to a lion if we are the Seed of Abraham we have got to have the attribute of Abraham what was the attribute of Abraham the faith of Abraham to believe God for something that was impossible brothers and sisters take a moment and think of something you think is impossible sister Amber you might look impossible for your children to be saved but if that's your promise it's yours make up your mind that in 2024 you are holding on to that promise amen anyone that's in that situation hold on to that promise the same way Abraham did tell the devil I am a Seed of Abraham I have the attribute of Abraham when Abraham was in a situation like mine the reaction of Abraham was that he believed God he counted him that promise faithful oh blessed be the name of the Lord if we are Abraham's seed we've got to have the faith of Abraham and the Bible said he was like God hallelujah Abraham was not just having that Faith because it wasn't just his faith the Bible told us that is it was the faith of God that God put in Abraham and if we are SE of Abraham if we are children of Abraham if we are children of God God has put that same faith in us all we need to do is to recognize it and put it into action amen you love the Lord this morning the Bible said he was like God God that he called those things which were not as though they were because God said so hallah now when God was deciding to make you his child you were not there a story that we all know was about the natural son of Abraham Isaac when his wife reaka could not have children for a long time he turned to God and prayed and God answered his prayer and Rebecca became pregnant with two boys and the Bible made us to know that before those children were born before they will ever do any evil or good God came to to Rebecca and said Rebecca you've got two nations in your womb and they always fighting against each other now the two are fighting against each other there's one of them that I love and the other one I hate Paul said is there unrighteousness in God but by God's forn knowledge by God seeing the future right from the beginning he saw those ones that were his seed he saw those ones that will be partakers of the divine nature and whenever you are becoming a partaker of the divine nature showing God's attribute it brings more love of God to you and it's the opposite when someone is displaying the attribute of Satan God hates the person you said that's a strong word but that's what God said that's right Romans 9:11 for the children be not yet born neither having done any good or evil oh I love this that the purpose of God according to election might stand amen now brothers and sisters you are a purpose of God am I don't think you heard me you are a purpose of God what what makes us doubt that is because our imagination is limited said to when we were born and when we die brother brah will preach somewhere when he started talking about you know predestination he said let's take a trip to before anything was ever formed and let's take a tribute to the mind of God and let's start to think about what was in the mind of God and he said God have attributes and those attributes that God had are you and and me meaning that years I don't know millions and trillions of years scientists would tell us about millions of years I don't know if they can ever count you know what was before before the beginning right but said Genesis one said in the beginning was the the beginning God made the heavens and the Earth and he said we don't know how long that took just said foot stop amen hallelujah and they started talking about this Earth was without form brother brah said there was a wall that existed before and then God destroyed it and made the world that we are living in now but what I want you to know that you're a purpose of God Amen and God elected you and that election can never change there is no way you are going to be in trouble and remember that you are a purpose of God and still be sad there is no way you're are going to have dismay and remember that you were in the plan of God and still feel dejected there is no way you are going to have a need and then remember that you are God's child and still start crying why because you know your father is the one that that does what amen what what what what did David say sorry I'm being on my unlike myself today but I hope it's okay David said he has the cattle on a thousand hills I think someone tried to do the math it didn't say on one Hill cattle on a thousand hills many times we think that being a message believer means you will always be in need we can't have Rich message Believers you can't ask God for money that is natural I beg to defer I beg to differ because when God said he was going to bless Abraham God did not limit it to spiritual blessing God blessed Abraham with physical blessing as well how will the work of God progress if everyone in the church is poor how will the work of God progress but God decides to bless you so that you can bring that that bless oh I don't have that scripture but Paul was saying to the rich he said the reason why God blessed you is so you can bless others amen so that if there are needs we can be instruments in the hands of God we can be providers we can step into that attribute of God that attribute that is called Jehovah jir hallah and though is my brother that is given me that need I know that I have prayed for it I know I've trusted God for it and I know it was God that put it in my in the heart of my brother to give that need to me why why because it's Jehovah amen but theam said anytime that God wants to act he uses man anytime Satan wants to act he uses man if God ever descent here we cannot stand the presence of God but that's why God always hidees himself behind a man a badger skin to make it easy for us to be able to touch God he said god with skin on it remember that story God will skin on it so you're an attribute of God you are here for a purpose you are here to fulfill a purpose the sooner you understand that the more you find yourself doing exactly what God wants you to do the more everything you do in your life when you go to work when you are with your family all the callings of your life you will not see it I'm just I'm just you w't see it like I'm just I'm just following regular routine right brother Joel might be taking photos but that's the Holy Spirit taking photos Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen oh wonderful brother Paul you renovating houses but that's God coming in the flesh to do that am when he does it you will see Perfection amen maybe the client is not happy and when they're going to call you they're going to think that you're going to you know start to defend yourself and you say to them no worries we'll fix it like which man could do that let's talk about the son of prosperity his name was Joseph life was hard for him at the start he wasn't the one that brought the dreams to himself God gave him dreams and the only thing the small boy could do was just to tell his dreams dreams to his parents and to his siblings and they hated him for it it was not in his power to bring the dreams to pass the only thing is those Brothers they felt threatened because they also knew that he was a faithful guy he was a righteous guy it will always tell on them when they did what was wrong and that made them to hit him the more now when God God was going to fulfill that plan it was not a Bed of Roses God knows how to take us through the Crooked pathway that's right I've said this a few times but you know that the Bible said actually told us that God is the Alpha and the Omega he said is nothing in between what that means is that when God sees it God is only looking at the end God is not moved by what happens in between because he is fully persuaded that the promise I made will come to pass amen so God is not moved by all that happens and Joseph went from being sold as a slave to strangers to becoming you know a a a slave in the house of somebody that served pharaoh to be lied upon to being told that you know you you you you you you you did something that his imagination could not take you know sometimes when someone is accused of something that they could potentially do it doesn't feel that bad you say oh I didn't do it I didn't do it this time kids you remember when you took the chocolate right you know I wasn't the one that took CH you did it cuz you did it the last time no but I didn't do it you did it and then you look oh Dad Dad accused me of something I didn't do but you could potentially have done it but think about something that you could never have done and someone accuses you of it think about the hurt that Joseph felt and Not only was he accused of it he had to face the punishment it's reading in the news the other day some men that were you know went to prison and uh they've been in prison for 40 something years I guess 75 year old man and now the judge says oh I'm sorry you actually never did it that was Injustice where does he start from he's lost perhaps 40 years or more of his life for something he never did so that's how Joseph felt but as Joseph was in that prison the calling of God upon his life could not hide the purpose of God in his life could not hide that gift that God had given him could not be hidden if you plant a lily but made us to understand it's got to come through a lot before he can come out but there's a power that is pushing it through all the struggles that power is pushing it where is the power pushing him towards he pushing him towards the promise he pushing it towards the purpose of his life amen when we in high school baby Elementary School we did an experiment I don't know if the kids still do it but you take a box dark box put a plant in it no actually put you know um a pot in it a small pot your plant maybe corner or something in it and then you make a little opening somewhere for lights to come in now by Nature that seed that is inside the soil is looking for light for it to grow and you realize that as it starts to grow it starts to point towards where that light is coming from and that is the same thing that that that that happens in the life of a Believer the light which is the word of God is your compass is what you're growing towards is what you are responding to amen so Joseph was responding to that promise and though it took a long time God brought that promise to pass remember that when he was in the prison and those two servants of pharaoh the Porter and the baker had their dreams and came to him and he told them the the meaning of their dreams and then they went down and he kept thinking why will the porter forget me why will he forget me it's been two years he hasn't remembered but if he had remembered ear earlier Joseph would have become the prince because Pharaoh wouldn't have had the dream at that time because the vision is yet for an appointed time the vision is yet for an appointed time he said but at the end hallelujah oh is there something that you have laid before the Lord and it looks like it's lingering there's that job that he said Lord this is the type of job I want looks like my career is taunted looks like I'm not getting the growth I want this is what it is you've applied and applied and applied and applied and is all rejections I want to tell you this morning the vision is for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak amen and not lie amen he said though it t to man it is taring to man it looks like you're waiting to man it looks like it's it's it's it's supposed to have happened why hasn't it happened he said wait for it amen wait for it don't wait in complain continue to wait in Praise continue to thank the Lord whatever you looking for you're looking for children God is able to give it to you Hallelujah you know for Abraham when God finally was going to bring that promise of Isaac to pass God visited him a year before and said to him according to the time of life Sarah will bring forth the child and his name will be Isaac you can imagine Abraham and Sarah when they were buying the things for the baby they had a name on it put the name Isaac on it because we know that that baby is coming amen the one that made the promise he is faithful amen you can already start to buy your baby things and put the name you desire on those things start to make God know that you are in Preparation to receive the promise that he has made to you the vision is for an appointed time but it will surely come am it will not h we talk about amrah and joked we don't have all the time let's talk about a man that faced the greatest trial in the Bible job he was a man that the Bible said he was righteous you couldn't lay any charge to him he had seven sons and three daughters and because he was a rich man the richest man in the eastern part of the world at that time his sons had money and they will throw parties at their homes and his daughters will attend probably his daughters stayed with him in his house but his sons all had their own houses and he didn't know what was going on but he wanted to keep his house spotless as much as possible and he knew at that time that Jehovah had a remedy for sin if anyone had committed sin the way to come and get forgiveness of sin is to kill an animal and regardless of whether he could confirm it or not job will always do a sacrifice perform a sacrifice after they had their get togethers and God was proud of him but one day the accuser of the Brethren also came with the sons of God before God and God likes to brag about his children have you ever had that had that feeling when you do something right that the holy spirit is just pleased with you that the Holy Spirit just feels like bragging about you that the Holy Spirit just likes the way you responded to that person when they said something very wrong to you and maybe your husband or your wife oh you have to be honest it happens all the time I always say that that virtue of patience get into marriage and then you will go through the process of being being brought into that maturity level of patience I know I'm not the same as I was 12 years ago when we just got married so job God started to brag about him to the devil and the devil said to God the only reason why job is serving you is because of the riches now God knew that job wasn't serving him because of the riches it was God's choice to bless job God wanted to have a John Charis God wanted to have a Cosmos magika on the earth at that time that will have enough money and will be a representation and an example and a curse to those that will have their money and not serve God so that on the day of judgment when someone will say Lord the reason I did not serve you is because you blessed me with money God will say John charot come CU M come were you a billionaire on Earth yes I was and you still preach on the streets the streets of Lagos yes I did and God will say look at that man that's my son he had all the riches he could mess his life up he could do whatever whatever he wanted to do but he decided to serve me so God had job on Earth as a testimony of a rich man that will not deny God that will use his rich is for God Amen and God said well if you don't believe me it's not hard I'll take away the riches you go take away the riches but don't touch him that's right and the worst Calamity that could ever happen to a human being happened to job in one day but what was job's response job said the the lord giveth am the lord taketh away job recognized the source of his riches some people have money but they think the source is their hard work you ever hear people talk about oh I've worked so hard that's the only reason I'm here I made this business work brother Justice and sister Sharon was showing us a video yesterday of a guy that was being interviewed from just a situation that happened he made $16 million and they were asking him do you have an advice for young people how to make money he said no let your Source be God if I will paraphrase let your Source be God like is there any other trick any other way no just you just keep your relationship with God know where your source is if your source is God then you will know that whether those riches remain or they don't the god that gave the riches is able to replenish again how many people commit suicide because their business is filled a lot of people but when you know that it's from God if God takes it away you have to know that there's a purpose for it and the god that took it away he's able to bring it back am so the devil convinced you know made God to say you know you can take his riches away and then the next day Satan came again God said well you took his riches away he's still serving me said well you know when a man is well well well in his body he's always fine but you let me touch his health and he will curse you to your face now as this conversation was going on job was not aware of it right right God did not explain to job what that happened brother BR preached he didn't it wasn't recorded but it told us that he preed job and the hash ape for six weeks and a sister came and said when are you going to take job off of the harsh AP said when the Holy Spirit leads me to but I never understood how it'll take brother Braham six weeks to preach about job on the asip until I recently took another study of the Book of Job right amen and this time sorry if you don't agree with me but this time I listened to it in the NLT version just to be able to hear it in an English that is closer to the English we speak today this day and age to make me appreciate the agony of job the first thing that job had to deal with is that when his friends came after his misery he had I don't know what I I try to Google it like does science even know what disease he had because he had balls over his body there were pores coming out he couldn't even sit on on a wooden bench or anything he had to pile up Ashes to sit on to be comfortable just a little bit and the Bible said when his friends came and saw him in that condition no one could speak for seven days imagine going to see someone that you knew a rich man in a hospital bed and they just a shadow of themselves they couldn't speak for seven days and job started to speak to express his mind which we're going to quickly go into but I want to to just look at quickly I want us to quickly look at what responses this man that needed Comfort what sort of responses did he get from his friends pardon me I'll be reading from the analy version the first friend elifa said will you be patient and let me say a word for who could keep from speaking out in the past you have encouraged many people you have strengthened those who were weak your words have supported those who were Fallen you you encourage those with shaking EAS but now when troubl strikes you lose heart you're terrified when he touches you doesn't your reverence for God give you confidence doesn't your life of Integrity give you hope stop and think do the innocent die when have the upright been destroyed my experience shows that those who plant trouble and cultivate evil will harvest the same a breath from God destroy them the vanish in the blast of his anger imagine a friend that's supposed to bring comforting words saying this to job bead said how long will you go on like this you sound like a blustering wind does God twist Justice does the almighty twist what is Right Said your children must have sinned against him didn't he offer the sacrifice he did even if they had sinned he offered sacrifice he brought them under the blood says so their punishment was well deserved well if you pray to God and seek the favor of the almighty and if you're pure and live with Integrity it will surely rise up and restore your happy home and though you started with little you will end with much the third friend over said shouldn't someone answer this torrent of words is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking should I remain silent while you Babble on when you mock God shouldn't someone make you ashamed you claim my beliefs are pure and I am clean on the sight of God if only God will speak if only he will tell you what it thinks if only he will tell you the secrets of wisdom for True wisdom is not a simple matter listen God is doubtless punishing you for less than you deserve a righteous man job could not explain the situation he was in he couldn't also explain why God would be silent he concluded that God was angry with him and he was entirely confused and even more so very depressed he said if the misery if my misery could be weighed and my troubles put on scales they will outweigh all the Sands of the sea so that is why I spoke impulsively for the almighty has struck me down with his arrows their poisons infect my spirit God's Terrors are lined up against me don't I have a right to complain don't wild donkeys Pray when they find no grass and oxen Belo when they have no food don't people complain about unsalted food Brothers don't do that she might forget to put the salt sometimes just get a bit of it and add yourself doesn't anyone want the tastelessness sorry does anyone want the tastelessness tasteless white of an egg my appetite disappears when I look at it I gag at the thought of eating oh that I might have my request that God will grant my desire I wish he will crush me I wish he will reach out his hand and kill me at least I can take comfort in this despite the pain I have not denied the words of the Holy One but I do not have the strength to endure I have nothing to live for he went on to say I'm disgusted with my life let me complain freely my bitter Soul must complain I will say to God don't simply condemn me tell me the charge you are bringing against me what do you gain by oppressing me why do you reject me the work of your own hands while smiling on the schemes of the wicked are your eyes like those of a human do you see things only as people see them is your lifetime only as long as hours is your life so short that you must quickly probe for my guilt and search for my sin although you know I'm not guilty no one can Rescue Me from your hands you formed me with your hands you made me yet now you completely destroy me remember that you made me from dust will you turn me back to dust so soon you guided my conception and formed me in the womb you clothed me with skin and flesh and you knit my bones and sin together you gave me life and showed me your unfailing love my life was preserved by your care yet your your real motive your true intent was to watch me and if I sinned you will not forgive my guilt if I am guilty too bad for me and even if I'm innocent I can't hold my head high because I'm filled with shame and misery and if I hold my head high you hunt me like a lion and display your awesome power against me again and again you witness against me you pour out your growing anger on me and bring fresh armies against me why then why why did you deliver me from my mother's womb why did you let me die at Birth it will be as though as I had never existed going directly from the womb to the Grave I have only a few days left so leave me alone that I may have a moment of comfort before I leave never to return for the land of darkness and autog GL this is how he felt but that was God testing job why did I bring this regardless of your trials or testings that you may go through none of us can ever come near where job went through none of us but he said somewhere he said when you have tried me I shall come forth as gold but Abraham said job being the Prophet The Spirit come on him and he stood up on his feet and shook himself the spirit on him the prophet now finding the will of God and standing up he said I know my redeemer leaveth and at the last days he will stand upon this Earth though the schem WMS destroy this body yet in my flesh yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes shall be old and not another Abraham said that's right the prophet s the coming of the Lord I know my redeemer leaveth lives now continually Forever My Redeemer leaveth it's continual amen it will stand on the earth do the schem ons destroy my body said like he did the flower down there and so for yet in my flesh I'll see God who I shall see for myself my eyes Shall Behold and not another I'll call the musicians now ver 10 minutes to 12 I know it's cold I know we're tired the cold makes you tired I was out yesterday came back home and I felt like I'd done a full day of work well thank you for being attentive thank you for not sleeping too much brothers and sisters we all should decide that in this year as we go forward we will only listen to God we'll be persuaded that the promise he has made is able to bring it to pass the Braham said in the message believing God and that's where I got the inspiration for this message if you were wondering he said when I put that Tabernacle on the corner and kneel in here on a pile of gypsum weed and old horse weeds here and this right over this Pulpit this morning when he was upon God said I will bless it maybe there's something small that you're starting maybe there's something that God has laid in your heart that you've not even started and God has said I will bless it maybe you've brought some prayer CH before God a desire you have for a loved one and God said I will bless it the Braham said here stood the false prophet up and said I seen automobiles moving in and out and I see the stones going one from another so as God told the Braham that he was going to bless the Braham Tabernacle at the time when he was starting to build it when it was just weeds when it was just a swarm God said I'll bless it but right after that false prophet started to arise it might not be actual false prophets it might be the devil messing with your mind telling you that it's not going to happen listen to the prophet of God said that was 20 years ago and today it's still sailing on and it will Sail on because it was built here upon sweat and tears of prayer and promise of God it shall Prevail Abraham said Upon This Rock I'll build my church the gates of hell wouldn't Prevail against it said there you are yes sir don't pay no attention to what they say don't pay no attention to what people say anyone that tells you anything different from what God has told you shut your ears to what they say Amen if Satan is telling you something different than what God has told you shut your ears to it amen said I've learned my Lessing of listening to people who don't know what they're talking about I listen to one person that's almighty God Amen Jesus said from hence forth you ask in my name ask the father in my name and you'll get it brother Braham says I believe it amen let's be on our feet are you persuaded this morning fully persuaded that he that made the promise is able to bring it to pass are there are some promises that he made that you forgot about because it wasn't coming to pass you had waited and waited and waited and you think it will never happen again the vision is for a appointed time said though it hry it shall not hry wait for it give it time give it time there's a season there's a time appointed God has taught me that over the past year past couple years times to get anous about things just even very little things I remember we had planted some on meal grass in the summer before just actually fall of 2022 and I was really really waiting for them to grow and Bloom and bluem but we had planted too late in the year for that to happen and I took it to God In Prayer like Lord I because I like when it's summertime I really like when spring in summer I really like the lawn to look really beautiful put a lot of hard work to it people ask me why I do that that I said well I studied to be a farmer as my first degree so don't blame me it's also I'll just confess sometimes gets me away from the family sometimes and I can have my own time just to be honest when men do gardening trust me there's something more but I was like this is not growing and God said give it time amen the following spring it outperformed my expectation am I was asking for it at a time that it was not due according to Nature it wasn't the time according to God's plan it wasn't the time I was only worried for no reason but God's time is always the best time so if there's anything the Lord has promised you if there's anything you've laid before the Lord do it hurry it will not hry amen stay fully persuaded that he that made the promise is able to bring it to pass remind him every morning say Lord this might have taken time but I'm fully persuaded if you did it for Abraham and I am a Seed of Abraham and I have the same faith of Abraham brother Abraham said if somebody receiv received something from God on a certain basis he said God will be impartial amen not to give it to someone else on the same basis that is the god that we serve let's go to into this year so continuing into the year I can't believe it's already half of the month of January but let's go into this year without full Assurance it was the one that taught us to number our days for one reason we might apply our hearts to wisdom we can measure our growth we can see where we were before and ask ourselves am I getting better like our Pastor said if there's any growth to Aspire to is our Christian growth am what was I last year little ones the Lord still gives the baptism of the Holy Ghost if he did not happen last year you pray you desire it you trust the Lord for it when you receive the Holy Ghost it takes it takes a lot of worries away from you and from your parents brother Bram said that when you are sealed it is until the day of your Redemption so parents when we see our children receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are not going to get worried about they going Wayward in the future we are not going to get about sorry worry about them leaving church because that this has now become their own personal revelation so as we are praying as we trusting God for them sometimes they do the things that pains us and we wonder how the devil you know got got a chance to get into our homes and get our children to do this nasty things but let's keep believing the promise amen he gave us those children we we dedicated each and every one of them to God when they were babies we gave them over to him amen hallelujah and he said anyone that the father gives to me they are mine I will not lose them let's bow our heads this morning our dear father you visited us today yes it has nothing to do Lord with a vessel it is the pulling and the prayers of your people and your desire your love your mercy that you have shown to your people to meet the needs that are represented here maybe you've got personal in some ways that has nothing to do with man's idea that is you just been caring to speak directly to the needs of your people your word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart as we pray prayed Lord Jesus at the start of this service if your people will brace this freezing conditions to come to church with burdens with needs Lord it will be inappropriate for them to go back with those burdens We Trust Lord Jesus as your people have yielded Lord to hear from you today you have taken away the burdens you've taken away the pains Lord Jesus you've given us more Assurance than we could ever have that you are always with us that we can go Lord Jesus with more Assurance with more much more persuasion with much more inclination that God is always with us that he that made the promise it will bring it to pass I command your blessings upon your children Lord I am nothing Lord but I'm reminded Lord Jesus that in the Old Testament when the people come for the service at the close of the service the priest Will Bless the people not me Lord Jesus Will perhaps the gift you placed in my life upon the basis of the commission of the Holy Spirit I command your blessings upon your people if there's anything Lord Jesus that they have laid before you Lord Jesus any aspirations any desires Lord any matter they have committed into your hands may you meet them at the point of their needs may you bless the work of the hands of your people Lord may you multiply the works of their hands Lord anything they lay their hands upon according to your word may it prosper and flourish am may you Lord Jesus raise men and women that will be good ambassadors of your kingdom to all levels and Strat of life and living that the unbelievers on the day of judgment will not have an excuse that people will not be able to say Lord I didn't serve you because I was rich I didn't serve you because things w well for me I didn't serve you because I was in this condition or I was even leaving in the City of Calgary where people don't want to hear the name God called may we be witnesses that can stand on the day of judgment and say we were in the very same condition as those people but Grace spoke for us Grace kept us Grace helped us we lived for God lord Jesus reminded Lord of that Short age where the the Bible said Lord Jesus they were leaving where Satan's seat was and yet they were righteous we know Lord we are leaving right where Satan's seat is but we claim ourselves and our children for you we say there Lord our generation will serve the Lord our children's generation will serve the Lord we will be Witnesses of this end time message we will not just witness with our mouth we will witness with our lives and Lord you be proud of us as you were of job your blessings will be Upon Our Lives as it was with Joseph will be truly the Seed of Abraham having the faith of Abraham which is the faith of God our brothers who have travel to let preach Lord may you Lord be with them as they return back home may you watch over them Lord we trust that you've also been a blessing Lord Jesus Christ father through the gift of our brother mvin Lord Jesus to that little group there father we pray there Lord Jesus that you continue the work that you're doing there to the place where you have intended it to be and the glory and the honor and the praise will be thine for in Jesus Christ's name we pray am

so interesting I find brother Toby addressing the young ones about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm thinking God is faithful God is true this is what we've been we we we've been talking about even today like the things we're talking about about the natural baptism has a purpose and that is it leads us to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then once you get there that seals it and so I've just talking to each one and we were talking about the purpose for which we went into the in for baptism has that been fulfilled and if not what is stopping it so so it's it's just so beautiful our Lord is so good brother you see if God gives birth to you or if if any parent here you know you did not decide where your child should be born h no you decided where your child your child did not decide it you decided where your child will sleep what they'll wear their name what they eat everything you decided and sometimes it may not be comfortable for your child but it's your decision and this is what we are going through they may be disappointments they may be pain they may be sorrow they may be heartaches but that is the choice God God has made for us the thing is he's faithful and he'll see see us to the end so let's glorify him let's let's do that little bit because you see problems gives us that unique opportunity to offer that sacrifice of praise it's easy for us all to thank him when all is well but when there is pain when there is sorrow when there are heartaches when there are disappointments and we still don't look at our feelings but the word and say glory be to to his name that is the unique thing that he's looking from us let's stay faithful because he is faithful amen let's bow down our heart before him Lord you are faithful you are true and we love you and we adore [Music] you the choices you make for us may not always be comfortable but we know it's for our good we thank you oh God for giving us that faith in that your word that unfailing word that
