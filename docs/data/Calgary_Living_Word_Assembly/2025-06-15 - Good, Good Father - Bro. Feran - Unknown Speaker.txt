[Music] Psalm 103 says, "Like as a father pityth his children, the Lord pityth them that fear him." But even the best of fathers, even the best, those of us that like to say we are good fathers, you know, we have imperfections, but there's one one father that's perfect. He's our good, good father. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers today. Um, it's not easy to be a father, right? We didn't um sing um compose a song for the fathers today, but we're going to sing another song. The mothers are always more important. Um, but we will just sing this. You know the song. Please sing with me. [Music] Oh, have heard a thousand stories of what they think you'll like. But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night. Can you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone? You're a good good father. It's who you are. It's who you are. It's who you are. And I'm loved by you. It's who I am. It's who I am. It's who I am. [Music] Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide. But I know we're all searching for answers. Only you proide us. You know just what we need before we can say the world. You're a good good father. It's who you are. Join me singer. It's who you are. It's who you are. And I'm loved by you. It's who I am. It's who I am. It's who I am. Cuz you're perfect in all of your ways. You're perfect in all of your ways. You're perfect in all of your ways to us. Oh, you are perfect in all of your ways. You're perfect in all of your ways. You're perfect in all of your ways to us. Love so highable. It's a love so uniable. I hard at least speak so unexplainable. I I cannot think as you call me. Deeper still as you call me. Deeper still as you call me. Deeper still into love. Love. You're a good father. It's who you are. It's who you are. It's who you are. And I'm loved by you. It's who I am. It's who I am. It's who I am. You're a good father. It's who you are. It's who you are. It's who you are.
