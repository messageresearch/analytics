[43:40] pergami and church
[43:44] age Revelations chapter 2 verse

[44:06] in pergamus write these things saith he
[44:09] which hath the sharp sword with two
[44:11] edges I Know Thy works and where and
[44:15] where thou
[44:16] dwellest even where Satan's seed is and
[44:19] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[44:22] denied my faith even in those days where
[44:26] an antipast was my faithful martyr who
[44:30] was slain among you where Satan dwelleth
[44:33] but I have a few things against thee
[44:35] because thou Hast there them that hold
[44:38] the doctrine of balum who taught baac to
[44:41] cast a stumbling block before the
[44:43] children of Israel to eat things
[44:46] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[44:49] fornication so hast thou also them that
[44:53] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[44:57] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[45:00] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[45:03] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[45:07] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[45:09] saith unto the churches to him that
[45:12] overcometh will I give to eat of the

[45:27] one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus

[45:37] anyone that doesn't have an ear to hear
[45:39] what your spirit saith that Lord you
[45:41] would just give them an ear and father
[45:43] we know that your Prophet said that
[45:46] sometimes people don't have the ability
[45:48] to hear only because a devil has tied
[45:52] that nerve and tonight Lord Jesus we
[45:56] pray that if anyone has that nerve Tied
[45:58] by a devil we just pray in the name of
[46:01] Jesus Christ that you would loose that
[46:03] nerve that we could rebuke that devil in
[46:06] the name of Jesus Christ that father we

[49:39] home just want to carry on in our study
[49:42] here with the exposition of the seven
[49:43] Church ages I will announce you on the
[49:45] weekend as well brother so I hope it's
[49:47] okay there's people that are away that
[49:50] uh definitely need to hear and I'm sure
[49:51] they will uh through the streaming but
[49:53] uh it's just a little bit better in
[49:54] person
[49:56] you know uh talking about the exposition
[49:58] of the seven Church ages and uh dealing
[50:01] with the pergami and church age there's
[50:04] just so much in here that we have talked
[50:06] about in the past I'm not going to go
[50:08] too far back tonight but brother Bram he
[50:10] talks about the different portions of
[50:12] the scripture in in the message to the
[50:14] pergami and church age and you know we
[50:17] last week we talked about how Christ
[50:19] eulogizes the church and the eulogy is
[50:21] like the last word the description of
[50:24] this church age and how this church age
[50:27] was dying and the reason is because they
[50:30] had those that held to the doctrine of
[50:32] balum and and that was to to look at the
[50:35] hinder parts of the people to cause them
[50:36] to fall to stumble throw stumbling
[50:38] blocks in front of people the the next
[50:41] one is that we know that they had uh
[50:44] they they held to the doctrine of the
[50:47] nians which is what we're going to talk
[50:49] about tonight in uh in a great way it's
[50:52] actually quite technical the way brother
[50:54] bradam gets into it but it's it's so
[50:56] important to know that the doctrine of
[50:59] the nicians is to conquer the the
[51:03] congregation the the the the the
[51:07] ministry to to do something to actually
[51:09] hold down the the Believers and that's
[51:12] so opposite of what the prophet in our
[51:14] day taught what the Lord brought to us
[51:16] and that is to bring everyone to know
[51:19] that that they are truly the Sons and
[51:22] Daughters of God and I don't have the
[51:23] quote tonight but brother Bram said it I
[51:25] did not come to actually create a church
[51:28] I did not come to create a following I
[51:31] came to encourage people to recognize
[51:34] that they are the PowerHouse of the Holy
[51:37] Ghost amen that they're the ones that
[51:40] have the power I think it's just such a
[51:42] beautiful thing he goes on to talk about
[51:44] thou holdest fast my name thou Hast not
[51:47] denied my faith and that's really where
[51:50] I want to get into I'm going to pick up
[51:51] from paragraph 101 thou Hast not denied
[51:54] my faith and and I think if we had to
[51:57] title it tonight which I don't really
[51:58] want to I just want to continue on with
[52:00] the the numerical um titles but uh thou
[52:04] Hast not denied my faith it's not my
[52:07] faith it's not Calgary living word's
[52:09] Faith it's not the Deacon's Faith it's
[52:12] not anybody's Faith it's not even
[52:13] brother bram's Faith brothers and
[52:15] sisters that's right it's the faith of
[52:18] God it's not the faith in God it's the
[52:21] faith of God and that's what brother bam
[52:23] talks about here this is where it gets
[52:25] really good I I just think it's it's so
[52:26] beautiful thou Hast not denied my faith
[52:29] that was the group of people in this
[52:31] church age they did not deny his faith
[52:35] and they were able to stand they were
[52:37] able to be where Satan is at and brother
[52:40] bam talks about it here it's so
[52:41] beautiful what what they did was they
[52:43] spoiled Satan's Dominion they spoiled
[52:46] Satan's garden and I just couldn't help
[52:48] but think when we were when I was
[52:49] studying this how that's exactly what's
[52:51] going on right now and that's why he's
[52:53] roaring that's why he's going around
[52:55] causing so many problems cuz he knows
[52:57] his time is short but as long as Grace
[52:59] is still on the earth here as long as
[53:00] the Bride of Jesus Christ is still here
[53:03] he's got a little bit of time so he is
[53:05] working over time to come up with
[53:07] distractions and we talked about it on
[53:09] Sunday maybe it's the music maybe it's
[53:11] the temperature maybe it's this maybe
[53:12] it's that maybe it's the other thing
[53:14] anything to keep us distracted from
[53:16] coming to the realization of who we
[53:18] really are we really are the
[53:21] manifestation of the word for our age
[53:23] for our day but thou Hast not denied my
[53:26] faith paragraph
[53:28] 101 in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked
[53:32] how the mighty Miracle had taken place
[53:34] upon the crippled one at the gate
[53:36] beautiful he explained it on this wise
[53:39] and his jesus' name through faith in his
[53:44] Jesus name hath made this man former
[53:47] strong yay the faith which is by
[53:52] from him Jesus hath given him the the
[53:56] man this perfect soundness in the
[53:59] presence of you
[54:02] all how many people have been
[54:05] spiritually crippled but have been given
[54:07] spiritual soundness am why see there it
[54:12] is Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought
[54:17] about the
[54:19] miracle Peter didn't say stand up and
[54:23] walk in the name of the father and of
[54:25] the son and of the Holy ghost he didn't
[54:28] do that Peter did not claim it was his
[54:31] own human Faith anymore than he claimed
[54:33] that it was his own
[54:36] name but here in this age sometimes
[54:39] people maybe they didn't claim that it
[54:42] was in their name and maybe sometimes we
[54:44] see Ministry that don't claim that it's
[54:47] in their name but people want to get
[54:49] people to Ministry where they see the
[54:51] gifts manifest don't they and what
[54:54] happens is if that person doesn't
[54:56] actually knock that down and say it's
[54:59] not me it's not my Ministry it's
[55:02] Christ's Ministry don't try and put me
[55:05] in that position because if you do that
[55:07] God will knock me down so that you won't
[55:10] look at me right it's got to be Jesus
[55:14] Christ amen jesus' name and Jesus Faith
[55:18] brought about the miracle Peter did not
[55:20] claim it was in his own human Faith
[55:22] anymore than he claimed that it was his
[55:24] in in that it was his own name he said
[55:28] that jesus' name used in the faith which
[55:32] is from Jesus performed that great work
[55:35] this faith is what the Lord was speaking
[55:38] about in Revelations
[55:40] 2:13 it was his Capital
[55:44] H faith it was not faith in him but it
[55:49] was his own faith that he had given to
[55:51] the
[55:53] Believers and brothers and sisters
[55:55] that's where we need to be tonight
[55:57] amen don't look at your own faith I mean
[56:00] sometimes when we're children we grow we
[56:02] toddle we fall we we need to grow and
[56:05] mature we we need to go through things
[56:07] in our lives we don't come out of the
[56:09] womb as an adult we have to grow and the
[56:12] same thing is spiritually spiritually we
[56:14] need to grow and we need to mature we
[56:16] need to learn we need to be able to make
[56:18] mistakes we need room to make mistakes
[56:21] and to correct them amen but when we do
[56:24] receive the correction do we do that's
[56:27] the proof of who we are and the more
[56:29] mature we get the more willing we're
[56:31] going to be able to receive correction
[56:33] and the more we receive correction the
[56:35] more we grow the more we have the
[56:37] ability to do that but when we have
[56:39] pride in the way and we say no no no no
[56:41] no I'm good I don't have any room for
[56:44] correction in my life I know the message
[56:45] of the hour he can't help us and you
[56:48] know what I'll say is it's not his faith
[56:51] that's in us when we're that way because
[56:53] his faith will always go back to the
[56:55] word his faith will always align up with
[56:57] the word amen but when we have his faith
[57:00] it's the next level it's not us
[57:03] anymore according as God hath dwelt to
[57:06] every man according to verse one the men
[57:09] are
[57:10] Brethren The Measure of Faith that's
[57:12] Romans
[57:13] 123b the second half of that verse in
[57:16] Ephesians 2:8 by grace are you saved
[57:19] through faith and that faith not of
[57:23] yourselves it wasn't earned it was the
[57:26] gift of God it wasn't something that was
[57:29] given to us from tenure because we've
[57:31] been in the message for 40 years or 30
[57:33] years or 20 years it's because God gave
[57:36] it to us because we were given that gift
[57:40] James 2 verse1 and it also says in James
[57:43] 2:1 my brethren notice he too is talking
[57:46] to Brethren have not the faith of not in
[57:51] our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory
[57:53] with the respect of persons
[57:56] no we're not going to make a a special
[58:00] place for the special people we're going
[58:01] to Simply say that we're all Brothers
[58:03] and Sisters in Christ Jesus brothers and
[58:05] sisters of like Precious Faith yes the
[58:07] ones that know the Christ they they've
[58:10] had a relationship with him personally
[58:12] yes amen and you know I I threw this in
[58:14] last week I'm going to bring it again 1
[58:16] Peter 1 ver8 whom have not seen ye love
[58:21] in whom though now ye see him not yet
[58:25] believing ye you rejoice with joy
[58:27] unspeakable and full of Glory receiving
[58:30] the end of your faith amen there is a
[58:34] Time brothers and sisters where we
[58:35] receive the end of our faith and that's
[58:38] where it becomes the next level that's
[58:41] where we shift out of the the last gear
[58:43] that we were in into the next gear where
[58:45] we can say I can't rationally see it I I
[58:48] don't understand it humanly speaking how
[58:51] this is going to turn out right how this
[58:53] situation is going to happen I cannot
[58:55] ask
[58:56] 1+ 2 and get three that's not going to
[58:59] happen in this situation I have to just
[59:02] set aside all of my rational thinking
[59:05] and trust in the Lord with all of my
[59:07] heart and lean not into my own
[59:09] understanding but in all of my ways
[59:11] including this one that I can't fix on
[59:13] my own acknowledge him because he will
[59:16] direct my path then but receiving the
[59:18] end of our faith even the salvation of
[59:20] our souls amen many times we can say I'm
[59:23] saved I know I'm saved but don't know
[59:26] about the situation brother bradam says
[59:28] we need to know about that situation we
[59:30] need to be able to claim that situation
[59:32] whatever it is whether it's our healing
[59:33] whether it's our finances whether it's
[59:35] our marriage whether it's our children
[59:37] Whatever It Is by faith we need to be
[59:39] able to claim that and say it is even
[59:43] though Naturally Speaking we can look at
[59:45] it and say oh it isn't no it isn't no
[59:48] it's not naturally speaking it's not and
[59:51] many times it's not naturally speaking
[59:53] but that's exactly where the devil likes
[59:56] to get us and and make us Shake in our
[59:59] faith and when it's our faith we will
[1:00:01] shake but when it's his faith brother
[1:00:03] bam talks about it the shoulders go back
[1:00:05] and the chest comes out and he says no
[1:00:08] shut up when the devil starts saying no
[1:00:11] it can't turn out right it's not going
[1:00:12] to work God doesn't hear your prayers
[1:00:15] his faith says shut up I don't need to
[1:00:17] listen to that because the word of God
[1:00:19] says that yes indeed he he he will heal
[1:00:21] my body yes indeed he will seal my soul
[1:00:25] yes indeed we will raise up again at the
[1:00:27] end we don't have to be afraid of
[1:00:30] death but it's it's our
[1:00:32] faith the ending of our faith receiving
[1:00:35] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:00:37] of your souls of which salvation the
[1:00:38] prophets have inquired and searched
[1:00:40] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[1:00:42] that should come unto you and me thank
[1:00:46] you Lord you know I just took a look at
[1:00:48] this word end there's there's there's a
[1:00:50] lot in there that I'd like to really
[1:00:51] examine but I just thought the end what
[1:00:53] is the end receiving the end of our
[1:00:55] faith what is the end of our faith well
[1:00:58] in uh in
[1:01:01] uh uh strongs concordance Telos
[1:01:09] g556 is uh Telos and it says to set out
[1:01:13] for a definite point or goal the end of
[1:01:17] our faith receiving the end of our faith
[1:01:20] properly the point aimed at as a limit
[1:01:24] there's going to be a limit to how far
[1:01:26] our faith will bring us just like
[1:01:28] children they need their parents to be
[1:01:31] the Holy Ghost for them because they
[1:01:33] don't receive the Holy Ghost right away
[1:01:35] they need to grow they need to mature
[1:01:37] they need to be taught in the way they
[1:01:38] should go raised up in the way trained
[1:01:40] up in the way they should go so that the
[1:01:42] word won't depart from them but in the
[1:01:43] meantime someone has to be there as
[1:01:46] their covering somebody needs to be in
[1:01:48] standing in the gap for them but there
[1:01:51] comes a point in time where they reach
[1:01:53] that point of accountability and when
[1:01:55] they reach that point accountability now
[1:01:56] the parents have to take their hands off
[1:01:58] and say they're on their own it's up to
[1:02:01] the Lord to actually lead them now amen
[1:02:04] but when they're trained up in the way
[1:02:05] they should go they will understand what
[1:02:07] that means and that's why we need to
[1:02:10] make sure that we're teaching properly
[1:02:12] but there comes a point where there's a
[1:02:14] limit there's a point where the end goal
[1:02:17] happens and and it goes on to say here
[1:02:20] on this Telos
[1:02:22] g556 the conclusion of an act or a state
[1:02:27] termination literally or
[1:02:30] figuratively of
[1:02:33] indefinitely the result immediate
[1:02:35] ultimate or prophetic
[1:02:39] purpose excuse me
[1:02:41] especially an impost or Levy as paid I
[1:02:46] just think that's beautiful the the end
[1:02:47] of our faith it's been paid for
[1:02:50] continual custom
[1:02:53] end our faith can be a continual custom
[1:02:57] we spoke a little bit about that on
[1:02:58] Sunday our faith but there comes a point
[1:03:01] where there's a goal where there's going
[1:03:03] to be an ending of our faith when it's
[1:03:06] his faith that comes into our lives
[1:03:08] especially an impost or Levy as paid
[1:03:11] continual custom
[1:03:13] and finally and uttermost I I just
[1:03:16] thought that was so good one word the
[1:03:19] word end has has such a big definition
[1:03:22] in the Hebrew text and and it's just
[1:03:25] wonderful thing to look at it sometimes
[1:03:27] in a little bit of a different way just
[1:03:28] expound upon one thing there's coming a
[1:03:30] Time brothers and sisters where we have
[1:03:32] to receive the end of our faith and when
[1:03:34] we receive the end of our faith then it
[1:03:36] takes us to the next level it gives us
[1:03:37] the ability to just trust in the Lord
[1:03:39] and and if you've ever done it you
[1:03:41] understand exactly what I'm talking
[1:03:43] about where you just can't see how the
[1:03:44] two ends are going to come together it's
[1:03:46] just not going to going to work out but
[1:03:48] somehow some way it does that's God and
[1:03:52] that's the exactly what he wants that's
[1:03:54] the way he wants it to be for us in our
[1:03:56] lives so that we're trusting him
[1:03:59] paragraph 102 in this pergan age where
[1:04:02] men were humanizing
[1:04:05] salvation humanizing
[1:04:08] salvation and remember brother Bram says
[1:04:10] that each and every age carries over
[1:04:13] into the next age this isn't necessarily
[1:04:15] just about the pergan church age this
[1:04:17] can be about the leodan age this can be
[1:04:19] about how in The Message Church age
[1:04:22] people are humanizing salvation and
[1:04:26] saying that if it doesn't happen a
[1:04:27] certain way which not necessarily lines
[1:04:30] up with the word of God then it's not
[1:04:32] the right way make sure it lines up with
[1:04:34] the word of
[1:04:35] God it has to am in the pergam in this
[1:04:39] peramine age where men were humanizing
[1:04:41] salvation having turned from the truth
[1:04:44] that salvation is of the Lord and having
[1:04:48] cast aside the doctrine of election and
[1:04:51] open wide the church door and their
[1:04:54] Fellowship to any and all who subscribed
[1:04:58] to their tenants never mind the word
[1:05:01] remember one word off brothers and
[1:05:03] sisters does all that one word off opens
[1:05:07] that door wide just like we just read in
[1:05:09] this age of Rapid de degradation there
[1:05:12] were still a few who had the measure of
[1:05:16] that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:05:19] not only used that faith in Acts of
[1:05:22] power but withstood those who dared to
[1:05:25] say that they were saved simply on the
[1:05:28] grounds of joining a
[1:05:30] church I just love this this this is it
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:36] here paragraph 103 they knew that no man
[1:05:39] could truly believe unto eternal life
[1:05:41] and the righteousness of God apart from
[1:05:43] the measure of the faith of the Lord
[1:05:48] Jesus himself that personal relationship
[1:05:51] that new birth that we heard about how
[1:05:55] she actually goes on to know him
[1:05:57] personally amen and then there's a new
[1:06:00] birth it's a relationship as today's
[1:06:03] church is filled with mental Believers I
[1:06:06] say Lord help us amen don't be a mental
[1:06:09] believer don't don't be a traditional
[1:06:11] believer who Endor the Virgin birth the
[1:06:15] shed blood going to church and taking
[1:06:17] communion and are not reborn at
[1:06:21] all even so in that third age was the
[1:06:24] same problem human Faith wasn't enough
[1:06:27] then and it is not enough
[1:06:31] now we can't just have an understanding
[1:06:34] we can't just have a mental conception
[1:06:36] of this it has to be revealed by the
[1:06:38] Holy Ghost amen and how's that going to
[1:06:41] happen outside of receiving the Holy
[1:06:43] Ghost it takes the very faith of the Son
[1:06:46] of God to drop into a man's heart so
[1:06:50] that he can receive the Lord Of Glory
[1:06:53] into the temple not made with hands amen
[1:06:57] it's not about joining a church it's not
[1:07:00] about tenure in a church it's not about
[1:07:04] a family tradition there's no such thing
[1:07:06] as the prophet taught about Apostolic
[1:07:09] succession God doesn't have
[1:07:10] grandchildren we can't say because Mom
[1:07:13] and Dad serve God and they have a mighty
[1:07:15] God in their life that I'm saved and I
[1:07:17] don't have to come the same way they did
[1:07:20] every one of us has to be
[1:07:22] repent die out to ourselves be baptized
[1:07:25] ized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:27] Christ for the remission of our sins and
[1:07:30] then what happens we just read it here
[1:07:32] receive the Lord Of Glory not some
[1:07:35] inanimate Spirit that's called the holy
[1:07:37] ghost or the Holy Spirit that's put out
[1:07:39] there as one of the three persons it's
[1:07:42] himself the Lord Of Glory into the
[1:07:45] temple not made with hands boy that gets
[1:07:48] me going I love that this was a living
[1:07:52] faith I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:07:56] God Paul did not say that he lived by
[1:07:58] the faith in the Son of God it was the
[1:08:01] faith of the Son of God that had given
[1:08:04] him life and kept him living in
[1:08:07] Christian Victory and that's no
[1:08:09] different for every one of us we've got
[1:08:11] to keep living in that same Faith amen
[1:08:14] it has to be that exact same Faith
[1:08:17] living out through us no they had not
[1:08:20] denied that salvation was Supernatural
[1:08:22] from start to finish they kept alive the
[1:08:24] truth of his name and his faith and they
[1:08:27] were blessed by the Lord and accounted
[1:08:30] worthy of
[1:08:31] him this next paragraph here is
[1:08:33] interesting I haven't studied it out in
[1:08:36] in great detail and I don't know how
[1:08:38] much there is on it but antip pass my
[1:08:41] faithful martyr brother bam he says
[1:08:43] there's no other record in the word or
[1:08:45] in any profane history concerning this
[1:08:48] brother but surely there need not be it
[1:08:52] is more than enough that he was forn and
[1:08:55] and known of the Lord amen it is more
[1:08:59] than enough to see his faithfulness unto
[1:09:01] the Lord recorded in the Living Word he
[1:09:04] was a Christian he had the name of
[1:09:07] Jesus he had the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ and he was amongst those who
[1:09:12] lived by it now I could be wrong here
[1:09:15] but this just conjures up the thought
[1:09:17] even of how the word will actually just
[1:09:20] mention a a quick blurb about an
[1:09:22] individual and it just made me think
[1:09:24] about that one there was a prostitute
[1:09:26] that understood that that they called
[1:09:28] Jesus to that Feast over at Simon's
[1:09:30] house and and they called him and said
[1:09:32] you know let's see a a mighty sign or a
[1:09:34] Wonder let's have a a dinnertime show
[1:09:37] with this Jesus this this this Messiah
[1:09:39] that they have in the land and and how
[1:09:41] they wanted to mock him and they they
[1:09:43] welcomed him without actually anointing
[1:09:45] him with oil without washing his feet
[1:09:48] without greeting him with a kiss all of
[1:09:50] the things they're supposed to do and
[1:09:52] and this prostitute is the one that was
[1:09:54] able to do that that was able to
[1:09:56] recognize it a prostitute off the street
[1:09:59] took the money that she earned through
[1:10:01] her living came bought this oil and
[1:10:04] anointed him for burial she recognized
[1:10:07] him and washed him with her feet gave
[1:10:10] him all that he needed a prostitute did
[1:10:13] and what did the word say Jesus said
[1:10:16] this name this woman will be mentioned
[1:10:18] throughout history all the way to the
[1:10:21] end of the world This Woman's name she
[1:10:24] will be mentioned and I don't know if it
[1:10:25] says her name but this woman and what
[1:10:27] she did for him what a tremendous thing
[1:10:29] it is sometimes we don't have to do very
[1:10:32] much and the Lord acknowledges us
[1:10:34] brothers and sisters that's my point
[1:10:36] paragraph 107 he had responded to the
[1:10:39] words of James have not the Faith of Our
[1:10:41] Lord Jesus Christ with the respect of
[1:10:44] persons full of the Holy Ghost and Faith
[1:10:47] as was Stephen he respected no one he
[1:10:50] feared no one and when death was
[1:10:53] pronounced upon all who would take that
[1:10:55] name and walk in the faith of Jesus
[1:10:58] Christ he took his stand with those who
[1:11:01] had not turned back yes he died but like
[1:11:05] Abel he obtained a witness from God his
[1:11:08] name is written in the word and though
[1:11:12] dead his voice his voice still speaks in
[1:11:17] the pages of God's Divine record what a
[1:11:20] tremendous thought another faithful
[1:11:22] martyr was carried to his rest but Satan
[1:11:25] did not Triumph then even as he did not
[1:11:28] Triumph when he killed the Prince of
[1:11:30] Peace for as Satan was despoiled at the
[1:11:33] cross even so now will the blood of
[1:11:36] Antipas cry out to hundreds more who
[1:11:39] will take up their crosses and follow
[1:11:42] him amen amen where Satan's seat is
[1:11:46] paragraph 108 the reason that this is
[1:11:48] part of the eulogy of the spirit is
[1:11:51] because these brave Soldiers of the
[1:11:53] Cross were overcoming Satan right in the
[1:11:56] midst of his own throne
[1:12:00] room and you know that's not just
[1:12:02] exclusive to them brothers and sisters
[1:12:04] every single time we come to church and
[1:12:05] we show whose side we're on every single
[1:12:07] time we go on our knees and we speak to
[1:12:09] the Lord just oneon-one every single
[1:12:12] time we worship the Lord every single
[1:12:14] time we speak his name as Believers of
[1:12:16] this message of the hour we are the
[1:12:18] exact same we are overcoming Satan right
[1:12:22] in the midst of his own throne room this
[1:12:25] here is Satan's Eden but God has come to
[1:12:29] take a bride of his own choosing and I
[1:12:31] believe he has called her they were
[1:12:34] winning the battle through the name and
[1:12:37] Faith of Jesus right in the camp of the
[1:12:41] leaders of Darkness what a tremendous
[1:12:45] Commendation like the Mighty Man of
[1:12:48] David who invaded the camp of the enemy
[1:12:50] to bring David thirst quenching water oh
[1:12:53] my I have this highlighted here so these
[1:12:55] Giants so I want to say tonight brothers
[1:12:58] and sisters don't just make this a book
[1:12:59] of History make this a book about us
[1:13:02] amen let's look at this and recognize
[1:13:04] that these Giants that we're speaking
[1:13:06] about are the spiritual ones that
[1:13:07] actually receive the word of their day
[1:13:10] and not only just receive it by
[1:13:12] receiving it become it amen and when we
[1:13:15] become it we manifest it so these Giants
[1:13:19] of Faith invaded the realm of Satan's
[1:13:22] Earthly stronghold and by preaching Ing
[1:13:25] and exhorting brought the water of
[1:13:27] Salvation to those who lived under the
[1:13:29] shadow of death amen I know I lived
[1:13:32] under the shadow of death maybe that's
[1:13:34] why it gets me excited I know what it
[1:13:36] means to live under the shadow of death
[1:13:38] to actually come out of the shadow of
[1:13:40] death and get into the light of the s o
[1:13:42] n and when that happens brothers and
[1:13:45] sisters it's the next level it's
[1:13:46] something different
[1:13:48] amen now as much as these words
[1:13:50] concerning the throne and Realm Of Satan
[1:13:52] are a part of God's praise for his elect
[1:13:54] they
[1:13:55] actually set the stage for the
[1:13:57] denouncement of the evil that has gained
[1:14:00] Supremacy in the church pergamus Satan's
[1:14:04] Throne dwelling throne and dwelling
[1:14:07] place to many these phrases have been
[1:14:10] merely pictorial rather than truly
[1:14:13] historical but they are surely real and
[1:14:16] history bears that out pergamus was
[1:14:18] indeed the throne and Dwelling Place of
[1:14:20] Satan it happened on this wise pergamus
[1:14:24] was not original the place where Satan
[1:14:26] as concerning human Affairs dwelt
[1:14:29] Babylon has always been literally and
[1:14:31] figuratively his headquarters it was in
[1:14:34] the city of Babylon that satanic worship
[1:14:38] had its
[1:14:40] origin now we have Genesis 11 verse 1-9
[1:14:44] and Kush begot Nimrod and began to be a
[1:14:48] mighty one in the earth he was a mighty
[1:14:50] Hunter before the Lord and the beginning
[1:14:54] of his King kingdom was Babel and Eric
[1:14:58] and aad and Kel and the land of shinar
[1:15:02] Genesis 10 8 8 to 10 and the whole earth
[1:15:05] was of one language and of one speech
[1:15:07] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[1:15:09] from the East they found a plane in the
[1:15:12] land of shinar and they dwelt there and
[1:15:15] they said one to another go too let us
[1:15:17] make brick and burn them thoroughly and
[1:15:20] they had brick for stone and slime they
[1:15:22] had for Mortar and they said go too let
[1:15:24] us build us a SI a city and a tower
[1:15:27] whose top May reach unto heaven and let
[1:15:30] us make a name lest we be scattered
[1:15:33] abroo the abroad upon the face of the
[1:15:35] earth I heard it said the reason they
[1:15:38] did this the reason they had this
[1:15:39] inspiration was because of the
[1:15:41] flood they never wanted to be drowned
[1:15:44] out by the flood they wanted to actually
[1:15:45] overcome the flood water so let's build
[1:15:48] a tower that we can run ourselves into
[1:15:51] and never have to deal with the wrath of
[1:15:52] God again what a terrible thing that is
[1:15:56] and the Lord came down to see the city
[1:15:58] and the tower which the children of men
[1:16:00] build it and the Lord said behold the
[1:16:03] people is one and they have all one
[1:16:05] language and this be they begin to do
[1:16:10] and now nothing will be restrained from
[1:16:12] them which they have imagined to do can
[1:16:14] you imagine that nothing will be
[1:16:16] restrained from them go to let us go
[1:16:18] down and therefore confound their
[1:16:20] language so that they may not understand
[1:16:24] one another's spech speech so the Lord
[1:16:26] scattered them abroad from then upon the
[1:16:30] face of all the Earth and they left off
[1:16:33] to build the city therefore is the name
[1:16:35] of it called Babel which the Lord did
[1:16:39] there confound the language of all the
[1:16:41] Earth and from then did the Lord scatter
[1:16:43] them abroad upon the face of all the
[1:16:47] Earth Babel or Babel is the original
[1:16:52] name for Babylon it means confusion
[1:16:55] it was literally started by Kush the son
[1:16:58] of ham and we know who ham was ham was
[1:17:02] the one that mocked his
[1:17:04] daddy Noah we'll get into that a little
[1:17:07] bit later Lord
[1:17:09] willing uh but it was brought to a
[1:17:12] kingdom of power and Grandeur under his
[1:17:14] son Nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod
[1:17:17] according to the Genesis 11 account and
[1:17:20] also according to profane history set
[1:17:22] out to accomplish three things he wanted
[1:17:25] to build a strong nation which he did he
[1:17:28] wanted to propagate his own religion
[1:17:31] which he did he wanted to make a name
[1:17:34] for himself which he also
[1:17:37] accomplished his accomplishments were so
[1:17:40] Monumental that all the kingdom of
[1:17:42] Babylon was called the head of gold
[1:17:45] amongst all the world
[1:17:48] governments excuse me that religion
[1:17:51] gained
[1:17:53] prominence is Pro proven by the fact
[1:17:55] that scripture identifies it with Satan
[1:17:58] completely in Isaiah 14 and in
[1:18:00] Revelations chter 17 and 18 and by
[1:18:03] history we can prove that it invaded the
[1:18:06] whole world and is the basis for every
[1:18:09] system of
[1:18:11] idolatry my and the theme of
[1:18:15] Mythology through the names of the god
[1:18:17] though the names of the Gods differ in
[1:18:19] various sections of the land according
[1:18:21] to the language of the people that he
[1:18:24] made a name for himself and his
[1:18:26] followers goes without saying for as
[1:18:28] long as this present age goes on until
[1:18:31] Jesus reveals himself to his Brethren
[1:18:34] that's the two witnesses in Israel he
[1:18:39] will be woried and honored though under
[1:18:41] a different name from Nimrod and in the
[1:18:44] temple slightly different from the one
[1:18:47] which was originally
[1:18:48] adored since the Bible does not
[1:18:51] deal in the histories of other nations
[1:18:54] in detail it will be necessary to search
[1:18:56] the Ancient Ancient profane records to
[1:18:59] find our answer as to how pergamus
[1:19:01] became the seat of satanic religion of
[1:19:05] Babylon the major sources of information
[1:19:07] will be the records of Egyptian and
[1:19:09] Grecian culture the reason for this is
[1:19:12] that Egypt received her Science and
[1:19:15] Mathematics from the caldan and in turn
[1:19:19] Greece received them from Egypt now
[1:19:22] since the priests were in charge of
[1:19:24] teaching teaching these sciences and
[1:19:26] since these Sciences were used as a part
[1:19:29] of religion we already know the key as
[1:19:32] to how the babylonish religion gained
[1:19:35] its strength in these two countries it
[1:19:38] is also true that where whenever a
[1:19:41] nation was able to overcome another
[1:19:43] nation in due time the religion of the
[1:19:48] subduer became the religion of the
[1:19:51] subdued it is well known that the Greeks
[1:19:55] had the very same signs of the zodiac as
[1:19:58] did the Babylonians and it has been
[1:20:01] found in the ancient Egyptian records
[1:20:03] that the Egyptians gave the Greeks their
[1:20:06] knowledge of
[1:20:09] polytheism thus the mysteries of Babylon
[1:20:12] spread from Nation to Nation until it
[1:20:15] appeared in Rome in China India and even
[1:20:20] in both North and South America we find
[1:20:23] the very same same basic worship amen
[1:20:27] these ancient histories agree with the
[1:20:29] Bible that this babylonish religion was
[1:20:34] most certainly not the original religion
[1:20:36] of the Earth's
[1:20:37] peoples it was the first to drift away
[1:20:41] from the original faith my but it was
[1:20:45] not itself the original one historians
[1:20:48] such as Wilkinson and mallet have proven
[1:20:52] conclusively from the ancient documents
[1:20:55] that at one time all the peoples of the
[1:20:58] earth believed in one God Supreme
[1:21:01] Eternal Invisible by whom the word of
[1:21:05] his mouth spoke all things into
[1:21:08] existence and that in his character he
[1:21:11] was loving good and
[1:21:16] just excuse me but Satan will always
[1:21:19] corrupt whatever he can we find him
[1:21:22] corrupting the minds and hearts of men
[1:21:24] so that they reject the
[1:21:26] truth as he has always attempted to
[1:21:29] receive worship as though he were God
[1:21:32] and not the servant and creation of God
[1:21:36] remember that when you're dealing with
[1:21:38] Satan when he comes around and tempts
[1:21:40] you just remind him that he is a servant
[1:21:43] and creation I mean he used to be a
[1:21:45] servant he is now a servant he's
[1:21:48] actually used as a tool in the hand of
[1:21:50] God to bring to pass God's will but when
[1:21:54] Satan comes around to tempt you don't
[1:21:55] don't think about him being co-equal
[1:21:57] with God and having some great position
[1:21:59] beside God the only thing he has is the
[1:22:01] ability to come and try and accuse the
[1:22:03] Brethren Before the Throne that's the
[1:22:05] only thing he can do but we know we have
[1:22:08] Jesus Christ standing there interceding
[1:22:10] for the
[1:22:12] Saints but he is a servant and creation
[1:22:15] of God I just like to dwell on these
[1:22:16] things once in a while just to remind
[1:22:18] him just to put him in his place to
[1:22:20] remind us that he is a servant we're not
[1:22:23] a servant with with the bride of Jesus
[1:22:27] Christ he drew worship away from God to
[1:22:30] the end that he might draw it unto
[1:22:32] himself and so be exalted he certainly
[1:22:35] did accomplish his desire to spread his
[1:22:37] religion throughout the whole world this
[1:22:40] is auth authenticated by God in the Book
[1:22:43] of Romans when they knew God they
[1:22:45] glorified him not as God until they
[1:22:48] became vain in their imaginations and
[1:22:50] through darkness of heart accepted a
[1:22:53] corrupted religion
[1:22:55] to the extent that they worshiped
[1:22:57] creatures and not the Creator I remember
[1:23:00] hearing about this quite early on when I
[1:23:02] first started coming around the message
[1:23:04] how that is exactly what's going on
[1:23:06] today you can see it all over the place
[1:23:09] the creatures are being worshiped way
[1:23:11] more than the Creator what a terrible
[1:23:13] thing remember Satan was a creature of
[1:23:16] God Son of the morning thus we find that
[1:23:20] where once truth was disseminated
[1:23:23] amongst men and all held to that one
[1:23:26] truth there later came a day when a vast
[1:23:29] group turned from God and spread a
[1:23:32] diabolical form of worship around the
[1:23:36] world around the world my history Bears
[1:23:40] it out that those of the tribe of Shem
[1:23:42] that stood with the unchanging truth
[1:23:44] were in solid opposition to those of ham
[1:23:48] who turned away from the truth to the
[1:23:50] devil's lie there is no time to engage
[1:23:53] in a discussion of this it is merely
[1:23:55] introduced that you may see there were
[1:23:58] two religions and two only and the evil
[1:24:01] one became
[1:24:04] worldwide I love how he just takes it
[1:24:07] right back to the beginning
[1:24:08] hey monotheism turned to polytheism in
[1:24:12] Babylon the devil's lie and the devil's
[1:24:15] Mysteries rose up against the truth of
[1:24:17] God and the mysteries of God in that
[1:24:20] City Satan truly became the God of this
[1:24:23] world and exacted worship from those
[1:24:27] that he had duped causing them to
[1:24:31] believe that he was truly the Lord you
[1:24:34] know we talked about it on Sunday that
[1:24:36] uh really it's what's in the heart of
[1:24:38] the
[1:24:39] individual brother brandom says that
[1:24:41] there will be millions and billions of
[1:24:44] impersonators of Christianity in this
[1:24:46] age yes at the End of Time millions and
[1:24:49] billions of people and you know it's not
[1:24:52] up to us to put people in or take people
[1:24:54] out we know where we stand when we're
[1:24:56] worshiping we know exactly where we
[1:24:58] stand when we're worshiping and and and
[1:25:00] it's important for us to know where we
[1:25:02] stand when we're worshiping but if we've
[1:25:04] got the right heart then God is going to
[1:25:06] receive our worship and and I'll say
[1:25:08] this too and I might be going a little
[1:25:10] bit far and I I just think it's
[1:25:12] important to to bring a balance to it
[1:25:14] all in the midst of those millions and
[1:25:16] billions of impersonators of
[1:25:19] Christianity there's going to be people
[1:25:20] that truly are Christians yes they just
[1:25:23] haven't heard about this truth that we
[1:25:25] have heard about but they still Worship
[1:25:27] in spirit and in
[1:25:31] truth the polytheistic religion of the
[1:25:34] enemy began with a trinitarian
[1:25:37] Doctrine it was way back there in
[1:25:41] Antiquity that the one God in three
[1:25:44] persons idea came into existence how
[1:25:47] strange that our modern theologians have
[1:25:50] not spotted this how strange but
[1:25:54] evidently just as duped by Satan as
[1:25:56] their for forbears were they still
[1:25:59] believe in three persons of the godhead
[1:26:01] let us be shown just one place in
[1:26:04] scripture where there is any Authority
[1:26:06] for that Doctrine people are willing to
[1:26:08] accept a tradition they really are we
[1:26:10] were having this discussion recently I
[1:26:12] thought it was astounding really you
[1:26:14] know when you look at the story of John
[1:26:16] the Baptist there came a time where
[1:26:18] there was a corner turned right in in
[1:26:21] the scriptures Jesus himself God came
[1:26:25] and manifested the word before all
[1:26:27] mankind he came and John the Baptist
[1:26:30] said hey don't follow me follow him I'm
[1:26:32] not worthy to actually lose the the
[1:26:34] shoelaces on this man he is the one this
[1:26:38] is the one follow him stop following me
[1:26:40] but people still want to follow John yes
[1:26:42] sir right where I'm going with that is
[1:26:45] even today right today people are still
[1:26:47] following the teachings of John the
[1:26:51] Baptist we need to get into Christ amen
[1:26:58] how strange that our modern theologians
[1:26:59] have not spotted this but evidently just
[1:27:01] as duped by Satan as their forebears
[1:27:03] were they still believe in the three
[1:27:04] persons of the godhead let us be shown
[1:27:07] just one place in scripture where there
[1:27:09] is any Authority for that Doctrine and
[1:27:13] that is really the the the final the
[1:27:16] final Act to that discussion when you
[1:27:18] have it with someone let's see it in the
[1:27:19] Bible the Great Commission all the
[1:27:22] disciples they knew who that was Sir
[1:27:26] they knew exactly who that was they
[1:27:28] recognized his voice it was the Lord
[1:27:31] Jesus
[1:27:32] Christ is it not strange that while the
[1:27:35] descendants of ham were on their way in
[1:27:38] satanic worship which involved basic a
[1:27:40] basic concept of three gods that there
[1:27:43] is not one trace of the descendants of
[1:27:45] Shem believing such a thing or having
[1:27:48] any ceremonial worship that involved
[1:27:51] even a type of it it is not strange
[1:27:55] it is not strange that the Hebrews
[1:27:57] believed here oh Israel the Lord thy God
[1:28:01] is one God if there were three persons
[1:28:04] in the godhead Abraham the descendant of
[1:28:08] Shem in Genesis 18 saw one God with two
[1:28:12] angels and we know that's where Abraham
[1:28:16] was on The Plains of mamory in the door
[1:28:18] of his tent In the Heat of the day we
[1:28:20] know the story three men appeared but
[1:28:23] Abraham said Lord and we know that lot
[1:28:27] recognized the two men that went down to
[1:28:29] Sodom and called them
[1:28:32] Lords now paragraph 123 now how was this
[1:28:37] Trinity expressed it was expressed by an
[1:28:40] equilateral triangle even as it is
[1:28:43] expressed in Rome today strange the
[1:28:47] Hebrews did not H have such a concept
[1:28:50] now who is right is it the Hebrews or
[1:28:53] the Babylonians
[1:28:55] in Asia the polytheistic idea of three
[1:28:58] gods in one came out in an image with
[1:29:02] three heads on one
[1:29:05] body I'm going to get some visual aids
[1:29:07] for this I'm going to be dwelling on
[1:29:09] this a little bit I think it's really
[1:29:11] important to recognize this is this
[1:29:13] isn't just print on a page he's actually
[1:29:16] talking about I'm sure that we all
[1:29:18] understand this it's it's it's very real
[1:29:21] uh in Asia the polytheistic idea of
[1:29:22] three gods in one came in the image of
[1:29:25] three Gods three heads on one body sorry
[1:29:28] he is expressed as three
[1:29:31] intelligences and that is in Asia in
[1:29:34] India they found it in their hearts to
[1:29:37] express him as one God in three forms
[1:29:40] now that really is good modern day
[1:29:42] theology in Japan there is a great
[1:29:44] Buddha with three heads like the one we
[1:29:47] previously described but the most
[1:29:50] revealing of all is that which sets
[1:29:53] forth the trinity Arian concept of God
[1:29:56] in a Triune form of one the head of a
[1:29:59] old man symbolizing God the Father to a
[1:30:03] circle which in the Mysteries signified
[1:30:07] seed which in turn means the sun three
[1:30:12] the wings and tail of a bird a dove here
[1:30:15] was the doctrine of the Father Son and
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost three persons in the
[1:30:22] godhead a veritable
[1:30:24] Trinity you can see the same thing in
[1:30:27] Rome and you can if you do go to I think
[1:30:31] it's St Peter's Basilica is that right
[1:30:34] up behind the altar way up there you can
[1:30:37] see what was just described and in the
[1:30:40] center of it is actually a dove and and
[1:30:42] it's to represent the Holy Spirit
[1:30:45] brother Bram says now let me ask once
[1:30:47] again is it not strange that the devil
[1:30:50] and his worshippers actually had more
[1:30:52] truth revealed
[1:30:54] than the faith than the father of Faith
[1:30:57] Abraham and his descendants is it not
[1:31:00] strange that the worshippers of Satan
[1:31:02] knew more about God than the children of
[1:31:06] God it's incredible when you think about
[1:31:08] this now what now what
[1:31:12] is now what is what modern theologians
[1:31:16] try to tell us when they talk about
[1:31:19] Trinity just remember this one thing
[1:31:22] from now on these these records are
[1:31:24] facts and this is a fact Satan is a liar
[1:31:29] and the father of
[1:31:30] lies and whenever he comes with any
[1:31:33] light it is still a
[1:31:37] lie he is a murderer and his doctrine of
[1:31:40] the Trinity has destroyed the
[1:31:43] multitudes and will destroy until Jesus
[1:31:46] comes
[1:31:48] amen another place in in the message I
[1:31:51] believe brother Bram says that the
[1:31:54] the doctrine of the Trinity is is from
[1:31:57] hell it's
[1:31:59] terrible because it's tricking people
[1:32:02] and and that's that's really what the
[1:32:04] devil does he he just tricks people he
[1:32:06] deceives people and you know forgive me
[1:32:09] for even saying this but one of the one
[1:32:12] of the most popular rock and roll songs
[1:32:14] of all times unfortunately I I listen to
[1:32:17] that stuff one of the most influential
[1:32:20] songs was written by The Rolling Stones
[1:32:24] and it's called Sympathy for the Devil
[1:32:26] and and one of the lyrics in the song is
[1:32:29] pleased to meet you hope you guess my
[1:32:32] name it it's a terrible thing but that's
[1:32:35] exactly what's happened and we can look
[1:32:36] at that and say well that's the Raging
[1:32:38] devil monster but what about when it
[1:32:40] gets into Christianity that's where it
[1:32:42] becomes treacherous because people
[1:32:44] genuinely think they're serving
[1:32:46] God and that's where worship becomes
[1:32:49] really important we need to know exactly
[1:32:51] where we stand when we're worshiping
[1:32:54] amen goes on to say according to history
[1:32:56] it did not take long for a change to be
[1:32:59] made in this concept of a father and a
[1:33:02] Son and the Holy Ghost Satan took them a
[1:33:05] step at a time away from the truth the
[1:33:09] evolved concept of deity was now one the
[1:33:12] Eternal Father two the spirit of God
[1:33:14] incarnate in a human
[1:33:17] mother wow does that make you think it
[1:33:22] makes me think a divine son the fruit of
[1:33:26] that Incarnation woman's
[1:33:28] seed paragraph 128 but the devil is not
[1:33:32] content he hasn't achieved worship of
[1:33:34] himself yet except in an indirect way
[1:33:39] and he's not going to settle for an
[1:33:41] indirect way he wants to be like the
[1:33:45] one of the most high so he takes the
[1:33:48] people away from the truth still
[1:33:51] further through his mystery
[1:33:54] he reveals to the people that since this
[1:33:57] great invisible father God does not
[1:34:00] concern himself in the Affairs of men
[1:34:02] but remain silent relative to them then
[1:34:06] it follows that he may well be worshiped
[1:34:09] in
[1:34:10] silence and you know I I just thinking
[1:34:12] about this here through his Mysteries he
[1:34:16] reveals to the people I
[1:34:20] I just have to be honest with you as
[1:34:22] soon as I hear somebody talking about
[1:34:24] the message of the hour they want to
[1:34:25] preach about the message of the hour and
[1:34:26] they want to talk about the Mysteries
[1:34:27] and Mysteries and it's mysterious
[1:34:29] Mysteries mysterious I I pump the breaks
[1:34:32] this is revealed this message of the
[1:34:35] hour has been revealed to us it is not a
[1:34:37] mystery anymore that mystery is history
[1:34:40] and when I start hearing that
[1:34:41] continually it makes me wonder if it's
[1:34:44] not this doctrine that we're reading
[1:34:45] about right here remember Satan wants to
[1:34:47] get in so close that it would deceive
[1:34:49] the very elect so to think that he's not
[1:34:51] going to come into the message of the
[1:34:53] hour and try and corrupt the minds of
[1:34:55] the people it's a it's a mistake it's an
[1:34:58] error he's going to come right in he's
[1:35:00] going to try and confuse as many people
[1:35:02] and when it starts to get mysterious
[1:35:04] brothers and sisters that's when we need
[1:35:05] to step back and say Lord you you you've
[1:35:07] revealed it all you've put the sword of
[1:35:09] the word back into the hands of man
[1:35:11] place it into mine let let your spirit
[1:35:13] let your mind come into my life and
[1:35:15] reveal it to me let it not be a mystery
[1:35:17] anymore and I guarantee you if you do it
[1:35:19] genuinely he will reveal it it won't be
[1:35:21] a mystery but brother brother goes on to
[1:35:24] say here actually it means to ignore him
[1:35:26] as much as
[1:35:28] possible I got to read this again he
[1:35:31] hasn't achieved worship of himself yet
[1:35:33] except in an indirect way so he takes
[1:35:35] the people away from the truth still
[1:35:37] further though through his Mysteries he
[1:35:39] reveals to the people that since the
[1:35:41] great invisible father God does not
[1:35:44] concern himself in the Affairs of men we
[1:35:46] pray and he doesn't answer we pray he
[1:35:48] doesn't answer the way we want it
[1:35:49] answered but remain silent relative to
[1:35:52] them then it follows that he will well
[1:35:54] be worshiped in
[1:35:55] silence I can come to a service and just
[1:35:59] say hey I'm here man I was here half an
[1:36:02] hour ago I I was here before even the
[1:36:04] deacons got I'm here I I drug my carcass
[1:36:07] to church can't you accept it what
[1:36:09] brother bradam says here actually it
[1:36:11] means to ignore him as much as
[1:36:14] possible if not altogether this doctrine
[1:36:17] spread around the world also and right
[1:36:19] today in India you see that mult that
[1:36:22] the temples to the Great Creator the
[1:36:24] silent God are strikingly few in number
[1:36:27] since it was not necessary to worship
[1:36:29] the Creator father it was only natural
[1:36:33] that worship swung to the mother and
[1:36:36] child and we know that's Roman Catholic
[1:36:39] but it's not just Roman Catholic is what
[1:36:41] brother brandham brings out here it's
[1:36:43] crazy but it's true I think he calls it
[1:36:46] a
[1:36:47] paradox yeah mother and child as the
[1:36:51] objects of adoration in Egypt there was
[1:36:53] the same combination of mother and son
[1:36:55] called Isis and Osiris in India it was
[1:36:59] isay and osara osara not the similarity
[1:37:03] of names even note the similarity of
[1:37:07] names even I should get some glasses I
[1:37:09] really should in Asia it was seil and
[1:37:13] diois in Rome and in Greece it followed
[1:37:16] suit and in China well imagine the
[1:37:19] surprise of some Roman Catholic
[1:37:21] missionaries as they entered China CH
[1:37:24] and found there a Madonna with child and
[1:37:27] child with rays of light emanating from
[1:37:29] the head of the Babe the image could
[1:37:32] well have been exchanged for one in the
[1:37:34] Vatican except for the difference of
[1:37:37] certain facial features it now behooves
[1:37:40] us to discover the original mother and
[1:37:43] child the original goddess mother of
[1:37:46] Babylon was
[1:37:48] Samar who was called Ria in the Eastern
[1:37:52] countries in her arms she held a son who
[1:37:56] though a babe was described as a tall
[1:37:59] strong handsome and especially
[1:38:01] captivating to woman in Ezekiel 8:14 he
[1:38:05] was called tamuz amongst classical
[1:38:08] writers he was called bakus to the
[1:38:12] Babylonians he was nenus what accounts
[1:38:16] for the fact that he is represented as a
[1:38:18] babe in arms and yet described as a
[1:38:22] Great and Mighty Man
[1:38:24] is that he is known as the husband
[1:38:29] son one of his titles was husband of the
[1:38:33] mother and in India where the two are
[1:38:36] known as iswara and E he the husband is
[1:38:41] represented as the babe at the breast of
[1:38:44] his own
[1:38:45] wife that this nenus is Nimrod of the
[1:38:49] Bible we can affirm by comparing
[1:38:52] comparing history with the Genesis
[1:38:54] account pompus said nenus king of
[1:38:58] Assyria changed the ancient moderate
[1:39:01] ways of life by the desire for Conquest
[1:39:06] he was the first who carried war against
[1:39:09] his neighbors just got thinking about
[1:39:11] this can you imagine that no wars in the
[1:39:14] world yet no no real armies marching
[1:39:17] through the land and conquering and and
[1:39:19] pillaging everything in its way but here
[1:39:22] we have the first first one the first
[1:39:25] account he conquered all nations from
[1:39:28] Assyria to Liber Li to Li Libya as these
[1:39:33] men knew not the Arts of war and you
[1:39:36] know it's just making me think of this
[1:39:38] I'll call the musicians this is a real
[1:39:41] intricate part and I know it's really
[1:39:43] tough but it it's got some really good
[1:39:46] nuggets in here we'll call the music
[1:39:48] musicians as we close here it's it's
[1:39:50] just about 9:00 but I just wanted to
[1:39:54] reread one portion here brother Bram
[1:39:58] talks about how the one who is conquered
[1:40:02] the religion of the subduer became the
[1:40:04] religion of the subdued and so this one
[1:40:08] who was marching through the land
[1:40:10] conquering everyone was taking this
[1:40:12] religion this false religion and
[1:40:15] bringing it to everyone and there's no
[1:40:17] question in my mind that that was
[1:40:18] exactly what Satan wanted he wasn't
[1:40:20] necessarily interested in seeing them go
[1:40:22] and kill people people although he takes
[1:40:24] a lot of pride in that his goal was to
[1:40:27] spread this false gospel he was the
[1:40:30] first who carried war against his
[1:40:33] neighbors
[1:40:35] ninis from Nimrod he conquered all the
[1:40:39] nations from Assyria to Libya as these
[1:40:42] men knew not the Arts of
[1:40:45] War you know what I'm just going to stop
[1:40:47] there maybe stand with me as we we close
[1:40:49] tonight
[1:40:53] I know it's quite a technical portion of
[1:40:56] this study but um there's some really
[1:40:59] important parts in there I think it just
[1:41:01] goes right back to the very beginning
[1:41:03] you know we can say the trinitarian
[1:41:05] doctrine it it started at the at the Nan
[1:41:09] Council but that that trinitarian
[1:41:11] Doctrine as we've learned by reading it
[1:41:13] goes way farther back this is not
[1:41:16] something new this is a very old
[1:41:18] religion and uh and it's not a good one
[1:41:22] let's just go to in prayer as we close
[1:41:25] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:41:26] for your word thank you for the the
[1:41:28] study that we've been able to partake of
[1:41:31] Lord Jesus over the the last many
[1:41:33] Wednesdays and Lord we thank you for
[1:41:36] this church age book we know that it's a
[1:41:38] summary of this message of the hour that
[1:41:40] we cherish in our lives Lord father we
[1:41:43] pray that you would just continue to
[1:41:45] Quicken it to our hearts Lord we pray
[1:41:47] that you would continue to Enlighten us
[1:41:50] father to what you want to have come out
[1:41:53] out of this word Lord Jesus Lord we
[1:41:55] don't esteem a man greater than you we
[1:41:58] know that this this book was authored
[1:42:01] this book was penned by a man but we
[1:42:04] know that truly you are the author we
[1:42:06] don't make this book scripture we know
[1:42:08] this book points to the Scripture it
[1:42:10] doesn't substitute any of his words oh
[1:42:13] Father we just take you and your word
[1:42:16] and and that's the reason why we love
[1:42:17] this book because it does point us
[1:42:19] directly to your word and we know this
[1:42:22] man that you used to to be the
[1:42:24] Vindicated Prophet for this age he he
[1:42:26] gave us the ability Lord Jesus to look
[1:42:28] at your word he said if you can't
[1:42:30] believe my words just take the word of
[1:42:32] God and Father that's what we do we take
[1:42:34] the word of God and we thank you for the
[1:42:36] Lord the amplification of your word
[1:42:39] through the Vindicated Prophet to
[1:42:40] recognize Lord that you took that word
[1:42:42] and you opened it in in the in the hands
[1:42:45] of that man that Vindicated prophet and
[1:42:47] Lord he took that word that sword and he
[1:42:50] placed it in the heart of every single
[1:42:52] person that would dare look upon this
[1:42:54] message of the hour and tonight father
[1:42:56] Lord we pray that that word Lord that
[1:42:59] sword that's quicker and powerful and
[1:43:01] sharper than any two-edged sword that it
[1:43:03] would Lord Jesus cut away all the
[1:43:05] tradition in our lives that it would cut
[1:43:08] away all the theology in our lives that
[1:43:10] it would cut away all the denominational
[1:43:12] teachings in our lives and father that
[1:43:14] it would just make room for your spirit
[1:43:16] in our lives father that your spirit
[1:43:18] could truly come and take up the Abode
[1:43:20] that you created father without hands
[1:43:23] Lord Jesus and we'll be careful to give
[1:43:25] you all the praise father we just love
[1:43:28] you and we thank you we commit each life
[1:43:30] into your hands tonight as we go our
[1:43:31] separate ways father we pray for those
[1:43:33] who are traveling Lord that you would
[1:43:35] keep your hand upon them Lord that you
[1:43:38] would just bless their time bless their
[1:43:40] journey and their Fellowship Lord let
[1:43:42] them be a blessing to the world around
[1:43:43] them that they encounter and father we
[1:43:45] pray that you would bring them home
[1:43:46] safely at the appointed time and father
[1:43:49] we'll be careful to give you all the
[1:43:51] praise now we just ask that you would
[1:43:52] receive receive a little bit of worship
[1:43:54] from us Lord Jesus from our hearts Lord
[1:43:56] oh Father by the faith that you have
[1:43:59] given us Lord Jesus your faith inside of
[1:44:01] us Lord let that worship come from your
[1:44:04] very throne in our hearts we love you we
[1:44:06] thank you we ask all these things now in
[1:44:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
