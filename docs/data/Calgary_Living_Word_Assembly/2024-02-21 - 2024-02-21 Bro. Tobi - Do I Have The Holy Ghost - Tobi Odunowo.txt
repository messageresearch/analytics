musicians so good to see brother Steve and sister Joan and sister Connie as well I was thinking to myself cuz we were out and busy over the weekend and uh they heard me preach on Sunday and uh now they came they they're here in Calgary and having to hear me preach again so just just be with that we praise the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be in his presence tonight and uh thanking our pastor for the opportunity to also stand before the Saints I won't keep you standing for long let let's quickly open to Second Peter chapter 1 other than the fact that I forgot my glasses in the room but they matter if you can grab it for me this model flesh ages right I never believed I'll need glasses I was believing I'll be like my grandmom that did not need glasses and even in a night is thank you but well we use computers and uh that doesn't help us 2 Peter chapter 1 uh I would read the first 12 verses I'll read as quickly as I can because it's a bit of a long read Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge knowled of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby I given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was porched from his old Saints wherefore the rather Brethren give the allegiance to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen wherefore I will will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth the Lord bless the reading of his word please be seated tonight I want to take a bit of an unusual topic believe the lord has laid in my heart and uh the title is do I have the Holy Ghost and I'll take for a subject make your calling and election sure and I believe the Lord laid this in my heart um a while ago so I um I was thinking when the pastor asked me to take the service tonight he came back to me as what the Lord wants us to speak about and uh that had happened um and I was at work I think it was the week before and Brother Kyle sent that uh that message private interview um on the WhatsApp group and I believe that was just Lord confirming that he wanted us to take a look at this now second Peter chap 1: 10 I'll just read the Amplified version here just to give us a context of some of the things I want to talk about tonight it says therefore Believers be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choosing you be sure that your behavior reflects and confirms your relationship with God for by doing those things actively depend developing those virtues you will never stumble in your spiritual growth and will live a life that leads others away from sin in the ministry of brother Braham there were a couple times that people had this question do I have the Holy Ghost and you know when people have those questions they actually I'll say they four possibilities and this is just ordinary logic I forgot the clicker in the room again sorry if I could get that so I don't have to tell the brothers next next all the time but if you can go to the next slide whilst I wait for that so there are people that they have the Holy Ghost and they know that they have the Holy Ghost and there are people that do not have the Holy Ghost but they think that they have the Holy Ghost that is a very thank you very much that's a very dangerous place to be there are also people that have the Holy Ghost but they think they don't have the Holy Ghost and that is where we'll focus on tonight because that is um that is exactly you know what what uh private interview was with sister Bruce and there are people that do not have the Holy Ghost and know that they don't and I hope like if there's anyone like that you're actually trus in the Lord to give you the Holy Ghost because it's a promise and God will never fail to his promise am so brother Braham um a few messages I'll just point us to tonight where brother Braham actually talked about this and there was another message which is titled Blasphemous names where brother Braham also spoke to another about another person that had the same question of whether she had the holy ghost or not and her name was Sister Shepherd now brother Braham I I just read second Peter chapter 1 and this was the text that brother Braham took when he preached the message the stature of a perfect man brother Braham preached that on the four the 14th of October 1962 in the morning and in the evening service he preached the message a guide and then um the thir the the 30th of October that's end of that month he preed the message vision from the Lord I think it was pretty much of a short message and then on 11th of November also 1962 he preached Blasphemous names now in all of the messages that brother Braham preached after the statue of a perfect man brother Braham referred to what he taught um in the stature of a perfect man now when people have I know our pastor is taken you know the this the Holy Ghost series which I'm really enjoying and and I believe it's going to answer a lot of questions and I believe that the Lord will set the fivefold in the church and give the ministry not the the man but the ministry uh uh a gift of discernment to discern the needs of the people and that's why I want to read Ephesians 47-6 he said but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men said now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that ascended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things now he talking about Christ here now verse 11 said and he Christ gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man so God's goal is to bring us to a state of perfection unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and it didn't just say that to the fullness of Christ but a measure of the fullness of Christ because we cannot have all of Christ God bless you Sister Lily welcome back we cannot have all of Christ right we we cannot have the fullness of the goded in us like Christ did but we can have a portion of all of Christ am amen so we'll have all of his attributes but it will be a portion just like what AB Braham will describe you go into an O you go to the ocean you take a cup of water off of the ocean he said that cup of water has got all the elements that is in the water that is in the ocean but it's just a measure of it so that's why he saying it brings us into a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children amen so there will be a time where we'll be children but the intention is not for us to remain as children am the intention is for us to grow and when we start to grow it helps us not to be tossed to and fr and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and conning craftiness why whereby they lie in way to the se but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the old body fitly joins together and compacted by that which every joint Supply it according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of of itself in love so but told us in Blasphemous names he say since the shepherd here I have a lot of qutes to read that's why I put it on the slide so you can read along and we not we'll try not to make it boring tonight it's teaching service tonight not so much of preaching and and jumping around but uh brother Ram said that teaching does what it establishes the church sister Shepherd here and brother Shepherd who are very gracious friends of ours and who come to this Tabernacle and they are precious children of God and this sister Shepherd when I was speaking of my mail the kind of Billy can answer just somebody says send me so many prayer clotes and I pray over them he just answers them back but when it's an individual letter I have to answer it myself you see so I picked up my individual meil and so I was taking it home and I was reading in there it said from Sister Shepherd and it was a dream that she had had of some months ago and she'll never could get it just right until two or three Sundays ago when I taught on this seven Church ages and the Seven fruits second Peter I will take second Peter 1 to add to our faith see so was referring to the message the stature of your perfect man brother Ram went ahead to talk about the stature of a perfect man just give like a rundown of it I brought this so that we can see you know just a reminder of the picture now I'm going to maybe come back to this but if you look at this brother Braham taught about how God builds his individual and then Compares it with how God builds his church through the seven Church ages now I believe from my own understanding the fact that brother Braham brought it together kind of creates a confusion sometimes and if you go back and read that message you have to see where brother Braham took his time to focus on the growth of the individual and in transition to talk about how God has built his church over seven Church ages continually comparing it the reason I said that is if you take a look at this it appears that the individual will never receive the Holy Ghost until he has all those virtues except love but if you go back and read it that's not what brother Braham taught but when brother Braham was describing this trying to show how God built his church he placed that Holy Spirit there to show us that that's what brings the Capstone to the body so that that order applies when brother Bram was talking about the church but we'll find out tonight it doesn't apply when he was talking about the individual not exactly it applies but not exactly so said in 84 of that same message and now the reason I'm saying this that you might get an idea on what sister the sister dreamed so but brah was talking about the stature of a perfect man so that we can have an idea on what sister shepher Dre we don't have time tonight so I'm not going to get to Sister Shepherd's dream but I'm going to talk about how brother Braham explained um basically what the dream was about what the dream did to her to make her understand the statue of a perfect man but the said now the reason I'm saying this that you might get an idea on what the sister dreamed and dream is certainly comparison to what I been teaching now I believe that the reason that there is so much confusion today about the holy spirit it's not correctly taught this was in the time of brother Braham I'm not saying that it's not correctly taught now and you see why brother Braham said that I believe that the baptism is taught and just say the baptism but then be like you say automobile but now I've got several mechanics in this church and I don't know one thing about it so if I make a mistake Brethren remember I'm not a mechanic there has to be coils and plugs and points and valves and everything else that make the automobile and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is a lot goes with that there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proven the Holy Spirit here so now Peter said first Faith now watch it real close now we're going to te teach this for a few minutes sorry I should be okay sorry I'm not there yet yeah we're going to see this for a few minutes Faith now is your is now is your first and add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience to your patience godliness to Godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love and anyone knows that love is God God is love see now and about grounding the so that you will see when the sister's dream is being told he said now this things here absolutely must be in the Christian before the holy ghost ever seals them before this comes down on top and makes a complete unit so if you read this in isolation you can come to a conclusion that if you don't have all the virtues then you cannot have the Holy Spirit but let's keep going so the first question I want to bring tonight is do I have to possess all those virtues just like I said before I'm sealed with the Holy Ghost or before I receive the Holy Ghost stature of a perfect man brother brah said so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit pours through you in these virtues then you are a living Tabernacle then people look and say that's a manful of virtue knowledge and beliefs the word Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a kind of sweeter Godly person you are sealed now brother BR said they seal shows on both sides so I'm already given a background to this because the ceiling is on two sides is what brother is saying whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or a woman possesses this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost then the word keep following Brother Bram then the word coming from here sorry yeah okay you're helping me thank you I was get getting confused then the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of this beings see and makes this complete being of Tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ words those people are because his life is in here they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 that's right see you reckon yourself dead and you are born of Faith then virtue and these other things is that to you till you are a perfect living image of God that's wonderful so brother brah tells us that the virtues are built but there's something that happens that seals at the end but first a sealing happens because as we've read brother Barry reminded us just a few sunds ago when he was talking about what the Holy Ghost is brother Braham said the Holy Ghost is a seal so when you receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving the Seal of God and brother also quoted Ephesians 4 there 30 that said that when you are sealed you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so nothing can stop that nothing can change it now the next question is the baptism of the Holy Ghost a single event and if we have this answer I think it will help us to start to you know get to understand when we get to those points and you are thinking you don't have the Holy Ghost you will start to see answers why what is going on is going on why it is the way it is and you be able to give yourself the right answer based on what the word of God says now brother brah said in you must be born again and now I'm saying this I know he going on tape and I want to say this to the pastors that will perhaps receive this tape I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular Church teaches I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently prove by the scripture that you are born of the spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit but brah will always say and is a conjunction so it's not a single event you don't just get born again and you are perfect if you go and listen to Blasphemous names I don't have the time but brah was talking about a certain Doctrine where he said people will come and they tell them if you can come and we pray for you you receive the Holy Ghost you immediately become manifested sons of God it was a Doctrine in the time of brother Braham so and brother Braham was explaining that they see their lives is not measuring up to that Perfection that we are talking about but they continually say they are manifested sons of God and we know that if the sons of God are all manifested then the old creature that that is crying They will receive their Redemption because that's what they're waiting for Brother brah now said said now many of them see that that just to come up and be recognized before the congregation and so forth as a sinner that you want to accept Christ as personal savior that is the new birth so if you go to like Pentecostal churches today they will say if you want to give your life to Christ and then they'll bring you you say after them and after you say that they say you're born again how many have heard that before I know brother Marin used to be in Pentecost and sister f but I was as well I was born on the message but I mean I went out there and that's what they do they just kind of force you to speak in tongues and then once you speak in tongues they said you born but it's right happening that right that same day when they asking you to give your life to Christ now brother Braham is saying that receiving Jesus as your personal savior is not the new birth many believe that water baptism is a new birth and some of them believe that you're born of the water when you're baptized in the water there are so many different versions of it lot of them many believe that to recite a Creed and Believe on a doctrine of a church just accepted say I believe the holy church and so and so and believe God to be the savior of man and so forth and from this day on I become a member of this church and fellowship with the Christians they believe that to be born again and although the Creed that the recite and don't I don't believe we could criticize it some of them are pure and holy some of them are real scriptural but the scripture is not applied on the right list and even applying the scripture I believe that the new birth is something beyond that even though how well you might mean it I believe something that the new birth is far beyond your good intentions and your thoughts Minds is beyond that somewhere else said it's an experience it's a birath and it's mercy and we're going to go back back to you know the the interview with s Bruce because he asked s Bruce specific questions Blasphemous names he said now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God remember he said when the member is done has done what has been born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have those virtues in him so there there's not it's not a single event you're born then you have to build the virtues just as we read Paul Peter said you've got to grow up into him so when you there are times you stumble and why are we bringing this tonight because if you have the Holy Ghost and you think you don't have the Holy Ghost you will still make the Rapture for sure but you're going to live an underprivileged life the enemy will continue to make you live be um sorry below your privileges because it's going to you're going to be dealing with guilt and that's exactly what happened to Sister Bruce now when a member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have those virtues in him that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness in him then God seals him or places him now that's something that we need to ponder over just a little bit because brother Braham took time to teach what we call the adoption series which he also titled the placing of sons I don't want to go ahead of myself cuz I read brother brah to us how we doing with time um places him and there that's where you see the Sons and Daughters of God I want to believe AB Braham was referring to the manifested Sons and Daughters of God after they are placed then Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption now some of you Baptist that want to go on eternal security now if you'll come to that stage I'll stand with you what brother R is saying here is you can't say someone comes to the altar receives Christ as their savior speaks in tongues and that's eternal security but if you tell me that someone has received the Holy Ghost and goes on to allow the Holy Ghost to build those virtues in them and they come to a place of placing adoption and you want to call that eternal security I agree with you amen he said but just to say that any just to say anybody says I've joined the Baptist Church I'm a presbyterian I got eternal security said that's wrong your own life proves you haven't got it so they are part of the church but their life denies the word until this is there what is there that thing that he showed to us and God has adopted you and sealed you by the Holy Ghost into his kingdom then there is no getting out of it you are eternally secure believe grieve not the holy spirit whereby all you and your Godly virtues I love that are sealed until the day of redemption now Blasphemous names again he said have you have you heard he ye him the samon I just hear about about a year ago preach become so popular hear ye him the placing of a son is referring to that again in Ephesians 1:5 also God has predestinated us unto adoption of sons he says see a family when a son is born into it it's a son then but that son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son he never become her but if it was the right son and the son that will obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he become hair of what the father had but Abraham was given this in the natural now the difference between what he said here because someone might look at it and said he said oh you know if that son never was the right kind of son then he will not become the for the father would never become adopted in the natural that is true but in the spiritual when you are born again when when you receive the Holy Ghost when you're born as a child God said it is the until the day of your Redemption amen now brother also told us that if that child of God will ever disobey God's word and not repent after God corrects him he said rather than God lose him God will take him off the sin that is eternal security that is that is the that's the reason why we say receive the Holy Ghost because once you cross in there you are eternally safe you are eternally secure the question we're trying to answer which is the second question is that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost a single event now I also said that Braham explained and I don't have all the time but if you read stature of a perfect man you'll see how the Braham talked about being born as babes and needing to grow now in Divine Healing 1954 this is a bit of a long read but let's just because I like the way brother BR described something here that we might relate to he said now you notice those people they can sit and say well I accept the Lord you take their word for it I would to I can't judge God does but in 10 years from now they've never Pro progressed a bit just staying right in the same old place say see we grow daily each day our heart hungers keeps moving on there is something growing inside of you you get bigger spread out can take more am we come to a better understanding of the word there's some things that maybe as a baby you couldn't take there are Corrections that Christ will bring and you will like no I still want to hold on to this maybe it's a bad attitude it doesn't mean you're not filled with the Holy Ghost but as you grow older as you have more experiences with God you start to open up your heart to receive more from him more instruction that is growth he said Paul said told the Corinthian Church you're mature in growing but when you ought to be teachers you're still babes needing teaching is that right when you ought to be teachers something in there growing out pushing out making bigger the Holy Spirit growing said the new birth brother ask a question if a birth is born from the outside from the inside out which is a natural birth the child it grows if it leaves if it doesn't it remains is that right well when a birth is on the inside shouldn't It Grow the Christ in your heart ought to be growing daily getting bigger more powerful understanding things better forgiven walking on as God would till Christ be formed in you the hope of glory it's a growth process that takes us to a state where it becomes easier for us to forgive yes you might have received the Holy Ghost but some things are just hard for you to forgive people of because of how much it hurts you but in growing you get to a point where it doesn't bother you anymore brother Braham had to grow brother Braham was saying this on Sunday brother Braham got to a stage in his life where the testimony about him was that you know he he would he loved everybody even his worst enemies and he said that there were men that will hug him and say to him brother br oh I love and appreciate you and he said by the gift God has given him he could tell that if they had a shortgun they will kill him but he still loved them all the same but brother Braham was not that like that from the beginning brother brah told a funny story in blaser's names when he was talking about growth if you have time just go listen to that message he said the very first time that he had to preach he said he got there and delivered a wonderful service and the women cried and people cried and everything was it felt it felt good so it felt so good at the end of the service he went to his Pastor Roy Davis and said how did I do and said real hopeful I said but the women cried I said no he said because you didn't preach about the Bible you just told a story of an old woman and you made people cry so brother BR himself had to grow he acknowledged the fact that he was once a baby not just in his Christian life but even in the ministry but he had to grow but that doesn't mean he wasn't born but said the new bird if a birth is born from the outside from the inside out the child grows if it leaves if it doesn't it remains is that right well when the birth is on the inside shouldn't It Grow the Christ in your heart ought to be growing daily getting bigger more powerful understanding things better forgiven working on as God would till Christ be formed in you the hope of glory said we must contend with the weak until they are fully mature in Christ Jesus then they are good soldiers then they've got a full they got on the full armor talk about them don't hurt them why because now they're growing laugh at them make fun of them they don't pay no attention to it they got one thing they're just so big my just so full of Glory the only thing you have to drop is this old robe of Flesh so it's taking us to a state where the only thing that we will not be perfect will be our flesh but there's a promise for the flesh there's a promise of redemption for this flesh so it went on to say don't pay attention to you they got one thing they're just so big my just so full of Glory the only thing you have to drop is this old robe of Flesh and just go right on to Glory see somebody say you know somebody said you was a hypocrite Mrs Jones did well God bless them do you know certain certain thing is going on at that church ordering to be going well I'll pray for it see big oh if you're little then you say oh it is let me get in which side must I join see that is where you get in trouble that's where you can't mature we all need growth but when you get big enough large enough you see swelled out not only swelled out but growed out Christ growing in you growing out malice taking it out of you this is a child that's been born this is someone filled with the Holy Ghost push it out as God comes in just pushes it out you say oh how little how jite it is how much kids it is to argue and fce but first thing you know that just grow over top of it and got no more room for it oh I used to hate to see this and hate that but you know I just got so I just don't pay any attention to it no more you're growing yes sir you know when you're young the claim you have growing pains when you growing you know what I mean it means you're getting bigger a little you know you you take your arms will hurt your legs will hurt when you're growing kids I had it I was getting bigger all the time sometimes we have growing pains when we get to be men and women when we're born in the kingdom of God Christ but the thing about that it hurts that's the physical right the thing about this it just makes you joyful and happy you feel more of the presence of God sometimes when you when you move close to the the old veterans you Veterans of the faith you just see how calm they are even in situations because they have experienced God they have seen him they have tried and tested him and they know that he is true so brother Abraham said this you don't feel the pains this one makes you joyful and happy it's growing pains you're going out getting bigger getting to a bigger man now what you used to be you can look over things say not just you got wider shoulders that don't mean nothing about it but you're wider in here see not across here in here is where you're supposed to spread out get bigger in your heart on the inside when Christ comes into the heart now this is Brother describing the progressive process of growth and I could relate with this because I dealt with some things in my life that has to to do with lust and when I read this at the early stage of me receiving the Holy Ghost it helped me to understand what was going on in my life because I didn't just become perfect no evil thoughts I'm not even there yet right but brother Braham made us understand like this that you cannot just allow Satan to deny what God has done because an evil thought which is not your thought comes into your mind and Satan tells you it's yours and then you hold on to it right so when Christ comes into the heart he comes into the mouth then he comes into the eyes it comes into the mind now that is progress a progressive process now he said it comes into the mouth it makes you talk different so that's the first thing you start to do you start to talk like a Christian all the swear words they just disappear you don't talk like you used to Christ got in your mouth don't Gro now from your heart your love you had for him so you can brittle your tongue brother that's a great thing then the next thing you know it grows into your eyes the next thing you know you find out that old lustful things you used to look at you'll turn your head you're growing then the first thing you know you still turn your head your head but you're thinking so I will turn my head but because I was thinking Satan was telling me I didn't have the Holy Ghost but it's a process but you're thinking see after it while it grows into your mind you don't even think about it no more after a while after a while we don't all grow the same sometimes you see a seven-year-old that look like a 10 yearold sometimes you see a seven-year-old they look like a 5-year-old we don't all grow the same but when we were born and as we continue to feed on the word we start to grow amen after a while it grows into your mind you don't even think about it no more then you're just a great big boy then you're coming into a full matured man leaving for the Lord so then you are in Christ then a new creature so what happens between when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost like I've said brother Bram said the seal appears on two sides and he has told us receiving the Holy Ghost when you give your life to Christ and you're baptized in water and what the promise that was given in Acts chapter 238 becomes yours you receive the Holy Ghost what happens in between that and when you become as brother brah said a perfect living image of God anytime we say the first fruit the first sheep came to maturity and was waved what are we saying brother Ram Grew From baby to maturity he grew to a state where he could love his bitterest enemies that's not easy there people that have been in the faith for many many years they're not there yet but we know that that is what we are waiting for for all of us to come to that state like Peter said come to that full measure of the fullness of Christ now brother Bram was asked a question in questions and answers number four this was 1964 I don't try to make a different somewh but the RAM PRI unless he corrects something but I've we've gone from 51 all the way to 64 and I've seen cons consistency in everything but the BR said so this was the question Romans 71418 we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do not for for what I would that I would not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not um unto the law consent to the law that it is good now then it is no more I that dwell it but sin that dwelleth in me and the person said this I cannot understand so it was a question that was given to brother brah let's listen brother braham's answer said well they wrote out the scripture that's Paul speaking to the Romans now he said let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons right one wants me to go do wrong the other wants me to do and every time I start to do right the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing and this morning see same thing I spoke on it this morning temporarily that means brother Braham has spoken to people as at this time he was saying referring to people he had spoken to on private interviews that afternoon that had the same question but said you an outward man which is controlled by six senses it meant five senses here you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith how many of us know that brother said it's only when you have the Holy Ghost that you have that inward sense that is Faith right when you don't have the Holy Ghost it is doubt but when you receive the Holy Ghost it is faith that tells us that he's talking about someone that has the Holy Ghost and this Faith disagrees with all five senses if the five senses don't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the five senses agree with the faith wonderful but when the five senses disagrees with faith then leave leave the five senses alone now for instance here Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that is true the Inside Man is the Holy Ghost in you the outside man which is this flesh reasons that it cannot be true then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man now that's the same thing that Paul is speaking of he was sold under the law to carel scene every one of us is the same having troubles have the troubles we do have married four or five times and this and that all kinds of sin and adulteries everything else all together in our lives is because of those things and brother brah is not saying here that someone has received the Holy Ghost would do those things brother brah was explaining that that is a natural thing that we have to deal with because the Holy Spirit we're going to get there very soon gives us the ability to put this body under control we are carnal and that must perish but then inside we a spirit Man soul inside and that's faith in God's word then we bring a outside body under subjection to the Word of Faith by accepting what God Said the person who has not received the Holy Ghost might desire to bring their body under subjection but they're not able to but the person who has received the Holy Ghost is able to bring their body under subjection however we're going to read it very soon in a minute they still have a sticky nature that bothers them when they in this flesh what does that mean they are tempted by it it doesn't say they always fall into the temptation but even if they ever fall into that Temptation they rise immediately that is a sign you know you don't do something and you wait 5 months before you confess it I won't say you don't have the Holy Ghost but check it but if you have the Holy Ghost the thing that brings conviction in your heart is that Holy Ghost to say what why how would I have done this and you want to make it right right away brother brah said how can I take a bir and make a grain of wheed out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockle has been transmitted from a cockle wheat a cockle bur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cockle bur and It produced a grain of weight because there has been a life of weight put in that cockle be so the cockle be if there's no life of wheat in it will still produce colear right because that is the life you whatever the the Lord that God gave let it bring forth according to His Kind now there is a wheat life put in the cocklebur and because there's been a life of weight put in the cocklebur and the life of the cockle has been taken out but the nature of the cockle B is still sticky so though it is carrying the life of the wheat if you're working in the field where that cockoo is you are still going to get those sticky things on your clothes because the outside is a bur and it will be on until this new life has fully been developed now when the wheat fully comes out that nature of the but disappears because the wheat has now taken over has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cber but wheat but while it is on Earth out of the earth and a cockle it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it with as long as you in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you he didn't say it's going to control you it's going to bother you as long as you leave but the inside of you you're born again so the more I take on Christ the more I grow the less it bothers me because I'm putting more of Christ in me I'm feeding it more we're going to get there in a little while as long as you leave but inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin has gone from you but brah went on to talk about an Indian Chief and now he came to the Lord and then talked about a conversation that someone had with this Indian Chief and said to him said to somebody told me he had one time was converted received the Holy Ghost now speaking about the Indian Chief and he said to him how you getting along and he said pretty good good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs in me and one of them a black dog and one of them a white dog and he said they argue all the time said the growl and fight at one another so the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do bad said well Chief which one of them which one of them wins the fight said that depends on the one she feeds the most theah says so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you the nature the carnal nature in you Wars against the spirit of God the desires that when when when when the Holy Spirit tells you go and apologize to that person maybe your wife maybe your husband you feel like well I wasn't wrong she was the one that was wrong when you have the Holy Ghost you you can hold it but you will not be at rest cuz he going to eventually bring that Pride down that carnal nature of pride is going to get it down as long as you're feeding on the word he said that does it now Romans 8 sorry did I read that that just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you depends on the one you carer to which nature you CER to the caral nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it Romans 8:11 to13 Paul says if the spirits of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debors not to the flesh meaning the flesh is there and that's what I want you to know tonight let your expectations be right if you have received the Holy Ghost you might still see that in your life everything is not perfect especially if you don't feed on the word as often as you should especially if you starve the spirit or sometimes you grieve the spirit and how does that happen most times it happens by us resisting the spirit the spirit says do this he said no do this no brother said in the lamb and the dove he said he's going to go set somewhere and keep waiting for you to make your ways right it doesn't mean you lost the Holy Ghost because he also said you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but what he want so that he will not cut short your life that's something we should not forget if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and we decide not to listen to God he gets to a point where he says well rather than you disgrace me I'll cut shut your life that's also part of what said but we don't want to deny what God has done because we don't want to live an underprivileged life so Paul is telling us we're not de us we're de is not to the flesh to live after the flesh if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if if ye through the spirit do modify the Deeds of the body ye shall leave now the word modify what it means here is to put to death I put to that make us that I render weak important so the more we St this nature the things in likes the end entertainment he loves the pride that he loves to have the way he likes to look at himself as as better than others all those attributes of the flesh the more we start it the more we modify it now just in closing I'm going to read the private interview there are 15 paragraphs there if you can bring that up that would be good thank you there are 15 paragraphs there I will be quick I know that it's almost um 9:00 kids are going to school tomorrow hours as well so I know what that means so this was an interview that brother Braham had with sister Bruce um visit in the hospital brother Bram said I visit you in the hospital that time and I prayed constantly so she wasn't in the hospital now but brother BR was referring to the time he visited her constantly God won't let you die cuz you of value to the church praise God now I know you I know you are going to be all right sister to Bruce I believe that with all my heart sister Georgia Bruce says brother Braham most of all I want the experience that I have been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart she had a heart condition she was really sick she didn't know if she was going to make it so this was the primary objective that she had this is the top request I want to be sure I have the Holy Ghost I believe with all my heart that you are real Born Again believer that's brother Braham replying to her sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person sister Bruce says yes and you get things in your mind see a little bit of things it just keeps building up both ways some people are built to be overthinkers a little thing happen happens the thought just keeps going oh that's why they did this oh that's why I did that oh and then oh wow they felt bad about it and then the enemy gets you to build something that did not exist you get things on your mind see little bit of things it just keeps building up both ways and you'll get somebody in your heart you want to pray for them get up and pray for it you can't rest till you get that person prayed for the holy spirit says pray for someone you can't so she she was built that way um you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side Satan Maybe Might present something out of this way see then God you are a nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not you're not a Believer see you keep building this and maybe this and this see don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember I'm fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of that I think what will I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now what will he do if he was s sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you and with his great faith see you'll get well well I'm I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him but remember me being a Sina and before oh God I'm not a sinner neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we are not Sinners no more we are Christian I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman I remember remember the thing sister Bruce says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times said that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes won't be led to you see he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve him the desire sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see not your mistakes you not looked not led to to you see is your propitiation see is your sin offering your sins are not known you not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him sister Bruce says but I have never had an experience that I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on remember she lived in a in a time where everyone said for you to know that you have the ho ghost you got to speak in tongues there's certain things you have to do all of those manifestation she couldn't put her foot on any of those things and that was a good question because right here she was say I don't think I have the Holy Ghost all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born and sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speak in lies that's the nature of a human being now brother Braham was trying to tell us that the holy spirit is not a single event by replying sister Bruce there is a birth and there is a growth that was your nature so the nature that brother BR was referring to is our old nature born in sin shaped iniquity come to the world to speak in lies that was your nature it changed once but what Chang it she said Christ said there you are sister see that's it he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me at eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but Earth past tense passed from that to life St John 5:24 Jesus speaking so once you know that your nature changed that shows that you receive the Holy Ghost because it's only God that can change your nature you desire the right thing you have received the power the things that you used to do before like Paul said the life that I now live is no more I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me but then he still said I find another law in my members that is Waring against the law of God brother Ram said so you are a Christian sister Bruce I've watched your life I've watched you under Vision now he gets into the prophetic R I've watched you on the vision she didn't think she was born again she didn't think she had the Holy Ghost but the prophet of God could see her on the vision and say I've watched you on the vision and know you are a Christian not one spec see I'm your Shepherd as it was Sister Bruce says yes somebody to help see if there was any doubt in my mind if I thought you were something was wrong I'll tell you sister Bruce I believe that she said but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and God as far as I know anything about it sister Bruce there's another thing there is not one thing and then he said that we're going to pray I'll call the musicians now it's right nine other dots but brothers and sisters don't let the devil lie to you if you set your life and you haven't received the Holy Ghost it's it's it's not something that you need to T for the time they were told to T was in the time when Jesus J ascended they had to T onto the day of Pentecost since that time there's been no taring that was required meaning that it is available even right now but if you have been filled with the Holy Ghost and you've lost the joy of your salvation but the Braham said that David did not lose his salvation you only lost the joy of it and after losing that Joy he was asking God to restore unto me the joy of my salvation there's a restoration tonight if there are questions in your heart about the Holy Ghost and you know that God has changed your nature it's not hard just tell the devil you're a liar God has exposed you tonight and then you continue to feed on the word continue to feel that spirit of God that's in you that nature of God that is in you and before you know you will completely kill the de of the body let's be on our [Music] feet dear father I believe it's your design that this will go this way tonight I believe with all my heart that there are people that have this question on their heart and you have just brought it this way to meet the needs of your people they are your people there Lord Jesus and you care about them that's why Lord Jesus you yourself plac as gifts the fivefold in the church you didn't just leave your church Lord Jesus to try to fend for itself you are ascended on high but you give gifts unto men not because the men are worthy Lord Jesus but because you are worthy and you able Lord Jesus to continue to meet the needs of your people I ask Lord Jesus Christ for the anyone that had that question as you have given them an assurance tonight May Satan never be able to deceive them again May the enemy never be able to Lord Jesus confuse them Lord Jesus Christ father Lord with whatever Lord Jesus is happening in their lives Lord if anyone has lost the joy of their salvation I ask Lord that you restore unto them the joy of that salvation I ask you help each and every one of us to grow in you Lord Jesus to take time and add each of those virtues there Lord and how do we add them just by feeding on the word Lord how does a child grow just by eating the right food the right nutrients Lord being in their body there's a law within the body Lord Jesus to make it grow as long that there are no diseases in there and it's the same in the spiritual Lord Jesus help us to feed on your word help us Lord Jesus to to do less of feeding this flesh Lord Jesus Lord help us to look at oh Lord our calendars Lord our Tim table for the day Lord Jesus look at our the trend of things we do during the day Lord and take an inventory Lord Jesus of how much time we spend on things that will feed our souls versus things that will feed our bodies help us Lord Jesus we know Lord that the old creation is is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and Lord Jesus this is the time we are Lord Jesus for that manifestation Lord we just ask Lord Jesus that you receive the glory and the thanks for this service tonight

spirit Lord confirm to me that I've got the Holy Spirit confirm to me that if you were to call me home today there's nothing between my soul and the [Music] Savior will you bring us all to that point [Music] I don't want to change this atmosphere just I'll call a brother [Music] Emanuel [Music] God bless your Saints um as he spoke I was just thinking about the relationship between parents and their children you see that uh most children want to grow but there is nothing they can do on their own to grow and even parents who wants to see their children grow but they cannot just make them grow by any magical powers but if they do just what is needed just the food and the children just eat it the growth will come right um you see the children and the eating of the food they have to want to eat it and one slight sign of maturity is when the child stops putting the toy in their mouth or the shoe in their mouth or the pen and actually they want to put only food in their mouth that is a sign of matur it's not complete but once they start willfully eating food you know the growth will definitely come and I believe sometimes that is where we have to get to where we are able to overcome the distractions there are so many when we able to overcome them and just focus on what has been given to us cuz I believe there there is no greater treasure handed to humanity than what we have received in this end time so let's just in all humility just just just understand the the dangers of these sweet distractions that surround us and just focus on only and only feeling it's in us the food will bring it out let's bow down our hearts before him our Lord our King our Master Our Savior our friend it's such a privilege just to call you our father and to know that you have a desire to live us to see us grow into your image what a privilege even to be chosen to hear this yes we have the option to accept or reject but together this evening we all accept what you intend to do for our lives Lord father we pray that you give it the spirit to yield to you that you increase our faith oh God that you help us to hold on to this which is the best and the most righteous of all things father help us to live for you oh Lord help us to discern and understand the the goodness in all that you have given us oh Lord and the dangers of all that surrounds it and tends to distract us Lord help us oh Lord we need more of you we desire you oh Lord help us to understand how important help us to know that if you are to come tomorrow of what use is what we are fighting for today be help us to just ensure our Eternal destination before everything else we appreciate you master help us your CH as your children oh Lord even as we call on you now and even as we go our separate ways Let Your Presence go with us oh Lord lead us safely bless us oh God every step of the way help us not to forget the experience we've had today oh Lord and father help us to build on up upon it and and stand
