[39:10] God bless you thank you musicians
[39:13] certainly wonderful to have
[39:16] musicians
[39:18] play the way these ones do
[39:21] with the dedication they do
[39:23] you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to
[39:25] go back to Ephesians chapter 5.
[39:27] I'd like to maybe take a look back at
[39:30] some of the things we spoke about
[39:33] in 2022 and maybe just push forwards a
[39:37] little ways
[39:38] in 2023
[39:41] understanding that although we're
[39:44] talking about this
[39:45] in a a natural sort of a setting
[39:50] husbands and wives and children we want
[39:53] to look at it from a spiritual
[39:55] standpoint according to the message of
[39:57] the hour
[39:59] from a bride's standpoint from a wife's
[40:02] perspective
[40:05] Ephesians chapter 5 first scripture I
[40:08] like to start with is verse 21
[40:10] submitting yourselves one to another in
[40:12] the fear of God if we can't do that then
[40:14] all the rest of it is for naught
[40:18] submitting yourselves one to another in
[40:20] the fear of God wives submit yourselves
[40:22] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[40:26] for the husband is the head of the wife
[40:28] even as Christ is the head of the church
[40:30] and he is the savior of the body
[40:32] therefore as the church is subject unto
[40:35] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[40:37] husbands in every thing
[40:40] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[40:43] also loved the church and gave himself
[40:46] for it
[40:47] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[40:50] with the washing of the Water by the
[40:52] word that he might present it to himself
[40:55] a glorious church not having spot or
[40:58] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[41:01] should be holy and without blemish
[41:05] so what men to love their wives as their
[41:07] own bodies
[41:09] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[41:13] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[41:15] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[41:18] the Lord the church
[41:20] for we are members of his body of his
[41:23] flesh and of his bones
[41:26] for this cause shall a man leave his
[41:28] father and mother and shall be joined
[41:31] unto his wife
[41:32] and they too shall be one flesh
[41:35] this is a great mystery but I speak
[41:38] concerning Christ and the church
[41:41] nonetheless let every one of you in
[41:43] particular so love his wife even as
[41:46] himself
[41:47] and the wife
[41:49] see that she reverence her husband let's
[41:53] just bow one more time gracious Heavenly
[41:55] Father tonight Lord
[41:57] I pray
[41:58] that as a wife we could reverence our
[42:01] husbands
[42:03] father it's so easy to put that off on a
[42:05] woman
[42:06] then that applies to us father help us
[42:09] to take this word tonight and ingest it
[42:11] father Lord Jesus that we would become
[42:14] it father we love you we thank you we
[42:16] ask that you would bless this word now
[42:18] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[42:21] bless you tonight you may be seated
[42:25] certainly thankful to be back in
[42:28] the house of the Lord on a Wednesday
[42:31] we have a prayer meeting tomorrow
[42:34] evening
[42:35] we have the February calendar coming out
[42:37] this week as well
[42:39] it's going to be a busy month and we
[42:42] have a few
[42:43] few things coming up that I think is
[42:45] going to be really good one of the
[42:47] things that we're working on I'll just
[42:49] let everybody know
[42:51] um is gym night we have gym night coming
[42:54] up and we're working on getting that
[42:56] back into the program not the program
[42:59] wrong word into
[43:02] the assembly
[43:04] and we just want to create an
[43:06] environment where we can get together
[43:07] and have a little fun I know a lot of
[43:09] the brothers like to play basketball and
[43:12] the younger kids like to just run around
[43:13] and rip it up and it's a lot of fun so
[43:16] we haven't done it since covet I believe
[43:18] is that right
[43:19] that's a long time
[43:22] so sister Shelley has been investigating
[43:24] for us and I think that we have uh
[43:27] landed on something but we'll confirm
[43:28] that and we'll put it in the calendar
[43:30] when the time is right
[43:32] so you can look forward to that one of
[43:35] the other things I wanted to put out
[43:36] there as well is uh
[43:38] I'm going to do something a little bit
[43:39] different this year and usually
[43:43] um
[43:44] for Easter we'll just have a regular
[43:45] Easter meeting and maybe if we do
[43:48] something special we'll have a guest
[43:50] Minister come in
[43:52] and do that sort of thing but this year
[43:54] we're going to attempt to do something
[43:56] that we haven't done and that is to have
[43:58] a little bit of a Revival
[44:00] and some people might be into it some
[44:03] people might not be I don't want to put
[44:04] too much pressure on anybody but one
[44:06] thing I do know is when you have a
[44:08] series of meetings what happens is
[44:11] there's a climax meeting and the reason
[44:13] for that is because everyone has come
[44:15] and spent the time to be in church and
[44:18] usually if you have a Saturday evening
[44:20] meeting and then you have a Sunday
[44:22] morning meeting that Sunday morning
[44:24] meeting is usually a pretty good meeting
[44:26] because everybody has been gathered
[44:28] together thinking the same thoughts
[44:30] being in one mind and one Accord and so
[44:34] um I believe we've gotten a mission
[44:36] field right here in Calgary it's kind of
[44:38] been my burden for a long time and
[44:40] haven't really been able to put it
[44:42] together in my mind but I believe the
[44:43] Lord's leading me so
[44:45] we're going to have Easter meetings here
[44:48] and uh
[44:49] we'll just see what the Lord has in
[44:51] store so we're working on getting all
[44:54] the uh things figured out and we're not
[44:56] going to have a minister come in from
[44:59] abroad we're going to use the ministry
[45:01] that is in our midst we have some
[45:03] tremendous gifts in the body that we
[45:06] want to give the opportunity to preach
[45:08] and what has been on my heart is simply
[45:12] this brothers and sisters we don't want
[45:13] to grow our church to have a great
[45:16] number of people what we want to do is
[45:18] find that lost last rainbow trout that
[45:23] one soul that God is looking for and the
[45:26] only way he's going to find it is
[45:28] through the body birth and life comes
[45:31] through the body healing comes through
[45:33] the body and so it takes every one of us
[45:36] to be missionaries in our own backyards
[45:39] in our own Fields brother Branham talks
[45:40] about it he says you know we can have
[45:43] the desire to go abroad and into foreign
[45:45] lands in different countries and
[45:47] Minister the gospel but do what does our
[45:49] mailman know what we believe do our
[45:51] neighbors know what we believe do the
[45:54] people around us no we've got a
[45:55] tremendous Mission field and honestly we
[45:58] live in a city of one point whatever
[45:59] million people
[46:01] and there's one and a half churches in
[46:04] Calgary I don't know maybe there's two
[46:05] churches in Calgary and an assembly in
[46:08] Airdrie I don't know how many message
[46:10] churches there really are in Calgary
[46:12] maybe somebody knows that exact answer
[46:13] and we could talk about that but you
[46:16] know when you look at places like
[46:17] Edmonton they have the same sort of
[46:19] number of people but yet there's a
[46:21] couple or three or four maybe even five
[46:24] big Assemblies of people that believe
[46:27] the message of the hour so I don't know
[46:29] what the Lord has in store in Calgary I
[46:32] believe there's people in Calgary that
[46:34] know the message of the hour and just
[46:36] don't know where to Fellowship
[46:38] so anyways we'll just see what the Lord
[46:40] has in store I believe we can have some
[46:42] wonderful Easter meetings so what we're
[46:44] planning and I know everybody I'm glad
[46:46] you're seated maybe we should have the
[46:48] oxygen masks come down and everybody
[46:50] just have a breath what we're going to
[46:51] do is start on Wednesday night we're
[46:53] gonna go Thursday night Friday night
[46:55] Saturday night and we'll end with the
[46:57] Sunday service as well so it's going to
[46:59] be a busy week but I think that
[47:02] something wonderful can happen when we
[47:05] just focus on the Lord and we just have
[47:07] our minds focused on one thing and and
[47:09] my thought was you know if we could just
[47:11] invite that one person that we've
[47:12] thought about witnessing to over the
[47:14] years there's just one person that we
[47:16] just keep talking to and thinking you
[47:18] know I believe there's something special
[47:20] about that person if we just mention
[47:22] that one person you know come and see a
[47:25] man that told me the things that I've
[47:27] done and just see what could happen
[47:29] we never know
[47:30] so anyways
[47:32] um that's coming up in April at the
[47:34] beginning of April we're going to have a
[47:36] formal announcement coming but I just
[47:38] couldn't wait to
[47:39] announce it so
[47:41] here we are
[47:43] um talking about Ephesians
[47:45] Ephesians chapter five
[47:47] you know we we go right back to
[47:49] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21.
[47:52] we we can talk about the the roles of
[47:55] wives and and the roles of husbands and
[47:57] the roles of children and there's so
[48:01] many different things that we've covered
[48:03] over I guess the the services where
[48:06] we've talked about this but
[48:09] tonight I want to talk about submission
[48:11] and understanding that you know we have
[48:13] said that some not everybody can be a
[48:15] husband not everybody can be a wife but
[48:17] we're all children
[48:19] but we're also all claiming to be the
[48:21] Bride of Jesus Christ Living in the
[48:23] bright age
[48:24] so I believe all of this discussion
[48:26] about wives submitting yourselves to
[48:28] your husband is actually applicable to
[48:31] the men it's applicable to the women
[48:33] it's applicable to the children it's
[48:35] very applicable to the lives of the
[48:37] Believers
[48:39] and welcome home brother Mervin and
[48:41] sister Faye
[48:46] I just have to take a moment and and
[48:48] tell you that
[48:50] they were so kind to us
[48:53] they looked after us in a tremendous way
[48:57] thank you
[48:58] [Applause]
[49:02] I believe they had an itinerary set up
[49:05] for uh services and visiting people and
[49:08] the last week when Lisa was so ill
[49:12] they just did everything they could to
[49:14] try and accommodate us and and make Lisa
[49:16] as comfortable as she possibly could be
[49:18] and rearrange things and the schedule
[49:21] just did everything and uh certainly
[49:24] know that you guys sacrifice for us and
[49:27] we thank you for that I just would like
[49:29] to uh invite anybody if you have the
[49:32] opportunity
[49:33] to go and visit someone from the
[49:37] congregations people in the land that
[49:40] they come from I highly recommend it
[49:42] I've done it twice with brother Gilbert
[49:44] in Kenya did it once in the Philippines
[49:47] and uh there's something special about
[49:50] going to meet the Believers and and the
[49:53] people of the people that we fellowship
[49:55] with here it's very powerful it does
[49:58] something really special for everyone
[50:01] I'm sure
[50:02] but uh I've asked brother Mervin as I
[50:04] said last week I'm not going to try and
[50:06] do a presentation because I don't think
[50:08] I could even come close to what brother
[50:10] Mervin could do so I've asked him if he
[50:12] would take the service on Wednesday next
[50:13] week and give a formal presentation of
[50:16] what happened in Philippines before we
[50:19] got there and then maybe when we got
[50:21] there and just talk about it so God
[50:24] bless you thank you so much it was a
[50:26] real honor and privilege to be there
[50:28] with you
[50:30] talking about our scripture tonight
[50:32] um understanding that you know Jesus in
[50:35] this scripture here speaking we know
[50:38] that it was Paul speaking to Ephesians
[50:39] church but verse 26 that he might
[50:42] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[50:45] of the water of the word
[50:47] what he's talking about is is
[50:49] sanctifying and cleansing the church
[50:51] with the washing of the Water by the
[50:55] word and I'd like to just sort of dwell
[50:57] on that tonight
[50:59] what word is that
[51:01] it's the word of the Lord the word
[51:04] that's given to us in the age in which
[51:05] we live in we can say as many people do
[51:08] say well it's the word of God it's the
[51:10] King James version It's The New
[51:11] International Version maybe it's the
[51:13] Amplified version it's it's some of the
[51:15] versions of the Bible but you know we're
[51:18] not talking to the general masses
[51:20] tonight we're talking to the Bride of
[51:21] Jesus Christ who's living in the bride
[51:23] age so tonight when we talk about this
[51:26] we're talking about the word that he is
[51:29] talking about here that he might
[51:31] sanctify and cleanse it with a washing
[51:32] of the Water by the word that's the word
[51:34] of the Vindicated Prophet because as we
[51:37] talked about on Wednesday if you hearken
[51:40] to his voice and listen to my word then
[51:44] you will receive the blessing that I
[51:47] have in store for you but that word that
[51:49] comes forward from a Vindicated Prophet
[51:52] is not just a word of a man that word is
[51:55] the word of God
[51:57] and some people can receive that and
[51:59] some people can't and we know we're not
[52:01] talking to the cats tonight we're
[52:04] talking to the people that can and so I
[52:06] think it's just a wonderful thing to to
[52:09] recognize that he wanted to sanctify it
[52:11] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[52:13] Water by the word of the Vindicated
[52:15] prophet in the age in which they live in
[52:18] that he might present it to himself a
[52:22] glorious church not having spot a
[52:24] wrinkle or any such thing that it should
[52:26] be holy and without blemish so there's
[52:28] nothing that we can do brothers and
[52:30] sisters except for receive that word
[52:32] because that word is what's going to
[52:35] sanctify us so then he will present us
[52:38] to himself as a glorious church not
[52:41] having any spot or wrinkle remember the
[52:44] Prophet this one that that the voice of
[52:46] God spoke through to this age he gave
[52:49] that that Vision that said that there
[52:51] was the preview of the bride and how he
[52:54] saw that church come forward and it was
[52:57] Miss USA say the Church of the United
[52:59] States and and he said oh Lord have
[53:02] mercy all that we have preached for all
[53:04] of the work that we've done over all of
[53:06] the years and this is what it's come to
[53:08] and we know that it was a naked woman a
[53:12] witch brother Branham said dancing to
[53:14] the beat of rock and roll and brothers
[53:16] and sisters I'm not putting off on
[53:18] anybody but you don't have to look very
[53:19] far to see the beat of rock and roll
[53:21] inside a church today
[53:23] you look at most churches and there's
[53:26] the beat of rock and roll that's why we
[53:28] need to temper the music that we have in
[53:30] the church that's why we need to say
[53:33] that if you're going to play an
[53:34] instrument in the church you're not
[53:35] going to play it unless your Holy Ghost
[53:37] filled sorry you have got to have the
[53:40] Holy Ghost otherwise you have another
[53:42] ghost and you're playing music for that
[53:45] ghost
[53:46] remember brother Bradham says it very
[53:48] clearly that many people many people
[53:50] think they're worshiping God it's harsh
[53:52] it's a terrible statement but they're
[53:54] coming to church and worshiping thinking
[53:56] they're worshiping God but they're
[53:57] worshiping Satan
[54:02] he's going to sanctify it and cleanse it
[54:04] with the washing of the Water by his
[54:06] word that he might present it to himself
[54:09] a glorious Church
[54:12] and I want to say a glorious bride not
[54:14] having spot a wrinkle or any such thing
[54:17] but that it should be holy and without
[54:19] blemish
[54:21] and it's interesting when we read this
[54:22] because brother Bradham he says that I'm
[54:24] going to keep saying it over and over
[54:26] again he says that when the when
[54:32] when the church recognizes what it is
[54:34] when she recognizes her position
[54:37] when it recognizes its position but that
[54:42] it should be holy and without blemish
[54:46] and how how does that happen by being
[54:49] washed in the water of the word by by
[54:52] dressing herself in his word not in her
[54:56] righteousness
[54:57] her righteousness is but filthy rags
[55:00] before him we know that
[55:01] so as we go forwards in Ephesians
[55:04] getting into Ephesians
[55:06] Chapter 30 Ephesians chapter 5 verse 32.
[55:10] he says this is a great mystery but I
[55:12] speak concerning Christ in the church
[55:15] but then he goes back to nevertheless
[55:16] let every one of you in particular so
[55:18] love his wife even as himself see that
[55:20] the wife that she reverence her husband
[55:23] how does the wife reverence her husband
[55:25] by reverencing his word
[55:28] when he speaks she says okay okay honey
[55:32] and she doesn't challenge him now some
[55:34] people would say brother Barry you're
[55:36] making her a doormat she he can just say
[55:38] whatever he wants to but remember he is
[55:41] going to sanctify her and cleanse her by
[55:44] the washing of the Water by the word so
[55:46] he's only going to live according to the
[55:48] word that's the commitment that he's
[55:50] making is to live according to the word
[55:53] and we know that we can't live not
[55:56] according to the word at home but
[55:58] according to the word at church because
[56:00] we were talking to the boys about this
[56:01] how sometimes people can behave in
[56:04] different ways at home and different
[56:06] ways at church and I say Lord have mercy
[56:09] on me let me have the same face that I
[56:11] have at church at home because the word
[56:14] of God says that a double-minded man is
[56:16] unstable in all of his ways we want to
[56:19] make sure that we don't have two faces
[56:21] we've got one face and that face is
[56:23] Christ that we represent to our family
[56:25] to our brothers and our sisters but this
[56:28] is a great mystery I speak concerning
[56:30] Christ and the church now this is where
[56:34] we get into kind of what I want to talk
[56:36] about tonight I think it's so good we're
[56:38] probably going to dwell on this for a
[56:40] little while as we go forwards into
[56:43] um
[56:43] the new year so I hope it's okay we'll
[56:47] just see what the Lord has in store with
[56:49] it over in Titus we talked about this
[56:51] last year and Titus Chapter 2 if you
[56:54] want to turn there tonight maybe we can
[56:56] just sort of recap
[56:58] I don't want to take too long covering
[57:01] all the scriptures that we talked about
[57:03] but I just think there's so much to it
[57:08] you know my Bible it says in the in the
[57:11] margin sound Doctrine above chapter 2.
[57:14] and we know chapter 2 verse 1 says but
[57:17] speak thou the things which become sound
[57:20] Doctrine
[57:21] talk about these things
[57:25] speak them
[57:26] that the Aged men be sober grave
[57:29] temperate sound in faith in charity and
[57:31] patience
[57:33] I really want to get into that as we go
[57:35] forwards as well there's some really
[57:37] important things that the men have laid
[57:39] out in the word for them to be and and
[57:41] there's things that the women have laid
[57:43] out in the word for them to be verse 3
[57:45] that the Aged woman likewise that they
[57:47] be in Behavior has becometh Holiness not
[57:50] false accusers not given to much wine
[57:52] teachers of good things
[57:55] that they may teach the young woman to
[57:57] be sober to love their husbands to love
[58:00] their children to be discreet chaste
[58:03] keepers at home good obedient to their
[58:07] own husbands that the word of God be not
[58:10] blasphemed
[58:12] young men also young men likewise sorry
[58:15] exhort to be sober minded in all things
[58:19] showing thyself a pattern of Good Works
[58:22] in Doctrine showing uncorruptness
[58:25] gravity sincerity
[58:27] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[58:30] that he that is of the contrary part may
[58:34] be ashamed having no evil thing to say
[58:36] of you just by living your life Brothers
[58:40] you will preach this gospel
[58:44] you will show people that there's
[58:46] something wrong with their behavior over
[58:49] in First Peter chapter 3
[59:04] remember we're speaking about the Bride
[59:06] of Jesus Christ Living in the bride age
[59:09] which is the astronaut age the countdown
[59:13] is on
[59:16] First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. likewise
[59:19] ye wives be in subjection to your own
[59:22] husbands
[59:24] that if any obey not the word they also
[59:28] May without the word be won by the
[59:32] conversation of the wives
[59:35] the wives can intercede for those
[59:37] husbands that are just a little bit
[59:39] unruly
[59:41] verse 2 while they behold your chaste
[59:45] conversation coupled with fear who's
[59:47] adorning let it not be that outward
[59:50] adorning of planting the hair and of
[59:53] wearing gold or of putting on apparel
[59:56] but let it be the hidden man of the
[59:59] heart
[1:00:01] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:00:04] the ornament of a Meek Spirit a Meek and
[1:00:07] quiet Spirit which is in the sight of
[1:00:10] God
[1:00:11] of great price
[1:00:14] for after this manner in Old Time the
[1:00:16] holy women also who trusted in God
[1:00:18] adorned themselves being in subjection
[1:00:20] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[1:00:24] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[1:00:27] daughters ye are as long as you do well
[1:00:29] and are not afraid with any amazement
[1:00:32] like why is he husbands dwell with them
[1:00:35] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:00:38] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[1:00:40] as being heirs together of the grace of
[1:00:44] life
[1:00:45] that your prayers your prayers be not
[1:00:48] hindered
[1:00:50] looking at this I just wanted to recover
[1:00:53] recap these because it's what we talked
[1:00:56] about in 2022
[1:00:58] and I believe myself I can say I have
[1:01:01] thoroughly grown and learned
[1:01:04] talking about what brother Branham has
[1:01:06] has brought forth and and the many many
[1:01:08] quotes of of recognizing our positions
[1:01:11] as husbands recognizing our positions as
[1:01:15] wives and even recognizing our positions
[1:01:18] as children and even as employees as
[1:01:21] servants
[1:01:22] we can say servants that was for a
[1:01:24] different age a different era but we are
[1:01:27] all servants
[1:01:29] when we work for someone
[1:01:31] and even when we don't work for someone
[1:01:33] when we work for ourselves we're
[1:01:35] actually the biggest servant I would say
[1:01:36] because if you've got your own business
[1:01:38] ain't nobody going to do it for you
[1:01:40] you've got to get up and run and make it
[1:01:42] happen
[1:01:45] so anyways looking at all of this
[1:01:46] brothers and sisters tonight I just
[1:01:48] wanted to talk about the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ Living out through the bride Age
[1:01:51] and and recognizing really our position
[1:01:54] and how we are to submit ourselves unto
[1:01:58] our own husbands we can look at this and
[1:02:01] say you know about the wives but I don't
[1:02:03] want to do that tonight I want to talk
[1:02:04] about the spiritual position of the
[1:02:06] Bride of Jesus Christ and how we are to
[1:02:11] be cleansed by the washing of the water
[1:02:13] of the word as we have read in Ephesians
[1:02:16] 5 verse 26 and 27 he plans to present it
[1:02:20] to himself a glorious church and so I I
[1:02:24] just want to throw this out there as we
[1:02:27] go forwards to recognize it as brother
[1:02:29] Gilbert has said I am my father are one
[1:02:31] that is really the call for this age
[1:02:33] that really is the the requirement for
[1:02:36] us to come to that place because when we
[1:02:38] start to do that brother Bradham says it
[1:02:40] that the shuck will start to pull away
[1:02:42] and then we go back to that seed portion
[1:02:44] but but you know what brothers and
[1:02:46] sisters I think I want to caution every
[1:02:48] one of us myself included to think that
[1:02:50] that shock has to pull away because that
[1:02:52] seed needs that shuck that seed will not
[1:02:55] live without that shuck and remember we
[1:02:57] talked about it on Sunday we're not
[1:02:58] talking necessarily about the seed the
[1:03:00] shock the tassel the the stem The Roots
[1:03:03] we're talking about the life inside it
[1:03:06] that is the key part we can say this
[1:03:09] seed but the seed is for the life and
[1:03:12] that seed has got to die brother Mervin
[1:03:14] brought it so good he said brother
[1:03:16] Branham says that that seed has to rot
[1:03:18] that seed has to die out that's the only
[1:03:20] way that it can come to life again every
[1:03:23] single seed that goes in the ground it
[1:03:24] has to rot in order for that life to
[1:03:27] happen and and here we are talking about
[1:03:30] being the Bride of Jesus Christ and how
[1:03:33] God and man are together again the
[1:03:37] wedding is happening right now and for
[1:03:40] many people the wedding has already
[1:03:42] happened and and as we saw the a
[1:03:45] transition we see the transition I
[1:03:47] talked about it on Sunday how it's no
[1:03:49] longer the laodicean church age it's the
[1:03:51] bride age according to the prophet for
[1:03:53] our day if we believe the prophet for
[1:03:54] our day then it is very much the bright
[1:03:56] age it's no longer laodicea some people
[1:03:58] might be in laodicea but they might not
[1:04:00] have all the seals open and that's just
[1:04:03] up to God to open their eyes it's not up
[1:04:06] to us to judge anyone but we can see it
[1:04:08] by people's behavior and how they
[1:04:10] receive this word of God but to
[1:04:12] recognize that we are living in the
[1:04:14] bride age there is a change of
[1:04:16] dispensation something has happened
[1:04:18] brother Branham says it in the message
[1:04:20] the Rapture it will be astounding for me
[1:04:22] to tell you what's actually taking place
[1:04:24] right now we're not building a wall any
[1:04:27] longer we're building a house and and
[1:04:29] when you come to the corner you have to
[1:04:31] be ready and willing to read the
[1:04:33] blueprint and make the turn when that
[1:04:35] happens and we have been given that in
[1:04:37] our day we talked about it on Sunday how
[1:04:39] he no longer calls us friends oh it no
[1:04:42] longer calls us servants but he calls us
[1:04:43] friends and you you know it goes further
[1:04:45] than that I no longer call you church
[1:04:48] but I call you bride and that was right
[1:04:51] when he was opening the word that's
[1:04:54] going to sanctify us to wash Us by the
[1:04:57] water of the word the word that God came
[1:04:59] and brought through the Vindicated
[1:05:01] Prophet the opening of the seals is what
[1:05:04] gives us the ability to be Sanctified
[1:05:06] otherwise if those seals are closed
[1:05:08] brothers and sisters we're just in a
[1:05:10] denomination
[1:05:11] we're the same as all the rest of the
[1:05:13] people maybe we live good lives and and
[1:05:16] we can gather together and have an
[1:05:18] assembly of people who believe that
[1:05:19] Jesus died and rose again but what good
[1:05:22] is it to to not actually see that the
[1:05:25] seals are open
[1:05:27] there was a purpose for it and it wasn't
[1:05:29] just so that we could say you know the
[1:05:31] the mystery that Paul spoke about over
[1:05:33] in Ephesians he speaks about this of
[1:05:35] being a great mystery but I speak
[1:05:36] concerning Christ in the church this is
[1:05:39] a great mystery that a wife in in this
[1:05:42] day in laodicea in in the bride age can
[1:05:46] actually want to serve her husband
[1:05:48] and and that a husband would want to
[1:05:51] actually love his wife and not just say
[1:05:54] when things get tough you know what
[1:05:56] we'll just call a lawyer and we'll just
[1:05:57] do a separation it'll be a clean
[1:05:59] separation no that is that is the
[1:06:02] mystery that Paul is talking about no
[1:06:04] you and I are one the husband and wife
[1:06:07] are one there is a blending of the two
[1:06:10] this is the mystery that Paul was
[1:06:12] talking about and and brother Branagh
[1:06:14] makes it very clear in the message all
[1:06:16] throughout the message but a little bit
[1:06:18] later on maybe just a little bit more so
[1:06:20] I just want to read a quote today he
[1:06:22] says oh God if the world could only see
[1:06:24] that God and man are one
[1:06:27] the super sign was the first man that
[1:06:29] God come into that God could come into
[1:06:32] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:06:37] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:06:40] church
[1:06:41] now remember
[1:06:43] Branham says in the seals the first seal
[1:06:46] I no longer call you church I call you
[1:06:49] bride
[1:06:51] so where did this get poured into
[1:06:53] brothers and sisters he didn't pour
[1:06:55] himself into denomination
[1:06:58] he poured himself into the bride
[1:07:01] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:07:03] church super sign God and man together
[1:07:08] that was to be the Super sign of the
[1:07:11] last day when the entire Bible was to be
[1:07:14] fulfilled in the last day a super sign a
[1:07:18] virgin shall conceive
[1:07:20] I just love this and this conception
[1:07:23] when it's brought forth
[1:07:26] will be God manifested In the Flesh now
[1:07:30] some people are going to stop and say
[1:07:31] well brother Barry that was Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] according to Isaiah and sure enough it
[1:07:36] was but what about now what about today
[1:07:38] when we take this word into our
[1:07:40] spiritual womb who are you
[1:07:42] what is that that grows inside of you
[1:07:45] what is that that comes to life when you
[1:07:47] fall down and you make a mistake whose
[1:07:49] voice is that that speaks to you that
[1:07:51] says you know what you need to make that
[1:07:53] right you just need to go on your knees
[1:07:55] and and make a correction you just need
[1:07:57] to go and talk to that person what is
[1:07:59] that that's speaking to us
[1:08:02] a virgin shall conceive and this
[1:08:04] conception when it's brought forth will
[1:08:05] be the will be God manifested In the
[1:08:07] Flesh a super sign they still don't
[1:08:10] believe it but it was anyhow it's a
[1:08:12] super sign notice super sign they've got
[1:08:15] a Superman today they've got fictions of
[1:08:18] Superman all these other kind of super
[1:08:20] things
[1:08:21] but the church has got a super sign
[1:08:25] God back in the church
[1:08:29] I just love this God back in the church
[1:08:31] manifested in human flesh
[1:08:35] God United with man his sure super sign
[1:08:41] I'm sure you can guess which message
[1:08:43] this is out of 1963 it's super sign
[1:08:47] 11 29
[1:08:49] this is God back in the church
[1:08:54] and again many people would say well
[1:08:55] brother Barry it's the church it's the
[1:08:57] greater body and God's back in the
[1:09:00] church when you have service you call
[1:09:01] him down and and and the music brings
[1:09:04] him and the preaching is good and when
[1:09:06] it's talking about the word of God it's
[1:09:08] it's it's God back in the church again
[1:09:10] and to some extent it is brothers and
[1:09:12] sisters but I'll tell you this unless
[1:09:14] we're doing it according to the message
[1:09:16] of the hour
[1:09:18] we're bringing something into the church
[1:09:20] but I don't know what it is because if
[1:09:23] we're not bringing it according to the
[1:09:24] message of the hour then we're actually
[1:09:27] missing the word we're missing that
[1:09:29] super sign that super sign brothers and
[1:09:32] sisters is you and I receiving the word
[1:09:35] for our day that's what the super sign
[1:09:38] is that's God back in the church inside
[1:09:40] the believer he doesn't just come to the
[1:09:43] church when we get here and somehow we
[1:09:45] just blend the dimensions and he comes
[1:09:47] brothers and sisters you bring him with
[1:09:49] you he comes with you that's why we need
[1:09:52] to come to church prepared don't come to
[1:09:54] church to meet with Jesus come to church
[1:09:56] to bring Jesus and brothers and sisters
[1:09:59] when you do that then we'll see Super
[1:10:01] Signs in our midst he says notice super
[1:10:04] sign they got a Superman today they got
[1:10:06] fictions of Superman all these other
[1:10:08] kind of super things but the church has
[1:10:11] got a super sign God back in the church
[1:10:14] manifested in human flesh God United
[1:10:17] with man his sure super sign and I just
[1:10:22] want to go back to what we said on
[1:10:23] Sunday the the greatest Miracle of our
[1:10:25] day brothers and sisters is for man to
[1:10:28] be able to be converted into a new
[1:10:30] creature in Christ Jesus according to
[1:10:32] this word not the first poll signs and
[1:10:35] wonders not the second post signs and
[1:10:37] wonders but to have this to be the Super
[1:10:39] sign when you receive the word for your
[1:10:41] day when you get the Holy Ghost the
[1:10:43] baptism of the Holy Spirit when you're
[1:10:45] truly converted and made a new creature
[1:10:47] in Christ Jesus according to the word
[1:10:49] for your day you are that super sign to
[1:10:52] the world around you you are that super
[1:10:54] scientist Satan when he comes around
[1:10:57] that's where we come to the place where
[1:10:59] Satan just won't know what to do with us
[1:11:01] well we'll get so far into the word that
[1:11:04] Satan just won't even want to deal with
[1:11:06] us he doesn't want to get that close to
[1:11:07] the word we know that Adam and Eve as
[1:11:10] long as they were in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:11] and behind that word of God
[1:11:14] the word of God don't do this if you do
[1:11:16] this you're going to die and Satan comes
[1:11:20] around and said oh you're not
[1:11:21] surely you're not going to die
[1:11:25] one word off caused the fall of all of
[1:11:27] mankind as long as they were behind that
[1:11:30] word they were safe but as soon as they
[1:11:32] stepped out from behind that word look
[1:11:34] out they were fair game as soon as the
[1:11:36] children of Israel stepped into their
[1:11:37] promised land they were safe all their
[1:11:39] enemies were dead before them all they
[1:11:41] had to do was be in their position but
[1:11:43] as soon as they stepped up to that
[1:11:45] borderline and got outside of their
[1:11:46] Promised Land
[1:11:48] brothers and sisters it's the same for
[1:11:50] us today
[1:11:52] all we have to do is stay in the word
[1:11:56] all we have to do is
[1:11:58] keep that word in US
[1:12:02] you know sometimes we can have
[1:12:05] times in our lives where we get up to
[1:12:07] that borderline where we get up to the
[1:12:09] edge of our promised land and and I want
[1:12:12] to just sort of bring it down to where
[1:12:14] the rubber meets the road in our lives
[1:12:16] as the Bride of Jesus Christ we can go
[1:12:18] from being the the chaste virgin and and
[1:12:21] having really good positive conversation
[1:12:23] and and being quiet and having that Meek
[1:12:26] Spirit to actually getting to the place
[1:12:29] where corrupt communication comes out of
[1:12:31] our mouth
[1:12:32] and how does that happen
[1:12:34] and I'll say this
[1:12:36] I just want to be real clear you don't
[1:12:38] have to be a woman to gossip
[1:12:42] and and it sounds funny brothers and
[1:12:43] sisters I'm not saying that women gossip
[1:12:45] more than men but I think I've heard it
[1:12:48] inferred that it kind of is that way and
[1:12:50] I want to say it this way it's not that
[1:12:52] way human beings are subject to gossip
[1:12:56] so don't put that off on anyone but the
[1:12:59] word of God says let no corrupt
[1:13:00] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:13:03] but that which is good to the use of
[1:13:05] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[1:13:08] the hearers
[1:13:10] many times we'll read the next scripture
[1:13:12] and saying grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:13:14] God worry about you're sealed unto your
[1:13:15] day of redemption you're sealed to the
[1:13:17] day of redemption that's what the
[1:13:18] prophet of God said but don't grieve the
[1:13:20] Holy Spirit by bringing corrupt
[1:13:22] communication
[1:13:24] say nice things brother Branham said
[1:13:27] talk about your brother uplift him talk
[1:13:30] about your sister uplift her talk about
[1:13:33] your husband talk about your wife talk
[1:13:35] about your children
[1:13:37] children speak about your parents
[1:13:40] speak positive things
[1:13:42] we're living in the third pole ministry
[1:13:45] here
[1:13:46] if we're living under that Ministry the
[1:13:48] third Paul the spoken word
[1:13:50] what words are coming out of our mouths
[1:13:53] who wants to give Satan a day off
[1:13:56] and that's what we do when we start
[1:13:57] going that way
[1:14:00] brother Adam says no he's talking about
[1:14:03] the word and the bride being one this
[1:14:06] super sign I just think it's so
[1:14:08] beautiful recognizing we're living in
[1:14:10] the bright age we're we're in the
[1:14:12] position where any day now the the
[1:14:14] Rapture could go we are having a
[1:14:16] conversation today uh Lisa was listening
[1:14:18] to a message and and she just said you
[1:14:21] know isn't it fantastic when you think
[1:14:23] about it we're 60 years down the road
[1:14:25] but brother Branham spoke about it like
[1:14:28] the Rapture was happening that day or or
[1:14:30] tomorrow like here we are 60 years down
[1:14:33] the road the grace of God we should have
[1:14:35] not a quiet person in the building when
[1:14:38] we recognize the grace of God was just
[1:14:40] waiting for all of us to come to the
[1:14:42] place where we could lift up our hands
[1:14:44] close our eyes and say thank you Lord
[1:14:47] for saving my soul for giving me ears to
[1:14:49] hear what the spirits saith unto the
[1:14:51] church bye the grace of God who knows
[1:14:56] how many more days he'll go maybe it'll
[1:14:58] be another week maybe it'll be another
[1:14:59] decade we don't know that's why we've
[1:15:02] got to hold our potatoes that's why if
[1:15:05] the church keeps growing we're probably
[1:15:06] going to need another building that's
[1:15:08] why other churches are building new
[1:15:10] churches some people say oh the prophet
[1:15:13] of God said you shouldn't do that you
[1:15:14] know what we need to do is keep
[1:15:15] preaching the word keep seeing people
[1:15:18] get Washed by the Water of the word
[1:15:19] that's what we need to see we still have
[1:15:22] to provide for our families I never had
[1:15:24] anybody tell me this if you don't get
[1:15:26] your stuff together and get an education
[1:15:28] how are you ever going to provide for
[1:15:30] your family when that time comes nobody
[1:15:32] put it into words like that that would
[1:15:34] have clicked with me in my mind it was
[1:15:37] just go to school do what you're told
[1:15:38] don't get out of out of order that was
[1:15:42] kind of the way it was in my life I'm
[1:15:44] sorry Dad I know you weren't that way
[1:15:45] but that's the way I perceived it
[1:15:47] anyways
[1:15:49] if somebody would have said to me you
[1:15:50] know what we don't know what's going to
[1:15:51] happen in 10 years 20 years 50 years
[1:15:53] from now you might have one kid you
[1:15:56] might have five kids you might have 14
[1:15:58] children how are you ever going to
[1:15:59] provide food enough for your 14 children
[1:16:02] how are you ever going to give them the
[1:16:04] opportunity to go to university how are
[1:16:06] you ever going to be able to get their
[1:16:08] teeth fixed by the dentist if you don't
[1:16:10] go to school and provide an income for
[1:16:12] your child family for your children if I
[1:16:15] would have had those kind of words I
[1:16:16] might have thought wow you know brothers
[1:16:18] and sisters don't think the Rapture is
[1:16:20] going to save us from doing the harder
[1:16:21] work we've got to do the harder work in
[1:16:23] this life whether it's go to school
[1:16:25] whether it's go to church whether it's
[1:16:27] raise a family whatever it is we got to
[1:16:29] do we got to do it brother Bradham says
[1:16:31] hold your potatoes like he's coming in a
[1:16:33] hundred years but live like he's coming
[1:16:35] tomorrow
[1:16:38] brother random says now here you are a
[1:16:41] person I'm preaching the word saying
[1:16:44] that he's not dead He's Alive
[1:16:47] and you know that's I just have to pause
[1:16:50] there I didn't say it before but that's
[1:16:52] kind of the theme
[1:16:54] uh that I have for
[1:16:56] Easter this year is that he's risen and
[1:16:59] we've said it before in the past and
[1:17:01] we'll probably get right into it in time
[1:17:02] but he's got to be risen right here
[1:17:05] right here
[1:17:07] 2000 years ago it's not good enough
[1:17:10] two thousand years ago won't save you
[1:17:12] today brothers and sisters he's you've
[1:17:14] got to accept him today in the person of
[1:17:16] Jesus Christ in the form of his word but
[1:17:19] that word becomes a life when we live it
[1:17:21] when we accept it into our womb he says
[1:17:24] here you are a person I'm preaching the
[1:17:26] word saying that he's not dead he's
[1:17:28] alive he's alive and promise to identify
[1:17:32] himself in our flesh
[1:17:36] human flesh like he did back there see
[1:17:40] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:17:43] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:17:46] church that's him Christ in US
[1:17:50] now if the Lord Jesus
[1:17:52] has raised him from the dead
[1:17:55] he just has dot dot dot I just want to
[1:17:58] say my own words then we're raised from
[1:18:01] the dead because if we are in Christ
[1:18:04] Jesus then we went to the Grave with him
[1:18:06] we went to Calvary with him we were with
[1:18:09] him when he spoke those words for that
[1:18:11] logos to come out of him to say let
[1:18:13] there be light and we know that it was
[1:18:16] life that came out of him but if we were
[1:18:19] with him
[1:18:20] if we're with them today then we were
[1:18:23] with him then
[1:18:24] isn't it a beautiful thing to recognize
[1:18:26] that there's nothing that we we can do
[1:18:28] there's nothing more that I can do for
[1:18:31] Jesus done at all
[1:18:33] there's nothing more that I can do
[1:18:36] where Jesus Paid It All didn't he isn't
[1:18:38] that the song there's nothing more that
[1:18:40] I could do for Jesus Paid It All
[1:18:43] we're just complete in him
[1:18:46] and you know our wives husbands are
[1:18:48] complete in us and our children are
[1:18:51] complete in in our parents and all we
[1:18:53] need to do is follow the pattern that
[1:18:55] was given to us in the word but when we
[1:18:58] do that then he will take and sanctify
[1:19:01] us and cleanse us with the washing of
[1:19:04] the Water by the word the word of the
[1:19:07] Vindicated Prophet for our day
[1:19:10] I uh I was talking to Eric
[1:19:13] Eric McKay I spoke about him on Sunday I
[1:19:16] baptized him on Saturday and somebody
[1:19:18] mentioned you know it it's too bad that
[1:19:21] we couldn't have done it on a on a
[1:19:23] Sunday and unfortunately we couldn't do
[1:19:25] it on a Sunday he's in a treatment
[1:19:28] facility where he only has a pass on uh
[1:19:31] Saturday between one and nine and so
[1:19:34] that's the reason we did it he said he
[1:19:35] wanted to get baptized he understood the
[1:19:38] gravity of it so I said amen let's do it
[1:19:40] and so uh brother Henry fixed us up
[1:19:43] thank you brother and we met here and I
[1:19:45] just went and picked him up actually and
[1:19:47] brought him here and we have the baptism
[1:19:49] after the musician's practice but you
[1:19:51] know we were just talking about it and
[1:19:53] how wonderful it is to recognize the
[1:19:56] grace of God the goodness of God and and
[1:19:59] I I see in this man that God is still
[1:20:02] calling and it's just a wonderful thing
[1:20:04] because he's talking about the word and
[1:20:07] the importance of the word and how
[1:20:09] people are so confused about the word in
[1:20:12] our day
[1:20:13] but here we have this man who has gone
[1:20:15] through so very much in his life and and
[1:20:18] he's just craving the word and wanting
[1:20:21] to follow the word he knew that he
[1:20:23] needed to get baptized in the name of
[1:20:25] the Lord Jesus Christ according to Acts
[1:20:27] 2 38 to see that word washing a man
[1:20:31] washing a person bringing them to the
[1:20:33] place where they become a new creature
[1:20:35] in Christ Jesus and you know brothers
[1:20:37] and sisters the the end of that is where
[1:20:40] people will say to him you know who are
[1:20:42] you and what have you done with with
[1:20:43] Eric where where is that guy at because
[1:20:46] you're not the same person that I knew
[1:20:48] you're not the same person that I used
[1:20:49] to party with but the thing about it is
[1:20:52] you just no longer desire to hang out
[1:20:54] with those people it's such a beautiful
[1:20:55] thing
[1:20:56] if we could only ever just get to Christ
[1:20:58] and get Christ in us all of the old
[1:21:01] things will just pass away and behold
[1:21:04] All Things become new our lives are no
[1:21:06] longer our lives it's such a beautiful
[1:21:09] thing
[1:21:10] going on in the quotes tonight brother
[1:21:12] Branham says you know it's like I said a
[1:21:14] big arcade
[1:21:15] for we're baptized into that arcade
[1:21:20] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:21:23] one body
[1:21:24] and that body is Christ which is the
[1:21:27] Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:21:28] and heirs to everything that's in it
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:33] and you can see the theme that I'm I'm
[1:21:35] getting at tonight
[1:21:37] and I believe this is the way it is as
[1:21:39] husbands
[1:21:40] we pour ourselves into our wives and
[1:21:42] into our children into our families we
[1:21:45] pour all that we have into them that's
[1:21:47] that's the role of the husband is to be
[1:21:49] the servant unto the the body of the
[1:21:52] family and that's the role of of of
[1:21:55] pastors is to pour themselves into the
[1:21:58] congregation that's the role of a
[1:21:59] prophet to pour himself into the age
[1:22:03] everything that was in God God poured
[1:22:06] into Christ everything that was in
[1:22:09] Christ he poured into the believer amen
[1:22:15] God above us God With Us and God in us
[1:22:21] everything every promise in the book is
[1:22:24] yours
[1:22:25] if you can believe it if you have faith
[1:22:28] enough to accept it and believe it
[1:22:33] I just can't get past this thought
[1:22:35] tonight I know I'm having the devil kick
[1:22:37] me with this saying everything that God
[1:22:39] was
[1:22:40] everything that God was he poured into
[1:22:43] Christ and Christ poured it into the
[1:22:45] church well where is it then
[1:22:47] where is it then I want to tell him it's
[1:22:49] right here
[1:22:51] it's right here and it's in exactly that
[1:22:54] the amen it's in the amen to the word
[1:22:57] for our day that's where it's at that's
[1:22:59] the supernatural that is man and God
[1:23:02] being one that's man being the Flesh of
[1:23:05] God that's God manifesting In the Flesh
[1:23:08] brother Bradham goes on to say you know
[1:23:10] look around if I find something that's a
[1:23:13] little too high
[1:23:14] wonder what's in that
[1:23:17] I'll get me a ladder and push it up
[1:23:19] around and keep climbing till I get to
[1:23:22] it
[1:23:24] he says that's the way a promise in the
[1:23:26] Bible if anything seems like it's kind
[1:23:29] of mysterious to me I just keep on
[1:23:32] praying till I reach it that's all
[1:23:35] that's the way to do it keep praying
[1:23:37] Keep Holding On climbing up believing
[1:23:41] until you're heir to it you got a
[1:23:44] promise to it and you gotta write to it
[1:23:48] Satan will say no you don't got to write
[1:23:50] to it don't you remember what you did
[1:23:51] yesterday don't you remember what you
[1:23:52] thought before church don't you remember
[1:23:54] what you're thinking right now you don't
[1:23:55] got to write to it if you were doing all
[1:23:57] that stuff then then then you would have
[1:24:00] a right to it but I know who you are no
[1:24:02] Satan you don't know who I am you can't
[1:24:03] see the real me one day you will see the
[1:24:06] real me you'll see the real us and we'll
[1:24:09] be like are you the one that troubled
[1:24:11] all the nations
[1:24:13] you'll be just defeated just like you
[1:24:16] are right now
[1:24:17] sorry it's bizarre if I had to go on how
[1:24:20] I feel I would just walk off the stage
[1:24:22] right now my goodness I I just believe
[1:24:25] it with all my heart that Satan does not
[1:24:27] want these words spoken he doesn't want
[1:24:29] the Bride of Jesus Christ recognizing
[1:24:31] her position when she recognizes her
[1:24:34] position that all that God was he poured
[1:24:36] into Christ and all that Christ was he's
[1:24:38] poured into her now let's just take it
[1:24:41] from saying the church to her to the
[1:24:43] Bride of Jesus Christ if you are the
[1:24:45] Bride of Jesus Christ then all that God
[1:24:47] was he has poured into you today
[1:24:49] brothers and sisters when you believe
[1:24:51] this message of the hour and that means
[1:24:53] that Satan is powerless before you
[1:24:55] there's no mechanical climbing to a
[1:24:58] place where someday you're going to
[1:25:00] achieve it all you've got to do is say
[1:25:01] Amen to it I just believe it there's no
[1:25:04] achievements going to get us there
[1:25:06] he says that's the way to do it keep
[1:25:08] praying Keep Holding On keep climbing up
[1:25:10] believing until your heir to it you got
[1:25:13] a promise and you gotta write to it and
[1:25:16] ask and you shall receive for all things
[1:25:19] are possible to them that belief that's
[1:25:21] out of Jehovah Jireh number one in 1964.
[1:25:25] I just think it's such a beautiful
[1:25:27] thought that all that God was
[1:25:30] and what was God
[1:25:32] God was the self-existing one remember
[1:25:35] God is the one that spoke let there be
[1:25:37] light God is the one that divided the
[1:25:39] night from the day he's the one that
[1:25:41] hung every single star and named them
[1:25:44] how many stars are there
[1:25:46] wow how does the universe keep spinning
[1:25:49] how do the planets keep in Balance he
[1:25:52] created gravity all of the dark matter
[1:25:55] that people talk about everything that
[1:25:58] there is everything that there ever was
[1:26:01] or ever will be was created by this God
[1:26:05] this is the one that we're talking about
[1:26:07] that poured himself into Christ
[1:26:10] but then Christ being the man
[1:26:13] manifestation of God poured all that he
[1:26:17] was into the bride
[1:26:20] we don't have to tolerate the devil and
[1:26:22] his antics
[1:26:24] don't worry about how you feel how you
[1:26:26] feel has nothing to do with it the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost is without sensation the Holy
[1:26:32] Ghost says Amen to the word for my day
[1:26:37] all that God was John 1 1
[1:26:41] Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was the
[1:26:43] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:26:44] Word was God we know that brother
[1:26:46] Bradham he quotes it that way many times
[1:26:50] I just want to say it this way in the
[1:26:52] beginning was the logos and the logos
[1:26:54] was with God and the logos was God
[1:26:57] and the logos became flesh and dwelt
[1:27:00] Among Us that logos is now
[1:27:04] in US
[1:27:05] it's not just an inanimate object it's
[1:27:08] not just something that's out there that
[1:27:10] we can say wow Before Time was time
[1:27:12] there was the logos no no no no it was
[1:27:15] all poured out and it's all poured out
[1:27:17] and someone somewhere has to be the one
[1:27:19] to say amen I just accept it the way the
[1:27:22] word says it I don't understand it I
[1:27:24] don't understand how we could have the
[1:27:25] logos living out through us I believe it
[1:27:28] with all my heart that if we have the
[1:27:30] Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[1:27:31] sisters that picture that we see of
[1:27:33] brother Branham you could take his face
[1:27:34] out and put your face in if we had the
[1:27:37] ability to see on that Spectrum we would
[1:27:39] see the pillar of fire over top of every
[1:27:42] single one of the Believers in this room
[1:27:44] tonight
[1:27:46] and you know what good would it do us
[1:27:48] though to be able to see that we would
[1:27:50] be able to say well I can see Believers
[1:27:51] here and Believers there so what what we
[1:27:54] need to do is say can we see the word
[1:27:56] can we believe the word if we can
[1:27:57] believe the word for our day we know
[1:27:59] that Pillar of Fire is there
[1:28:03] but that logos became flesh and dwelt
[1:28:05] Among Us
[1:28:07] we know that he had attributes that he
[1:28:09] wanted to be a father
[1:28:11] that logos wanted to be a husband
[1:28:14] and and wanted to be a son
[1:28:18] and we know that there were seven
[1:28:20] Redemptive names
[1:28:22] for this logos
[1:28:24] Jehovah the mighty Jehovah
[1:28:27] when he became a savior
[1:28:30] we know there's
[1:28:31] Jehovah rohay
[1:28:34] Jehovah Jireh Jehovah he is the Lord is
[1:28:37] my shepherd
[1:28:39] Jehovah Jireh the Lord is my provider
[1:28:43] Jehovah Rapha
[1:28:45] the Lord my healer
[1:28:47] Jehovah shalom
[1:28:50] the Lord my peace
[1:28:52] Jehovah Nissi the Lord my banner
[1:28:57] Jehovah Sid canoe the Lord my
[1:29:01] righteousness
[1:29:03] not not me with my righteousness but the
[1:29:06] Lord my righteousness
[1:29:08] Jehovah
[1:29:10] the Lord is there for me
[1:29:15] he wanted to take a bride of his own
[1:29:17] choosing
[1:29:18] with all of those attributes to let her
[1:29:20] know that every single time she has a
[1:29:23] need he's got it covered
[1:29:25] honey I've got it covered
[1:29:27] could you imagine if we were able to go
[1:29:28] into marriage and say that to our wives
[1:29:30] honey don't worry about it I got it all
[1:29:32] covered everything is looked after it's
[1:29:33] all going to be fine you don't have to
[1:29:35] worry about one single thing in our
[1:29:37] entire lives it's all good I know myself
[1:29:40] I had to go into marriage saying you
[1:29:42] know what I got a little bit of scratch
[1:29:43] of of money and I I think that maybe
[1:29:46] I've got a job and you know maybe it'll
[1:29:49] be okay we'll just go and try this
[1:29:51] together I believe if we have the word
[1:29:53] of God and we've got the Holy Ghost then
[1:29:54] it will work out somehow it'll be fine
[1:29:56] that was kind of my experience with my
[1:29:59] wife I didn't have the ability to say
[1:30:00] don't worry honey everything is looked
[1:30:03] after I don't know how many men in the
[1:30:05] room could do that tonight I'm not
[1:30:06] asking for a show of hands
[1:30:08] but there's one that could and there's
[1:30:10] one that did brothers and sisters he's
[1:30:13] given us that invitation to be his bride
[1:30:15] if we can receive this word of God he's
[1:30:17] got it all covered he's going to be our
[1:30:20] sacrifice he's going to be our Banner
[1:30:22] he's going to be our healer every single
[1:30:24] thing that we have need of he has got
[1:30:27] covered
[1:30:28] such a beautiful thought
[1:30:31] all that Christ was all that God was
[1:30:33] he's poured into Christ which was all of
[1:30:36] those attributes right and now all that
[1:30:38] Christ was he's pouring into the church
[1:30:41] and you know we don't have the time to
[1:30:43] explain all of these I think we could
[1:30:45] probably preach all of 2023 in each one
[1:30:48] of these but here we are all that Christ
[1:30:50] was in John 8 verse 12 then spake Jesus
[1:30:53] again unto them saying I am the light of
[1:30:56] the world he that followeth me shall not
[1:30:59] walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:31:01] light of life
[1:31:04] John 9 4 I must work the works of him
[1:31:08] that sent me while it's day
[1:31:10] the night cometh when no man can work as
[1:31:13] long as I am in the world I am the light
[1:31:17] of the world brothers and sisters
[1:31:20] tonight you are the light of the world
[1:31:23] if you have been the Bride of Jesus
[1:31:26] Christ and he has poured all that Christ
[1:31:28] was into the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[1:31:31] are that light of the world by receiving
[1:31:34] this word for your day and all that
[1:31:37] Christ was he's poured into the believer
[1:31:39] and you know brothers and sisters this
[1:31:41] is where we have the reason to Rejoice
[1:31:43] we know that he's got it all covered we
[1:31:46] cannot miss it you won't miss it
[1:31:49] you will not miss the day of redemption
[1:31:51] you will not miss being there at the
[1:31:54] Judgment Day where you know you're
[1:31:55] seated with him in his throne if you
[1:31:58] receive this word for your day you don't
[1:32:00] have to worry about being saved today
[1:32:01] and lost tomorrow that is a nicolaitan
[1:32:04] lie of the devil
[1:32:06] you will not be lost if you are saved
[1:32:09] that's how God operates
[1:32:12] it's impossible for you to be saved if
[1:32:14] your name is written in heaven
[1:32:17] the Lamb's Book of Life nobody's going
[1:32:20] to strike it from there
[1:32:22] that's why it's so important for us to
[1:32:24] recognize brothers and sisters don't
[1:32:25] focus on the first and second polls
[1:32:27] don't do that remember the disciples did
[1:32:30] in the first and second polls of Jesus
[1:32:32] ministry he sent them out and they came
[1:32:34] back and they were rejoicing they had
[1:32:35] some great Services they cast out devils
[1:32:37] and and healed the sick and raised the
[1:32:39] dead they did all that and and what did
[1:32:42] Jesus say to him don't Rejoice because
[1:32:44] of that don't Rejoice by the many good
[1:32:46] works that's happened Rejoice for one
[1:32:48] reason and that reason is because I have
[1:32:50] taken a bride of my own choosing and
[1:32:52] your names have been written in heaven
[1:32:54] in my blood before the foundation of the
[1:32:57] world that's what you need to Rejoice
[1:32:58] about so brothers and sisters if we have
[1:33:00] the ability to hear the word for our day
[1:33:02] the message of the hour then we have all
[1:33:05] the reason to Rejoice all the reason to
[1:33:07] Rejoice don't get upset if we don't see
[1:33:09] God answer the prayer the way that we
[1:33:11] think that he should answer it or the
[1:33:13] way that we would want him to answer it
[1:33:14] just say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:33:16] word Lord Jesus if you want it to be
[1:33:19] this way then it's going to be this way
[1:33:20] I don't think that it should be this way
[1:33:22] but Lord if it's this way it's this way
[1:33:25] because you're allowing it to be this
[1:33:26] way because there's no accidents that
[1:33:28] happen on this Earth everything is under
[1:33:30] your control
[1:33:32] if our names are written in heaven
[1:33:34] brothers and sisters it causes a
[1:33:36] humility I would say it causes The Godly
[1:33:39] humility we don't get puffed up there's
[1:33:41] nothing in us that says I'm better than
[1:33:43] anybody you know what if we truly have a
[1:33:46] revelation of the godhead in our lives
[1:33:49] if we truly recognize that all that God
[1:33:52] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:33:53] Christ was he poured into the church the
[1:33:55] Bride of Jesus Christ if we have that
[1:33:57] recognition then it causes a humility in
[1:34:00] our lives that's Second To None
[1:34:01] something about it we recognize the only
[1:34:04] reason that we're saved is because of
[1:34:06] his grace and what he's done because he
[1:34:09] chose to take us and sanctify and
[1:34:12] cleanse us with the washing of the Water
[1:34:14] by the word of the Vindicated prophet in
[1:34:17] our day he chose me to be able to have
[1:34:19] ears to hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:34:22] the laodicea in church come out of her
[1:34:24] my people don't be partakers of her sins
[1:34:27] and you know what you can come a little
[1:34:29] higher just like John there's a door
[1:34:31] open in heaven if you want want to go
[1:34:33] there
[1:34:33] the recognition of his grace remember
[1:34:36] when John made it into heaven what did
[1:34:38] he do he saw that there was a book in
[1:34:40] the hand of that one that was Seated on
[1:34:42] the throne not three not two one on the
[1:34:46] throne what did he do he wept much
[1:34:49] because he knew there was nobody in
[1:34:51] Earth or in heaven or anywhere that
[1:34:53] could open that book or even look upon
[1:34:55] it but we know that John being a type of
[1:34:58] the bride was told
[1:34:59] he was told
[1:35:02] just Rejoice John
[1:35:04] for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:35:07] he prevailed
[1:35:09] so that you could live
[1:35:10] he actually didn't just Prevail he
[1:35:13] poured himself into the church
[1:35:17] so that she could prevail
[1:35:19] you know
[1:35:20] looking at Second Corinthians 11 looking
[1:35:23] at just maybe a little bit of a
[1:35:24] different perspective in the last five
[1:35:26] minutes I hope we're okay
[1:35:30] looking at it how God is our husband
[1:35:33] Jesus is our husband the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:37] our husband all three of those are the
[1:35:39] very same being
[1:35:41] they're not different they're not
[1:35:42] separate they're not separate persons
[1:35:44] one God Jesus Christ God almighty and
[1:35:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:35:50] second Corinthians chapter 11. maybe
[1:35:52] turn there with me
[1:35:55] I just think this is such an important
[1:35:57] thing that
[1:35:58] I don't want to overlook it tonight I
[1:36:00] don't know if we'll go much further than
[1:36:01] this
[1:36:02] but
[1:36:04] to look at this to think about the word
[1:36:06] to think about the bride age to think
[1:36:08] about how we've been called to be the
[1:36:11] Bride of Jesus Christ it's not something
[1:36:13] that we can take lightly and say that
[1:36:15] I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and while
[1:36:17] they're cannon fodder or or their
[1:36:18] serpent seed you know what that's that's
[1:36:21] not the humility of Jesus Christ he came
[1:36:24] to the Sinners he came to the ones who
[1:36:26] were actually Bound in Chains naked
[1:36:29] living in the caves with thousands of
[1:36:32] devils in them
[1:36:34] to save them
[1:36:36] second Corinthians 11 verse 1 went to
[1:36:39] God ye could bear with me a little
[1:36:42] in my Folly and indeed bear with me
[1:36:45] why is that
[1:36:47] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[1:36:50] jealousy
[1:36:52] for I have espoused you to one husband
[1:36:57] that I may present you as a chaste
[1:37:00] virgin to Christ
[1:37:03] but I fear lest by any means as the
[1:37:07] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:37:09] subtlety
[1:37:10] so your minds should be corrupted from
[1:37:14] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:37:18] sometimes I believe we can take the
[1:37:20] message of the hour and make it a great
[1:37:22] mystery and and a bunch of
[1:37:24] dark things and and seals and a bunch of
[1:37:28] different things Brothers and Sisters
[1:37:30] Let's Not stray from from the beaten
[1:37:32] path let's remember
[1:37:34] that all that God was he poured into
[1:37:35] Christ all that Christ was he's poured
[1:37:37] into his bride now and and it's that
[1:37:39] simple according to the message of the
[1:37:41] hour we are Jesus Christ on Earth today
[1:37:45] we are all that many people in this
[1:37:48] world will ever see of Jesus Christ I
[1:37:51] I've said it before many times many
[1:37:52] other ministers have probably said it
[1:37:54] brothers and sisters before the Rapture
[1:37:55] comes don't look for some great
[1:37:57] fantastic thing to happen don't look for
[1:38:00] a squeeze don't look for anything just
[1:38:01] look around because this is probably all
[1:38:04] that's going to happen right here what
[1:38:05] we're living right now this is what's
[1:38:07] going to happen and one of these days
[1:38:09] it's going to be the secret sudden going
[1:38:10] away of the Bride of Jesus Christ it'll
[1:38:13] just be a silent thing that'll happen
[1:38:14] the world wants it to be something great
[1:38:17] and big it's not going to be because not
[1:38:19] many people can truly receive this word
[1:38:21] but when we can truly receive this word
[1:38:23] brothers and sisters we have the ability
[1:38:24] to discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:38:26] Spirit within the framework of the
[1:38:28] Christian church and know that Satan is
[1:38:31] powerless before us and it doesn't cause
[1:38:34] any sort of Pride to rise up in our
[1:38:36] lives we don't get to a place where
[1:38:38] we're better than anybody we're worse
[1:38:40] than everyone we recognize that we're
[1:38:42] we're the we're the chiefest of sinners
[1:38:47] but we are one thing and this is what I
[1:38:50] think the critical thing is tonight I'll
[1:38:51] call the musicians as I as I close and
[1:38:54] I'll say this we're subject
[1:38:57] to his headship
[1:39:00] we haven't said this word since we
[1:39:02] started talking about this but I think
[1:39:04] we probably will as we get going
[1:39:06] in terms of the family stuff
[1:39:08] but now we're going to talk about Christ
[1:39:10] in the church this mystery but you know
[1:39:12] what it is it's headship
[1:39:14] and if we can't accept the leadership of
[1:39:17] Christ in our life if we can't have that
[1:39:20] headship then we will never have proper
[1:39:22] headship in our homes that will never
[1:39:24] happen and you know what we talked about
[1:39:27] it before in the past I'll say it again
[1:39:28] if we want to have true communion with
[1:39:30] Jesus Christ then we have to be willing
[1:39:33] to be led we will not ever get to Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ in terms of communion we'll go
[1:39:39] and have the bread we'll go and have the
[1:39:41] wine brother Barry I have communion all
[1:39:43] the time okay we have communion services
[1:39:45] but we're talking about when I say
[1:39:47] communion I'm talking about fellowship
[1:39:49] with Jesus Christ one on one communion
[1:39:51] with the Lord Jesus Christ all that God
[1:39:54] was he poured into Christ all that
[1:39:56] Christ was he poured into the ones who
[1:39:58] are willing to be led those ones who
[1:40:00] aren't willing to be led they don't get
[1:40:02] it
[1:40:02] that that pouring out just goes by them
[1:40:06] but there's some who are subject to his
[1:40:08] headship the first son was a spoken seed
[1:40:11] word of God he was given a bride
[1:40:15] I'm just reviewing brother Brown
[1:40:17] speaking the spirit now is picking up
[1:40:19] what I said see a bride for to produce
[1:40:22] himself she fell
[1:40:26] see that's what the bride was given to
[1:40:28] produce himself again another Son of God
[1:40:30] but she fell by high breeding see
[1:40:34] produced himself but she fell caused him
[1:40:38] to die
[1:40:39] the Second Son a spoken seed word of God
[1:40:43] was given a bride like Adam
[1:40:46] but before he could marry her she had
[1:40:48] fallen also for she was put to free
[1:40:51] moral agency like Adam's wife was to
[1:40:55] believe God's word and live or doubt it
[1:40:58] and die and she did
[1:41:01] then from a little group of true seed
[1:41:05] then from a little group of the true
[1:41:08] seed of the word God will present Christ
[1:41:12] a beloved bride
[1:41:14] a virgin
[1:41:16] a virgin of his word
[1:41:19] and through them and by them will be
[1:41:21] fulfilled all that has been promised for
[1:41:24] his word in the Virgin who knows no
[1:41:28] man-made Creeds or dogmas
[1:41:32] looking at this quote here many times
[1:41:34] I've read the other part of it a little
[1:41:36] further on and I'm sure you know what
[1:41:38] that is if you don't it's the word is in
[1:41:40] the bride
[1:41:42] she has the mind of Christ to know what
[1:41:44] to do with it but I just think this part
[1:41:45] is so wonderful because she has the
[1:41:48] ability to recognize the headship
[1:41:50] submission to her husband and you know
[1:41:54] brothers and sisters if we want to see
[1:41:55] this life lived out through us we have
[1:41:58] got to have headship in our lives we
[1:42:01] have got to be willing to submit
[1:42:03] ourselves to headship if we can't do
[1:42:05] that we will not see true communion with
[1:42:08] God in our lives
[1:42:10] he goes on to say the Word of Promise in
[1:42:13] himself like it was in Mary God himself
[1:42:15] made manifest maybe stand with me
[1:42:17] tonight as I read this he will act
[1:42:20] himself by his own Word of Promise
[1:42:24] so to fulfill all that has been written
[1:42:27] of him as he did when he came from the
[1:42:30] Virgin womb
[1:42:31] type of the spirit womb now
[1:42:34] so will the Virgin now accepting his
[1:42:38] word be it unto me as thou Hast said
[1:42:43] though it was said by an Angel
[1:42:47] while it yet was the written word Isaiah
[1:42:50] 9 and 6.
[1:42:53] I just want to say that he he said there
[1:42:55] will be a virgin bride to his word she
[1:43:00] will be a word virgin
[1:43:03] because she won't accept anything else
[1:43:05] any of the traditional teachings any of
[1:43:07] the old fundamental stuff
[1:43:10] she'll put it aside and say just be it
[1:43:12] unto me according to Thy word this what
[1:43:14] I'm reading here tonight brothers and
[1:43:15] sisters is pick up your pen and write
[1:43:16] but it's before she has thus saith the
[1:43:19] Lord
[1:43:20] he says they will love him
[1:43:23] love his and will have his potentials
[1:43:27] for he is their head
[1:43:31] and they are his subjects
[1:43:33] subject to his head
[1:43:36] ship of Christ was his
[1:43:40] I believe
[1:43:41] by accepting the word for our day we
[1:43:44] accept the fact
[1:43:45] that he poured all that God was into
[1:43:48] Christ and all that Christ was into the
[1:43:51] bride and when we do accept that
[1:43:53] brothers and sisters we live out his
[1:43:56] potentials and his potentials live
[1:43:58] according to his word there's no
[1:44:00] deviance from it and you know if there
[1:44:02] is then something inside of us will rise
[1:44:05] up and say uh oh I need to make that
[1:44:07] right uh oh I need to go and change that
[1:44:09] Lord I just want to make it right with
[1:44:11] you and you know what that's what the
[1:44:12] Bride of Jesus Christ does always
[1:44:15] corrects herself to the word
[1:44:17] let's just bow tonight
[1:44:20] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:44:22] Lord Jesus
[1:44:24] we're so thankful that you are jealous
[1:44:26] over us with a Godly jealousy father
[1:44:30] your bride Lord Jesus you will not allow
[1:44:33] one
[1:44:34] father to be lost
[1:44:36] and father we thank you for the goodness
[1:44:39] of your mercy to us Lord to be able to
[1:44:42] recognize that we are a virgin word
[1:44:45] bride
[1:44:46] father that's not something that we take
[1:44:48] lightly that's something that we can
[1:44:51] think about we can meditate on as we go
[1:44:53] to bed and as we dream father and as we
[1:44:56] wake up what is it like to be the wife
[1:44:58] of Jesus Christ what is it like to be
[1:45:02] the the the wife of the king of the
[1:45:05] universe
[1:45:07] father Lord I pray that the words that
[1:45:10] were spoken tonight would just find the
[1:45:12] mark in the hearts of your children Lord
[1:45:14] I pray that as we go forwards we would
[1:45:16] begin to consider what it is to truly be
[1:45:19] a chaste virgin unto you Lord what it
[1:45:22] means father to have all of your
[1:45:24] potentials father to recognize that you
[1:45:27] have poured all of yourself into us
[1:45:30] that we have the fullness
[1:45:33] of the godhead bodily today
[1:45:37] father we just love you we thank you we
[1:45:39] ask that you would go with us as we go
[1:45:41] our separate ways tonight father I pray
[1:45:43] that you would just anoint us Lord Jesus
[1:45:46] to gather again on Sunday father that
[1:45:49] you would just give us a fresh call off
[1:45:51] the altar Lord Jesus Lord that we would
[1:45:54] just hear from Heaven once again

[1:45:58] your goodness to us we just ask all
