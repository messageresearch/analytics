[42:00] 1959 1219 questions and answers on the
[42:03] Holy
[42:04] Ghost um preached right after the Holy
[42:07] Ghost
[42:09] series Hebrews chapter
[42:11] 6 verse
[42:15] 1 says therefore leaving the principles
[42:18] of the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[42:20] to Perfection amen not laying again the
[42:24] foundation of repentance from dead works
[42:26] and and of Faith toward God and of the
[42:29] doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of
[42:32] hands and of resurrection of the dead
[42:35] and of Eternal
[42:37] judgment and this we will do if God
[42:41] permit for it is impossible for those
[42:45] who were once enlightened and have
[42:47] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[42:50] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[42:53] have tasted the good word of God and the
[42:56] powers of the world to come amen if they
[42:59] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[43:02] repentance seeing they crucify to
[43:06] themselves the Son of God
[43:08] aresh and put him to an open
[43:11] shame for the Earth which drinketh in
[43:14] the rain that cometh of upon it and
[43:18] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[43:21] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[43:24] from God but that that which beareth
[43:28] thorns and Briars is rejected and as
[43:31] nigh unto cursing whose end is to be
[43:35] burned let's just bow one more time amen

[45:40] Grove to take that service and uh I
[45:43] apologize I can't remember exactly who's
[45:45] taking the services on Saturday I
[45:47] believe that brother Jerry's taken one
[45:48] or two of them but there will be a flyer
[45:51] that will be coming out to actually uh
[45:53] have the formal announcement and the
[45:55] address and uh hope hopefully an RSVP if
[45:58] anyone would like to attend just so
[46:00] there's an idea of how many people will
[46:02] be attending there's has to be two two
[46:05] separate venues for it it's just the way
[46:07] things worked out down there um and yeah
[46:10] we'll have those details to follow uh
[46:13] just a couple of notes that I apologize
[46:15] for not bringing forward sooner from the
[46:17] men's
[46:18] meeting um we're going to start with
[46:20] regular prayer meetings every Thursday
[46:23] at the first Thursday of every month
[46:26] starting a April um so we will begin uh
[46:30] prayer meetings every single Thursday
[46:32] the first Thursday I mean the first
[46:34] Thursday of every single month that's
[46:36] what I'm trying to say in uh in the
[46:39] future so we'll start that April the 4th
[46:42] um and also the communion service was a
[46:45] big topic of conversation that we had
[46:47] during the men's meeting and so we had
[46:49] agreed that we would do a 5:30 start
[46:51] instead of 6:00 and so I do apologize
[46:54] for those people who might be up set
[46:57] because I didn't announce it sooner but
[46:59] we'll have the communion service tonight
[47:00] at 5:30 instead of 6:00 so that we'll
[47:04] have a little bit more time to actually
[47:06] facilitate the service as well as
[47:08] hopefully get everyone on the road back
[47:11] home again at a decent time those people
[47:13] especially with children so if you do
[47:16] come late tonight we will understand
[47:18] it's okay um if a half an hour is going
[47:21] to throw us off that far I do apologize
[47:23] that's my mistake but moving forward we
[47:25] will have communion services at 5:30 one
[47:28] of the other things was that we were
[47:29] going to supply more buckets for foot
[47:31] washing so that we could be more
[47:32] efficient when that time of the service
[47:35] arrives so I trust that we have the
[47:37] buckets in store and uh it should be
[47:39] more efficient for us as well and uh the
[47:42] other thing that was mentioned was we
[47:44] can communicate when we're done somehow
[47:47] there's been a lack of communication
[47:48] between the brothers and the sisters the
[47:49] sisters downstairs and the brothers
[47:51] upstairs I think the brothers have been
[47:53] afraid to go downstairs because of the
[47:54] sisters doing the foot washing but the
[47:56] foot washing is is actually taking place
[47:57] now in the kitchen area so it's kind of
[48:00] behind a closed door I don't think
[48:02] there's going to be anything unts if a
[48:04] brother were to go downstairs and just
[48:05] knock on the door and say we're finished
[48:07] upstairs so um and likewise upstairs if
[48:10] his sister comes up it's fine so uh
[48:13] communication when we're done with the
[48:15] foot washing we want to uh create an
[48:18] environment for this service so that we
[48:20] can give room for testimonies it was a
[48:23] it was a discussion about whether we
[48:25] should have a testimony service separate
[48:27] or whether we should keep it as the
[48:28] communion service and uh I believe it
[48:30] turned into we'll keep it as the
[48:32] communion service with testimonies we'll
[48:34] just give it a little bit more time
[48:35] we'll just maybe see if everyone can be
[48:37] a little more thoughtful with their
[48:38] testimonies so that we don't actually
[48:41] just burn through a bunch of time and
[48:43] the discussion is actually meaningful
[48:45] and uh efficient so I hope that is
[48:48] actually okay um again I do apologize
[48:51] it's my mistake for not bringing it any
[48:53] sooner but like I said if you do decide
[48:55] to come later be because you didn't know
[48:58] before now that's just okay there's no
[49:00] pressure God richly bless you are you
[49:02] happy this morning amen we're going to
[49:05] continue on with our discussion about
[49:07] the uh questions and answers on the
[49:09] Hebrews series on the uh on the Holy
[49:13] Ghost series I do apologize I have
[49:16] really enjoyed this it's been uh a real
[49:19] blessing to me just a real encouragement
[49:21] to see what the prophet has said about
[49:24] this amen I believe the Lord led me to
[49:27] go this way with it and uh you know
[49:30] sometimes as a minister I guess even as
[49:33] a pastor you have to wonder because the
[49:36] devil loves to come around on Monday
[49:39] morning and Thursday morning especially
[49:43] but every other day of the week as well
[49:46] just like everyone but I believe there's
[49:49] a a little bit of a special uh a special
[49:53] portion for the minister for the pastor
[49:56] to wonder whether you're actually doing
[49:58] what God wants you to do whether it's
[50:00] exactly the way God wants you to say it
[50:02] and the one thing that I've learned is
[50:04] the best thing that can ever happen is
[50:06] just to surrender and just let the Lord
[50:08] do it and uh we were talking about it
[50:10] last week brother dawn going into
[50:12] service and you know a lot of the things
[50:14] that are said what Brother Don said were
[50:16] actually on his notes it's not following
[50:19] necessarily a script it's allowing the
[50:22] Holy Ghost to actually lead and it's so
[50:24] important for that to be the case in a
[50:27] Church uh we've talked about it in the
[50:29] past and uh I think even on Wednesday
[50:31] especially with the study of the
[50:33] exposition of the seven Church ages
[50:35] there is the Deeds of the nicians and
[50:37] that's the thing that God hates and that
[50:40] is the leadership of man over man that
[50:43] is where we start to get political and
[50:45] that is where we start to get powerful
[50:47] and that just stops the Holy Ghost right
[50:49] there and the Church of the Living God
[50:52] the message of the hour was sent to
[50:54] actually deliver the people from those
[50:56] bars of bondage of the Deeds of the
[50:59] nictitans and we know brother Bram he
[51:01] had that that that Vision where he said
[51:03] he saw those people trapped behind those
[51:05] bars I can't remember what the message
[51:07] is it's in 1965 though and it's where he
[51:10] sees those people and they're good
[51:11] people and they're tra behind those bars
[51:13] and they can't seem to get out and we
[51:16] know that brother Bram in the end he had
[51:18] the Lord tell him deliver those people
[51:21] oh God and he said House of Hell amen
[51:24] deliver those people in the name of
[51:26] Jesus Christ and he said he could hear
[51:28] the Rocks rolling and the bars bending
[51:30] and those people came out and they were
[51:32] delivered they were good people and I
[51:34] believe it's the same thing for us if
[51:35] we're not careful we can
[51:38] substitute power for programs we can
[51:42] start to say we're going to organize we
[51:45] heard it on Wednesday There's a a little
[51:47] clip in the church age book where you
[51:49] can see that God has moved in your midst
[51:51] and that's where the Devil comes in that
[51:52] Antichrist spirit and Whispers and says
[51:54] now you've got it with you now organize
[51:57] and write it in a book create a program
[52:00] create an Avenue for this Holy Spirit to
[52:02] continue on you've got to protect it
[52:04] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[52:05] protect his word one one second in fact
[52:08] if we do that we get in the way because
[52:10] his word is quick and Powerful it's
[52:13] sharper than any two-edged sword and
[52:15] it's sent to deliver us in the day in
[52:17] which we live amen but talking about
[52:20] questions and answers on the Holy Ghost
[52:21] just a little recap from last time we
[52:23] were ministering here uh thank you
[52:25] brother dawn for expressing all that the
[52:28] Lord placed on your heart from last week
[52:29] really enjoyed that so many points from
[52:32] that you know we can so many points just
[52:35] one thing I wanted to just mention
[52:37] before I get going here is how many of
[52:39] us have created a spiritual ishill in
[52:42] our lives did you catch that part last
[52:45] week we can create our own Avenue for
[52:49] God to move we can say we know that this
[52:50] is what God Said God sent a prophet and
[52:52] he gave us instructions to do it a
[52:54] certain way but we can say well it's
[52:56] just not coming to pass as soon as I
[52:58] want it to so I'm just going to do it
[52:59] the way that I want to do it the way
[53:01] that maybe my wife suggests that we
[53:03] should do it and and it'll turn out just
[53:05] fine but what happens is we create a
[53:07] spiritual ishill I thought that was so
[53:10] good and we know the whole world is
[53:12] reeling from that situation even today
[53:16] how much does that impact us as Sons and
[53:19] Daughters of the most high God but you
[53:21] know uh just going back in in what we
[53:23] were talking about a little bit of a
[53:24] recap from questions and answers on the
[53:25] Holy Ghost brother Bram he starts in
[53:28] this message talking about how you can
[53:30] you can look at the the Jews and the
[53:33] Hebrews and then you can look at the
[53:35] Gentiles and and the anointing that was
[53:37] on the Gentiles in jesus' day was there
[53:39] there was a few different times where
[53:41] people simply spoke the word the Jews
[53:44] wanted the laying on of hands but but
[53:47] the Gentiles the anointing for the
[53:48] Gentiles is to simply speak the word and
[53:51] we know that brother Brown he gives a
[53:53] few different examples for it um the
[53:55] Gentiles who who were at cornelius's
[53:58] house and and while Peter yet spake
[54:00] these words the Holy Ghost fell on them
[54:03] and and the little girl gyrus his
[54:04] daughter you know he said come and lay
[54:06] hands on her but the Roman centor he
[54:09] said I'm not worthy that you come under
[54:11] my roof just speak the word the syrop
[54:15] phenician woman brother brandham says
[54:17] Greek she came and and wanted to
[54:20] actually have a touch from the master
[54:23] and he said you know what it's not meat
[54:25] for the master to feed the children's
[54:27] bread to the dogs called her a dog
[54:31] Gentile syrop phenician Greek dog but
[54:35] what did she say even the dogs eat the
[54:38] crumbs from the master's table speak the
[54:42] word Master that's all I need from you
[54:44] is one word from
[54:46] you and we know for this saying he said
[54:49] for this saying the devil's left your
[54:51] daughter and brother bradam he says
[54:53] quote say good things then say something
[54:57] good about somebody right talk about
[54:59] Jesus say something loyal something
[55:03] real he says that's the way to get rid
[55:05] of devils am so brothers and sisters if
[55:08] we're not saying something loyal
[55:10] something real if we're not speaking
[55:13] good about our brother and sister then I
[55:15] want to say it clearly we're actually
[55:18] passing Devils Back and Forth that's
[55:20] right we're passing Devils Back and
[55:22] Forth hey catch here's a
[55:24] devil who wants to do that
[55:27] it's a trick of the devil right let's do
[55:30] exactly what the devil doesn't want us
[55:32] to do let's say something nice amen the
[55:36] devil's going to come around and say
[55:37] look you just stubbed your toe man that
[55:39] guy just tripped you up something awful
[55:41] he just spit in your face say something
[55:44] nice say something like David said you
[55:47] know God told him to do that just to see
[55:49] what I would
[55:52] do that's the way to get rid of devils
[55:55] is what the prophet told us you know
[55:56] what he's got little little nuggets like
[55:59] this I'll call it a little nugget but I
[56:00] think this is a real big key to the
[56:03] success of a believer in the day in
[56:05] which we live we can talk smack about
[56:08] brothers and sisters and say well it's
[56:10] the truth they said that didn't
[56:13] they we know the prophet another one of
[56:15] those nuggets he would say well they
[56:17] didn't really mean it did they I don't
[56:19] think they really would have meant that
[56:21] because remember on this side we cannot
[56:23] see the real you you can't see the real
[56:25] me
[56:26] we just see this flesh that we're
[56:28] trapped in this is a hybrid condition
[56:31] say nice things brothers and sisters
[56:33] amen say nice
[56:35] things brother Bram he's you know given
[56:38] the question it's it's paragraph 100 in
[56:40] the in the Bible or the table app he
[56:42] says brother bradam please explain
[56:44] Hebrews 6
[56:47] 4-6 and that scripture is for it's
[56:49] impossible for those who were once
[56:50] enlightened have tasted of the Heavenly
[56:52] gift who were made partakers of the Holy
[56:54] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[56:56] God and the powers of the world to come
[56:58] if they shall fall away to renew them
[57:00] again to repentance seeing they crucify
[57:03] to them
[57:05] themselves the Son of God aresh and put
[57:08] him to an open shame I just can't help
[57:12] but think you know when you get someone
[57:13] who is talking talking talking talking
[57:15] that's what they're doing they're
[57:17] crucifying to themselves not to the
[57:19] people they're talking to they're
[57:21] crucifying to themselves the Son of God
[57:23] aresh putting them to an open shame for
[57:26] the Earth which drinketh in the rain
[57:28] that cometh of upon it and bringeth
[57:30] forth herbs meat for it by whom it is
[57:32] dressed receiveth blessing from God but
[57:34] that which beareth thorns and Briars is
[57:37] rejected and is nigh un cursing whose
[57:39] end is to be
[57:41] burned you know you might say well why
[57:43] would you say that brother Barry how
[57:44] come are they crucifying to themselves
[57:47] because they're not actually blaspheming
[57:49] the prophet they're not blaspheming the
[57:50] scripture but I'll say it this way
[57:52] they're not actually displaying The Life
[57:54] of Christ because if they had the fruit
[57:57] of the spirit we would not be talking
[57:59] negative or evil about anyone right
[58:03] nobody questions and answers on the Holy
[58:06] Ghost brother Bram paragraph 163 he says
[58:08] now look if I want to go back to
[58:11] Ephesians the first chapter Paul
[58:12] preaching now the Corinthians each one
[58:15] had a tongue and a Psalm you notice the
[58:17] other churches didn't have that trouble
[58:20] he never said nothing about it did he
[58:22] ever mention tongues anywhere in the
[58:24] Ephesian Church the Roman Church no now
[58:29] I'm I'm going to try and swing back
[58:32] Circle back to that a little bit later
[58:35] on but if we look at it just just
[58:38] zooming out taking a look at it they had
[58:40] signs and wonders in the
[58:42] churches but Paul he didn't go back to
[58:45] correct the Romans or to correct the
[58:48] Ephesians they had the church set an
[58:50] order and how did they set it in order
[58:52] they had the Holy Ghost that's the only
[58:54] way they could have it set in order
[58:57] the only way but the other churches they
[59:00] got the little bit of nickan spirit in
[59:02] them they started to get a little bit
[59:04] out of order and they started to allow
[59:05] things in the church that maybe
[59:07] ordinarily wouldn't be allowed brothers
[59:10] and sisters I just want to say this loud
[59:12] and clear we believe the doctrine of
[59:14] William Mary and brandom because that is
[59:16] the doctrine of Jesus Christ we're not
[59:19] interested in making excuses for cutting
[59:21] hair for wearing garments that pertain
[59:24] to the other gender that's not what
[59:26] we're supposed to do because both is an
[59:28] Abomination if a man wears a garment
[59:30] that pertains to a woman if a woman
[59:31] wears a garment pertains to a man both
[59:33] of them are listed as Abominations in
[59:35] the word of
[59:36] God we don't make excuses for this we're
[59:40] we're not going to allow you know women
[59:42] or men to wear tight clothing if you're
[59:45] going to do that you've got the
[59:47] influence of the wrong
[59:49] Spirit usually it's a prideful
[59:52] Spirit sometimes it's it's in a it's in
[59:55] a physical
[59:56] connotation so people maybe they can see
[59:58] your muscles maybe they can see
[1:00:00] different parts of your body it's the
[1:00:01] wrong influence brothers and sisters if
[1:00:03] that's what we're doing we're not
[1:00:05] interested in making excuses for that
[1:00:08] we're the Church of the Living God am we
[1:00:10] want to follow the doctrine of Jesus
[1:00:12] Christ all the way to the
[1:00:16] letter the Ephesians Church didn't have
[1:00:18] that issue neither did the Roman Church
[1:00:20] brother brandham says questions and
[1:00:22] answers just just doing a recap from
[1:00:24] sort of where we were last week then I'm
[1:00:26] going to try and press forwards here I
[1:00:27] just want to quickly do this here
[1:00:29] paragraph 164 brother Bram he says and
[1:00:31] you say well what about the Pentecostals
[1:00:33] with the tongues then brother Bram I
[1:00:35] think that they got the Holy Ghost he
[1:00:37] says sure they did all right why look
[1:00:39] you believe he's a good god Thomas said
[1:00:43] one time you know
[1:00:45] Lord and and I love the way brother
[1:00:47] bradam says that you know because we
[1:00:49] know Thomas he was he was he's coined
[1:00:51] the doubting Thomas isn't he unless I
[1:00:54] see then I'll believe
[1:00:56] we don't want to get that spirit in our
[1:00:58] midst because that's a spirit brothers
[1:00:59] and sisters unless I see it that's the
[1:01:01] only way I'll believe it the only way
[1:01:03] you're going to be able to believe it is
[1:01:04] because he gives you the ability to
[1:01:05] believe it and if he gives you the
[1:01:06] ability to believe it blessed are your
[1:01:08] eyes because they're able to see the
[1:01:10] things of God Amen Hallelujah and we
[1:01:13] know that Jesus he said it in John
[1:01:15] 20 how much more blessed are they who
[1:01:18] haven't seen but still believe the
[1:01:21] reason for that is they're displaying
[1:01:23] the life of Jesus Christ that Gene seed
[1:01:26] of God is inside of them and when the
[1:01:28] anointed word comes it actually ignites
[1:01:31] that seed it cracks that seed open that
[1:01:33] seed begins to come to life because of
[1:01:35] that spirit because of that word we
[1:01:37] don't want to be a doubting
[1:01:39] Thomas brother bam he goes on to say in
[1:01:41] paragraph 165 he said yes Thomas after
[1:01:43] you've seen me and felt me and put put
[1:01:45] my hand and your hands in my side you
[1:01:48] believe but how much greater is their
[1:01:49] reward who have never seen and yet
[1:01:51] believed how many people here in this
[1:01:53] audience today in this congregation were
[1:01:55] able to see the Lord Jesus Christ none
[1:01:57] of us how many here were able to see
[1:02:00] William Mary and Bram in flesh I don't
[1:02:02] know if any of us but yet something
[1:02:05] inside of us wants to believe in what
[1:02:07] they brought to us now I'm not comparing
[1:02:10] William Mary and brandom to be equal
[1:02:12] with Jesus Christ for the record William
[1:02:14] Mariam Bram was the prophet of Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ he was introducing Jesus
[1:02:20] Christ but how many of us were able to
[1:02:22] see them none of us but we still have
[1:02:24] the ability to believe amen brother Bram
[1:02:26] he says he gives you the desire of your
[1:02:28] heart of course let's just believe him
[1:02:30] and he says that's another nugget here
[1:02:32] that's the death stroke to Satan when a
[1:02:35] man takes God at his word brother
[1:02:37] that'll kill Satan every time that's the
[1:02:39] hardest hitting Satan can get when a man
[1:02:41] will take God at his word yes sir I just
[1:02:46] think that's so powerful amen all these
[1:02:48] little nuggets are huge
[1:02:50] ones huge ones brother R he goes on to
[1:02:53] say leaving the principles of the
[1:02:55] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[1:02:56] Perfection now he's been talking to them
[1:03:00] about the doctrines let's let let us go
[1:03:04] and talk about the perfect perfected
[1:03:07] things now you are perfected in God when
[1:03:11] you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until
[1:03:13] the day of your
[1:03:14] Redemption and that's why I I I just
[1:03:17] take encouragement I told you at the
[1:03:19] beginning I mentioned that sometimes I
[1:03:22] wonder and I'm sure many other people do
[1:03:24] you know is this right are we go in the
[1:03:26] right direction but when I I I I think
[1:03:28] that we've just focused on talking about
[1:03:30] the Holy Ghost so much it can almost
[1:03:33] seem like it's too much and I know the
[1:03:34] devil will come around and tell me yep
[1:03:36] it's just too much the people have heard
[1:03:38] it you got to move on you got to find
[1:03:39] something else but I have the spirit of
[1:03:42] God say but wait a second think about
[1:03:44] this just follow my leadership here and
[1:03:48] and when I read something like this I
[1:03:49] just think it's so
[1:03:51] beautiful he says let us go and talk
[1:03:55] about the per perfected things now you
[1:03:57] are perfected in God when you're sealed
[1:03:59] by the Holy Ghost until the day of your
[1:04:01] Redemption and we know Hebrews chap 6
[1:04:03] verse one says therefore leaving the
[1:04:05] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:04:07] us go on to Perfection amen let's not be
[1:04:10] worried about churchianity and doing all
[1:04:13] these things all of the Traditions the
[1:04:16] rudiments of of Christianity there comes
[1:04:19] a point in time where we've already done
[1:04:20] that and we need to move on brothers and
[1:04:22] sisters we know that John he was on the
[1:04:25] aisle of Pat was for the testimony of
[1:04:26] Jesus Christ and he was given an
[1:04:29] opportunity to come higher there was a
[1:04:31] door open in heaven for him and it's no
[1:04:33] different for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:35] the only thing is we're not seeing a a
[1:04:37] doorway in heaven we're not seeing a
[1:04:40] doorway anywhere except for Jesus Christ
[1:04:42] who said I am the way the truth and the
[1:04:45] life nobody comes onto the father except
[1:04:47] by me so where is he
[1:04:50] today we know he's in a word his word is
[1:04:54] our doorway
[1:04:56] into that higher
[1:04:58] Revelation but let's go on to perfected
[1:05:00] things now he says you're perfected in
[1:05:03] God when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] until the day of your Redemption he
[1:05:06] that's born of God first John does not
[1:05:07] commit sin for he cannot sin for the
[1:05:11] seed of God remains in him you cannot
[1:05:15] actually ever escape it if you are truly
[1:05:17] a son and daughter of God and you never
[1:05:20] really want to if you are a son and
[1:05:23] daughter of God but brother Bram he goes
[1:05:26] on to
[1:05:27] explaining the answer to this question
[1:05:30] please explain Hebrews 6: 4
[1:05:34] to8 for it's impossible for those who
[1:05:37] were once enlightened have tasted of the
[1:05:39] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:05:41] the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost my and have tasted the good word
[1:05:46] of God and the powers of the world to
[1:05:48] come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:05:52] them again to repentance seeing they
[1:05:55] crucified if to themselves the Son of
[1:05:57] God aresh and put him to an open
[1:06:02] shame brother Bram talks about a vision
[1:06:06] about Dr Davis and it's much later in
[1:06:08] the message and I'm just going to sort
[1:06:10] of Hit the highlights with this so that
[1:06:12] we can carry on I apologize brother
[1:06:14] Logan it's a little bit uh scattered
[1:06:17] maybe it seems but just bear with
[1:06:20] me
[1:06:23] um you could look up I said said wonder
[1:06:26] what that
[1:06:28] means I don't know if this uh was part
[1:06:31] of what I gave you this morning and I
[1:06:33] apologize but here we
[1:06:36] are brother bradam he says I wondered
[1:06:39] what that
[1:06:40] means brother Bram he he
[1:06:44] took he he he had a vision and and I
[1:06:49] think he talked to Brother Davis about
[1:06:51] this Brother Davis was actually mocking
[1:06:53] brother Bram and and and he went away to
[1:06:57] pray for Brother Davis he went up to his
[1:06:59] cave in in Greens Mill and we're all
[1:07:01] familiar with that he went away to
[1:07:04] actually pray for this man Brother Davis
[1:07:07] and brother branam he says it's
[1:07:09] paragraph 192 in in the app here he says
[1:07:11] I said I wonder what that means I just
[1:07:14] now I wasn't thinking about nothing up
[1:07:16] there I just that I and just then as I
[1:07:20] was sitting there I thought the Lord
[1:07:22] would give me a vision about Brother
[1:07:24] Davis and them down there and I was
[1:07:27] sitting there I looked and I seen
[1:07:29] something turning out across the hollow
[1:07:31] in front of me and it was a wh turning
[1:07:35] and I seen it was all broke up just
[1:07:37] looked like it was all plowed over and a
[1:07:41] man went forth with a great big thing in
[1:07:45] front of him full of seed and he was
[1:07:48] casting the seed all the way across the
[1:07:51] Earth as he went and he went around the
[1:07:54] curvature of the Earth and he went out
[1:07:56] of my
[1:07:58] sight and as soon as he went out of my
[1:08:01] sight here come a man real sneaky
[1:08:04] looking dressed in black garments going
[1:08:08] around like this
[1:08:11] going throwing bad
[1:08:14] seeds and I watched
[1:08:16] it and as the Earth kept turning
[1:08:21] around goes on to say after while wheat
[1:08:25] come up
[1:08:26] and when the wheat come up of there come
[1:08:29] briers and thistles and thorns and
[1:08:32] stinkweed and everything growed up
[1:08:35] growing up milk weeds and everything
[1:08:38] growing up in the wheat think about all
[1:08:41] those different weeds growing in the
[1:08:43] midst of the wheat many times we can
[1:08:47] read these and listen to these and and
[1:08:49] just it just can seem like a a story and
[1:08:52] it's a nice story but I think it's
[1:08:53] interesting how he names off all of
[1:08:56] these different weeds all of these
[1:08:59] different weeds in with the wheat we
[1:09:02] know the vision showed the wheat the
[1:09:04] good man sowing the wheat in the field
[1:09:06] but then suddenly this other man comes
[1:09:08] along and sews all these different
[1:09:11] kinds and we know it's confusion because
[1:09:15] something happens and then they all
[1:09:16] Sprout up but the BAM says and they was
[1:09:19] all growing together and there come a
[1:09:21] real bad Dro and the little wheat had
[1:09:24] its head over like that and the little
[1:09:27] Brier and Thistle and thorns and they
[1:09:30] had their head over each weed just pant
[1:09:33] pant pant breathing like
[1:09:35] that excuse me you could just hear them
[1:09:39] and they were calling for
[1:09:42] rain and after a while Along come a
[1:09:46] great big cloud and I think I could just
[1:09:49] preach on that for a while after a while
[1:09:53] Along come a great big CL loud how many
[1:09:56] different Wheats and weeds were crying
[1:10:01] for rain since the day of Pentecost
[1:10:03] brothers and
[1:10:06] sisters after a while come a a great big
[1:10:10] cloud and the water just gushed down and
[1:10:13] when it fell upon there that wheat
[1:10:15] jumped up and began to holler Glory
[1:10:18] Hallelujah praise the Lord up jumped the
[1:10:21] little stinkweed and hollered Glory
[1:10:24] praise the the Lord hallelujah all the
[1:10:27] thorns and all of them dancing all
[1:10:30] around over the field hollering Glory
[1:10:33] Hallelujah praise the
[1:10:34] Lord isn't it beautiful the way that he
[1:10:37] portrays this the way that he brings
[1:10:39] this because first it was the wheat it
[1:10:42] wasn't second right the stink weed
[1:10:45] didn't rise up and start praising God
[1:10:47] first it was the wheat right we know
[1:10:49] there's always a carnal impersonation of
[1:10:52] the truth and there's no way there can
[1:10:54] be an impersonation unless there is a
[1:10:58] truth the only way there's a counterfeit
[1:11:00] is for there to be a real he goes on to
[1:11:03] say well I said I can't get that the
[1:11:05] vision left me then I fell back on that
[1:11:08] again the Briars which is nigh unto
[1:11:09] rejection then I got it Jesus said the
[1:11:12] rain falls on the just and the
[1:11:15] unjust a man can sit in the
[1:11:18] meeting can speak with tongues can shout
[1:11:22] and act just like the rest of them
[1:11:26] now this one is tricky with the real
[1:11:29] genuine Holy Ghost and still not be in
[1:11:33] the kingdom of God right
[1:11:36] amen now remember we're talking about
[1:11:39] this person's question I believe it's
[1:11:42] number 100 in questions and
[1:11:44] answers on the questions and answers of
[1:11:47] the Holy Ghost paragraph 100 but it's
[1:11:50] it's the question is please explain the
[1:11:52] meaning of Hebrews 6: vers 4 to 8 it's
[1:11:58] impossible for those who were once
[1:12:01] enlightened they can have the Holy Ghost
[1:12:03] anointing and still not be in the
[1:12:05] kingdom of God that's exactly right
[1:12:06] Jesus didn't Jesus say many will stand
[1:12:08] in that day and say Lord have not I cast
[1:12:11] out devils in your name have not I
[1:12:14] prophesied preached in your name have
[1:12:16] not I done Mighty works in your name do
[1:12:21] you see the the theme there have not I
[1:12:25] have not I have not I there ain't no I
[1:12:30] in it brothers and sisters it's all him
[1:12:33] as soon as we try putting I in there
[1:12:36] that's where we stop the power of the
[1:12:38] Lord right yes the Holy Ghost steps back
[1:12:41] and says hey it's you go for it call me
[1:12:45] when you're ready I'll just be on the
[1:12:46] tree branch up here resting but more
[1:12:49] than likely he'll just be dealing with
[1:12:51] someone else who wants him to be there
[1:12:53] says that's exactly right didn't Jesus
[1:12:55] say many will stand in that day say Lord
[1:12:57] have not I cast out devils in your name
[1:12:58] have not I prophesied preached in your
[1:13:00] name I love how he says that prophesied
[1:13:03] preached in your name not just a prophet
[1:13:05] prophesying with their eyes closed
[1:13:07] prophesying Great and Mighty things
[1:13:09] maybe even little things somebody
[1:13:11] preaching in his name
[1:13:15] my have not I done Mighty works in your
[1:13:18] name Jesus said depart from me you
[1:13:21] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[1:13:25] how about that he says that's where
[1:13:28] brother Barry says brothers and sisters
[1:13:29] get to Christ get the baptism of the
[1:13:32] Holy Ghost in your life so you don't
[1:13:34] stand there on that day and say but Lord
[1:13:36] have not I didn't I don't you see what I
[1:13:39] did can't you see my
[1:13:41] legacy he's going to say I never even
[1:13:44] knew you yes sir you didn't have a you
[1:13:47] chose not to have you literally chose
[1:13:50] not to have a personal relationship with
[1:13:52] me so I don't even know you
[1:13:56] brothers and sisters the word no in the
[1:13:57] Bible is intimacy it's taking it to the
[1:14:00] next
[1:14:01] level having nothing between you and him
[1:14:05] husband and wife becoming one amen
[1:14:09] that's the requirement for our age we
[1:14:11] can't just come up to the borderline and
[1:14:14] say oh my there it is that's the Holy
[1:14:18] Ghost that's the promised land but I
[1:14:21] like the life that I live I'm just going
[1:14:23] to stay right here on this side
[1:14:25] you know what the word of God says that
[1:14:27] there's people that did that the
[1:14:29] children of Israel two tribes and their
[1:14:31] names were blotted out from under
[1:14:37] Heaven it doesn't mean that they were
[1:14:39] blotted out in
[1:14:41] heaven but the word of God says that
[1:14:43] their names were blotted out from under
[1:14:45] Heaven because they chose to stay back
[1:14:48] and not go all the way what happened was
[1:14:51] they got tied up in the world brother
[1:14:53] Brandon brings us out real clear in the
[1:14:55] message and you'd have to look it up I'm
[1:14:56] just going to preach now now we're going
[1:14:58] to get into the service but what they
[1:15:00] did was they got tied up with money they
[1:15:02] got tied up with politics baac and balum
[1:15:05] they got tied up in looking at the
[1:15:06] hinder parts of people and what happened
[1:15:09] they forfeited their their
[1:15:11] power for their programs they said we're
[1:15:14] going to do it our way we're not going
[1:15:16] to follow the leadership of the Prophet
[1:15:17] anymore and that's literally what
[1:15:19] happened they said we're not going to
[1:15:20] follow the leadership of the Prophet
[1:15:22] anymore how many people in our day would
[1:15:24] say that I'm just going to do it my way
[1:15:26] I'm not going to follow the leadership
[1:15:27] of the
[1:15:28] Prophet he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:30] yesterday today and forever we're not
[1:15:33] going to be able to make excuses on that
[1:15:34] day and say but Lord I but Lord I didn't
[1:15:38] I he's going to say depart from me you
[1:15:42] worker of iniquity you knew better and
[1:15:44] you didn't do it you knew what to do but
[1:15:47] you chose not
[1:15:51] to that's why brothers and sisters I
[1:15:53] have to preach it this way
[1:15:55] we've got to get into Christ that's the
[1:15:57] only way truth and life the holy ghost
[1:16:00] or bust for us to be here partaking of
[1:16:04] this heavenly word of this heavenly gift
[1:16:07] it will be impossible for us who were
[1:16:10] once enlightened to ever redeem
[1:16:14] ourselves to ever go back it would be
[1:16:17] better in the word of God for us to
[1:16:19] never have known about this
[1:16:21] word than to have come right up to the
[1:16:24] edge and looked over and said my
[1:16:26] goodness it is true there are there are
[1:16:30] streams of milk and there are hives of
[1:16:32] honey and there's pomegranates and and
[1:16:34] bunches of grapes that they have have to
[1:16:37] carry with two men and there's
[1:16:39] pomegranates and there's figs oh my but
[1:16:43] we know what the problem was we'll get
[1:16:45] into this what they did was they started
[1:16:48] to look at all the natural elements they
[1:16:51] started to look at the Giants in the
[1:16:52] land they looked at the wild City they
[1:16:55] looked at all the different things even
[1:16:57] after God took them out of bondage they
[1:16:59] saw all the signs and wonders all the
[1:17:01] mighty
[1:17:04] Miracles but because 10 men said it the
[1:17:07] majority went with them well most of the
[1:17:09] men are saying this so we must go with
[1:17:11] them right we know the whole
[1:17:13] congregation two two two and and almost
[1:17:16] a half million people picked up stones
[1:17:18] to throw at Caleb and
[1:17:20] Joshua when they said we're more than
[1:17:22] able to God said we can do it what's the
[1:17:25] problem here right but we know that they
[1:17:28] were different weren't they yes they
[1:17:31] were there was something different about
[1:17:33] those boys wasn't there now some people
[1:17:36] will say that the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:17:38] given yet so they can't have the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost but I want to say they had the
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost because the word of God says
[1:17:43] they were of another
[1:17:45] spirit and he's the same yesterday today
[1:17:48] and forever you can't take him and cut
[1:17:49] him up and give them to a Believer it's
[1:17:51] either God or it's
[1:17:53] not they had an anointing they had the
[1:17:56] Holy Ghost in their life they had
[1:17:58] something driving them to the word of
[1:17:59] God and they weren't interested in
[1:18:01] anybody's opinion they weren't
[1:18:03] interested in committees and and
[1:18:05] theories and and the Deeds of the
[1:18:06] nicians they wanted nothing to do with
[1:18:08] any of it they said we're more than able
[1:18:10] God brought us out of bondage he
[1:18:12] promised us this land and he's given us
[1:18:14] this land it's right there and now
[1:18:16] you're going to Chick it out you're
[1:18:18] going to say that God isn't able to do
[1:18:20] it Lord have
[1:18:23] mercy
[1:18:27] brother Bram in in paragraph 168 he says
[1:18:29] a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:32] not thans he's filled this is where I
[1:18:34] just want to harp on it and I know I've
[1:18:35] harped on it I'm going to continue to
[1:18:36] harp on it know that you've got the Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost brothers and sisters brother
[1:18:40] bradam we read it last week or the week
[1:18:41] before he said it's not just an option
[1:18:43] it's not just optional to say maybe one
[1:18:45] of these days I'll get the Holy Ghost in
[1:18:47] my life and if I do if I don't it'll be
[1:18:49] okay I'll just come to church and
[1:18:50] everything will be fine my parents have
[1:18:52] the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters
[1:18:54] everything is we can live off the
[1:18:56] experience of our brothers and our
[1:18:57] sisters and things will be good for us
[1:18:58] here but we want to know that when we
[1:19:00] get there brother Bram tells a story
[1:19:02] about that man that brother who said I
[1:19:04] want to fix it up here I don't want to
[1:19:06] get down to the river where I got to
[1:19:07] cross that River Jordan and die and go
[1:19:09] into that Promised Land into eternity
[1:19:12] and and maybe have trouble I want to fix
[1:19:14] it up now I want to know
[1:19:18] now a man that's filled with the Holy
[1:19:21] Ghost not thinks he's filled but he
[1:19:23] that's born of the the spirit of God
[1:19:25] does not commit sin for the seed of God
[1:19:28] is in him and he cannot sin
[1:19:32] see does the bible say that so there it
[1:19:36] is you are not what you
[1:19:39] do what is what
[1:19:42] not excuse me what the world thinks of
[1:19:47] you and I just want to say it's not even
[1:19:50] what we think of us we've got to be
[1:19:53] willing to actually look ourselves in
[1:19:55] the eye and say everything that I see
[1:19:57] with my eye is a lying
[1:20:00] vanity we know that that Jonah found
[1:20:03] himself in the belly of the whale right
[1:20:06] and what did he say brother bradam says
[1:20:08] it I never heard anybody else say it
[1:20:10] this way when he looked this way he saw
[1:20:12] whale belly and when he looked this way
[1:20:14] he saw whale belly and that way and that
[1:20:17] way and that way and that way all he saw
[1:20:19] was whale belly yes but he said I'm not
[1:20:22] looking at these that I see with my eyes
[1:20:25] these are lying vanities I am going to
[1:20:28] look towards the Temple of the most high
[1:20:32] God because he is
[1:20:36] God does the bible say that so there it
[1:20:38] is you're not what you do not what is
[1:20:41] what not what the world thinks of you
[1:20:43] it's what God thinks of you see amen you
[1:20:48] cannot how can I have an order written
[1:20:52] by the mayor of the city that I can run
[1:20:54] 40 m an hour through the city and any
[1:20:56] policeman arrests me I can't how can I
[1:20:59] sin when there's a blood offering before
[1:21:02] God constantly where he can't even see
[1:21:05] me when there's a bumper on on bumper
[1:21:08] before me on before me and God a shield
[1:21:13] of blood for we are dead and our life is
[1:21:17] hid in Christ through God sealed by the
[1:21:19] Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost how in the world can you do
[1:21:23] anything wrong in the sight of
[1:21:26] God that's why we can look at Romans
[1:21:29] chapter 7 and say my if I just keep
[1:21:31] looking at myself I'm going to say what
[1:21:32] a vile man I am oh my there's no way
[1:21:35] that I could ever overcome I could never
[1:21:37] live this message of the hour so I might
[1:21:39] as well just go and eat and drink and be
[1:21:41] merry because tomorrow I'm just going to
[1:21:42] die like everybody else all of those are
[1:21:45] just lying vanities though brothers and
[1:21:47] sisters flip the page go to Romans
[1:21:49] chapter 8 because the word of God says
[1:21:51] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:21:53] to those who are in Christ who walk not
[1:21:56] after this flesh I don't look at this
[1:21:58] flesh I don't look at your flesh I look
[1:22:00] at the spirit I look at the word of God
[1:22:03] I want to see him manifest in my life
[1:22:06] amen if we're living there brothers and
[1:22:08] sisters I want to tell you today it is
[1:22:10] impossible for you to sin Hallelujah
[1:22:15] because what is
[1:22:17] sin what is
[1:22:19] sin it's
[1:22:21] unbelief how many unbelievers are there
[1:22:23] here today that don't believe this word
[1:22:25] of
[1:22:26] God not one hand right Hallelujah we
[1:22:30] believe this word of
[1:22:32] God so I want to say to you today you
[1:22:34] can't
[1:22:35] sin we're going to trip up and fall flat
[1:22:38] on our face we heard it last Sunday amen
[1:22:41] but that's what God wants am he doesn't
[1:22:44] want to see us hurt he doesn't want to
[1:22:45] see us down he wants to see us crying
[1:22:48] unto him saying lord I can't do this I
[1:22:50] need you to do this for me amen
[1:22:53] hallelujah we get to the place where we
[1:22:55] get over ourselves and stop the lying
[1:22:58] vanity in the mirror thinking that I'm
[1:23:00] good for anything this flesh is fit for
[1:23:05] Destruction only his spirit will make it
[1:23:08] brothers and
[1:23:10] sisters we know that he goes on to say
[1:23:13] if we sin willfully Hebrews chapter 10
[1:23:15] after we receive the knowledge of the
[1:23:17] truth there is no more sacrifice for sin
[1:23:22] and here it's impossible see to sin
[1:23:27] willfully and you know if we get the
[1:23:29] Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[1:23:30] sisters it is impossible for you to sin
[1:23:34] willfully because even though you're
[1:23:36] going to be tempted and you're going to
[1:23:38] be tried you're going to do this and
[1:23:40] you're going to fail at that you're
[1:23:41] going to have all these different things
[1:23:42] in your life that you're going to be
[1:23:44] able to look at and other people are
[1:23:45] going to be able to look at they're
[1:23:46] going to be able to point at you're
[1:23:47] going to know that these things have
[1:23:48] happened in your life that doesn't mean
[1:23:49] you don't believe the word of God does
[1:23:51] it amen right but to willfully say I
[1:23:54] don't believe all that brother bradam
[1:23:57] said I don't believe all about this
[1:24:01] Prophet I don't believe all about the
[1:24:03] cloud in 1963 I I don't believe all
[1:24:07] about the seals I I I don't believe I
[1:24:10] can't just believe that it's all about
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost if we get to that place
[1:24:14] brothers and sisters what happens is we
[1:24:16] get our conscience our spiritual
[1:24:17] conscience burned over seared with a hot
[1:24:20] iron and you know what God says in the
[1:24:22] word that he'll give you over to a
[1:24:23] reprobate mind where you won't even be
[1:24:25] able to hear it anymore and we know that
[1:24:28] his Prophet said there's a a different
[1:24:30] description of that where if you re
[1:24:32] refuse refuse the the blast from the
[1:24:35] trumpet of Jubilee where you can be free
[1:24:37] completely free and and from the worst
[1:24:40] enemy of all yourself if you want if you
[1:24:43] receive that trumpet blast that Jubilee
[1:24:46] trumpet and and if you refuse it what
[1:24:48] happens is you're taken down to the
[1:24:50] temple not just your home but to the
[1:24:52] temple and you're pierced through in
[1:24:54] your ear with an all to identify that
[1:24:57] you are now a slave forever and brother
[1:25:00] bradam says that's not just in the Earl
[1:25:03] in the flesh it's in the eardrum of the
[1:25:05] spirit so you'll never be able to hear
[1:25:07] the word of God anymore and that's God
[1:25:10] giving you over to a reprobate mind not
[1:25:12] because he forced you to do it because
[1:25:14] you chose not
[1:25:17] to amen amen but I love how brother Ram
[1:25:21] talks about this paragraph 169 now it's
[1:25:24] starting to get real good here now he
[1:25:26] says now let's go ahead and read all
[1:25:28] right Perfection not laying again the
[1:25:30] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:25:33] and Faith towards god of the doctrine of
[1:25:36] baptisms laying on of hands and of the
[1:25:39] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:25:41] judgment and this we do if God permit
[1:25:46] now here's where they wanted to start
[1:25:49] from the fourth verse for it's
[1:25:51] impossible for those once enlightened
[1:25:53] and have tasted of the heaven gift who
[1:25:54] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:56] and have tasted of the good word of God
[1:25:58] and of the powers of the world to come
[1:26:01] if they shall fall away to
[1:26:04] renew renew them again unto repentance
[1:26:09] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:26:11] Son of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:26:16] shame we don't ever want to go up to
[1:26:19] that place and turn around brothers and
[1:26:22] sisters you know let's just turn over to
[1:26:26] numbers chter
[1:26:28] 12 as I was studying this I just started
[1:26:31] to think about some of these things and
[1:26:35] amen the children of Israel were brought
[1:26:38] out from
[1:26:49] bondage they were brought out from the
[1:26:52] curse that was upon them
[1:26:54] 430
[1:26:56] years they were in
[1:27:00] bondage God had sent them a deliverer
[1:27:03] they were out in the
[1:27:05] wilderness and the
[1:27:08] Believers my Bible says at the top here
[1:27:10] I don't know what you call the word in
[1:27:12] the middle at the top it says
[1:27:14] dissension
[1:27:16] dissension Numbers chapter
[1:27:19] 12 verse one and Miriam and Aaron
[1:27:24] spake against
[1:27:26] Moses because of the Ethiopian woman who
[1:27:29] he had
[1:27:31] married for he had married an Ethiopian
[1:27:36] woman and they said hath the Lord indeed
[1:27:38] spoken only by
[1:27:40] Moses hath he not spoken also by
[1:27:46] us now you can tell by the way this is
[1:27:50] written that they weren't speaking to
[1:27:53] Moses they were having a private
[1:27:55] conversation weren't they but isn't it
[1:27:57] interesting here what the private
[1:27:59] conversation equates to the very next
[1:28:03] sentence is and the Lord heard
[1:28:07] it our private conversations are are
[1:28:10] private from other human beings but you
[1:28:13] know brothers and sisters I think many
[1:28:14] times it might be better for us to have
[1:28:16] a conversation that's private with other
[1:28:18] human beings and have other people's
[1:28:20] feelings get hurt because God's
[1:28:22] listening all the time amen and some of
[1:28:25] these private conversations brothers and
[1:28:27] sisters bring dissension and you know
[1:28:29] what dissension we're talking about is
[1:28:31] getting out of order from the word of
[1:28:33] God out of order from the way the
[1:28:35] prophet brought things in our
[1:28:37] day we we'll carry on here now the man
[1:28:41] Moses was very Meek above all the men
[1:28:43] which were on the face of the earth and
[1:28:45] the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses and
[1:28:48] unto Aaron can you imagine what that
[1:28:50] would be like suddenly unto Moses and
[1:28:53] unto Aaron
[1:28:54] and unto Miriam come out ye three unto
[1:28:57] the Tabernacle of the
[1:28:59] congregation and they three came out and
[1:29:01] the Lord came down in the pillar of the
[1:29:03] cloud and stood in the door of the
[1:29:06] Tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam
[1:29:09] and they both came forth and he said
[1:29:11] hear now my
[1:29:14] words my if there be a prophet among you
[1:29:17] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[1:29:21] him in a vision and will speak unto him
[1:29:24] in a
[1:29:25] dream my servant Moses is not so who is
[1:29:30] faithful in all mine house with him will
[1:29:33] I speak mouth to mouth even apparently
[1:29:37] and not in dark
[1:29:38] speeches and the similitude of the Lord
[1:29:41] shall be shall he behold wherefore then
[1:29:45] were ye not afraid to speak against my
[1:29:49] servant
[1:29:52] Moses and the next next verse and the
[1:29:55] anger of the Lord was kindled against
[1:29:57] them and he
[1:29:59] departed I I just this just about
[1:30:02] floored me when I was thinking about
[1:30:03] this could you imagine knowing that the
[1:30:05] anger of the Lord was kindled against
[1:30:08] you and he departs from you you don't
[1:30:11] even get a chance to repent to say I'm
[1:30:13] sorry Lord but we know this is for a
[1:30:17] purpose he did not want to have them
[1:30:20] apologize to him he wanted them to
[1:30:23] actually go to his servant and
[1:30:26] apologize because he actually slandered
[1:30:29] they actually slandered his servant amen
[1:30:33] it's just like husbands and wives we can
[1:30:35] bring our sacrifice to the Lord and and
[1:30:38] and thank the Lord and and give praise
[1:30:40] to the Lord and apologize to the Lord
[1:30:41] for what I did to my wife and God's
[1:30:44] going to say hey you never did it to me
[1:30:47] I understand your heart but you did it
[1:30:49] to her you've got to go apologize to
[1:30:52] her so just leave your your sacrifice
[1:30:56] here of praise and worship and whatever
[1:30:58] else it is and just leave it here and go
[1:31:01] make it right with your wife and then
[1:31:02] come back and then I'll receive your
[1:31:04] worship yes sir but many times we just
[1:31:07] want to do it our way we don't want to
[1:31:09] do that harder work but the anger of the
[1:31:12] Lord was kindled against them and he
[1:31:14] departed and the cloud departed from off
[1:31:17] the Tabernacle and behold Miriam became
[1:31:19] leprous white as snow and Aaron looked
[1:31:22] upon Miriam and behold told she was
[1:31:25] leprous and you know what leprous means
[1:31:29] unbelief it's a type of unbelief brother
[1:31:31] brandham brings it very clearly in the
[1:31:33] message I'm not going to go too far into
[1:31:35] that but just to make it clear she was
[1:31:37] demonstrating absolute unbelief at that
[1:31:40] moment and her husband actually saw
[1:31:45] it the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:31:47] against them and he departed my and
[1:31:50] Aaron said unto Moses alas my Lord I
[1:31:53] beseech thee not the sin Upon Us wherein
[1:31:55] we have done foolishly and wherein we
[1:31:57] have sinned let her not be as one dead
[1:32:01] of whom the flesh is half consumed when
[1:32:05] he cometh out of his mother's womb and
[1:32:07] Moses Cried unto the Lord saying heal
[1:32:09] her now oh Lord or oh God I beseech thee
[1:32:13] and the Lord said unto Moses if her
[1:32:15] father had but spit in her face should
[1:32:19] she not be ashamed seven days let her be
[1:32:23] shut out from the Camp seven days and
[1:32:25] after that let her be received in
[1:32:28] again and Miriam was shut out from the
[1:32:31] camp seven days and the people journeyed
[1:32:33] not till Miriam was brought in again I
[1:32:36] just can't help but think brothers and
[1:32:38] sisters we ought to be very careful with
[1:32:40] our discussions with our conversations
[1:32:43] in private because we think it's in
[1:32:45] private and we can just say whatever we
[1:32:47] want you can but God's listening he's
[1:32:50] hearing you and you know what we're
[1:32:52] going to actually create our future by
[1:32:54] the words that we speak we're living in
[1:32:56] the third pole generation brothers and
[1:32:58] sisters this is no time to play church
[1:33:00] this is no time to play around we're
[1:33:03] living in a time that that the whole
[1:33:05] entire world has waited for all of the
[1:33:08] sages and Prophets desired even angels
[1:33:10] desired to look upon the things that we
[1:33:12] just take for granted in the message of
[1:33:14] the
[1:33:16] hour all paragraph 170 out of questions
[1:33:20] and answers brother bradam he says now
[1:33:23] now that look like from the way that
[1:33:25] you're reading it there that a man could
[1:33:28] receive the Holy Ghost and then
[1:33:30] backslide and be
[1:33:33] lost but it's impossible for him to do
[1:33:36] it see he can't do it amen if he did
[1:33:41] Christ lied
[1:33:42] see it's impossible for those once
[1:33:47] enlightened
[1:33:49] period now watch here what's he speaking
[1:33:52] to he's speaking to those borderline
[1:33:57] Jews he never said a man being filled
[1:33:59] with the Holy
[1:34:01] Ghost he said if he has tasted the word
[1:34:04] of God
[1:34:07] right tasted the word of
[1:34:10] God paragraph 171 he says now let me
[1:34:13] just give it in a parabolic so that
[1:34:15] you'll see and won't miss it now now
[1:34:18] he's writing to these Jews some of them
[1:34:20] are borderline Believers see he said now
[1:34:24] we're going to leave these works and go
[1:34:26] on to talk about perfection said now
[1:34:28] we're talking about baptisms and
[1:34:30] resurrection of the dead and laying on
[1:34:31] of hands and everything but let's go
[1:34:33] already let's go ahead now to talk about
[1:34:36] perfection now we're going to talk about
[1:34:39] when you come into the Holy Ghost I love
[1:34:42] it how he just brings it right down now
[1:34:43] let's explain this now you've been
[1:34:47] hanging around the meeting a long time
[1:34:50] and you've seen those people they'll
[1:34:52] stay around
[1:34:54] they won't come in or go out they'll
[1:34:57] appreciate the Holy Ghost they'll come
[1:35:00] around and maybe the Holy Ghost do
[1:35:02] something and and Men they'll get up and
[1:35:04] jump and shout and and and and jump up
[1:35:09] and down the floor about it but they
[1:35:11] never want to receive it themselves no
[1:35:14] no see and they'll say oh yes that's
[1:35:17] good oh I don't know about that now see
[1:35:21] borderline believers just so close till
[1:35:25] they can taste it but yet they don't
[1:35:27] receive it
[1:35:29] see now they're hanging around like that
[1:35:32] so long till after a
[1:35:34] while they drift completely
[1:35:37] away and you know brothers and sisters I
[1:35:40] I guess I just felt led to preach this
[1:35:42] because we know that there's three kinds
[1:35:44] of Believers everywhere you go and it's
[1:35:47] important for us to know that we need to
[1:35:49] get into Christ Jesus amen don't be a
[1:35:51] borderline believer right don't be the
[1:35:54] one that says well I it works for me and
[1:35:57] I can just be this way because we know
[1:36:00] we're going to come to that place where
[1:36:01] we meet him face to face one day and
[1:36:03] we're going to say but Lord I and he's
[1:36:06] going to say no no no no no I I'm the
[1:36:10] one that did it but you chose to refuse
[1:36:12] the way that I provided in your
[1:36:15] day we know that in uh in the book of
[1:36:19] Exodus the children of
[1:36:22] Israel they had called and called and
[1:36:25] called for a deliverer when they were in
[1:36:28] Egypt and we know that God he finally
[1:36:32] called a
[1:36:33] deliverer one of their own we know the
[1:36:35] whole story very well he met him in the
[1:36:37] in the wilderness in in a burning bush
[1:36:41] and he came down and said to Moses in
[1:36:43] the wilderness I am come down to deliver
[1:36:46] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:36:49] and to bring them up out of that land
[1:36:51] into unto a good land and large unto a
[1:36:55] land flowing with milk and honey unto
[1:36:57] the place of the Canaanites and the
[1:36:59] Hittites and the amorites and the
[1:37:00] perizzites and the hivites and the
[1:37:03] jebusites all of the IES are going to be
[1:37:07] there it's not going to be just an empty
[1:37:09] vacant building or an empty vacant city
[1:37:14] it's going to be busy there there's
[1:37:15] going to be people there he didn't
[1:37:17] change his word one bit he told them
[1:37:19] that all of these people are going to be
[1:37:21] there these inhabitants of the land are
[1:37:23] going to be be there and and you need to
[1:37:25] go forwards and and you know I just
[1:37:28] think it's interesting to look at it
[1:37:29] maybe from a different perspective once
[1:37:30] the children of Israel did come out from
[1:37:33] bondage and as they did Journey Into the
[1:37:35] Wilderness now they're free two and a
[1:37:36] half million strong brother brandom said
[1:37:38] here they are and they come up to the
[1:37:40] Red Sea and and they find that they
[1:37:42] can't go across and they find that
[1:37:44] there's a mountain behind them and now
[1:37:46] brother Bram he says that they got their
[1:37:47] back up against the wall and oh my now
[1:37:50] they can see Pharaoh coming Pharaoh has
[1:37:52] changed his heart again and now he's
[1:37:54] coming after them and this time he's not
[1:37:56] going to come and try and take them back
[1:37:58] they know he's going to come and kill
[1:38:00] them now they're back is up against the
[1:38:02] wall oh no what are they going to do and
[1:38:04] we know that that Moses even started to
[1:38:06] tremble he started to get nervous and
[1:38:08] upset and cried out to God and God said
[1:38:10] have you not seen all of these signs and
[1:38:13] wonders all the way along what are you
[1:38:15] crying to me for speak the word and go
[1:38:19] forwards the point I want to get to
[1:38:21] brothers and sisters is we know the
[1:38:24] children of Israel they crossed the Red
[1:38:26] Sea they crossed the Red Sea on dry
[1:38:30] ground they weren't walking across those
[1:38:32] rocks at the bottom the sand at the
[1:38:34] bottom and slipping and sliding they
[1:38:36] weren't going on their Journey having an
[1:38:38] experience with the
[1:38:39] Lord in a slippery treacherous way he
[1:38:43] wasn't going to let them slip and slide
[1:38:46] and have all kinds of tripping and
[1:38:48] falling Maneuvers he gave them Solid
[1:38:51] Rock Solid dry ground to walk on and I
[1:38:55] just can't help but think that's the way
[1:38:56] of a True Believer to get into the Holy
[1:38:58] Ghost to get the Holy Ghost into our
[1:39:00] lives to go all the way into Christ he's
[1:39:03] going to give you a journey on a rock on
[1:39:06] a solid foundation you're not going to
[1:39:08] be slipping and sliding all over the
[1:39:10] place it's not going to be out of
[1:39:11] control in fact it's the other way
[1:39:13] around until you get there you're going
[1:39:15] to be slipping and sliding all over the
[1:39:17] place it's going to be all kinds of
[1:39:19] different problems and issues amen we
[1:39:22] know that when when the children of
[1:39:24] Israel just another one the same same
[1:39:26] Theory when the children of Israel they
[1:39:28] came out and and now they're with Joshua
[1:39:31] they've been in the wilderness a long
[1:39:33] long time we know the story too well
[1:39:36] when they were going to cross over
[1:39:37] Jordan what happened first the Levites
[1:39:40] the priests went forward with the Ark of
[1:39:42] the
[1:39:43] Covenant and what
[1:39:45] happened the Lord stopped the waters on
[1:39:48] the River Jordan and when they were
[1:39:50] crossing over Jordan did their feet get
[1:39:52] wet did they slip and slide were they
[1:39:55] uneasy and insecure did it seem like it
[1:39:58] was too much for them to bear like if
[1:40:00] they got started down that bank into the
[1:40:02] river that it would just they slip and
[1:40:05] fall no it was dry ground once again
[1:40:08] both instances the word of God says dry
[1:40:12] ground and we know that even especially
[1:40:15] with the Book of Joshua where they
[1:40:16] crossed over God said to them I want you
[1:40:19] to take some rocks out of that dry
[1:40:21] ground take some of those dry rocks and
[1:40:23] make make a statute make a a a a make a
[1:40:27] a a covenant make something that your
[1:40:29] children and your children's children
[1:40:31] will be able to look back on and see
[1:40:33] something that is of remembrance for
[1:40:36] them for this time that I provided the
[1:40:38] way for you to cross over to die out
[1:40:41] from yourselves and I just want to say
[1:40:43] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[1:40:44] live on the edge looking there seeing
[1:40:47] the the good fruits of the land we don't
[1:40:49] have to live in a situation where we
[1:40:50] look at our brothers and our sisters and
[1:40:52] say but look at the victory in their
[1:40:54] life my I just can't do it you can have
[1:40:56] the victory in fact I want to say you
[1:40:59] could probably have a victory that would
[1:41:00] encourage that person that already has
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:04] Victory and what happens is it just
[1:41:06] becomes Perpetual we encourage one
[1:41:08] another because we see the spirit of
[1:41:10] Christ Living out through our lives we
[1:41:12] see uh the Holy Spirit living in our
[1:41:14] midst our children see
[1:41:16] it that's probably the most important I
[1:41:19] can't help but think our children need
[1:41:21] to see not borderline believers
[1:41:23] not just so close till they can taste it
[1:41:27] brother bradam he says but they they
[1:41:29] don't receive it many times we can come
[1:41:32] and and taste it we can have good
[1:41:34] meetings we can go to special
[1:41:35] meetings we can go to special meetings
[1:41:38] wherever they are annual special
[1:41:39] meetings and they're tremendous we can
[1:41:41] go to camps and and and they're
[1:41:44] tremendous and why is that brothers and
[1:41:46] sisters I'll tell you why because we put
[1:41:49] behind us our regular lives and we
[1:41:51] actually focus on the moment we know why
[1:41:55] we travel to a camp it's not so that we
[1:41:57] can have a camp experience and say that
[1:42:00] I've had this great Victory and now I'm
[1:42:01] going to come back to real life and
[1:42:02] everything is going to be just as hard
[1:42:03] as it was before I left it's not so that
[1:42:05] we do the up and down thing it's so that
[1:42:07] we can push aside all of our regular
[1:42:09] lives and go and have an experience with
[1:42:11] God am remember the story that brother
[1:42:15] Wang told about the man who came in a
[1:42:17] prayer line I think he was 50 or 60
[1:42:20] years old he came in a prayer line and
[1:42:23] said you know I just want to find the
[1:42:25] Holy Ghost I've been looking for the
[1:42:26] Holy Ghost when I was young I went to a
[1:42:28] camp and I had an experience there was
[1:42:31] like nothing else I've ever experienced
[1:42:33] in my
[1:42:35] life I wanted the Holy Ghost and I was
[1:42:37] praying for the Holy Ghost and the
[1:42:40] minister prayed for me and said go
[1:42:42] confessing and you'll have the Holy
[1:42:44] Ghost and he said I had something
[1:42:46] happened to me that night in that
[1:42:47] meeting and I went home to my people and
[1:42:50] I told them about my experience and what
[1:42:52] did they say oh was just a camp
[1:42:54] experience don't do anything with that
[1:42:57] just put it on the Shelf put it on the
[1:42:59] back burner don't don't get too excited
[1:43:01] now brothers and sisters if this can't
[1:43:04] get us excited what is it in this world
[1:43:06] that can get us excited the Holy Ghost
[1:43:09] living out through us is the greatest
[1:43:11] treasure that we'll ever find that's the
[1:43:12] pearl of great price amen we know this
[1:43:17] this man lived his life 40 years or so
[1:43:19] and actually came in a prayer line with
[1:43:21] brother Wayne and told him this story
[1:43:23] and he had to tell him you know brother
[1:43:25] you had it all along it's just the devil
[1:43:28] trying to tell you and you know how did
[1:43:30] the devil try and tell him this is the
[1:43:33] part I want to get to it was you
[1:43:34] brothers and sisters and you know I want
[1:43:37] to say it this way maybe even through a
[1:43:38] quack druggist brother Bram talks about
[1:43:41] them the ones who are ministers
[1:43:43] ministering the word of God the wrong
[1:43:45] way yes right there's fruit of the
[1:43:49] spirit amen there's definite markers and
[1:43:51] identifications of people filled with
[1:43:53] Holy Ghost don't get in the way of
[1:43:55] people who want to
[1:43:56] Rejoice amen amen don't be a borderline
[1:44:01] believer get into Christ brothers and
[1:44:04] sisters you'll never ever misbehave if
[1:44:06] you get the Holy Ghost in your life do
[1:44:08] you know that do we know that we'll
[1:44:10] never misbehave if we get the Holy Ghost
[1:44:12] in our life because he's never going to
[1:44:14] misbehave am he's a gentleman amen
[1:44:19] remember though the people that came out
[1:44:21] of that Upper Room building the word
[1:44:23] says the word says the acts of the Holy
[1:44:27] Ghost in the apostles says that they
[1:44:30] stumbled like drunk
[1:44:32] people am right we've watched some
[1:44:36] videos of people stumbling like drunk
[1:44:39] people and we've had to tell the
[1:44:41] children I wanted to tell them it's kind
[1:44:42] of what I grew up with with Pentecost it
[1:44:45] is the right anointing brother brandham
[1:44:47] says on the wrong vessels and how do you
[1:44:50] know whether it's the right vessel or
[1:44:51] the wrong vessel the right vessel will
[1:44:53] say amen God sent a prophet Malachi 4
[1:44:55] has been fulfilled Revelations 10:7 is
[1:44:58] definitely true yes indeed they will say
[1:45:01] that that's the true evidence of the
[1:45:03] Holy Ghost In Our Lives everything else
[1:45:05] is false and and you know wasn't it so
[1:45:07] good what brother dawn said we have this
[1:45:09] conception that false is right over here
[1:45:11] and Truth is right over here but truth
[1:45:14] is actually right here right beside
[1:45:17] false one word off is Satan's kingdom
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:24] so brother bradam he says it very
[1:45:26] clearly in this message that it is
[1:45:28] possible for people to come right up to
[1:45:30] the edge of the promised land right up
[1:45:33] to it and and to actually get right
[1:45:36] there and and to see the truth of the
[1:45:41] matter to see the fruits of the spirit
[1:45:44] to see the Holy Ghost but yet not go all
[1:45:49] the
[1:45:50] way we know that the people they tasted
[1:45:53] Those Grapes people tasted the figs and
[1:45:56] the pomegranates they tasted the honey
[1:46:00] and they tasted the milk but what did
[1:46:01] they say oh the sons of anakim are over
[1:46:04] there there's no way that we can go
[1:46:05] we're going to be like grasshoppers in
[1:46:07] their eyes you know we can see
[1:46:08] circumstances in our lives that seem
[1:46:11] insurmountable naturally brothers and
[1:46:13] sisters and that's exactly where God
[1:46:14] wants us he wants us to be in a
[1:46:16] situation where it seems impossible
[1:46:19] right because he's the god of the
[1:46:21] impossible he is the one that will come
[1:46:24] on the scene and blow our
[1:46:26] minds but the only way he's going to do
[1:46:29] that if we s if we simply say I believe
[1:46:33] amen but if we say I can't understand it
[1:46:36] nope I can't see how we can connect the
[1:46:38] dots I don't get
[1:46:39] it I don't know if we're doubting Thomas
[1:46:43] the only way I'll believe it is if I can
[1:46:45] see it you'll never see it it'll be
[1:46:47] right there in front of you and you will
[1:46:49] never be able to see it amen this is the
[1:46:52] God we're dealing with remember those
[1:46:53] disciples they walked with him they sat
[1:46:56] in his meetings they listened to him
[1:46:58] even after the resurrection and while
[1:47:00] they walked down the road complaining we
[1:47:03] thought this was the one this was the
[1:47:04] Messiah oh we're going to be delivered
[1:47:07] and what did he do he drew near to them
[1:47:09] as they were walking and he said what's
[1:47:12] your problem what are you talking about
[1:47:15] why are you so down and they said are
[1:47:17] you a stranger in this land don't you
[1:47:19] know what's going on this man we thought
[1:47:21] Jesus the great prophet oh he's raised
[1:47:24] the Dead He's healed the sick he's
[1:47:25] preached Mighty campaigns he's done all
[1:47:28] these wonderful things but now he's dead
[1:47:31] we thought he was the one and he said
[1:47:34] fools slow of heart not to not believe
[1:47:37] the prophets but fool slow of heart to
[1:47:40] believe what the prophets have said but
[1:47:42] you don't see what's going on right now
[1:47:45] he was the one that was right beside
[1:47:47] them speaking to them but yet they
[1:47:50] didn't know
[1:47:51] it if we have the ability to see it
[1:47:54] brothers and sisters we got every single
[1:47:55] reason to Rejoice we got every single
[1:47:58] reason to shout we got every single
[1:48:00] reason to get out of what we would
[1:48:02] consider to be order in this world in
[1:48:05] which we live in you know we're going to
[1:48:07] get over there brother bradam said it
[1:48:08] it's going to be the loudest Place we've
[1:48:09] ever
[1:48:11] been don't worry about getting out of
[1:48:13] order here the Holy Ghost will never let
[1:48:14] you get out of
[1:48:17] order this might sound like some are
[1:48:20] completely lost you know for it's a
[1:48:22] impossible for those who were once
[1:48:24] enlightened amen but brother Bram says
[1:48:26] it very clearly in this message you can
[1:48:27] never ever be enlightened truly
[1:48:30] enlightened the only way that you'll
[1:48:31] ever be enlightened is by having the
[1:48:33] holy ghost in your
[1:48:35] life but many people some people maybe
[1:48:39] just a few I hope that just maybe barely
[1:48:41] none around here anyways will just come
[1:48:44] to church and will just say I have it my
[1:48:47] way and that's as good as it's ever
[1:48:48] going to get don't try and preach to me
[1:48:50] anything because I'm only ever going to
[1:48:52] do it this way it's the way I've
[1:48:53] resolved we've got to be willing to be
[1:48:56] fluid we've got to be willing to be
[1:48:57] flexible remember what we said last week
[1:48:59] that saying I heard if we're not willing
[1:49:01] to be flexible then we're going to get
[1:49:03] bent out of shape
[1:49:04] am this word of God wasn't sent to make
[1:49:07] us comfortable I remember early on as as
[1:49:11] in this office here saying oh my I just
[1:49:13] don't want to upset people and a brother
[1:49:15] basically shook me and said the word of
[1:49:17] God is not sent to make us feel
[1:49:19] comfortable the word of God is sent to
[1:49:21] shake us up amen it's sent to set us
[1:49:24] straight yes but it might sound like
[1:49:27] some are completely lost because we've
[1:49:29] seen some people who have actually come
[1:49:31] right up to the edge right to the very
[1:49:34] edge and then step
[1:49:37] back I want to say brothers and sisters
[1:49:39] don't ever give up hope don't ever give
[1:49:42] up hope it's not up to us to determine
[1:49:46] who is the wheat and who is the weed
[1:49:48] right and that's the Deeds of the nians
[1:49:51] when they start getting mixed up trying
[1:49:52] to determine who is who it's not right
[1:49:56] don't do it but we all have loved ones I
[1:49:59] know that and some the truth of the
[1:50:03] matter is some might not be very
[1:50:06] elected and that's God's choice that's
[1:50:09] not
[1:50:10] ours right that's why we have to preach
[1:50:13] get the Holy Ghost amen because if
[1:50:16] you're very elected you'll get the Holy
[1:50:18] Ghost you
[1:50:20] will but some just won't be able to go
[1:50:22] all the way but it's not up to us to
[1:50:25] determine what it is up to us to do is
[1:50:27] to live this message amen preaching it
[1:50:30] is one thing but brothers and sisters
[1:50:32] let's live it let's not let one corrupt
[1:50:36] communication come out of our mouth like
[1:50:38] the word of God
[1:50:40] says that's what the word says right we
[1:50:43] agree on that not to let any corrupt
[1:50:45] communication come forth out of our
[1:50:48] mouths doesn't matter whether it's
[1:50:51] doesn't say there's an exclusion there's
[1:50:52] a what note we just need to go and look
[1:50:53] this up and say well unless you're alone
[1:50:55] unless you're in a car unless there's
[1:50:56] nobody else around it's okay you can
[1:50:58] have the conversation no let no corrupt
[1:51:01] communication come
[1:51:03] forwards how do the children of Israel
[1:51:06] wind up laying their carcasses down in
[1:51:08] the wilderness because they started to
[1:51:10] murmur against God but they weren't
[1:51:13] saying oh this God he's a terrible God I
[1:51:16] can't stand this God what they did was
[1:51:18] they murmured about the man God chose to
[1:51:20] put before them
[1:51:23] amen and it was murmuring where he said
[1:51:25] you know what enough I'm done their
[1:51:27] carcasses you know unless you're
[1:51:29] 21 or younger all of your carcasses are
[1:51:32] going to fall in the wilderness you're
[1:51:33] going to wander until you die and that's
[1:51:36] that you will not inherit This Promise
[1:51:40] Land some of our loved ones they may not
[1:51:42] be very elected and it's not up to us to
[1:51:44] determine
[1:51:45] that but it's up to us to live this
[1:51:48] message to its fullest brothers and
[1:51:49] sisters amen talk is cheap but our words
[1:51:54] will never be able to live up to the
[1:51:56] speed in which we live it's up to us to
[1:51:59] speak according to this word it's up to
[1:52:02] us to live according to this word it's
[1:52:04] up to us to encourage as many as we can
[1:52:08] according to this word
[1:52:11] amen and you know when we see someone
[1:52:13] that's
[1:52:14] discouraged what's the best way to help
[1:52:18] someone who's
[1:52:20] discouraged the best way to overcome
[1:52:23] discouragement is with
[1:52:25] encouragement
[1:52:27] amen you know I I saw a thing and I
[1:52:31] thought it was so good many people might
[1:52:33] be aware of it and if if you're
[1:52:35] interested I could probably find it and
[1:52:37] and send it to you with Brother Eugene
[1:52:38] Brown and Edmonton Living Word he he
[1:52:41] used to be a horse trainer and I think
[1:52:42] he still is to some respect but he talks
[1:52:46] about how the round pen training happens
[1:52:49] we might have talked about this in the
[1:52:50] past but I just saw a clip this week and
[1:52:52] I thought it was so good there was a
[1:52:53] horse that just had his first saddle put
[1:52:55] on it and it was running around and it
[1:52:57] was trying to Buck the saddle off and it
[1:52:59] didn't know what to do it was confused
[1:53:01] and there was a guy in the middle of the
[1:53:02] Ring he had a microphone and he was
[1:53:04] talking about how this horse is is just
[1:53:07] it's just dealing with life as it is it
[1:53:10] doesn't know how to deal with this new
[1:53:12] thing happening in its life and so it's
[1:53:14] running around and it's uncomfortable
[1:53:16] and it's scared and and the thing is the
[1:53:18] horse just needs to come to the place of
[1:53:20] of of Peace on its own and when it does
[1:53:23] it's going to actually stop and it's
[1:53:26] going to come right beside the trainer
[1:53:28] in the middle it's going to recognize
[1:53:31] that's the safest place for it is right
[1:53:33] beside the trainer in the middle and the
[1:53:35] man who is speaking he says that's what
[1:53:37] we need to do sometimes we need to
[1:53:38] recognize the safest place for us is
[1:53:40] right beside the father not trying to
[1:53:42] run around and trying to figure out
[1:53:44] because we're scared and we don't
[1:53:45] understand the circumstance and
[1:53:46] situation and try and find a place of
[1:53:48] comfort you know that's what we do
[1:53:50] sometimes but you know what also this
[1:53:52] man said said he said I'm not doing
[1:53:53] anything right now and he kept passing
[1:53:55] the Rope around he stayed in the same
[1:53:57] position and just kept passing the Rope
[1:53:59] around as the horse would run and then
[1:54:01] the horse changed directions and he
[1:54:02] would just keep passing it around he
[1:54:03] said the worst thing that I could do
[1:54:05] right now is point out all of this
[1:54:07] horse's problems point out all this
[1:54:09] horse is doing
[1:54:11] wrong I'm just going to let this horse
[1:54:13] work it out because this horse will
[1:54:15] eventually calm down this horse will
[1:54:17] eventually find peace and the horse did
[1:54:19] came right around and put her head right
[1:54:21] here against him and just calmed right
[1:54:23] down and you know brothers and sisters I
[1:54:26] just can't help but think that's the way
[1:54:27] it is for us as Believers we've got to
[1:54:29] stop running around and trying to make
[1:54:31] it work even though we get nervous we
[1:54:33] all get upset we all have tur turmoils
[1:54:36] and troubles in our lives but we got to
[1:54:38] remember the safest place is right
[1:54:40] beside the Father the best place to deal
[1:54:43] with discouragement is encouragement
[1:54:46] don't try and point out faults and
[1:54:48] failures I'm trying to encourage you
[1:54:51] amen look at the way you're doing that
[1:54:53] I'm just trying to encourage you honey
[1:54:56] are you that's not encouraging if we're
[1:54:58] going to point out faults and failures
[1:55:01] encouragement is to Simply do the
[1:55:03] opposite that's what brother brandham
[1:55:05] said amen just simply do the opposite
[1:55:07] you know I can't stand the way that my
[1:55:09] wife does that every single time every
[1:55:11] single day she does that over and over
[1:55:13] and over and I tell her and she just
[1:55:15] doesn't ever change her ways but what if
[1:55:18] I was to just simply say you know honey
[1:55:20] I love it when you actually do this
[1:55:23] I love it when you actually do it the
[1:55:24] way that I've been talking about or our
[1:55:27] children I just love it when you
[1:55:28] actually behave I love it when you just
[1:55:30] go and put your coat away I love it when
[1:55:33] you actually put your shoes where they
[1:55:35] belong I love it when you just get out
[1:55:37] of bed in the morning I love it when you
[1:55:39] just do what you're supposed to do if we
[1:55:41] would just simply begin doing that
[1:55:42] brothers and sisters with our brothers
[1:55:44] and our sisters we would see a different
[1:55:46] world in which we live in but the devil
[1:55:49] wants us to just be needling on the
[1:55:51] problem
[1:55:52] s and what's happening is our
[1:55:55] discouragement is bringing more
[1:55:56] discouragement and as we're discouraged
[1:55:59] we never get
[1:56:02] encouraged we know there's a spirit
[1:56:04] behind that if we don't recognize it we
[1:56:07] need to recognize it that's a spirit it
[1:56:09] gets in our marriage it gets in our
[1:56:10] church it gets in our families gets in
[1:56:12] our friendships it can get in our
[1:56:14] workplace it's all over schools but you
[1:56:17] know that's the same thing that Bayo
[1:56:19] taught balum to do was just look at the
[1:56:20] hinder parts right and cast a stumbling
[1:56:23] block before the children of Israel
[1:56:26] recognize that they're human beings
[1:56:28] recognize that they've got faults and
[1:56:30] failures they've got weaknesses and as
[1:56:32] soon as that happened we know brother
[1:56:34] bradam talks about it it's in the word
[1:56:37] Kadesh Baria was not a good place for
[1:56:39] the children of Israel Kadesh barnea is
[1:56:41] the place where it was decision time
[1:56:43] where it was changing the direction of
[1:56:45] everything time and we know brother
[1:56:46] brandham in this message questions and
[1:56:48] answers on the Holy Ghost if you don't
[1:56:50] know he says in there the
[1:56:52] Tabernacle is at KES Baria today where
[1:56:57] they're going to make a decision on
[1:56:59] whether they're going to actually follow
[1:57:00] the word of God it's so beautiful
[1:57:02] because he doesn't say it's the
[1:57:03] denominations out there he says this
[1:57:05] Tabernacle is at Kadesh barnea decision
[1:57:08] time where we come to a Crossroads where
[1:57:11] we need to decide what we're going to do
[1:57:14] we know the spirit of God won't always
[1:57:16] strive with man and we all will come to
[1:57:19] that day where we will reach a crossroad
[1:57:22] and I just pray brothers and sisters
[1:57:23] that every single one of us would reach
[1:57:25] that Crossroad and take the right turn
[1:57:28] Hallelujah brother Bram says we're no
[1:57:29] longer building a wall we're turning a
[1:57:33] corner we're building a house a
[1:57:36] three-dimensional building don't be busy
[1:57:38] casting a stumbling block in front of
[1:57:40] people in front of our our families in
[1:57:43] front of our brothers and sisters in
[1:57:44] front of our
[1:57:46] children he says let's I I just want to
[1:57:48] say this not he I want to say this let's
[1:57:51] recognize that this is the devil
[1:57:52] brothers and sisters he just wants to
[1:57:54] discourage us that's all right God wants
[1:57:57] to encourage us the devil wants to
[1:57:59] discourage
[1:58:01] us when we see discouragement coming our
[1:58:04] way that's not from
[1:58:06] God and you know I I just think it's so
[1:58:09] beautiful it took me right back to the
[1:58:11] Ephesian Church age remember when we
[1:58:13] read that just recently I don't know if
[1:58:14] it was last Wednesday or the Wednesday
[1:58:15] before in the Ephesian Church age the
[1:58:17] exposition of seven Church ages God
[1:58:19] knows exactly what to discourage us Us
[1:58:22] in and exactly what to encourage Us in
[1:58:26] amen he knows exactly what we need and
[1:58:28] when we need it he knows how much
[1:58:30] pressure we need but God doesn't come
[1:58:32] and apply sickness in our lives remember
[1:58:35] he says who can get my word to come to
[1:58:37] pass in brother Barry's life who can get
[1:58:40] my word to come to pass in my son or my
[1:58:42] daughter's life who who who can do that
[1:58:45] for me God doesn't throw sickness on us
[1:58:47] it's the devil that does it but God
[1:58:49] always has his will his way
[1:58:52] he knows how to encourage us and
[1:58:54] discourage Us in the things that we need
[1:58:56] we need to remember brothers and sisters
[1:58:58] that our words have power we're we're
[1:58:59] living in an age that's different than
[1:59:01] any other
[1:59:02] age we had talked about it with the
[1:59:05] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[1:59:06] how we're we're just talking about the
[1:59:08] Ephesian Church Age and and it can seem
[1:59:10] like that church age is just for that
[1:59:12] church age and truly indeed it was but
[1:59:14] all of that carries forward to the next
[1:59:17] Church age we read that last Wednesday
[1:59:19] and all of those first two Church ages
[1:59:21] carry forward to the Third Church age
[1:59:24] and all of those first three Church ages
[1:59:26] carry forward to the fourth to the fifth
[1:59:28] to the sixth and here we are in the
[1:59:30] seventh we've got all of that pressure
[1:59:32] from all of those Church ages now in the
[1:59:34] day in which we live in that's why
[1:59:36] outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:59:38] there's no way that we're ever going to
[1:59:39] be able to
[1:59:39] stand there's no way that this message
[1:59:42] will ever do us any good brothers and
[1:59:43] sisters outside of Christ the holy ghost
[1:59:46] coming to live inside of us but you know
[1:59:48] if you have once been enlightened with
[1:59:51] this word if you have tasted of the
[1:59:53] Heavenly gift and you have gone forward
[1:59:55] all the way to be sealed with the Holy
[1:59:57] Ghost then you will never ever be able
[2:00:00] to fall and brother bradam says that it
[2:00:03] is impossible for someone who has once
[2:00:05] been enlightened it is absolutely
[2:00:07] impossible for you to fall if you get
[2:00:09] yourself all the way into Christ and
[2:00:11] Christ all the way into you we don't
[2:00:13] have to have that worry like the
[2:00:15] scripture says maybe oh my one day I
[2:00:17] could fall you can never fall amen we
[2:00:21] said it last week believe brother bradam
[2:00:23] even tells a story about that that
[2:00:25] preacher that decided he was given up on
[2:00:26] it he was done with it and he was going
[2:00:28] to go and get a case of beer he sent his
[2:00:29] his assistant or young brother or
[2:00:31] someone in the church to go and get him
[2:00:33] a box of beer and the boy said I'm not
[2:00:35] doing it but the man went and did it
[2:00:37] anyways and what happened God took him
[2:00:39] home right because he won't allow any of
[2:00:42] his to be lost we might choose to take a
[2:00:45] different direction but that's going to
[2:00:47] be the time God steps in and says okay
[2:00:49] that's time to take you home because you
[2:00:51] will not be lost
[2:00:52] I will not lose one
[2:00:55] right today brothers and sisters my
[2:00:58] prayer is that we just don't get
[2:01:00] leprosy I'm going to end the the
[2:01:02] discussion on the questions and answers
[2:01:04] of the Holy Ghost it is not possible for
[2:01:07] those who are once
[2:01:08] enlightened who have tasted of this
[2:01:10] heavenly gift and the word of God it's
[2:01:13] not possible for you to ever fall away
[2:01:15] you will never ever be able to be lost
[2:01:18] if you have Jesus Christ the same
[2:01:20] yesterday today and forever the Holy
[2:01:21] Ghost ghost living in your life you will
[2:01:24] never be able to be lost and I pray that
[2:01:27] today we don't get
[2:01:29] leprosy leprosy is a type of unbelief
[2:01:33] and you know I I just when I was
[2:01:34] thinking about this this idea of leprosy
[2:01:38] and how that's what was portrayed why
[2:01:40] did he use that in the Bible why did
[2:01:42] Miriam get
[2:01:43] leprosy because it's super
[2:01:47] contagious super
[2:01:49] contagious if something wasn't done
[2:01:51] about her
[2:01:52] she would have spread that leprosy
[2:01:54] throughout the whole congregation
[2:01:56] throughout the whole Camp right right
[2:01:59] and God said just let her be separated
[2:02:01] now even if her father spit in her face
[2:02:04] just let her be separated for seven days
[2:02:06] let her spend her time let her think
[2:02:08] about her actions but then when she has
[2:02:11] done her time then she can come back in
[2:02:13] leprosy is very contagious brothers and
[2:02:16] sisters that's why it is a type of
[2:02:18] unbelief it's a very contagious thing
[2:02:21] spirit travel on words when we're going
[2:02:24] to talk don't let any corrupt
[2:02:26] communication come out of your mouth but
[2:02:28] something that's edifying Let It Be
[2:02:29] edifying to the body to the people to
[2:02:32] the situations because you know the
[2:02:35] devil is roaming about as a roaring lion
[2:02:37] seeing whom he will devour and and it's
[2:02:40] sad but true our children are definitely
[2:02:43] vulnerable in our homes to get leprosy
[2:02:47] spiritual leprosy if we're not careful
[2:02:49] they'll hear the conversation and it'll
[2:02:51] go right into their heart and they'll
[2:02:53] think that's what Mom and Dad is
[2:02:55] treating the situation as and you know
[2:02:57] what happens is Mom and Dad will be held
[2:03:00] accountable for the
[2:03:03] children other family members can catch
[2:03:06] it other church members can catch it I
[2:03:10] just can't help but think I I like that
[2:03:12] shut your mouth Ministry we heard
[2:03:14] brother Cadre talk about it and I heard
[2:03:16] a brother in our congregation back when
[2:03:18] I was early on in this message of the
[2:03:20] hour he told me to shut up I don't want
[2:03:22] to hear another word about that brother
[2:03:23] he's my brother shut your mouth don't
[2:03:27] tell me another word and as long as
[2:03:29] we're willing to say oh yeah oh yeah
[2:03:32] that brother I know he's like that you
[2:03:33] know it's just spirit's going back and
[2:03:35] forth spirit's going back and forth
[2:03:37] spirit's going back and forth if we've
[2:03:39] got a desire in our heart to go and talk
[2:03:41] bad about a brother and a sister I want
[2:03:42] to say this do we even really have the
[2:03:44] Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[2:03:46] sisters because the word of God says
[2:03:48] that if we have ought against a brother
[2:03:50] or a brother has ought against us what
[2:03:52] are we supposed to do we supposed to go
[2:03:54] to that brother or that sister not to
[2:03:55] someone else and talk about them if
[2:03:58] that's what we're doing it's
[2:04:00] wrong now I'm not saying that you can't
[2:04:02] have the Holy Ghost and go and do that
[2:04:05] but I am saying that when you do that
[2:04:06] you'll want to go and make it right
[2:04:09] you'll want to go and make it
[2:04:11] right yes other church members other
[2:04:15] churches they can get it they're only
[2:04:16] going to be listening to what you say
[2:04:18] really they're going to think wow that
[2:04:20] church is going through that and and and
[2:04:22] and I know that you're a Believer and
[2:04:23] and to hear that that's what's going on
[2:04:25] that's
[2:04:28] terrible simply passing
[2:04:31] on
[2:04:33] leprosy the only inoculation for it
[2:04:35] brothers and sisters is the Holy Ghost
[2:04:38] the person of Jesus
[2:04:39] Christ you know if we if
[2:04:42] we if we are truly living in that
[2:04:46] seventh age if we are truly living in
[2:04:50] that place where it's the culmination of
[2:04:53] all the other ages in the spoken word
[2:04:55] condition brothers and sisters oughtn't
[2:04:57] we to be living well beyond the
[2:05:01] ABCs understanding the great spiritual
[2:05:05] things not needing to be taught and and
[2:05:09] I I don't think that we need to don't
[2:05:10] get me wrong I I just I can only bring
[2:05:13] what the Lord puts on my heart and and
[2:05:16] Lord willing will move on and let me
[2:05:17] assure you that I feel like this has
[2:05:19] gone on a long time talking about the
[2:05:22] Holy Ghost and I just think it's a
[2:05:24] wonderful topic it doesn't get any
[2:05:26] better but sometimes it can feel like it
[2:05:28] gets stagnant and I don't mean it to be
[2:05:30] that way I'll call the musicians now we
[2:05:32] have a service
[2:05:34] tonight I'm going to read a quote out of
[2:05:36] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[2:05:38] uh out of the sardan church age brother
[2:05:41] branam says this make no mistake about
[2:05:45] it I just love how cut and dried it is
[2:05:48] make no mistake about it a person that
[2:05:51] is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[2:05:55] the body of
[2:05:57] Christ receiving the fullness of the
[2:06:00] spirit will be in the word all the
[2:06:04] way
[2:06:06] yes and I think that's just such a
[2:06:08] beautiful thing because you know I don't
[2:06:12] want to say that they'll be in the word
[2:06:14] all the way saying oh I believe that God
[2:06:17] sent a prophet yeah I'm in the word all
[2:06:18] the way they're going to be living the
[2:06:21] word all the way it's going to be
[2:06:23] apparent in their lives maybe stand with
[2:06:25] me as we close we're not going to be
[2:06:27] just saying that I'm in the word all the
[2:06:30] way we're going to be living it amen he
[2:06:34] says that's the evidence of being
[2:06:35] baptized with the Holy
[2:06:37] Ghost Judas
[2:06:40] failed multitudes fail right
[2:06:44] there and when they fail to go on in
[2:06:47] that word their names are taken off the
[2:06:50] Book of Life
[2:06:53] brothers and sisters it's just it's just
[2:06:55] nothing to play with this this is
[2:06:57] nothing to
[2:06:59] just act as though it's it's not going
[2:07:02] to affect me it's going to affect way
[2:07:05] more than maybe we think or maybe than
[2:07:08] we
[2:07:09] feel it's very important for us to get
[2:07:11] the Holy Ghost that's the only thing get
[2:07:13] into Christ brothers and sisters don't
[2:07:15] just go right up to the edge of it I I I
[2:07:18] feel like I didn't even really do this
[2:07:20] justice but I just trust that if you
[2:07:23] have the desire for Christ in your life
[2:07:25] if there is a cry for more Christ in
[2:07:28] your life it's because there's more
[2:07:30] Christ for you to have in your
[2:07:32] life and and he is more than willing to
[2:07:35] actually give
[2:07:37] that I uh failed to mention our visitors
[2:07:40] we have brother Anthony and sister gift
[2:07:43] and their baby L Nathan visiting from
[2:07:46] Nigeria God bless you am we have brother
[2:07:50] Isaac from ont IO and his sister Sarah
[2:07:53] from Nigeria God richly bless you as
[2:07:55] well I trust you feel right at home here
[2:07:58] brothers and sisters don't just go right
[2:08:00] up to the
[2:08:01] edge brother bradam he says in paragraph
[2:08:04] 198 now of questions and answers now
[2:08:08] them borderline Believers back there
[2:08:10] they was right with them they were
[2:08:12] circumcised with their circumcision they
[2:08:14] went right over to the land that God
[2:08:17] promised right to the edge of it and
[2:08:20] many a man walks up to that edge he'll
[2:08:24] walk right up to the baptism of the Holy
[2:08:27] Ghost and reject
[2:08:30] it he doesn't say just resist it or just
[2:08:33] step aside from it he says reject
[2:08:36] it he'll walk right up to the baptism of
[2:08:39] the Holy Ghost and reject it he don't
[2:08:42] want to give it up he'll walk right up
[2:08:45] to the scripture baptism in the name of
[2:08:48] Jesus Christ turn his back back and
[2:08:52] rejecting it to keep from seeing
[2:08:55] it
[2:08:57] my I just want to encourage everyone to
[2:09:00] get into Christ that's all I can say
[2:09:01] brothers and sisters remember the
[2:09:02] communion service tonight at

[2:09:19] giving us the understanding that if
[2:09:21] you're going going to speak to man
[2:09:22] you're going to use a prophet to speak
[2:09:24] to man that's the way you're going to do
[2:09:26] it that's the way that you have started
[2:09:28] with you are the same yesterday today
