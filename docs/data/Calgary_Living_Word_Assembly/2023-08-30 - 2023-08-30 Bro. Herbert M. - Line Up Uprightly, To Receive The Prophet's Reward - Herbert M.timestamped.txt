[48:19] Meadow said to me when you get out there
[48:21] you're going to be able to look as far
[48:22] as the eye can see that way and as far
[48:25] as the eye can see that way and you
[48:27] won't be able to see one devil
[48:29] he was exactly right we had just a
[48:31] tremendous time
[48:33] I'm certainly thankful to be back safely
[48:35] it was many many kilometers traveled and
[48:39] we are always thankful for his traveling
[48:42] Mercies
[48:43] it's wonderful to get away but it's
[48:44] certainly better to get home
[48:46] home is where our heart truly is
[48:49] I bring you greetings from Saskatoon
[48:51] Tabernacle and everyone that was there
[48:53] brother Dwayne fair I know that brother
[48:56] Mena was here and he offered greetings
[48:58] and uh yeah it was just a wonderful time
[49:00] last Wednesday at Saskatoon Tabernacle
[49:03] and uh straight away after service we
[49:06] began the journey we drove for two hours
[49:08] North and began the whole entire thing
[49:11] but we're certainly thankful to be here
[49:13] tonight we have uh just one prayer
[49:16] request we wanted to bring before the
[49:17] church I certainly want to thank
[49:19] everyone as well for your prayers for my
[49:21] nephew Zachary
[49:24] um
[49:25] certainly difficult many times in life
[49:28] we don't understand why the Lord allows
[49:30] things the way he allows them oh we know
[49:33] that's his perfect will
[49:35] nothing happens unless he first allows
[49:37] it to happen and for my mother to be
[49:39] allowed to have muscular dystrophy for
[49:41] my sister to be allowed to have Muscular
[49:43] Dystrophy and my nephew to be allowed to
[49:45] have muscular dystrophy how is that how
[49:48] does it happen it's the Lord's will not
[49:50] for us to be sick his will is that we
[49:53] would be well that we would prosper and
[49:55] be in good health but we know it's for a
[49:58] purpose and I just want to thank
[49:59] everyone for your prayers he's back home
[50:01] from the hospital he had a broken femur
[50:04] and was in tremendous amounts of pain
[50:07] and now they're trying to manage phlegm
[50:09] from becoming pneumonia there's all the
[50:11] doctor's terminology but we know the
[50:13] great physician and tonight I just want
[50:16] to ask that we could just one more time
[50:17] intercede for Zach at home with his
[50:20] family they're under great pressure
[50:22] tremendous pressure trying to care for
[50:24] their son it's more than they can bear
[50:26] but they're doing their very best and if
[50:29] you can just remember a special request
[50:31] for his daddy
[50:34] Brad
[50:36] you know many times in this world
[50:38] men can just leave relationships because
[50:41] they don't go the way they want but this
[50:43] man has been a soldier he has stood firm
[50:47] in his position as the dad
[50:49] and he is not backed down not one bit
[50:52] from caring for his wife or his son I
[50:55] believe that man is a champion and if
[50:58] you could just thank the Lord for Brad
[51:00] nadarach
[51:01] you have a need tonight let's just go to
[51:03] him in prayer
[51:05] gracious Heavenly Father
[51:08] Lord we're so thankful for your goodness
[51:10] tonight we heard about it
[51:12] and we sang it father and Lord I believe
[51:14] it was more than just lips from her
[51:17] lungs it was truly from our hearts Lord
[51:19] not from our hearts but from the heart
[51:21] that you put inside of us father your
[51:24] word says that you'll take out the Stony
[51:26] heart and you'll replace it with a flesh
[51:29] a heart of Flesh Lord and we know that
[51:31] it's not even our flesh it's yours
[51:33] father and tonight we're so thankful for
[51:35] your goodness to us Lord one more time
[51:37] to be able to gather together in your
[51:39] name in your presence father Lord we
[51:42] just want to remember every uplift hand
[51:44] made known unto you tonight Lord the
[51:46] many requests in our lives and father we
[51:49] just thank you for meeting each need
[51:50] sovereignly father and Lord we just want
[51:53] to remember the natarak family Lord my
[51:55] sister Kelly and their son Zach
[51:59] Lord and and Brad their their dad and
[52:01] husband father lord they're in such
[52:04] tremendous trial but father we know that
[52:06] you're in complete control and it's for
[52:08] your glory Lord and father we just ask
[52:11] that Lord you would just help them to
[52:13] come to know you fully in the power of
[52:15] your Resurrection father Lord that maybe
[52:17] somehow they would be able to see this
[52:20] message of the hour and understand that
[52:22] you are the same yesterday today and
[52:24] forever Lord
[52:26] father we thank you for the testimony
[52:28] Lord we thank you for each member of the
[52:30] family Lord and we know that it's for
[52:32] your purpose so Lord we just ask that
[52:34] your will would be done there in their
[52:36] lives father that you would continue to
[52:39] bless them Father in health Lord we know
[52:41] that we have already quoted it your word
[52:43] says that we would you would that we
[52:46] would prosper and be in good health so
[52:48] father we just ask that they could
[52:49] continue to prosper and be in good
[52:52] health father we know the doctor's
[52:53] report was that Zach wouldn't live to
[52:55] age 16 because of that disease but oh
[52:58] lord your report says that he's 24 years
[53:00] old now oh we thank you Father for your
[53:03] goodness to us Lord we know it's for
[53:06] many years of Prayer
[53:07] and Lord we're so thankful I thank you

[1:04:17] so standing up like that
[1:04:20] we shall turn to our Bibles
[1:04:23] and read from the book of
[1:04:26] Matthew
[1:04:28] chapter 10
[1:04:41] it will be good for us to read three
[1:04:44] scriptures so that
[1:04:47] well I I will be
[1:04:49] Matthew
[1:04:53] chapter 10
[1:05:03] Matthew chapter 10
[1:05:06] let's read verse 40
[1:05:09] uh one
[1:05:16] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[1:05:19] of a prophet
[1:05:21] he shall receive a prophet is a reward
[1:05:25] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[1:05:27] in the name of a righteous man
[1:05:31] shall receive a righteous man is
[1:05:34] reward
[1:05:36] then the book of uh
[1:05:40] Romans chapter 10
[1:05:43] verse 14 and 15.
[1:05:46] how then shall they call on him
[1:05:51] in whom they have not believed
[1:05:54] the how shall they believe in him
[1:05:58] of whom they have not heard
[1:06:02] and how shall they hear
[1:06:05] without
[1:06:07] a preacher
[1:06:12] the rest we shall read after we have sat
[1:06:14] down there our heavenly father
[1:06:17] I won't raise up a prayer after reading
[1:06:20] this scripture here
[1:06:23] that father Lord God
[1:06:25] you may
[1:06:27] open up the inner mind about this
[1:06:31] message that I'm about to preach
[1:06:35] further that it may come
[1:06:38] and a view of great impact
[1:06:40] to our souls our bodies and our spirits
[1:06:46] bless the whole congregation
[1:06:49] and take me out of the way
[1:06:52] just use my voice and use my lips
[1:06:55] because I am thine I am yours
[1:06:59] father forgive me in anything that may
[1:07:02] be contrary
[1:07:03] but rather take up stand with your word
[1:07:06] as a promise speak to us
[1:07:10] then we shall say
[1:07:12] you have been with us
[1:07:14] in Jesus name Lord we pray amen
[1:07:17] we may be seated
[1:07:25] okay
[1:07:31] now
[1:07:34] our subject tonight says
[1:07:38] line up accurately
[1:07:41] to receive a promissory word
[1:07:46] line up accurately to receive a
[1:07:48] prophetess I mean a prophet is reward
[1:07:52] you have to line up accurately
[1:07:56] you need not to be crooked
[1:07:59] you need to be in line
[1:08:02] how is it going to happen
[1:08:05] just pay attention
[1:08:08] that we may look into this holy
[1:08:10] scriptures
[1:08:14] ah our Lord Jesus Christ is the one
[1:08:18] who spoke and I said
[1:08:20] he that receives a prophet
[1:08:25] he that receives a prophet
[1:08:28] in
[1:08:30] ah
[1:08:31] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:08:34] prophet's reward
[1:08:36] and I he that receives the righteous man
[1:08:38] in the name of our Testament shall
[1:08:40] receiver a testament his reward
[1:08:43] so how do we line up how do we line up
[1:08:46] and I get this reward
[1:08:49] we have some of us not all of us some of
[1:08:53] us in this world as it is wide
[1:08:57] we have been going crooked leaving the
[1:09:00] line
[1:09:02] and then we miss the reward
[1:09:05] but I already said
[1:09:07] he who will
[1:09:10] receive
[1:09:12] so you can put yourself
[1:09:16] in that place oh whoever
[1:09:20] I know you have a name here
[1:09:22] you may be Patrick
[1:09:24] you may be Sister Lisa
[1:09:31] you can't be there maybe I can use Paul
[1:09:34] and others
[1:09:35] oh
[1:09:37] whoever then you put yourself there
[1:09:40] wherever and I say that is in me uh-huh
[1:09:44] then we can put whoever receive a
[1:09:47] prophet okay then we can also add a
[1:09:51] prophet to be number two
[1:09:54] that's right
[1:09:55] then
[1:09:57] also
[1:10:00] uh we add that one who promised who said
[1:10:05] whoever was that one saying that was our
[1:10:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:09] so we find that there are three now
[1:10:13] so it's Jesus Christ
[1:10:17] who commanded
[1:10:20] and we are going to start with him
[1:10:22] because he is
[1:10:24] a perfect
[1:10:25] person
[1:10:27] in him there is no any Rebellion
[1:10:33] in him there is no any guile
[1:10:37] in him there's no any spot
[1:10:41] in him there is no any stain
[1:10:46] there is no any question mark that we
[1:10:49] can question
[1:10:50] he is ever omnipotent omnisayan he is
[1:10:55] perfect
[1:10:58] so we have got him now
[1:11:01] we need the two who are remaining
[1:11:06] the two are remaining must also line up
[1:11:09] so that we get a reward
[1:11:14] now Edward is our promise
[1:11:18] what is a reward
[1:11:20] any word is anything that you lack in
[1:11:23] your life whether you need it
[1:11:26] it is a need
[1:11:29] it's not a demand
[1:11:31] any word is in it even going to raptures
[1:11:35] in it because some people say I wish
[1:11:39] I get out of here
[1:11:41] I am tired of this I'm tired of this so
[1:11:44] you have a need you need a proper place
[1:11:47] you need another good body
[1:11:50] you need that everything
[1:11:53] so we find out that any word comes after
[1:11:58] the three have lined up accurately
[1:12:03] now we have found that God has never
[1:12:05] changed he is always perfect
[1:12:10] so now he needs also he needs a proper
[1:12:15] prophet he needs someone
[1:12:18] then we see here in the Bible that God
[1:12:22] arrangs everything because when we read
[1:12:24] the book of uh of romanism he said like
[1:12:28] this it was Roman 4 10 14. how then
[1:12:32] shall they
[1:12:33] call on him in whom they have not
[1:12:36] believed who are these These are the
[1:12:39] Believers now
[1:12:41] how can they call on Jesus
[1:12:44] how can they call on God how can they
[1:12:47] believe in him because there's no one
[1:12:50] who revealed God to them no one who has
[1:12:53] preached to them so what God does
[1:12:56] first of all he prepares a prophet
[1:13:02] he arrangs someone
[1:13:06] remember we are learning with the
[1:13:08] prophet but the scripture talked about
[1:13:10] too
[1:13:11] a prophet and a righteous man
[1:13:14] but let's go with the prophet first of
[1:13:16] all
[1:13:17] so it is God who prepares a prophet
[1:13:23] and when he prepares him
[1:13:26] then that's number two
[1:13:29] then number three
[1:13:31] he prepares
[1:13:33] those who can receive a prophet
[1:13:38] yes yes then he says how can they the
[1:13:42] Believers
[1:13:44] how can they know God how can they trust
[1:13:48] God how can they call god without a
[1:13:52] preacher or without a prophet
[1:13:56] so God prepares this prophet
[1:13:59] then the Bible says that um
[1:14:03] and how shall they preach
[1:14:06] except they be sent
[1:14:09] now it's good again
[1:14:11] who sense these preachers who sends
[1:14:15] these Prophets
[1:14:16] he is the one who sends them
[1:14:19] now after we have got that clear picture
[1:14:22] we shall go to the book of uh
[1:14:26] of
[1:14:28] First Kings chapter 17 to find out a
[1:14:32] guru example
[1:14:35] then we shall discover
[1:14:37] that if we can keep on lining up because
[1:14:41] I remember
[1:14:44] in the message
[1:14:45] there's somewhere where brother Branham
[1:14:47] saw in the end of time
[1:14:50] when some
[1:14:52] The Pride some members of the Bride
[1:14:55] group were deviating out of the line
[1:14:59] then he said stay in the line
[1:15:04] that's right so we can now go and find
[1:15:08] out a good example is in the book of
[1:15:11] First Kings chapter 17 if you will start
[1:15:15] from
[1:15:18] uh
[1:15:19] chapter 17
[1:15:22] if you can start from verse 2 says
[1:15:26] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[1:15:29] this is Elijah now and the word of the
[1:15:31] Lord he came unto him saying
[1:15:40] that is before Jordan
[1:15:43] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[1:15:47] the Brook and I have Commit commanded
[1:15:51] the robins to feed everywhere
[1:15:54] so he went and did according unto the
[1:15:57] word of the Lord
[1:15:59] for he went and dwelt by the Brook
[1:16:02] Terrace that's before Jordan
[1:16:04] here is Elijah
[1:16:07] God is
[1:16:09] sending him
[1:16:11] he is preparing him
[1:16:15] he is equipping him
[1:16:18] to make him be of great value
[1:16:22] to someone to a receiver
[1:16:26] so then we find out that
[1:16:29] God being a true God
[1:16:32] he also needs a true prophet
[1:16:37] now a true Prophet how does he become a
[1:16:40] true Prophet God always walks on him to
[1:16:45] start what we call an obedient
[1:16:48] Foundation
[1:16:51] to be started
[1:16:55] it's like borrow said I have laid the
[1:16:57] foundation
[1:16:59] but whoever builds son let him be
[1:17:01] careful
[1:17:02] you see now here God takes a prophet
[1:17:06] Prophet Elijah
[1:17:09] and I sense him
[1:17:11] to the river
[1:17:13] he did not send him to a certain mansion
[1:17:16] or anything
[1:17:18] but that's a river
[1:17:20] whereby if you see the circumstances of
[1:17:25] the river
[1:17:27] what things
[1:17:28] stay by the river
[1:17:30] you you will wander
[1:17:33] by the river
[1:17:35] snakes tortoise
[1:17:37] ah maybe even some spiders
[1:17:41] mosquitos and so on and
[1:17:45] to Adam he also said I have commanded
[1:17:49] the Revenant not doves
[1:17:54] because people they keep dancing their
[1:17:56] homes they are good birds and so on they
[1:18:00] cooperate
[1:18:01] but okay sir I've never in America he is
[1:18:05] it Canada they love they love what they
[1:18:08] call pets and so on but I don't see
[1:18:11] people keeping grabbing each other they
[1:18:14] are pets and whatever
[1:18:15] because the way how the rabbits behave
[1:18:18] they eat from garbage
[1:18:22] and one of them has a bad history in the
[1:18:25] time of Noah
[1:18:26] when Noah said to one of them it never
[1:18:29] came back
[1:18:30] so it had a bad history
[1:18:32] and this is a thing that God is telling
[1:18:36] he's a prophet I have commanded them
[1:18:41] he did not say maybe no he said I would
[1:18:45] redirect it it cannot change it has been
[1:18:48] done by me and I am a true God what you
[1:18:51] do is to follow my instructions I have
[1:18:55] commanded I have done it already
[1:18:58] amen so here we don't find any answering
[1:19:03] we don't find any why and how we don't
[1:19:08] find those kind of fuming or grumbling
[1:19:11] no the Bible has told us in in verse 5
[1:19:16] so he went and did according to the word
[1:19:22] of God
[1:19:25] you see such kind of a foundation that
[1:19:28] God is laying you'll see such kind of
[1:19:31] obedience
[1:19:33] you see when God wants to use something
[1:19:36] he prepares it
[1:19:38] he cleanses it he makes it a blessing to
[1:19:42] to a blessing to other people so in
[1:19:46] other times I would say
[1:19:48] uh God is the source of blessings
[1:19:52] God is the source of the rewards
[1:19:56] but when he's sending them he must use
[1:19:59] something so any cause to use a human
[1:20:02] being he must deal with that human being
[1:20:06] until he reaches a quality that is
[1:20:11] worthy to send the blessing to someone
[1:20:14] through that person
[1:20:18] praise the Lord
[1:20:20] yeah so therefore
[1:20:22] this is someone you know God has what we
[1:20:25] call terms under condition Sometimes
[1:20:28] some conditions that he gives
[1:20:31] you you can ask yourself why but being a
[1:20:36] creature a Creator a creature yourself
[1:20:39] you are created by Him you have nothing
[1:20:42] to ask him
[1:20:44] you just be obedient
[1:20:47] because you are just easy creation
[1:20:51] so
[1:20:53] I wonder how
[1:20:55] sometimes it doesn't like in the time of
[1:20:58] if you remember Elijah Elijah when he
[1:21:01] sent gay has to go and take the road and
[1:21:04] put on that tuna Mighty Zoo boy that him
[1:21:08] he said don't greet don't do this he
[1:21:11] gave him conditions why because he knows
[1:21:14] that God deals with
[1:21:17] good good good obedience
[1:21:22] he gives things to create and obedience
[1:21:25] in someone
[1:21:27] that's why they couldn't have gone
[1:21:29] sometimes they are tried
[1:21:31] they are tried so that God is building
[1:21:34] an obedience Foundation anywhere
[1:21:39] they were tense around
[1:21:41] they were good houses around
[1:21:44] but see how God is sailing Elijah to a
[1:21:47] river
[1:21:50] there were some people who can feed him
[1:21:52] around but see how he's saying
[1:21:56] these birds will
[1:21:58] do these parts also have their own fresh
[1:22:00] way at again
[1:22:03] when you see buzzards on the road when
[1:22:06] you see Revenue somewhere they are
[1:22:08] feeding on things that are already dead
[1:22:13] but this is what God did to Elijah
[1:22:17] why was he doing that
[1:22:19] he was preparing him to be an obedient
[1:22:23] verse so
[1:22:25] he was preparing him to be a good
[1:22:28] something that blessings can go through
[1:22:31] without any Grumble or without an
[1:22:36] obstacle
[1:22:38] praise the Lord
[1:22:41] that's what he did
[1:22:44] so therefore now we have seen God is
[1:22:49] number one omnipotent who is he perfect
[1:22:53] he has the resources of rewards
[1:22:56] blessings he wants to send them
[1:22:59] somewhere he wants to create Faith
[1:23:02] somewhere he wants to create a a good
[1:23:07] collaboration or good relationship
[1:23:09] somewhere and I uses that remember we
[1:23:13] have said in the Book of Romans that how
[1:23:16] can they call on him
[1:23:18] whom they have never known even
[1:23:23] then he prepares someone who can go and
[1:23:26] tell them
[1:23:27] so they can believe in him
[1:23:30] so now we get to
[1:23:33] we have got God
[1:23:35] now we have got Elijah
[1:23:39] okay
[1:23:41] so what is the intention
[1:23:44] the Final Destination was not
[1:23:46] reworkative
[1:23:48] but there was a woman somewhere we know
[1:23:51] very well the story
[1:23:53] where God was intending to send Elijah
[1:23:57] that this woman shall
[1:24:00] receive a reward
[1:24:04] praise the Lord
[1:24:06] any Hard Times
[1:24:08] where people were assessing famine
[1:24:11] where people were
[1:24:13] becoming so skinny because you know you
[1:24:17] eat to because to be good
[1:24:20] but when you don't eat how can you look
[1:24:23] good
[1:24:24] you eat building food then everything
[1:24:28] which makes your skin look good and I
[1:24:30] will tell everything has a purpose
[1:24:32] so maybe the the life of that woman
[1:24:35] changed and
[1:24:37] her own son was they were to die so they
[1:24:41] had an expectation that death is going
[1:24:45] to occur on us
[1:24:47] but praise the Lord life is going to
[1:24:49] occur on them
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:54] then after that
[1:24:56] after God is seeing that now Elijah is
[1:25:01] already in the line
[1:25:02] so he was looking for the third person
[1:25:05] because three is a number of perfection
[1:25:11] so he was looking for the third person
[1:25:15] to stand in the line
[1:25:18] so that His blessings goes through
[1:25:21] without any obstacle but that it might
[1:25:26] flow very smoothly that it might go
[1:25:30] where it is going
[1:25:32] then here he comes
[1:25:34] here he arrives now God tells him now
[1:25:38] you have done according to my word
[1:25:42] I want you to go somewhere
[1:25:45] that that person will also do according
[1:25:49] to your word but it's not your word it
[1:25:53] is my word
[1:25:55] praise the Lord
[1:25:57] barely hear
[1:25:59] this man of God because
[1:26:02] and when he reaches there because of his
[1:26:05] tough situation things were not good
[1:26:09] this human here the Widow
[1:26:12] she started to have some answer some
[1:26:16] reasoning capacities that she had around
[1:26:20] the atmosphere she looked at the
[1:26:22] atmosphere she said this is a trial
[1:26:26] how can you come and ask me food yet
[1:26:29] it's only our expectation for me and my
[1:26:33] son after we eat this remember that she
[1:26:37] mentioned that then we die
[1:26:44] but what Elijah did
[1:26:47] let me uh
[1:26:49] someone give me a quote of brother
[1:26:51] Branham about this woman when there's
[1:26:54] something like that
[1:26:59] reaction to an action
[1:27:04] that message book reaction
[1:27:07] to an action
[1:27:09] then she had she started to turn again
[1:27:13] under she had the voice saying
[1:27:17] but bringing me
[1:27:19] one fast
[1:27:22] what do we
[1:27:24] learn here
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:30] okay put it there yes
[1:27:33] if it can be here where someone can see
[1:27:37] all right
[1:27:40] then she
[1:27:45] under she had a voice saying but bring
[1:27:48] me one fast
[1:27:50] you see this is now a prophet
[1:27:53] trying to correct this woman here
[1:27:57] because she was standing aside
[1:28:01] he wants her
[1:28:03] to be accurate in the line
[1:28:06] to be a true receiver
[1:28:10] because Jesus said whoever will receive
[1:28:12] our prophet
[1:28:14] so she wanted not to receive a prophet
[1:28:19] because if you don't receive a word of a
[1:28:22] prophet then we have refused to receive
[1:28:24] the prophet
[1:28:27] then here a prophet
[1:28:30] tries to correct
[1:28:32] to bring her back in the line
[1:28:35] then he said
[1:28:37] bring me one fast
[1:28:43] I'm still reading ah so what do we learn
[1:28:47] here what do we run here
[1:28:50] seek you fast the kingdom of God
[1:28:53] how will I make it I can't tell you but
[1:28:57] you put God first
[1:29:00] seek you from the kingdom of God and his
[1:29:03] righteousness all these things other
[1:29:06] things will be added okay but bring me
[1:29:10] one fast
[1:29:11] look
[1:29:13] she didn't have to go down and get her
[1:29:16] last penny she had to go down
[1:29:19] bread
[1:29:22] she didn't have to go for this all of
[1:29:26] that or maybe King doctors or so forth
[1:29:29] some retro in silicone thing but she had
[1:29:33] to go to the only thing that stood
[1:29:35] between her and the death
[1:29:38] and her child
[1:29:40] bring me a little cake fast in your hand
[1:29:44] I can see I know they are ahead
[1:29:47] obedience
[1:29:50] obedient that is what God requires
[1:29:56] you get the word under the spirit mixed
[1:29:59] together
[1:30:00] self-sacrifice obedience
[1:30:04] when God is the prophet to say the
[1:30:07] certain thing do it hold on to it
[1:30:12] that is it
[1:30:15] praise the Lord
[1:30:17] yes that's why I told you that God looks
[1:30:21] for an obedience
[1:30:25] God could create
[1:30:28] he created the manner in the wilderness
[1:30:32] he made the bread and the people ate it
[1:30:35] he couldn't do anything for Elijah to
[1:30:37] eat but he is asking for this woman
[1:30:41] bringing me fast
[1:30:44] trying to correct her and bring her in
[1:30:46] the line
[1:30:48] so when she allowed to come in the line
[1:30:51] she received a prophet's reward
[1:30:56] what happened
[1:30:58] miracles
[1:31:00] what happened
[1:31:01] and he said over death life
[1:31:05] because she didn't die
[1:31:08] she lived
[1:31:10] and what happened she became a question
[1:31:13] among the community
[1:31:17] what makes your life to change
[1:31:20] we are different we are dying
[1:31:24] but you are always so happy and so good
[1:31:28] and so heresy what makes you alive
[1:31:31] change her answer is I received a
[1:31:37] prophet
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:45] thank you
[1:31:46] praise the Lord
[1:31:50] now maybe before we go very far if you
[1:31:55] can again also in this uh
[1:31:59] question and answers paid 101
[1:32:04] 100 1042
[1:32:08] question and answers
[1:32:10] page 1042 it's brother Branham if you
[1:32:15] have time
[1:32:17] please explain in Matthew 10 41 the one
[1:32:20] we have been reading so bring for us
[1:32:23] that one we see what the prophet is
[1:32:25] going to talk about
[1:32:30] here I have it it's already written down
[1:32:32] here with me but we can't he says
[1:32:36] if you have time please explain imagine
[1:32:39] 10 41 I would like to know what is a
[1:32:42] prophet is the reward
[1:32:45] well now Jesus said
[1:32:49] who's ever receive a prophet in the name
[1:32:52] of our Prophet receiver Prophet is the
[1:32:55] reward
[1:32:56] a prophet is reward is to be a friend
[1:32:58] with the prophet whosoever receives the
[1:33:01] righteous man in the name of our richest
[1:33:03] man receiver that just man is the reward
[1:33:05] is that right and if they want to know
[1:33:08] what a prophet's reward is to be a
[1:33:10] friend to the prophet see that's the
[1:33:13] reward he is your friend like a mighty
[1:33:16] woman it might come in hand sometimes
[1:33:18] see it didn't with her see what he got
[1:33:21] his servants
[1:33:24] aha
[1:33:25] oh you have been following there that is
[1:33:28] right so someone asked brother brought
[1:33:32] him a question
[1:33:33] to explain where I have been reading
[1:33:37] she did that on our behalf
[1:33:40] it is like when
[1:33:43] Paul said but he must remember that in
[1:33:47] the any time perias times will come
[1:33:49] timof is not here
[1:33:54] amen so that was for us because we are
[1:33:59] the ones who are living in the end time
[1:34:02] so that question was asked on your
[1:34:04] behalf because
[1:34:07] many people would deviate from the line
[1:34:12] during the any time and we have seen it
[1:34:15] it is happening they are going astray
[1:34:19] from the line
[1:34:21] they are making it complicated to God
[1:34:25] to send his rewards his promises to let
[1:34:30] it go through and the God cannot
[1:34:32] contradict himself
[1:34:36] praise the Lord
[1:34:38] he cannot contradict his system always
[1:34:42] remains good and perfect and he wants it
[1:34:46] to run that way
[1:34:49] amen so she asked the prophet
[1:34:53] a question
[1:34:55] then he brought an example like a
[1:34:57] shunamite woman so that means it's like
[1:35:01] this
[1:35:04] becoming a friend
[1:35:07] is another level
[1:35:11] when God made Abraham to be his friend
[1:35:14] it was another level
[1:35:19] when Jesus made the disciples to be his
[1:35:22] friends it was another level
[1:35:28] so becoming a friend is a level that you
[1:35:32] have been elevated to after being tried
[1:35:36] and I have been proven to be true
[1:35:45] I must try and I was proven to be true
[1:35:50] and the god called him Abraham is my
[1:35:53] friend
[1:35:54] and can I hide him anything that I'm
[1:35:57] about to do
[1:36:00] so when we become God's friends
[1:36:03] he cannot hide anything to do
[1:36:07] he reveals everything to us
[1:36:11] because we are his friends
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:16] so when God makes
[1:36:18] a prophet to be his friend
[1:36:21] then a prophet also says I will make
[1:36:24] more friends for you
[1:36:28] if our Prophet becomes God is a friend
[1:36:31] then we also who receives his message we
[1:36:36] become God's friends
[1:36:38] Korea
[1:36:41] praise the Lord
[1:36:45] even the Book of James he proves the
[1:36:48] same that God called Abraham his friend
[1:36:54] in the book of second Chronicles chapter
[1:36:56] 20 verse 7
[1:36:58] the Bible says art not thou Our God who
[1:37:02] did his drive out
[1:37:04] to the inhabitants of this land before
[1:37:06] thy People Israel and I gave a city to
[1:37:09] the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever
[1:37:12] that's now uh one witness think that
[1:37:16] another witness Isaiah 41 verse 8 but
[1:37:20] thou Israel at my servant Jacob whom I
[1:37:23] have chosen the seed of Abram my friend
[1:37:27] that's another second witness another
[1:37:30] sadly Witness
[1:37:32] James chapter 2 verse 23 and the
[1:37:35] scripture was fulfilled which says Abram
[1:37:37] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[1:37:41] for righteousness and that he was called
[1:37:44] the friend of God
[1:37:48] okay
[1:37:50] that's another level
[1:37:53] now here comes our prophet
[1:37:56] answering like that
[1:37:58] then he refers to a shuna matuma so then
[1:38:02] we go back at the sunamite woman what
[1:38:05] happened
[1:38:06] she
[1:38:08] she had no account
[1:38:11] they were getting all the stricken old
[1:38:14] no child but her advice was
[1:38:18] hey my husband
[1:38:21] we have believed in God's word we are
[1:38:24] believing God is Prophet but why can't
[1:38:26] we line up and become a friend to a
[1:38:30] prophet maybe something hard can happen
[1:38:33] maybe we can get a reward
[1:38:35] understands she lined up
[1:38:38] when she lined up because number one God
[1:38:42] is a perfect true God
[1:38:45] second his Prophet are always true
[1:38:48] Prophets then she knew that if I can
[1:38:51] line up there's nothing impossible
[1:38:55] then she made
[1:38:57] Elisha to be a friend and then she also
[1:39:02] became a friend of God can I hide can I
[1:39:05] refuse your anything
[1:39:07] since she's in the life and I can see
[1:39:09] the conduit is a perfect shoe he sent
[1:39:12] the reward to her
[1:39:15] even when they tell it again
[1:39:18] things went
[1:39:21] I tell you what we do is stay in the
[1:39:25] line
[1:39:31] praise the Lord
[1:39:33] what do we do
[1:39:35] we don't want shortcuts
[1:39:38] we can go back
[1:39:40] can we go back again in the book of
[1:39:44] First Kings chapter 17 we shall read
[1:39:47] verses 2 verse 5 and verse 15.
[1:39:52] verse 5 and verse 15. okay as we go
[1:39:56] there
[1:39:57] put that then we can see verse 5.
[1:40:00] verse 5 is going to say
[1:40:03] he went
[1:40:06] yes
[1:40:08] First Kings 17 verse 5.
[1:40:11] 17 verse 5.
[1:40:14] the Bible says
[1:40:16] so he went and I did it according unto
[1:40:19] the word of the Lord
[1:40:21] that is Elijah
[1:40:23] now let's go verse 15.
[1:40:26] this is you now
[1:40:29] whoever will receive that is you now and
[1:40:32] as she went and I did according to the
[1:40:34] saying of Elijah
[1:40:36] so you see she did not jump
[1:40:41] she followed the message
[1:40:44] Hallelujah
[1:40:47] she respected the word of God
[1:40:50] she respected the prophet of God
[1:40:54] she gave him food or not
[1:40:57] so that she cannot contradict herself
[1:41:00] she knew that as long as that word is
[1:41:05] from God she believed it
[1:41:11] she did not jump
[1:41:13] she don't call herself wise she did not
[1:41:16] blame she did not correct she did not
[1:41:19] assume she did not say ah he's a false
[1:41:23] prophet no
[1:41:27] praise the Lord
[1:41:30] that is how things must go my dear
[1:41:33] friends and the sisters we are seeing
[1:41:35] things going by Zach different in this
[1:41:38] anytime people are getting tired
[1:41:41] of waiting
[1:41:43] they are deviating from the line
[1:41:46] and then therefore when they do that
[1:41:48] they are missing their Rewards
[1:41:54] if they miss that the economists even
[1:41:56] rapture
[1:42:00] because Paul said like this in the book
[1:42:02] of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 35 says
[1:42:06] cast not our confidence
[1:42:10] your confidence which has agreed
[1:42:13] reward
[1:42:16] so when he says cast not away there are
[1:42:19] some things that are really threatening
[1:42:23] the bride or the Believers until they
[1:42:27] are tired they want to raise up they
[1:42:29] want to surrender don't surrender
[1:42:35] don't surrender even if you see people
[1:42:39] are going getting away they are tired
[1:42:42] but God's word is still perfect
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:49] here's the system is still the same
[1:42:52] here's the system is still very good
[1:42:55] we can't do anything outside over the
[1:42:58] system
[1:43:01] pray the Lord
[1:43:04] let's see somewhere where
[1:43:07] the Lord is again blaming he's blaming
[1:43:10] the receivers they are refusing to line
[1:43:13] up and then he's blaming them
[1:43:15] in the Book of Luke chapter 4 verse 24
[1:43:18] let's read
[1:43:20] Luke 4 24
[1:43:22] bring for us Luke 24 chapter 4 verse 24
[1:43:26] he is blaming them then we shall read
[1:43:29] the verse 24 25 and 26.
[1:43:39] look
[1:43:41] okay
[1:43:45] chapter four let me see
[1:43:48] okay
[1:43:50] and I said
[1:43:53] verily I said to you no Prophet is
[1:43:55] accepted in his own country he is
[1:43:59] blaming them already
[1:44:01] he's there
[1:44:03] he wants them to line up they are not
[1:44:05] sick
[1:44:06] this is written the book of Deuteronomy
[1:44:08] you are God
[1:44:10] shall rise up a prophet like you Moses
[1:44:14] whoever will not listen to him
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:18] so they don't want to listen to him
[1:44:21] he is there in the room of a prophet
[1:44:24] fulfilling the scripture but they are
[1:44:27] not listening
[1:44:29] he want to give them some memory words
[1:44:36] that's why brother Brahma said
[1:44:39] many miracles we are done by Jesus
[1:44:41] that's true
[1:44:45] many miracles would have been done by
[1:44:48] Jesus but because they did not believe
[1:44:51] in him
[1:44:54] they deviated from the line from the
[1:44:57] system
[1:44:59] goddess system is
[1:45:01] three Perfection another three is he God
[1:45:06] prophet
[1:45:08] the you all of you stand in the line
[1:45:12] amen and amen
[1:45:16] but when God sends their blessings you
[1:45:19] he sends the reward and then you you do
[1:45:22] like this
[1:45:23] then God says Ah no no how am I going to
[1:45:25] send it
[1:45:30] praise the Lord
[1:45:33] there's a prophet there's a prophet who
[1:45:36] wanted it to stand in the middle
[1:45:39] just to cut the blessings of children of
[1:45:42] Israel we call him balam
[1:45:44] he said oh then back
[1:45:48] the king of
[1:45:50] uh there was a moabs or whatever he came
[1:45:55] and I said ah
[1:45:56] I can see God he can't do anything
[1:45:59] can you come understand in the middle
[1:46:02] so that he can send the castings
[1:46:06] to devour these people away
[1:46:08] so when he came
[1:46:10] God said no
[1:46:13] since you are a prophet
[1:46:16] I will make that office at good
[1:46:19] you are self you are not good but in
[1:46:22] that office
[1:46:25] amen yeah you know pray the Lord
[1:46:29] so you cannot stray the trophies
[1:46:35] God said when you stood there and then
[1:46:38] he was ready to cast and the God said
[1:46:40] then the the the power came and he said
[1:46:42] oh no I know Israel no one he was too
[1:46:47] cast but he didn't because
[1:46:49] why because God don't want wrong things
[1:46:53] to be in that light
[1:46:59] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] okay
[1:47:05] I was saying
[1:47:08] Luke chapter 4
[1:47:10] verse 24
[1:47:12] here is a prophet he is a true prophet
[1:47:16] and now I want these people to stand in
[1:47:19] their life
[1:47:21] they are refusing under he wants to
[1:47:23] remind them
[1:47:25] he wants to remind them
[1:47:28] like he reminded others about Sodom and
[1:47:31] the Gomorrah
[1:47:34] when they refuse he can remind them now
[1:47:37] he wants to meet them about that woman
[1:47:39] what did she do
[1:47:42] let's read
[1:47:45] verse 25
[1:47:47] but I tell you of the truth many widows
[1:47:51] were in Israel in the days of Elias
[1:47:54] when the heaven is worshiped up three
[1:47:57] years and the six months when great
[1:48:00] feminine was throughout all the land
[1:48:03] but unto none of them was Elias sent
[1:48:06] save unto serapita a city of sidon and
[1:48:09] to a woman that was a widow you see
[1:48:13] Jesus is reminding them
[1:48:16] and I said if you can look back
[1:48:19] you would understand what is happening
[1:48:21] right now
[1:48:23] and I would stand in the line
[1:48:27] but is reminding them their eyes were
[1:48:29] blinded they did not see
[1:48:35] even today many Pentecostals Methodist
[1:48:38] you tell them what is happening today
[1:48:40] let us stand in the line they don't see
[1:48:47] they want to jump and they say we know
[1:48:49] God
[1:48:50] they don't want the middle god is
[1:48:53] perfect
[1:48:54] three is a perfect number
[1:48:57] whoever that's you receive a prophet
[1:49:01] that's number two
[1:49:03] and then who sent who said his number so
[1:49:06] we must be three three three three three
[1:49:09] my dear brothers and the sisters
[1:49:12] therefore you are not in the wrong place
[1:49:16] you are in the right place
[1:49:19] according to the scriptures
[1:49:22] you are in the right place
[1:49:24] honored that to keep your mind in the
[1:49:27] mid uh in the life
[1:49:30] don't listen to other voices
[1:49:34] praise the Lord
[1:49:38] He also mentioned Naman let's go
[1:49:41] all these little people that they
[1:49:44] mentioned
[1:49:45] the message
[1:49:47] brought their life to a better life
[1:49:51] that woman ate that she lived
[1:49:55] is going to be let's read let's read
[1:50:00] he's reminding us
[1:50:03] uh-huh
[1:50:05] verse 26
[1:50:08] I'm in verse 27.
[1:50:10] Adams
[1:50:13] Where in Israel in the time of Elias
[1:50:17] the prophet
[1:50:19] and none of them was clear saving Naman
[1:50:22] the Syrian
[1:50:24] you see he's also mentioning Naman the
[1:50:26] Syria
[1:50:27] Naman is a gentile
[1:50:30] we are the Gentiles
[1:50:33] we are not a Jews
[1:50:36] we are the Normans
[1:50:39] we are the Normans
[1:50:42] especially today
[1:50:44] who who cannot see when the prophet face
[1:50:47] to face
[1:50:49] a prophet speaks from inside the house
[1:50:52] you hear just The Voice
[1:50:56] so what what am I saying we go back at
[1:51:00] the store of Naman what happened
[1:51:05] from Israel
[1:51:07] God used her
[1:51:09] and she tells the mistress
[1:51:12] stress
[1:51:14] can you tell Dad tell my master
[1:51:18] that if he can you know she did not
[1:51:21] mention that but I'm the one mentioning
[1:51:23] it but it's the same thing
[1:51:25] if we can go in Israel I'd line up
[1:51:29] behind the prophet
[1:51:32] he will receive the reward
[1:51:37] amen then went
[1:51:41] then when he went
[1:51:44] he thought those things can be also
[1:51:46] bribed by money how much you have
[1:51:49] or how much gifts you have I tell you
[1:51:53] God's gift is free
[1:51:59] and that is his love
[1:52:02] so
[1:52:03] pick out the things under whatever maybe
[1:52:06] he put on his uniform with all the ranks
[1:52:08] the stars and everything and they also
[1:52:12] had to go with some escorts and so on
[1:52:15] why it's because he is a someone of a
[1:52:20] great Lanka he is visiting another
[1:52:22] Nation so he has to go with everything
[1:52:25] then he went and when he went he did not
[1:52:29] go and line up behind the prophet so he
[1:52:32] thought maybe these are political issues
[1:52:34] where they have something they can help
[1:52:36] him because uh you know in this world
[1:52:39] Kings or presidents they also seek for
[1:52:42] some assistances too
[1:52:45] so he went there
[1:52:47] and when the prophet of Israel I mean
[1:52:49] Kingdom of Israel he saw that he cried
[1:52:52] because that was another section that he
[1:52:55] cannot do
[1:52:57] those are things that pertains only with
[1:53:00] Prophets
[1:53:04] but good enough
[1:53:07] the rumors wreaked
[1:53:09] Elias
[1:53:11] and I said
[1:53:13] send him here
[1:53:16] that he may stand behind
[1:53:19] and we line up
[1:53:23] then he came
[1:53:25] so when he came
[1:53:27] what happened
[1:53:30] Eliza did not come out
[1:53:35] so that this mind can gain Faith by
[1:53:38] looking at him no
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:42] Elise I wanted him
[1:53:45] to believe this spoken word
[1:53:48] [Applause]
[1:53:51] Hallelujah
[1:53:54] so he hid himself inside the house
[1:53:58] and I said he must believe the word
[1:54:04] and line up
[1:54:06] and I said what is he saying
[1:54:10] what is he who's that prophet
[1:54:13] and who is behind him God praise the
[1:54:17] Lord
[1:54:20] so then he came
[1:54:21] so any Rick the premise says it there
[1:54:24] and then the prophet spoke
[1:54:27] go and
[1:54:29] borrow yourself
[1:54:31] seven times into Jordan
[1:54:34] ah he said that's that's a different
[1:54:37] Doctrine
[1:54:40] amen and we don't do things like that
[1:54:44] ah then he started comparing ah we have
[1:54:47] Urban the beautiful river that we have
[1:54:50] decorated which is so beautiful it has
[1:54:54] no even crashes or maybe ah then he
[1:54:59] started comparing right
[1:55:01] you see God is things you have to follow
[1:55:04] what
[1:55:06] obedient when a prophet tells you
[1:55:08] something do it do it
[1:55:12] as he said to the shunamite woman
[1:55:16] ah
[1:55:18] so
[1:55:19] then when he was doing like that then
[1:55:22] when God looked at the line he said uh I
[1:55:25] want to heal this man
[1:55:27] but it is still outside the line
[1:55:30] and I can't I don't do shortcuts
[1:55:35] until you do what I want
[1:55:38] right but then the Bible says God we are
[1:55:43] co-workers together with him
[1:55:46] and the Bible says
[1:55:49] the common people had Jesus gladly
[1:55:53] it's because
[1:55:54] they didn't see any greatness they have
[1:55:57] they just knew all by God is the grace
[1:56:00] it's like we here
[1:56:02] God is so nothing good in us but by his
[1:56:05] grace he saved us
[1:56:07] by his grace he loved us
[1:56:10] that is it
[1:56:12] those are the common people
[1:56:14] you see for them they say oh we don't
[1:56:17] have any greatness whatever but we just
[1:56:19] follow Jesus and he loves us and
[1:56:21] whatever that is true
[1:56:23] so good enough no money had to travel
[1:56:26] with the common people who can
[1:56:29] understand very well the message of
[1:56:31] Elijah
[1:56:34] then they turned around and they said so
[1:56:38] maybe they gave him all those kind of
[1:56:41] respects and so on if a prophet tells
[1:56:44] you to do something
[1:56:46] can't you do sir you do it
[1:56:49] because
[1:56:51] this is not Syria
[1:56:53] this is not our country
[1:56:56] this is different and and under the one
[1:56:59] above that is God himself he knows how
[1:57:01] to make his laws
[1:57:03] maybe why can't you
[1:57:06] oh I they convinced him until he came in
[1:57:11] the line
[1:57:13] coming in the line is to go and do
[1:57:16] according to the saying of the prophet
[1:57:23] then he went to Jordan
[1:57:26] because Jordan has a meaning says Jordan
[1:57:29] means death
[1:57:32] and a true life
[1:57:35] because there's a court because we don't
[1:57:36] have time but this quote about that
[1:57:39] yeah they are
[1:57:42] we shall read just few and then we're
[1:57:44] about to finish okay
[1:57:46] he says like this
[1:57:49] let's read
[1:57:52] uh
[1:57:56] letting of pressure
[1:57:59] letting off pressure at the message
[1:58:00] letting of pressure
[1:58:03] he says
[1:58:05] now one day the human race
[1:58:07] was in a truck
[1:58:10] under there comes someone to the Earth
[1:58:13] by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:58:16] Jesus mean is Jehovah
[1:58:18] savior
[1:58:19] and he went down the Jordan
[1:58:24] of death
[1:58:26] went over the Jordan
[1:58:29] any death
[1:58:31] and raise up on Easter morning
[1:58:34] with the evidence that a man can live
[1:58:39] after he dies
[1:58:41] Hallelujah death is not the end Jesus
[1:58:46] proved it
[1:58:47] that a man can live after he died
[1:58:52] so you see now Naman must live again
[1:58:56] with a good life
[1:58:58] but he must go where the symbol means he
[1:59:02] must go to Jordan
[1:59:07] not in his own River in their area no
[1:59:11] not in something another substitute no
[1:59:15] if a prophet saying to your dad it must
[1:59:18] be Jordan
[1:59:19] and when he said 70 times it must be 70
[1:59:23] times
[1:59:24] there is no question why why can't it be
[1:59:27] free sir no
[1:59:30] you don't say three or four it must be
[1:59:33] seven
[1:59:34] because everything that God does or he
[1:59:38] says has a meaning
[1:59:42] purpose
[1:59:47] praise the Lord
[1:59:50] then he went
[1:59:52] and they dipped himself
[1:59:55] seven times
[1:59:58] after that
[2:00:00] he received a changed the body
[2:00:04] Hallelujah
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] he received that changing the body
[2:00:11] we want to receive change the bodies
[2:00:16] but what we do is to remain lining up
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:23] in the line
[2:00:25] and the follow God's instructions
[2:00:29] we need not to reason
[2:00:32] or to complain or whatever
[2:00:35] already has to be obedient
[2:00:39] amen and we need not to say
[2:00:41] we want him to come back
[2:00:44] brother Branham to come back and preach
[2:00:46] again for what
[2:00:51] he is in the house that's enough
[2:00:53] we need to just a voice
[2:00:59] praise the Lord
[2:01:01] yeah
[2:01:04] that's how we can gain our faith
[2:01:07] is just believing what a prophet said
[2:01:15] then someone say oh
[2:01:17] if I hear I wish I could have been the
[2:01:20] time of brother brothers
[2:01:22] held me of this sickness I tell you just
[2:01:26] stay in the line
[2:01:28] the reward shall come
[2:01:31] things will flow
[2:01:34] amen what you do is to tell God God I
[2:01:38] have not deviated from the right
[2:01:41] I am in the life
[2:01:47] look at that woman in Memphis
[2:01:50] down there
[2:01:52] that black woman
[2:01:55] that's right
[2:01:56] she had the faith in God she prayed the
[2:02:00] whole night but God is saying the only
[2:02:02] way how can I flow the reward or a
[2:02:07] miracle
[2:02:09] I want you to line up behind the prophet
[2:02:12] amen amen I want to be alive
[2:02:16] and I can do anything
[2:02:18] I can even ground the planes not to go
[2:02:22] praise the Lord
[2:02:23] and that happened
[2:02:25] and the problem said I can hear someone
[2:02:28] saying go go go then I said where am I
[2:02:30] going
[2:02:31] but he's saying go go go
[2:02:34] there is a woman who is waiting for you
[2:02:38] she's waiting to line up
[2:02:41] she wants a reward
[2:02:44] she has a problem
[2:02:48] and when he went
[2:02:50] and she believed
[2:02:54] in the Bible
[2:02:57] who knows he says oh yeah that's true
[2:03:00] yeah
[2:03:02] and they lined up
[2:03:06] and our son was healed
[2:03:13] monster hearty
[2:03:15] when a prophet was picking something
[2:03:19] about the screw hunting
[2:03:21] oh she responded to pick you up praise
[2:03:25] the Lord there's nothing God With God
[2:03:27] that word made God happy because when
[2:03:31] God looked down the other men were there
[2:03:34] but they were still
[2:03:35] ah doubting a bit how can it be but when
[2:03:39] she responded so quickly that means she
[2:03:42] is turning the line so quickly
[2:03:45] and when God looked the line is so
[2:03:47] perfect he said ah what else again
[2:03:50] please I'm a true God you're a true
[2:03:53] Prophet tell her what she needs and I
[2:03:55] will send to her
[2:04:00] I want salvation of my two kids there it
[2:04:04] happened
[2:04:07] praise the Lord
[2:04:10] brothers and assistance
[2:04:12] we need to stay in the life
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] people are tired they are going astray I
[2:04:21] have seen that is happening in the whole
[2:04:22] world but a very good picture in the
[2:04:25] Bible is there we shall receive a
[2:04:28] prophet is the reward as long as we stay
[2:04:31] behind the message
[2:04:32] God bless you tonight
[2:04:37] [Applause]
[2:04:46] ah I love him
[2:04:50] ah

[2:12:15] three types of birds we saw Ravens
[2:12:19] we saw eagles and we saw seagulls it was
[2:12:23] so tremendous because you know you had a
[2:12:25] one-third chance to see an eagle flying
[2:12:27] we were able to feed them just to watch
