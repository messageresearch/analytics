[27:38] welcome to the house of the Lord once
[27:40] again
[27:41] on a Wednesday evening
[27:44] beautiful spring day
[27:47] we have more birds passing through
[27:51] what a tremendous opportunity it is to
[27:55] be here tonight
[27:57] his living representation here on Earth
[28:01] and we know I think we said it on Sunday
[28:03] as the birds change their song because
[28:06] they can sense the seasons change
[28:09] how the bride changes her song
[28:12] she can recognize the change in the
[28:15] season as well
[28:17] what an amazing time we live
[28:21] we have a couple of announcements
[28:22] tonight before we get into the word
[28:28] brother Mila and sister in this
[28:31] kakuji
[28:32] announce the birth of their baby girl
[28:39] sister Mila Jermaine kakuji was born
[28:43] I should have offered a picture maybe
[28:46] I'll just check with a brother
[28:48] and we'll see if we can share some
[28:49] pictures she's an absolute sweetheart
[28:52] just a beautiful little girl
[28:55] we want to do a baby dedication when the
[28:58] rotation comes around next we'll see
[29:01] we'll try and work that out
[29:03] we have a brother in the city that would
[29:05] like to fellowship with us
[29:07] he's been around the message for I think
[29:09] just over a year now
[29:11] he picked it up in Dublin Ireland he
[29:14] heard about the word in an online Bible
[29:16] study
[29:18] goes to show this online thing there's
[29:20] nothing going to stop the word of God
[29:24] he's going to blow every single one of
[29:25] our paradigms the way that we think
[29:27] things should be maybe the way things
[29:30] were done all the way along in the past
[29:32] we're going to throw those things away
[29:34] and we're going to move forward and he's
[29:36] going to force us he's not going to
[29:38] force us but he's going to cause us to
[29:41] actually get into him and forget about
[29:43] all the things that that maybe would
[29:45] hold us down and give us the opportunity
[29:48] to just be free and completely liberated
[29:51] in him so we want to welcome a brother
[29:53] named Fergus Howard
[29:55] I've been communicating with them I will
[29:58] meet with him this week and we'll we'll
[30:00] just see what the Lord will do we'll add
[30:02] added him to a list in one of the groups
[30:05] and we'll see see how things go
[30:08] um perhaps if he's good with it we'll
[30:10] pass out his contact information I'm
[30:12] sure he would love to fellowship with
[30:14] believers
[30:16] so we'll just see how that goes pray for
[30:18] brother Howard Fergus Howard and uh just
[30:21] remember him in prayer
[30:24] there's a few things that we'd like to
[30:26] talk about uh in terms of housekeeping
[30:28] but we'll get into that a bit later
[30:29] maybe on Sunday
[30:32] [Music]
[30:33] um prayer request tonight
[30:36] we just have praise reports tonight
[30:39] and I just think how how fitting for a
[30:42] service like this
[30:44] sister Charmaine is at home and well
[30:47] blessed be the name of the Lord
[30:49] [Music]
[30:53] spoke to my dad today I've spoke to him
[30:55] every day just about and uh he said his
[30:58] eyesight in his left eye is back
[31:07] I have a little quote that I want to
[31:09] read before we get too far
[31:11] down the road and you know what's sort
[31:14] of been on my heart the background to it
[31:16] all talking about church order brothers
[31:18] and sisters is about what we're
[31:19] experiencing right here tonight and
[31:22] that's Revival that's having an
[31:25] excitement for the word it's not just a
[31:27] mundane service it's not just an
[31:29] ordinary everyday Wednesday night
[31:32] service in the middle of the week just
[31:33] because that's what we do it's because
[31:35] we get to go to the house of the Lord
[31:36] and meet with him and all he wants is a
[31:39] sincere heart like brother Toby said
[31:40] it's so true we have such an opportunity
[31:44] to fellowship with the Lord Revival is
[31:47] what I'm looking for brothers and
[31:49] sisters and I know that we're not
[31:50] talking about the World Revival brother
[31:52] Bradham says it very clearly that's over
[31:54] but there's still a Revival in the bride
[31:56] it's an individual Revival every single
[31:59] day of Our Lives to understand the
[32:01] reason we have breath is because he put
[32:03] it there and he put it there for a
[32:06] purpose not just so that we can take air
[32:08] oxygen out of this world and consume
[32:11] minerals it's so that we can be a
[32:13] representation a living witness of him
[32:15] on Earth in our age
[32:18] it's quotes out of Jehovah Jireh in 1962
[32:22] striking at the women and men both last
[32:25] night and seeing them in respect to the
[32:28] word
[32:29] seeing them stand up and admit they're
[32:31] wrong
[32:32] [Music]
[32:34] want God's forgiveness
[32:36] and to go on
[32:38] brother Bradham says this is the place
[32:42] to have Revival
[32:45] when we're willing to forgive
[32:47] when we're willing to have hearts that
[32:49] say I'm wrong
[32:52] how do we actually cause forgiveness in
[32:55] a relationship it's to admit that we're
[32:58] wrong if we go into a a conversation to
[33:01] say I'm you know I made a mistake but
[33:04] you know I'm a human and I just make
[33:05] mistakes
[33:06] what's that gonna do in the relationship
[33:08] as a friend or or to our wife or to
[33:11] whoever it is we have to have a humble
[33:13] heart we have to come with that approach
[33:15] brothers and sisters he says this is the
[33:18] place to have Revival if there'd be any
[33:21] Revival I know of it had happened right
[33:23] along here where Honest Hearts why
[33:28] you've got something to work on see
[33:30] something most of them will get arrogant
[33:33] they don't want you to tell them about
[33:35] it just remember that type of a seed is
[33:37] a denominational seat but we're not
[33:39] talking to denominational seeds here
[33:41] tonight he says not a Seed of Abraham a
[33:44] Seed of Abraham sees the word and
[33:46] believes the word quickly
[33:50] Brothers and Sisters Let's have a
[33:52] Revival
[33:55] it doesn't have to be in the church it
[33:56] doesn't have to be a Pentecostal thing
[33:58] I'm not looking for that I want to see
[34:00] every single one of our brothers and
[34:02] sisters have complete Liberty in the
[34:04] word and have complete Liberty with the
[34:06] Lord in their lives and in their homes
[34:09] and in their families and not be bound
[34:10] by anything that could bind us Up and
[34:13] Hold Us Down
[34:15] blessed be the name of the Lord let's go
[34:17] to him in prayer tonight if you do have
[34:19] a need just make it known with an
[34:21] uplifted hand gracious Heavenly Father
[34:23] Lord we just want to come to you with
[34:25] sincere Hearts tonight as our brother
[34:27] prayed father Lord we don't want to have
[34:30] anything hiding in the background Lord

[34:35] in any way father we pray that you would
[34:38] just meet every single need represented
[34:39] by the uplifted hand tonight father and
[34:42] as our brother prayed we we just ask
[34:44] that you would do something special for
[34:46] us tonight Lord that this wouldn't be
[34:48] just an ordinary service and Lord I know
[34:51] for sure that that's exactly what you
[34:53] had planned before our brother prayed it
[34:55] because tonight it is different father
[34:58] we just love you and we thank you and we
[35:00] bless your name one more time you have
[35:02] already Vindicated your word Lord Jesus
[35:05] already shown the confirmation for this
[35:08] direction so father I'm excited we're

[35:38] special thank you to all the musicians
[35:41] who bring of their gifts every single
[35:43] service week after week
[35:46] not just here but at Lethbridge
[35:49] so many different opportunities
[35:53] tonight we're definitely taking a
[35:55] different direction
[35:57] if you could turn in your Bibles to John
[35:58] chapter 8.
[36:00] [Music]
[36:05] John chapter 8
[36:07] I trust it's a familiar scripture
[36:12] and I just we got into it a little while
[36:14] ago in in terms of studying and it just
[36:17] spoke to me so strongly
[36:22] John chapter 8 verse 1.
[36:26] Jesus
[36:28] went unto the Mount of Olives
[36:31] and early in the morning he came again
[36:33] to the temple
[36:35] and all the people came unto him and he
[36:38] sat down
[36:39] and taught them
[36:41] and the scribes and Pharisees brought
[36:44] unto him a woman taken in adultery
[36:47] and when they had set her in the midst
[36:51] they said unto him Master this woman was
[36:53] taken in adultery in the very Act
[36:56] now Moses in the law commanded us that
[37:00] such
[37:01] should be stoned
[37:04] but what sayeth thou
[37:08] this said they this they said tempting
[37:10] him
[37:11] that they might have to accuse him
[37:16] but Jesus stooped down and with his
[37:18] finger
[37:19] wrote on the ground
[37:22] as though he heard them not
[37:25] so when they continued asking him
[37:28] he lifted up himself and said unto them
[37:31] he that is without sin among you let him
[37:34] first cast a stone at her
[37:38] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[37:40] the ground
[37:42] and they which heard it being convicted
[37:44] by their own conscience went out one by
[37:48] one
[37:49] beginning at the eldest even unto the
[37:52] last
[37:53] and Jesus was left alone
[37:56] and the woman standing in the midst
[38:00] and when Jesus lifted up himself and saw
[38:03] none but the woman
[38:05] he said unto her
[38:08] woman
[38:10] where are those thine accusers
[38:16] hath no man condemned thee
[38:19] she said no man Lord
[38:23] and Jesus said unto her
[38:25] neither do I condemn thee
[38:28] go and sin no more
[38:32] let's just bow in prayer
[38:34] gracious Heavenly Father
[38:37] Lord tonight we know that you've
[38:39] inspired this word
[38:41] tonight you've inspired this word to be
[38:43] spoken father this word was inspired
[38:46] thousands of years ago we know that but
[38:49] Lord Jesus what good is it a thousand
[38:51] years ago it has to be alive today and
[38:55] Father we just thank you that you have
[38:57] given us Revelation about this word for
[39:00] our day and Lord we don't make ourselves
[39:03] anything if anything this humbles us
[39:05] because we know that is the word that
[39:07] you speak to your bride even tonight
[39:10] so father we pray that you would just
[39:12] take the words that are spoken tonight
[39:13] and speak to us sovereignly Lord Jesus
[39:15] as our brother prayed already we thank
[39:18] you for meeting his prayer because when
[39:20] we leave this building tonight this will
[39:22] not be a normal ordinary service and
[39:25] father we're just excited to see the
[39:27] Liberty that you have in store for us
[39:29] Blessed Be Your Name we just ask that
[39:32] you would bless this word now father to
[39:33] each and every one of us in Jesus
[39:35] Christ's name we pray amen amen God
[39:39] bless you tonight you may be seated
[39:42] what a privilege it is it just was
[39:45] bouncing around in my head
[39:47] over the last little while thinking
[39:49] about the uh the the temple and and and
[39:52] uh and and the exact order that God laid
[39:56] out for the children of Israel in the
[39:58] wilderness and and and then to have the
[40:00] the the the the the Brick and Mortar
[40:02] temple built by Solomon for the Lord and
[40:06] to implement the exact same measures but
[40:08] but the exacting description the the
[40:12] instructions to build the temple and
[40:13] then to execute the the positions in the
[40:16] offices in the temple
[40:18] how complicated
[40:20] how extremely complicated to build to
[40:23] maintain and then to execute the offices
[40:26] and and and here we are tonight here we
[40:29] are every day of Our Lives we have the
[40:31] ability to enter into the the most holy
[40:34] Place commonly referred to as the
[40:36] holiest of holies
[40:38] but the word calls it the most holy
[40:40] place behind the inner Veil
[40:43] one more time here we are brothers and
[40:45] sisters
[40:47] and to be
[40:49] behind the pulpit called The Sacred desk
[40:52] to think that we have something to bring
[40:54] to feed the children of God it's
[40:58] it's daunting sometimes
[41:00] but he always comes through
[41:03] I thought I had thoughts when I came to
[41:06] the church this afternoon
[41:08] but I'll tell you it completely changed
[41:12] sometimes there's a little change but
[41:14] today was just totally different
[41:18] tonight I want to talk about
[41:20] aren't accusers
[41:24] what a powerful scripture this is
[41:27] we could just talk about this scripture
[41:30] I feel like in in terms of just reading
[41:33] it and and you know Jesus standing up
[41:35] and saying woman where are those thine
[41:38] accusers
[41:39] hath no man condemned me condemned thee
[41:43] and you know brother Branham he preaches
[41:45] the indictment and and what he does is
[41:48] is he discredits
[41:50] he discredits the accusers in that
[41:53] message he totally disassembles
[41:57] the prosecution
[42:00] and he does the same thing right here
[42:02] woman where are those line accusers
[42:04] because he who has no sin just go ahead
[42:08] you can be the one just go and cast the
[42:10] first stone that that one of you who is
[42:12] perfect without sin
[42:14] tonight I don't want to talk about that
[42:16] what I do want to talk about is is is
[42:19] getting more so into the way the Lord
[42:22] views the church
[42:24] um mixing things and and bringing things
[42:26] in and and getting mixed up with with
[42:29] different ideologies and and things that
[42:31] can so easily beset us and and cause the
[42:35] word of God to be of none effect
[42:38] it's kind of the curse of the age the
[42:40] the laodicean church to be lukewarm
[42:42] formal and Powerless
[42:44] and and none of us wants to be there
[42:48] but I I just believe the Lord totally
[42:50] brought us this way so let's let's go
[42:53] you know let's turn over to Genesis
[42:54] chapter one
[43:01] Genesis chapter 1.
[43:03] sort of the I don't even know what you
[43:05] call it the context maybe of the thought
[43:10] would be just just talking about
[43:12] adultery and I believe that this this is
[43:15] going a direction that has many many
[43:17] many different directions from this
[43:21] direction and uh and and we're going to
[43:24] see what the Lord has his story here I'm
[43:26] excited about it but in Genesis chapter
[43:28] 1 verse 27 very familiar scripture where
[43:31] we're all very familiar with there might
[43:33] be some that aren't though so uh we'll
[43:36] just sort of try and set a background
[43:37] here Genesis 1 verse 27.
[43:41] so God created man in his own image
[43:45] in the image of God created he him
[43:48] male and female created he
[43:51] them
[43:52] now we know many times people will just
[43:55] read that like a newspaper and they'll
[43:57] just gloss right over it and they won't
[43:59] catch what's being said in the word and
[44:01] what's being said in the word was
[44:03] brought to us clearly by the prophet to
[44:05] say that this was a spiritual creation
[44:07] of man and woman they were one
[44:11] they weren't two separate beings at this
[44:13] point they were one and it was in spirit
[44:16] form that they were created both
[44:18] masculine and both feminine
[44:21] and that's exactly what the word says he
[44:23] created both male and female
[44:26] in spirit form then over in Chapter 2
[44:29] chapter 2 verse 7.
[44:32] just one page over
[44:34] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[44:37] of the ground and breathed into his
[44:39] nostrils the Breath of Life
[44:43] and a Man became a living soul
[44:46] and at this point that's where Man
[44:48] became a living Soul just like the word
[44:50] said that's where he became flesh and
[44:52] Bone
[44:53] that's where he was created out of the
[44:55] 16 elements that brother Bradham talks
[44:57] about that that that he creates a body
[44:59] from
[45:01] and then we go further
[45:04] we just I guess I just want to make this
[45:06] point that male and female are still in
[45:10] this body
[45:11] that hasn't changed the spirit form both
[45:14] masculine and feminine has now
[45:17] transformed into a body form with a
[45:20] living soul
[45:21] both masculine and feminine and then
[45:24] further over
[45:26] he takes the woman out of the man
[45:30] chapter 2 verse 21 to 23.
[45:36] verse 21 says on the Lord God caused a
[45:38] deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[45:40] slept
[45:41] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[45:44] up the flesh instead thereof
[45:47] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[45:49] from man made he a woman
[45:53] and brought her unto the man
[45:55] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[45:57] bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she
[46:00] shall be called woman because she was
[46:02] taken out of man
[46:05] verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his
[46:08] father and his mother and shall cleave
[46:09] unto his wife and they shall be one
[46:13] flesh
[46:14] and they were both naked and the man and
[46:16] his wife and they were not ashamed
[46:19] they were different creatures there
[46:22] that's that's the end of verse two we
[46:24] know that going into verse 3 chapter 3
[46:27] sorry the end of chapter 2 going into
[46:29] chapter 3 is where the curse happens
[46:31] tonight we're not going to get into that
[46:34] maybe down the road Lord willing we will
[46:36] but it was at this place that he he went
[46:39] so from the spirit masculine and
[46:41] feminine creation to the body masculine
[46:44] feminine creation to the actual
[46:47] splitting of the masculine and feminine
[46:49] out of the body
[46:51] man and woman
[46:52] becoming
[46:54] one and the other
[46:57] and we know I'm just going to sort of
[46:59] graze over some of this
[47:01] for those of us who know it but some
[47:03] might not God is the masculine in our
[47:07] world
[47:08] and the church
[47:10] the bride is the feminine
[47:13] when we talk about the bride when we
[47:15] talk about the church
[47:17] she's the feminine and really if you
[47:20] want to see a lot of inspiration for
[47:22] what I'm talking about tonight you can
[47:23] just go and Listen to Invisible Union of
[47:25] the Bride brother Branham talks about
[47:27] Romans how a woman how if she's married
[47:32] to another while her living while her
[47:34] husband yet lives she shall be called an
[47:37] adulteress
[47:38] and tonight I really want to try and
[47:41] talk about that word adultery and
[47:45] how important it is to realize that word
[47:48] adultery that the power that is there in
[47:51] that word not because we want to
[47:53] celebrate it because we don't want it
[47:55] we don't want it we want to make sure
[47:57] that we don't have it at all in our
[48:00] lives in our church in our families no
[48:03] adultery and you know there's the
[48:05] natural we just talked about it the
[48:07] spiritual and then the natural how God
[48:09] created it there's also the spiritual
[48:11] adultery and the natural adultery and
[48:13] neither one is acceptable
[48:16] but there's both
[48:18] but just to look at this scripture in
[48:20] John and the scribes and the Pharisees
[48:22] brought unto him a woman taken in
[48:24] adultery and when they had set her in
[48:26] the midst they said unto him Master this
[48:28] woman was taking an adultery in the very
[48:30] Act
[48:31] if you could just imagine the setting
[48:33] the situation in in the temple here he
[48:36] is teaching the people and now this
[48:38] sinner is brought and thrown right down
[48:40] at his feet and and said you know this
[48:42] this she's worthy of death
[48:46] and how many of us would fit that bill
[48:49] maybe not because of a natural adultery
[48:51] not not in the flesh maybe not but which
[48:54] is worse
[48:55] a physical adultery or a spiritual
[48:57] adultery I ask us tonight which is worse
[49:00] if we mix one word with the word
[49:03] we have committed spiritual fornication
[49:06] brothers and sisters
[49:07] to leave out or to add add in that's
[49:11] what that is
[49:12] we don't want to do that
[49:15] they said unto him Master this woman was
[49:17] taking an adultery in the very Act
[49:19] now Moses in the law commanded us that
[49:21] such should be stoned what saith thou
[49:24] try and put them on the spot
[49:27] but look at his actions here
[49:30] his actions are he just ignored them
[49:34] of course he heard them
[49:36] but he probably was groaning in himself
[49:39] laughing a little bit look at these
[49:41] fools they're coming to do this here
[49:44] they think they're going to trick me
[49:45] they think they're going to trap me here
[49:47] we go I'll can I'll I'll condescend to
[49:49] their level and and and we'll straighten
[49:52] them out and and just a couple words
[49:54] from the master a couple of words from
[49:56] the great Creator the one that we read
[49:58] about rolled all of the worlds off of
[50:00] his palms created everything into
[50:03] existence here he is and these guys are
[50:06] trying to trap him draw them in and trap
[50:08] them just think about how the accuser
[50:10] comes around if that is in front of the
[50:12] word what's it like for us as Believers
[50:15] how does the accuser go before the
[50:18] Brethren day and night trying to bring
[50:20] us down
[50:22] and trap us in adultery before the king
[50:26] saying the law says you should be
[50:28] condemned you should be stoned every one
[50:30] of us
[50:32] this they said tempting him that they
[50:35] might have to accuse him
[50:38] but Jesus stooped down and just wrote
[50:40] with his finger on the ground as though
[50:42] he heard them not
[50:44] you could imagine
[50:46] what he was writing
[50:49] pardoned
[50:51] pardoned
[50:55] so when they continued asking him he
[50:57] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[50:59] that's without sin
[51:01] he's whoever's the Holy One just go for
[51:04] it just cast the first stone
[51:05] you can have at her just do what you
[51:07] need to do
[51:10] and that was all it took one word from
[51:13] the master hey
[51:15] and right after that he stooped down
[51:16] like he didn't care just ignored them
[51:19] and it must have really really really
[51:21] really agitated him
[51:23] the most holy people the most educated
[51:25] people just being dismissed just being
[51:28] totally
[51:30] yeah whatever if you feel inclined you
[51:33] have no sin just go ahead you cast
[51:36] and it's amazing because they had every
[51:38] right to do it too
[51:41] didn't they according to the law
[51:44] but something in the master
[51:46] just like that night they went to get
[51:48] him out of the garden and he asked them
[51:51] who are you looking for
[51:53] and when he said that what did the word
[51:56] say they all fell backwards to the
[51:57] ground
[51:58] at the words of the master
[52:01] and he wasn't condemning them
[52:05] and they which heard it being convicted
[52:07] by their own conscience went out one by
[52:08] one beginning at the eldest even to the
[52:10] last and Jesus was left alone and the
[52:12] woman standing in the midst
[52:14] just can't help but think brothers and
[52:16] sisters this is going to be us
[52:18] and you know what it's not going to be
[52:20] it is
[52:22] truly every time we have fellowship with
[52:24] the Lord this is it
[52:27] we come with all these burdens in our
[52:29] heart knowing that we have to cast our
[52:32] poor souls at his feet because of all
[52:34] the accusations and all the sin and all
[52:37] the things that we've done wrong and all
[52:39] the accusers that are dogging us all the
[52:41] Devils that are trying to keep us from
[52:42] praying because we've done this or or
[52:44] we've done that all the terrible lives
[52:46] that we lived as Believers I don't know
[52:49] if you suffer from that but I do I
[52:51] surely do I have the devil on my back
[52:53] all the time telling me like there's no
[52:55] use praying why would you pray what
[52:57] God's it going to do you're a sinner
[52:59] he's not going to hear your prayer you
[53:01] know the word says that his ears are
[53:02] open every time we pray not just
[53:04] sometimes not just when we feel good not
[53:07] just when we look good not just when we
[53:10] do something good but every single time
[53:12] we pray he's listening intently and
[53:15] imagine how intently he's listening for
[53:17] his sons and daughters
[53:19] remember there's five wise and five
[53:21] foolage and and we don't want to throw
[53:23] off on anyone because they're all
[53:25] virgins the only difference is one one
[53:27] group had oil so brother and sister if
[53:30] we have oil in our Labs tonight we've
[53:32] got every single reason to rejoice and
[53:34] have a Revival because we know his ears
[53:36] are open to our prayers
[53:40] but when Jesus had lifted up himself and
[53:43] saw none but the woman he said unto her
[53:46] woman where are those thine accusers
[53:49] hath no man condemned me what happened
[53:52] here the room was full of people that
[53:54] just wanted to kill you
[53:58] and the law says that they should
[54:00] but where are these guys now
[54:02] can you imagine that
[54:04] every time we go on our knees brothers
[54:06] and sisters same same conversation
[54:07] happens can we see that conversation
[54:10] happening I I if I can I just want to
[54:12] try and encourage that one thought that
[54:14] every time we go on our knees that's
[54:16] what he's saying to us where's your
[54:17] accusers there's no accusers
[54:20] it's just you and me here now let's talk
[54:26] and she said no man
[54:28] Lord
[54:29] and Jesus said unto her neither do I
[54:32] condemn thee
[54:34] go and sin no more
[54:36] if we could just do that
[54:38] in our lives if we could just do that
[54:40] every time we go to our our knees and
[54:42] pray and remember that it's the devil
[54:44] that accuses it's not God that accuses
[54:47] there's times when we do things wrong in
[54:49] our lives but we just need to make it
[54:51] right that's all we need to do we need
[54:53] to have a humble heart and we need to
[54:55] just go and make it right not not drag
[54:57] it around and pretend that it's all good
[54:58] and it's okay I heard a brother saying
[55:01] this and it was so good if we have a
[55:04] situation in our lives between a husband
[55:06] and a wife if we go and and just pretend
[55:09] if we've offended our wife if we've hurt
[55:11] her with words that we said and and we
[55:14] just pretend that it's just not a
[55:17] problem because we've hurt her
[55:19] what good is it to say I'm sorry
[55:22] if we haven't truly repented to her
[55:25] how much more with our heavenly father
[55:27] who can see our hearts
[55:30] but to think about his his perception
[55:34] where's our accusers goodness talking
[55:37] about adultery I'm just going to start
[55:39] cruising now uh for time's sake in
[55:42] Exodus chapter 20 just to sort of lay a
[55:45] foundation a background now we were
[55:47] reading from the New Testament you don't
[55:49] have to turn there but out of Exodus
[55:51] chapter 20 verse 14 Thou shalt not
[55:53] commit adultery it's it's part of the
[55:55] Ten Commandments it's a very important
[55:57] part but remember there's ten parts to
[55:59] the Commandments it's not just one
[56:01] there's ten
[56:03] this one's the seventh and it's a very
[56:05] important one and it's interesting the
[56:08] way that God uses this in the Bible and
[56:11] and goes weaves in and out of spiritual
[56:14] adultery and natural adultery through
[56:16] the entire Bible and the prophet picks
[56:18] it up and talks about it very clearly
[56:20] that way as well
[56:22] in Leviticus chapter 20 verse 10 and the
[56:26] man that committeth adultery with
[56:28] another man's wife even he that
[56:29] committeth adultery with this neighbor's
[56:31] wife the adulterer and the adulteress
[56:33] shall be surely put to death talking
[56:36] about our scripture just setting a
[56:37] background for it they should be put to
[56:39] death
[56:42] those people were completely justified
[56:44] in their behavior before Jesus there
[56:47] that's the law
[56:51] Proverbs chapter 6. verse 32 but whoso
[56:54] committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
[56:56] understanding he that doeth it
[56:58] destroyeth his own soul
[57:00] a wound and dishonor shall he get and
[57:04] his reproach shall not be wiped away
[57:06] for jealousy is the Rage of a man
[57:08] therefore he will not spare in the day
[57:10] of Vengeance he will not regard any
[57:12] Ransom neither will he rest content
[57:14] though thou give us many gifts
[57:18] think about how we just read those
[57:21] scriptures and let's not talk about
[57:23] natural adultery let's talk about
[57:24] spiritual adultery that's really what I
[57:27] want to talk about tonight because when
[57:29] we get into spiritual adultery it is
[57:31] death to a person
[57:34] we can be the most religious people
[57:36] but if we mix something with this and
[57:39] say that it's our tradition we've done
[57:41] it this way it's just what we believe
[57:42] it's what we've been taught
[57:45] it's adultery brothers and sisters it's
[57:47] not going to work we can't take the
[57:49] message and mix anything with it he is
[57:52] espoused to one wife
[57:54] to one wife
[57:56] and you know really where this is going
[57:58] if we talk about spiritual fornication
[58:00] let's let's just break it right down
[58:03] here now for a second where is the truth
[58:05] for our day
[58:06] there's one one way one truth and one
[58:09] life
[58:10] that's the Lord Jesus Christ through his
[58:13] Vindicated Prophet the message of the
[58:15] hour that's the truth for our day so if
[58:18] we want to take the message of the hour
[58:20] and try and interpret it try and do it
[58:23] our own way brothers and sisters what
[58:26] we're doing is committing spiritual
[58:27] fornication we're committing adultery
[58:31] we don't want to do that
[58:34] but I mean we can talk about it for a
[58:36] second I hope
[58:40] I've heard it said that and I didn't
[58:42] realize it this way but it's interesting
[58:44] in the Old Testament there was a time
[58:47] where they began to set up Groves
[58:50] and high places
[58:52] and and have hireling preachers
[58:55] and the Groves and the high places were
[58:58] there places of worship at home
[59:01] for the idols that they created
[59:03] they no longer took their their
[59:04] sacrifice to the temple
[59:07] they no longer went and and operated
[59:09] according to the methods that we talked
[59:11] about in the temple and how sacred the
[59:13] the office of the temple was and and all
[59:15] of the things that needed to be executed
[59:17] in the temple
[59:18] people started to create Groves plant
[59:21] trees and create a private space where
[59:23] they could go and worship the way that
[59:25] they want to
[59:26] almost like the the days of the judges
[59:28] where the people just did what was right
[59:30] in their own sight
[59:33] but what happened when the people of God
[59:35] raised up when there was a king that
[59:37] raised up maybe the son of a king that
[59:39] raised up of the Old Testament and he
[59:41] walked after the ways of God and he
[59:44] didn't walk after the ways of his father
[59:45] what he would do one of the first things
[59:47] he would do is go and smash the Groves
[59:49] and cut down the high places maybe I
[59:51] said that backwards cut down the high
[59:53] places and smashed the Groves and get
[59:55] rid of all the idols get rid of all of
[59:58] the adultery that's going on in the land
[1:00:01] we don't want to have any of that in our
[1:00:02] lives brothers and sisters we talked
[1:00:04] about it a little bit adultery in our
[1:00:06] lives can be idolatry
[1:00:09] having something in our life that's just
[1:00:11] as equal as God is in our life
[1:00:14] there's nothing equal to God in our
[1:00:16] lives and if there is we need to be
[1:00:17] careful we need to check it
[1:00:19] yes
[1:00:22] but in Proverbs it says that he will not
[1:00:24] regard any Ransom neither will he rest
[1:00:25] content though he gives it give us many
[1:00:27] gifts to commit that that spiritual
[1:00:30] fornication adultery is is
[1:00:33] Unforgivable
[1:00:34] it's the one thing that God will not
[1:00:36] tolerate in in our lives
[1:00:40] in the Old Testament you know the
[1:00:41] prophets talked about it Jeremiah read
[1:00:43] the book of Jeremiah he talks about it
[1:00:45] whoredom
[1:00:46] and adultery spiritually speaking the
[1:00:49] way they worshiped Ezekiel Jose they
[1:00:52] they all cried out against it
[1:00:54] they were speaking they were the Lord's
[1:00:57] mouthpiece for their age crying out for
[1:00:58] it and you know what's no different for
[1:01:00] brother Branham when you hear him talk
[1:01:01] about this he cried out about it
[1:01:05] Israel and Judah both getting mixed up
[1:01:07] with other gods beginning to mix their
[1:01:09] own ideas with the truth for their day
[1:01:13] God didn't call it heirs or sin he
[1:01:15] called it adultery
[1:01:17] that's a heavy statement
[1:01:20] and you know the word
[1:01:23] it's having an intimate relationship
[1:01:24] with someone other than your spouse when
[1:01:26] you're married to someone you make a
[1:01:27] commitment to them when you get saved
[1:01:30] and you make a commitment to God we make
[1:01:32] a commitment to God and we give our
[1:01:34] lives to God and and we're espoused to
[1:01:36] him but then there comes a time where
[1:01:39] potentially we mix something else in
[1:01:40] there with it we take it and mix it in
[1:01:43] maybe it's a little bit of psychology
[1:01:44] maybe somebody gave us something that
[1:01:46] sounded really good at a time and we mix
[1:01:47] it in I say Lord help us because it
[1:01:50] floats around it's all over the place we
[1:01:52] need to make sure that what we believe
[1:01:54] checks with the word and that's why we
[1:01:55] were talking about church order not
[1:01:58] because we need to do things differently
[1:01:59] here because we need to understand why
[1:02:01] we do things the way we do
[1:02:03] and to be careful to be vigilant to not
[1:02:06] let anything else creep in
[1:02:09] we can we can have things creep in very
[1:02:12] easily the Devil comes to church
[1:02:16] but we don't want to commit adultery
[1:02:18] spiritual adultery
[1:02:21] in second Corinthians 11.
[1:02:24] verse 2 for I am jealous over you with
[1:02:28] The Godly jealousy
[1:02:30] for I have espoused you to one husband
[1:02:35] if you just this is just so amazing
[1:02:38] that I may present you as a chaste
[1:02:41] virgin to Christ
[1:02:42] end of a new year
[1:02:44] but I fear less by any means
[1:02:47] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:02:50] subtlety
[1:02:51] so your minds should be corrupted from
[1:02:54] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:02:58] we don't want to try and make
[1:03:00] Christ the doctrine of Jesus Christ
[1:03:03] anything more than what it is it's not
[1:03:06] complicated
[1:03:08] it's come according to the word for our
[1:03:10] day
[1:03:11] and watch him bless us mightily
[1:03:16] in the message why Christ speak
[1:03:18] and the church is organized and all them
[1:03:21] gathered together as harlots to the
[1:03:23] and everything exactly in the way
[1:03:25] of whoredom whoredom what is that
[1:03:29] telling women they can cut their hair
[1:03:30] telling women they can wear shorts
[1:03:32] telling men they can do this they can do
[1:03:35] that
[1:03:36] and this is where it gets right personal
[1:03:38] for me
[1:03:40] but I'm reading it he says and a
[1:03:42] preacher saying do this
[1:03:44] and the social gospel and things don't
[1:03:48] you see it's committing adultery with
[1:03:50] the true word of God
[1:03:52] and God has sent us his true word
[1:03:54] undenominational no strings tied to it
[1:03:57] and give us a pillar of fire and the
[1:04:00] Holy Ghost that's been with us now for
[1:04:02] he says 30 years but I would think it's
[1:04:05] probably like
[1:04:06] 60 years
[1:04:08] somewhere in there
[1:04:09] and everything that he's predicted and
[1:04:12] said come to pass exactly the way he
[1:04:15] said it
[1:04:16] talking about our day brothers and
[1:04:17] sisters we don't want to mix anything
[1:04:19] with the word
[1:04:22] in Matthew chapter 5. ye have heard that
[1:04:25] it was set by them of old time Thou
[1:04:27] shalt not commit adultery but I say unto
[1:04:30] you
[1:04:31] that whomsoever looketh on a woman to
[1:04:34] lust after her hath committed adultery
[1:04:36] with her already in his heart
[1:04:40] now this brothers and sisters might be a
[1:04:43] place where we sort of
[1:04:44] pause and and just talk about this for a
[1:04:47] little bit
[1:04:48] because when has there ever been a time
[1:04:51] with so much visualization in this world
[1:04:55] we don't know what there was in the days
[1:04:57] of Noah and brother Branham said that
[1:04:59] there was technology that was beyond
[1:05:01] ours they could build the pyramids and
[1:05:03] so on
[1:05:06] but talking about this scripture here
[1:05:09] you know brother Branham he really
[1:05:11] spells it out really brings it out so
[1:05:13] good
[1:05:14] it's not good but he makes it clear
[1:05:17] which is a good thing is what I mean
[1:05:19] that's what I'm trying to express it's
[1:05:21] good that we have such Clarity for it
[1:05:23] and and in that a man that looks on a
[1:05:26] woman
[1:05:27] to lust after her
[1:05:29] in his heart
[1:05:31] has already committed adultery just
[1:05:33] because he's looked on her
[1:05:35] but brother Branham says why does the
[1:05:37] man look on her
[1:05:39] because she presents herself that way
[1:05:42] and you know the woman that presents
[1:05:44] herself that way brother Branham says
[1:05:46] this that she has a lust Spirit upon her
[1:05:50] and she doesn't even know it
[1:05:54] and to think about all of the stuff that
[1:05:57] we see in this world
[1:05:59] it's impossible for us to not see things
[1:06:03] men and women
[1:06:06] but I'm going to pause and speak to the
[1:06:07] men for a little while here
[1:06:11] I say unto you that whosoever looketh
[1:06:14] upon a woman to lust after her hath
[1:06:16] committed adultery with her already in
[1:06:19] his heart
[1:06:22] when has there ever been an age like
[1:06:24] this one brothers and sisters
[1:06:27] and we're going to drill down a little
[1:06:29] bit and I pray that we don't get
[1:06:31] uncomfortable
[1:06:32] and I I I I beg further conversation
[1:06:36] about this
[1:06:38] the internet
[1:06:40] it can be a dangerous place in light of
[1:06:43] this scripture
[1:06:45] I don't know how many people have
[1:06:47] experienced it
[1:06:49] but you can make one wrong click on the
[1:06:52] internet
[1:06:53] and you see things that you don't want
[1:06:55] to see
[1:06:57] and we're gonna we're gonna drill down a
[1:06:59] little bit here
[1:07:00] if we spend a little time
[1:07:04] the internet can be a very dangerous
[1:07:06] place
[1:07:08] and you know as I was I was meditating
[1:07:10] on this today
[1:07:12] if we talk about a pandemic
[1:07:15] and what is a pandemic brothers and
[1:07:18] sisters
[1:07:19] and we have a real clear top of Mind
[1:07:22] understanding and description of a
[1:07:24] pandemic we're in the midst of one and
[1:07:26] every single person here is a
[1:07:28] representation of it because there's so
[1:07:30] few people and the EP only people that
[1:07:32] are here are wearing a mask because of
[1:07:34] that word pandemic
[1:07:36] it's caused an action to take place in
[1:07:39] this world the entire world
[1:07:42] because of a pandemic
[1:07:44] a pandemic
[1:07:46] the definition of a disease
[1:07:49] prevalent over a whole country or the
[1:07:51] world
[1:07:53] brothers and sisters if there is a
[1:07:55] pandemic for covid then what is there
[1:07:57] for pornography
[1:08:00] and you know what I'm going to call that
[1:08:02] Spirit out tonight in the name of the
[1:08:04] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] because I know that Spirit has made
[1:08:08] itself a home in people's lives right
[1:08:11] here in Calgary
[1:08:14] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:08:15] if I said that I haven't been affected
[1:08:17] by it in my lifetime I would be a liar
[1:08:20] and I'm not going to be a liar and I'm
[1:08:22] not going to be a hypocrite I am going
[1:08:24] to say that there is a delivering power
[1:08:26] in the name of Jesus Christ and we don't
[1:08:28] have to tolerate the spirit of
[1:08:30] pornography in our lives
[1:08:34] and brothers and sisters if I have one
[1:08:36] message to give out tonight
[1:08:38] if there's someone that has a problem
[1:08:40] with it
[1:08:42] what does the word say
[1:08:44] it doesn't say go and isolate yourself
[1:08:46] and pretend that you're the only person
[1:08:49] that has a problem it says confess your
[1:08:52] faults one to another
[1:08:54] reach out for help
[1:08:56] don't hide
[1:08:58] let's draw closer together
[1:09:01] brothers and sisters
[1:09:03] I'm not going to say that I have a
[1:09:05] problem with it now but I can tell you
[1:09:08] that the time in my life I did have a
[1:09:10] problem with it
[1:09:11] and I'm not I'm not boasting
[1:09:14] that I had a problem I'm boasting that
[1:09:17] there is a delivering power in the name
[1:09:18] of Jesus Christ
[1:09:21] we don't have to tolerate it
[1:09:24] and you know brothers and sisters from
[1:09:26] what I've seen in my life just my own
[1:09:29] experience that's the only thing I can
[1:09:30] talk about and say with with with a real
[1:09:32] conviction in my heart is that when you
[1:09:35] experience something you just know that
[1:09:37] it happens you know that there is a way
[1:09:40] out once you've experienced it but when
[1:09:42] you're in the midst of it you can feel
[1:09:44] like you're drowning you can feel like
[1:09:46] there's no Escape you feel like if you
[1:09:48] talk to anyone about it you'll be
[1:09:50] shunned you'll be kicked out of the
[1:09:51] church you won't be loved your family
[1:09:53] won't love you your spouse will divorce
[1:09:55] you
[1:09:57] speaking about this very specific thing
[1:09:59] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[1:10:01] give it any power
[1:10:02] we can destroy it brother Branham says
[1:10:05] that an exposed Devil is a defeated
[1:10:07] devil
[1:10:09] if you've got trouble
[1:10:11] if it's afflicting you
[1:10:12] Reach Out
[1:10:14] seek help
[1:10:16] don't try and live it on your own
[1:10:18] don't don't don't just pretend that it's
[1:10:20] just gonna go away one day because it
[1:10:22] won't
[1:10:23] we need each other
[1:10:26] brothers and sisters we're dealing with
[1:10:28] a pandemic and you know it's one thing
[1:10:30] to see all of the treatment that's out
[1:10:32] there for this this pandemic of covet
[1:10:35] that that kills some people and some
[1:10:37] people don't even know they have it it's
[1:10:39] just up and down and all around
[1:10:42] but what's going on for this this one
[1:10:44] topic of pornography
[1:10:47] when I was growing up in the Pentecostal
[1:10:49] church it was a it was it was a really
[1:10:50] quiet discussion nobody wanted to talk
[1:10:52] about it and I'm not I'm not going to
[1:10:54] start going off parents relax I'm not
[1:10:56] going to go off in in a strange
[1:10:58] direction we're in a mixed audience it's
[1:11:00] as far as I'm going to go that way but
[1:11:03] what I am saying is it's not something
[1:11:04] that we want to shy away from parents we
[1:11:07] have got to educate our children we have
[1:11:10] got to make sure they're hearing about
[1:11:12] this topic from us because they're going
[1:11:14] to hear about it somewhere
[1:11:21] what this does
[1:11:23] in the life of a human being
[1:11:25] is is you can look the research up if
[1:11:27] you're into it I'm not recommending that
[1:11:30] you just go and do a bunch of research
[1:11:32] on it if you're not affected by it then
[1:11:34] God bless you it's wonderful if you are
[1:11:36] affected then God bless you there's
[1:11:37] treatment you can be helped and you can
[1:11:40] be helped in and around the message
[1:11:41] there is a way to be helped but what it
[1:11:44] does is it causes a cycle of iniquity in
[1:11:47] people's hearts even the unbelievers
[1:11:49] they don't even realize that what they
[1:11:50] do is they they start to Hunger for More
[1:11:52] and what they do to feed that hunger is
[1:11:54] they just go and and do whatever they do
[1:11:56] and brothers and sisters when we get
[1:11:58] into this cycle it just cripples our
[1:12:01] spiritual walk
[1:12:02] it cripples us we're on a cycle like a
[1:12:06] hamster wheel like we'll never be able
[1:12:08] to get off
[1:12:10] one day we're up praise the Lord I'm
[1:12:12] saved and I feel it and it's all good
[1:12:14] and then next day comes around and
[1:12:16] something happens and before long you're
[1:12:18] feeling like you just failed and God
[1:12:21] doesn't want to hear your prayer because
[1:12:22] you failed and and you feel like you've
[1:12:24] just committed spiritual adultery and
[1:12:27] you know there's a way out there's a way
[1:12:29] to be helped we don't have to tolerate
[1:12:32] that we don't have to tolerate sickness
[1:12:34] we don't have to tolerate mental
[1:12:37] problems
[1:12:38] we don't have to tolerate this cycle of
[1:12:40] iniquity in people's hearts
[1:12:42] what we need to do is get behind the
[1:12:44] Waters of separation and let the word
[1:12:47] wash Us by the washing of the water of
[1:12:50] the word
[1:12:55] just thinking about all the time and the
[1:12:57] resources poured into treating covet
[1:12:59] though
[1:13:00] and and there's there's a greater
[1:13:02] pandemic going on in this world and it's
[1:13:04] causing people to just become crazy
[1:13:07] they don't even know it
[1:13:09] they're completely veiled by a lust bail
[1:13:12] and you know brother Branham talks about
[1:13:13] it in the Garden of Eden how Adam and
[1:13:16] Eve they were veiled
[1:13:18] by a spiritual Veil
[1:13:20] by a Godly Veil and that's how they
[1:13:22] didn't know they were naked
[1:13:24] but once the curse happened
[1:13:26] that's when that veil was taken off and
[1:13:29] that's when they became ashamed and
[1:13:30] that's when they clothed themselves with
[1:13:32] what
[1:13:33] brother Branham says religion
[1:13:35] the world says fig leaves
[1:13:37] brother Branham says religion isn't that
[1:13:39] amazing so right back there it turns
[1:13:42] into spiritual adultery right there
[1:13:45] even though it was a natural
[1:13:47] typing the spiritual
[1:13:50] we don't have to tolerate it brothers
[1:13:52] and sisters
[1:13:55] Satan tries to divide and conquer
[1:13:59] and he's taught man to do that
[1:14:02] we don't have to do that brothers and
[1:14:03] sisters
[1:14:05] it's what happens
[1:14:06] how many was here when brother Dale
[1:14:08] Smith preached a snake bit and dog
[1:14:12] it was in the upper room I know not many
[1:14:14] were here for the Dale Smith a good
[1:14:16] brother he was here not long ago
[1:14:18] actually but he preached a sermon about
[1:14:20] a snake bitten dog
[1:14:22] and really what it was was how someone
[1:14:24] could actually get a dog can they can
[1:14:27] have a dog that's their best friend
[1:14:28] man's best friend just loves them comes
[1:14:30] every single time he calls them best of
[1:14:33] friends but he goes and he gets bitten
[1:14:34] by a snake
[1:14:36] and he starts to get poisoned by that
[1:14:38] snake that venom goes through the dog
[1:14:40] and he starts to foam at the mouth and
[1:14:42] he was relating that to a person that
[1:14:44] has something that happens to them in
[1:14:46] their lives and he wasn't calling
[1:14:47] brothers and sisters dogs but what he is
[1:14:50] relating it to was how the reactive
[1:14:52] behavior is when that poison starts to
[1:14:54] flow through a a person to someone who
[1:14:57] is actually spiritually endowed it stops
[1:15:00] the power of God and what they do is
[1:15:02] they they start to pull away and a dog
[1:15:05] that's been snake bitten won't come to
[1:15:06] you he doesn't want to come to you one
[1:15:08] minute he's your best friend the next
[1:15:09] minute he snake bit and he's poisoned
[1:15:11] and he doesn't want to come around
[1:15:14] that's what the devil does he gets us to
[1:15:16] a place where we just maybe stop coming
[1:15:18] to church as much
[1:15:20] maybe we stop fellowshipping with our
[1:15:22] brothers and our sisters as much maybe
[1:15:24] our relationship starts to just become a
[1:15:27] little bit cool in our marriage maybe
[1:15:29] maybe
[1:15:31] um whatever it is we just start to have
[1:15:33] a difference in behavior and we don't
[1:15:35] have to have that
[1:15:37] the word in James 5 says confess your
[1:15:39] faults one to another and pray for one
[1:15:41] another
[1:15:42] how can we properly pray for one another
[1:15:44] if we don't confess our faults I can say
[1:15:46] God bless brother Toby help him in his
[1:15:49] ways but if I don't know what he's
[1:15:50] struggling with how can I actually draw
[1:15:52] my sword and put it to the throat of the
[1:15:54] devil that's attacking my brother
[1:15:57] confess your faults one to another and
[1:16:00] pray for one another
[1:16:02] that ye may be healed
[1:16:05] that ye may be healed
[1:16:08] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:16:10] righteous man a veileth much
[1:16:13] think about that brothers and sisters
[1:16:16] if we know what's going on in each
[1:16:17] other's lives we're not afraid to talk
[1:16:19] to one another and say I've got this
[1:16:22] thing and and I just don't feel like I
[1:16:25] know what to do with it will you just go
[1:16:27] on your knees with me and pray
[1:16:29] and not suffer in silence imagine the
[1:16:32] power of that brother to brother sister
[1:16:35] to sister and then to be able to have
[1:16:37] the honest conversation brother how are
[1:16:39] you doing and to be able to answer back
[1:16:42] honestly
[1:16:43] we're humans
[1:16:45] we're dealing with devils
[1:16:47] and they think they're going to win
[1:16:49] brothers and sisters they are not going
[1:16:51] to give up
[1:16:53] think about the animals how smart they
[1:16:55] are what do they do when they're being
[1:16:56] attacked
[1:16:58] they Tighten Up In The Herd
[1:17:00] they draw closer together and they put
[1:17:03] the weakest ones in the middle
[1:17:06] do we do that as Sons and Daughters of
[1:17:08] God
[1:17:09] or do we just say you know hey I'm saved
[1:17:12] I'm I'm a Son of God and
[1:17:14] they're a Son of God and we've got Sons
[1:17:16] and Daughters of God and we're super
[1:17:17] strong we're super strength and we are
[1:17:21] but are we applying the word the way it
[1:17:23] says to apply it
[1:17:25] we can't live our lives and think that
[1:17:26] we're going to get an Apostolic blessing
[1:17:28] in an Apostolic age if we don't apply
[1:17:29] the word the way the apostolic blessing
[1:17:32] comes
[1:17:34] just talking about adultery here in a
[1:17:36] visible Union of the Bride how can we
[1:17:38] strain at the natural because it's so
[1:17:41] tangible
[1:17:43] right
[1:17:45] the Holy Ghost is using this
[1:17:46] illustration to show the church
[1:17:48] something
[1:17:49] she has this sacred Womanhood no wonder
[1:17:51] that men act around women the way they
[1:17:53] do it's because women act around men the
[1:17:56] way they do
[1:17:57] she characters herself out here with a
[1:17:59] pair of shorts on and skin tight and
[1:18:01] men's clothing and things out on the
[1:18:03] street twisting around now I'm not
[1:18:04] talking about our sisters here just for
[1:18:06] the record I just feel that I'm not
[1:18:08] talking about our sisters here I'm just
[1:18:09] quoting what the prophet said about the
[1:18:11] world around us
[1:18:13] no matter what she says she might be as
[1:18:15] virtuous to her husband as she can be
[1:18:17] but in the sight of God she is
[1:18:19] adulterous
[1:18:22] whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust
[1:18:24] after her has committed adultery with
[1:18:26] her already in his heart and she
[1:18:28] presented herself to be that and that's
[1:18:30] exactly what the church has done with
[1:18:33] the world
[1:18:34] that's what we're talking about here the
[1:18:36] the natural and and and the spiritual
[1:18:39] how can a preacher go out here to a
[1:18:41] seminary and look at Acts 2 38 and it
[1:18:44] sees there's not a person in the Bible
[1:18:46] ever baptized in those titles and then
[1:18:49] still say he's pregnant with the word of
[1:18:51] God
[1:18:53] what does the prophet say here
[1:18:54] he's telling you a lie
[1:18:59] he sold his birthrights
[1:19:01] he's committed adultery against the very
[1:19:03] thing that he said he's put away in
[1:19:05] divorce
[1:19:07] I heard something astounding this week
[1:19:10] trinitarianism
[1:19:14] I didn't realize it was so important I
[1:19:17] mean I know it's important if you don't
[1:19:18] actually come according to the word
[1:19:20] you're you're not going to receive the
[1:19:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[1:19:24] you might get a a spiritual anointing
[1:19:27] you might get a physical anointing you
[1:19:29] might get both of those but you might
[1:19:31] not get it on your soul that token might
[1:19:32] not be where it's supposed to be but
[1:19:34] trinitarianism you can look up that word
[1:19:36] in the message brother Branham talks
[1:19:37] about it in Revelations chapter 4 part
[1:19:40] 3. he says now my precious brother I
[1:19:43] know this is a tape also now don't get
[1:19:45] excited let me say this with Godly love
[1:19:48] the hour has approached where I can't
[1:19:50] hold still on these things no more
[1:19:52] too close to the coming see
[1:19:55] trinitarianism is of the devil
[1:20:00] and he says I say that thus saith the
[1:20:03] Lord
[1:20:05] I didn't realize that it was that
[1:20:07] prominent
[1:20:10] look where it come from it come from the
[1:20:12] Nicene Council when the Catholic Church
[1:20:13] became in rulership the word Trinity is
[1:20:15] not ever mentioned in the entire book of
[1:20:17] the Bible and as far as three Gods
[1:20:19] that's from hell
[1:20:21] there's one God
[1:20:22] that's exactly right
[1:20:25] remember that one God
[1:20:27] he's a jealous God
[1:20:31] like I said earlier I believe that there
[1:20:34] is a lot of avenues that we're going to
[1:20:36] explore with this
[1:20:38] I just wanted to hit on this one thing
[1:20:40] tonight
[1:20:41] and and sort of set a stage
[1:20:44] and we'll just see where things go
[1:20:47] we're not done yet just for the record I
[1:20:49] should say I'm I'm I'm closing
[1:20:53] we have 15 minutes
[1:20:55] he says there's one God that's exactly
[1:20:57] right in Ephesians chapter five now
[1:21:00] we're going to go back to the Natural
[1:21:01] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:21:03] the fear of God
[1:21:05] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:21:08] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[1:21:10] husband is the head of the wife even as
[1:21:12] Christ is the head of the church
[1:21:15] and he is the savior of the body
[1:21:18] the husband is the savior of the family
[1:21:21] the husband is the savior of the home
[1:21:24] it's not a pastor's job to be the savior
[1:21:26] of a home
[1:21:27] it's not a pastor's job to be the savior
[1:21:29] of the family it's not the prophet's job
[1:21:31] to do that that's the father's job
[1:21:35] the father is the head of the home
[1:21:38] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:21:40] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:21:42] and he is the savior of the body
[1:21:43] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:21:47] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:21:50] husbands in everything
[1:21:54] now just for the record
[1:21:58] this isn't talking about making your
[1:21:59] wife a doormat
[1:22:02] this isn't talking about a wife being a
[1:22:04] Slave
[1:22:06] this is talking just just I'll put it in
[1:22:08] in in in in Barry's lingo this is
[1:22:11] talking about a husband being in his
[1:22:14] spiritual position
[1:22:16] and when he's in his spiritual
[1:22:17] possession then the wife is going to
[1:22:20] have a submission to her husband who is
[1:22:23] in her his spiritual position it's going
[1:22:26] to cause everyone to fall in their place
[1:22:29] and if there's a problem in the home
[1:22:31] it's not what the child necessarily and
[1:22:34] it's not with the wife necessarily
[1:22:37] husbands take a look at yourselves
[1:22:40] we need to research our own lives and
[1:22:43] say am I right with the Lord do I have
[1:22:45] iniquity in my life
[1:22:48] again I can preach this because I've
[1:22:50] experienced it get your life right and
[1:22:53] watch everything change in your life
[1:22:55] get your life out of order I don't know
[1:22:57] if anyone else has experienced this
[1:22:58] husbands if you get your life out of
[1:23:00] order however you do I'm not pointing at
[1:23:02] anything in particular but get outside
[1:23:04] of the word for just a little bit and
[1:23:06] watch I've seen in my house my house
[1:23:07] goes upside down the kids start going
[1:23:09] crazy the wife gets upset before I know
[1:23:12] it I want to leave the house because I'm
[1:23:14] thinking what's going on what's the big
[1:23:15] problem and then I get out the door
[1:23:17] thinking man those people are crazy and
[1:23:19] the Lord says to me
[1:23:20] but what did you do
[1:23:22] why is it that way
[1:23:24] let's have a talk
[1:23:26] come son let's let's have a conversation
[1:23:28] the grace of our loving father to give
[1:23:31] us the opportunity to see that in our
[1:23:33] lives to have him speak to us and show
[1:23:36] us that not through me I'm just saying
[1:23:38] myself and my own experience here
[1:23:40] what a tremendous blessing it is
[1:23:42] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:23:44] also loved the church and gave it
[1:23:47] gave himself for it that he might
[1:23:49] sanctify it I love this that he might
[1:23:52] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:23:55] of the Water by the word that he might
[1:23:58] present it to himself a glorious church
[1:24:01] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:24:03] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:24:06] without blemish
[1:24:08] if we can get ourselves into this order
[1:24:10] brothers and sisters just get rid of all
[1:24:13] the iniquity in our lives not have any
[1:24:15] stumbling blocks and if we do just call
[1:24:17] someone confess your faults one to
[1:24:19] another and pray for one another
[1:24:22] so that you may be healed
[1:24:25] there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:24:29] he says so ought men to love their wives
[1:24:31] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[1:24:33] wife loveth himself for no man ever yet
[1:24:36] hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
[1:24:38] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[1:24:41] church for we are members of his body of
[1:24:43] his flesh and of his bones
[1:24:46] that day on Calvary that's when the
[1:24:49] bride the feminine part was taken out of
[1:24:51] him
[1:24:53] that's when the rib came out of Jesus
[1:24:55] Christ came out of the Lord God Almighty
[1:24:58] that's why how on Earth if that wasn't
[1:25:00] God that died on Calvary
[1:25:03] how could we even be the bride
[1:25:08] we'd be espoused to Jesus as a third
[1:25:10] person some other guy
[1:25:12] it's total adultery
[1:25:17] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:25:19] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:25:20] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[1:25:23] flesh
[1:25:26] this is a great mystery he says
[1:25:30] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[1:25:32] church
[1:25:33] he's using a natural example right out
[1:25:36] of Genesis that we read
[1:25:39] but he's using it as an example for the
[1:25:42] church
[1:25:45] this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:25:47] concerning Christ in the church
[1:25:48] nevertheless that every one of you in
[1:25:51] particular so love his wife
[1:25:54] even as himself
[1:25:55] and the wife see that she reverends her
[1:25:58] husband
[1:26:01] James 5.
[1:26:04] is any money any among you afflicted
[1:26:07] is anybody afflicted
[1:26:09] let him pray
[1:26:11] is any Mary let him sing songs Psalms is
[1:26:14] any sick among you let him call for the
[1:26:16] Elders of the church and let them pray
[1:26:18] over him anointing him with oil in the
[1:26:20] name of the Lord
[1:26:22] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:26:24] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[1:26:27] if we have committed sins
[1:26:28] they shall be forgiven him
[1:26:33] they'll be forgiven
[1:26:36] not even because we did anything just
[1:26:38] because we came according to the word we
[1:26:40] came and were Anointed with oil and and
[1:26:42] just brought it before the church to be
[1:26:44] the Elders of the church to just have
[1:26:47] the blessing of God in our lives he goes
[1:26:49] on to say confess your faults one to
[1:26:51] another and pray for one another that ye
[1:26:53] may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:26:54] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:26:56] Elias was a man subject to like passions
[1:26:59] as we are and he prayed earnestly that
[1:27:01] it might not rain and it rained not on
[1:27:03] the earth for a space of three years and
[1:27:05] six months he prayed again and the
[1:27:07] heaven gave rain and the Earth brought
[1:27:08] forth her fruit I'm going to pause there
[1:27:10] for a second brothers and sisters the
[1:27:11] Lord show me something with this this
[1:27:13] afternoon and that is I always wondered
[1:27:15] about this scripture because Elias he's
[1:27:18] he's the prophet right Elijah he's got
[1:27:21] the the prophetic gift he's in an office
[1:27:23] he's got the power to pray what he's
[1:27:25] saying here he's a man of like passion
[1:27:27] and if he can pray that prayer and see a
[1:27:30] result for his prayer so can you we can
[1:27:33] pray and see results for our prayers
[1:27:35] that's what that scripture saying to us
[1:27:37] it's not putting it off onto someone
[1:27:39] else it's taking it and putting it into
[1:27:41] our own laps and it's up to us to do
[1:27:43] what we want with it
[1:27:46] and he prayed again and the heaven gave
[1:27:48] up rain and the Earth brought forth her
[1:27:50] fruit Brethren if any of you do air from
[1:27:53] the truth and one convert him
[1:27:55] if someone's hurting inside if someone
[1:27:57] is dying inside and he has the strength
[1:28:00] to reach out and help and you have the
[1:28:02] ability to say to him brother it's okay
[1:28:04] let's pray together let's see the spirit
[1:28:06] of God come back upon you let's get rid
[1:28:09] of this devil that's cast him out in the
[1:28:11] name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:13] Brethren if any of you do air from the
[1:28:15] truth and one convert him let him know
[1:28:17] that he which converteth The Sinner from
[1:28:19] the air of his way shall save a soul
[1:28:21] from death and shall hide a multitude of
[1:28:24] sin
[1:28:25] we have the ability to do that brothers
[1:28:27] and sisters
[1:28:29] for each other
[1:28:32] for our families
[1:28:34] for people that we don't even know
[1:28:37] we live in a world where this world is
[1:28:39] hurting
[1:28:41] and the world is taught to be strong
[1:28:44] and just
[1:28:45] take it on the chin
[1:28:47] be a man
[1:28:48] be a woman be independent
[1:28:51] but that's not what the word says
[1:28:53] remember
[1:28:55] my strength is made perfect
[1:28:58] where
[1:29:01] we don't need to be strong brothers and
[1:29:03] sisters
[1:29:05] we need to be right with God
[1:29:07] and if we're right with God then Satan
[1:29:10] won't even know what to do with us and
[1:29:12] we've even read it that Satan he won't
[1:29:14] even be able to find us because we'll be
[1:29:16] so far back in the word
[1:29:18] will be gone
[1:29:22] let him know that he which converteth
[1:29:24] The Sinner from the air of his way shall
[1:29:26] save a soul from death and shall hide a
[1:29:28] multitude of sins
[1:29:30] remember when Jesus lifted himself up
[1:29:33] and he saw none but the woman he said
[1:29:35] unto her woman
[1:29:37] where are thine accusers
[1:29:39] and I want to say that tonight brothers
[1:29:41] and sisters after knowing the message of
[1:29:42] the hour after knowing that we don't
[1:29:44] have to tolerate devils in our lives we
[1:29:47] don't have to tolerate sin all of the
[1:29:49] afflictions that come around our ways we
[1:29:51] know that that all the thoughts that
[1:29:53] come to us they're not our thoughts
[1:29:54] they're God's thoughts and they're
[1:29:56] Satan's thoughts and they're God's
[1:29:58] thoughts and their Satan's thoughts and
[1:30:00] the word of God says to take every
[1:30:01] single thought into captivity and run it
[1:30:03] through the filter of the word and if it
[1:30:05] jives with the word then let it in and
[1:30:08] accept it but if it doesn't then dismiss
[1:30:10] it get rid of it
[1:30:11] it's like having the double barrel
[1:30:13] shotgun the old and the New Testament
[1:30:15] and when those birds fly over they're
[1:30:16] going to try and Roost in the tree and
[1:30:18] we have the opportunity to just let them
[1:30:20] start bringing sticks and building a
[1:30:22] nest and get a nest that's so big we've
[1:30:24] got to cut half the tree off to get rid
[1:30:26] of the nest or when we see that bird
[1:30:28] there we can just squeeze the trigger
[1:30:30] and get rid of them
[1:30:34] woman
[1:30:36] where are those thine accusers
[1:30:38] hath no man condemned thee
[1:30:42] can we look around in our lives and say
[1:30:44] no man Lord
[1:30:46] no devil lord
[1:30:49] no devil lord
[1:30:52] and hear him say to us neither
[1:30:55] do I condemn thee
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:01] go and sin no more brothers and sisters
[1:31:04] I
[1:31:05] maybe stand with me tonight
[1:31:08] as we truly do close
[1:31:11] remember
[1:31:13] the prophet for our day
[1:31:18] before this quote
[1:31:19] he said
[1:31:21] it's as though you never did it in the
[1:31:24] first place
[1:31:26] out of invisible Union of the Bride
[1:31:29] the call of the Holy Spirit searching
[1:31:31] the hearts
[1:31:33] you're standing completely
[1:31:36] now he's not saying it's not like you
[1:31:39] never did it
[1:31:41] the call of the Holy Spirit searching
[1:31:42] the hearts you're standing completely
[1:31:47] you never sinned in the first place
[1:31:51] God don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:31:54] forgetfulness
[1:31:56] you never did it
[1:32:00] woman where are those thine accusers
[1:32:06] does anyone accuse you
[1:32:09] when we go and stand before the Lord
[1:32:12] Jesus Christ and we apply the word
[1:32:15] imagine what it's like brothers and
[1:32:17] sisters to live with no condemnation in
[1:32:19] our lives
[1:32:20] that when we pray it's not us praying
[1:32:23] it's God actually speaking through us
[1:32:25] that's what we're talking about that's
[1:32:27] where it's omnipotence that's where it's
[1:32:30] divine favor when we speak he speaks
[1:32:34] adoption brothers and sisters the
[1:32:36] message of the hour Christ and flesh the
[1:32:38] invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:40] Christ the unveiling of God the Mighty
[1:32:42] God unveiled all of that living out
[1:32:45] through us it is the rising of the sun
[1:32:46] it's that quickening power in our lives
[1:32:49] the anointing knowing that there's no
[1:32:51] condemnation there is therefore now no
[1:32:53] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:32:57] Jesus who walk not after this flesh
[1:33:01] but live in the spirit
[1:33:04] the call of the Holy Spirit searching
[1:33:06] the hearts you're standing completely
[1:33:07] you never sinned in the first place
[1:33:10] you're a son and daughter of God
[1:33:13] don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:33:14] forgetfulness you never did it
[1:33:18] you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:33:20] but really from the beginning you were
[1:33:23] predestinated to be a son or daughter of
[1:33:25] God the prophet for our day telling us
[1:33:28] this brothers and sisters you're
[1:33:30] standing there washed in your old book
[1:33:32] of divorcement it's put away and is dead
[1:33:35] absolutely out of the existence even in
[1:33:38] the mind of God
[1:33:42] think about that how we go and pray oh
[1:33:46] my sounding brass and tinkling symbol
[1:33:49] prayers Lord help me help me help me
[1:33:52] help me help me help me what about just
[1:33:54] saying this is what the prophet said and
[1:33:56] I just believe it so that's got to
[1:33:57] settle it that's God speaking through
[1:33:59] the prophet to his children if you could
[1:34:01] just if we could just have ears to hear
[1:34:03] what the spirit's saying to the church
[1:34:05] think about the power that's there for
[1:34:07] us
[1:34:08] to overcome
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:12] you are The Virtuous bride of Christ
[1:34:16] spouse
[1:34:18] to one husband
[1:34:19] you are The Virtuous bride of Christ
[1:34:21] washed in the blood of Christ precious
[1:34:24] virtuous sinless Son of God standing
[1:34:27] with the pure unadulterated bride word
[1:34:30] that he Washed by the Water of his own
[1:34:34] blood
[1:34:35] that became flesh and manifested all
[1:34:39] right I just I could just read this
[1:34:41] whole quote on I could just keep going
[1:34:43] on and on and on with it he might take
[1:34:46] you
[1:34:47] which were predestinated in the bosom of
[1:34:50] the father before the beginning
[1:34:53] a sinless son of God
[1:34:56] a sinless daughter of God no matter what
[1:34:59] we've done on this Earth
[1:35:03] what we deal with in terms of
[1:35:05] accusations in our lives brothers and
[1:35:07] sisters for those people who might be
[1:35:09] tuned in or might have something here
[1:35:13] all of these things that the accuser
[1:35:15] brings Before the Throne they're all
[1:35:17] attributes of something
[1:35:20] and it's this old nature
[1:35:22] but when we've been converted
[1:35:25] what is your desire
[1:35:28] do you still desire to do that stuff do
[1:35:30] you still desire to go that way you
[1:35:33] don't
[1:35:34] so when the Devil comes around and tells
[1:35:36] you because you have these attributes
[1:35:38] these things that are being accused
[1:35:40] Before the Throne
[1:35:42] they're all lies
[1:35:44] because you believe
[1:35:46] we just haven't had the ability to maybe
[1:35:49] go all the way
[1:35:52] we don't want to let the devil lie to us
[1:35:55] I know in my life I let the devil lie to
[1:35:57] me way too many times for way too long
[1:36:00] but what we need to do is just simply
[1:36:02] speak the word to the devil
[1:36:04] just like Jesus defeated the devil we
[1:36:06] need to do it if we can recognize that
[1:36:09] Antichrist Spirit brothers and sisters
[1:36:10] creeping into our lives
[1:36:13] Satan will be powerless before us
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:18] he's not only coming for a pure
[1:36:20] unadulterated bride
[1:36:23] what the prophet is saying in this quote
[1:36:25] here is that you are the pure
[1:36:27] unadulterated bride you never did it in
[1:36:30] the first place if you have the ability
[1:36:32] to hear the message of the hour to
[1:36:34] recognize your position in Christ Satan
[1:36:36] has no power over you no matter how
[1:36:38] Temptation comes your way no matter how
[1:36:40] much Temptation we get in our lives it
[1:36:42] doesn't change the fact that he already
[1:36:44] sees us as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:36:46] that he has already washed us with those
[1:36:48] Waters of Separation to be his virtuous
[1:36:51] bride
[1:36:53] never did it in the first place
[1:36:56] let's just go to him in prayer gracious

[1:37:30] about you and we suddenly became a son
[1:37:32] or daughter of God you you made us a son
[1:37:34] or a daughter before the foundation of
[1:37:36] the world and we just recognized that
