meetings here trust the Lord will do something special for us this week just have one need that I'd like to bring before the church tonight and that's for brother Frank Cronkite there's a very serious need in his life he went in for the bladder surgery and the doctors didn't have a good report they said that his kidney is rock solid with a tumor and then it will no longer function and that the tumor is bad in the bladder and their recommendation is to take out all of the urinary tract and he will live on dialysis for the rest of his days so we would like to stand with the Cronkite family because we know that's not the right report we know that's a lie of the devil and we know that he does give us the healing and Grace that we need he gave us healing on this side of Eternity for a purpose we're not looking for the Millennium to have healing in these bodies the first drops of blood that hit the ground was from those 39 Stripes from the cat of nine tails so that we could receive healing so let's remember brother Frank Cronkite tonight as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful father for what you've done for us Lord because we know those drops of blood father they grew love oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus that we can just look away from the problems of this life and we can look away to Jesus father we know that you have given us provision in this life for a reason Lord and tonight father we just want to come to you as your children father as Sons and Daughters of the most high God as your lovely wife and we want to remind you of your word tonight father on behalf of brother Frank Cronkite Lord and father we pray that Lord Jesus you would just send the agent of the Holy Ghost over there to visit him in the hospital tonight Lord and father we just ask that you would do the surgery father that he needs so desperately tonight Lord we know that the doctor has a report but we know that you have a report and we know that it all comes down to whose report do we believe and tonight father we believe you father we believe you father we can't make it come to pass the only thing that we can do is unite together under one name father and that's your name and tonight father we do that we come according to your word father we unite together around the promise that you've given Lord Jesus if we can believe that all things are possible so father we pray that tonight we could just lay down our faith Lord and just take a hold of your faith Lord Jesus and allow your faith to do the work tonight Lord just like we prayed last week for brother Isaiah father we thank you for healing that boy in the name of Jesus Christ tonight Lord Jesus we thank you for healing brother Frank Cronkite Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father we know that you always answer our prayers Lord and we're so thankful that we can come to you with your word Lord Jesus we can have many words of our own but father we know that you said if we could just believe that all things are possible and father we know that tonight you are already on the scene with brother Frank and brother Pamela father we just want to remember Sister Pamela father as well that you would just strengthen and encourage her Lord and father through this trial through this situation that your perfect will would be done Lord Jesus because we know there's never any accidents in this world you you allow things to happen father there would be no cancer in brother Frank if you didn't first permit it Lord Jesus and we just ask that father the purpose of this trial would be accomplished father according to your desires Lord according to your will and will father will be careful to thank you for ministering Lord Jesus in every aspect Lord we pray for all the children Lord Jesus the Cronkite family Lord and the grandchildren father Lord we just ask that you would bear them all up on the wings of Eagles tonight father Lord that they would take courage knowing that there is a great physician that there is a bomb in Gilead that there is a holy ghost agent in the land tonight that you are the prophet father that you are the word you are the Living Word and father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord every day of our life Lord you have done so much for us and we thank you for it Lord thank you for meeting this tremendous need Lord Lord father we know that the devil wants to come and and boast his claim in the name of cancer but we run to him in the name of the Living God and Father we know that just like you did for David you could do for us father we love you and we thank you and we claim this promise in the name of Jesus Christ now we commit brother Frank and sister Pamela and the entire Cronkite family into your hands Lord now tonight father we just ask that you would have the preeminence Lord that you desire as we go forwards in this service father that you would just speak to us through our dear brother Gilbert Lord and father give us Hearts to receive that word as you speak to us along the way we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory we love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we just sing that Almighty infinite [Music] thankfully loving your own will invite brother to come now here we are weakness [Music] [Applause] [Music] are the one that we pray [Music] for us God bless you thank you musicians God bless you are you happy to be in the house of the Lord are you excited for the meetings yeah I'm not excited myself because if I was asked I would have preferred the pastor to start the meetings but because it has fallen my Lord that I stand before before you pray for me that I made something I may say something that can encourage somebody somewhere thanks for your prayers thanks for the songs of worship thanks for creating the environment for God to have his own way now because brother Paul you you you ate into my time I hope you will also anyway just take it on a right note I'm just trying to relax huh so that when I start firing at least we can move on okay [Music] let's turn to our bye boss Romans 8 11. a very familiar scripture if you are there you can say Amen I like hearing people turn the pages of the Bible so that I know they are serious amen before we read the word let us pray our most gracious Heavenly Father we are in your presence you ordained these meetings you ordained this service now we just want to return it back to your heavenly father so that you take control yourself from now up to the end I am the least amongst your children to stand before before the elect of the oh Lord but heavenly father I'm just praying in a humble way that you just take me out of the way so that you come down and speak to your children all my thoughts all my notes everything I've prepared father may you take away anything that is that will not be of benefit to your children we just want to surrender ourselves now to your will even now as we go to read your word may you bless it father for your own glory for it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray Romans 8 11. the Bible says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your motor bodies by his spirit that it weareth in you may God bless the reading of the word you can take your seats now from that scripture which says if the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwareth in you amen there is a condition there if if that spirit so for the next few minutes we are going to see how that Spirit dwareth In You and who is that spirit if we want to call the title of my sermon I've called it matured crane of wheat I know it has been preached by my brother somewhere so but uh if you can break it further I want to call it good news now what is good news good news is he said himself that because I live he shall live also that is good news Now that statement as much as it may look so good and so nice it is not addressed to everybody it is for specific people because I live he shall also live now who are these people that he was addressing to he was addressing to his own Pride it is only the pride who can say this scripture belongs to me any other person it is just a good story God help us because I live he shall live also now who is this that he was addressing to we have said that is the pride now let's go back in the beginning how he created The Pride their pride the first the first Pride was created through cesarean on Adam so the wife of Adam came from Adam himself not from somewhere else if she came from somewhere else they could have been fighting day and night but the pride came from himself now the second bride also came through caesarean on carvery so now when he says that it is because it is himself it is his own material and because he's Eternal then his material is also in tanu oh my God God help us I wish God can help us to see this you are in his mind you are in his thoughts so when he went to Calvary you went with him you were in him when he was being crucified you were in him that crucifixion was just so that the pride can come out of him now the time has come for the pride that came out of him now the pride is matured now if the pride is now mature then you can say I and my father are one if you are mature but you will see in a minute what a matured Pride can do what a mature at bright is supposed to be doing today why you are in his mind you are in his thoughts so you can do nothing except what he shows you can somebody say Amen to that you can do nothing except he shows you may God help us amen now this is the season for for the resurrection and uh what was in my mind and I think I talked to the pastor and he mentioned about it is to answer this question what does resurrection mean to you you know to some it's just a good story we can console ourselves living heal love D me dying is saved you can console yourself for that but what does it mean to you if you know what the resurrection means to you then you live a different life we live the way we live because we it has never come to our mind to know what this Resurrection means to us now in the message the rising of the sun paragraph 44 the prophet says today we have a tuberculosis Easter seal people sends message one to another and to support this great fund or drive for the doctors and medical science to work upon something to read that or to help the tuberculosis they are seal what we call an Easter seal when we send a message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken when you receive the message then that seal is broken now on the Easter morning he broke the seal no this this seal that he broke oh the wild was on the Gloom the Old Testament said the old people people could die and no hope no nothing but when he died allow me to go ahead of my son when he died the body was buried in the grave of Joseph but that's your funny lift that body went through the demons went up to hell that happened I said bring the keys because he was holding the kiss so he took back and it is bring the keys then he went back he went to Paradise for he was the hope that job was waiting for so he went with the key he unlocked the door what happened there was a resurrection so now he took the body and worked for 40 days [Laughter] he could feel he could eat yeah but he can appear and disappear [Laughter] there was good hinder him what happened they feel funny right here okay sorry it is restricting me as I cannot even jump okay okay okay okay are we together Sage now it's your funny that left the body in the grave and went to hell and picked the key that is the spirit that Paul is telling us that if the spirit that raised up Jesus dwellers in you he will Quicken your mother bodies so for you to talk about the resurrection now you need to identify yourself without theophany it is that it's your funny that will Quicken you it is that it's your funny that we can separate you from being a sinner to turn you to either into a saint it is not ethiophony and that's why the prophet says we have heard from our fearfulness and that is the Miracle that's going to happen not healing not even racing from the dead it was Saint [Music] that is the greatest miracle that can ever happen may God help us so that the resurrection what does the resurrection mean to you for you to identify the meaning of Resurrection you must come in contact with a theophany anything short of that you are just a church member God help us sorry somebody is eating my time okay so the resurrection is good news the resurrection is or the good news is because I live he shall live oh my okay now because of that statement that because I live he shall live then we can say the story of Jesus can become your story the story of Jesus can become your story you can say I have resurrected we are going to we are going to see it don't start fighting it in your mind we are going to we are going to see it how you are resurrected first resurrection you can say I was dead in sin and trespasses and now I know without doubt I have been changed you are not fighting no you know for sure something happened without doubt something happened I'm no longer the same sorry I'm not quarreling anybody [Laughter] oh my goodness we need to come to a point where we know what this Resurrection means to us okay the prophet says like this I am wondering today it's what is happening are we really getting the people to God or we are just getting them to church we must get them to Christ where this quickening power it is good to go to church sure if that's as far as we go it's not far enough when we come to church that is good but go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power foreign there are no two choices about it either you receive it or you just remain a church member but God is not interested in church members if brother topi may allow me to repeat this about The Game of Life God is interested in players not spectators the game can go on without spectators but it cannot go on without the players the players must be there and the coach must be there and the umbaya already the referee who is the absolute we heard about the absolute the other day so and when the absolute plus the whistle if you are a real player you stop you know the meaning of that whistle and when the when the Empire says it is of it is a goal some people with example some will complain they will destroy what they will throw whatever whatever they want to throw but it is final amen he was afghanistas he's a kidney Stars his Achilles me in this church but his what is so a player will respect the decision of the absolute or the umbaya but these Spectators will be complaining why did you put Daniel he's useless but you don't know the pain the player is going through how he's crying crying why he why he is crying to make things right but you being a spectator you are saying take him out of the church but remember he never again The Spectators are maturity Spectators are the majority so if where we are now is also a game then the spectators are majority but I want to be a player [Music] I want to be a player God help us paragraph 46. in the message the Easter seal the prophet says now notice the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell one that is one to tell to to show three to prove I wonder how many are in the resurrection today that you can tell you can show and you can prove you turn with your mouth confess then you have to show then what happens prove with your life I wonder how men are in the resurrection now God help us with me I'm just an evangelist and I've not even started evangelizing I'm trying to see where I can start but time is up we can finish I can leave it for another day but the truth of the matter is the resurrection become a reality not just to talk about it you can talk about it but you need to show and approve with your life can we ask for a test David said try me and prove me if you find any iniquity in me budget I wish we could come to a point where we honestly copy for God and say Lord patch me punch me help me I want to make it I want this Resurrection to become real in my life God help us now Resurrection is the matured crane I'll repeat it Resurrection is the matured crane which is the son of man now Jesus Christ or the Lord appeared in different forms Son of God of first son of man Son of God and the son of David but between the Son of God and the son of David in between here he sleeps in for what the purpose to fulfill the ministry of the son of man now who was son of man the son of man was the maturity seed in The Book of Leviticus on Friday it was the Feast of the Passover on Saturday morning he was the Feast of the unleavened bread then on Sunday it was there with saving now on Friday he was the Passover he was then depressed no sin on him even Pirates said oh I find no fault in him Believers find fault in your life pilot said I find no fault then what happened on Sunday morning he was weaved as the matured seed now if he was wefted as the maturity seed and we said earlier Ron that when he went to Calvary you are in him when he was crucified you are in him why because it was a process of caesarean so that now you can come out for what now to manifest so you can say or it is now your duty to prove that he's alive if you cannot prove that he's alive then you are taking him back in the grave but he resurrected to prove they claim that I can lay my life down and raise it up [Music] he proved it so we are here also to prove our claim that he is Resurrected can we prove it oh my goodness oh my so don't just sit there say Amen to the one as you a minute it it sucks in what happens so that when the old Taco is met or the worship comes your heart is ready to worship but if many of us we are so indifferent allow me to say this if you use friend there and Somebody's Crying casting out the demons those demons they will come to you because you have created an environment for the demons to come by your side so it is your responsibility cry Lord help me take away anything that may hinder that wants to flow from in my heart let me help me to surrender God help us amen now we are talking about the mature grain wheat grain of wheat now in Matthew 12. will I have time for that please just bear with me just bear with me let's read it it will help us Matthew 12. oh yes bus 38 then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall not no sign be given to the to to eat but the sign of the Prophet Jonas you can read up you can read and finish it what was the sign of Jonas it was the sign of Resurrection now these guys they wanted to sign but then he said an evil and adulterous generation they seek for a sign is there any other generation that is evil than this one so what is happening this is a generation of science Seekers if they hear there is a Prada who is doing discernments in Edmonton next Sunday almost everybody will drive to Ed Mundo no wonder some Believers have Arisen calling themselves Joshua and they have followers why this is the generation sign Seekers don't seek for the sign seek for the word inside the word it has life it has those signs seek for the word as you sit down pray for more revelation of the word God help us so there is no more advancement in the growth of wheat after the crime I want that one to sink why because the seed that went down is now when it matures it goes through a process when you see the husk the tassel and everything it doesn't look like a seat but inside there is life and that life is progressing to a certain point to the maturity now when it matures it will be like in the same same seed that went in the ground so now we are saying the crane has matured if it has matured then it is supposed to look exactly like the son of man that went down all right in fact he said if he abides alone there will be no crowd but he has to die so that it matte price now if it is to multiply where's the multiplication it is you and me [Applause] it is now you and me we are the multiplication so what we already need to do recognize Who You Are what God has made you what God what God has made you today just come to that realization as we go through the series of these meetings let your prayer be Lord I want to be more like you I just did a summary of what what is what is going to come but remember the theme is what does this resurrection mean to you if we can carry it through up to Sunday then at the end of these meetings we should be different people what does this resurrection mean to me I I I don't know about brother Dan or no what does it mean to me it is now personal let us personalize it what does it mean to me he proved the resurrection proved his claim he proved his claim now we make claims we need now to prove being a Believer is not carrying message books let their life let the life now flow in you then you can tell you can show and you can prove God help us hey amen okay my time is up but I've not even covered a quarter so God help us but I will leave you with this what does this resurrection mean to you what does this resurrection mean to you okay just allow me to read this then we can conclude there in the message proving his word we are talking about proving now with your life now proving his word the message paragraph 236 the prophet says now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern their thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the pride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head to unite the marriage of the pride and the bridegroom and the pride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestations of the revealing of the son of man what was the trip to to Tucson it was to reveal the word which word he was not the son of man but he was revealing the son of man for what so that the head can Unite with the body now once the head unites with the body then we can say now it is one but my consolation is this there is an invisible Union that is going on example is just surrendering Lord walk through me walk through me mold me into that character mold me into what you want me to be I am tired I am tired of my own life I want to live your life I want to live your life can that be our prayer for the meetings that we are going through can that be out can that be your prayer Lord may you walk through me may you walk at The Room walk on me Change Me Lord Let Me Lord you cannot make it the Way You Are done deal you Unite with the word so that you become the one once you become the word then you can say I am the proof that Jesus is Alive Simba's that let us stand what does resurrection mean to you it's a harvest time I don't know brother Paul do you know that song that used to I think brother Hilda brand used to sing it called Harvest time it's harvest time and I can't hear the combine coming to kada in the crane and take it home the combine harvester we can hear is coming but he's coming for the matured crane [Laughter] nothing short of that give us energy sisters
