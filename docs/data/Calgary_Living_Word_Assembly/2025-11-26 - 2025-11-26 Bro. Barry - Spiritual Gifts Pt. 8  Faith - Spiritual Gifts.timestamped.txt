[35:38] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[35:39] make it known unto him by way of an
[35:41] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[35:44] Just want to remember Sister Mary
[35:46] Olerte,
[35:48] the Sarpong family, brother Asher Snow.
[35:52] All of them are afflicted with an
[35:55] illness in their body tonight.
[35:58] Let's just pray.
[36:00] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[36:02] you that we can come to [music] you,
[36:04] Lord. Father, that we can come to you in
[36:08] spirit and in truth, Father, in the day
[36:10] in which we live. Oh, Father, it's no
[36:13] cliche and we don't take it for granted,
[36:15] Lord. The covenant that we live under,
[36:18] Father, the age where you chose to
[36:20] express us, Lord, to be the recipients
[36:23] of your word. and not just the
[36:25] recipients but after receiving your word
[36:28] to literally [music] become your word to
[36:30] this age. Father, we recognize it and we
[36:33] thank you for that calling Lord and that
[36:36] election that you have placed within us.
[36:38] And tonight, Father, is not any
[36:41] different than any other service. We
[36:44] know that you're here, Father. We
[36:45] declared this service to be in your name
[36:48] &gt;&gt; already tonight. And Father, we're so
[36:51] thankful that you're here. And Lord, we
[36:53] just invite you to take your preeminence
[36:56] to walk up and down the aisles tonight,
[36:58] Father, Lord Jesus, up and down the
[37:02] seats tonight, Father, from heart to
[37:04] heart, from tabernacle to tabernacle,
[37:07] Lord, and search us, Father, and try us,
[37:10] Lord. And help us, Father, to find our
[37:12] way one more time, Lord. If there's
[37:15] things in our lives that hinders your
[37:17] spirit, Father, from being welcome, we
[37:19] pray that Lord, you would help us
[37:21] [music] to recognize it, Lord, that we
[37:23] would be able to get rid of it from our
[37:25] lives, Lord. That there wouldn't be a
[37:27] hindrance from your spirit, Lord, where
[37:29] you wouldn't just come, Lord, and and
[37:31] then go again in our lives, Father, but
[37:33] that you would come and seal us once and
[37:35] for all, oh Lord Jesus, that we would,
[37:38] Lord, see you the way that you want to
[37:40] be seen in this age. Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask tonight,
[37:45] Lord, that you would forgive us for any
[37:46] sin in our lives, Lord. Any unbelief,
[37:49] Father, we pray that you would forgive
[37:51] us for it. And Lord, any iniquity in our
[37:53] hearts, please take it out of the way,
[37:55] Lord.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Father, let us approach you tonight with
[37:58] a clean heart, Father. Lord, that you
[38:01] could do something with us. As our
[38:03] brother already prayed, [music]
[38:04] it's one thing to come and speak, but
[38:06] it's another thing to be able to listen.
[38:08] We heard it on the weekend. Father, give
[38:10] us ears to hear. Oh, Father, we heard it
[38:13] in the Bible study this morning. Let us
[38:15] lend an ear to you, Father. Oh, Lord
[38:17] Jesus, that we could hear what your
[38:19] spirit has to say.
[38:21] Father, we just want to remember each
[38:23] and every need that was made known unto
[38:25] you tonight by the way of an uplift
[38:27] hand. We commit them sovereignly into
[38:29] your hands, Lord. And we'll be careful
[38:31] to give you the praise for answering our
[38:32] prayers because we know that we won't
[38:35] ask a miss if we ask according to your
[38:38] will. Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And Father, that's the way we present
[38:41] our needs tonight,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; not to consume them upon the lust of our
[38:47] lives, Lord. And Father, tonight we pray
[38:49] that you would be glorified [music] in
[38:51] each and every testimony as they come
[38:52] forward.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to pray for Brother
[38:55] Asher Snow tonight, Lord, that you would
[38:57] minister unto him.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; We want to pray for the Sarong family
[39:01] entirely, Lord. Sister Helen, Brother
[39:04] Emanuel,
[39:06] oh Father, Sister Chloe, Brother Benny,
[39:09] and Brother Andy. Lord, we pray that
[39:10] [music] you would just send by their way
[39:13] a healing touch tonight, Father.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Even now while we speak, we pray for
[39:18] each one, the Sarong, the olares, oh
[39:21] Father, in the snows. Lord, we know that
[39:24] you're more than able and we thank you
[39:26] for just touching them now in the name
[39:28] of Jesus. Father, tonight now as we turn
[39:31] to your word, we pray that you would
[39:33] continue to be worshiped, Father.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't just end at the song
[39:38] service, Father, that you would just
[39:40] allow us to worship you tonight in
[39:43] spirit and in truth, Father, all the way
[39:46] to the very end. And even as we go home
[39:48] tonight, Father, as we travel, maybe
[39:50] when we lay our head on the pillow, oh,
[39:52] Father, let our last breath be worship
[39:54] to you tonight as we fall asleep. And
[39:57] Lord, let our dreams be worship unto
[39:59] you, Father. Lord, let it be the first
[40:01] word that we speak when we wake up in
[40:03] the morning. Pure worship in spirit and
[40:06] in truth, Lord. Father, you've caused us
[40:09] to be here in this time so that we can
[40:12] worship you, Father. Lord Jesus, we love
[40:14] you and we thank you for that revelation
[40:17] of worship tonight. We just commit this
[40:20] service into your hands now. In Jesus
[40:22] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[40:26] Amen. Thank you musicians one more time
[40:30] for putting your shoulders to the wheel.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; We just want to read from 1 Corinthians
[40:35] chapter 12 again tonight as we continue
[40:37] on with our study about gifts.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] We sure had a busy weekend this weekend
[40:54] and
[40:57] we certainly are thankful to
[41:00] have been able to feast on the word.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one says,
[41:08] "Now concerning spiritual gifts,
[41:10] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[41:13] You [snorts] know that ye were Gentiles
[41:15] carried away unto these dumb idols, even
[41:18] as ye were led.
[41:20] Wherefore I give you to understand
[41:23] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[41:25] God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no
[41:29] man can say that Jesus is the Lord
[41:33] but by the Holy Ghost. And we know that
[41:36] it's not just saying that Jesus is the
[41:39] Lord but living as Jesus is the Lord. It
[41:43] means surrendering one's entire being,
[41:46] one's entire will is the only way that
[41:50] we can call him Lord. And the only way
[41:52] that happens is by the Holy Ghost in our
[41:54] lives.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Now, there are diversities of gifts, but
[41:58] the same spirit.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And there are differences of
[42:01] administrations, but the same Lord.
[42:05] And there are diversities of operations,
[42:09] but it is the same God which workketh
[42:11] all in all. And and I just as I'm
[42:14] reading this, I think it's beautiful
[42:15] because it doesn't say now there are
[42:16] diversities of opinions.
[42:20] It doesn't say that.
[42:23] Verse six says, "And there are
[42:24] diversities of operations, but it is the
[42:27] same God which workketh all in all. But
[42:30] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[42:32] to every man to profit with all. For for
[42:36] to one is given by the spirit the word
[42:38] of wisdom, to another the word of
[42:40] knowledge by the same spirit, to another
[42:44] faith by the same spirit, to another the
[42:48] gifts of healing by the same spirit. to
[42:52] another working of miracles. To another
[42:57] prophecy, to another discerning of
[43:00] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[43:03] tongues, and to another the
[43:06] interpretation of tongues.
[43:09] But all these workketh that one and the
[43:12] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[43:15] severally, as he will. Amen.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; For as the body is one and hath many
[43:22] members, and all the members of that one
[43:25] body being many, are one body, so also
[43:29] is Christ.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit, are we all baptized
[43:35] into one body.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
[43:40] whether we be bond or free, and have
[43:44] been all made to drink into one spirit.
[43:48] For the body is not one member but many.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[43:56] Father, we thank you for the many
[43:58] membered body that you have given
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. And we know this many
[44:02] membered body isn't just Lord exclusive
[44:05] to this age. It's not just exclusive to
[44:08] this church assembly here. Oh father,
[44:11] it's to all of the ages. And Father, we
[44:14] thank you that it is exclusive to every
[44:17] single one of the items that we've
[44:20] mentioned, Father. That it is to be
[44:22] operational even in this congregation,
[44:24] Father, according to your prophet. And
[44:27] Lord, we know that's your word. So we
[44:29] just take it the way that you've given
[44:31] it. And Lord, we commit the reading of
[44:33] this word into your hands one more time
[44:35] tonight that you would bless it. Father,
[44:38] break it open to us fresh once again. we
[44:40] ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[44:43] Amen.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[44:46] seated.
[44:48] We're certainly thankful to have
[44:51] brother Dodie and his family here with
[44:53] us tonight.
[44:55] They had quite an episode on the weekend
[44:58] and I didn't realize it until after.
[45:00] They didn't come to service. They were
[45:02] on their way to service here on Sunday
[45:04] and they pulled over on the side of the
[45:06] road and had to call an ambulance for
[45:08] Sister Leia. They I guess encountered
[45:11] food poisoning over the weekend and uh I
[45:15] don't know how many in the family were
[45:16] sick but it sounds like most if not all
[45:20] somehow got food poisoning and that is
[45:22] not a pretty picture. Food poisoning is
[45:25] a very painful event and uh we're
[45:27] certainly thankful that the Lord's
[45:30] answered prayer and that you're able to
[45:31] be here to fellowship with us tonight.
[45:33] So God bless you.
[45:35] We uh just have one announcement
[45:39] tonight. I think it's really good. Um
[45:42] what we've decided to do is start
[45:43] posting the announcements
[45:46] uh just on the chat. So if you want to
[45:49] be able to refer back, you can just look
[45:51] at your chat and scroll back and and see
[45:54] it. And uh if there's something
[45:56] happening that's uh maybe not been
[45:58] announced, we'll try and put it there so
[46:00] there is a point of reference. But all
[46:03] of the things that are happening um are
[46:05] on the calendar as well for reference
[46:07] and that's on the website if you do have
[46:10] any questions.
[46:12] Um certainly thankful to be here
[46:14] tonight. It's been a bit of a different
[46:16] week changing gears in the weather. We
[46:19] now have uh winter upon us. Certainly
[46:22] thankful for today though. It felt like
[46:23] a little bit of a shinook happening. It
[46:25] just wasn't that cold and the snow was
[46:27] starting to melt. But I saw the forecast
[46:30] is calling for more snow and more cold.
[46:34] So, here we go. I think uh I think we're
[46:36] in for it now. But, you know, it's the
[46:38] season for it, isn't it?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; It's just the way it is. Uh we have to
[46:42] go through the seasons of life and we
[46:44] have to go through the seasons on earth
[46:46] here as well.
[46:48] We uh certainly enjoyed the services on
[46:51] the weekend with brother Cadre and uh
[46:54] you know there's so many so many points
[46:57] that were so so good. I just really
[47:00] appreciate it and uh appreciate the
[47:02] ministry of the the brother cadre. He's
[47:05] gone through a lot and uh certainly
[47:07] thank the Lord for how he's using him
[47:09] and you know I I believe so much. I just
[47:13] couldn't say amen enough, you know, with
[47:15] the the spirit and the truth that we've
[47:17] been given the Saturday night service
[47:20] and to understand that spiritual
[47:22] revelation of worship is something that
[47:26] is just it's just you can't even put
[47:29] words to it to think about our lives.
[47:31] Even every part of our lives is a
[47:35] revelation of worship. When we catch the
[47:38] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[47:41] the age of which we live, when we get
[47:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our
[47:45] lives, it is not just an anointing. It's
[47:48] literally the life of Jesus living out
[47:50] through us. And and that's where we can
[47:52] say that we do become the word. And and
[47:55] we don't make excuses for our old self.
[47:58] We want to see our old self die. You
[48:00] know, when we start making excuses for
[48:02] the old self, we're saying that he's not
[48:04] powerful enough to actually change this
[48:06] guy.
[48:07] We're saying that our old self is more
[48:10] powerful than almighty God. And brother
[48:13] Brandham said it. We know he said it
[48:14] under anointing and the invisible union
[48:16] of the bride. I always say this, but
[48:18] I'll say it again. Every single speck of
[48:21] the old man has to die. And tonight, I
[48:24] want to say it with conviction to each
[48:26] and every one of us. We've got to see
[48:28] that happen. To make excuses is it's
[48:32] making excuses. And I want to say this,
[48:35] we're we're looking for a copout when
[48:37] we're making excuses. And and you know,
[48:39] brothers and sisters, if we haven't seen
[48:40] that change in our lives, it doesn't
[48:42] mean it won't happen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Because it is happening. Every single
[48:46] time we come to church, every single
[48:48] time we gather together in the name of
[48:50] the Lord Jesus Christ, something
[48:52] happens. We either grow or we shrink,
[48:54] but we do not remain the same.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because it can be
[48:59] just like a little child. a little child
[49:02] when they when they are with their
[49:03] parents and maybe they go and see a
[49:05] great auntie and they haven't seen her
[49:07] for so many years, maybe months or
[49:10] years, and and the last time that she
[49:12] saw them, they were this tall and and
[49:15] they get together and and now they're
[49:17] this tall and and the child probably
[49:19] doesn't feel any taller. And the parents
[49:20] that see them every single week, they're
[49:22] like, "Yeah, that's exactly how they
[49:24] are. They haven't changed that much."
[49:25] But the person that hasn't really seen
[49:27] them says, "Wow, look at the change in
[49:29] your life. you've grown so much. When it
[49:33] happens in our lives, sometimes we don't
[49:35] recognize it because it's so gradual.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; It's not always a thunderbolt experience
[49:40] in our lives, but it doesn't mean it's
[49:42] not happening.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to remember to not get
[49:46] weary with welloing.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; When we come to church on a Wednesday
[49:50] night, for example, and it feels like
[49:52] nothing's happening, Brother Barry's
[49:54] just going to go on about the gifts
[49:55] again. Going to talk about faith some
[49:56] more, read some more quotes. That's just
[49:58] the devil talking. and tell them to get
[50:00] lost and say, "Be it unto me according
[50:03] to your word, Lord. Somehow, some way,
[50:05] you could say something to me if I get
[50:07] out of the way and allow you to move."
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom said that these gifts
[50:14] should be in the body and every single
[50:15] sovereign church
[50:17] &gt;&gt; should be these gifts.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; So, that's why I'm so encouraged to talk
[50:21] about them. I just felt so so driven to
[50:24] to really get into them, to dig into
[50:26] them, because we're not seeking signs.
[50:28] What I want to do is help create a level
[50:31] of faith inside of us that we are not
[50:33] afraid of them.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Because if we have fear about these
[50:37] gifts, we've got another spirit.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; There's another spirit operating in our
[50:41] life if we're afraid of gifts.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty heavy thing to say, but
[50:47] I think it's 100% true.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; And I would be very interested in having
[50:51] a conversation if somebody sees it
[50:53] differently. I I'm not looking to
[50:55] combat, but what I do want to do is kick
[50:57] the devil out.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want the devil having any power
[51:00] in the congregation. We only want to see
[51:03] the Lord Jesus Christ reigning supreme
[51:05] in our midst.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; But if there's fear, it's not God
[51:11] &gt;&gt; because his word says that I've not
[51:12] given you the spirit of fear. I've given
[51:14] you the spirit of power and of love and
[51:17] of a sound mind.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So that we can comprehend these things,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; not be afraid of them. Yes.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Brandham said,
[51:25] "Where there's scarecrows, what should
[51:27] we do?" Anybody remember what what we
[51:30] should do? He said, "You should go right
[51:33] in behind that scarecrow and start
[51:34] eating because that's where the good
[51:36] food is. That's where the good fruit
[51:38] is." The scarecrow is there to scare us
[51:41] away. But we're not crows, are we?
[51:44] &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about scarecrows.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Talking about the gifts in the body, I
[51:49] just think it's beautiful. They should
[51:50] be in every single sovereign assembly.
[51:52] We've read that quote many times. Not
[51:54] going to read it tonight. Tonight I'm
[51:56] I'm supercharged
[51:58] by Perfect Faith 1963.
[52:02] If you want to just see where this is
[52:04] coming from, just listen to Perfect
[52:06] Faith. We're talking about faith
[52:07] tonight. We've talked about wisdom.
[52:09] We've talked about knowledge. Tonight
[52:10] we're talking about faith. I'm probably
[52:12] not going to dwell too much longer on
[52:13] faith because I do want to get through
[52:15] the gifts. I want to talk about them.
[52:17] But we'll see that these gifts will pop
[52:19] up, I think, in the future uh services
[52:22] as as the Lord leads. I think it's just
[52:24] wonderful as we study these things. And
[52:27] you know, I I just won't be surprised at
[52:30] all when we start seeing these things in
[52:31] our midst. I always wondered about it
[52:33] how you could see some maybe evangelists
[52:36] or some ministers who maybe somehow
[52:40] someway people just get healed when they
[52:42] get around them. Maybe they have a
[52:44] prayer line and and something happens
[52:46] and and people get healed. You know,
[52:48] there's a gift of healing
[52:50] and and that gift of healing is placed
[52:52] in a person's life sovereignly as the
[52:55] Lord wills. It's not up to us to say I
[52:58] I'm not going to say that every one of
[52:59] us should have every one of these gifts
[53:01] in our lives. I think in fact, it's the
[53:03] contrary. We probably just have maybe a
[53:06] portion of or the solid amount of a
[53:09] specific gift in our lives. And and
[53:11] that's just the way it is. They're all
[53:13] members of the body. And that's what
[53:16] makes up the body is the many members.
[53:18] And you know, you can't have a body, we
[53:20] can't have a body without a heart,
[53:22] right?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; We can't have a body without lungs,
[53:24] without a spleen, without a liver. Um,
[53:27] you can go without two kidneys. You can
[53:30] have just one kidney, but you know, we
[53:32] got to have a brain. There's things that
[53:34] we need to have in order to be a
[53:36] complete body or it just doesn't work.
[53:39] I I just thought it was wonderful as we
[53:41] were reading this tonight. You know, it
[53:43] just came to me that there's diversities
[53:45] of gifts, but the same spirit. And
[53:47] there's differences of administrations
[53:50] and there's diversities of operations,
[53:52] but there's no differences of opinion
[53:56] &gt;&gt; when it comes to this because it's the
[53:58] self-same spirit. And how can you tell
[54:00] if if if it is the right spirit? It's
[54:03] going to line up with the word of God.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why I think we don't have to
[54:07] have any fear. here. And I want to
[54:08] encourage us to remember this. We don't
[54:10] have to fear gifts because it is the
[54:13] spirit of God. It will always be
[54:16] according to his word.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Always.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; That's why if we surrender ourselves to
[54:21] the word of God, we've got nothing to
[54:23] fear.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; But now I'll say this. If we're living a
[54:27] double life, if we've just got that
[54:29] thing we're just not willing to get rid
[54:31] of, eventually it's going to come to the
[54:33] surface. We can't escape it. But when it
[54:37] does, what do we do with it? That's the
[54:39] difference between a believer and an
[54:41] unbeliever. A believer is going to say,
[54:43] "I'm sorry. Forgive me, Lord. I know
[54:46] that I'm wrong.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Will you forgive me? It's this thing
[54:49] that I just feel like I can never seem
[54:51] to get over." But the unbeliever or the
[54:54] makebeliever is going to be like, "I'm
[54:56] just fine. What's wrong with me? There's
[54:58] nothing wrong with me. It's you."
[55:00] But remember, when we start pointing,
[55:02] there's still three fingers pointing
[55:04] right back at us, right?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we know where
[55:08] we stand.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; If we have the same spirit, it's going
[55:12] to line up exactly with God's word. And
[55:15] and if, like I said, we're not actually
[55:17] lining up with the word of God. If we
[55:19] are a believer, we will line up with the
[55:21] word of God. Tonight, I want to talk
[55:22] about faith and and how faith how vital
[55:26] faith is in the life of a believer.
[55:29] Faith is it's like our spiritual blood
[55:33] &gt;&gt; because without faith it's impossible to
[55:35] please God.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Without blood it's impossible to live.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; We can't get oxygen to ourselves without
[55:42] blood.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; We have to have faith.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; It's the substance of things hoped for
[55:48] and it's the evidence of things not
[55:50] seen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; I've got a bunch of quotes tonight I'm
[55:52] going to get into that brother Brandham
[55:54] mentions in this in this message and I
[55:56] think it's just so beautiful the way he
[55:57] says it. You know, it's the person of
[55:59] the Holy Ghost that we're talking about.
[56:01] That's that's what faith is. The person
[56:04] of the Holy Ghost because how could any
[56:07] human being ever just believe in God's
[56:08] word? No human being on their own could
[56:11] ever just believe in God's word. It
[56:13] takes more than that to just believe in
[56:16] God's word. People could say they
[56:17] believe in God's word, but when it comes
[56:19] to actually changing how we live our
[56:21] lives, it's a different story altogether
[56:24] to be able to believe and live the word
[56:27] of God.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But it becomes the person of the Holy
[56:30] Ghost living through us, mighty Jehovah,
[56:34] Jesus Christ. It's not another spirit.
[56:36] And sometimes it's it's kind of
[56:38] presented in a way that it's some other
[56:40] spirit, but it's not another spirit.
[56:42] It's the same self, same spirit as we've
[56:45] read in this scripture. You know, out of
[56:49] perfect faith, brother Brandham, he
[56:50] talks about complete faith and he talks
[56:53] about mature faith. And I believe that
[56:57] that is what exactly what perfect faith,
[57:01] the title of this sermon, is actually
[57:03] speaking about. It's speaking about a
[57:06] faith that is complete because
[57:08] perfection in the Bible talks about
[57:09] completion. That is the definition of
[57:13] mature of of perfect is is complete and
[57:17] and mature faith. So tonight I just want
[57:21] to mention brother Brandham. He speaks
[57:24] about faith in titles of messages 44
[57:28] times in the message. There's faith
[57:31] included in the title and and I just
[57:33] thought perfect faith fits it. I mean,
[57:35] if we were if I was to take and preach
[57:37] on on faith just in terms of the titles,
[57:41] sermon titles, we would probably have
[57:44] two or three years worth of material to
[57:46] go through. And and I just I don't want
[57:48] to do that. I don't want to keep us
[57:50] stuck on one part of it. There's there's
[57:52] many gifts in the body, and I want to be
[57:54] able to just try and go through and
[57:56] study a bit and and learn and just bring
[57:58] some encouragement to the body. But if
[58:00] you want to maybe just listen to perfect
[58:02] faith in 1963 if you have the time. It's
[58:05] it's pretty good. It's pretty good. You
[58:08] know, brother Brandham in this message
[58:10] he talks about Mark 11:22
[58:13] to 26.
[58:15] I'm just going to read out of perfect
[58:16] faith here. He says, "Now faith is
[58:19] based, I love this. This is the very
[58:22] first quote. Faith is based on
[58:26] forgiveness.
[58:28] Faith is based on forgiveness. Can you
[58:32] believe that? It's based on forgiveness.
[58:35] That's the foundation of faith
[58:37] &gt;&gt; is forgiveness. So if we got
[58:40] unforgiveness in our lives, if we've got
[58:42] something where someone has hurt us in
[58:44] our lives and we're just holding on to
[58:46] it and we're not willing to forgive that
[58:48] person,
[58:49] do we have faith?
[58:52] I don't think so. We we might have an
[58:55] intellectual faith, but we're not
[58:56] talking about intellectual faith. You'll
[58:58] see what brother Brandham talks about
[58:59] that. We're talking about perfect faith,
[59:01] complete faith, mature faith. He says,
[59:04] "Now faith is based on forgiveness
[59:06] then." And then, as we said this
[59:09] morning, trying to get the church into a
[59:13] place to where we could really see
[59:15] apostolic times moving among us. Who
[59:18] doesn't want to see apostolic times
[59:20] moving among us? Praise.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, some people might say, "Well, that
[59:25] was with brother Brandham back in 1963
[59:27] and he was a prophet and he held an
[59:29] office and the angel told him with his
[59:32] commission that if you pray and you get
[59:34] the people to believe that not even
[59:35] cancer will stand in the way of your
[59:36] prayers." And that was just for him. If
[59:39] that's what we're thinking, then we've
[59:40] missed the mark.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; We've completely missed the mark because
[59:45] we are the recipients of his message.
[59:48] Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; His message wasn't even his message.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; His message IS GOD'S MESSAGE FOR THE
[59:56] BRIDE TO BRING MATURITY, COMPLETENESS.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Now, the faith faith is based on
[1:00:03] forgiveness then. And then, as we said
[1:00:05] this morning, trying to get the church
[1:00:06] to a place to where we could really see
[1:00:08] apostolic times moving among us. That's
[1:00:10] what we all hunger and it's just laying
[1:00:13] right at the door. We see it, but we
[1:00:17] want to see more of it.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; We want to see, we want it such a flow
[1:00:25] that it'll be a help to us.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Help us flow out to others.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Because remember what he said in the
[1:00:33] message, eternal life is
[1:00:36] living for others,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; not living for ourselves.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Mark 11.
[1:00:44] Faith is based upon forgiveness.
[1:00:49] Mark chapter 11.
[1:00:55] Mark 11.
[1:01:04] Mark 11 22.
[1:01:12] And Jesus answering saith unto them,
[1:01:14] have faith in God.
[1:01:17] For verily I say unto you, can you
[1:01:19] imagine? He says, "Have faith in God."
[1:01:21] Jesus says, "Have faith in God."
[1:01:25] And then God begins to speak to them.
[1:01:28] God says, "Have faith in God."
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; For verily I say unto you,
[1:01:36] let's not put this off on a second
[1:01:38] person of Jesus or a third person of
[1:01:40] Jesus. Let's put this right back on. The
[1:01:43] author of these words, we could say, God
[1:01:46] answering saith unto them, "Have faith
[1:01:49] in me.
[1:01:51] For verily I say unto you, that
[1:01:53] whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be
[1:01:56] thou removed, and be cast into the sea,
[1:01:58] and shall not doubt in his heart, but
[1:02:00] shall believe that those things which he
[1:02:03] saith shall come to pass. He shall have
[1:02:06] whatever he saith.
[1:02:08] Therefore, I say unto you, what things
[1:02:12] soever ye desire when ye pray, believe
[1:02:16] that ye receive them, and ye shall have
[1:02:19] them.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; It's so beautiful because that's where
[1:02:25] we live, right? Verse 25. And when ye
[1:02:28] stand praying, what?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Forgive.
[1:02:36] When you stand praying, it doesn't say
[1:02:38] exercise faith. It doesn't say do any
[1:02:42] spiritual work. It says forgive.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive.
[1:02:50] If ye have ought against any,
[1:02:54] that your father also
[1:02:57] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[1:03:01] trespasses.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] How will he know your trespasses?
[1:03:07] Because he knows our heart.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; All things are naked before him is his
[1:03:12] word.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; We can fool ourselves and say, "I've
[1:03:15] I've dealt with I've put it under the
[1:03:17] blood." We talked about this years ago.
[1:03:18] I thought it was so good. Sometimes we
[1:03:20] do that in our lives. We'll go and we'll
[1:03:22] actually say, "Lord, forgive me for
[1:03:24] doing that. I said that about that
[1:03:25] person." Or, "I did that to that person.
[1:03:28] Just forgive me, Lord." And and we just
[1:03:30] put it under the blood. But what we do
[1:03:33] is we actually we take it and we just
[1:03:35] put it under the rug.
[1:03:38] We put it under the rug because Jesus
[1:03:41] said if you've got a problem with a
[1:03:42] person, go to that person.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Just making it right with him, it
[1:03:48] doesn't make it right.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Bradam told the
[1:03:52] story of the woman that wanted Brother
[1:03:54] Bradom to fix her problem. And and he
[1:03:57] said, "What do you want?" And she said,
[1:03:59] "I got this problem and I don't know
[1:04:00] what to do about it." And he said,
[1:04:01] "Well, you cheated on your husband.
[1:04:03] That's your problem. Go tell him that
[1:04:05] you cheated on him." And she said,
[1:04:06] "There's no way. Don't you dare tell
[1:04:08] anybody that." Blah, blah, blah. She got
[1:04:10] all angry and indifferent. He said,
[1:04:11] "Good. I'm glad I could help. Have a
[1:04:13] nice day." And he went next door. And
[1:04:16] she started lamenting and screaming,
[1:04:18] "Oh, you didn't fix my problem." Well,
[1:04:19] it's not up to him to fix the problem in
[1:04:21] the first place, but he told her how you
[1:04:24] can fix your problem. Go tell your
[1:04:26] husband you cheated on him. Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; I can't do that on my Sunday school. All
[1:04:32] the stuff, right?
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Humanity gets in the way sometimes of
[1:04:37] our our pleading, our desire to to seek
[1:04:40] forgiveness.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; That pride, oh my, that pride. But you
[1:04:44] know, it took a prophet to actually come
[1:04:46] to the place where he could tell this
[1:04:48] woman. And you know, that was an example
[1:04:50] for us in our lives, for us to recognize
[1:04:53] that, you know, we might think that
[1:04:55] maybe we're squeaky clean and there's
[1:04:56] nothing wrong in our lives, but I
[1:04:58] guarantee you, brothers and sisters,
[1:04:59] we've all got blind spots.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Everything before God is naked. Don't
[1:05:05] let pride get in the way of our
[1:05:07] forgiveness.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But it took a prophet of God to tell
[1:05:12] her, just go tell him because he's got
[1:05:14] the same thing to tell you.
[1:05:17] Does he have a secretary? Does she wear
[1:05:19] this kind of dress? Do they drive this
[1:05:21] kind of car? Were they parked IN THIS
[1:05:23] LOCATION? GO ASK THEM.
[1:05:27] It's based on forgiveness. And what
[1:05:30] happened when they got it out of the way
[1:05:32] between them? Then they could go to God
[1:05:34] and get on with things.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. He knows our
[1:05:40] hearts. We're not going to hide. Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 26 says, "But if you do not
[1:05:46] forgive, neither will your father which
[1:05:48] is in heaven forgive you your
[1:05:49] trespasses." And you know, brothers and
[1:05:51] sisters, I'll say this. There's things
[1:05:52] that happen in life that can't be taken
[1:05:55] back. There's things that happen in life
[1:05:57] that are shattering to people, to human
[1:06:00] beings. And sometimes people will rather
[1:06:04] worship that problem than actually say,
[1:06:07] "Lord, take it from me.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Take it from me, Lord.
[1:06:12] How could someone how could someone for
[1:06:15] example I know we all have problems. We
[1:06:18] all have situations in our lives. But
[1:06:20] how could a mother actually go into a
[1:06:22] courtroom and and forgive a man that
[1:06:26] actually willfully killed her son?
[1:06:30] He deliberately killed her son. How
[1:06:32] could a woman go into a courtroom and
[1:06:34] actually say, "I forgive you." to the
[1:06:37] man that actually killed her son. Now,
[1:06:39] we can back up and say, "Well, there's
[1:06:41] many different things that I've got in
[1:06:42] my life, problems in my life, hurts in
[1:06:44] my life, and you know, I just don't seem
[1:06:46] to be able to let go of those hurts, and
[1:06:48] I'm just going to hold on to those hurts
[1:06:49] because they hurt." And you don't know
[1:06:51] how bad they hurt me. How bad did Christ
[1:06:55] get hurt?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; How bad was his hurt? No man has ever
[1:06:59] been hurt like he's been hurt.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; But yet, he's got forgiveness for us for
[1:07:04] every single shortcoming and blind spot
[1:07:06] in our lives. He'll take it and throw it
[1:07:08] into the sea of his what?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But we want to hold on to those things
[1:07:14] in our life because someone really did
[1:07:16] us wrong. They really hurt us bad. So
[1:07:19] we've got license now, right? No, we
[1:07:22] don't. What does that? I'll tell you
[1:07:24] what does that. Pride does that.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's a spirit of pride.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Just rebuke it in the name of Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; and allow that forgiveness to come into
[1:07:34] your life. Because faith, if we want to
[1:07:36] see this kind of faith, like gifts in
[1:07:38] the body faith, like rapturing faith,
[1:07:40] like bodychanging faith, like we want to
[1:07:43] see in our lives, then we've got to be
[1:07:44] willing to forgive every single
[1:07:46] transgression that comes against us.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone.
[1:07:50] Everyone
[1:07:52] without exception. There's no
[1:07:54] exceptions.
[1:07:55] I think it's beautiful, brother
[1:07:56] Brandham. He says this, "Faith is based
[1:07:58] on forgiveness." Then
[1:08:01] my
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] He goes on to say in the message, "Now
[1:08:06] we want to speak now upon faith and a
[1:08:10] different type of faith, not just faith
[1:08:13] of the fathers, even though that's what
[1:08:15] this message did, right? It turned the
[1:08:17] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:08:18] of the Pentecostal fathers. We probably
[1:08:20] still haven't gotten totally into that
[1:08:22] yet, and I'm going to, Lord willing."
[1:08:24] What is that? That's actually going
[1:08:26] right back to the book of Acts. Right
[1:08:28] back to the book of Acts. the acts of
[1:08:30] the Holy Ghost in the apostles. Not the
[1:08:33] acts of the apostles like the world
[1:08:35] teaches. It's the acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:37] in the apostles, fully surrendered
[1:08:39] vessels. Now, we want to speak now upon
[1:08:43] faith and a different type of faith,
[1:08:45] perfect faith. That's a great thing.
[1:08:48] Now, faith, we're told in the Bible,
[1:08:50] faith cometh by hearing. Now, you cannot
[1:08:54] be saved without faith. Isn't that
[1:08:57] amazing? You can't be saved without
[1:09:00] faith.
[1:09:02] I can't be saved without faith. And
[1:09:04] faith is something that you have to
[1:09:06] believe it's there. That really nothing
[1:09:09] else will declare it's there but faith.
[1:09:13] That's exactly what drives us to go
[1:09:16] across the city in the winter to be in
[1:09:19] service on a Wednesday night to hear the
[1:09:21] word of God. We can't explain it. You
[1:09:24] can't necessarily hand it to someone and
[1:09:26] say, "This is what I'm going to do. You
[1:09:28] You got to go see for yourself.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's faith. That God will do something
[1:09:34] for me."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's so beautiful
[1:09:37] because we've heard it said in the past
[1:09:38] that it's not always about what God will
[1:09:40] do for me. Remember, eternal life is
[1:09:42] living for others. And sometimes going
[1:09:44] to service might not be for us. It might
[1:09:47] be for your brother. It might be for
[1:09:49] your sister
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; because they'll see that you're there.
[1:09:53] And the devil's working hard on them to
[1:09:55] make them think, "Why are you going to
[1:09:56] church? Why are you wasting your gas?
[1:09:58] Why are you going to do this?" Blah,
[1:10:00] blah, blah. You could be doing so many
[1:10:01] other different things. You could be
[1:10:02] doing a business deal where you're
[1:10:04] actually really making good money, but
[1:10:06] instead you're going to church again.
[1:10:11] But your brother, your sister are going
[1:10:12] to look over and see that you're there,
[1:10:14] and they're going to say, "Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; There's my brother. There's my sister.
[1:10:19] We're locked arm in arm marching onto
[1:10:21] Zion because it's what we do every week.
[1:10:24] We get together and worship.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; The next quote he says, "Now faith, he
[1:10:30] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:10:32] is."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We have to believe that he is not was or
[1:10:37] will be is. It's so beautiful. Brother
[1:10:40] Brandham talks about it so many times in
[1:10:42] the message. We can be busy thinking
[1:10:43] about what he's going to do in the
[1:10:44] future and looking back to what he's
[1:10:45] done in the past and a tremendous
[1:10:47] prophet's life. and first and second
[1:10:48] pole ministries and all the wonder
[1:10:50] wonderful signs and wonders that
[1:10:52] happened but ignoring what he's doing
[1:10:55] right now
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; missing what he's doing right now
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; now faith he that cometh to God must
[1:11:02] believe that he is
[1:11:05] and it's impossible to please God
[1:11:08] without faith you cannot please him and
[1:11:11] if you say you believe God
[1:11:14] you have never seen him see So then
[1:11:17] you've got to believe it by faith.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And if you could see him, it would be no
[1:11:25] more faith. See,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; isn't that interesting?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; If we could see him, it would be no more
[1:11:32] faith.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Because our senses have nothing to do
[1:11:36] with it. I love how Brother Brandham
[1:11:39] brings this out because many times we
[1:11:41] could get into a worship service and we
[1:11:43] could sense something so tremendous in
[1:11:45] here, but that's not it.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; It is, but it's not all of it. That's
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's only a little portion of it. We can
[1:11:56] fall under the anointing of the Holy
[1:11:59] Spirit falling in a service. We sing,
[1:12:01] "Holy Spirit, rain down." Guess what? He
[1:12:03] comes where he's invited.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] But then if we're not sealed, that
[1:12:09] anointing is just going to lift and
[1:12:10] we're going to walk out of the building
[1:12:11] the same way or even worse than when we
[1:12:13] came in.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; He says if you've never seen him, see,
[1:12:18] so then you've got to believe it by
[1:12:20] faith. And if you could see him, it
[1:12:22] would no more be faith. See, anything
[1:12:24] that senses declares is no more faith.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; It's scientific fact.
[1:12:33] See, it's no more faith.
[1:12:37] That one actually I had to stop and
[1:12:39] rewind and play and just press pause and
[1:12:43] just ponder cuz how many times in our
[1:12:46] life do we see things? Do we sense
[1:12:49] things? Do we feel things? Do we even
[1:12:52] think things that are about our lives?
[1:12:55] And and we wonder what's going on. I I
[1:12:58] think it's amazing when we look at this.
[1:13:00] Anything that senses declares. Now
[1:13:04] remember, we've got earthly senses.
[1:13:06] We've been given senses so that we can
[1:13:09] contact this world.
[1:13:12] See, taste, feel, smell, and hearing.
[1:13:16] Right?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; The five outer senses are so that we can
[1:13:19] contact this world. Now, there's five
[1:13:21] inner senses, too. Reasoning,
[1:13:24] consciousness, memory, I can't remember
[1:13:26] the other ones.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Affection. One more
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; imagination.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Imagination. Five of them. So that we
[1:13:33] can contact ourselves and one another.
[1:13:36] But none of those actually declare
[1:13:39] faith.
[1:13:41] Only faith declares faith.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And that's where we have to say that
[1:13:45] faith is a person,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost in our lives.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; But if our senses can contact it, then
[1:13:52] it's just science. I I found that to be
[1:13:55] real fascinating.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] Brother Bradomy says, "Now, here's where
[1:14:00] many people fail to receive their
[1:14:02] healing or what they're asking for
[1:14:06] because they take faith to be something
[1:14:08] that it is not." See,
[1:14:12] and and that's where I said a while ago,
[1:14:14] years ago even, and I think it's really
[1:14:16] important for us to to remember,
[1:14:18] brothers and sisters, is that we cannot
[1:14:21] we need to remember it can be very easy
[1:14:24] to mistake the message of the hour for
[1:14:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; To say that I understand that God sent a
[1:14:33] prophet to the age in which we live. I
[1:14:35] understand there's church age
[1:14:36] messengers. I understand that there's
[1:14:38] gifts in the body. I understand I'm a
[1:14:40] part of the assembly,
[1:14:43] but not go all the way and surrendering
[1:14:45] our lives to allowing him to be Lord in
[1:14:47] our lives like the scripture said that
[1:14:49] we read about tonight. When we do that,
[1:14:51] what happens is we we actually confuse
[1:14:53] the message of the hour with the Holy
[1:14:56] Ghost in our life. And and it's not
[1:14:57] actually going to give us the results
[1:14:59] that we're looking for. But brother
[1:15:01] Bradomy says, "Now, here's where many
[1:15:03] people fail to receive their healing or
[1:15:05] what they're asking for because they
[1:15:06] take faith to be something that it is
[1:15:09] not." See, it's not an emotion.
[1:15:12] They don't believe it. It's it's not
[1:15:15] imagination.
[1:15:16] It's not imagination. It's not an
[1:15:18] emotion. It's not a sense. It's not a
[1:15:20] feeling that we get. It's not something
[1:15:23] that we can tangibly relate to.
[1:15:26] The only way that we can tangibly relate
[1:15:29] to faith is by the word of God.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; That's the only way we can tangibly
[1:15:35] relate to faith. And you know, brothers
[1:15:37] and sisters, that's why the prophet said
[1:15:40] the only true evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:43] in our lives is to be able to say amen
[1:15:46] to the word for our day.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; To say that I've got a teaching from a
[1:15:52] seminary. I've got some sort of
[1:15:54] tradition or something something
[1:15:55] something other than what the prophet
[1:15:58] taught is going to not actually lead us
[1:16:00] in the right direction.
[1:16:03] But I think this is just a notable quote
[1:16:05] here. He says, "Now, here's where people
[1:16:07] fail to receive their healing or what
[1:16:10] they're asking for. I say, Lord, help us
[1:16:13] to receive what we need for healing.
[1:16:15] Help us to receive what we're asking
[1:16:18] for." Because they take faith to be
[1:16:20] something that it's not. See, now
[1:16:22] remember, Brother Brandham said earlier
[1:16:23] in this message that faith is based on
[1:16:26] something.
[1:16:27] It's based on forgiveness.
[1:16:30] And if the devil can get us to keep
[1:16:32] something in our life that's just not
[1:16:34] forgiven, guess what? Our faith is
[1:16:37] paralyzed.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; We've got faith maybe, but it's not what
[1:16:42] it should be.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; It's a growth that's stunted in our
[1:16:46] lives. And I I just want you to know my
[1:16:49] heart tonight. I'm not trying to to
[1:16:51] throw off on us. I'm not trying to scold
[1:16:53] us. What I'm trying to do IS KICK THE
[1:16:55] DEVIL OUT OF us
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; because the devil's going to try and
[1:16:59] maintain a stronghold in our life and
[1:17:02] say, "You don't know how bad I've been
[1:17:04] hurt. It doesn't matter how bad we've
[1:17:06] been hurt. There's forgiveness for it."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; And I think that faith will actually
[1:17:15] take that hurt away.
[1:17:17] We we have the ability to have freedom
[1:17:19] and liberty from the hurts in our lives.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; We've all suffered hurts
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; in varying degrees. And like I said,
[1:17:26] sometimes the hurts can never ever be
[1:17:28] fixed. Never. Naturally speaking, we
[1:17:31] could go to to years of counseling and a
[1:17:34] a a human counselor is never going to
[1:17:36] fix us. Never. They'll tell us how to
[1:17:40] cope with it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But there is one that will fix us. Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; The one that will fix us will teach us
[1:17:46] to actually take it ourselves
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; and not put it in our sea of
[1:17:51] forgetfulness, but give it to him and
[1:17:53] let him put it in his sea of
[1:17:55] forgetfulness. And guess what happens
[1:17:57] when that happens, brothers and sisters?
[1:17:59] It starts to leave our imagination and
[1:18:02] our memory. It starts to fade away. And
[1:18:05] the devil's going to come back. We've
[1:18:06] talked about it in the past many times.
[1:18:07] The devil's going to come and shake that
[1:18:09] jar of memories and say, "Don't you
[1:18:10] remember what this person did TO YOU?
[1:18:12] HOW HOW HURT YOU ARE, how how terrible
[1:18:14] it was in your life, and you can say,
[1:18:16] "No, it's dealt with. No, I know I put
[1:18:18] it under the blood." How do I know?
[1:18:20] Because I've forgiven that person, and I
[1:18:22] don't have auntu against that person
[1:18:24] anymore. When I think about them, I
[1:18:26] don't have that oy feeling that comes up
[1:18:29] or used to. Anyways, something new has
[1:18:31] taken place. And that truly is faith.
[1:18:34] That truly is the person of Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ.
[1:18:39] So, I just want to encourage us if we've
[1:18:41] got anything that's that's maybe not
[1:18:43] dealt with, anything that's maybe not
[1:18:44] forgiven, let's just examine our lives
[1:18:47] and find that forgiveness. Let him find
[1:18:49] that forgiveness for us. Let him search
[1:18:52] us and try us and bring that out of our
[1:18:54] lives. He'll take it out of our lives.
[1:18:56] And I can tell you by experience,
[1:18:58] brothers and sisters, if we're willing
[1:19:00] to give it to him, if we're willing to
[1:19:01] surren, if we're willing to take him at
[1:19:03] his word and just go to that person and
[1:19:05] submit ourselves one to another in the
[1:19:07] fear of God, even if that other person
[1:19:08] has nothing to do with it, if they won't
[1:19:10] accept it, if they completely reject it,
[1:19:12] we can stand before God and say, "Lord,
[1:19:14] I took you at your word. Your word said
[1:19:16] to do that, and I went and did that, and
[1:19:18] they wouldn't recognize your word, but I
[1:19:20] know you do."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. guarantee you he will come on your
[1:19:24] scene maybe in a greater way than he
[1:19:26] would with people on both ends. But when
[1:19:28] you're dealing with believers, he's
[1:19:30] going to work on both ends. He's not
[1:19:31] just going to leave one person out to
[1:19:32] dry. It doesn't work that way. That's
[1:19:35] the self-same spirit that we're talking
[1:19:37] about tonight.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we have the prophet saying in the
[1:19:40] next quote here, he says, "Now listen
[1:19:41] close. See, it's not what you imagine.
[1:19:44] Faith is not what you imagine." Remember
[1:19:47] I said if you want a a fun exercise just
[1:19:50] type in faith is not in the message and
[1:19:53] see what the hits are. Listen close. He
[1:19:56] says see it's not what you imagine. It's
[1:20:00] just as real to you as any sense of your
[1:20:04] body will declare anything else.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Now it sounds almost contradictory. It
[1:20:10] almost sounds confusing because wait a
[1:20:13] second how are we supposed to understand
[1:20:15] this? The prophet explains it in this
[1:20:18] message. If we just take the time to
[1:20:20] listen, he says, "Listen close." It's
[1:20:22] not what we imagine. It's not our
[1:20:24] imagination. It's maybe not what we
[1:20:26] think. And that's what I want to
[1:20:28] encourage us to tonight, brothers and
[1:20:30] sisters. It's the person of Jesus
[1:20:31] Christ,
[1:20:33] the Holy Ghost in our lives. It's just
[1:20:35] as real to you. And I'll say it this
[1:20:37] way. He is just as real to you as any
[1:20:41] sense of your body will declare anything
[1:20:43] else.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just as real as my eyes says.
[1:20:48] This is a piece of paper.
[1:20:52] Faith. It's just as real as my eyes says
[1:20:55] it and my my fingers feel it and and I
[1:20:58] can hear it with my ears,
[1:21:01] but it's not like our senses. It sounds
[1:21:04] very confusing. what I what I believe
[1:21:06] he's saying. I'm not going to say this
[1:21:08] is what he means, but my understanding
[1:21:10] of it is it becomes that completely real
[1:21:13] to us.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's why we've come
[1:21:16] tonight because nobody could have talked
[1:21:18] us. Uh oh, don't go to church tonight.
[1:21:21] Don't bother wasting your time driving
[1:21:22] across the city burning your gas. You
[1:21:25] could just stay home by a nice warm
[1:21:26] fire, have a cup of coffee or or cocoa
[1:21:29] by the fire and just just be nice and
[1:21:32] warm and comfortable in your chair. You
[1:21:34] don't have to do that. Nobody's going to
[1:21:35] talk you OUT OF IT. WHY NOT?
[1:21:38] Because of faith.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; There's faith inside of us. And we can't
[1:21:43] explain it. We can't I can't dig in my
[1:21:45] pocket and pull out my faith and show
[1:21:47] you my faith. But I can show you my
[1:21:50] works.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And by my works, you're going to see my
[1:21:55] faith.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so interesting
[1:21:59] in our lives. You know, many times
[1:22:01] people say they believe, but their works
[1:22:03] actually betray them. Yes.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Now listen close. See, it's not what you
[1:22:08] imagine. It's just as real to you as any
[1:22:11] sense of your body will declare anything
[1:22:13] else. It's just as real as my eye says.
[1:22:16] This is a piece of paper. Just as real
[1:22:18] as to say that is a light. It's just as
[1:22:22] real as to say I feel my coat. Just as
[1:22:25] real as I hear that baby talking there
[1:22:28] or making its noise. See, just that real
[1:22:33] as music playing. It's just as real as I
[1:22:37] taste anything in my mouth. It's that
[1:22:39] real. Only you can't show it to somebody
[1:22:42] else.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; You have it alone.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's yours.
[1:22:50] And that's the way it is, brothers and
[1:22:51] sisters. It's a paradox.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; It's completely against reason. It's
[1:22:57] completely unexplainable. But yet it's
[1:22:59] 100% true in our lives.
[1:23:02] But I think in our teaching tonight, I
[1:23:04] just want to get that I want to get that
[1:23:06] underlined and underpinned in our lives.
[1:23:08] If we want to see faith according to the
[1:23:10] word of God, then we've got to be
[1:23:12] willing to forgive.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; If we're not, then I don't believe we
[1:23:18] have real faith according to the word.
[1:23:22] He says, "You have it alone." Amen. It's
[1:23:24] yours. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that faith is a
[1:23:30] revelation
[1:23:32] and revelations come from God. We heard
[1:23:34] it so good on this on on Sunday. I
[1:23:36] believe it was Cain and Abel.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; The revelation that Cain had and the
[1:23:41] revelation that Abel had. Cain never had
[1:23:44] the revelation that Abel had.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; So beautiful that it was blood. But even
[1:23:51] God, the God that we serve, the same
[1:23:54] God, he's so kind and long-suffering,
[1:23:57] would come and say to Cain, "If you
[1:24:00] would just do like your brother,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; But he didn't have faith. He didn't have
[1:24:07] anything in his heart to mix with that
[1:24:08] word when it came from God
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; to do anything about it. In fact, what
[1:24:13] happened was it actually brought out his
[1:24:15] true colors and demonstrated who his
[1:24:17] father was.
[1:24:19] Brother Brandham says it's that real
[1:24:21] only. You can't show it to somebody
[1:24:23] else. You have it alone. Amen. It's
[1:24:25] yours. Faith is not is faith is the
[1:24:29] substance. See, not just a myth. So many
[1:24:32] people come. He says, "Now these are
[1:24:34] real deep lessons.
[1:24:37] These are real deep lessons. And I'll
[1:24:40] catch the top of it,
[1:24:43] then you dig down into it."
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I love the way he says this. So it's and
[1:24:49] and who's he saying that to? I would say
[1:24:51] this. Anyone that hears his voice,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; anyone that listens to this tape.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; It's not just up to the ministers. It's
[1:24:58] not just up to the deacons. It's not the
[1:24:59] song leaders. It's anybody. These are
[1:25:02] real deep lessons. And I catch the top
[1:25:05] of it than you dig down into it. See, I
[1:25:09] think it's just amazing to think that
[1:25:11] there's more for us to dig down into.
[1:25:13] Isn't there? Isn't that amazing to think
[1:25:14] about? There's more for us to dig down
[1:25:17] into.
[1:25:20] Verse 26 of Mark 11. But if ye do not
[1:25:24] forgive,
[1:25:26] neither will your father which is in
[1:25:27] heaven forgive your trespasses.
[1:25:32] Amazing scripture to think about because
[1:25:35] we know that there's a book of records.
[1:25:37] There's a book of records that's taken
[1:25:39] place. And uh the book that we are in, I
[1:25:44] want to encourage us tonight to
[1:25:45] recognize our book is the book of the
[1:25:49] life of the lamb that was slain before
[1:25:52] the foundation of the world.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And our names were put in there before
[1:25:56] the foundation of the world.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And there is a book of record that's
[1:26:01] being written by everybody's life. But
[1:26:03] when it comes to the rapture of the
[1:26:05] church, those ones with perfect, mature,
[1:26:08] complete faith, that that book of
[1:26:10] records,
[1:26:12] it just disappears
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; because we transform into a brand new
[1:26:16] body. We transform into a brand new
[1:26:19] realm. We move into that theophony body
[1:26:22] that Christ gave us that he made for us
[1:26:25] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:26:27] character that he has worked out in our
[1:26:29] lives, molding it to perfect faith,
[1:26:32] which puts us in the rapture condition
[1:26:35] gives us the ability to no longer need
[1:26:37] to look at a judgment scale on earth.
[1:26:40] There's no name written in a book of the
[1:26:42] works.
[1:26:44] The book of life is not pertaining to
[1:26:47] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:49] Brother goes on to say in this message,
[1:26:51] notice it's something that you possess.
[1:26:55] It's actually a possession of ours. It's
[1:26:58] a revelation. This faith is a revelation
[1:27:01] of a person in our lives. And and he
[1:27:04] says, notice it's something that you
[1:27:06] possess, not imagination. If you really
[1:27:09] have it, it's just as real to you as any
[1:27:11] other thing that could be. And I want to
[1:27:14] encourage us tonight to celebrate this,
[1:27:16] brothers and sisters. If we have this
[1:27:19] faith in our lives, there's something
[1:27:21] that constrains us to come to church.
[1:27:23] There's something that constrains us to
[1:27:25] pray for one another. There's something
[1:27:26] that constrains us to want to get
[1:27:28] together and worship the King of Kings.
[1:27:30] That is faith. And it's not something
[1:27:33] that's an imagination if you really have
[1:27:35] it. It's just as real to you as any
[1:27:38] other thing could be. And that's why
[1:27:40] it's so beautiful. There ain't nobody
[1:27:42] that's ever going to be able to talk a
[1:27:43] true believer out of the message of the
[1:27:46] hour.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; They're going to say, "Well, you know,
[1:27:49] you're a heretic the way that you
[1:27:50] worship. you don't believe in the
[1:27:52] trinitarian spirit. And we'll say,
[1:27:54] "Yeah, that's exactly right." Just like
[1:27:57] Paul said, the way that you call heresy,
[1:28:00] that's how I worship the King of Kings
[1:28:02] and Lord of Lords because I've got
[1:28:04] faith. And without faith, it's
[1:28:06] impossible to please God.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It's something that you possess. It's
[1:28:12] not imagination if you really have it.
[1:28:15] It's just as real to you as any other
[1:28:18] thing that could be. just as real as you
[1:28:22] know that you're riding in your
[1:28:24] automobile. And I remember hearing it
[1:28:27] said many times when I was a young
[1:28:28] Christian coming to the message church.
[1:28:30] It's like turning the key over in your
[1:28:32] car. We have to have a certain level of
[1:28:34] faith, don't we? To believe that it's
[1:28:36] going to start.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes with some vehicles, we have to
[1:28:40] have just a little more faith. We have
[1:28:42] to have just a little more prayer. M
[1:28:45] maybe trust the Lord a little bit more.
[1:28:47] But other times we just come out groggy
[1:28:49] in the morning and it's cold and dark
[1:28:51] and we just turn the key and it starts
[1:28:53] and we drive away. That's faith.
[1:28:58] It's just as real as you know that
[1:29:00] you're sitting in the church.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Just as real as you know that you're
[1:29:06] sitting in the church.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Just as real as we know that we're here
[1:29:09] tonight.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's what faith is. There's no way
[1:29:13] that we could ever really do it justice
[1:29:15] trying to explain what faith is. I know
[1:29:17] it, but I think it's so good. I just
[1:29:19] want to say it this way. If somebody
[1:29:20] asked me, "What's faith in in in the
[1:29:22] Bible?" One of the gifts of faith in in
[1:29:24] First Corinthians there, I would simply
[1:29:26] say this. It's being able to believe the
[1:29:29] word.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; It's being able to believe the word and
[1:29:32] saying, "Be it unto me." Just like Mary
[1:29:33] did to the angel messenger, "Be it unto
[1:29:35] me according to thy word." If there's a
[1:29:37] word for this age, I want it. I want it
[1:29:40] all because it's going to do something
[1:29:41] for me. That's what faith is. That is a
[1:29:44] summary from brother Barry about what
[1:29:46] faith is. But brother Brandham says just
[1:29:47] as real as you know that you're setting
[1:29:48] in the church. Just as real as you hear
[1:29:51] my voice, it is a substance, not an
[1:29:55] imagination, not an emotion, but
[1:29:58] something that you have. And it comes to
[1:30:00] you by hearing the word of God.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; And that only.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It doesn't come by a faith
[1:30:09] seminar. It doesn't come by a faith
[1:30:12] retreat.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't come by counseling. It
[1:30:18] doesn't come by doing things other than
[1:30:21] what the word says. It only comes by
[1:30:23] hearing the word of God.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And that only
[1:30:28] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:30:31] word of God.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] That puts it back to where your faith
[1:30:37] then
[1:30:39] is not in some individual.
[1:30:44] This is where it gets tight. This is
[1:30:45] where it really gets deep. I'm glo
[1:30:48] glossing over this stuff. But it's
[1:30:50] really important, brothers and sisters.
[1:30:52] We can get caught up with believing in
[1:30:53] the gifts and saying that there's a
[1:30:55] specific brother somewhere and if he
[1:30:57] prays for me, then I know I'm going to
[1:30:59] get my healing because he's got a gift
[1:31:00] of healing. And outside of that, I don't
[1:31:02] know, man.
[1:31:03] If we do that, what we do is we take
[1:31:05] away the faith that we have in our lives
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; and we're putting it in an individual
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; because it's not the individual that
[1:31:13] does the healing, is it?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Is it?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's some great evangelists
[1:31:18] and they've got some great gifts, but
[1:31:20] who does the healing?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; It's God.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It's only God. It's only ever been God.
[1:31:26] Even with William Brandham, WHO DID THE
[1:31:28] HEALING?
[1:31:30] HE ALWAYS SAID ON THE STAGE,
[1:31:34] now don't worry.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; You feel that presence, don't you?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Right? He would say that because the
[1:31:40] angel of the Lord himself
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; descended with a SHOUT AND STOOD BESIDE
[1:31:46] HIM RIGHT THERE on stage
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; to back up his word.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Because he had faith.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:31:57] word of God. That puts it back to where
[1:31:59] your faith then is not in some
[1:32:03] individual.
[1:32:05] It's not in a man. Brothers and sisters,
[1:32:08] if you put your faith in a man, what
[1:32:11] will happen is God will allow that man
[1:32:14] to fall
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; because he will not share his glory with
[1:32:20] anyone. Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's that's what's h it's totally
[1:32:24] what's going to happen if we wind up
[1:32:26] putting all of our faith in a man.
[1:32:28] That's what will happen. Don't put your
[1:32:29] faith in Brother Barry, please. I I
[1:32:31] [laughter] have a hard enough time as it
[1:32:33] is.
[1:32:35] But that's the way it works. That's how
[1:32:36] it is. Faith cometh by hearing. Hearing
[1:32:38] the word of God. That puts it back to
[1:32:40] where your faith then is not in some
[1:32:43] individual.
[1:32:47] And that's what we want to see. That's
[1:32:48] what I want to see is for us to have
[1:32:50] robust faith.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; The kind of faith that puts hair on your
[1:32:54] chest. Brother Brandham said the kind of
[1:32:57] faith that actually devils are afraid of
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; where they recognize there's something
[1:33:03] different. We know that. We heard it on
[1:33:05] Sunday. So good. So good. 12 legions of
[1:33:08] devils recognized the spirit that was
[1:33:11] inside Jesus that was backing up Jesus.
[1:33:15] All of the religious folks in the day
[1:33:16] couldn't though, could they? They called
[1:33:20] him Beelzebub.
[1:33:21] They said he was a devil himself.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; But all the devils, they knew exactly
[1:33:26] who he was.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And I think it's exactly the same way
[1:33:31] with a believer. They don't want nothing
[1:33:34] to do with a true believer. Listen to
[1:33:36] adoption. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:33:38] it in there. He says it very clearly.
[1:33:41] The devil won't want nothing to do with
[1:33:42] you if you truly are an adopted son or
[1:33:45] daughter of God. If you've truly been
[1:33:47] filled and sealed with his Holy Ghost,
[1:33:49] he's taken us out and shown to all the
[1:33:52] world, even the devils, this is my
[1:33:54] beloved son. My spirit is in him and my
[1:33:56] seal is set upon him and nobody will be
[1:33:59] able to change that.
[1:34:01] He says that puts it back to where your
[1:34:03] faith then is not in some individual.
[1:34:05] It's not in a man
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; and it's not in an organization.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; We can't say because I belong to the
[1:34:13] message of the hour because I believe in
[1:34:16] the message of the hour that I'm saved.
[1:34:19] If we are a part of the message of the
[1:34:21] hour and we do believe the message of
[1:34:23] the hour, then we'll do what the message
[1:34:26] of the hour said,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; we'll actually go on to the full baptism
[1:34:30] of the Holy Ghost in our lives. Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; We will become sons and daughters, fully
[1:34:36] adopted sons and daughters of God.
[1:34:39] That's what he's calling for in the age
[1:34:41] in which we live. That's what the
[1:34:42] message is for. To turn the hearts of
[1:34:45] the children back to the
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; faith of the Pentecostal fathers,
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; not to just say that I'm a part of an
[1:34:54] organization, so it's all good. No,
[1:34:57] we've got some questions for questions
[1:34:59] and answers. And it's very specifically
[1:35:01] about what I just mentioned about going
[1:35:03] on to be fully adopted sons and
[1:35:05] daughters of God about getting the true
[1:35:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost. About
[1:35:07] recognizing where we are and and how
[1:35:11] it's not an organization. It's not in a
[1:35:14] group of people. It's in God. That's why
[1:35:17] I think the message is so good. Don't
[1:35:19] you think the message is so wonderful?
[1:35:20] The message that God gave to this age
[1:35:22] through the vindicated prophet, if we
[1:35:24] would just listen to the words, all he
[1:35:26] ever does is puts it back on God. Amen.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He does not say, "Look at me." In fact,
[1:35:31] when the deity spirit came around before
[1:35:33] the seals were open in 1962 and tried to
[1:35:37] actually get brother Brandham to get on
[1:35:39] board with them baptizing in his name,
[1:35:41] he said, "You make me an antichrist,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take myself off of the
[1:35:46] field until you make that right."
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But there's still people, there's still
[1:35:53] deity spirit swirling around the world.
[1:35:55] There's still people that baptize in the
[1:35:57] name of Brandom, Christ Branham. There's
[1:36:00] still people that do that. There's still
[1:36:01] people that pray in in in the name of
[1:36:05] Rosco. There's still people that are are
[1:36:07] are doing things that are completely
[1:36:08] outside of what the message of the hour
[1:36:10] said. If we truly believe the message of
[1:36:12] the hour, then we'll go all the way into
[1:36:14] Christ.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; We'll say amen to the entirety of the
[1:36:18] word. But I just love that about the
[1:36:19] message, how he always points back to
[1:36:21] God. He says it's not in a group of
[1:36:23] people, it's in God. because God is the
[1:36:26] word. See,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; your faith in is God.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful. It's it's
[1:36:32] such a a hallmark
[1:36:35] thing that we can see in our lives. If
[1:36:36] you ever wonder if you're right, just
[1:36:38] talk to a trinitarian about the baptism
[1:36:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:43] Just have that conversation and and see
[1:36:45] the reaction that you get.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. It's a spiritual battle.
[1:36:49] It's not human. When you get the
[1:36:52] reaction you get, I mean, I'm sorry that
[1:36:55] you get that reaction, but that spirit
[1:36:58] doesn't like it because that spirit
[1:37:00] knows that if the person could get the
[1:37:02] true revelation about the two spirits
[1:37:04] working within the framework of the
[1:37:05] Christian church, what will happen?
[1:37:07] Satan will be powerless before her.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; If if she could get the true baptism of
[1:37:13] the Holy Ghost, Satan will be powerless
[1:37:15] before her. Last quote tonight as we
[1:37:17] close, I'll call the musicians. He says,
[1:37:19] "Now we see at first the disciples
[1:37:22] didn't have this perfect faith. They
[1:37:25] didn't have it because they'd had Christ
[1:37:28] walking with him." You know, I I didn't
[1:37:30] even get into the scripture that I
[1:37:32] wanted to bring tonight for this. I
[1:37:34] apologize.
[1:37:36] It's Matthew 17. And I don't want to try
[1:37:39] and keep us late. I'm just going to read
[1:37:40] this quote, but I I want to encourage us
[1:37:43] maybe go and read Matthew 17 and just
[1:37:44] see what what what what Brother Brandham
[1:37:47] is talking about here. He says, "Now we
[1:37:48] see at first the disciples didn't have
[1:37:50] this perfect faith.
[1:37:52] They didn't have it cuz they'd had
[1:37:55] Christ walking with him. But then
[1:37:57] afterwards, Christ was in them." And so,
[1:38:00] you see, it's hard then to have this
[1:38:02] perfect faith without
[1:38:05] the Holy Spirit.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; It has to bring it.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Barry harps about it
[1:38:14] because it's the only thing.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Without the Holy Ghost in
[1:38:18] our lives, we're going to tribulation. I
[1:38:21] promise.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Tribulation without the Holy Ghost
[1:38:25] because we already have the mark of the
[1:38:27] beast. We have Cain's DNA
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; through the fall. That's our life. To
[1:38:32] resist the Holy Ghost, Brother Brandham
[1:38:34] said, is to accept the mark of the
[1:38:35] beast. It's already in us. We don't have
[1:38:37] to look for it. And so, you see, it's
[1:38:40] hard then to have this perfect faith
[1:38:42] without the Holy Spirit. It has to bring
[1:38:45] it. It does. Now, you say the disciples
[1:38:47] didn't have perfect faith. Nope.
[1:38:52] For they had an epileptic child there.
[1:38:54] Remember the scripture I mentioned? They
[1:38:56] had an epileptic child there that they
[1:38:58] were trying to cast this devil out of
[1:39:00] him and they couldn't do it. And the
[1:39:01] father seen Jesus coming and he said,
[1:39:03] "We've brought my son to your disciples
[1:39:06] and and they could not cure him." See,
[1:39:08] can you imagine how the disciples must
[1:39:10] have felt?
[1:39:12] And afterwards the disciples asked Jesus
[1:39:14] saying why could we not cure him. And
[1:39:18] Jesus said because of the lack of faith
[1:39:22] or your unbelief. That's right. Because
[1:39:26] of your unbelief. Now remember they had
[1:39:28] power. This is where I think it gets so
[1:39:31] tricky. This is where it gets real
[1:39:34] tricky. We need to understand what this
[1:39:36] means. Remember they had power. Jesus
[1:39:39] had given them power to heal the sick,
[1:39:41] raise the dead, cast out devils just a
[1:39:44] few days before that. They had the
[1:39:47] power, but not the faith to use the
[1:39:50] power.
[1:39:55] Now, there's the Bradom Tabernacle. He
[1:39:58] says, "Wow, his church, there's the
[1:40:01] Brandom Tabernacle. They had the power,
[1:40:03] but maybe not the faith to use the
[1:40:05] power."
[1:40:07] And that's what I want to encourage us
[1:40:09] tonight, brothers and sisters. If we're
[1:40:10] going to see these gifts, we've got to
[1:40:13] have the faith to use those gifts.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; The disciples had power.
[1:40:22] They had power, but not the faith to use
[1:40:24] the power. Now, there's the Brandham
[1:40:25] tabernacle. There's the church. There's
[1:40:27] the bride. Today,
[1:40:30] the Holy Spirit is here with power, but
[1:40:33] you haven't got that faith to move it.
[1:40:36] See what I mean? It takes faith to move
[1:40:38] it. In Matthew 17, if you want to check
[1:40:42] it out, go home and read it. You can see
[1:40:45] Jesus said, "You know what? After he did
[1:40:47] it, he just spoke the word. Jesus just
[1:40:48] spoke the [music] word and the spirit
[1:40:51] left." We know the kid went into one
[1:40:53] last fit. [music] But the spirit left
[1:40:56] that epileptic spirit. Today, we want to
[1:40:59] treat it with drugs and and therapy and
[1:41:01] all manner of different things, diet,
[1:41:03] all these things. we want to treat
[1:41:05] epilepsy with. But in the Bible, Jesus
[1:41:08] treated it. Dr. Jesus treated it just
[1:41:11] with his word.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:41:14] forever, brothers and sisters.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Let's not let science get in the way of
[1:41:19] the word.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Because it can very quickly, very easily
[1:41:22] get in the way of our faith. We need to
[1:41:25] have perfect faith. The faith that will
[1:41:27] change our bodies. Jesus said in here, I
[1:41:30] could even get into I could probably
[1:41:31] take another two services on this,
[1:41:32] brothers [music] and sisters. this part
[1:41:34] when we want to see that level of faith.
[1:41:36] Guess what? It's going to take effort.
[1:41:38] It's not just going to feather fall out
[1:41:40] of heaven into our laps because how did
[1:41:43] Jesus say at the end of this scripture?
[1:41:44] He said, "This kind only goes
[1:41:48] by fasting and prayer." [music]
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; So when our lives are too busy for
[1:41:53] prayer and too busy for fasting and too
[1:41:55] busy for fasting and prayer, guess what?
[1:41:58] Those devils are going to have a place
[1:42:00] in our lives.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; But if we want to see them go, they will
[1:42:03] go. They have to go. We've seen the
[1:42:05] formula. We've been given the formula.
[1:42:06] Read Matthew chapter 17. I want to
[1:42:09] encourage us to have faith
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; and don't doubt. If we don't understand
[1:42:14] it, don't don't worry. We don't have to
[1:42:17] understand it. We just have to believe
[1:42:18] it. That's our commission. Just just
[1:42:20] believe [music] and all things are
[1:42:22] possible.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And God will do the rest. He'll reveal
[1:42:26] it to us. If we've got a burning
[1:42:28] question, all we've got to do is ask
[1:42:30] him. And I promise you, he will answer
[1:42:32] it. He'll answer it maybe through a
[1:42:33] minister. He'll answer it maybe through
[1:42:35] listening to a tape. He'll answer it
[1:42:36] maybe through a revelation, maybe a
[1:42:38] dream, maybe someone in the world, maybe
[1:42:40] somehow. Remember, he's God. Don't put
[1:42:43] him in a box and say, "It's got to be a
[1:42:44] certain way." If we ask him a question
[1:42:47] and just allow him to answer it, he will
[1:42:49] always answer.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Always. [music]
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight.
[1:42:57] Remember, we're looking for perfect
[1:42:58] [music] faith.
[1:43:00] Brother Brandham preached that in 1963.
[1:43:04] Let's just [music] pray. Heavenly
[1:43:06] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:43:08] your word. Thank you, Lord, for sending
[1:43:10] us a vindicated [music] prophet
[1:43:12] in the age in which we live, Lord, to
[1:43:14] know that there is a way, Father, even
[1:43:19] though there's so much error in this
[1:43:20] world, we don't look at ourselves and
[1:43:24] pat ourselves on the back and think that
[1:43:26] we're anything, Lord. We know that we
[1:43:28] are just like the publican that was
[1:43:31] praying in the temple that day. And the
[1:43:34] only thing we can do is hang our heads
[1:43:37] and say, "Lord, forgive me because I'm a
[1:43:39] sinner.
[1:43:42] Every single day of my life, it seems
[1:43:45] [music] I do something wrong. It seems
[1:43:47] that I fail." But we know our desire
[1:43:52] is to succeed. Our desire is to serve
[1:43:54] you according to your word. And we know
[1:43:57] that that desire is what will take us
[1:43:59] through.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; So, Father, tonight, if there's any one
[1:44:03] of us here tonight, Lord, that has
[1:44:05] something in our lives that maybe is
[1:44:07] left undone or that we have never dealt
[1:44:10] with because it hurts [music] too much.
[1:44:12] Father, I pray that you would give us
[1:44:14] strength in the name of Jesus to deal
[1:44:17] with that hurt, Lord, to deal with that
[1:44:20] that scar, Father, that problem that
[1:44:23] could hold us back. And father, maybe
[1:44:26] it's not holding us back, but the devil
[1:44:28] likes to try and make us think that
[1:44:30] perhaps it's not dealt with properly.
[1:44:32] And sometimes we just need to drive down
[1:44:35] a stake. We need to go back into that
[1:44:37] place and look at [music] it and drive
[1:44:39] down a stake and say, "From this time
[1:44:41] forwards, this will have no power over
[1:44:44] me as long as I live."
[1:44:47] And we know, Father, that you will
[1:44:49] always come on the scene when you're
[1:44:50] invited.
[1:44:52] We just got to be willing to go inside
[1:44:55] that secret place in our lives that we
[1:44:57] never want to look at and invite you to
[1:45:00] come come with us and and examine it and
[1:45:04] heal us. Father, we just want to commit
[1:45:07] each one into your hands tonight.
[1:45:09] Father, you know the reason we we
[1:45:10] ministered on this tonight. I don't, but
[1:45:13] I know you do. And Father, I pray that
[1:45:16] Lord, the word would just find its mark
[1:45:18] in the heart of your children.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray, Father, that you would
[1:45:22] help me as well, Father. Let me have
[1:45:24] nothing. Oh Lord, I don't claim to be
[1:45:26] anybody, Father. I know I'm nobody. Oh,
[1:45:29] Father, but I know somebody and I know
[1:45:32] you, Lord. And I just thank you for what
[1:45:34] you've done for each and every one of us
[1:45:35] tonight.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would keep your
[1:45:38] hand upon those who aren't here tonight,
[1:45:40] Father. Some at work, some traveling.
[1:45:42] Oh, Father, some at home, maybe not
[1:45:44] feeling well. I pray that, Lord, they're
[1:45:46] feeling better now than they were at the
[1:45:48] beginning of this service, Lord. And
[1:45:50] father, I pray that when they wake up
[1:45:52] tomorrow, they would just have sweet
[1:45:53] rest tonight. That they would feel even
[1:45:55] better tomorrow. In the name of Jesus,
[1:45:58] we ask it. Lord, your word said that
[1:46:00] whatever we ask, we shall have it. So
[1:46:02] tonight, [music] we just declare it in
[1:46:04] the name of Jesus as a body for each and
[1:46:06] everyone who's not feeling well tonight.
[1:46:09] Father, we love you and we thank you,
[1:46:11] Lord. [music] We pray that you would
[1:46:12] just keep your hand upon us now as we
[1:46:14] travel home. Lord, keep us safe on the
[1:46:16] roads. If it's your will for us to
[1:46:18] gather again on Sunday, Lord, we will
[1:46:20] gladly come and worship you in spirit
[1:46:23] and in truth.
[1:46:25] We love you and we thank you. We ask all
[1:46:27] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:46:30] pray.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:46:34] Amen. Could we sing 902?
[1:46:37] I worship you,
