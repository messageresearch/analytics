53. Ye are the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; James 4:10, "Humble thyself in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up." &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 5:16 to18. Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. &gt;&gt; First Corinians 13:13. And now abideth faith, hope, and charity. These three, but the greatest of these is charity. &gt;&gt; Matthew 10:40. He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 31. For high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. Walking with Jesus, walking every day all along the way. For I am walking with Jesus, walking with Jesus alone. Walking in the sunlight, walking in the shadow, walking every day all along the way. For I am walking in the sunlight. Walking in the shadow. Walking with Jesus alone. Walking in the sunlight. Walking in the shadow. Walking every day all along the way. For I am walking with walking in the shadow. Walking with Jesus alone. Walking in the sunlight, walking in the shadow, walking every day all along the way. For I am walking in the sunlight, walking in the shadow, walking with Jesus follow. Jesus the little children. All the children of the world, brown, yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world. Jesus loves the little children. All the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world.
