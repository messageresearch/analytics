with no success until at some point he looked at her and said the woman kept saying what shall I do what shall I do and he replied and said you cannot do better than to Take It All to Jesus you must tell Jesus and for a moment he said she seemed abstracted in meditation and then her face glowed our eyes lighted up and with a huge animation she exclaimed yes I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus and

able to finish this message tonight because I don't want you you to stay to keep you long I will finish it on December 3 is that okay thank you so uh just a little bit uh background uh I've been in the in the field of missionary work for 40 years now and the Lord has been good I was able to build churches for him and raise up ministers uh that they are now pastoring the church also and I intend to do the missionary program uh as long as I live so when I go back from here I'll go I'll go to to Taiwan and some Asian countries to uh start a work for the Lord there because I have contacts in those Church in those countries where they are interested to start a new work for the Lord's Soul remember me in prayer because that's uh we intend to do uh as we wait for the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen so let us now uh begin so uh in Jos what chapter 5:2 and the Mana ceased on the morning after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year so it's a clear right that the Mana stopped the moment Israel the Israelites arrived in the Pro Promised Land what does this mean to the Believers the prophet said in his message entitled adoption 1960 and when they crossed over into the land the Mana ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they atat the old corn of the land now now that you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the sincere milk of the Gospel that you don't have to be babed and patted and persuaded to come to church yes sir now that you are real fully matured Christians you're ready to eat strong Meats now yes sir you're ready to come into something Hallelujah he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and Rich yes sir all will'll get into it D directly and oh it's been hidden since the foundation of the world amen he said now that you've come into this I'm addressing this to you not to those who just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land amen amen hallelujah that has received the promise how many receed the promise of the Holy Ghost oh aren't you glad that you are in the land over here now eating the old corn eating the strong things of God and got a clear understanding amen amen praise the Lord your spiritual mind is all unmodded up you you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is yes sir you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know in whom you have believe and persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against that day that should be the word of God what is the chronological order of the prophet's teachings regarding Church ages seals trumpets and vials an exposition of the seven Church ages the prophet said this for out of the church ages out of the ages came the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets yes sir and out of the trumpets come the vials and the I think our pastor read this from the introduction of the seven Church ages amen amen now let's take the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals first the prophet of God that the seven Church ages and the sales goes together right amen for a period of how many years 2,000 years amen amen amen what are the seven Church ages Ephesians isira pergamos chatia Sardis Philadelphia and La amen amen and what are the Seven Seals the White Horse the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse Souls under the altar the Great Tribulation and the half hour of silence is that right amen the prophet of God said that the Seven Seals was loosed and was manifested in the seven Church ages amen do you believe that message entitled in the question and answer 1964 now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals being loosed yes sir see the Seven Seals it's manifested what takes place what has took place the seven Church age we are at the end of the seven Church age yes when I say the end that doesn't mean it's this very hour this very minute you remember the Bible said back in the times of the Lord Jesus Paul said for the time is at hand do you realize how long that was in God's time that was yesterday my time it's been 2,000 years amen yes sir the seven Church ages they are in Revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3 is that correct and the Seven Seals they are in Revelation chapter 6 and chapter 8 uhhuh that's true amen yes sir and the Seven trumpets and the Seven vials brother Bram said they goes together you say amen amen the seven trumpets is in Revelation 8 9 and 11 the seven vials is found in Revelation chapter 16 in the message entitled a thinking man's filter 1965 and I'm anxiously waiting for the hour to where we can all congregate in one place and preach on those seven PL flags and seven vials and the trumpets and so forth they all happen right in a cluster you say Amen brothers and sisters amen is that right the seven Trumpets the prophet of God said they are for Israelites yes sir all right and the Seven vials they are for the foolish virgins how many understand that that's why brother Bram said in his teachings that while the seven trumpets are sounding over Israel because God sent his two prophets Revelation 112 and 3 Moses and Elijah and that is the Feast of the trumpets for the children of Israel Byam said okay and these seven vials and these seven trumpets they happened during the Great Tribulation for a period of three and 1 half years is that correct yes brother amen amen sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel listen now in closing the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven vials three woes woman in the sun casting out of the devil or the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation period don't forget it all this things amen take place during this time amen I believe you are able to follow yes sir amen come on brother now some people believes in the seven years Great Tribulation after the Rapture is that right but the prophet does not teach that the prophet teaches that there's only three and one half years Great Tribulation no seven years because this is what the prophet of God said while the seven trumpets are sounding to Israel to call and seal the 144,000 Jews of Revelation chapter 7 is that right 144,000 were sealed sealed there by the two Prophets Ministry of Revelation 11 2 and three Moses and Elijah is that correct while the seven trumpets are sounding for Israel the seven vials of woes are being poured to the foolish virgins who were left behind from the Rapture Hallelujah the Great Tribulation is in Revelation chap 6 12-1 17 which is the six seal is that correct brothers and sisters and the preaching of the two prophets is in Revelation 11 3-13 yes sir it happened the prophet of God said it happened at the same time uhuh three and one half years only not seven years excuse me would like to in the message entitled six seal 1963 then God dealt with the Gentiles till they took out a people for his name as soon as the Gentile church is taken out he taken up the church and when he did excuse the sleeping virgin the bride went up and the church itself was put put into outer Darkness with there sweeping and wailing and nashing of it in the same time the tribulation Falls excuse upon that people and while the tribulation is falling Amen in there comes these two prophets of Revelation 11 to preach the gospel to them yes sir and they preach 1,100 103 score days well that's exactly with 30 days in a month like the real calendar has exactly three and one half years that's Daniel 17th part last part of the 70th week amen so that settles the arguments while there why there is no seven years Great Tribulation according to the prophet amen because the great Revelation to the foolish virgins and the ceiling of the 144,000 Jews they happen at the same time under three and one half years can you say amen amen praise the Lord thank you now let's go on because uh we still have a lot of quotes here to read so we we want to make sure we'll be able to read some of this amen what are the Seven Seals for in the message Revelation chapter 5 part six part one I mean 1961 please bear with me and he took the book and opened the book and loosed the seals thereof he never told what happened to them when we hit them seven cils being opened right down through the Bible watch what took place right in this excuse seven seal book that we enter now hold the whole mystery yes sir of all the Redemption blessings of [Music] God amen amen the Seven Seals holds the Redemption blessings of God for the Believers that's what the Seven Seals are for sir amen it holds the Redemption blessing blessings for each of the seven Church ages yes that has come amen I'm not used to this weather yet so that's why my throat here is you know time to time uh I drink water in the Philippines I'm used to hot weather so no problem some of my uh companions here they already got some PL but I'm still uh alive I'm still uh still not getting any thank God all right everyone of those seals brother Bram said is on Redemption how the church was redeemed and what will be the redeeming those are the meaning of those seals whatam said so this is one thing they might squabble about this in here about what it is but it's the one that divinely interprets it but on the back side here's there's no one can do it it belongs to him and him alone yesen and he's the one that can reveal those seven Mysteries out and watch how every bit of it is own Redemption how the church was redeemed and what will be the redeeming now those seals according to the prophet of God excuse me they hold the names of the predestinated ones that are supposed to be called in each age amen amen and we are now on the seven seal yes we are not anymore on the first seal third or the six the fifth seal does does not belong to us the six seal does not belong to us too amen only two seals belongs to us and this that is the fourth seal the eagle a and the seventh seal yes sir there are two seals allotted to us can you say amen amen praise the Lord amen the fourth seal and the seventh seal those are the two seals that belongs to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir amen amen all right because remember there will be just so many names on that book and when the last name is added that's all of it and yours might complete it amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen when the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne that was the book of redemption and those names was put in there for before the foundation of the world when that last name was called the book The plan everything else was revealed then the Seven Seals was opened by the lamb so in this seal the fourth seal in the seven SE the names of the predestinated before the foundation of the world will be called by this by the opening of these seals and thank God that you are here meaning to say your name yes was written in the L's book of life because the fort and the Seven seal has called you into this Feast brothers and sisters blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen hallelujah praise and thank God that's why Apostle Paul can say to the Believers in his AIDs that your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life how did he know did he s the Lamb's Book of Life no Paul saw the life of those Believers that their life has been changed they became the Living Word they became the living Apostles and when you became a living Apostles that is a sign brothers and sisters that your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen glory to God Amen praise be the name of Jesus Amen now there are four horse riders the white is the deception red the bloody persecution the black is the Dark Ages spiritual black out of light and Truth in those days and the fourth is the Pale Horse spiritual debt amen and what is spiritual debt that is total separation from the life of God come on amen that's the Pale Horse not so much scary to die physically but to die spiritually that's the most scary thing to happen to a man brothers and sisters yes sir amen when he disbelieves the word of the Living God Amen but there are four beasts to combat the four horse riders power right the PIP seal 1963 notice as the Antichrist went for on his Beast of ministry here God sent forth a beast to combat it see now watch then every time the Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse on his Beast to announce his ministry God sent his Beast also and he was on that to announce his combat to it that's what the prophet of God said and he explained in the seed shall not be here with the shock 1965 the four vist and the four horses now remember according to Revelation the whole mystery of the book is sealed with Seven Seals yes that the reformers did not have a chance to bring forth the four stages of reforming the four stages of our Beast that went out to meet the four powers of the world what was the first went out a lion to meet the Roman AGS that was the word the original he is the lion of the tribe of Judah yes sir Christ himself went to meet that age what was the next animal that went out to meet the next animal went out to meet the other horse rider what was he the first hor horse rider was dressed in white crown on his head later so forth but a bow with no arrows notice the second horse that went forth the Beast that went to meet him was an ox an ox is a beast of sacrifice they went went down in martyr drum during the Dark Age yes the third Beast that went to meet the next horse before that Horse Road death and Hell the next horse that went the Beast to meet the horse rider of that day was the Beast with the face of a man how many knows that the intellectual AIDS hallelu the reformers Luther Wesley Calvin knock finny Moody see yes sir but then notice what went forth in the evening time an eagle come on brother prophetic back again it shall be light about the eagle time Hallelujah the way to Glory you will surely find oh chch of the Living God blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen hallelujah yes come on now from the fourth seale if you remember the prophet of God said there is no more Beast announcement for the fifth seal the six and the Seven seal amen did you see that message entitled the fifth seal 1963 are you still there brothers and sisters amen okay thank you notice when he come to his F SE now there's no Rider Goes Forth there is no Beast to announce it the lamb opened it John saw it there was no one there to say now come look come notice no power of the living creature there anymore MH and on The Sixth Seal there is no Beast to announce and on the seventh seal there is no Beast to announce it no powers to announce it see no one does it after the fourth seal there is no Announcement by any beast power from the fifth six or the seven seal not at all now notice I love this the prophet of God said as in the times of the rider of the four horses the rider singular of the four different horses there was a beast that announced the power every time the rider struggled another horse and comfort to ride another kind of a Beast come out and announce it that's a great mystery that is the mystery why announcing the mystery amen why isn't there one here on the fifth seal to announce it here it is according to the Revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me today or this morning early that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time that's amen The Mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took his last ride and we found him on his Pale Horse mix with his many colors and rides all the way into bition we get it on the trumpets and so forth when we teach that I'd go to it now but we get plumed off the subject again that's the reason there is no one there we know written cause some reasons for something remember at The First beginning I said can't be nothing without a reason remember the littleit drop of ink now you got to find the reason well there was some reason they did not have to have a beast or a power to announce it this seal being broke Only God Can reveal why that's all amen but the reason that he reveals it as I understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church AIDS amen the fifth sale the sixth C they don't pertain to the church age anymore brother R said but the seven seal amen that's still part help the Bride of Jesus Christ amen the four stages of his riter has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist writing has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have to have anymore and there was four living creatures of God to announce the writer as they wrote for V are four poers now we know that this by interpretation of the terms of the Bible symbols means power now let's get that close the forist in the Bible represents a power among the people yes amen praise the Lord and this power did not came from us his power came from the Lord Jesus Christ and it was given to us to come the attack of the Antichrist against us in these last days brothers and sisters without the presence of God without the Holy Spirit without the word of God we will not be able to withstand this world is full of deception this world is controlled by the devil but God is good God be praise because he has given us his powers brothers and sisters amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm about to consume this glass of water now thank you Lord now let's go to the seventh seal 6 seal 1963 and the seventh seal is just one thing that's all it was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour now only God can reveal that it's not even symbolize nowhere the only seal that has no symbol yes sir amen the bridge between the seals the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals 1963 that have hour of Silence watch what takes place in that half hour of Silence when the seventh seal next Sunday night Lord William prophet of God said the fourth seal 1963 but there was silence for a half hour but there's something took place I'm expecting him to reveal it he'll do it I'm satisfied he will prophet of God said the seven seal 1963 and when the seals were opened God noticed he omitted revealing even any symbol of the seventh one it's a perfect secret with God Amen and the prophet of God said Heaven stops singing notice the bringing the breaking of this seal was so great the heavens was hushed by it in silence for the space of half an hour it is great what is it it was Hush Heavens there was nothing moved for half an hour Hallelujah now half an hour might be too long not night might not be too long if you're having a good time yes is that correct yes but if you are not having a good time that's already long amen and I hope we are having a good time tonight because you know 1 hour is already too long amen praise the Lord but in the suspense of between death and life it seems like a millennium it was so great Jesus never mentioned it none of the rest of them John could not even write of it he was forbidden to write it but this is silence yes sir the angel stop harping the four and 24 Elders that stood before God they're harping with their Harps they quit harping playing their Harps the angel H they're singing in Heaven yes think the holy cherubims and cims that Isaiah saw in the temple with three sets of wings two over his face two over his feet and two flying and day and night before God singing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and even when they walk or come into the temple the PO of the temple move with their presence and His holy Sims has up Angels quit singing yes sir flying in the presence of God singing Holy Holy Holy no Praises no altar service no nothing there was silence H deadly silence in heaven for half an hour all the host of Heaven Was silent and for this half hour when the seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it the lamb breaks it you know what they were ow by it I believed amen blessed be the name of the Lord what is the seventh seal brothers and sisters the prophet of God said why what was it now none of us know but I'm going to tell you my revelation of it the seven seal 1963 now who would reveal the seven seal brother Bram said the seven angels in pyramids constellation yes sir that's have you read that brothers and sisters they hold old the revelation of the mystery of that seven seal and brother bam even said that the most notable Angel the one on top of the pyramid ship he's the one who has got the revelation of the seven seal is that correct amen amen To God Be The Glory Hallelujah and these Seven Seals came these seven angels came to brother Bram and told him exactly the revelation of the Mysteries of the Seven Seals amen and brother brandham is the Fulfillment of the seventh angel Revelation 10:7 is that correct Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound to preach to teach ah the mysteries of God the Seven Seals amen the seven Thunders Hallelujah and the Loose Ends from the beginning to the end yes sir the loose throats brothers and sisters amen amen thank you so much my dear brother thank you so much I appreciate amen I hope I don't consume a gallon of water here amen thank you for your patience with me amen I hope this message of the Prophet is be a blessing to you brother sister amen this is not me I know nothing amen I am a nobody amen Jesus alone that's right must be lifted up in the midst of the church and we are just vessels of God right amen nothing to to Glory but save our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we just want the word and the Holy Spirit to channel and speak the thoughts of God not our thoughts that's why I plan to stay with what the prophet of God said just present it to the church and let it speak to you from the Holy Spirit and give you Revelation and understanding of this great message that came from God he has given it to us brothers and sisters amen that should be the name of the Lord 7even seal 1963 so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open see the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it that shows it's from God for see it fits exactly in the promises of God yes from the end of the message you notice for the End of Time message this seal End of Time message after he has revealed all the six but he did not say nothing about the seven and the end time time seal when it starts it will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that remember Revelation 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel message yes at the end of the seventh angel message all the mysteries of God would be known yes brother we are at the end time the opening of The Seven Seals amen the prophet of God said the seventh angel will open the mysteries of the seven seal why there was silence in heaven why why God did not show it in any form even in symbols God wants to keep this seven seal in secret he don't want anybody else to know about it yes even Satan the devil God does not want him to see or to hear anything of this great secret mystery amen amen that's the reason brother Brenham said it was kept silent and has no symbol on it he said the seven seal 1963 now why why this is silence why this is silent if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage yes there is one thing he don't know he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift true that's true I hope you're learning but he can't know that it's not even written it's not even written in the Bible yes sir amen it's a total secret Hallelujah prophet of God said Satan will know nothing about it you want something to happen you have to take my word for this if I'm planning on doing something uhh I know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person would tell it but Satan will hear it amen see he can't get it in my heart there as long as God has got it closed up with the holy spirit so that's between me and God he don't know nothing about it until you speak it he hears it and I have tried I tell people I'll do a certain certain thing and what's the devil cut off every will he can to get there before you to bit me to it true but if I get the Revelation from God and just don't say nothing about it sir then it's different amen and that's one of my weakness I will I will not you know include you in that sometimes I'm very excited oh I'm going to do this you know you can't hold it anymore because you're excited you want to tell the word what you want to plan to do but you know it behoves us sometimes to just be silent and pray before God what's what's ever inside this heart amen now remember Satan will try to impersonate every thing that the church will do try to do it we notice it through the anti christ you see that brothers and sisters the impersonation of Christianity in these last days did not the prophet said the first bride was deceived e and here e deceived the denomination and Pentecostals by saying in the Book of Genesis I have gotten a man from the Lord and by saying that the denomination took it and they said we don't believe in serpent seed because if said he has gotten a man from the Lord that was him that said he has gotten a child from the Lord not the word of God and that's why when the denomination and been read that they don't believe in serpent seed yes sir deceived by Eve amen they were deceived by Eve yes sir the the first bride was deceived yes sir and she is deceiving the people sir by the word amen amen and the prophet of God said the second bride was also deceived in 3:25 ad0 amen and she is doing the deceiving now Hallelujah the second bride that was deceived she is deceiving the People by the word yes sir by the perverted word right right and they are going to try to deceive what the third bride brother said because the third bride is the restor and pure bride in these last days amen hallelujah can you say Amen to that brothers and sisters is that correct amen amen and that's why the prophet of God said the false anointed ones in these last days and the true anointed ones in these last days the only difference that you can see between them it's not their life they can copy the fruits of the Holy Spirit too amen they're also good they they changed life but brother bam said the only difference between the false anointed ones and the true anointed ones is their teaching their teaching is contrary to the word of God they are also baptized with the Holy Spirit by said they are genuinely the prophet of God said they are genuinely baptized with the holy spirit amen but in their soul they disbelieve the message of the hour they disbelieve and add and diminish the message of the prophet and they claim to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ to waiting for the Rapture amen I do believe that this church is not the second bride that was deceived this church is the third bride amen that true restored third bride the true church of our Lord Jesus Christ that believes every word and say to the word of God Amen to every word of God hallelujah amen blessed be the name of Jesus you know I'm just getting excited but what's the time it's already 9 you know I hope I'm not the only one excited [Laughter] here but I told our dear Pastor I will just you know continue this on December 3 before I go back to the Philippines amen so let me just close this uh part one message brothers and sisters before we finally close this amen I hope uh you love the word of God tonight amen everybody loves the word of God Amen the true Sons and Daughters of God we love the word of God and uh we we cannot add see I do not want to add and I cannot add to it's already complete message you don't need to add you just read the message it's already there nothing to add you cannot diminish this message it's complete brothers and sisters all you have to do is pray read and study and with good motive and intention God through the holy spirit will reveal it to the pastor to the ministers to the true members of the fightful ministry amen hallelujah blessed be the name of Jesus okay let me wrap this this up May my brothers and sisters amen before I close this part one message amen so see that there's no mimic to the seven seal no impersonation because it was silent yes sir no symbol Satan has no idea what it is so it cannot be impersonated because brother bam said Satan can impersonate everything he hears everything he saw is already already have a copy cut no that's how the devil is but in this seven sh the prophet of God said he said remember Satan will try to impersonate everything and the prophet of God said but this is one thing excuse me this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this because he don't know there's no way for him to know it it's the third pole he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it and what is the third poll brother Bram said the opening of the word what is the third pull is speaking the word into existence and Satan cannot create amen that power to create belongs to God and to his sons and daughters only Satan cannot do it Satan cannot speak the word into existence that's why he cannot impersonate ated brothers and sisters he cannot mimic this glory to Jesus Hallelujah that's the third pool bam said amen amen glory to Jesus amen one more quach Christ is the mystery we revealed 1963 God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels did not understand it no he did not reveal it that's the reason under the seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence yes Hallelujah Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen God has this all to himself is a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half hour and notice brothers and sisters and seven Thunders yes sir uttered their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord uhuh there's one thing he has not revealed it of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know amen blessed be the name of the Lord and there are many quotations you can read in the message of the Prophet where he said that the the seven seal is the coming of the Lord yes sir now what coming brother Bram said there are are two kinds of coming appearing and coming in Corporal form amen that's what the prophet of God said before the Corporal body comes to redeem the bride he will appear firstall and brother Bram said Revelation 101 to4 yes that's the appearing of Christ on Earth as a mighty angel with an open book with the Seven Seals broke amen amen to reveal the Mysteries to the seventh angel brother Bram amen that's the appearing of Christ the appearing has to happen before the coming because the appearing will prepare the bride for the rapturing Fai he cannot come come in his second coming with Corporal without first appearing to prepare the bride for the rupturing of the church brothers and sisters amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen glory to Jesus amen amen I must stop now I'm getting excited brothers and sisters amen the the outside is is knowing thank you so much To God Be praise God Be The Glory thank you to our beloved Pastor Amen to the Elders of the
