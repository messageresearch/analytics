[33:58] Holy Ground one more time is a
[34:02] declaration tonight
[34:04] [Music]
[34:37] this is
[34:45] Jesus now
[34:49] [Music]
[34:58] it is
[35:05] let us pray
[35:10] our most
[35:12] gracious Heavenly and loving father
[35:17] those are not just the words we are
[35:20] singing because you have given us bread
[35:24] but it is true we are standing on a Holy
[35:28] Ground
[35:30] we know we are in your presence father
[35:34] Lord Jesus when one time your Prophet
[35:38] Moses came in your presence
[35:40] you told him to remove the shoes because
[35:42] the place where he was standing was a
[35:44] holy crowd
[35:46] when Elijah the prophet came in your
[35:48] presence he felt so much unworthy until
[35:52] he cried well unto me
[35:54] but Heavenly Father you have brought us
[35:56] your presence you have counted us worthy
[35:59] to be partakers of your blessings and
[36:02] even that's the reason you have brought
[36:03] us into this Sanctuary for one purpose
[36:06] that is to worship you
[36:08] may you accept our worship Lord
[36:11] Jesus Christ may you take now control of
[36:15] the meeting from now up to the end
[36:17] so that Lord Jesus Christ
[36:20] father when we leave this place may we
[36:22] have a testimony that surely God has
[36:25] spoken to me
[36:26] we need you Lord I need you Heavenly
[36:30] Father even as I stand before your
[36:32] children who have defied the odds of the
[36:35] weather to come unto this Sanctuary Lord
[36:38] Jesus I know because they are hungry
[36:40] they want to be fed
[36:42] Lord Jesus let me not be a hindrance for
[36:45] them to receive what thou has purposed
[36:47] for them to receive father now I commit
[36:51] the service in your hands we return it
[36:53] back to you father because you have
[36:55] given it unto us I also commit myself in
[36:58] your hands a lot
[37:00] may you just borrow my lips heavenly
[37:02] father and use them for their glory and
[37:04] honor to your name
[37:06] now as we go to read your word may you
[37:09] give us the understanding of the
[37:10] scriptures that we are going to read
[37:12] further blessed and Sanctified Lord as
[37:14] we commit all things now to you in Jesus
[37:17] Christ's name we pray
[37:19] thank you musicians
[37:24] are you happy to be in the house of the
[37:25] Lord
[37:29] sometimes how God works
[37:33] the song our brother led us to sing of
[37:39] would you be free from the burden of sin
[37:42] that was to be my my closing song
[37:44] [Laughter]
[37:47] so anyway we thank God for everything
[37:50] let's turn to our Bibles
[37:54] Deuteronomy chapter 15.
[38:02] Deuteronomy chapter 15.
[38:16] we rate verse 1 and verse 2.
[38:24] then we will also read from Leviticus
[38:28] chapter 25
[38:29] verse 8 and 9.
[38:33] if you are there you can say Amen
[38:36] okay good
[38:38] at the end of every seven years thou
[38:41] shall make a release
[38:44] and this is the manner of the release
[38:46] every creditor that lendeth ought unto
[38:49] his neighbor shall release it he shall
[38:52] not exert it of his neighbor or of his
[38:55] brother because it is called the Lord's
[38:58] release
[39:01] Leviticus 25 verse 8 and 9.
[39:13] amen
[39:21] and thou shall number seven sabbaths of
[39:24] years unto thee seven times seven years
[39:27] in the space of the seven sabbaths of
[39:30] years shall be unto thee forty and nine
[39:33] years
[39:34] then shall thou cause the trumpet of the
[39:37] tupilitu sound on the tenth day of the
[39:40] seventh month in the day of atonement
[39:43] shall I make the trumpet sound
[39:46] throughout all your land
[39:49] now that verse 9 we are connecting it
[39:53] with Revelation 10 7.
[39:57] you can take your seats
[40:05] okay now
[40:10] I've called it the title of my sermon
[40:14] breaking
[40:15] from the wrong cycle
[40:22] but uh
[40:23] the scripture where we read it talks
[40:26] about the Lord's release
[40:31] now other versions like if you have NIV
[40:34] it says debt cancellation
[40:39] so whatever whatever situation that fits
[40:42] you you can put yourself there if it is
[40:44] debt consolidation you can call it debt
[40:46] consolation if it is loads release you
[40:49] can say I'm free then
[40:52] if the breaking out of the psycho fits
[40:55] you you can put yourself there but I've
[40:57] called it breaking out of the wrong
[40:59] cycle
[41:01] now
[41:02] there has never been a time in life that
[41:05] people have dates like now
[41:11] maybe you might say oh me I don't have
[41:14] any debt
[41:16] we have cleared everything
[41:19] wait
[41:21] ever a newborn baby the moment the
[41:24] moment the child receives the first
[41:26] breath the next is to receive the debt
[41:29] that will be paid in lifetime
[41:32] in times of taxes under levies
[41:38] I'll support it with a quote
[41:42] nations are in-depth
[41:45] even Canada
[41:48] even the superpower
[41:52] the superpower the prophet says
[41:55] in the message the stage of a perfect
[41:57] man this present government now is
[42:00] spending money for what for tax money
[42:03] that they will pay collecting for 40
[42:06] years from now that was 1962.
[42:10] now if 1962 they had debts that they
[42:14] were to pay in 40 years
[42:17] that is U.S what about Canada
[42:21] but I may not allow me to talk about the
[42:23] other countries
[42:27] amen
[42:29] so now
[42:32] if the whole world is in debt
[42:35] who is the owner of the depth
[42:39] there must be sample there must be
[42:41] somebody controlling
[42:48] amen now the prophet says the Beast who
[42:53] owns the cold of the world will put the
[42:56] world in a debt trap
[43:00] so the honor of the depth is the Beast
[43:04] and he owns the code of the world
[43:09] now
[43:10] spiritually speaking that should be a
[43:13] sign that human beings are Also
[43:15] spiritually indebted
[43:21] and that's now the line we are going
[43:24] now
[43:26] many things
[43:28] life or you worry about they have
[43:30] nothing to do with you but you are
[43:33] servicing a depth of somebody
[43:43] Numbers Chapter 14 verses 18. let's read
[43:46] it
[43:47] as I try to build my thought
[43:59] numbers 14.
[44:10] verse 18.
[44:13] the Lord is long-suffering and of great
[44:15] Mercy for giving iniquity and
[44:18] transgression and by no means clearing
[44:21] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[44:24] fathers upon the children under the
[44:27] thought under the fourth generation
[44:31] so
[44:33] the problem that you might be going
[44:35] through it is not yours
[44:38] you are servicing the debt that was
[44:40] committed by somebody in your lineage
[44:46] if you have a temper that you cannot
[44:48] control it is not you it is not your
[44:51] fault
[44:52] you are servicing a debt that was
[44:54] committed by somebody in your in your
[44:56] lineage
[44:57] and that's why it calls now for the New
[45:01] Path and the reason Jesus told Nicodemus
[45:04] you must be born again so that you
[45:07] change the lineage
[45:10] so that you come to a point where you
[45:13] can break the cycle
[45:15] and it can be done
[45:19] amen
[45:24] everything that you cry about or that
[45:27] and Christianity that that that makes
[45:29] you to makes you to unchristianize
[45:31] yourself
[45:33] you didn't do it
[45:36] you are just servicing the depth of
[45:38] somebody
[45:39] somebody in your lineage the scripture
[45:42] has said that he will
[45:44] take the iniquities and therefore up to
[45:47] the third under the fourth generation
[45:52] we come to it in a minute oh my
[45:55] now
[45:56] but you are true nature
[46:00] is a predestinated seed
[46:04] of God that jumped from the mind of God
[46:07] by by passing the theophany but now it
[46:11] is being delivered back to you
[46:14] Hallelujah the seed is now being
[46:17] delivered back to you
[46:23] so what is the greatest what is the
[46:27] cause of the the depth it is hybriding
[46:32] the way we came
[46:34] we came the wrong way
[46:36] and that's why you need to be born again
[46:41] amen now
[46:43] if somebody comes and fixes your
[46:46] hybriding
[46:48] then what happens the dates are canceled
[46:54] if you can fix your path then the dates
[46:58] are canceled
[47:00] let me put it this way if you discover
[47:02] today that you belong to a country that
[47:06] has no debt
[47:09] yeah
[47:12] if you discover today that you belong to
[47:14] a country that has no debt what will
[47:16] happen
[47:18] all the debts that you have they will be
[47:20] counseled because you don't belong to
[47:22] this country
[47:24] you belong to the other country that has
[47:26] no debts
[47:27] and we have our country we have our home
[47:30] where we have no debts
[47:39] amen
[47:41] so
[47:42] the moment you discover
[47:46] that you belong to another citizens to
[47:50] another country you are the citizen of
[47:54] another country the moment you discover
[47:56] that Discovery we are calling it a
[48:00] revelation
[48:02] yeah
[48:05] when it is revealed to you
[48:08] that this world is not your home
[48:11] you belong to another country
[48:15] then that consoles all the debts that
[48:18] you have
[48:20] and you can say I am free
[48:27] so you need to you need to remember
[48:31] where you came from
[48:34] little
[48:38] oh my
[48:42] God may God help us
[48:44] so we are protect of the spoken word
[48:50] we are products of the spoken one
[48:54] so that is how now our genealogy you can
[48:58] now address your genealogy from from the
[49:03] beginning
[49:04] from the mind of God you can trace your
[49:07] genealogy and say I was in the mind of
[49:10] God
[49:11] I was the change in the mind of God
[49:15] I bypass the theophany but now the
[49:18] theophany has come back to open itself
[49:22] so that I become now this your funny
[49:24] that I pay fast
[49:27] in the mind we were both
[49:30] thoughts in the mind of God With Jesus
[49:32] Christ
[49:34] him he came from the thought he came to
[49:38] the theophany from the theophany he came
[49:40] into the flesh but for our case we
[49:44] bypass the theophany we come direct into
[49:47] the flesh but now that theophany that we
[49:50] bypass has now come
[49:54] and that's why we say we are hearing
[49:58] from our Theo families
[50:05] don't worry I've not started my subject
[50:14] okay
[50:23] God help us
[50:25] he died in the message the spoken word
[50:28] is the Original Seed he died in order to
[50:32] pay the debt of your high breeding my my
[50:35] there it is what it is that you could
[50:38] die to yourself until you are no more
[50:41] yourself
[50:42] and be filled with his word believing
[50:45] his word then the holy spirit that was
[50:48] in him comes down to water that word
[50:51] that make that will make it to grow
[50:55] man
[50:59] I say it was I say it on Sunday
[51:02] somewhere
[51:03] that uh
[51:05] if you are accused today of being a
[51:07] Christian
[51:09] can they find something in you to
[51:12] convict you
[51:20] the life that you live if you are
[51:22] accused of being a Christian can they
[51:24] find something to convict you
[51:30] because it's more than wearing a long
[51:32] dress
[51:34] it's more it's more than carrying these
[51:36] message books
[51:38] can they find something to convict you
[51:45] can somebody preach with me
[51:49] can they find something to convict you
[51:56] I'll leave it for you to do to you to do
[52:00] it yourself
[52:01] amen
[52:05] okay
[52:07] I'll just try to summarize because I
[52:09] have a lot
[52:11] the pastor says you see if you keep
[52:13] these guys for so long they accumulate
[52:15] too much if they don't release
[52:23] [Music]
[52:26] now
[52:28] you could not access your home that is
[52:31] Canon or a true baptism of the Holy
[52:34] Ghost but now it has been made possible
[52:37] by Crossing Jordan that is the opening
[52:40] of the seals
[52:45] foreign
[52:49] has one job and that is to water the
[52:52] word
[52:57] so what am I trying to say
[52:59] take the word have something in you
[53:03] what is that something the word
[53:06] when you have the word and the spirit
[53:08] comes it comes to water the word
[53:11] but what if you don't have the word when
[53:14] the spirit comes and it doesn't find the
[53:16] word it makes you just a religious a
[53:20] religious and religious something that
[53:23] cannot produce the Life of Christ
[53:29] may God help us
[53:32] so the question is
[53:35] how often do you read the word
[53:42] and how men are here that reads the word
[53:45] every day
[53:52] I was looking I was I was trying to look
[53:55] for that quote then yesterday I was
[53:57] listening to them I was listening the
[53:58] message the lamp and the Dove and then
[54:00] that quote came
[54:02] that you need to read the Bible
[54:05] at least a chapter in the morning and a
[54:08] chapter in the evening before you sleep
[54:11] that's the prophet
[54:14] how men are doing that
[54:19] that's the prophet that's like what
[54:24] God help us
[54:27] so you need to have the word so that
[54:30] when the spirit comes it quickens to
[54:33] bring now to life that word that is in
[54:36] you mark that statement will come to eat
[54:41] you must have something
[54:48] so when you take the word and hide it in
[54:51] your heart then it comes the Holy Spirit
[54:53] comes to water it
[54:55] this could not happen now let's we come
[54:58] now to our subject this could not happen
[55:00] in the seven Church ages
[55:10] so I I don't there's no need to repeat
[55:12] it
[55:14] there is church
[55:16] now the year of release could not be
[55:20] declared during the time of the seven
[55:23] Church ages we read the Scripture it
[55:26] says after seven years or after seven
[55:30] Church ages now he shall declare the
[55:34] Lord's release
[55:35] so the Lord's release has come after the
[55:38] church ages
[55:40] so to which means during the church ages
[55:43] the Lord's release could not be
[55:45] pronounced
[55:47] during the church edges the year the
[55:50] sounding of the Jubilee for your freedom
[55:53] was not pronounced until after the
[55:56] church ages
[56:01] may God help us
[56:04] we will see it in a minute
[56:06] so
[56:08] it could not happen during the church
[56:10] edges this after the charge edges
[56:14] now the Lord comes and declares the year
[56:18] of release
[56:20] now after he has declared the year of
[56:23] release now you can say I am free
[56:28] but you must see it
[56:31] accept it
[56:33] and believe it
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:41] it must become a revelation
[56:44] to you once it has been revealed to you
[56:49] now you can say I see
[56:55] okay
[56:57] amen
[56:59] now
[57:02] the reason we can go free is very simple
[57:06] is because we have been placed here at
[57:09] the time of the Lord's release
[57:15] God help us
[57:18] okay
[57:23] now Jehovah waited until Jordan was
[57:26] Jordan was flooding for him to make a
[57:29] way for his children to cross he waited
[57:32] until your spiritual debt is overflowing
[57:35] then he comes and declares the Lord's
[57:38] release
[57:45] okay
[57:46] the release
[57:49] was if
[57:51] you are an Israelite
[57:58] Forerunner Israelite
[58:01] you had to work
[58:03] until you pay the debt in full or until
[58:07] that you believe is declared
[58:11] but for the other fellows who could not
[58:14] who are not Israelites they were to be
[58:17] taken as Bond slaves
[58:23] I believe I'm speaking to the spiritual
[58:27] Israelites
[58:32] unto whom
[58:34] the Year of Jubilee has been announced
[58:39] and the sound the trumpet sound has
[58:43] sounded
[58:44] so when you hear the trumpet sound not
[58:48] with his ears amen you can sit here you
[58:52] can stay here for years and say I've
[58:55] been a Believer for 20 30 50 years but
[58:59] until it becomes a spiritual revelation
[59:04] then you say I see I am free
[59:10] may God help us
[59:19] amen
[59:21] so
[59:22] when the release is being announced it
[59:26] is not for everybody
[59:28] is for them that will hear
[59:34] we used to sing a song in Sunday School
[59:38] that when he comes he doesn't scoop
[59:42] or shovel he picks he said it
[59:48] now he's selecting those who are his
[59:55] so how is he selecting he comes and
[59:58] flashes before your eyes your
[1:00:01] citizenship
[1:00:04] when you say you are citizenship
[1:00:07] then you denounce the citizens the
[1:00:10] citizenship of the country that you are
[1:00:12] in
[1:00:13] we are not of this world so what he does
[1:00:17] he flashes before your eyes
[1:00:21] that's it your citizenship
[1:00:26] may God help us
[1:00:29] so he's on he has announced the year of
[1:00:32] release
[1:00:34] you can be debt free debt free right now
[1:00:37] if your eyes can be opened to see it
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:46] okay
[1:00:47] after the church edges are over and the
[1:00:50] true seat has come through the shark at
[1:00:52] the Pentecostals The Remnant called
[1:00:54] through the message charge God is not
[1:00:57] going to rupture the message charge but
[1:01:00] he is going to Rapture his own seats
[1:01:07] you carry the message books and say we
[1:01:09] belong to the message Church no he is
[1:01:12] not coming to Rapture The Message Church
[1:01:14] he's coming to select his own seeds
[1:01:18] by flashing before them they sit their
[1:01:22] citizenship
[1:01:25] may God open my eyes to see my
[1:01:27] citizenship
[1:01:30] in the message desperation the prophet
[1:01:32] says the devil can impersonate any of
[1:01:35] those things but he cannot be the
[1:01:37] Holocaust
[1:01:39] oh yeah
[1:01:40] he can impersonate these gifts but he
[1:01:43] can't be the Holocaust and the Holocaust
[1:01:46] is the token that the blood has been
[1:01:48] applied because it follows the blood all
[1:01:52] the way
[1:01:53] from your Redemption
[1:02:04] and now
[1:02:07] I'm still quoting from the message
[1:02:09] desperations and now the entire holy
[1:02:12] spirit beasts the church
[1:02:15] making God in human flesh
[1:02:23] all
[1:02:24] that he hasn't done through the church
[1:02:26] ages in the he is now doing back to the
[1:02:30] world
[1:02:33] because the messages and the messages
[1:02:36] and the messages has to wind up in the
[1:02:40] entire world and in the last days the
[1:02:43] Seven Seals be the Seven Seals being
[1:02:45] opened was to pick up every struggles
[1:02:48] that has been left off of in it and make
[1:02:51] the whole thing in one great big body
[1:02:54] The Pride
[1:02:59] amen now the devil cannot be our depth
[1:03:04] release
[1:03:06] if anything he's the owner of the Dead
[1:03:10] so what he will what what he will do he
[1:03:13] wants to make sure you feel comfortable
[1:03:20] but you are
[1:03:22] under him
[1:03:25] he doesn't want to release you
[1:03:28] it reminds me what I was preaching
[1:03:30] sometimes somewhere
[1:03:33] about captivity
[1:03:36] you can come from this captivity and you
[1:03:39] enter into another captivity if you are
[1:03:41] not careful
[1:03:43] it happened with the children of Israel
[1:03:45] they came from captivity in Egypt but
[1:03:48] then they found themselves in another
[1:03:49] captivity in papyrone
[1:03:53] so you can come from the world that is
[1:03:56] one captivity and you come into the
[1:03:59] church
[1:04:01] and become under another another
[1:04:03] captivity
[1:04:06] but the genuine children of God are
[1:04:09] praising on every day you are hungering
[1:04:12] you are fasting you are crying you are
[1:04:15] not satisfied with yourself
[1:04:16] I'm not satisfied with what I am I I
[1:04:19] need more I want more
[1:04:24] your cry is you are crying every day you
[1:04:27] stand before the mirror every morning
[1:04:29] every time you start before the mirror
[1:04:31] and say Lord help me I want to achieve
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:41] God help us
[1:04:45] oh my
[1:04:48] okay
[1:04:51] Luke Chapter 4 verses 18.
[1:05:02] okay I'll just okay let's let's read it
[1:05:07] I want to come to the point where
[1:05:12] we will see Who We Are
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:19] Luke chapter 4 verse 18.
[1:05:23] the Bible says the spirit of the Lord is
[1:05:25] upon me because he has he has anointed
[1:05:29] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:05:32] hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:05:34] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:05:37] and the recovering of sight to the blind
[1:05:40] to set at Liberty them that are poised
[1:05:44] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:05:47] Lord
[1:05:52] that was Jesus Christ he was to preach
[1:05:55] the acceptable here
[1:05:58] but that year did not come at that time
[1:06:00] it came after the seventh judge ages
[1:06:04] that's when now God has come to declare
[1:06:07] the Lord's release
[1:06:09] then we must be special people brethrens
[1:06:12] that we are living at the time when God
[1:06:16] has declared
[1:06:17] here the year of release so you can go
[1:06:21] free you can be free if you allow the
[1:06:25] word to come
[1:06:29] God help us
[1:06:32] oh
[1:06:34] he came to heal the process
[1:06:37] what are the process the wounds regrets
[1:06:41] some complexes
[1:06:43] that we have
[1:06:45] may God help us
[1:06:48] I wish we had time to go back to that
[1:06:50] that sermon of complexes
[1:06:52] so that we see how how how how we have
[1:06:55] complexes in our lives
[1:07:00] hey hey man okay
[1:07:07] in the message this day this scripture
[1:07:09] is fulfilled
[1:07:12] paragraph 46 the prophet says the
[1:07:14] acceptable year we we as we all know as
[1:07:19] Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee
[1:07:22] that when all slaves and the prisoners
[1:07:25] as they were been taken prison and had
[1:07:28] to give a son to pay adept or a daughter
[1:07:33] to pay a debt
[1:07:37] and they were in bondage no matter how
[1:07:40] long they had been in bondage or how
[1:07:43] long they were supposed to stay there
[1:07:45] when the year come of that you believe
[1:07:48] when the trumpet sounded every man could
[1:07:52] go free if he wanted to go free
[1:07:56] you are free
[1:07:58] when they to believe sounded
[1:08:04] when that trumpet sounded
[1:08:08] you live whatever you are doing
[1:08:12] even if your boss
[1:08:15] had sent you to the farm
[1:08:17] and you are there
[1:08:19] whatever you are doing once you hear the
[1:08:22] trumpet
[1:08:23] you want to leave everything that you
[1:08:26] are you are doing and say I am free
[1:08:30] you can no longer take his instructions
[1:08:35] where are you going I am free
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:43] remember we said who is the owner of the
[1:08:46] Dead Saturn
[1:08:49] so if you have been under his captivity
[1:08:52] and you hear that trumpet sound for your
[1:08:55] release you leave everything that you
[1:08:58] are doing
[1:08:59] don't carry anything
[1:09:02] that he might he might follow me and ask
[1:09:04] no no no no don't carry everything read
[1:09:06] everything there start running you are
[1:09:08] free
[1:09:12] God help us
[1:09:15] okay
[1:09:19] what a perfect example it is of the
[1:09:22] Gospel of Jesus Christ when it is
[1:09:24] preached the acceptable time and the
[1:09:27] time of Jubilee anybody no matter who
[1:09:29] you are what color you are what
[1:09:32] denomination you belong to how it is far
[1:09:34] how far you have stopped in sin or what
[1:09:37] is wrong with you you can go free when
[1:09:40] you hear the trumpet sounds
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:47] okay
[1:09:49] now
[1:09:51] when the man is truly in the message
[1:09:55] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:09:58] when man is truly redeemed
[1:10:02] that predestinated seed remember we are
[1:10:05] following that seed
[1:10:07] yeah so listen when and when man is
[1:10:11] truly redeemed that pretestinated seed
[1:10:15] that is that sees it and accepts it
[1:10:19] his sins are demolished
[1:10:26] when you see it and accept it your sins
[1:10:31] are
[1:10:38] when you see it and accept it
[1:10:41] your sins are
[1:10:44] demolished
[1:10:46] where are they taken in the sea
[1:10:49] of forgetfulness
[1:10:52] let some brothers and start some sisters
[1:10:55] try fishing fishing them out
[1:11:01] oh you know you did this you know you
[1:11:03] did this I it's no it's not counted on
[1:11:06] me
[1:11:08] the Lord doesn't remember
[1:11:18] so if you see it and accept it your sins
[1:11:21] are demolished
[1:11:24] if right now you can see it and accept
[1:11:27] it you are still your sins will be
[1:11:29] demolished
[1:11:30] then you can say I'm free
[1:11:34] would you be free from your burden of oh
[1:11:39] my goodness okay now
[1:11:42] oh sorry
[1:11:46] oh my goodness
[1:11:50] now if your sins have been demolished
[1:11:53] then you are the person who has Saturn's
[1:11:56] answer
[1:11:58] you have an answer to the devil's
[1:12:01] question
[1:12:03] now what is the devil's question who is
[1:12:06] this
[1:12:07] you can live a life until the devil asks
[1:12:11] who is this
[1:12:15] because you are not you are it is not
[1:12:17] you you died to yourself Christ took
[1:12:21] over so as the day as they asked at that
[1:12:24] time who is this who are they asking
[1:12:27] they were asking about Jesus Christ so
[1:12:29] today you can also live our life until
[1:12:32] the devil will be asking who is this and
[1:12:35] that's why the prophet says we have an
[1:12:38] answer to the devil's question if you
[1:12:41] have accepted if you sow your name if
[1:12:45] you had there to be this sound and you
[1:12:48] say I am free
[1:12:51] then you can now live the life
[1:12:58] oh my
[1:13:00] okay
[1:13:03] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:13:05] verses 18 we do not read Because of time
[1:13:08] I want to finish somewhere
[1:13:11] so
[1:13:14] the Bible says come and buy
[1:13:19] now and a business to do with the buying
[1:13:22] or selling it has to involve two people
[1:13:27] some transactions has to take place
[1:13:30] now what is the transaction
[1:13:33] because he says comment by by of me
[1:13:35] called
[1:13:36] yeah
[1:13:39] I solve that your eyes may be opened
[1:13:43] so you need to buy now the I self
[1:13:46] to apply to your eyes
[1:13:49] why because Jesus Christ said he came to
[1:13:52] preach to the blind
[1:13:54] to Open the Eyes of the blind now the
[1:13:57] Year of Jubilee the year of the Lord's
[1:14:00] release is to open your eyes and how are
[1:14:03] your eyes opened your eyes are opened by
[1:14:07] the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:14:11] The Mystery of the book we are not now
[1:14:14] preaching the mystery it has been
[1:14:16] revealed
[1:14:20] why to open your eyes
[1:14:24] for what so that you can see yourself
[1:14:27] that you are in God's mind
[1:14:33] oh my may God help us
[1:14:35] may my eyes be opened so that I can see
[1:14:39] where I am you can now dress you are
[1:14:42] genealogy and say I thought I did come
[1:14:45] from Africa no I came from God's mind
[1:14:49] and that's where I'm going
[1:14:54] oh my
[1:14:57] okay
[1:15:00] oh yes
[1:15:02] come in Dubai
[1:15:04] what happens the transaction is done now
[1:15:07] you can say it is done that great
[1:15:11] transactions done
[1:15:14] I am my Lord and He is mine
[1:15:19] he drew me and I followed on
[1:15:24] come to confess
[1:15:27] oh my goodness
[1:15:30] my brothers from Africa when you talk
[1:15:33] about being Charmed they understand
[1:15:34] better
[1:15:37] you are jumped
[1:15:41] I am jumped to confess
[1:15:49] what happened
[1:15:52] I I can't help myself
[1:15:56] he did something for me that I can't
[1:16:00] help myself to confess his love divine
[1:16:05] I can't help myself
[1:16:08] God help us
[1:16:12] oh yes so when the Devil comes and says
[1:16:15] you are a liar
[1:16:17] oh you remember the other day what you
[1:16:19] did
[1:16:21] then he's a liar himself
[1:16:23] God doesn't see he doesn't remember
[1:16:28] if you had it and if you had the year
[1:16:33] off to believe the trumpet sound being
[1:16:37] pronounced oh my
[1:16:42] okay
[1:16:43] in the message thou no waste all things
[1:16:47] it is in me eternal life now we are the
[1:16:51] sons of God not we will be
[1:16:56] I expected a very big amen
[1:16:59] but because of the depth of
[1:17:04] the dead is so big sometimes even when
[1:17:06] you are told you are now you are a son
[1:17:08] of God you say me
[1:17:14] oh my
[1:17:17] God to help us
[1:17:19] okay
[1:17:20] let's start to I have to second Kings
[1:17:24] chapter four I have to finish
[1:17:33] as we turn to Second Kings
[1:17:36] yeah
[1:17:39] brothers and sisters
[1:17:42] let us eat the word
[1:17:48] okay
[1:17:53] Second Kings
[1:17:54] chapter 4.
[1:18:00] okay
[1:18:11] now they are great a certain woman of
[1:18:14] the wives of the sons of the prophets
[1:18:16] and Elijah saying they servant my
[1:18:19] husband is dead and thou knowest that
[1:18:22] thy servant did fear the lord and the
[1:18:25] Creditor is come to take unto him my two
[1:18:30] sons to be born to men remember we said
[1:18:33] the prophet said they were to pay
[1:18:37] with yourself you are to pay with your
[1:18:39] sons or your daughters
[1:18:41] to pay the debt
[1:18:43] yeah so now here it is being applied
[1:18:46] this woman comes to Elijah and says that
[1:18:52] credit my husband died you know
[1:18:55] and he left some depth
[1:18:58] and now the Creditor has come
[1:19:01] to claim my sons to pay for those debts
[1:19:06] you can now get it huh that at that time
[1:19:10] as they come to auction they will not
[1:19:12] only auction your car you have your
[1:19:14] house and everything but they also
[1:19:16] auction your children
[1:19:20] so that's why it was the concern of this
[1:19:23] woman and she went to Elisha
[1:19:27] are we together now okay let's continue
[1:19:31] and Elijah said unto her what shall I do
[1:19:34] for thee tell me what has thou in the
[1:19:38] house
[1:19:39] one
[1:19:41] Elijah was the spirit of Elijah in the
[1:19:45] presence of in the absence of Elijah
[1:19:50] Elijah was the voice of Elijah in the
[1:19:55] present in the absence of Elijah
[1:19:59] I want this one to sing
[1:20:03] Elisha was The Voice
[1:20:06] of Elijah in the absence of Elijah
[1:20:16] we have Malachi 4. the prophet of
[1:20:19] Malachi 4 Elijah the prophet now in his
[1:20:23] absence the voice is still on
[1:20:26] [Laughter]
[1:20:30] the voice of Elijah is still on
[1:20:34] now Elijah was the voice of Elijah in
[1:20:39] the absence of Elijah
[1:20:41] now this woman went to Elijah now she
[1:20:45] presented her case
[1:20:48] okay
[1:20:49] now Elijah asks her what do you have
[1:20:56] what do you have
[1:20:59] you must have something
[1:21:02] and that's why I say it earlier on
[1:21:04] take the word
[1:21:06] eat the word
[1:21:08] so that when you are asked what do you
[1:21:09] have what do you have
[1:21:11] I have hit Thy word in my heart
[1:21:16] that is what I have
[1:21:19] so this woman was asked by Elijah what
[1:21:22] do you have
[1:21:27] tell me what has now in the house
[1:21:30] and she said thine handmade hath not
[1:21:34] anything in the House serve a pot of oil
[1:21:40] can you imagine
[1:21:42] you have a debt
[1:21:45] remember we say it
[1:21:46] all that is all that is happening in
[1:21:49] your life you are paying the debt of
[1:21:51] somebody
[1:21:52] now this woman was found was found
[1:21:55] herself in a situation where she has to
[1:21:57] pay the debt of the husband
[1:22:04] you are paying the debt of somebody
[1:22:07] so she found herself in a situation
[1:22:09] where she had to pay the debt of her
[1:22:12] husband
[1:22:14] and because she was a neighbor and
[1:22:16] that's why she went to there she went to
[1:22:18] Elisha
[1:22:19] now Elijah maybe let's say she had two
[1:22:23] million the debt was to the deputy was 2
[1:22:25] million
[1:22:26] and now Elijah asks her what do you have
[1:22:30] in the house
[1:22:34] what you have can save you
[1:22:38] what do you have
[1:22:41] At first she said I have nothing
[1:22:48] there is a comma there
[1:22:50] and the last time I preached here I said
[1:22:52] when it comes to the Bible when it comes
[1:22:54] to God even akoma can mean something
[1:22:57] different can change the situation
[1:23:01] so there is a comma there so after she
[1:23:04] said the handmaid has nothing
[1:23:07] then she remembered she has some little
[1:23:09] oil
[1:23:11] then she said accept
[1:23:16] okay
[1:23:18] no no no no no
[1:23:21] set your mind now to to to to receive
[1:23:24] the miracle
[1:23:27] after she said she had just but a little
[1:23:31] oil
[1:23:33] then the prophet said
[1:23:36] then he said Go parody vessels up
[1:23:40] vessels are brought of all thy neighbors
[1:23:43] even empty vessels borrow not a few
[1:23:50] now I just have she said I just have a
[1:23:53] little
[1:23:55] oh yeah then the prophet says go and the
[1:23:59] borrowed vessels
[1:24:00] and not just a few
[1:24:02] borrow
[1:24:04] bring them
[1:24:06] why a miracle was going to happen
[1:24:10] but he never told her that America was
[1:24:12] going to happen
[1:24:13] what she needed to do was to obey the
[1:24:17] voice of the prophet
[1:24:22] now we have said we are living in the
[1:24:25] day of The Voice
[1:24:28] so obey what the voice tells you to do
[1:24:35] so after she after she will obeyed the
[1:24:37] voice of the prophet let's see what what
[1:24:40] happened
[1:24:43] okay verse 4 and when thou art come come
[1:24:47] in thou shall shut the door upon thee
[1:24:51] and upon thy sons and shall pour out
[1:24:55] into all those vessels and thou shall
[1:24:57] set aside that which is full
[1:25:01] oh my goodness
[1:25:03] shut yourself in the house
[1:25:06] there's that song we usually chatting
[1:25:08] with it Jesus
[1:25:09] chatting with God
[1:25:13] so the prophet is telling her
[1:25:16] shutting the house
[1:25:18] listen to the message
[1:25:21] listen to the to the this
[1:25:23] listen to listen to the tips
[1:25:26] shouting
[1:25:28] listen
[1:25:31] listen to the tips not just one
[1:25:35] listen
[1:25:38] then what happened
[1:25:40] after they shot him
[1:25:42] and listened and obeyed the voice of the
[1:25:45] Prophet what happened they started
[1:25:49] the oil started multiplying
[1:25:52] I can imagine the neighbors who entered
[1:25:54] them the vessels
[1:25:56] what is happening
[1:25:58] these people have been so poor and what
[1:26:01] is happening and why were they borrowing
[1:26:03] the vessels
[1:26:05] but now we can see vessels being taken
[1:26:08] out full of oil full of oil full of oil
[1:26:11] whatever that was being happy whatever
[1:26:13] that was happening in private in the
[1:26:16] closet now the testimony where that came
[1:26:20] out was different
[1:26:23] if you shot in my brother if he was
[1:26:25] chatting and I'll pay the boys when you
[1:26:28] come out the results will be different
[1:26:35] the neighbors will have a different
[1:26:37] testimony
[1:26:39] may God help us
[1:26:41] are we ready to listen to The Voice
[1:26:44] the voice is on the Run
[1:26:46] the voices on the land
[1:26:49] our limitation is listening to The Voice
[1:26:55] may God help us
[1:26:58] so
[1:27:00] poro
[1:27:02] not just a few bottle
[1:27:06] I can imagine the neighbor saying what
[1:27:09] is happening
[1:27:10] is there a factory in this house
[1:27:15] they didn't know what was happening but
[1:27:18] by shutting themselves inside and
[1:27:20] obeying the voice of the Prophet a
[1:27:23] miracle happened
[1:27:25] we want Miracles but we don't want to
[1:27:27] obey the voice
[1:27:31] God help us
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] now
[1:27:37] Elijah had the anointing of canceling
[1:27:40] the debts let's read to the next verse
[1:27:42] okay
[1:27:44] verse 5. so she went from him and shut
[1:27:47] the door upon her and upon her sons who
[1:27:51] brought the vessels to her and she
[1:27:53] brought out and it came to pass when the
[1:27:56] vessels were full that she said unto her
[1:27:59] son bring me yet a vessel and he said
[1:28:02] unto her there is not a vessel more and
[1:28:06] the oil State then she came and told the
[1:28:09] man of God and he said go sell the oil
[1:28:13] and pay the debt
[1:28:15] foreign
[1:28:17] we are talking about debt consolation
[1:28:21] she had the depth that was not hers
[1:28:25] but now the voice of the Prophet
[1:28:28] provided a solution
[1:28:31] go under sir pay off the debt and live
[1:28:35] on what remains
[1:28:39] we can visit free
[1:28:41] from the depth
[1:28:43] we can be set free
[1:28:45] if we can obey the voice of the prophet
[1:28:51] in the absence of Elijah the prophet we
[1:28:54] have the spirit of Elijah we have the
[1:28:58] voice on depths we have the voice on
[1:29:02] depths and and books
[1:29:05] the limitation is
[1:29:10] the limitation is you
[1:29:15] what help us
[1:29:17] so the voice of
[1:29:22] the prophet
[1:29:24] has the power to cancel your debts
[1:29:30] whatever depth you have
[1:29:33] the voice of the Prophet has the power
[1:29:36] to cancel all your attempts and you can
[1:29:40] be free
[1:29:43] the limitation is you
[1:29:48] don't blame the pastor don't foreign
[1:29:51] it is you
[1:29:54] the prophet asked her what do you have
[1:29:55] in the house
[1:29:58] remember I asked that question if you
[1:30:01] are if you are accused of being a
[1:30:03] Christian can they find something
[1:30:05] that they can convict you with
[1:30:09] yeah
[1:30:10] so here the prophet said what do you
[1:30:12] have in the house
[1:30:14] what do you have
[1:30:18] we have books on the shelves
[1:30:22] or maybe you can say Okay I I have
[1:30:25] nothing but at least I've been baptized
[1:30:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:30] then the prophets oh that is our Goods
[1:30:32] so you are half obeyed ABS 2 38. then
[1:30:35] already that is a good step
[1:30:37] oh yes
[1:30:40] oh
[1:30:41] what do you have in the house
[1:30:43] at least I created time to listen to the
[1:30:46] message
[1:30:47] at least I create time to read a
[1:30:50] scripture
[1:30:52] that is what you have
[1:30:56] and you have it you have it even in your
[1:30:58] on your phones
[1:31:02] you can listen
[1:31:04] so that when you are asked what do you
[1:31:06] have at least you can quote something
[1:31:08] that you had yesterday
[1:31:12] or at least you can quote a scripture
[1:31:14] that you had yesterday you read
[1:31:16] yesterday or even today
[1:31:19] may God help us
[1:31:21] our prayer lives are limited because we
[1:31:25] don't listen to the message
[1:31:30] what happens listen to it
[1:31:33] listen even if it comes it condemns you
[1:31:36] listen listen anyhow
[1:31:39] let it condemn you that is the voice of
[1:31:42] the trumpet for your release
[1:31:48] sleep on it
[1:31:50] even if you are not hearing what it is
[1:31:52] what whatever that is being said just
[1:31:54] put it on it creates an atmosphere
[1:32:04] listen to it
[1:32:07] it will change
[1:32:09] our time will come
[1:32:11] when you can say I've heard but now I
[1:32:15] see
[1:32:18] then you can say my eyes have been
[1:32:21] opened
[1:32:22] I have seen my year of release
[1:32:27] the Lord has declared unto me the year
[1:32:31] of release now I am free I am no longer
[1:32:36] slave
[1:32:39] whatever situation
[1:32:42] you can say I am free
[1:32:45] and you can be free
[1:32:48] why
[1:32:49] that's why God has sent the voice
[1:32:53] has sent us the message to declare our
[1:32:57] freedom
[1:33:00] if you are if you hear it
[1:33:02] accept it
[1:33:04] what happens all your sins are
[1:33:07] demolished yes
[1:33:08] and they are taking in the sea of
[1:33:10] forgetfulness
[1:33:14] or you can sight me around you can turn
[1:33:17] me up upside down trying to to to to to
[1:33:21] to to fish those sins or anything that
[1:33:24] you know about me you can try always to
[1:33:27] to fish them so that you publish them
[1:33:34] and this is the only time
[1:33:36] the voice The Voice has said you never
[1:33:40] sinned even in the first place
[1:33:42] why because of the Lord's release
[1:33:47] the Lord's release has come in our day
[1:33:50] for what to declare that you are free
[1:33:53] your freedom has come
[1:33:56] so your freedom is here
[1:33:59] now it is your responsibility

[1:39:09] what a wonderful lesson tonight
[1:39:12] if we want to be free we can be free
[1:39:15] that trumpet has sounded you know
[1:39:18] brother Bradham brings it out so clearly
[1:39:19] I feel like I could just start right now
[1:39:21] are we good for an hour
[1:39:24] why to think about it though when that
[1:39:26] trumpets blown you're given the
[1:39:28] opportunity to go free and you can
[1:39:30] choose to stay sometimes Masters are
[1:39:32] very nice to the slaves very nice they
[1:39:36] look after them they look after their
[1:39:37] children they make Provisions for them
[1:39:39] sometimes people they just don't want to
[1:39:42] leave their masters because they're
[1:39:44] comfortable things are absolutely looked
[1:39:47] after and you know what brother Branham
[1:39:49] says we know it's in the Bible if they
[1:39:50] refuse that trumpet call to refuse that
[1:39:54] trumpet call means you're taken down to
[1:39:56] the temple not just anywhere to the
[1:39:58] temple and you're bored in the ear with
[1:40:00] an awl to Mark you so that you can never
[1:40:04] be free from that point forwards and
[1:40:07] brother Branham says you know what's
[1:40:09] happening when you hear preaching if you
[1:40:11] refuse that voice that trumpet call in
[1:40:13] that voice then you will be spiritually
[1:40:16] bored in the ear and you will not be
[1:40:19] able to hear that voice you will remain
[1:40:22] a Slave
[1:40:23] if you've heard that voice if you've
[1:40:25] heard that trumpet brothers and sisters
