[37:00] because you're going to participate in
[37:02] it and the old drug get crossed but just
[37:04] before I do it I just want to tell
[37:06] a very quick story
[37:08] um I've always heard this song this
[37:10] old-time game but it made the most
[37:13] meaning to me some years ago when a
[37:16] sister sang it after giving the
[37:18] testimony so back in Nigeria we had the
[37:20] sister had gone for the mandatory um
[37:23] they call it the youth service but it's
[37:25] like a paramilitary
[37:27] service three weeks being with soldiers
[37:32] teaching you stuff and women are
[37:34] actually required to wear trousers and
[37:36] she had to take a stand
[37:39] and many times she got an intention and
[37:43] got persecuted through those three weeks
[37:45] just because she took with Stanley she
[37:47] came and sang the special the older get
[37:49] dressed and when she got to the points
[37:51] where she said
[37:52] to The Old Rugged Cross I will ever be
[37:55] true
[37:56] it's shame and reproach glad to be a I
[38:00] realized that we all have a cross
[38:01] to carry we have a part in that Old
[38:04] Rugged Cross
[38:05] so we'll do this song to get out play
[38:07] the first verse you join in the chorus
[38:11] the strings will play the second verse
[38:13] you join all the chorus again and
[38:16] brother John on the guitar would play
[38:18] the third verse and you join on the
[38:19] chorus and then we'll just send it that
[38:21] way so let's participate

[1:02:20] that you would just take control father

[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:42] bless you this morning
[1:02:44] I just
[1:02:45] think it's a beautiful thing and I just
[1:02:47] want to say this while we're standing
[1:02:50] Psalms 100 maybe turn there with me
[1:02:53] Psalms 100 verse 1.
[1:02:56] we're not getting into this yet but
[1:02:58] we're gonna we're gonna go there
[1:03:03] we're going to talk about worship and
[1:03:04] we're going to really talk about it in
[1:03:06] the future
[1:03:07] but just hearing the worship this
[1:03:09] morning it just made me think brothers
[1:03:10] and sisters
[1:03:12] if we can't get excited here what blows
[1:03:16] our hair back in this world where do we
[1:03:18] go for excitement where do we go to
[1:03:20] shout
[1:03:21] where do we go to worship God
[1:03:24] where can we go
[1:03:27] Psalms 100 verse 1 says a Psalm of
[1:03:30] praise
[1:03:32] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye
[1:03:37] Lands
[1:03:39] let me just read to you what strongs
[1:03:42] says
[1:03:43] noise means
[1:03:46] a Joyful Noise
[1:03:49] the definition it says primitive root to
[1:03:51] Mar especially by breaking
[1:03:55] figuratively to split the ears
[1:04:00] some people want worship to be quiet
[1:04:03] some people want worship to be silent
[1:04:06] we just want to say Amen
[1:04:09] brothers and sisters all Heaven is going
[1:04:12] to be silent one day to hear you worship
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:17] can you imagine all of those beings
[1:04:20] created to worship God almighty
[1:04:24] they're gonna be silent to hear the
[1:04:26] redeemed praise because they don't know
[1:04:29] what it means to be redeemed
[1:04:31] oh my but when we understand what it
[1:04:33] means to be redeemed
[1:04:37] we're having a conversation do we need
[1:04:39] to wait until God heals us from cancer
[1:04:41] to be able to worship Him
[1:04:44] or can we jump up and down and scream
[1:04:47] and shout because we know that we have
[1:04:49] been saved from Death unto life
[1:04:55] because outside of his salvation
[1:04:57] brothers and sisters we're As Dead As
[1:04:58] Dead can be outside of the Holy Ghost In
[1:05:01] Our Lives whereas lost his lost can be
[1:05:04] that's who we are but boy oh boy when we
[1:05:07] have the Holy Ghost in our lives there
[1:05:09] ain't nobody on this side of Eternity
[1:05:11] that can worship like the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:13] Christ
[1:05:14] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:19] figuratively to split the ears with
[1:05:23] sound that is shout for alarm or joy
[1:05:27] remember the children of Israel when
[1:05:29] they circled the city they just crossed
[1:05:31] over Jordan they just got into the
[1:05:33] promised land they weren't going in with
[1:05:36] swords and staves they weren't going in
[1:05:38] with catapults and cannons they followed
[1:05:41] the word of the Lord and the word of the
[1:05:42] Lord says just shut your mouths for
[1:05:45] seven days six days March around that
[1:05:47] City and just be quiet but on the
[1:05:50] seventh day when you hear those priests
[1:05:52] shout when you hear the trumpets then
[1:05:54] you raise your voice and you split the
[1:05:57] ears of the enemy and the walls will
[1:05:59] come down
[1:06:00] [Applause]
[1:06:02] brothers and sisters if we want to see
[1:06:04] victory in our lives Shout to the Lord
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:10] shout for alarm or Joy blow an alarm cry
[1:06:14] alarm allowed out destroy Make a Joyful
[1:06:19] Noise smart shout for joy sound and
[1:06:23] alarm Triumph
[1:06:25] I believe when we worship brothers and
[1:06:27] sisters it's Triumph we are triumphing
[1:06:31] over the enemy
[1:06:34] we can talk about how Miriam beat the
[1:06:36] tambourine on the other side of the Red
[1:06:38] Sea knowing that they were gonna die if
[1:06:40] it wasn't for God and they got to the
[1:06:42] other side and they saw the horse and
[1:06:44] Riders floating dead in the water their
[1:06:47] enemies were dead
[1:06:50] she beat the tambourine
[1:06:53] how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] my goodness
[1:06:58] why
[1:07:00] God bless you this morning
[1:07:03] your worship does something
[1:07:08] just uh I'm sorry I missed you
[1:07:13] I missed being here
[1:07:15] I just thought about worshiping and just
[1:07:17] the beauty of it it's so wonderful to be
[1:07:19] able to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:07:22] and and we're going to get into worship
[1:07:24] but you know there's only one way that
[1:07:25] we can truly worship and that is in
[1:07:27] spirit and in truth and if you have
[1:07:29] followed the message for the hour for
[1:07:31] our day then you truly can receive the
[1:07:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit and outside
[1:07:34] of the holy spirit in your life brothers
[1:07:37] and sisters we're not really truly
[1:07:38] worshiping but boy when we worship in
[1:07:41] spirit with truth oh my something
[1:07:44] happens
[1:07:45] we don't remain the same
[1:07:48] turn with me this morning to Isaiah
[1:07:50] chapter 7. thank you musicians I'm sorry
[1:07:52] to keep you waiting here I just uh
[1:07:58] I just get a little excited too
[1:08:01] I just think it's wonderful
[1:08:03] you know there really only is two times
[1:08:05] that I'm aware of where Heaven is silent
[1:08:08] one of them is when he steps off the
[1:08:10] throat of intercession
[1:08:12] the silence in heaven for the space
[1:08:14] about a half an hour
[1:08:16] and the other time is when it comes time
[1:08:18] for the redeemed to worship God
[1:08:21] and to me that just does something that
[1:08:23] just that just says something for all
[1:08:25] heaven to be quiet only for two purposes
[1:08:28] two reasons my
[1:08:31] Isaiah chapter 7 I want to continue uh
[1:08:35] on with the thought we had last week
[1:08:38] about a super sign
[1:08:41] start with verse 10 of Isaiah chapter
[1:08:43] 7.
[1:08:45] moreover the Lord's Lord spake again
[1:08:47] unto ahaz saying
[1:08:49] ask the assign of the Lord thy God ask
[1:08:52] it either in the depth or in the height
[1:08:54] above
[1:08:56] but ahaz said I will not ask neither
[1:08:58] will I tempt the Lord
[1:09:00] isn't that interesting
[1:09:02] here we have a king in Israel
[1:09:04] he should be able to ask the Lord
[1:09:07] but he had condemnation in his heart
[1:09:09] there was something not right in his
[1:09:10] life brother Branham said that he was a
[1:09:12] backslider
[1:09:14] he was an evil King and and he couldn't
[1:09:17] ask the Lord and he knew it so he didn't
[1:09:19] dare
[1:09:20] and the Lord comes in verse 13 and
[1:09:23] doesn't address him in his condition he
[1:09:26] addresses the House of David the lineage
[1:09:28] of Christ and he said hear ye now o
[1:09:31] House of David is it a small thing for
[1:09:33] you to weary men but will ye weary My
[1:09:37] God also
[1:09:39] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:09:42] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:09:44] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:09:47] his name Emmanuel
[1:09:50] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:09:52] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[1:09:55] love you and we thank you thank you for
[1:09:58] the Liberty where your spirit is Lord
[1:10:00] Jesus because we know it's not just
[1:10:02] Liberty to shout and to sing and maybe
[1:10:05] to dance around but it's liberty to
[1:10:07] recognize that you truly have redeemed
[1:10:10] us
[1:10:11] father we love you and we thank you for
[1:10:13] that Liberty now we pray that Lord Jesus
[1:10:16] one more time you would take this word
[1:10:17] this this bread of life father and just
[1:10:20] break it open to us fresh once again
[1:10:22] Lord that spiritually speaking when we
[1:10:25] leave here today we would say that truly
[1:10:28] we were fed oh Lord Jesus not by Brother
[1:10:31] Barry but by truly the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] himself
[1:10:35] we love you and we thank you and we just
[1:10:37] commit the words that are spoken now the
[1:10:39] words that were read this Eternal Word
[1:10:41] into your hands now in Jesus Christ's
[1:10:44] name we pray amen God bless you this
[1:10:47] morning you may be seated
[1:10:50] as we had mentioned before
[1:10:53] um just as an announcement
[1:10:55] the odds are great if you're sitting
[1:10:58] towards the back of the of the sanctuary
[1:11:00] that the deacons will be pushing you
[1:11:02] forward inviting you to take a few seats
[1:11:04] forward we can see that this empty area
[1:11:07] is starting to fill up and that's
[1:11:08] wonderful but as we go we're going to
[1:11:10] need to continue to squish people in and
[1:11:13] and use as many seats as we can so just
[1:11:16] don't be upset or concerned if someone
[1:11:18] Taps you on the shoulder and invites you
[1:11:20] to just move up a little bit it's just
[1:11:21] because we need a little bit more space
[1:11:23] and especially for parents with small
[1:11:25] children it doesn't make any sense for
[1:11:27] children to be up in the front area I
[1:11:30] mean parents with small children that
[1:11:31] need to be taken out when they're upset
[1:11:33] and so we just want to leave the back
[1:11:36] rows open for parents with small
[1:11:38] children and uh just in
[1:11:40] ask that you won't be upset if we if we
[1:11:43] invite you to move
[1:11:45] next Sunday we've got a potluck coming
[1:11:47] up and I think it'll be a wonderful time
[1:11:50] on Fellowship once again
[1:11:52] at the end of the month we have special
[1:11:53] meetings with uh
[1:11:55] brother Ed Hamer Meister at end time
[1:11:57] message Tabernacle and our brothers and
[1:12:00] sisters who are here now some of them
[1:12:01] God bless you certainly good to see you
[1:12:03] brother John I haven't seen you since
[1:12:04] you've been married
[1:12:06] I trust married life is treating you
[1:12:07] well
[1:12:09] God bless you so yeah we have uh I think
[1:12:12] the meetings start on the 28th and go to
[1:12:14] the 30th and uh
[1:12:17] so yeah it'll be a wonderful time of
[1:12:18] Fellowship in Edmonton
[1:12:20] are you happy this morning
[1:12:22] out of this message the super sign
[1:12:25] um brother Branham he talks about how
[1:12:29] God chose in verse 14 of Isaiah chapter
[1:12:34] 7 therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:12:36] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:12:37] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:12:40] his name Emmanuel
[1:12:43] why did God choose a baby
[1:12:46] I'm probably going to repeat some of the
[1:12:48] stuff we talked about last week but her
[1:12:51] yeah it was last week it's amazing we uh
[1:12:55] yeah we put on some kilometers this last
[1:12:58] week thank you for your prayers by the
[1:12:59] way we had such a wonderful time we went
[1:13:02] to Yellowstone National Park and just
[1:13:04] camped out there spent two nights in the
[1:13:06] park and then drove home
[1:13:08] but took our time two days down and two
[1:13:11] days back and two days in the park it
[1:13:13] was just a just a real nice time
[1:13:16] um
[1:13:17] one of the things that we discovered
[1:13:18] which is good also is that everyone's
[1:13:22] used to have in their space and
[1:13:23] sometimes when you take people that are
[1:13:25] used to have in their space and put them
[1:13:26] into a confined space it can get a
[1:13:28] little bit tense
[1:13:29] and uh you know having a a camper is
[1:13:32] real nice but sometimes it's just not
[1:13:34] enough space
[1:13:36] but uh we had a wonderful time all in
[1:13:39] all and the Lord was just good to us we
[1:13:41] had so many traveling mercies I know you
[1:13:44] know I was thinking about it while I was
[1:13:45] driving I think we did about 2500
[1:13:47] kilometers and I know that's not many
[1:13:49] for some some have done way more
[1:13:51] kilometers I think brother Justice is
[1:13:53] probably got the record for kilometers
[1:13:55] in our congregation here but
[1:13:57] some people have done many many
[1:13:59] kilometers and I just was thinking while
[1:14:00] we were driving you know how many times
[1:14:02] does the Angels encamped about those who
[1:14:05] fear Him actually jump between Vehicles
[1:14:08] right on that Center Line and just
[1:14:10] create a grease to slide the vehicles
[1:14:13] past one another when otherwise there
[1:14:15] could be a clip or a head-on collision
[1:14:17] there were so many times where I thought
[1:14:19] my goodness I can't believe people are
[1:14:22] driving the way they were and you know
[1:14:24] maybe people say that about me too and
[1:14:25] that's why I was saying that I don't
[1:14:27] know but
[1:14:28] it just is amazing when you think about
[1:14:30] his faithfulness isn't it
[1:14:33] and how many times in our lives do we do
[1:14:36] we experience things that we don't even
[1:14:38] experience
[1:14:41] we just have his grace and his mercy and
[1:14:43] and somehow we just remain safe and and
[1:14:46] and secure and and healthy and alive
[1:14:49] it's just amazing
[1:14:52] thank you for your prayers we covet them
[1:14:54] we need our each other's prayers don't
[1:14:56] we that's what the body does is praise
[1:14:59] for one another and that's why it's
[1:15:01] important to be a part of a body and and
[1:15:03] to separate ourselves from a body it
[1:15:05] just means uh it does no good
[1:15:07] but uh anyways talking about our our our
[1:15:10] message is out of super sign I believe
[1:15:13] it's in 1962. uh sorry it's 1959. it's
[1:15:18] 12 27 m a super sign
[1:15:22] and uh brother bradhamy talks about it
[1:15:24] in this message over and over he just
[1:15:26] takes the time to continually ask the
[1:15:28] question why a baby why would God the
[1:15:31] the almighty Creator the one that
[1:15:33] created the heavens and the Earth why
[1:15:35] would he choose a baby for a sign and he
[1:15:39] explains there's many different signs in
[1:15:42] the Bible many different examples of
[1:15:43] signs in paragraph 69 he says I think
[1:15:47] that God had in his mind
[1:15:50] it would be appealing to the human being
[1:15:54] did you think about that
[1:15:55] I don't know how many people listen to
[1:15:57] this message but I I just can't get away
[1:15:59] from it how God would know that this is
[1:16:02] appealing to the human mind something
[1:16:04] about this causes a curiosity in the
[1:16:07] human mind he says it is to the believer
[1:16:10] the unbeliever doesn't care the
[1:16:12] make-believer they might think about it
[1:16:14] a little bit and maybe find something to
[1:16:16] criticize instead and just be distracted
[1:16:18] but the believer the believer is the one
[1:16:21] that says that attracts me there's
[1:16:23] something about that that I just can't
[1:16:24] get away from it's appealing when our
[1:16:27] God becomes one of us
[1:16:31] he doesn't become an angel and he
[1:16:33] doesn't become a great superhuman he
[1:16:36] just becomes an ordinary every day one
[1:16:38] of us
[1:16:40] isn't that amazing to think
[1:16:44] now some people would say brother Barry
[1:16:45] Jesus wasn't an ordinary every day one
[1:16:48] of us
[1:16:49] and 100 percent
[1:16:51] but this is what God was trying to do he
[1:16:53] was trying to express himself in his
[1:16:56] creation and brother Branham talks about
[1:16:58] it how he came as a baby why did he come
[1:17:00] as a baby so that he could actually grow
[1:17:03] up as a baby here come into this world
[1:17:04] as a baby nobody would ever say that you
[1:17:07] didn't come into this world as a baby
[1:17:08] you don't understand what it means to be
[1:17:09] hungry
[1:17:10] you don't understand what it means to
[1:17:12] actually desire attention and to have to
[1:17:14] cry he said when that baby cried that
[1:17:17] wasn't just Jesus a different man crying
[1:17:19] he said that was mighty Jehovah crying
[1:17:21] that was God crying in a baby
[1:17:26] and when we hear it in the Bible that he
[1:17:27] was tempted in all points all manners
[1:17:33] I've been marveling at the thought you
[1:17:35] know if if that's true and it is I'm not
[1:17:37] saying if it isn't but I'm just saying
[1:17:39] it to illustrate it if that's true then
[1:17:41] by the age 33 typically we probably have
[1:17:44] already been tempted every way that we
[1:17:46] could is that right
[1:17:49] 33 years old that's where he was
[1:17:51] crucified that's where he was murdered
[1:17:54] but it was for a purpose it wasn't just
[1:17:56] a terrible news story that came out that
[1:17:59] you know suddenly this great man with
[1:18:01] this great healing campaign was just
[1:18:03] crucified and murdered and now you know
[1:18:05] the church doesn't know what's going to
[1:18:06] happen no it wasn't that at all it was
[1:18:09] so that Mighty Creator could come down
[1:18:11] and be like Boaz he could be that near
[1:18:14] Kinsmen Redeemer the one who actually
[1:18:17] was part of the family and how can that
[1:18:20] be you have to have his DNA you got to
[1:18:23] be part of him he has to be part of you
[1:18:25] in order for him to be the Kinsmen
[1:18:27] Redeemer but to think brother random
[1:18:29] talks in this message he says it how he
[1:18:31] came as a baby he cried as a baby he
[1:18:33] knew what it meant to be a baby and then
[1:18:35] he knew what it meant to be a toddler
[1:18:36] and then he knew what it meant to be a
[1:18:38] teenager to go through the teenage years
[1:18:40] he experienced that
[1:18:43] I wonder if he ever talked back to his
[1:18:45] parents
[1:18:46] I wouldn't say that he did but I
[1:18:48] wouldn't say that he didn't because he
[1:18:50] was tempted in all points
[1:18:52] and I would say this even if he did he
[1:18:54] would probably say mama I'm really sorry
[1:18:57] will you forgive me because I shouldn't
[1:18:59] have talked to you that way he will
[1:19:01] always come subject to the word wouldn't
[1:19:02] he because he was the word
[1:19:05] the word made flesh
[1:19:07] no don't don't don't get upset I'm not
[1:19:09] trying to say things I'm just trying to
[1:19:11] just explore in in thoughts he was Jesus
[1:19:14] Christ and and he was God it wasn't just
[1:19:18] Jesus Christ another man it was God
[1:19:19] Almighty manifest in flesh it wasn't
[1:19:23] Joseph's Gene it wasn't Mary's egg it
[1:19:27] was Mary's womb that's all he chose to
[1:19:29] borrow a womb God chose to borrow a womb
[1:19:32] so that he could bring together and
[1:19:34] fertilize that egg inside that womb
[1:19:37] um
[1:19:38] the Immaculate Conception brother random
[1:19:40] says it in here talk about Immaculate
[1:19:41] Conception perfection
[1:19:43] created in the womb that he borrowed
[1:19:46] and and and and the punch line today
[1:19:48] brothers and sisters same as it was last
[1:19:50] time the womb that he wants to borrow
[1:19:51] today is yours he wants our spiritual
[1:19:54] womb that teeny little place that that
[1:19:56] brother Branham said it's only in the
[1:19:58] human heart no other animal on Earth has
[1:20:00] that little space that was
[1:20:02] scientifically proven
[1:20:04] but that place was created God created
[1:20:06] that place the mighty Creator he made
[1:20:08] one little spot in the heart of a human
[1:20:11] for his spirit
[1:20:13] and you know without that then we just
[1:20:16] received the mark of the beast which is
[1:20:18] terrible
[1:20:20] we come into this world speaking lies
[1:20:22] we were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:20:25] and that's why brothers and sisters by
[1:20:27] default if we don't accept the mark of
[1:20:28] the the baptism of the Holy Spirit then
[1:20:31] we just automatically have the mark of
[1:20:32] the beast
[1:20:33] as a baby we have the mark of the beast
[1:20:35] some people might want to debate that or
[1:20:37] get upset by that but don't worry just
[1:20:39] get the Holy Ghost and you don't have
[1:20:40] the mark of the beast that's the only
[1:20:42] solution to it
[1:20:44] paragraph 69 I think that when God had
[1:20:46] in his mind it would be appealing to the
[1:20:48] human being it is to the believer it is
[1:20:51] appealing when our God becomes one of us
[1:20:54] but to the starchy ungodly
[1:20:57] stumbling block
[1:21:00] we know that that's when they picked up
[1:21:01] Stones when Jesus said I am my father
[1:21:02] are one that's when they wanted to Stone
[1:21:04] him when he started to declare that they
[1:21:06] loved his healing campaign they loved
[1:21:07] the first and second pull of his
[1:21:08] ministry but boy oh boy
[1:21:10] you start making yourself God look out
[1:21:12] same thing today brothers and sisters
[1:21:14] when we start to say exactly what
[1:21:15] brother Gilbert's been saying what all
[1:21:17] the other Ministry have been saying I
[1:21:18] and my father are one when we truly get
[1:21:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:21:21] Lives we're no longer ourselves
[1:21:24] he's not going to say I'm just going to
[1:21:26] co-exist with you we're going to have a
[1:21:27] cohabitation in your body no it's going
[1:21:30] to be a dying out to ourselves so that
[1:21:32] he can live
[1:21:35] it's appealing when our God becomes one
[1:21:37] of us but to the starchy ungodly a
[1:21:40] stumbling block
[1:21:41] I'll give you a sign of Virgin shall
[1:21:43] conceive I want to say this today every
[1:21:46] single one who has the ability to
[1:21:48] receive this message of the hour is a
[1:21:50] virgin
[1:21:51] because only a virgin to this word is
[1:21:54] going to be able to be that one that's
[1:21:57] all I'll give you a sign of Virgin shall
[1:22:00] conceive Emmanuel will be with you and
[1:22:04] we know that Jesus said I will be with
[1:22:06] you
[1:22:07] even in you to the end of the world
[1:22:12] I'll give you the sign a virgin shall
[1:22:14] conceive Emmanuel will be with you god
[1:22:17] thought it would appeal to the human
[1:22:18] race that our God would be one of us
[1:22:23] that he would cross himself and become
[1:22:25] our dust that he would become our stock
[1:22:29] a human stock
[1:22:32] the Creator who made all things
[1:22:36] the one who created the seasons who
[1:22:39] created life who created the blade of
[1:22:41] grass brother Bradham talks about a god
[1:22:43] hiding himself in Simplicity and
[1:22:45] revealing himself in the same
[1:22:48] most people want to see some some great
[1:22:50] scientific things some sort of evidence
[1:22:54] but it's not even there he he's right
[1:22:56] there he's everywhere where we wherever
[1:22:57] we look
[1:23:01] brother Branham says and again it
[1:23:03] fulfilled prophecy
[1:23:05] the prophets had sought
[1:23:07] and another thing
[1:23:09] the word
[1:23:10] was made dust flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:23:14] the Jehovah the word became human
[1:23:18] became dust and tabernacled with us
[1:23:21] everlasting sign shall never end
[1:23:24] oh when we think of it
[1:23:27] an eternal sign
[1:23:29] the super signs of all sign
[1:23:32] God becoming one of us
[1:23:35] and why did he become one of us brothers
[1:23:37] and sisters
[1:23:39] so that we could become him
[1:23:42] so that we could become him but to some
[1:23:45] people that's a stumbling block
[1:23:47] to say oh you go make yourself God how
[1:23:49] can you be God
[1:23:51] because he said it
[1:23:54] and you know that's not just me saying
[1:23:56] that's not just me saying that brother
[1:23:57] Branham said it let's just turn on our
[1:23:58] Bibles
[1:24:00] let's turn over to Colossians chapter
[1:24:02] one
[1:24:05] this is a scripture near and dear to me
[1:24:07] in my heart
[1:24:08] my pastor as I
[1:24:11] was being raised he spoke on this many
[1:24:13] many times and it truly is
[1:24:17] I believe the the Keystone for our our
[1:24:20] day the Revelation for our day there's
[1:24:23] many Revelations and many days but today
[1:24:27] is what we're talking about
[1:24:30] Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the
[1:24:33] mystery which hath been hid from ages
[1:24:35] and from Generations
[1:24:37] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:24:41] how has it made manifest to his Saints
[1:24:43] through a prophet
[1:24:45] through a prophetic utterance through
[1:24:46] God choosing a man and raising him up so
[1:24:49] that he could speak through that man a
[1:24:51] man that would be completely surrendered
[1:24:54] verse 27 to whom God
[1:24:57] would make known what is the riches of
[1:24:59] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:25:01] Gentiles
[1:25:03] which is Christ in you
[1:25:05] the hope of glory
[1:25:08] it's got to be Christ in US brothers and
[1:25:11] sisters
[1:25:12] outside of that we're going to be just
[1:25:15] like every other Gentile
[1:25:17] and and I think maybe even almost
[1:25:19] miserable because we'll be wanting to
[1:25:22] get that far but not maybe going all of
[1:25:24] the way to get that that that place
[1:25:27] where he is in us but boy when we get
[1:25:29] there I just I just think it's beautiful
[1:25:30] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:25:32] there is Liberty then it becomes easy to
[1:25:34] worship we don't care about what's going
[1:25:36] on around us we just want him to hear
[1:25:38] our voice you know brother rather be
[1:25:40] tells that story about seeing King
[1:25:41] George come through in Canada and how
[1:25:44] how the people were there and they're
[1:25:45] all waving their flags and they're so
[1:25:47] happy to see the king as he goes by and
[1:25:49] that one little kid was upset and and
[1:25:52] and they said why are you upset didn't
[1:25:55] you see the king and the kid said yeah I
[1:25:57] did see the king well why are you upset
[1:25:59] because he didn't see me
[1:26:02] that's what we want to do is just make
[1:26:04] sure that he sees me
[1:26:06] we don't come to church to be seen we
[1:26:09] don't come to church to see if we're
[1:26:11] doing that brothers and sisters stop it
[1:26:13] it's the wrong reason
[1:26:16] we're not coming to church for the right
[1:26:17] reason
[1:26:18] if there's something that we want to
[1:26:20] come and critique and criticize
[1:26:21] continually stop it that's not the
[1:26:24] spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is
[1:26:27] going to be subject to the word of God
[1:26:29] and the word of God is just going to
[1:26:30] raise worship to Jesus Christ to
[1:26:33] recognize what he's done for us like I
[1:26:35] said earlier do we do we need to be
[1:26:36] healed of something terrible in our
[1:26:38] lives to be able to Worship On
[1:26:41] or do we really recognize what he's done
[1:26:43] for us
[1:26:44] outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] outside of this free gift of Salvation
[1:26:48] in our day
[1:26:50] we would be done
[1:26:53] we'd have no hope
[1:26:57] I just think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:27:01] you know Jesus he thought it not robbery
[1:27:03] for him to be equal with God
[1:27:06] and brothers and sisters it's the same
[1:27:08] thing for us today
[1:27:10] we've got to recognize that we don't
[1:27:12] think it's robbery to consider ourselves
[1:27:15] equal with God not because we have the
[1:27:17] ability to create not because we can do
[1:27:19] anything on our own it's because he
[1:27:21] chose us in him before the foundation of
[1:27:22] the world that we should be before him
[1:27:24] holy and Without Blame
[1:27:27] as a part of him if we're a part of him
[1:27:29] then we're co-equal with him
[1:27:31] it's the position that Satan wants so
[1:27:34] desperately and thinks that one day he's
[1:27:36] going to get it and doesn't believe that
[1:27:38] we have that position or any Authority
[1:27:41] that goes with it
[1:27:43] but it's just such a beautiful thing
[1:27:47] he chose us in him
[1:27:50] and we know that we've talked about it
[1:27:51] in the book of Ephesians Ephesians
[1:27:54] chapter
[1:27:55] five
[1:27:56] the scripture verse 32 this is a great
[1:27:59] mystery but I speak concerning Christ in
[1:28:02] the church he talks about the roles and
[1:28:04] how a husband needs to have the wife and
[1:28:07] the wife needs to reverence her husband
[1:28:09] and and the children need to obey the
[1:28:11] parents and Paul is telling the church
[1:28:13] in Ephesians in the Ephesian church that
[1:28:16] you know this is a great mystery but
[1:28:17] even though we're talking about natural
[1:28:19] things we're not we're not actually
[1:28:21] trying to express natural things we're
[1:28:23] talking about the the supernatural
[1:28:25] things and and this is the mystery
[1:28:27] concerning Christ and his church that he
[1:28:30] desires to actually take a bride of his
[1:28:32] own choosing not not just actually have
[1:28:35] someone who is just going to be with him
[1:28:37] and and like I said earlier cohabitate
[1:28:40] that's not it at all he wants to become
[1:28:42] one with his bride
[1:28:45] but that takes a relationship
[1:28:47] and it takes submission it takes
[1:28:49] surrender
[1:28:50] we talked about roles and and how the
[1:28:53] wives
[1:28:54] are supposed to submit themselves to
[1:28:56] their husbands
[1:28:57] and that's a tough thing to do in these
[1:28:59] days because in this world the woman
[1:29:01] especially the wife is actually promoted
[1:29:04] to the position of authority in the home
[1:29:07] and that's the way the world is created
[1:29:09] that's the way movies are that's the way
[1:29:11] TV shows are that's the way music is the
[1:29:13] woman is strong she has Authority she
[1:29:16] has power but you know what that's not
[1:29:18] what the word of God says the word of
[1:29:20] God says that the woman submits herself
[1:29:23] unto her own husband as unto the Lord
[1:29:27] and that's really it's such a paradox
[1:29:31] but when a woman can do that
[1:29:33] it's only because a man can do it to God
[1:29:36] she sees the husband do it
[1:29:39] to his husband
[1:29:41] I'm going down a road that I'd only want
[1:29:43] to get too far down but it's just a
[1:29:44] wonderful thing to recognize that a man
[1:29:46] and a woman can come together and be in
[1:29:48] one mind and one Accord and it's the
[1:29:50] same thing concerning Christ in his
[1:29:51] church
[1:29:52] brother Branham talks about the uniting
[1:29:54] of spirit and flesh my goodness I don't
[1:29:57] do this often but I need to today
[1:30:01] bye
[1:30:03] brother Branham he talks about this
[1:30:05] paragraph 71 then again he must be the
[1:30:08] Seed of Abraham talking about Jesus and
[1:30:10] his lineage his position Abraham of
[1:30:13] course was the seed of Eve was the
[1:30:16] woman's seed that was to bruise the
[1:30:18] Serpent's head but Abraham if you can
[1:30:21] catch it he had faith in God
[1:30:25] which United the spirit of God with the
[1:30:29] Flesh of man
[1:30:30] this one stopped me in my tracks
[1:30:32] brothers and sisters this is why I'm
[1:30:33] talking about this and and laboring on
[1:30:36] it
[1:30:37] so many points in this message talking
[1:30:40] about Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:30:42] understanding that we need to become one
[1:30:44] with the Lord Jesus it's not about us
[1:30:47] having our own independence and and our
[1:30:49] own opinion and saying well I can take
[1:30:52] part of the message and I'll leave the
[1:30:53] other part of the message and and I I'm
[1:30:56] strong enough I can I can discern what I
[1:30:58] need for me and my house you know uh the
[1:31:01] word of God says as for me in my house
[1:31:03] will serve the Lord
[1:31:05] now the only way we're going to serve
[1:31:06] the Lord truly in our days according to
[1:31:08] the message of the hour we can say that
[1:31:10] we're going to serve it according to our
[1:31:11] Traditions according to maybe a
[1:31:13] denominational teaching but that's not
[1:31:15] going to give us the results that we
[1:31:17] think it will
[1:31:18] but Abraham he had a revelation didn't
[1:31:21] he his Revelation was that he had the
[1:31:24] ability to have faith and it was a
[1:31:26] supernatural Faith how could he have
[1:31:27] faith he was given the promise that he
[1:31:29] would have a son
[1:31:31] God came and talked to him he had that
[1:31:34] relationship with him and he didn't ask
[1:31:36] for it God came and said to him hey
[1:31:39] Abram get up
[1:31:41] get away from your family leave the land
[1:31:43] of her go and follow me follow me I'll
[1:31:47] tell you where to go just get up and
[1:31:48] March and sometimes in our lives we have
[1:31:50] that direction in our lives or we need
[1:31:52] to do that as well but he was given that
[1:31:55] he had something inside of him we know
[1:31:57] it was a supernatural seed it was that
[1:31:59] Faith Gene seed of God brother Branham
[1:32:02] says but Abraham if you catch it he had
[1:32:04] faith in God which United the spirit of
[1:32:08] God with the Flesh of man
[1:32:12] I just want to labor on that for a
[1:32:14] little bit brothers and sisters because
[1:32:15] if we have faith it's going to unite the
[1:32:19] spirit of God with our flesh it's going
[1:32:23] to unite us together as one and how do
[1:32:25] we get Faith we know Faith cometh by
[1:32:28] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[1:32:31] so the more we listen the more faith we
[1:32:34] get whether we feel it or not whether we
[1:32:36] understand it or not it's not an
[1:32:38] emotional experience
[1:32:41] you know brother Branham he says it that
[1:32:42] uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:45] without sensation
[1:32:47] and it is without sensation it's not a
[1:32:49] feeling that we get that's why Mary
[1:32:50] never had a sensation brother Branham
[1:32:52] talks about that in the message of the
[1:32:54] hour he explains that very clearly I'm
[1:32:55] not sure what the message is but he says
[1:32:57] it very clearly there was no relation
[1:32:59] between a man and a woman there was no
[1:33:01] sensation it was just simply at Thy word
[1:33:03] be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:33:05] behold the handmaid of the Lord and when
[1:33:08] we have the ability to believe it unites
[1:33:10] that Faith with the spirit of God with
[1:33:13] our flesh it changes us it allows us to
[1:33:16] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:33:18] brother Bradham goes on to say there is
[1:33:20] where the faith come there is why he
[1:33:23] could be this Abraham seed not all flesh
[1:33:26] but the uniting of spirit and flesh
[1:33:29] together
[1:33:31] god making himself tearing out rooting
[1:33:35] out all evil bringing into submission
[1:33:37] the flesh the dust that he created and
[1:33:40] live with you as a partner once again he
[1:33:44] goes from talking about Abraham out
[1:33:46] there and the story of Abraham and how
[1:33:48] that would happen but then he just
[1:33:49] brings it right down to the end to say
[1:33:50] you to live in you
[1:33:52] that he could he created to live with
[1:33:55] you as a partner and that's what all
[1:33:57] this is about brothers and sisters it's
[1:33:59] not about the stories and and the types
[1:34:01] it's all about you and understanding
[1:34:03] even in 1959 brother Branham is talking
[1:34:05] about the uniting time and sign the
[1:34:08] super sign the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:34:10] descending out of heaven with a shout
[1:34:13] with a voice
[1:34:15] of the Archangel and the Trump of God
[1:34:18] and we know that's where we're at but in
[1:34:20] 1959 he was talking this way I think
[1:34:23] it's just beautiful
[1:34:24] when we look at this it's it's just
[1:34:26] exactly where we are today and and to
[1:34:29] think about this when we have that
[1:34:31] ability to believe when you have that
[1:34:33] ability to believe don't ever discount
[1:34:34] it brothers and sisters
[1:34:36] sometimes we get down in our flesh
[1:34:38] sometimes we get emotionally sick
[1:34:42] sometimes we get emotionally weak
[1:34:46] sometimes we get frustrated sometimes we
[1:34:49] get confused sometimes we have all these
[1:34:51] different things that happen in our
[1:34:53] lives sometimes we'll get physically
[1:34:54] sick but don't don't don't be wary and
[1:34:57] well doing
[1:34:58] don't lose your faith
[1:35:00] I'll say this if you have truly been
[1:35:03] called before the foundation of the
[1:35:05] world you can't lose your faith
[1:35:07] sometimes we get a little
[1:35:11] about morale he'll wait till we're down
[1:35:12] he won't come and try and get us when
[1:35:14] we're on the Mountaintop he'll come when
[1:35:15] when we're down when we're tired when
[1:35:17] we're frustrated when we're emotionally
[1:35:19] charged one way or the other that's when
[1:35:21] Satan's gonna come around and you know
[1:35:23] when he comes around if we can recognize
[1:35:25] his tactics we can just say get lost you
[1:35:28] know what I rebuke you in the name of
[1:35:29] Jesus Christ you have no part in me and
[1:35:31] he has to go if we submit ourselves
[1:35:33] therefore unto God then resist the devil
[1:35:35] he has to flee that's the way it works
[1:35:37] we don't flee from Satan he flees from
[1:35:39] us he has to
[1:35:41] but when we do that brothers and sisters
[1:35:43] the uniting of spirit and flesh together
[1:35:46] god making himself I just love the way
[1:35:48] he says this tearing out rooting out
[1:35:51] Evil Jesus never had any evil
[1:35:54] he didn't need to tear out all the
[1:35:56] insides of him he didn't have to die out
[1:35:58] to himself he had to go to the Cross he
[1:36:01] recognized that but he didn't have any
[1:36:03] sin inside of him that he had to root
[1:36:05] out that he had to tear out that he had
[1:36:06] to clean out he's talking about us
[1:36:09] brothers and sisters we need to do that
[1:36:10] work we need to be willing to tear it
[1:36:12] all out to tear it all down to say be it
[1:36:15] unto me according to Thy word if there's
[1:36:16] something in my life Lord that's
[1:36:18] displeasing unto you then reveal it to
[1:36:20] me show me Lord so that we can make it
[1:36:22] right and go forwards
[1:36:25] bringing into submission the flesh
[1:36:28] the dust that he created and live with
[1:36:31] you as a partner I think that's just
[1:36:33] amazing
[1:36:34] we have been given the ability to live
[1:36:37] with him as a partner in our lives if
[1:36:39] we're willing to believe if we're
[1:36:40] willing to just accept the word that
[1:36:42] we've been given in our day
[1:36:45] I apologize if this is just maybe real
[1:36:48] Elementary and and it's not real deep
[1:36:51] but it's just the way God's revealed it
[1:36:53] to me and I think it's so amazing to
[1:36:55] recognize that all we need to do is
[1:36:57] believe brothers and sisters and when we
[1:36:59] believe we'll listen and when we believe
[1:37:00] and listen then that that spirit will
[1:37:03] come around and Unite with our faith and
[1:37:06] that will change our flesh and one of
[1:37:08] these days you know what's going to
[1:37:10] happen we are going home when this
[1:37:12] church recognizes what it is and I want
[1:37:17] to say it brothers and sisters because I
[1:37:19] know Satan hates it and that's why I
[1:37:20] want to say it when the church
[1:37:21] recognizes that she is one with Christ
[1:37:24] that she is the second coming literal
[1:37:27] coming of Jesus Christ on earth when she
[1:37:30] recognizes that then the Rapture is
[1:37:32] going to go
[1:37:34] and Satan's time is over because as soon
[1:37:36] as the bride goes up Satan's cast down
[1:37:38] and you know we're not going to be here
[1:37:41] we don't want to be here when that time
[1:37:42] comes we were just like I said we were
[1:37:45] in Yellowstone and I'm not going to give
[1:37:47] you a lesson on Yellowstone but for
[1:37:48] those people who don't know it it's a
[1:37:49] super volcano they say and the whole
[1:37:51] entire thing is just a crater of a
[1:37:54] volcano and it's so amazing if you've
[1:37:56] never seen it you get the opportunity I
[1:37:58] think it's it's tremendous to see it and
[1:38:00] I trust by God's grace if we're still
[1:38:02] here that nothing can happen to his
[1:38:04] bride there will be no surprises so if
[1:38:06] you go there I don't think you need to
[1:38:07] worry about that volcano erupting but we
[1:38:10] never want to tempt God either I'm sure
[1:38:12] if it's erupting we'll never go there
[1:38:14] but to think about it how it's thousands
[1:38:17] and thousands of years old millions of
[1:38:19] years old they would say and you know
[1:38:21] what I would almost agree with them
[1:38:22] because you drive up the mountain those
[1:38:24] people that have been there you got to
[1:38:25] go way up over top of a mountain then
[1:38:27] you come down to like a Great Meadow and
[1:38:29] it's huge it's like a ginormous metal
[1:38:32] and what it is is the Caldera it's the
[1:38:34] bowl of the volcano and there's a lake
[1:38:36] there and there's Meadows there and
[1:38:38] there's a river that runs through it and
[1:38:40] oh manner of different things but
[1:38:41] underneath
[1:38:43] is magma
[1:38:44] a giant bowl of magma underneath it and
[1:38:48] and on top of it it's beautiful there's
[1:38:50] birds singing There's butterflies
[1:38:51] there's Buffalo there's elk there's
[1:38:54] birds
[1:38:55] the the trees the grass the flowers
[1:38:58] everything is so Serene it's so
[1:39:01] beautiful on top and thousands and
[1:39:03] thousands of years of of just nothing
[1:39:06] happening just allowing it to grow and
[1:39:09] Go Back To Nature is what's happened and
[1:39:11] you know it's amazing to see it because
[1:39:14] once the bride goes up brothers and
[1:39:15] sisters it wouldn't surprise me one
[1:39:17] second if that's part of what brother
[1:39:18] Branham saw as a vision where he just
[1:39:20] heard that awful explosion in the United
[1:39:22] States and he just saw smoking ashes you
[1:39:25] know in an instant it's going to change
[1:39:27] and we're not going to be here when that
[1:39:29] happens but
[1:39:30] we know
[1:39:32] that Grace here on Earth is holding
[1:39:34] something back
[1:39:36] I just couldn't help but think you know
[1:39:38] the the magma underground is just God's
[1:39:41] Fury
[1:39:41] and it's just there right under the
[1:39:43] surface
[1:39:44] and in so much that it's causing water
[1:39:46] to boil
[1:39:48] and shoot out a geyser and it's causing
[1:39:50] hot springs and the whole entire area is
[1:39:53] just active with all of this geothermal
[1:39:56] activity and it's fascinating to the
[1:39:59] human to see it to see nature behaving
[1:40:01] this way
[1:40:02] but it's God's Fury that's underneath
[1:40:04] there it's just right there and you know
[1:40:07] all it would take in this world is for
[1:40:08] everything here to just do an upside
[1:40:10] down flip and just take a thousand years
[1:40:12] and watch all of the fresh new seeds
[1:40:14] that were there
[1:40:16] just come to life again and all of the
[1:40:18] sin that was here just completely be
[1:40:20] baked out of this world
[1:40:22] if you've ever seen what a volcano looks
[1:40:24] like after it's erupted it's amazing
[1:40:25] because on a lava field you'll see this
[1:40:27] black lava field of rock and then you'll
[1:40:29] see little seeds Life coming to life all
[1:40:32] over the place in this rock this
[1:40:34] volcanic rock it's amazing
[1:40:37] but you know we're we're in a place
[1:40:39] where we know we know what's going on
[1:40:41] it's just a beautiful time to to be
[1:40:44] alive to recognize our position to
[1:40:46] recognize our day and its message
[1:40:49] you know Jesus when when he was here
[1:40:51] brother Branham talks about this message
[1:40:53] how he never defiled or contradicted any
[1:40:56] of his laws in paragraph 72 he says
[1:40:59] another thing he never defiled or
[1:41:01] contradicted any of his laws he cannot
[1:41:04] do that
[1:41:06] so a virgin I'll give you a sign
[1:41:10] I love how he says this not a Titanic
[1:41:14] not a U.N
[1:41:16] but I'll give you a sign of safety
[1:41:19] a virgin shall conceive
[1:41:22] and she shall bring forth the son and
[1:41:24] call him Emmanuel
[1:41:26] that's the sign yes
[1:41:29] and it's the same thing for us today
[1:41:31] brothers and sisters spiritually
[1:41:32] speaking you say the word you hear the
[1:41:34] angel messenger come unto you and say hi
[1:41:37] Oh hail thou highly favored woman
[1:41:42] God has had his eye on you and he's got
[1:41:45] a message from you that you're going to
[1:41:47] conceive
[1:41:48] you're going to have a baby and his name
[1:41:50] is called Jesus Christ
[1:41:52] and that's going to be the new birth
[1:41:55] we've had that angel messenger and we
[1:41:58] can choose to analyze it and say I don't
[1:41:59] know what he's saying to me I'm not sure
[1:42:01] he's kind of weird maybe it's just a
[1:42:03] different age he's you know back in the
[1:42:05] 60s I don't know if I can receive it
[1:42:07] that way or or just simply be it unto me
[1:42:10] according to Thy word and see what
[1:42:13] happens
[1:42:14] you know where the bat him in this
[1:42:15] message he talks about the Titanic in a
[1:42:17] couple of places and he said it and and
[1:42:19] I sometimes you know just to be honest
[1:42:22] with you I questioned it I say I'll
[1:42:25] questioned it the Titanic I didn't
[1:42:27] realize that it was actually an American
[1:42:28] ship
[1:42:29] the Titanic was made by Americans it was
[1:42:33] built over in Europe but it was made by
[1:42:35] the White Star Line which was an
[1:42:37] American shipping line brother Branham
[1:42:38] says that in this message I looked it up
[1:42:40] and I was I was just able to say amen
[1:42:43] that's wonderful I love that when you
[1:42:45] hear things and you just wonder because
[1:42:46] I always thought it was an English thing
[1:42:48] but you know what he said he said that
[1:42:50] they had such a a boastful Spirit on
[1:42:52] that ship that not not a wave could
[1:42:54] crash over it and cause it to sink and
[1:42:57] what did God do he put it on the bottom
[1:42:58] of the ocean just to show them you know
[1:43:00] what you will not tempt me there's
[1:43:02] nothing that's going to be a sign that
[1:43:04] you're going to be able to produce and
[1:43:06] in this message he talks about
[1:43:07] Nebuchadnezzar and and how he built the
[1:43:10] the Tower of Babel and and we know that
[1:43:13] that Tower was built it was built for a
[1:43:15] purpose it was built for the purpose
[1:43:17] that there shall be no other opportunity
[1:43:20] for God to flood mankind because they'll
[1:43:22] just be able to run up the tower and
[1:43:24] escape the flood as it comes but isn't
[1:43:27] it amazing to think that they didn't
[1:43:28] recognize that there was actually a sign
[1:43:31] given
[1:43:32] there was a sign and that sign was the
[1:43:34] prophet for the day and that sign was
[1:43:37] also given After the flood to show that
[1:43:40] there's a covenant that there will never
[1:43:41] be a flood so you're not even going to
[1:43:43] need a tower why would you be wasting
[1:43:45] your time with a tower when there's
[1:43:47] never even going to be a flood
[1:43:50] but you got to be willing to believe the
[1:43:52] word of God when it comes
[1:43:55] brother random says not a Titanic not
[1:43:57] something great by a man not a U.N
[1:44:00] but I'll give you a sign of safety that
[1:44:03] a virgin shall conceive as I read these
[1:44:06] as I see this and I say it I just think
[1:44:09] it is such a place of safety to
[1:44:11] recognize that we don't have to worry we
[1:44:14] don't have to run to and fro we don't
[1:44:16] have to search we don't have to question
[1:44:18] our hearts is this right we we might not
[1:44:21] understand it all and sometimes we'll
[1:44:22] have a little question about a thing
[1:44:24] here or there along the way but it
[1:44:25] doesn't change our faith in that God
[1:44:27] sent a prophet and that was so that we
[1:44:29] could be delivered
[1:44:31] doesn't change it at all because we
[1:44:33] recognize that that was a super sign
[1:44:35] that we were given in our day
[1:44:38] and I'll say it this way maybe we could
[1:44:40] look at that cloud over sunset Mountain
[1:44:42] and I would say brothers and sisters for
[1:44:44] us in our day that was a super sign
[1:44:46] that cloud represents way more than I
[1:44:49] think we give it credit many times that
[1:44:52] cloud recognize represents a doorway
[1:44:55] that was opened into heaven into the
[1:44:57] very mind of God to understand what
[1:44:59] those Seven Seals were sealed up for for
[1:45:01] all of the Ages were given to us in our
[1:45:04] generation were revealed to us
[1:45:07] I think that alone gives us the ability
[1:45:09] to Rejoice we have the ability to to
[1:45:12] understand things understand the very
[1:45:14] mind of God
[1:45:16] throughout all of the ages people were
[1:45:18] trying striving to understand coming up
[1:45:21] with different things even brother
[1:45:22] Branham saying that you know he had the
[1:45:24] idea that maybe this this Horse and
[1:45:26] Rider the the first horse rider that
[1:45:28] white horse rider he had a bow and
[1:45:31] arrows and he thought that maybe he was
[1:45:33] like cupid shooting arrows of love
[1:45:36] and we know that that Rider he had a bow
[1:45:38] but he never had any arrows
[1:45:40] because he was Satan that Antichrist
[1:45:43] Spirit but it was the angel of the Lord
[1:45:45] that met brother Branham that told him
[1:45:47] the truth about the matter every single
[1:45:49] night before he went out to preach the
[1:45:50] seals
[1:45:54] I just think it's so beautiful when we
[1:45:55] talk about this I'll give you a sign
[1:45:58] I'll give you a sign of safety that a
[1:46:01] virgin shall conceive
[1:46:03] but the problem goes on to say in
[1:46:04] paragraph 75 he gave another sign at a
[1:46:07] burning bush
[1:46:09] what was it
[1:46:11] when he caught his runaway Prophet I
[1:46:14] have heard the cries of my people and
[1:46:16] I've remembered my Covenant
[1:46:18] he gave another sign there
[1:46:22] and that sign wasn't the burning bush
[1:46:23] brothers and sisters that he was a
[1:46:25] covenant-keeping god
[1:46:27] isn't that wonderful
[1:46:30] because we know that many times a few
[1:46:32] times anyways in the Bible he has said I
[1:46:36] remembered my Covenant I've thought
[1:46:38] about the words that have been spoken
[1:46:40] the words that have been cried the
[1:46:42] prayers that have gone up and I
[1:46:44] remembered the Covenant that I made with
[1:46:47] my people
[1:46:49] I remembered that I think it's just
[1:46:51] beautiful that he was a covenant keeping
[1:46:54] God that he remembered everything that
[1:46:57] he said every promise that he had made
[1:47:01] brothers and sisters if we need healing
[1:47:02] in our minds
[1:47:04] he has promised us that he is not the
[1:47:07] author of confusion
[1:47:09] that he has given us the power of love
[1:47:13] and of a sound mind
[1:47:16] and when we start to get confused and we
[1:47:18] start to have problems in our mind we
[1:47:21] can just rebuke Satan and say you know
[1:47:22] what that's not the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:24] he's not the author of confusion
[1:47:28] if we're sick in our bodies we have the
[1:47:31] ability to remind him of his promise
[1:47:34] by my stripes you are healed
[1:47:38] we don't have to take what the devil
[1:47:41] hands us
[1:47:42] you know we we talked about this a while
[1:47:45] ago and and I I think sometimes the
[1:47:48] natural typing the spiritual is so
[1:47:50] important
[1:47:51] before we went to the states we stopped
[1:47:53] at a place called writing on Stone
[1:47:55] Provincial Park and we spent the night
[1:47:56] there
[1:47:58] and we took a walk and it's so amazing
[1:48:00] to to see the the things that are there
[1:48:03] just the natural surroundings and and
[1:48:05] and just the way God created the
[1:48:08] Prairies and and and all of the the
[1:48:11] creation there it almost looks like a
[1:48:13] city if you've ever seen it you'll know
[1:48:14] what I mean the way that erosion has
[1:48:16] happened on the hillside surrounding the
[1:48:18] Milk River and there's little I think
[1:48:21] they call them hoodoos like Stone
[1:48:22] formations they're like little towers
[1:48:24] and there's thousands and thousands of
[1:48:27] them around there and anyways the point
[1:48:29] I want to get to is we were walking
[1:48:31] along a trail they've got notices
[1:48:33] everywhere about snakes be very careful
[1:48:35] about snakes there's rattlesnakes there
[1:48:37] Prairie rattlesnakes they're venomous
[1:48:39] and they can kill they're very dangerous
[1:48:42] animals and and I just couldn't help but
[1:48:45] think you know we need to be very
[1:48:46] careful I know what this means we need
[1:48:48] to be very cautious and so we're walking
[1:48:50] on the pathways and I walk down a
[1:48:52] pathway and and the boys followed me
[1:48:54] down a pathway but then Lisa walked down
[1:48:56] the pathway and she heard a rattlesnake
[1:48:59] right on the edge of the pathway
[1:49:01] and I I was like are you serious and so
[1:49:04] I went back and I thought my goodness I
[1:49:06] walked right by here and had no idea
[1:49:08] and the boys walked right by here and
[1:49:10] had no idea in fact one of our boys I
[1:49:12] think it was Benjamin he stepped close
[1:49:14] to the edge of the pathway right where
[1:49:16] the snake was
[1:49:18] and you know how do we know he was there
[1:49:20] you could hear his sound
[1:49:24] I'd never heard a rattlesnake in person
[1:49:26] before
[1:49:27] but that's what it sounds like and so it
[1:49:30] just made me think about it you know
[1:49:31] we're looking at this snake and looking
[1:49:33] at this snake and we went down the path
[1:49:35] and went and saw the stuff we wanted to
[1:49:36] see and we came back up and wondered is
[1:49:38] he still there
[1:49:40] I did that and you hear that
[1:49:42] he's still there he's right there
[1:49:46] and it just made me think about the
[1:49:47] quote that brother Branham says you know
[1:49:49] when when you just have this thing in
[1:49:51] your life and you just continue to look
[1:49:52] at it and you say I rebuke you I rebuke
[1:49:54] you I rebuke you I rebuke you
[1:49:56] turn a walk away
[1:49:59] but if I stood there and just said I
[1:50:00] rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you and
[1:50:04] he would just keep rattling and Rattle
[1:50:05] and eventually he would come out wake up
[1:50:06] and come out maybe when it got a little
[1:50:08] bit cooler and I'd get bit
[1:50:10] in our lives brothers and sisters I
[1:50:12] believe it's the same way the natural
[1:50:14] types of spiritual don't look at it just
[1:50:17] move on
[1:50:18] let him keep rattling in the background
[1:50:20] say I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:50:22] and just keep going just keep pressing
[1:50:25] on like brother Branham said that voice
[1:50:26] told him
[1:50:28] don't get hung up on a on a Viper in
[1:50:30] your life
[1:50:32] Satan's gonna have enough of them we're
[1:50:34] gonna see enough of them on our paths we
[1:50:36] don't need to stop and dwell on it
[1:50:38] even though I really wanted to see it
[1:50:40] because I am fascinated with them only
[1:50:42] because only because
[1:50:44] I recognize what happened in the garden
[1:50:46] and I know all of us do and so I'll just
[1:50:49] tell you my thoughts what was was the
[1:50:51] serpent one animal was it one creature
[1:50:54] sure it was we believed that he walked
[1:50:56] up right but then God cursed it so
[1:50:58] cursed
[1:51:00] how many varieties of them are there now
[1:51:04] and how many of them are lethal to human
[1:51:06] beings
[1:51:07] naturally and spiritually
[1:51:10] why
[1:51:12] but I just thought it was so beautiful
[1:51:13] because we could stand there and say I
[1:51:15] rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you and
[1:51:18] just listen to him Rattle and maybe talk
[1:51:20] to other people coming up the pathways
[1:51:22] and warn them look there's a snake there
[1:51:23] be careful or we could just keep going
[1:51:27] and trusted everyone else follows the
[1:51:29] same signs that we follow we read the
[1:51:31] signs we understood be careful there's
[1:51:33] snakes everywhere
[1:51:35] I just thought it was beautiful to see
[1:51:37] that
[1:51:38] paragraph 77 here it says but when it
[1:51:40] comes to the Plan of Redemption he came
[1:51:42] alone I know we talked about this last
[1:51:45] week but I just want to talk about it
[1:51:46] this week
[1:51:47] he didn't send an angel he didn't send a
[1:51:50] prophet he didn't send a good man or a
[1:51:52] good woman he didn't send anyone else
[1:51:55] he came alone
[1:51:58] when it came to the Plan of Redemption
[1:52:00] he came alone nobody was with him
[1:52:03] he was the only one that could come an
[1:52:07] angel couldn't do it another man called
[1:52:09] his son couldn't do it
[1:52:14] he's going to hang there for a second
[1:52:16] another man called his son couldn't do
[1:52:19] it
[1:52:23] why
[1:52:27] one called something else a holy virgin
[1:52:29] or holy mother or some Saint couldn't do
[1:52:32] it
[1:52:34] God
[1:52:35] had to come
[1:52:38] and I'll give you the sign
[1:52:40] a virgin shall conceive and a baby will
[1:52:44] be born and he will be Emmanuel God With
[1:52:46] Us the super sign I'll just say it again
[1:52:49] this time last week this hit me while I
[1:52:51] was preaching and I think it's so
[1:52:53] beautiful because for those that want to
[1:52:54] say that Jesus wasn't God you can't call
[1:52:57] him Emmanuel then
[1:52:59] because Emanuel says God With Us that's
[1:53:01] the meaning of the word Emmanuel and I
[1:53:04] had never thought of it that way until
[1:53:06] we were ministering last week but that's
[1:53:08] what he is God With Us the super sign
[1:53:10] God in his people
[1:53:13] god with his people God become his
[1:53:16] people God and man became one a sign
[1:53:21] a stumbling block to the world
[1:53:24] but a blessed hope for the believer
[1:53:26] a sign that will be evil spoken of
[1:53:30] just like us today brothers and sisters
[1:53:33] I just think is so amazing
[1:53:36] because it's simply the I am
[1:53:40] I am it's not a plurality
[1:53:43] it's not us
[1:53:45] the Father the Son the Holy Ghost is not
[1:53:48] we
[1:53:48] it's I am
[1:53:51] that's all
[1:53:53] and Jesus was God
[1:53:56] the word
[1:53:58] became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:54:02] paragraph 80 brother batam says and at
[1:54:04] the Red Sea he showed that he would make
[1:54:07] a way for those who were trying to do
[1:54:09] right and follow his commandment
[1:54:11] don't matter what cuts it off
[1:54:14] God proved that the Red Sea and gave a
[1:54:17] sign
[1:54:18] that he could open up the sea
[1:54:21] in every temptation
[1:54:23] brothers and sisters he's not just
[1:54:25] speaking to the people in 1959. he's
[1:54:28] speaking to us this is stored up food
[1:54:30] for a purpose for a season and I believe
[1:54:33] we have the ability to feed upon these
[1:54:36] these spiritual rations that were given
[1:54:38] to us but I don't think it was rationed
[1:54:40] out in a in a careful manner we have
[1:54:43] been given a gusher we can we can just
[1:54:46] go and and help ourselves to this Buffet
[1:54:49] of food at any time that we want to and
[1:54:52] and he says that the Red Sea he showed
[1:54:54] that he would make a way for those who
[1:54:56] were trying to do right and follow his
[1:54:58] commandment is there anybody here today
[1:55:00] trying to do right and follow his
[1:55:02] Commandments he says no matter what cuts
[1:55:04] it off God proved that the Red Sea and
[1:55:06] gave a sign that he would open up the
[1:55:08] sea in every Temptation he will make a
[1:55:11] way of Escape
[1:55:13] say mother don't believe it Daddy don't
[1:55:14] believe it the church don't believe it I
[1:55:16] don't care who don't believe it
[1:55:18] if you believe it God Will Make A Way of
[1:55:21] Escape
[1:55:22] and that's why I keep saying it brothers
[1:55:24] and sisters it doesn't matter what our
[1:55:26] past Traditions are it doesn't matter
[1:55:28] what our past teachings are what what is
[1:55:31] it to you today what is the Gospel of
[1:55:34] Jesus Christ today what is the message
[1:55:36] of the hour today and I'll say it this
[1:55:39] way who is the message of the hour today
[1:55:41] because it's Jesus Christ but not Jesus
[1:55:44] Christ somewhere out there it's got to
[1:55:46] be Jesus Christ right here
[1:55:48] be it unto me according to Thy word let
[1:55:50] that life that grows inside of me become
[1:55:52] Jesus Christ so much so that the world
[1:55:54] around me doesn't see brother Barry
[1:55:57] Johnson they see Jesus Christ
[1:56:01] if you believe it God Will Make A Way of
[1:56:03] Escape he gave a sign that he would
[1:56:08] they were on their way straight to the
[1:56:10] promised land I think brother Branham
[1:56:12] says it was what a two or three day
[1:56:14] Journey
[1:56:15] that took 40 years
[1:56:18] can you imagine that
[1:56:20] and what caused it murmuring
[1:56:24] that's what caused it murmuring
[1:56:28] critiquing criticizing
[1:56:31] all of that business in the background
[1:56:33] you're not the only Pebble on the beach
[1:56:36] Nathan and Cora
[1:56:38] you're not the only holy man Moses
[1:56:40] why should we listen to you God blesses
[1:56:42] us
[1:56:44] you shouldn't do what you feel led to do
[1:56:47] right
[1:56:49] but he gave a sign and only those who
[1:56:52] could believe were able to believe
[1:56:55] and you know sadly it took that
[1:56:57] generation to die out
[1:56:59] God finally said I'm done with you those
[1:57:01] carcasses will fall in the wilderness
[1:57:03] and only those who were what 20 21 years
[1:57:05] old and under they're the ones that will
[1:57:08] go in because blessed are those eyes
[1:57:11] that haven't seen Thomas than those who
[1:57:15] actually have those people who haven't
[1:57:17] seen but they've heard and they
[1:57:19] understand by the speaking of the word
[1:57:21] something inside them just says Amen to
[1:57:24] that word brother Branham says he gave a
[1:57:26] sign that he would they were on their
[1:57:28] way straight to the promised land where
[1:57:29] God promised them and the Red Sea shut
[1:57:32] them off and they got in trouble they
[1:57:34] didn't know what to do God showed them
[1:57:36] that he would make a way of Escape in
[1:57:38] every Temptation every trial
[1:57:40] he says you can't quit smoking take God
[1:57:43] one time
[1:57:45] you can't quit lying
[1:57:46] can't quit stealing can't quit having a
[1:57:49] temper
[1:57:50] take god with you one time
[1:57:53] if you don't feel like going to church
[1:57:54] and you can't get anywhere take god with
[1:57:57] you once take his promise he proved at
[1:58:01] the Red Sea that's a long ways back
[1:58:03] isn't it that he'll make a way of Escape
[1:58:07] God has gave so many signs
[1:58:10] if we're having a problem if we've got a
[1:58:12] situation brothers and sisters just take
[1:58:13] God one time that's what the prophet
[1:58:15] said just take God one time and just see
[1:58:17] if God won't open that sea up for us
[1:58:20] and we know that he's not going to open
[1:58:22] the sea and and say that I won't
[1:58:24] actually allow you to go through the sea
[1:58:26] I'll just float you over top of the sea
[1:58:28] with angels and put you down on the
[1:58:29] other side and and everything will be
[1:58:31] rainbows and butterflies that'll be soft
[1:58:33] and fluffy no no no no no no no no
[1:58:35] he'll actually make a way for us to go
[1:58:38] right through that trial right through
[1:58:40] that Red Sea right through that problem
[1:58:41] First Corinthians 10 says there hath no
[1:58:44] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:58:47] common to man
[1:58:49] God knows he knows exactly what
[1:58:51] Temptations will come our way he knows
[1:58:53] exactly the way we've been created so
[1:58:55] does Satan but what Satan doesn't
[1:58:57] understand is that God's going to make a
[1:58:59] way for us to escape whereas Satan
[1:59:02] thinks he's going to make a way for us
[1:59:03] to get destroyed
[1:59:06] because I understand but God is faithful
[1:59:09] there hath no temptation taken you but
[1:59:12] such as is common to man but God is
[1:59:15] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:59:18] tempted above that ye are able he won't
[1:59:20] let it go to the point where you'll
[1:59:22] break
[1:59:23] but will with the Temptation also make a
[1:59:26] way to escape
[1:59:27] so brothers and sisters I want to say
[1:59:29] this is encouragement this morning if
[1:59:30] you're getting Temptation if you're
[1:59:32] getting manifold Temptations in your
[1:59:34] life if there's a situations that seem
[1:59:36] like they're closing in rejoice
[1:59:38] this is where we want to start talking
[1:59:40] about worship start to Worship the Lord
[1:59:43] give him praise because that means he's
[1:59:45] going to make a way of Escape for you
[1:59:47] out of that Temptation if you didn't
[1:59:49] have Temptation there would be no way of
[1:59:51] Escape now some would say well then I
[1:59:53] wouldn't need a way of Escape but in
[1:59:55] this flesh in this world I think we all
[1:59:57] need a way of Escape there's got to be
[1:59:58] something for us in this world more than
[2:00:01] what we see in this world boy oh boy
[2:00:05] I think it's just beautiful he gives us
[2:00:07] the way of Escape through the Temptation
[2:00:09] that he takes us through through the Red
[2:00:11] Sea we get our back up against the
[2:00:13] mountain and we get our our front up
[2:00:15] against the sea and and we see the I
[2:00:19] want to say Satan we see Pharaoh's Army
[2:00:21] coming after us we can see the smoke and
[2:00:23] the Chariots and the dust coming our way
[2:00:25] what happened it was a pillar of fire
[2:00:28] that came down when they cried out that
[2:00:30] Pillar of Fire came down and protected
[2:00:32] them from that enemy until he created a
[2:00:37] way of escape and you know what he's
[2:00:39] just saying yesterday today and forever
[2:00:40] brothers and sisters don't ever doubt
[2:00:42] that picture of the pillar of fire we
[2:00:44] don't worship a man but what that does
[2:00:46] is shows us that same Pillar of Fire is
[2:00:48] here right now we might not see the
[2:00:51] pillar of fire in this room but he's in
[2:00:52] this room right now
[2:00:56] and he wants to give us a way through
[2:00:59] he wants to show us you don't have to be
[2:01:02] subject to the rattlesnake on the side
[2:01:04] of the trail all you got to do is stop
[2:01:06] looking at him
[2:01:08] stop talking to him stop talking about
[2:01:11] him stop giving him any power in your
[2:01:14] life and just walk on just keep pressing
[2:01:17] forwards
[2:01:21] because he borrows bodies
[2:01:23] and he wants yours
[2:01:26] LeBron says he just borrowed the womb of
[2:01:28] the woman
[2:01:29] the same as he borrows this body to
[2:01:31] preach the gospel from
[2:01:33] the same as he borrows your body to do
[2:01:36] the work that he wants to do through you
[2:01:37] because he still is Emmanuel God With Us
[2:01:44] a sign god with his people God living
[2:01:47] among his people the super
[2:01:51] Everlasting sign it can never fail
[2:01:55] it'll always be the sign
[2:01:59] Christ in you
[2:02:01] the hope of glory
[2:02:08] I just think it's so beautiful when we
[2:02:10] look at this and recognize that he has
[2:02:12] already made a way of Escape for us
[2:02:16] he knew what trials we would encounter
[2:02:18] he knew what dispositions we would have
[2:02:21] he knew what families we would come from
[2:02:24] he knew the trials the struggles that we
[2:02:27] would encounter in our lives
[2:02:29] and he said you know what I know that
[2:02:31] there's no way that Satan will ever be
[2:02:34] able to get them to curse me to my face
[2:02:37] and you know what Satan if you think you
[2:02:39] can you can go ahead and try
[2:02:41] what makes us think that we're any
[2:02:42] different than job
[2:02:44] just go on and try it
[2:02:46] but they're going to overcome
[2:02:48] they're not going to overcome By Their
[2:02:49] Own Strength they're not going to
[2:02:50] overcome by the Believers from the
[2:02:52] church even though they're a support
[2:02:54] group they're only going to overcome by
[2:02:56] one way one method and that's by the
[2:02:58] word of God that's the word for their
[2:03:01] day they're going to overcome every
[2:03:03] single Temptation and every single trial
[2:03:06] foreign
[2:03:08] I just think it's beautiful that he
[2:03:09] borrows a body you know in John 10 37
[2:03:13] says when he was here on Earth he proved
[2:03:16] that he was God proved that God was in
[2:03:18] him
[2:03:19] because the signs of God followed him
[2:03:22] he said if I do not the works of my
[2:03:24] father then believe me not but if I do
[2:03:26] the works of my father if you don't
[2:03:29] believe me
[2:03:31] believe the works
[2:03:33] the sign Emmanuel
[2:03:36] I and my father are one
[2:03:40] now this can be a real choking point for
[2:03:44] some people
[2:03:45] and and even myself as I look at this I
[2:03:49] think well what Mighty signs and wonders
[2:03:51] have I done in my life and I know that
[2:03:53] Satan coming around saying that to me
[2:03:56] because I don't think I've seen
[2:03:57] tremendous signs and wonders at my hand
[2:04:00] but I sure have at his hand I sure have
[2:04:04] in his hand and that's brothers and
[2:04:05] sisters one of the main reasons why I
[2:04:07] really enjoy testimony service because
[2:04:09] Satan wants us to believe that
[2:04:11] everything is just happening smooth and
[2:04:13] there's really nothing happening God's
[2:04:15] power isn't in his church and and
[2:04:17] where's the Miracles and we're not
[2:04:19] seeing great signs and wonders but we
[2:04:21] are seeing great signs and wonders we
[2:04:23] are seeing Mighty signs and wonders as
[2:04:25] the Church of the Living God he is with
[2:04:27] us even in us living out his word
[2:04:31] and you know Satan wants us to believe
[2:04:32] that nope you haven't been healed when
[2:04:34] you see someone get healed oh
[2:04:35] immediately the body just says oh they
[2:04:37] couldn't have been that sick couldn't
[2:04:38] have been that bad really really
[2:04:43] I remember hearing a brother tell me
[2:04:44] that he had one time where he had the
[2:04:46] devil attack him and he was laying on
[2:04:48] the floor in his bathroom and his eyes
[2:04:50] went yellow the whites of his eyes went
[2:04:53] yellow and we know that that is is is
[2:04:55] alongside various different diseases
[2:04:59] but he said he was out flat on the floor
[2:05:02] in that condition and he prayed and he
[2:05:05] prayed and God delivered him from it
[2:05:08] that's just one little thing but how
[2:05:10] many more little things like that that
[2:05:12] happened brothers and sisters we get a
[2:05:14] stomach ache and you know what sometimes
[2:05:16] in our mind we'll start to say oh what
[2:05:18] is that what is that Satan will come
[2:05:20] around and say yeah you've got this
[2:05:21] Pokey thing and it's just not going away
[2:05:22] it's been there for days it truly must
[2:05:24] be something terrible so now you've got
[2:05:26] this certain something and and we can
[2:05:28] say in our minds yeah I had
[2:05:30] I sure feel it man I really feel that
[2:05:34] thing maybe it's true maybe that's what
[2:05:35] I've got and we can start to buy into
[2:05:37] that that that thought train or we can
[2:05:40] just say no I don't I rebuke you in the
[2:05:42] name of Jesus Christ no I don't
[2:05:45] even if we go and see a doctor a doctor
[2:05:47] could tell us that that could be well
[2:05:49] you know you could have this and you
[2:05:50] could have that we could say well I
[2:05:51] don't like that but that one sounds not
[2:05:53] bad so maybe maybe that's what it is
[2:05:56] Win Lose or Draw right no that's not the
[2:05:59] word of God it's a box of rattlesnakes
[2:06:01] and you can just take it back because I
[2:06:03] don't have it
[2:06:09] and as he sends me so send I you the
[2:06:12] father was sent me
[2:06:14] is with me
[2:06:16] he is in me and doing the works of
[2:06:19] himself
[2:06:20] it's God in flesh
[2:06:22] it's God in flesh
[2:06:25] I just want to encourage us today
[2:06:26] brothers and sisters to recognize our
[2:06:28] position our position is that we are God
[2:06:31] in flesh
[2:06:32] when we have his holy spirit living out
[2:06:34] through us
[2:06:36] we are God in flesh
[2:06:39] the devil wants us to say there's no
[2:06:40] possible way that could ever be you're
[2:06:42] crazy you're a lunatic you're a heretic
[2:06:44] you're one of those Holy Rollers I say
[2:06:47] be it unto me according to Thy word call
[2:06:49] me a holy ruler and you'll see me jump
[2:06:52] up and down and scream and shout because
[2:06:53] that's where the victory lies
[2:06:56] the children of Israel were going into
[2:06:58] their promised land and fighting the
[2:06:59] enemies their their victories weren't in
[2:07:02] in just staying quiet
[2:07:04] was it
[2:07:06] over and over and over again the
[2:07:08] children of Israel were instructed by
[2:07:09] the Lord through the prophet
[2:07:13] go and stand in your position
[2:07:15] you just go to church that's all you got
[2:07:17] to do
[2:07:19] just go to church and I'll do the work
[2:07:22] but when the time comes I'm going to
[2:07:24] tell you to shout
[2:07:26] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and
[2:07:29] watch what will happen then the enemy
[2:07:31] will be wiped out
[2:07:33] can you imagine that brothers and
[2:07:34] sisters if we had Devils coming after us
[2:07:36] and we were just willing to do that just
[2:07:38] go to church and just wait until the
[2:07:40] time comes where we can worship until
[2:07:42] the time comes that we can just take
[2:07:43] every single ordinance that God has
[2:07:45] given us to do and we just can't wait to
[2:07:47] do it because we believe because you
[2:07:49] know what's going to happen when that
[2:07:50] happens the walls of the enemy are going
[2:07:52] to come tearing down
[2:07:54] an enemy we know we're not looking at
[2:07:56] enemies that are coming at us with
[2:07:58] swords and staves we're not looking at
[2:07:59] enemies that are coming at us with with
[2:08:01] guns and bombs we're looking at
[2:08:03] spiritual enemies because we don't
[2:08:05] wrestle against flesh and blood we're
[2:08:07] not wrestling against what we see with
[2:08:08] our eyes what we're wrestling against is
[2:08:11] demons Devils tormentors that want to
[2:08:14] try and get us to fall down to try and
[2:08:16] get us to unbelieve to try and get us to
[2:08:18] say oh I am too weak I'm too beaten down
[2:08:20] I can't believe the word of God because
[2:08:21] it really doesn't have effect in my life
[2:08:23] anyways I can't live it there's no way
[2:08:25] that I could ever live it so I might as
[2:08:26] well just eat drink and be merry that's
[2:08:28] what the devil wants to hear from our
[2:08:29] voice but not from a Believer a Believer
[2:08:31] will say no be it unto me according to
[2:08:33] Thy word no I believe this word of God
[2:08:35] and it doesn't matter what he takes me
[2:08:37] through he will always provide a way of
[2:08:39] Escape through that temptation
[2:08:43] because it's not me doing the work
[2:08:46] he is in me and doing the works of
[2:08:48] himself
[2:08:51] when we start trying to do it then he
[2:08:54] stops
[2:08:55] he can't do it through us when we're
[2:08:57] trying to do it
[2:08:59] but could you imagine it though if you
[2:09:01] could just actually
[2:09:03] take God at his word and follow him to
[2:09:05] the letter
[2:09:06] and watch
[2:09:07] spiritually speaking the enemies just
[2:09:10] get slayed just destroyed left and right
[2:09:13] if you read some of the stories in the
[2:09:16] Old Testament about how the enemies were
[2:09:18] destroyed many times they actually
[2:09:20] destroyed themselves they went to their
[2:09:22] neighbor and they stuck each other with
[2:09:24] a sword and they didn't realize that
[2:09:25] they were killing each other but the
[2:09:27] Lord Jesus is going to do the same thing
[2:09:28] for us brothers and sisters he's going
[2:09:30] to take those enemies those Temptations
[2:09:31] and he's going to make a way of Escape
[2:09:33] for us through them and they're going to
[2:09:35] destroy themselves simply because we
[2:09:37] believe the word of God
[2:09:40] and that in itself is the super sign our
[2:09:43] ability to say I recognize my position I
[2:09:46] recognize his position I don't feel like
[2:09:49] it I sure don't look like it but that's
[2:09:51] irrelevant because his word says that I
[2:09:53] am
[2:09:54] and I remember I I had that conversation
[2:09:57] a long time ago when I was really
[2:09:58] starting to catch this Revelation I just
[2:10:01] couldn't believe it and and I know the
[2:10:03] devil came around and said to me who
[2:10:04] said You Are a son of God
[2:10:07] who said you are and I had a voice come
[2:10:11] to my mind immediately it was like on
[2:10:13] one side literally there was one voice
[2:10:14] speaking and on one side literally
[2:10:16] there's another voice speaking one voice
[2:10:18] said who said you are another voice said
[2:10:20] the word of God I believe it was said I
[2:10:22] am said I am and you know brothers and
[2:10:25] sisters when the Devil comes around and
[2:10:26] says it to you I just want to encourage
[2:10:28] you just say that I am said I am not
[2:10:30] that I was or I will be it's got to be
[2:10:32] the I am today
[2:10:35] it's got to be the Lord today
[2:10:38] John 10 says if I do not the works of my
[2:10:40] father believe me not but if I do though
[2:10:42] ye believed not me believe the works
[2:10:44] that they may know and believe that the
[2:10:46] father is in me and I in him and how are
[2:10:48] we going to do the works brothers and
[2:10:49] sisters we might not see the great
[2:10:50] tremendous healing campaigns and and
[2:10:53] signs and wonders don't worry about that
[2:10:55] don't look at that look at the word look
[2:10:56] at your ability to receive the word of
[2:10:58] God in your day if you can say Amen to
[2:11:01] the message of the hour and live it
[2:11:03] you don't have to worry
[2:11:05] you are that super sign you are the
[2:11:09] answer to the devil's question
[2:11:11] will he actually have a bride of his own
[2:11:14] choosing what will she be like will she
[2:11:16] be big and fancy will she be in the in
[2:11:19] the in the great tremendous Church boy
[2:11:21] when we were in Helena Montana they've
[2:11:24] got a cathedral there that's beautiful
[2:11:26] for anybody that's ever seen it it's
[2:11:28] tremendous we didn't get to go inside it
[2:11:30] but the outside of it the spiers the
[2:11:32] Steeples just tremendous
[2:11:35] and I just I said I said to Lisa when we
[2:11:38] were driving there I said you know I
[2:11:39] wonder how that church over there feels
[2:11:41] I bet you they're Spirit-filled but they
[2:11:44] just there's one little church on the
[2:11:45] corner there and I mean little it was
[2:11:46] just tiny little church and and there's
[2:11:48] this ginormous Cathedral right over here
[2:11:51] you could throw a stone and hit it and
[2:11:53] here's this other funny little building
[2:11:55] over here with the church and I just
[2:11:57] thought my isn't that the difference
[2:11:59] between the Believers and and maybe the
[2:12:02] make-believers and I know brother
[2:12:03] Brandon said there's Believers in every
[2:12:04] group so I'm not going to put anybody in
[2:12:06] or anybody out but we know that Jesus he
[2:12:08] didn't decide to come for the God didn't
[2:12:10] decide to come for the Rich and Famous
[2:12:12] he didn't come for the the the the most
[2:12:16] religious folks of the day he came for
[2:12:18] the Sinners he came for the publicans he
[2:12:19] came for the ones who were sick that
[2:12:21] needed healing he came for those people
[2:12:23] that needed Deliverance
[2:12:26] paragraph 91 brother Adam says I'll give
[2:12:28] you an everlasting sign for God was made
[2:12:30] flesh Among Us he dwelt in flesh it'll
[2:12:33] be an everlasting sign not only to the
[2:12:35] Shepherds to look and believe but for
[2:12:38] you the Branham Tabernacle and for this
[2:12:41] cruel world to believe that that is God
[2:12:46] and I just can't help but say you know
[2:12:48] what because I believe this message of
[2:12:50] the hour I put myself in that Branham
[2:12:51] Tabernacle
[2:12:53] maybe that's just me being a little bit
[2:12:54] crazy but but I just think that's the
[2:12:57] way it is not only to the Shepherds to
[2:12:58] look on and believe but for you the
[2:13:01] Branham Tabernacle and for this cruel
[2:13:03] world to believe that is God God gave us
[2:13:05] that sign Jesus said as the living
[2:13:07] father has sent me and come with me and
[2:13:10] was in me so send I you
[2:13:13] the living father to go with you and be
[2:13:16] in you an everlasting sign
[2:13:20] these signs shall follow them that
[2:13:22] believe
[2:13:25] we know that it's Mark 16 in action
[2:13:27] right
[2:13:28] and and all else is false
[2:13:31] that's what brother Branham said in the
[2:13:32] church age book
[2:13:33] Mark 16 in action is the true church and
[2:13:37] that's the only one that he claims is
[2:13:38] his own
[2:13:39] and all else is false
[2:13:41] don't don't don't let that be the
[2:13:43] measuring stick though
[2:13:45] don't let that be your measuring stick
[2:13:46] as to whether you believe or not because
[2:13:48] you know what brother Branham says it
[2:13:49] very clearly in the message that God
[2:13:51] could call a man one time to use that
[2:13:53] man one time in his life his entire life
[2:13:57] and maybe give them the ability to live
[2:13:59] to a good old ripe age
[2:14:01] maybe three score and ten plus 20. who
[2:14:04] knows
[2:14:06] that's 90 years for those who don't know
[2:14:09] the problem I says three score and 10
[2:14:11] which is 70.
[2:14:14] but here we have the understanding that
[2:14:17] he'll be with us even in us to the end
[2:14:20] of the world
[2:14:22] he might only use us one time in our
[2:14:24] lives
[2:14:25] that's why we can't let that be the
[2:14:27] measuring stick
[2:14:28] that one time could be at the end of our
[2:14:30] life could be at the beginning of our
[2:14:31] life and the rest of our life we just
[2:14:33] wonder maybe did we have something was
[2:14:35] there something in our life that's not
[2:14:36] the measuring stick that's what brother
[2:14:37] Branham said that's not the the the the
[2:14:40] Perfection of the Bride the Perfection
[2:14:41] of the Bride is is the measuring stick
[2:14:43] of the word the ability to stick with
[2:14:45] the word for her day that's why that's
[2:14:48] the true evidence of having the Holy
[2:14:49] Ghost In Our Lives is the ability to say
[2:14:51] Amen to the word but not just say Amen
[2:14:53] to the word but to live the word and
[2:14:54] then you know what brothers and sisters
[2:14:55] we've talked about this a while ago in
[2:14:57] the past it's already 12 o'clock I'm
[2:14:59] sure we'll be okay for a couple more
[2:15:01] minutes I hope but you know what Jesus
[2:15:03] said that I am the vine and ye are the
[2:15:05] branches and you know what every Branch
[2:15:08] gets purged and whatever's inside that
[2:15:11] branch is going to give the fruit of
[2:15:13] what's inside that person and and
[2:15:15] whether we like it or not whether we
[2:15:17] understand it or not when we come around
[2:15:18] the word of God when it's true word
[2:15:21] teaching and preaching the word of God
[2:15:24] is going to purge every single branch
[2:15:26] and every single branch is going to give
[2:15:28] fruit from their Ministry from their
[2:15:30] lives and whether they know it or not
[2:15:32] whether they believe it or not whether
[2:15:33] they recognize it or not the whole
[2:15:36] entire world is going to see the fruit
[2:15:38] of that Ministry of that life
[2:15:40] we can't help it
[2:15:42] it's the spirit of God it's the way it
[2:15:44] works
[2:15:45] if he is the vine and we're plugged into
[2:15:48] that vine and we are the branches
[2:15:52] we're going to give the same fruit that
[2:15:53] they did back in the book of Acts
[2:15:56] we're not going to give other fruit
[2:15:58] if we're an orange tree we're not going
[2:16:01] to produce lemons
[2:16:02] and you know what brothers and sisters
[2:16:04] if we see people producing lemons
[2:16:07] if we are an orange tree
[2:16:10] it's not up to us to go and prune those
[2:16:11] branches
[2:16:13] I think it's important to say it
[2:16:15] it's not up to us to do that that's up
[2:16:17] to God to do that
[2:16:19] keep watering that tree
[2:16:22] keep making sure that that tree is
[2:16:23] protected
[2:16:25] those are our brothers and our sisters
[2:16:27] maybe they just don't have the same
[2:16:29] Revelation that we do but they're still
[2:16:31] our brothers and our sisters we want to
[2:16:33] treat everyone the same way we want to
[2:16:35] give everyone the opportunity that we've
[2:16:37] got
[2:16:42] paragraph 109 of this message it shall
[2:16:45] be light again in the evening time
[2:16:47] oh this dark day that we've been through
[2:16:51] but for 40 years the clouds has been
[2:16:53] clearing back
[2:16:54] through the first reforming of the
[2:16:57] bringing forth of the message
[2:17:00] that God and Christ are one
[2:17:05] that God was made manifest in flesh he
[2:17:10] chose to dwell in human flesh
[2:17:13] and today
[2:17:15] they make him something sitting on a
[2:17:18] throne
[2:17:19] they put him out there
[2:17:21] as the eye will be
[2:17:24] they put him out there
[2:17:28] sorry
[2:17:30] and today they make him something
[2:17:31] sitting on a throne they make him a some
[2:17:34] prehistoric something some of them wants
[2:17:37] to take him back to a philosopher
[2:17:39] some wants to make him a prophet
[2:17:42] but brother
[2:17:44] he is God in you
[2:17:47] God manifests in flesh how
[2:17:52] how did they know he was God In the
[2:17:54] Flesh
[2:17:55] he said if I don't do the works of my
[2:17:56] father
[2:17:57] that I've told you wrong but if I do the
[2:17:59] works of my father
[2:18:01] you believe it
[2:18:03] how does that work in our lives I keep
[2:18:04] saying it and maybe I'll say it this way
[2:18:06] the same thing just in a different way
[2:18:09] The Works that we'll do in the name of
[2:18:11] our father is to believe the word
[2:18:14] that's the works that we'll do we'll go
[2:18:16] to church
[2:18:16] we'll worship we'll actually pay our
[2:18:19] tithes we'll actually go to church half
[2:18:21] an hour early like the prophet said
[2:18:22] we'll actually go to communion and foot
[2:18:25] washing will will follow all of the
[2:18:28] leadership of the spirit through the
[2:18:30] prophet that is our sign to this world
[2:18:32] that's our sign that we believe this
[2:18:34] word of God for our day it's not
[2:18:36] something that we say it's pretty easy
[2:18:38] to say oh God said a prophet and I can
[2:18:40] just get my own Ministry and now maybe I
[2:18:42] can act in a certain way and and draw
[2:18:44] men unto me that's not the way it works
[2:18:46] that's not the way it works the ministry
[2:18:48] that wants to do that you know it's
[2:18:49] false
[2:18:51] because they want to point to God the
[2:18:53] the true Ministry of of Jesus Christ
[2:18:55] will always point to God
[2:18:58] we know that twice John tried to Worship
[2:19:00] in the Book of Revelation and the angel
[2:19:03] message Angel he said no see thou do it
[2:19:07] not worship God don't worship a man
[2:19:09] don't worship an angel
[2:19:11] worship God
[2:19:13] how did they know he was God in flesh he
[2:19:15] said if I do not the works of my father
[2:19:17] then I've told you wrong but if I do the
[2:19:18] works of my father if I follow the word
[2:19:21] then believe it
[2:19:23] and brothers and sisters you're a super
[2:19:25] sign then
[2:19:28] we'll draw into a close here
[2:19:29] maybe I'll call the musicians
[2:19:33] and now the same thing paragraph 111 the
[2:19:36] message is revived again in the last
[2:19:38] days
[2:19:40] the message of who he is
[2:19:43] what he is
[2:19:46] when the church recognizes what it is
[2:19:50] then the Rapture will go I think this is
[2:19:53] just beautiful because I believe it
[2:19:55] wasn't until 1962 or 63 that he was
[2:19:58] saying those words
[2:20:00] but here we have them in 1959 which
[2:20:02] wasn't really far behind or before and
[2:20:05] now the same thing the message is
[2:20:07] revived again in the last days the
[2:20:08] message of who he is what he is Emmanuel
[2:20:12] dwelling in you
[2:20:15] with the same works that he did manifest
[2:20:18] himself through you the very same things
[2:20:21] that he did
[2:20:23] it's the evening light it's evil spoken
[2:20:26] of it's a hard way it's not easy just to
[2:20:28] actually live the message of the hour
[2:20:30] brothers and sisters it's not easy we've
[2:20:33] said it before in the past I'll say it
[2:20:34] today you know what for the children to
[2:20:36] look at us we look like maybe some of
[2:20:38] the elders they're polished folks they
[2:20:40] come to church every Sunday every
[2:20:42] Wednesday they come to communion foot
[2:20:44] washing they pay their tithes they they
[2:20:45] help out with the potlucks they help out
[2:20:47] with the church cleanups and they're
[2:20:49] always there to to be in church and
[2:20:51] everything is fine in their life right
[2:20:53] some of those people are the most battle
[2:20:55] scarred spiritual Warriors that you'll
[2:20:57] ever meet but they keep getting up and
[2:20:59] they keep going to church and they keep
[2:21:01] giving God the praise that he wants they
[2:21:03] keep believing the word of God and that
[2:21:05] is the evidence of that super sign
[2:21:08] it's nothing else it's not saying that
[2:21:10] they've raised people from the dead that
[2:21:12] they've been able to maybe lay hands on
[2:21:14] a car that was sick or or a baby that
[2:21:17] was Ill or all kinds of different signs
[2:21:19] and wonders no that's the devil's work
[2:21:21] he's gonna try and make us believe that
[2:21:22] our life is going to be better if we see
[2:21:24] some of those things that's not it your
[2:21:26] ability to be better is to just receive
[2:21:29] the word of God just be able to take
[2:21:30] this book and eat it up and it'll make
[2:21:33] your belly bitter but it'll be sweet as
[2:21:34] honey in your mouth
[2:21:36] it's a manual dwelling in you with the
[2:21:39] same works that he did
[2:21:42] what were some of the first works that
[2:21:43] he did he went out into the Wilderness

[2:22:57] that father we could recognize that
[2:22:59] there's no great sign or wonder other
[2:23:01] than our ability to believe

[2:23:09] together father and we'll have a new
