worship tonight but let's have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God Amen if you have a unspoken request or a need you can acknowledge it to the Lord with an uplifted hand let's pray Lord Jesus father we lift our hands to you Lord as we do so often Lord and Lord sometimes it's in a surrender Lord father we lift our hands to show Lord that we can do nothing without you Hallelujah and Lord in and then there's times we lift our hands because there's nothing we can do so we put our hands up in Faith Lord praying you would touch that need Lord and Lord there may be needs in the building tonight Lord desires and wants in the building tonight Lord and father we pray Lord that whatever we desire or crave Lord that it will be that of your perfect will amen Lord

nothing can stop it from coming to pass so Lord We Trust You Lord we love you we believ in you to be an all sufficient God lord for you told Paul in his time of trouble and need Lord he came to you Lord earnestly praying and crying for help Lord and you said Paul my grace is sufficient amen hallelujah and we know that that same Grace that sufficient Grace is extended unto us tonight Lord Lord some of us stand here needing the manifestation of Jehovah Gyra but we know you're sufficient in providing Lord Lord some are standing here needing the manifestation of Jehovah RFA but we know you're sufficient in healing Lord and Lord whatever the need is Lord we know that you are sufficient and Lord help our our attitudes to reflect Lord that you are our all in all Lord we just pray father you would just continue to bless the service Lord and Lord forgive us for anything in our life that doesn't bring out who you are Lord and Lord God forgive us for our sins and trespasses Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray church say amen amen somebody say amen amen let's go to Mark the 5th chapter appreciate all the songs that'll be it for the songs of instruments now we're going to worship in the word amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord if you don't mind can I get maybe a tad bit more in the monitors amen uh Mark chapter 5 uh let's start read at verse 24 Mark 5: 24 if you have it say amen amen the Bible says and Jesus went with and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had SP spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched his garments for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of the plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes amen let's go to um Galatians chapter 6 Galatians 6 uh let's start reading at verse 7 Galatians 6 and 7 and then we'll end with Hebrews chap 11 Galatians 6:7 the Bible says be not deceive God is Not mock for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth in his flesh sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth of the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not amen now this is our our verse as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto those who are of the household of faith amen amen amen Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 familiar we can pretty much quote it without turning to it but the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen may the Lord the bless reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God Amen you know tonight you know it's a a what we call a maybe a a off night or a special service but what I want to do by the grace of God I want to challenge you in the service I want to challenge everybody in the service everything that you know and believe about God I want you to believe it can happen in the [Music] serviceall Hallelujah think about what I just said now everything that you know and believe of him what if we would create that kind of atmosphere where everything we've experienced everything that God has done for me now I'm listening to a minister but everything that God has done for me I'm going to put on display that that same God was moving my life in the service yeah amen hallelujah and tonight by the grace of God my my my subject is uh so faith and reap evidence so faith and reap evidence and you know we're going to be talking about you know Faith tonight but uh let's just start by saying what it means to seow Hallelujah when you think about sewing you think about a planting time you know or where you plant in a ground or in a a certain atmosphere wherever you sow you know as a as a as a father you know you seow into your family you know as you're raising children you sew into their life you know you seow what the gospel has done for you and all these different things you seow depending upon believing that what you sow is going to be a manifestation amen hallelujah and the Bible says uh train up a child or raise them up in the way that they should go when they get older it won't depart why because youve sowed the word in their life so we as we sow the kingdom as we seow the word of God we should be looking for the evidences of our faith Hallelujah you know but what does that mean amen there's a law Hallelujah when it comes to Faith you know and and it's an unconscious law Hallelujah you know faith is the substance of things hop for substance of things hop for for it to be a substance it has to be real talk to me church if it's not a substance it's just some Hocus Pocus out there but the Bible says that faith is a true substance and if it's a substance that mean all of us have a right to possess it Hallelujah but you know if I can before I get going Hallelujah I want to you know I've been uh I've been in a in a in a channel where I've been listening to this message perfect Faith over and over and over and over again because he said something in it you know how many knows how rich the word of God is you know you you can hear one man preach about something and then another man come and preach on the same thing and you still get something out of it you know why because the word of God does not get old the word of God does not get stale Hallelujah the word of God it keeps a fresh anointing on it but what what what what makes it live and what makes it move is the way we perceive it Hallelujah right and you know a lot of times we hear things and we're like well you know I didn't heard that before remember I said Put it on display tonight everything that you know of God everything that you believe of God put it on display tonight in the service church and if we could just do that if we could just sow some faith in the service tonight Amen brother J what are you saying I don't want Hallelujah your funny frowns I don't want that tonight amen I don't want your C curious looks or your your your your your your your your angry disposition no I want your faith tonight give me back what God is putting inside of you tonight and if you give me Faith I guarantee you God will y speak out the evidences of what you believe in Hallelujah I think too often we come to church and it's just that it's just church but no this is a meeting between us and our God hallelujah and anywhere God goes anywhere God comes there is a supernatural event hallelujah amen hallelujah you know but uh I was listening to the message and I was thinking about you know what the prophet of God said now listen I want to catch your faith Hallelujah not only what I want to catch it we want to bring our perfect Faith amen because the prophet of God and I'm going to read it the prophet of God said hey we need to get into something that's real let's get to make believe out the church and get into something real and move into real Apostolic times what is Apostolic times the book of Acts Hallelujah where the men of God Walk with the revelation of Jesus Christ and it was an Evidence in their life wherever they went they saw what the revelation of Jesus Christ and the evidences of what they believe Hallelujah became a manifestation and we are no different only thing that makes us different Is How We Believe Hallelujah but look Hallelujah I want you to come along with me tonight by the grace of God he said look he says notice if it is before I get into that let's just talk about the law y'all know me I love talking about the law Hallelujah a bird has a law in it a law to what talk to me now a bird doesn't bark he doesn't have that kind of law in him what does a bird do he flies everybody everybody understands that Hallelujah why that law is evident Hallelujah you can't trick it out of them you can't pull it out of them you can't scare it out of them it's just who he is hallelujah When Storms Come and they tear up Hallelujah cities and and knock down buildings and all these things and Birds Go High when that storm is over that law is still in that bird Hallelujah and it will operate in the storm After the Storm before the storm Hallelujah the trial cannot change the law that was put inside the bird amen hallelujah amen amen amen the storm can't take it away the storm can hinder Hallelujah when it flies but it can't stop it from flying Hallelujah and some birds are so smart and so strong they fly above the storm W Hallelujah you know Church Hallelujah we understand that that bird has a law you can put them up on a cliff Hallelujah and that bird can just fall backwards amen and as it hits it fall it stride those wings come out and that law takes over in that fall amen come on with me now hallah that law takes over in his fall Hallelujah and the fall turns into Hallelujah the evidence of the law inside of it Hallelujah are you with me you know what else has a law inside of it you know one time I I I one of the first trips I went to South Africa you know I hope I don't plan on being long but you know you guys control that I'm about to close but you know Church uh uh one of my first trips to Africa I went to a lion Park and you know uh the L back then you could pet the baby kitten Lions you know breing them up to you and they pet you and bite on your finger you feed them a little whatever it was and and all that stuff and they it was just so cute you know that that that Lion in that little old baby stage he was going now to us to me to everybody looking at that little lion it seemed like it was meing but that wasn't what it was doing it was really roaring W Hallelujah but in his baby stage it was interpreted Hallelujah wrong Hallelujah in the baby stage it was interpreted as a meow but that lion even in that baby stage that was a raw Hallelujah and as it grew and as it GRE GRE and as it got bigger and bigger what it really was the evidence of it started to come out as it matured Hallelujah and now once it got big and the man came out that same NE that you once heard with for five miles but that law was already in it it just had to grow hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and nothing could change or nothing could stop Hallelujah that lion from roaring when the time came brother what are you saying I'm saying that God put a law in us God put a law of faith that will operate when you're Fallen Hallelujah he put a law of faith in you Hallelujah to Roar to cry out when you need something Hallelujah God put a law of faith in us perfect Faith yes sir Hallelujah sir than you Lord Oh Glory everybody all right let's get into it amen amen even Calgary the US and all these places they have laws in the land and as long as you abide by those laws everything will be all right but Hallelujah if you break the law there are certain consequences Hallelujah but in God's kingdom Hallelujah God put a law inside the seed to believe him Against All Odds Hallelujah so what God is trying to get out of us in this end time is the Perfection of what he put inside of us no this is not the time this is not the hour Hallelujah for God to be living out of you in part no now it's time for the fullness of God to be on display cuz Church realize something if we going to go back to it what the prophet of God said it's time for us to get back into Apostolic times Hallelujah the disciples they demonstrated such a faith after the Holy Ghost Came Upon them that when everybody saw them they thought Jesus was still alive that's what your Faith should do W hallelujah oh my your faith should make Christ live amen your faith Hallelujah should become an Evidence of what you believe Hallelujah your faith should be such like Christ Hallelujah that when people look at you they say they must be a Christian Hallelujah the Bible says that they knew these men were ignorant and learned and they took knowledge of them why because they sold faith and they reap evidence hallelujah hallelujah but let's get into it by the grace of God listen he says now now this is going to be the challenge for everybody remember I said take everything you know about God and put it on display tonight has anybody ever been healed amen that God is heal here tonight hallelujah hallelujah amen has anybody ever been encouraged by God that God is here tonight Hallelujah has anybody ever been delivered that God is here tonight now the capping of it all is is anybody filled with the Holy Spirit yeah Glory that God the empowering of who he is is in this service tonight if you could s amen Faith amen hallelujah okay hallelujah we're getting to something amen cuz you know the prophet of God say we live below our means and you know I hardly ever I hardly never preached like this uh uh on asking God you know because we have every scripture not to do it publicly you say no no you know God God you know sometimes I think it' be the devil stopping us from operating in spoken word Authority because we have things we desire of God then and and you want to speak it and the devil will come I I hate to say it's the devil but you know uhh reasoning will come and say well God knows what you stand in need of before you can ask that's right us Lord but then there's another scripture say ask that your joy may be full so which one are you going to listen to do you have a need or not he said ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open unto you Hallelujah but too often Hallelujah we ask and something doesn't happen and then we get discouraged but the scripture says he ask Hallelujah but you don't believe see so are we really sowing faith when we come to God asking Hallelujah amen and even when we asking Church let's realize this there's a law into it Hallelujah he says and it shall be given unto you hallelujah oh my but there's one I love Hallelujah when it when you're dealing with the law of asking God or sowing and reaping Hallelujah there's a scripture Hallelujah I think that we need to understand works for our benefit there's a scripture that says give yeah amen and it shall be given unto you hallelujah oh my that's good and how often God tells us to give to bless one another to do something to S into somebody's life we like Lord I just say I got this I got that I got this I got that instead of you sewing Faith you live in your doubt but the scripture says give and it shall be given unto you Hallelujah and the Bible also speaks about how blessed it is to give amen amen some people don't even realize the only reason why you're blessed is so that you can be a blessing Hallelujah Church let's understand Father Abraham he says I'll bless those that bless you Hallelujah he says I'll bless your going out and I bless your coming in he says Abraham you're blessed to be a blessing Hallelujah and if that was Father Abraham so are we Christianity is what living for others how often are we sowing into somebody else's life and it ain't always about money maybe God puts somebody in your heart and you supposed to sew in their lives in prayer hallelujah how many ever pray for somebody and then you saw him and you saw what you prayed about show faith and reap evidence amen but too often we're thinking about self amen I've seen God do some powerful things when I was in need amen when I was in need God tell me to bless somebody else and it don't make sense Hallelujah y remember one time I was I was I was I was riding up the road was going to preach I was in the and and and I was like Lord I got all these bills I got this I got that now I'm in service I'm not a sinner I'm in my I'm in my duty I'm in my place but I got trials I got tribulation I got needs I need Jehovah Gyra Hallelujah and you know uh uh uh trials don't come because you're a sinner right Trials Come Hallelujah because you're not perfected yet W so every trial Hallelujah is what bringing our deity every trial Hallelujah is getting the dark cold off you why because you're a diamond Hallelujah and you know I was thinking I was like oh my God I might have told this testimony I was like Lord I just you know I just would like to have maybe one month of surplus maybe one month where the bill collectors didn't take it all or I pay everything up and then this new bill just comes from someplace you know and God said to me give I'm like huh I'm praying to you about a blessing you tell me to give what I ain't got let's understand something about God God will sow a word of faith in your life knowing you don't understand it I'll go even deeper knowing you don't even believe it yet amen amen you say really brother digs yes he told Abraham you're the father of faith and you're going to have a child you and Sarah and Abraham didn't even believe it but that didn't stop Hallelujah God's word from in the past what did God do God SW faith into the life of Abraham and Abraham had to come up to that word and producing [Applause] evidence and God does that over and over and over throughout the scriptures he speak a word of faith in his children's life knowing we don't believe it yet Hallelujah true yeah Lord I want Three Squirrels okay I got two everything good God says no you ask for three Hallelujah see he sold it he put it out there and then try to walk away from it God say no you going to get this evidence Hallelujah you say brother why you preaching us tonight because God know that there are needs in the church their financial needs their spiritual needs their healings Hallelujah some some of some of you need to some of you need to sow the spirit of peace amen amen hallelujah look this is not a rebuke it's not a rebuke what I'm preaching tonight is perfect Faith yeah Hallelujah we going to get into it amen listen now we got the law part and everything you know but listen this is what the prophet of God say he says notice it is something that you possess somebody say amen amen he's talking about perfect Faith he say something that you possess not imagination if you really have it it's just as real as you it's just as real as you any other thing that could be it's just as real as you know that you're riding in your automobile amen let me say this you got it how many of you came

voice it's just as real as my voice it's just as real as my voice you being able to respond shows that you can connect to Faith but then he comes and he says faith Hallelujah he said it's a real substance why because faith comes by hearing hearing what the word of God how many of you hujjah are responding to the word of God Amen I got it now what the enemy going to do the enemy going to try to get you to put it on something else well brother you prayed about it and that didn't happen well well you have a sickness in your body and this and that and blah blah blah he don't put it on that amen put it on what you believe AMJ Hallelujah listen how many understands that faith can lay dormant faith has to move faith has to become a verb Hallelujah if it's not a verb is inter intellectual amen it's just knowledge and knowledge is no good because knowledge always tries to prove Faith you can't prove it hallelujah it's something that you have but I can't give it to brother Paul he got to have his own I can't give it a s l she got to have her own amen hallelujah although I got it I can't give it to nobody else what I got is for [Applause] me W go but if I sew into somebody else's life I can see the evidences of what I'm so amen are you with me church now what I want everybody to do is to take your your thinking caps on take them off put them under your feet stump [Applause] on faith has nothing to do with your five senses brother Steve the prophet of God say once your five senses can declare it it's no longer Faith because what the five senses try to do is prove God no we're not here to prove God we're here to believe God hallelujah and if we believe God he'll prove [Applause] himself and then again to prove God you have to S amen yeah cuz you go to Malachi he said SE into the kingdom and you'll be blessed Hallelujah he said prove me and see if I won't open up the windows of Heaven the Bible says pressed down shaken together pressed down means Hallelujah that it can't be moved hallelujah hallelujah real Faith Can't Be Moved it say shaken together no matter what you go through it'll never leave you ask yourself when was the last time your faith was so stimulated you couldn't hardly contain yourself hallelujah amen and what what the Devil comes and says that's just emotion no the prophet of God say stimulation stimulation of what Revelation am faith is a what Revelation Hallelujah I shout because what God has already revealed to me Hallelujah I don't shout because I'm excited I shout because what's been revealed and what's been revealed Hallelujah makes me [Applause] excited Hallelujah I don't sing to get happy I sing because I'm already happy hallelujah it's a revelation listen everybody all right amen he says he says I want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself into the power of God so unless we're operating in this we ain't even in the power of God yet it's just intellectual amen amen you said really brother DS yes y the disciples operated in a level of Faith but it wasn't this Faith we're talking about until the Holy Ghost came amen cuz they healed the sick they raised the dead and when Jesus was gone they denied the faith they couldn't even sew back into the kingdom Hallelujah it wasn't real to them but when the Holy Ghost came what was it a revelation amen first thing Peter says this is that yes sir Hallelujah now he says now let me sww into your life he said what you got to do he said the one y'all crucified the one y'all killed he is the king of glory he's the Lord of lords the all of all and he say Peter what me what must we do now Peter gets to se he says repent and be baptized every one of you and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what did he do he sold into their life what what did he sow their revelation of Faith amen faith in who Jesus Christ amen hallelujah see when it became real after the holy ghost Hallelujah it wasn't just something intellectual I need Jesus standing right beside me for me to operate in this no remember the man Hallelujah at the gate called Beautiful he's sitting there he's needing something he wanted something of the five senses Peter said I don't have that I don't have no money I don't have no gold he said but such as I have Hallelujah such as I have I give unto you and in an unseen real he spoken evidence into his life he said rise up and walk hallelujah what did he touch him with Hallelujah he didn't touch him with his hands he didn't touch him with a needle with a pill with some kind of Remedy what did he touch him with the same thing the woman with the blood issue touched Jesus with it was what a revelation of who Christ [Applause] is in the name of Jesus rise up and walk and the Bible says straight w straight way it became what he sold became what an Evidence then you see them soaring Faith all over the place praying for people they say hey we know this man was blind but now he see amen oh my when it's real evidence is follow amen amen look listen what the word stimulate means even right now what I'm praying this message does tonight amen it stimulate somebody's Faith amen hallelujah now I don't know

devil look church when we think about faith and the stimulation of the spirit is not something that we're trying to make happen right it's a inheritance Hallelujah the Bible says hallelujah without faith it is impossible to please him it's a part of who we are see God wants your faith so bad he wants you to swow it so bad God steps out there he asks a question he says will I find faith when I return what is he talking about Revelation amen okay we going to change gears for a second stimulate means to excite to activate or to growth greater activity H animate arouse how does God do that giving you a trial Hallelujah he allows sister Judi he allows sickness to come why to stimulate your faith right amen he allows SI to come sister said to stimulate your faith to wake it up to excite it to arouse it so it can come on the scene so you can see what's really in you you don't believe it I'm an example of it I didn't know God so what did he do he allowed me to get cancer in my brain knowing that cancer was going to stimulate the revelation of Jehovah Hallelujah and what cancer did is stirred up that Revelation that was inside of me to believe that God Is A Healer are you with me John Hallelujah see God would allow you to go through things just to wake up Hallelujah the presence of Faith that's already lying in you amen yes amen amen bring it on now I didn't even until that moment I didn't even know god I didn't even believe in God so he allow a trial to come Hallelujah something that I couldn't control I just had to believe I had to what I had to swow that Faith back into God and you know what I said I told my mama she said God Is A Healer she said you know what son you've already been healed just like the automobile amen Hall just like sitting in church amen just like the sound my voice she was saying to me son what you need is already in you all you got to do is give it back to God and he will give you the evidence of it and in that moment I said Lord I don't know you but I believe when my mama said prove it to me amen and I walked out of there cancer free and I was over 30 years ago remission what does that mean amen amen came back come back from where when God deals with it he deals with he say your healing will last as long as you [Music] believe amen I wish it would I see I put my same old God right back before it Hallelujah now Satan tried to test my faith in other areas but it's the same Revelation same faith I sold for cancer I sold for diabetes H you sold for heartache you s for for uh depression and all these other things you sow what the revelation of Jesus Christ amen I hope you catching what I'm talking about it ain't something that you work up it's something that you walk with amen one more time I got it got it that would kind of weak got it that would kind of weak let's let's let's make it let's make it like this Hall what if hallelujah what if right here in this blue P strip suit blue shirt whatever color Titus dark skinn wavy hair p right here God was using his flesh to talk to you yes sir amen what if you really knew that what if you really knew God was behind this microphone what if you really knew God was Behind These Hands God was behind his eyes God was behind his voice how would you respond to [Applause] God why think about it if you could see him Church would you be able to keep your composure amen way Hallelujah see that's the differ that's the difference between intellectual faith and something real that's right amen amen glory intellectual Faith or sa yeah brother D I believe that real fa is amen amen that's mine it's all mine it's all mine I'm going to operate in it and nothing's going to stop it from this point on I'm going to put the devil under my [Music] [Applause] feet there's two things that run together Hallelujah when you speaking a perfect Faith hallelujah it's inspiration and revelation amen [Music] amen when was the last time you was inspired I'm going tell you how powerful it is you got the faith he said you just need the power he said you got the power you just need the faith to operate the power amen I'm going tell you what inspiration is how easy it is H you know one day you say I'm going St my business you know what that was that was inspiration now it's a revelation nobody can tell you that you don't have a business Hallelujah every morning you step in position by what faith amen hallelujah the inspiration that you once had has now become what evidence oh my okay let's go to the Bible let's go back to Mark chapter 5 I ain't be too much longer cuz we got a service tomorrow where we can really show out we going to cut up bad for all the people who didn't come tonight amen cuz what when we get there tomorrow we going to have such an expectation of Faith Hallelujah everybody else that didn't come they going to be like what's going on we going to be here like I got it I got it it's here cuz you know what Hallelujah we going to drive here hallelujah we going to sit in church we going to hear the voice and Faith going to happen all over [Applause] again then is going to become what an expectation it's going to be an inspiration Hallelujah Glory listen the woman with the blood issue chapter 5 Mark chapter 5 everybody all right this is powerful to me amen amen you know sometimes I preach and I be like man I need to get the tape cuz what happens when you begin to sew yes sir right Hallelujah when you begin to sow Faith what happened I'm I'm going I'm going amen H Hallelujah listen H this woman the Bible says and Jesus went with him verse 24 and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thrown him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years now look Jesus was going somewhere that wasn't even pertaining to this woman with the blood issue that's right right but she was there yes and while she was there inspiration began to fall am Hallelujah inspiration Begin to Fall how did it fall it fell in a supernatural realm of Faith Hallelujah and while she's there she's watching Jesus and heard all the things he's done now Jesus going to deal with the servant of that other person Hallelujah but she's there and while she's there hallelujah what she heard about Jesus produc Ed and inspiration hallah and now she's being stimulated and something comes in her mind and says if you could touch His Garment you'll be made whole I'm going tell you how powerful that is she didn't have a quote book she didn't have a scripture she didn't have a sermon for a preacher that came fresh Hallelujah out of the revelation of faith but let's take it a step further church that was already in her now the scene came for to become an Evidence and you will walk into certain scenes in your life because God wants to demonstrate the faith that's laying in you and now she's theread she's watching Jesus she's heard all these things cuz Faith come by hearing hearing what the word of God hallelujah listen that's how it works remember when Rahab stepped in position first thing she said is we've heard what your God has done and what was what was she doing she was activating on a level of Faith even though she was a prostitute yeah Hallelujah the sins in your life can't stop that Revelation from coming [Applause] [Laughter] forward who you are is going to come out when the time com nothing go stop it if you belong to God [Music] hallelujah faith is Unstoppable God honors Faith right and I look she says if I could just touch the him of His Garment I'll be made whole oh my she didn't have scriptures like we got she didn't have a a message for that day day like we got she had what inspiration inspiration of the blood Hallelujah but that always was in the body of [Music] Christ inspiration is here tonight God is challenging somebody to believe hallelujah hallelujah she wasn't the first one to catch the inspiration of the blood Hallelujah and if you catch it you'll get the same results okay remember there were two brothers that God said hey I want y'all to go worship today the names were Cain and Abel and Hallelujah and Abel's Revelation was something pretty and fruitful that was his inspiration of God something pretty and fruitful but Hallelujah but Abel Hallelujah right Abel's inspiration was hey I'm going to go get this lamb it look ridiculous I'm going to go get this lamb and I'm going to take it Hallelujah and everything he begin to do from that point begin to show his Revelation he grabs a lamb which is what a type of Christ fruit as there's no fruit in the Bible that God uses as a type of him that's right amen Kan was completely lost completely out of there H he's getting fruits and plants and all this stuff none of that was a type of the inspiration of God none of that was a type of God now here comes Abel able does what he grabs a lamb that's the type of God his inspiration begin to pick it up Hallelujah his inspiration begin to pick it up he picked up the lamb Hallelujah in church Hallelujah he had to kill the lamb so what did he do he grab a rock another type of God Rock of AG that go CL me he said I am the stone that the builders rejected Hallelujah now look at Abel Hallelujah inspiration is picking up everything that God is in his time of sowing amen hallelujah in his time of worship he picked up the lamb Hallelujah he picked up it had to be blood and he grabbed a rock hallelujah everything is typing out Christ he begins to hack him up H what does he doing he's picking up that blood is the only thing that can forgive sin amen and mama and daddy didn't even tell him about what was he doing he was picking up years later what Christ was going to tell Peter amen amen oh boy faith is in here tonight all kind of stuff is coming Hallelujah I couldn't even stud it for this it's just coming inspiration is falling hallelujah look Church Hallelujah begin to pick up what Jesus Hallelujah asked them a question of he says who do men say I am Hallelujah he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and then Jesus said Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you what was he saying Adam and Eve did not reveal this to you amore how know about y I feel stimulated some might walk out of here somebody throw me a purse of $110,000 so so I got to receive Hallelujah Oh my he says Flesh and Blood have not revealed this to you Hallelujah the same thing Hallelujah that Abel caught by inspiration Adam and Eve did not tell him who God was Hallelujah it was inspiration by Revelation and he picked it up let me say this we going to jump way out there on the limb now we some of us we've had it wrong we've been saying we've been thinking brother Brandon revealed us uhuh amen no he didn't he was just the messenger remember Jesus said Flesh and Blood have not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven brother brother was just a mouth PE just like Adam was the mouse PE in his house GL Jesus is the only one that's why I can't give you the revelation of faith it has to be revealed to you but look this woman she said if I can just touch to him on his gar yes I'll be made whole H so she

what it was something that hadn't been done before yes sir amen oh my hallelujah what Happ happens when you sow Faith back to God catch me I'm about to close now she's coming to God with faith if I could just touch the him of His Garment and the prophet of God says it wasn't his clothes the Natural Touch of his clothes that she touched she touched him by faith believing in who he is because the Bible says he's a rewarder of those that disly seek Him Hallelujah those of us that believe that God is hallelujah and in her time of inspiration something came to her that God Is A Healer and all you have to do is touch the him of His Garment and as she touched the him of His Garment Hallelujah everybody else was touching him too but they wasn't touching by faith and when she touched Jesus said who touched me that's how I feel tonight Jo somebody in here touching me oh amen touching me I feel a strong pull Deliverance in the buildings Hallelujah I feel a touch of Faith Hallelujah hallu ask

every obstacle from human being that they might be connected like the Garden of Eden now man he said I was going to choke it basically he said I wasn't going to say this he said I was going to choke it he said but I'm going to say it amen man is [Music] omnipotent Hallelujah see that hasn't been revealed to some of you Hallelujah because I said that and some of you were like man is omnipotent omnipotent means all powerful you were created to be all powerful notice the Bible says Adam was created in the image and likeness of godall Hallelujah Hallelujah jesusall what does that mean brother DS oh my what are you saying all I can do is repeat the Revelation amen and the Revelation that's been revealed to me is brother M when you see me you see the [Music] father my Hallelujah there is a piece of you and him hallelujah hallelujah so when we see him we see the father Hallelujah and we can see it naturally why should we be able to see it spiritually so I can speak as a son when you see me you see the father Glory oh my I feel the faith in here oh I feel the supernatural faith in here tonight we've been living below our means Man was created to be omnipotent Oh my he said man am man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is what makes you omnipotent a man fully surrendered to [Music] God sir yes I'm going prove it to you you know how you wh a tape and take when you're rewinding make that funny noise when you're going backwards I'm winding this message I will would like to be home drinking Kool-Aid maybe a Coca-Cola eating a Snicker bar but something said to me you need to go to Calgary so I forget about sitting home and do what become fully surrender to God am amen I don't care how you look at me I believe I'm omnipotent I believe all power of God is in me church I want you to understand Hallelujah when you see me you see the pyramid Hallelujah go the pyramid the character of God is inside the seed Hallelujah you see virtue tious me brotherly kindness Hallelujah you see it all in the body of Christ so I could say when you see me you see the father amen amen fool anybody in here fully surrender your life is not your own oh my some of us in here we could have been something big in the world but we forsook that Hallelujah to be what Christ wanted us to be some of us oh my oh look I probably got about two more times I'm about to close he said a man fully surrendered is to God is omnipotent and not he said in Mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you say he says listen what happens when two omnipotents meet hallelujah what is the two omnipotence now we're sewing this is your chance to give that faith God gave you back to him amen he said this is what happened when two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together to omnipotence something's got to shake amen when you give back to God the same faith that he gave to you what is that that's a Clash of the Titans so something supernatural has to take place because Faith don't push back faith faith compliments faith amen oh my oh my listen and I'm going close with this that's when two positives meet see that's when two omnipotents meet see when one omnipotent she the prophet of God is saying that that woman with the blood issue was omnipotent right what made her omnipotent her faith hallah listen omnipotent she had now this blew me away when I read this he said she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ amen so if she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was that omnipotent Faith she's giving back to Christ she's swing back to Christ what he gave her so it had to produce an Evidence in her life amen amen but he didn't stop there he called her faith omnipotent perfect omnipotent Faith she C it by the inspiration she app Ed Hallelujah faith without works is what dead what good is an inspiration if you don't put it into motion amen hallelujah look he say she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see oh you come a bom I want you to get out your big gloves I ain't talking about a regular glove I want everybody to be a goalie right now you know they got some B glov on those gloves are a little bit bigger than a baseball glove that's right cuz it's coming in Fast and hard yes sir Hallelujah and you got to you got to be able to catch it you got to be able to receive the impact and keep going H amen so I want everybody to get out their big spiritual gloves he said Hallelujah he said she had perfect omnipotent faith and he was omnipotent see she had perfect infinite Faith amen o Hallelujah you've never heard that word infinite used on human beings God is the only one that's infinite so for her to have infinite faith it must be the faith of [Applause] God and when you Hallelujah have infinite faith and you're giving that Faith to the infinite one you have to receive what you're asking for amen that's right you have to receive an Evidence amen hallelujah come musicians I'm coming come on I'm closing come musicians she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was Lord and KN whatever he asked God God would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word amen amen that's what what perfect Faith does yes sir it always speaks the word back over itself amen you just speak the word that's all you have to do and whatever you ask God God will give it you amen so faith and receive evidence but I love the scripture in Galatians 6 back and read it cuz sometimes we miss we miss what the inspiration is all about amen the Bible says be not deceived whatsoever you sow you shall reap if you sow good you reap good if you sow bad you reap bad because an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit that's right Hallelujah and a good a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit hallelujah amen so you reap what you sow and church look at the scripture the one that jumps out to me where it says verse 7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not amen Church don't be weary in the trials of life amen those trials are there to stimulate your faith amen amen cuz remember there's levels there's levels of Faith Hallelujah but what we want we want to give back to God his very own faith amen Hallelujah but this is the verse verse 10 as we have therefore opportunity we all have an opportunity tonight amen let us do good unto men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen we have an opportunity to do good to one another amen we have an opportunity to sew into one another's life right amen hallelujah whether it be naturally or spiritually but let the inspiration of God catch [Music] you and be that one fully surrendered and let the omnipotence of God take over Church we're not just church members amen he said he said let's get the unbelief out the church and move into something powerful move into something real h amen if he said that in this message that mean there's a level for us that we haven't obtained yet but it's here remember when that tree is this big everything that it will ever produce is already in it that's right amen so Brother D what are you saying God doesn't have to give you more faith amen amen it's already in you Hallelujah there just has to be more stimulation more Awakening hallelujah what makes a tree grow Hallelujah Sunshine water and [Music] storms you can't leave out the trials the trials make the tree grow amen cuz you know when the storms begin to blow what does it do it makes the roots grow deeper and as the roots grow deeper the TRU continues to grow amen hallelujah so what we have to do we have to get to the place where we say thank God for my trials I tell brother Barry Barry picked me up he said brother how you doing I said well praise God I said you know what I've gotten to the place now no matter what it looks like all I'm going to say is like job blessed be the name of the Lord am you can say well I know he going through this and I'm going to respond to you blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah a't God good church the supernatural Faith Of God is in here tonight amen hallelujah is in here to call us for High your walking amen let's stop letting Satan beat us up he don't belong in your face amen he don't belong in
