you come oh last verse oh Jesus your name is Holy oh Jesus your name brings light oh Jesus your name it's above [Music] um we have a special song to do um but if I may just quickly tell us the story behind the song It's a song that we know and we sing and we have known for a long time but there is actually a very interesting story about this song and it has to do with um a man in India who believed the word of God from the Baptist um missionaries that had gone to India it was part of a tribe and this was about 150 years ago and um because he made his decision to follow Jesus uh the chief of the tribe um and the rest of the tribe started to persecute him and uh at some point they asked him to renounce Jesus and if he wasn't going to they were going to kill his family and he said he wasn't going to um and they started to kill each of the family members he said the cross before me the World Behind Me no turning back and he had to eventually pay with his life and maybe we don't have to go through that but every day in our lives we make decisions and we make decisions whether to follow Jesus or not but I just pray that every time we remember this song We Remember the story behind the song and realize that we all have to make that decision to follow Jesus every day of our life we're going to do the first two verses as instrumental and they will'll invite you to join us to you know sing the rest of it God bless you [Music] the a [Music] a [Music] I have J [Music] [Music] me the world [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you Jesus this [Music] [Applause] J J [Music]

friend of mine his name is Jonathan and I'd just like to hold him before the throne and just ask that he would be able to find the same delivering power that I once was able to find also want to remember Jesse and Michelle distant family members Jesse is about 30 years old and has a booming business a little girl and uh had a headache and went to the doctor and they sent him to emergency and the doctor's prognosis is terrible we just want to ask that the Lord would intervene there as well let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord I'm so thankful that you're already here Lord Jesus we've called upon your name we've followed your instruction and gathered together in your name and we know that you're here in our midst father Lord we could scream and shout and that won't make any difference because we know that your ear is always open to our prayer and Lord not in a way that you're in a different dimension listening to us on some kind of a device but we know that you are in our very heart hearts Lord and when we are sons and daughters that Lord we truly have your mind inside of us and Lord that when we truly are in that position that it's not even us that speaks father this morning we're so thankful that we can have that intimate of a relationship with you and Lord we know that you know these needs that were made known unto you this morning by way of an uplift hand father you knew about those needs before the foundation of the world before there even was a speck of Stardust you knew those needs would come forward this morning and we just commit them into your hands Lord father we want to remember Jesse and Michelle the entire family Lord we know the doctor's report yes Lord but father we just want to hear from you Lord we pray that Jesse would be able to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection as well father we know we read that story about that woman from rhasia who was a Muslim and that Lord she followed the Islamic faith all of her life yes she did but Lord one time one place one season she came into your presence yes Lord Lord she never met a man that day we just want to remember Jesse and Michelle father we want to remember Jonathan Lord far be it from us Lord Jesus to think that this great salvation is just for us help us Lord to find the lost sheep Lord help us Lord to try and impart this eternal life to others Lord oh Father not to just seek you for the blessings in our lives Lord but to desire to see lost souls saved yes Lord father we pray that you would just bless them Father pray that we could hold them before your throne Lord Jesus that somehow someway something would happen father according to your will Lord we love you and we thank you we just want to ask that you would bless our service now father each one who has made the effort to come out Lord maybe those who are tuning in those who might watch after pray that you would just bless each one abundantly father above all that we could ask or think through this service today we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians thank you everyone for the specials such wonderful gifts in the body here certainly is tremendous we uh just have a couple of scriptures that I'd like to read one out of St John chapter 6 and then one out of First Corinthians chapter 2 St John 6 1 Corinthians chapter 2 we just have one birthday to report for this week that's sister Michelle livsey that's on the 19th God bless you Sister happy [Applause] birthday St John chapter 6 two verses verse 53 and verse 54 St John 6:53 says then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day over in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we just invite your spirit invite you Lord Jesus to search our hearts Lord to search our minds father Lord to search us and try us today by your word father and Lord we just ask that you would just pour out your spirit upon each and every one of us father that the revelation of Jesus Christ would become so profound to us that we would have such a god Consciousness every single moment of Our Lives Lord when we wake up in the morning that we would think about you father where we're going to take you during the day where you're going to take us father the people that we're going to talk to Father the experiences that we'll experience father will be with you and when we lay our head down at night father help us to give thanks Lord Jesus for the day that you've given us and Lord that father we just we just love you and we thank you we just Commit This service now into your hands and all that we say For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated today just a couple of announcements we have the Youth Event this afternoon after service and uh I believe that's already ready arranged so God bless you I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the children to get together the youth to get together and uh if you ever run out of things to pray for which I don't think is entirely possible but if you ever do just remember the youth because if the devil has one one Target in mind it's the youth he wants to take the youth and try and dangle the shiny things before their eyes he wants to try and talk to the youth through friends and and Associates and and say to them do you really go to church do you do you really go and do that on Sunday why don't you come and hang out with us we're going to go skiing we're going to go snowboarding we're going to go and do the fun things in the world maybe we're going to go to a party maybe we're going to do all these different things I can tell you by witness I'm I'm a living witness that the devil is going to lead you down a path of Destruction the devil is going to take the children and lead them to a place where they're going to wish they never went to by experience I can tell you that but hey we're not living there we have the delivering power of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives and we're certainly thankful we're not here to glorify the devil we're here to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ but if you ever run out of anything to pray for I tell you the youth needs our prayer we have a communion service coming up on the 31st a communion testimony service and uh as mentioned I'm sure there would be room for specials if there was one or two we didn't want to really do a whole special service but if we have a couple that would certainly be a wonderful thing that's on the 31st and then we won't have a service on the 1st which is a Wednesday because uh of the service on the 31st you happy this morning we uh last time we we ministered which actually was a little while ago um we spoke on Revelation the importance of Revelation and I I want to speak on the importance of Revelation today too as a maybe a part two and uh I want to I want to speak on it maybe I I I I don't know if there's a maybe that's the text and this would be the context um call it perfect realization perfect realization is really what what Revelation is and uh it's it's the realization of something that's not just true or false it's the actual explanation of it it's it's the idea becoming real to us individually you know I I just wanted to pick up from where we left off before it's been a little while we had uh what a tremendous service last week did you enjoy that service with brother gift my let's cause confusion in the camp of the enemy I mean just living our lives every single day that we get up we will cause confusion in the camp of the enemy because we won't be attracted by what he has in terms of traps in our lives you know in uh in John chapter 6 the disciples in verse 25 um when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed remember you are what you eat I say Lord help me not feed on the things of this world help me just remain focused on your word let me eat and feed upon the word because the more I eat it the more I become it you know last week we talked about the importance of Revelation I'm not going to read the whole quote just a little snippet from it were you able to get the uh email beautiful the exposition of the seven Church ages brother bradam he says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be overemphasized that means I could preach on it every single service Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you not the Book of Revelation in the Bible even though it's a very important study he's not talking about that what he's speaking about is I'm talking about all Revelation is tremendously important to the church so I just want to try and maybe do a little recap from where we were last time I didn't really even get into the quotes where I wanted to get to last time um but we just trust the Lord you know we talked about Peter and and how Peter he he he had such an experience with the Lord a as Jesus began to to come into his ministry we know that he Jesus he actually Jesus came and found Peter fishing he had toiled all night and nothing was happening he was pretty frustrated things weren't going well for him and and we know that Peter actually had to have that Encounter With Jesus so that Jesus could say to him you know just just let me your boat for a sec I I just have to to speak to the people I can't really get in front of them properly so just if you don't mind just allow me your boat and uh we'll see what happens and we know Peter was probably in a a little bit of a foul mood at the time just surmising he he maybe wasn't that happy but he he did in the end relent and and said okay sure take my boat you know nothing's happened I can't catch any fish anyway so you might as well use it for something useful in Luke Chapter 5 and it came to pass that as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of ganat and and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed of him that he would Thrust out a little bit from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we've toy all the night we've toiled all night long we've done everything we can and have taken nothing but here there was something inside of Peter Simon that didn't really know Jesus at the time but there was something in him to say nevertheless at Thy word now if you recall on Wednesday we're talking about the word and and the importance of the word and making the word Paramount not looking for signs and wonders not looking for eloquence not looking for all of the things that this world looks for in terms of churches and church bodies and theology Etc what we want to do is do exactly that nevertheless Lord at Thy word if your word says that I should do this then I'm going to do it that's all there is to it I'm not going to try and make an excuse for it and say wow no we're not interested in that we're only interested in saying nevertheless at Thy word and and I can just say to anyone Again by experience if you've never done that before and you really want to see whether God is God try it once we read the quote last time just try it one time for real and see if he is not God and Simon answering said unto him Master we've toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and I just think it's so beautiful the scripture here and when they had this done they enclosed a great m multitude of fishes and their net break so much that they couldn't even contain it doesn't that sound like another scripture in Malachi chapter 3 amen and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship so that they could come and help them and they came and filled both ships so that they began to sink not just one ship didn't just break one net I I think it's so wonderful the way God pours out a blessing don't you how he will make sure that there are witnesses to his life to his work it is not a private Affair even though the third pull it's it's private sure enough it is but that doesn't mean other people around won't see what's going on and say what is causing that to happen how could that possibly be when Simon Peter sought something happened in this man didn't it he fell down at jesus' knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord Lord why because he was astonished and all that were with him at the jot of fishes which they had taken something happened naturally God knows exactly where we are exactly what we're going through and exactly when we're going through it there no surprise he's not surprised I remember hearing brother Ken say it he's not up in heaven ringing his hands wondering oh my how is this going to work out I never anticipated that happening God knew all about it before the foundation of the world and he's just waiting to see what we're going to do amen are we going to put him first are we going to put his word first are we going to say nevertheless at Thy word we know the doctor has a word we know the nurse has a word sometimes we even know the pastor has a word but what is the word of God that's the ultimate brothers and sisters you know Peter he had lots of experiences with the Lord he had the opportunity to go to mount Transfiguration I know there's a really deep preaching on this and I'm not going to go there today but we know that when he was there something happened in his life turn with me quickly over to Matthew chapter 17 if you don't mind Matthew chapter 17 we still have lots of time so I just want to try and do this pick up from where we were last time verse one of Matthew chapter 17 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment as white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus lord it's good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their feet faces and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise Be not Afraid and and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell no tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them now it doesn't say that Jesus explained this part to him so this is the part that I want to get to Jesus simply told them about Elias he referred back to the word he pointed directly back to the scripture that they would do whatsoever they listed and they knew that Elias must first come that's why they asked him but but wasn't Elias supposed to come first and then verse 13 then the disciples they understood what happened was they got a revelation God allowed them to get a revelation and it wasn't just a private interpretation it was actually known by all three of them in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established I think it's so beautiful the way the Lord does it so he allowed the disciples to actually get a perfect realization of what the scripture was saying now I'm not just going to dwell there we're going to bounce back and forth I think it's beautiful in our day isn't it how we've been given the opportunity to receive a revelation about the word for our day and not just a revelation where we can say it's been revealed to me but just an absolute perfect realization about not just the word about not just a prophet that was sent from God about who we are amen a perfect realization about what it means to be a husband not just a partial Revelation or realization a perfect realization about what it means to be a wife oh my because we talk about being the Bride of Jesus Christ we must have an absolute perfect revelation of that one I think it's wonderful and you know what if we don't pray that the Lord would give us one because if we ask for the right things he'll give them to us we just have to make sure we ask for the right things James told us that didn't he we can just wind up asking a Miss because we just ask for the things in this flesh and this life consume it upon the lust that we live I want a new house I want new paint on my house I know new car I want some new shoes man I want some really nice custommade leather shoes all these things that don't matter amen the only thing that matters is what's going to happen to us when we die but when we get that part fixed I think something happens something tremendous happens it gives us a burden for the Lost gives us the the desire to see other people saved the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist I think it's so beautiful again there's more scripture we could get into I'm not going too too far today we're talking about Peter and how God used him how how God used him to to actually Express himself to and through we know that there was many things that happened in his life we know there was a time when Peter began to rebuke Jesus Jesus was telling them that you know the son of man has to be lifted up and and and suffer all these things and Peter he jumped in and said no no no not on my watch I know we talked about this last time I'm just trying to refresh us on on on the thoughts and and Jesus he turned to him and he didn't say Peter you need to change your thinking you need to change what you're talking about you need to get in line with the word he got right to the heart of the matter he went right to the root of the problem didn't he he just said Satan get behind me get behind me because you don't Savor the things of the Lord you're busy savoring the things of this world a and and the devil is going to come and try and use us any way he can to try and encourage us to get mixed up and and maybe just a little bit off one way or the other he doesn't care whether you're Ultra religious or whether you're a rank sinner he doesn't care whether you're one way or the other because either way is maybe just a little bit wrong the ultra religious is just Ultra covered I've got the biggest and the best fig Leaf of the bunch I've been to theology school maybe I'm I'm a I'm a theologian maybe I've actually understand more than most people do the devil doesn't care what way we go just so long as we don't put that word first when we put that word first in our lives something happens it causes us to see the unlocking of the formula and that's why what happened in the Garden of Eden is such a mystery I know we talked about it last time too but what really happened in the Garden of Eden did they just eat some fruit and all of mankind fell all of the animals had to perish all of creation had to fall and and and go through all of the problems that creation is going through now and has been since just because of a a fruit now some would say well they disobeyed God's word and sure enough they did but they disobeyed God's word word to actually do something and and when they did that it caused the entire fall of mankind but if we put God's word first the devil can't get to us and that's where I want to go today with us brothers and sisters to encourage us to remember that we have been given not just a partial Revelation we've been given the full Revelation not just about the message of the hour in terms of a a knowledge-based understanding of the message of the hour but we have been given the perfect realization through the message of the hour about who we are and I keep going this way for a purpose because once we recognize what we are then the Rapture will go amen that's what's going to happen that's what we're expecting that's the only thing that's left as a promise for the Gentile church is the rapture to take place and any just any day now just any moment my it's so beautiful going back to our scripture this morning in John John 6 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day and we can look at this and say you know there's there's lots of different things that we've heard about in in the age in which we live in there's there's people that that just worship the ideology of vampires and not going to go into that but I know brother Bram he talked about vampire he said they they think I'm a vampire by saying that so that's the reason I'm talking that way I'm not trying to bring anything strange to us but but the whole ideology of the vampire has become glorified in the age in which we live and that's terrible because it's a mockery of this that's what that is it's not just an evil Theory um by the way men behave or or women behave human beings behave because they're under the influence of a spirit it's absolutely a mockery of what Jesus Christ the word made flesh spoke when he stood on Earth there was only one that were supposed to eat his flesh and drink his blood but brother bradam he brought it and said you know these Ultra religious in his day they were stuck in their traditions and they couldn't recognize the the one who stood before them they couldn't understand it because they were stuck in their ways and we know that that corner was turned but when he was standing right there he said that for a reason brother Brandon brings it out he says he did it for the reason that he needed to thin the people out because there's some people that are going to get the perfect realization of the revelation of the word and there's some people that won't and those people who will will get it and I remember thinking when I first started coming to the message church this is kind of strange there's a lot of profit there's a lot of Eagle there's a lot of cloud there's a lot of mystery there's seals there's all these different things that are kind of strange and had me scratch in my head wondering what what what is it all about but I knew in my heart even though I couldn't understand it at the time there is something about it and that's where I want to say to anyone today if you've got any doubt about this don't say anything about it just say I don't understand it and if you would like to understand it ask God himself to reveal it to you because takes someone with that kind of power to reveal it we can only talk about it but it takes God to reveal it but when he reveals it we become perfected with that perfect realization it's such a beautiful thing I just love it out of the exposition of the seven Church ages in the Philadelphian Church age brother brandham he says this oh I am so glad that my Holiness is not of myself how many people could say that this morning I am so glad glad that my Holiness is not of myself I am glad I am in Christ but not just in Christ I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things saith he that is true now this word is true it's a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven excuse me John 151 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for US 1 John 2:8 because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect real realization against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before antitype contrast with type and substance with Shadow take the example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven I love that whereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality you no longer you need no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God just love this this this this I love the message don't you just amazing how how clear it becomes we we don't need a shadow anymore we don't need to have a mystery anymore we don't need to have types anymore even though we do teach and preach from them we we we we try and impart the reality of the word of God to each and every one of us and we know that that word in our day is Jesus Christ that word is the perfect realization of what the message of the hour actually is the reason that God sent us a prophet in the day in which we live is for the perfect realization I would like to get into talking a little bit about our scripture in First Corinthians just just looking at it through the lens of the realization the perfect realization about who we are if we could just read this this chapter here I know it's a lot of reading but we still got a bit of time and what better thing to to do than just read the word of God Amen but in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 Paul speaking to the Corinthian Church here and he says and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified now remember Paul was trained up under Gia wasn't he he was a Hebrew of Hebrew amen he was an Israeli he was a Jew he understood the word like not many people did in his day he was I would say a Pharisee and a sadducee all in one he knew the word of God and and and he came not with the Excellency of speech what he saying here many times we can look at it and and read it and just maybe gloss over it this is a man that actually really understood the law and we know that the scholars from that day I wonder if Paul would have been part of that group we've heard it said that you could roll the scroll they knew it so well that they could pierce the scroll through with a pin and then open the scroll before they opened it they could tell you exactly what scripture was pierced that's how well they knew it I wonder if Paul was a part of that group and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom all the eloquence and all my training was out the door amen declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determin not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but a demonstration of spirit and Empower isn't that wonderful that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and you know brothers and sisters today I think that's probably one of the most important things that I feel led to talk about is to make sure that our faith is not standing in the wisdom of men sometimes we can have favorite Ministry sometimes we can have a favorite Pastor sometimes we can have our ideas but let's not let our ideas Fall upon men because if we do that we're going to actually go astray our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and the only way we're going to see the power of God manifest in our lives is to put his word first his word has got to go first that is the Paramount how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect isn't that beautiful it's almost contradictory to the the scripture that he said there in verse 5 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory there has to be someone that is able to understand this mystery and I think it's so beautiful it's the mystery of who we are the Tabernacle not made with hands the Tabernacle that God has chosen we know in the in the Old Testament there's the Tabernacle that was made in the wilderness and for the sin of the people God went through all of the instruction to build the Tabernacle and very specific instructions on how to build the instruments in the Tabernacle in the tent how to weave everything together all the Skins the colors of the Skins all of the very specific details on how to create the Ark of the Covenant and the and the holes for the the staves to fit through and how it should be made out of that type of wood shittum wood I think it's called and then how it should be overlaid with gold inside and out and and how it should bear the testimony of the word of God inside it but there should also be Angels on the top with their wings facing in so that he would actually call that The Mercy Seat that he would rest above the word for his day all of the very specific instruction was given to them to have a place for the Lord and here we are today brothers and sisters we've just been freely given that position and all we have to do is surrender it back to him and he will come and abide in The Mercy Seat of our heart am I think it's so beautiful how brother Bram brought it out in the 60s to say maybe it was the 50s but he brought it out to say in his ministry that science has proven that there is a teeny little space in the heart of a human and there isn't that space in any other animal in creation why is that he said it was the space for the soul and that's the only thing that God's interested in so I want to say this out of all of the glory that man was instructed to create in the wilderness in the Tabernacle and the gold and Angels the cherubims to Bear their wings and and to have that beautiful mercy seat behind the veil where only the high priest could go into that that sacred place he's put in the heart of every single human being and alls we have to do now through the revelation of the word for our day through the perfect realization is just open that little tiny space in our heart and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word come and fill that space in that little void it's in my heart and isn't it amazing when we look around in this world that that tiny little space could be so thirsty so hungry drive people to act so crazy what we would say crazy to chase alcohol to chase women to chase money to chase all the fame and stuff that this world would do to chase Sports all of these things that people do in this world that teeny little space in the heart is what's driving them they're thirsting they're thirsting for the things of the Lord and they don't even know it but here we are we know it and we're so thankful that we can fill it with the right things whoa my verse seven but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory they would not have done it because then we wouldn't have salvation would we but as it is written eye hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but I just love this next verse because if we just looked at verse n i i I looked at it for years and thought my there's such a wonderful place that we just will never know about until we cross over and true indeed much of it we won't know about but isn't it interesting that verse 10 says but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God maybe why wise brother Barry gets so excited when he reads that because I think you know brother Bram he tells the vision about when he went beyond the curtain of time amen didn't he and that's no different from Paul we talked about that maybe uh last year or somewhere along the way that Paul he was caught up into heaven and he heard unspeakable words that he was wasn't lawful for him to repeat but yet in our day our Prophet was caught up into heaven and he actually came back with a report didn't he he came back with a report saying that everyone was in perfect health everyone was happy everyone was actually about 20 years old and everyone had the same idea of the faith because he said can I see Jesus and the voice said to him no he's a little higher you can't see him yet and he said well yeah I can't remember I'm getting mixed up now but Paul he said does Paul have to be judged for what he taught and they said yep and he said well I preach what Paul preached and all of those voices that were there who were his converts in the vision what did they say they said we're resting on that this isn't a mystery brothers and sisters God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God for what a man knoweth for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God and I I just think it's so just dovet tales with what we've said and we'll continue to say you know we have got to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives now some people might get upset when they hear me say that again but brothers and sisters we're in a one room Schoolhouse we heard that a long time ago there's some people that are old veterans grandmas and grandpas of the message of the hour will call them they've had the Holy Ghost for so long and I just can't help but think of that story where brother Bram says to that sister sister how long has it been since you've had the Holy Ghost and she says bless God I remember I've had the Holy Ghost way back when I don't know the exact date but she never got upset why would anybody get upset when you talk about the Holy Ghost we should be able to say it loud and clear have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believe since you call yourself a Believer have you got the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters I want to say it today if we can't say I know I got the Holy Ghost I think there's a little bit of work to do maybe not a lot alls it is is surrender open that little space in your heart that he created for himself and say Lord I want that Holy Ghost for myself I'm tired of looking around and seeing all the other people having the joy I'm tired of seeing all the other people having the victory in their lives bring some to me Lord the only way it happens is with surrender though full complete surrender say God if your God be my God and I promise you if you're honest he will be you know I was so thankful I was I was sharing with my friend I hope it's okay just a little bit of my testimony you know when I came into this message when I came 2005 July 27 I I came to an upper room and I I can say I had an upper room experience and I know we all can say that somewhere along the way in our lives but the Lord just made it so vivid so real to me and and you know what we can only deal with the way the Lord has spoke to us and that's my testimony and I just have to express it the way that he's given it to me but you know I I went into that upper room as a full-time smoker I went into that upper room as an alcoholic I was at the place in my life where I didn't know how to deal with either one because both of those had a grip of my life they were being used to try and fill that teeny little void in my heart and I had no idea what was going on why I was doing all of that and of course I'd heard it I had heard it I'd heard about Jesus I'd heard about how he died i' I grew up in Pentecost I heard about all that but wasn't real to me I never had a perfect realization I never had a revelation about it and you know I want to say this real clear too when I was in that service I I mentioned a little bit earlier I didn't understand that God sent a prophet I didn't understand all of the the the message theology all of the Mysteries and all of the stuff about it but what I did know is there was a God and I did know that through the words that were being spoken there was something different about this atmosphere there was something totally different than I'd ever heard in my life and you know what happened in that service was I just gave my heart to the Lord I I didn't have a prayer meeting there wasn't any lightning bolts or thunder the the walls never shook there was no visible signs there was no sensation but something happened in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I actually began to perceive that there was going to be a Rapture because what happened brothers and sisters was my body started to change I no longer craved cigarettes and I no longer drank both of those were gone in a twinkling of an eye they weren't gone because I went to God and said oh God I just can't stop smoking help me Lord I can't stop drinking oh I just can't stop doing this no no no that's not how the battle was won the battle was won with full Surrender by saying I'm tired of playing around I don't want a fake religion I want to know if there's a God and if there's a God be my God and I can tell you brothers and sisters whatever the problem is in your life if you got one just get real with God and see if he won't change your life you know we talked about this a while ago I think it's so beautiful the Rapture is a revelation brother Bram said this seventh angel messenger said the Rapture is a revelation the change of our bodies is a Revelation and you know when we see the body change it's only the final tiny little portion of what we've been going through all the way along because the word says let this mind that was in Christ be also in you so we begin to become his attributes our body begins to change we no longer try to fill that teeny little void in our hearts with all of the things of this world what happens is we get the right food we understand that there's a right way and when we actually repent we say Lord I know I'm a sinner I was born in sin I was shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Lies when we do that then we actually surrender our life to him then he can come in and begin to change our bodies isn't that what he does he changes our bodies he gives us a body change right here and and all that happens is we just get more and more and more changed I can't help but think about brother meno's dream that he told about seeing his sister I think it was his sister and what happened was he wound up just taking steps and he was going higher and higher and higher and high isn't that the life of a Christian whoever the oldest one in the building is I I would say this as a believer of the word of God are you the same person you were yesterday you're continually changing we're always changing conforming to the word word but not just conforming as the world says conforming we are actually being transformed by the word it's not us that's doing it but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit verse 10 for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so if we don't have the spirit of God if we don't know that we got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives how are we ever going to understand the message of the hour it's only going to be the wisdom of man that's all it will ever be will become a message Theologian and that will be that and you know that ain't enough to take us in the Rapture that's why I'm talking the way I'm talking brothers and sisters it's not to try and belittle anybody for knowing a lot about the message of the hour I want to say do you know the author of the message of the hour do you know the god of William Mariam brandham because you have to it's not optional amen William bradam never came to Calvary though there's a deity spirit that wants to get people down that road of believing that he did somehow uhuh no way no no no verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God my now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of of God so I want to say this brothers and sisters if that's where we find ourselves what do people see when they see us are we are we are we advertising the Lord Jesus Christ or are we advertising the world and our lives demonstrate who we are our lives show the life that we're living verse 13 says which things also we speak not in The Words which man wisdom teacheth but with the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned that's the only way we can understand what's being preached brothers and sisters is by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives now many times things can be spoken from the pulpit or from a tape when we're playing it or even just in conversation where you're pouring from cup to vessel to vessel right where you're fellowshipping around the word the Lord speaks to us but the only way that we can perceive it is to have his Spirit otherwise we'll be one of those people that goes to church and say I never got nothing in fact he called me a crow and others will go and be like Hallelujah glory to God I heard from my theophany I know that I'm an eagle cuz I'm not walking out of here I'm flying out of here depends on which spirit you got in you there's two Spirits the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist spirit and we know that brother bradam said the Antichrist Spirit would creep into what framework of the Christian church and cause it to become lukewarm formal oh my don't be shouting now don't be getting too excited keep it down I came here I just want to be able to hear and Powerless powerless powerless when the Devil comes around and tries to shake Our Lives Shake our existence we'll be powerless to deal with them don't let that anyti Christ Spirit creep into the framework of your church brothers and sisters I want to say it this way don't look at this building and call it the church look at that little teeny little spot on the inside of the heart because that's where that Antichrist spirit's going to creep into but if you got the Holy Spirit ain't no Spirit getting in there that's the strong man oh my the bad guy's going to come and try and kick down the door inside that that that spot but he's not going to have any opportunity when their eyes were open they knew him 1964 0212 don't stand and look at it and try to figure it out like the Pharisees said they stood and looked at him there and said this man is beah they had to try and classify him according to their knowledge according to their wisdom the teaching of man's Wisdom right the enticing words of man's Wisdom they had to put a classification on him your Oneness your Tess what what are you where'd you come from where where where'd you get your your ticket from who's your parents right and if they can't do that then automatically you become devilish my this man is be elub they couldn't figure it out they had to give it a name they said this man does this by the spirit of the devil can you imagine that we know that's why he said I'll forgive you now cuz you don't know but let me tell you something when my Holy Spirit comes around when when I give you what I'm going to go through I'm going to have my body split broken spit on punched kicked totally humiliated destroyed so that I can impart my spirit back on you you say one word against my spirit on any one of the little ones and it would be better that a millstone was hung around your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the ocean my this man is be elub they couldn't figure it out they had to give it a name they said this man does this by the spirit of the devil he is a Beelzebub a fortune teller I don't have nothing to do with this fellow can you imagine that don't have nothing to do with this guy he was born in sin he don't have our fellowship cards what does that have to do with being born in sin right many times it's like that though oh my where did he where did he come from that guy came from out in the world he must be a a terrible individual he was wasn't born in the message right don't go there brothers and sisters I got a quote for it but I'm not going to bring it today brother bradam he says it there's something wrong with your experience when you start doing that when we start judging people that way there's something wrong with us well I don't have nothing to do with this fellow he was born in sin he don't have our fellowship cards he doesn't belong to us and oh my they don't even know where he went to school at he has no education why well where did this man come from now he says the son of man that's going to ascend up descended down he was born right here he's crazy unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood he's a cannibal and he did that just to make them say those things can you imagine that that wasn't just a man standing there it wasn't just a third person of the Trinity either it was God he he could discern their thoughts he knew exactly what was going on they had to do it he says and so is the Holy Ghost today putting forth his word in manifestation that men might condemn it I say Lord have mercy that God might put his judgment upon the Earth as he promised he would do now just remember brothers and sisters we we could easily say yeah Lord pour it out man there's some people that are pretty bad but remember brother bradam he said it he said it very clearly the ones who actually were the souls under the altar that were crying how long oh Lord holy and true do you not come and avenge our blood and he says you know what you must rest a little season until your fellow Brethren are killed like you were also and he gives them all a white robe he gives them all eternal life he gives it to them and tells them to just rest for a little season brother Brandon brings it out very clearly and says that those people under the altar were the Jews because the Gentile cries out for Mercy for the Brethren the Jew cries out for vengeance there's a difference we could be saying Lord have mercy bless their hearts we could good but there's something different in in that little teeny space of the heart of a True Believer isn't there we want to see Mercy we want to see grace we want to see eternal life part imparted to the people in this world we recognize we recognize what's going to happen millions and billions of people are going to perish and not just in this world not just laying down their flesh we're not saying that about about some sort of a war or some sort of a uh maybe an event that's going to take place maybe an asteroid's going to hit the earth I'm just throwing stuff out there brothers and sisters I'm not saying it's going to happen but you know if something like that did happen there' be millions and billions of people that would probably lose their lives over time but we're not talking about that in this flesh we're talking about eternity that great white Throne judgment that we've talked about that Daniel saw that John saw where people stood before that Throne all of the great people of this world death hell the grave the sea everyone had to give up the dead that were in them to go and stand before that white Throne of judgment oh my it's it's shocking to think about it's going to happen some people might say well we'll just gamble on it we'll just see brother Barry we don't know nobody has ever gone over there and come back maybe not but I believe a prophet did and I believe he gave us a good report but we can exercise our ability to impart Grace to this world why would we want to push judgment my you hear people say oh Cannon F serpent seed foolish virgin at best who is that that makes that kind of a judgment brothers and sisters I'll say it this way forgive me for saying it someone's probably gonna Scorch me for it but I want to say this brothers and sisters I do believe this it's either the Antichrist Spirit that's going to talk that way or it's God God those are the only ones that are going to speak that way he promised he would do he hardened the heart of pharaoh Hallelujah he is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he is God his systems of doing things shows himself Mighty in his word to manifest it he don't have to tell you all about it you don't have to figure it out you can't figure it out you got to accept it and this is what the Vindicated Prophet said he said just invite him in and see what happens if anybody here today has any doubts I would say just do exactly what he said push aside everything you think you know and just allow him just invite him in all the way and see what happens guarantee you you'll see results the voice of the sign 1964 brother Bram he says and notice when he did one day he began to speak to the people and he said excuse me unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood there is no life what would the doctors say about that now he never explained it I just love that how he never explained it how important is it for us brothers and sisters not to be able to explain every single thing not to be able to understand every single thing if we could do that it wouldn't take Faith then all the theologians would be Leaps and Bounds ahead of most of us right because they could learn their way into heaven and the same thing with the message of the hour if we can know every quote if we can memorize the entire message and all of the the message theology if we understood all of that and memorized it all there would be no faith involved but it's not up to us to understand it it's only up to us to believe it and when we believe it what happens this is what the Paradox is it's very strange but it's true when we simply believe it first then he reveals it to us second then we come to the place where we get the Revelation about what he's talking about we get the Revelation about what it means to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives the perfect realization of who we are except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood there is no life what would the doctor say about that now he never explained it he he never did say any he he just come for so many them that he forew he come he said no man can come except my father draws him and all the father has given me they will understand it they'll come see they'll come they'll understand it the one my father has given me those names is on the book of life he come to redeem them now we know we are talking about the Book of Life studying it in the exposition of the seven Church ages just a tremendous study out of the sardian church age just fantastic and I I believe we're going to preach on that but maybe just a little bit right now even there's one book and a couple different portions of that book and there's people's names that are on that book before the foundation of the world people's names that aren't on that book people's names that are in the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world those names can never be changed in the Book of Life the rest of the volume those names can be added or deleted it's not up to us to do it it's up to us to recognize where our name is and I know I remember a brother really torn up just ripped from end to end because he could not understand how his name that he knew that he knew that he knew that his name was in the Lamb's Book of Life the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world is the way it's written in the Bible we typically refer to it as the Lamb's Book of Life same book as The Book of Life just a different chapter in the same book that same book that John saw in the hand of him that sat upon the throne and we know that John heard the voice that said is there anybody worthy to take that book out of the hand of him that sits on the throne and John what did he do he wept greatly because they searched all of Heaven they searched all of Earth they searched under the Earth they probably went into all of the future they probably went into all of the past they went every single place they could possibly go looking for one worthy but then John saw the lamb Oh my he saw the lamb come and take that book and open it didn't he and that lamb he actually gave the book to John just such a beautiful thing going off topic here but we know that there is a portion of that book with our names written in it and how are we ever going to know that our name is written there brothers and sisters it has to be revealed to us we can't find our name written there he has to reveal it to us but when he does reveal it to us then we come to that place where I believe a brother has said it recently I don't know who said it uh it's simple that when we read the Bible we know brother bradam said that we need to be able to see Jesus Christ in every scripture every verse every line of the Bible every time we read it we should be able to see Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ as we read it and if we can't then we need to go back and read it again keep doing it until we can find it but then I think it goes a little bit further brothers and sisters and I'm by no means trying to correct the prophet the Vindicated prophet in our day but I believe he brought a message that gives us the ability to say I can see my name written in that book I can see my name written in that book when he talks about us oh my I'm I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and how am I one of them it's by Revelation the perfect realization of this word that was given to us in the day in which we live to call me to bring forth my sacred portion my tiny little piece of my heart oh which is the greatest treasure that ever was placed upon on this Earth to give it to the Lord Jesus Christ even though he gave it to me I can just give it back to him and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and you know what happens pregnation happens there comes a point in time where that teeny little spot in the heart of a human being can just no longer contain that little Revelation that's in there oh my and it just starts to live out through the rest of our body doesn't it it changes the way we walk it changes the way we talk it changes the way we think amen talking to a brother recently you know we have thoughts we we have the devil coming around and sprinkling thoughts in our mind about the way a Brother's thinking about us and what we do we take those thoughts and we just put them into captivity and we say no I know that brother's not like that he wouldn't be that way that's not what he's thinking about me that's the devil sometimes we can do that about parents sometimes we can do that about spouses sometimes we can do that about pastors just allow the Lord brothers and sisters to take every single thought in our lives into captivity and we'll see a different result the voice of the sign 1964 brother Adam says watch the word is always corrective the word is always corrective I think it's so beautiful I was reading the scripture this morning just so wonderful I'm I'm going to mess up the the name I think it was Manassa I could be wrong 12-year-old king of Israel and what happened he actually was risen up into that lineage and he became king of Israel and and he absolutely fell off the wagon so to speak and he absolutely went off the deepend and started to serve Idols carved an idol himself and placed it in the temple of God raised up the high places did all of the terrible sins that that that were possible in the land and what did God do God raised up his enemy and he actually took him down into Babylon and said you need to repent you need to correct and then what happened he responded to the correction of the word and God put him back God put him back but you know what happened was it was too late already because his children had been taught the erroneous ways and we know that his son raised up in his stead after he passed away and his son went right into to it right into sin we need to be careful 1964 the voice of the sign watch the word is always corrective Lord help me to surrender myself to the word to the correction of the word that little 12-year-old boy never knew a day in school as we know of just a child he never knowed it he said it perhaps but watch what he said know ye not that I must be about my father's business this is Jesus we're talking talking about here not the 12-year-old I was just referring to by the way for those who might be wondering brother Bram goes on to say and he is the word today he is the same yesterday today and forever I I just think that's the greatest the greatest scripture for me is is just to when I actually began to get the perfect realization of that Hebrews 138 such a familiar scripture brothers and sisters so many times we can just say it and it sounds good and we just gloss over it but if he is the same yesterday in the past today and forever if he doesn't change then all of his attributes are available to the True Believer every single one of his promises is still true today we don't have to look back and think wow was such a great ministry with a prophet I'm I'm I'm guilty I'd been there what would it have been like to stand before the prophet I remember the first time I heard there was a prophet and that he could discern the thoughts in the heart of a man I said I ain't never going to go near that guy cuz I know he's going to know who I am oh my if people knew who I was what I thought what I did blah blah blah I I would be a scoundrel I knew it right and and many people do know it but you know he is the same yesterday today and forever he's still calling he's still calling we have the ability to heed his voice it's such a tremendous thing that scripture is just so powerful and he is the word today he's the same yesterday today and forever know ye not if he had been about Joseph's business his dad Naturally Speaking the one who actually reared him up not the one who actually sired him for the record Joseph his dad who was married to Mary he'd have been making Carpenter business but he was about the father Heavenly father's business now we know what he's referring to here that they were in Jerusalem and and they were there and the whole Company of Mary and Joseph and the whole family and who knows how many people were with them but they left Jerusalem thinking that Jesus was there in the company one of the children running around a 12-year-old probably just on the verge of being a man and and they got three days journey down the road and and thought can you imagine the conversation Mary where's Joseph oh I don't have them I thought you had him no I don't have him where is he and they went back to get him we know the story he was there busting up them organizations they had up there a 12-year-old wow they had up there and all that scrupled it he was tearing it to pieces and they was astonished a little boy like that that knowed that it was God speaking through him because he was the word for that day oh my notice how perfect that is Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his revelation we find out is the same he started healing and when he did everything was fine but then when he began to it it is the voice begins to speak unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man well they the congregation walked away said oh that fellow he's not educated that's why he's doing that that's that's why he's saying those things he he's he's not from the Seminary so of course he'd be following something fanatical right oh that fellow we don't want to hear him no more that fellow is out of his mind they forgot all that he had done the manifestation they didn't read the Bible to see what hour they were living sure he was an odd person God does it that way they say odd things how odd was William brandham if anybody is interested we have uh I'll I'll just show this out there on the computer in the back we actually have the life story and many people probably already have it but if you don't have it it's narrated and it's actually a wonderful thing you can actually take that life story put it on a thumb drive stick it in your car and every time you get in the car you can be listening I'm not saying you should I'm just saying you can you can take it and load it on your computer if if you want the life story we have a digital copy here and you're more than welcome to it but he was definitely odd if you listen to the things that he encountered what his family went through he was definitely an oddball wasn't he that's why he could preach the message Oddball he he knew what it meant to be oddd why couldn't Micaiah agree with the rest of them Israelite prophets down there before Jehoshaphat in them see why couldn't he had the word of the Lord he had to say and he said I'll only say what God Said and we know that he was standing against 400 God prophets brother bradam said and they all said you're gonna win don't worry King Ahab even though your wife is running the kingdom the unbeliever you want to go down and take that Kingdom it's actually your kingdom yeah you should be able to go and get it go for it don't worry but that man josephat hey isn't it wonderful that he said haven't you got one more Prophet amen I I'm sick and tired of hearing this same old thing the good old boys club there's got to be someone else and that one said hey I'm not going to say anything to conform I'm only going to say what God puts in my mouth and what did he say he said hey if you go down there you're ain't coming back and if God is God just try it and see what happens right and they didn't like that but why couldn't he he had the word of the Lord he had to say it he said only say what God Said and they had the scriptural authority to show that they were right it was their land they was the king but not all the scripture Jesus said it is also written see they didn't understand it and it wasn't for them to understand because Jesus is a divine revelation when we actually catch the perfect realization of who Jesus is today not just yesterday and not just in the future we know brother bradam said it many times in his his his his ministry that many times people they'll be busy thinking about what God's done in the past and how tremendous God has poured out blessings in the past and and and what he's going to do in the future but what what's happening right now they're just ignoring we don't want to be of that group we we want to be the one celebrating saying he is Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and and not just for other people for me and my house for me and my church for me and my situation in the voice of the sign brother Bram he says notice the Prophet come and when he does it shows a sign and then there is a voice in that sign that speaks a voice that speaks a scriptural voice that has to be according to the Bible reflecting the word for that hour it's always been that way it's always will be that way because God can cannot change isn't that wonderful to think that we have been given the ability to see that God sent a prophet to the ability to understand what the prophet was sent for there's some people in this world that don't know that yet and I just have such a burden to see those people hear about this voice I know I lived in this city for 33 years and hadn't heard that God sent a prophet nobody ever said that God sent a prophet to me I heard about Prophets I heard about all kinds of musical prophets and different prophets and many different things and I knew the name Prophet we the the devil's not stupid is he he's the most subtle of all the beasts of the field ain't he isn't that his position and what has he done he's taken the word prophet and made such a mockery out of it he's he's tarnished it so terribly for the people that have claimed to have some sort of a prophetic anything that people when they automatically hear the word Prophet they're just disgusted and immediately that was my reaction but I had to go and look it up and recognize that it just means messenger I we know brother bradam says that out of the word it means preacher Prophet don't be scared about the word Prophet there's nothing to be scared of it's God who is rich in Mercy wanting to show his love to mankind but we know that we had a scriptural voice that came in our day a sign of healing healing when people had tremendous problems in their lives mentally physically financially whatever it was if they were genuine with God God was more than willing to actually bless them according to their desire and many times they didn't even have to have a prayer card and get in line God would just discern their heart as they sat there in the audience what a tremendous thing brother bradam says that the voice and the sign that speaks a voice that speaks a scriptural voice that has to be according to the Bible there has to be some rails there has to be some guidelines for it that's where we can say well is that man speaking actually going to be worth listening to or is he another fanatical like the rest of the world like Satan has done with that word how will we ever know we got to be willing to take it back to the word ourselves and see is that true it does the word of God say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is there a scriptural identific a there has to be a scriptural voice and that has to be according to the Bible reflecting the word for that hour what hour is it brothers and sisters this is the hour of body change this isn't the hour of talking about building an arc this isn't the hour about talking about tremendous healing campaigns even though all of that is sort of part of it isn't it it's not a time to be talking about amassing great wealth and and becoming super uber wealthy in this world all of that's going to burn it's going to melt the gold that we amass is an element and it's going to melt with a fervent heat is what the Bible says the only thing of value is that soul that little teeny spot that's inside our heart and in that little teeny spot that's inside our heart have we taken the blood the token and struck the doorpost of that heart it's always been that way it always will be that way because God cannot change now notice jesus' first Ministry oh they all everybody wanted him in their Church oh my he's such a a great fellow sure he went in all the synagogues and read the Scrolls and sat down everybody young Rabbi and we know in our day in our age it was the same way with this Vindicated Prophet they loved his healing campaign they loved the way he talked about the word they loved his ministry oh but once he started to act become a voice behind the sign and start actually expounding upon the word oh my that was when they said NOP too much we can't do it brother BR goes on to say here but one day he began to talk to them Jesus began to talk to them in another way he didn't just continue on there was a change in his ministry the voice of the sign began to speak and we know that that voice of the sign began to speak I and my father are one unless you eat Eat My Flesh and drink my blood ye have no life in you as soon as he did that they wanted to kill him why did they want to kill them because in that little tiny space in their heart there was no faith to mix with the word that was coming across their path so what happened the only thing that was left was what was already in there and what was in there was murder because they were of their father the devil is what the word says oh my but one day he began to talk to them in another way I say Lord speak to us in another way let us actually have the perfect realization the perfect revelation of this word so that we can recognize who we are and the voice of the sign began to speak nobody wanted them one of them said this man is crazy it's a cannibal trying to make a cannibal out of all of us and some people might even say that when you start talking this way my we're not talking about being cannibals some people might say well now you're getting fanatical talking about you and your father being one and and and all this if his spirit's on the inside of you then who are you let this mind that was in Christ be in you also who's are you who is it that's actually thinking and reasoning in your body if it's us we're going to make the wrong decisions all day long every single time we might get one maybe two if we're lucky we'll make some good decisions along the way but the rest of it will be hiccuping along the dusty path of life if we're Sons and Daughters of God it won't be easy but one we actually do surrender all to him it does become easy because his word says it doesn't it my yoke my yoke is easy my burden is light when we start to get burdened down with all of the cares of this life brothers and sisters we can go on our knees and actually cry unto him and say Lord where are you and you know we can even say this brothers and sisters and I know some people might get upset but others are going to say Amen we can say where is the god of Elijah because he's the real God and I say I need him on the scene now and he'll come he'll come we know that Daniel the great Prophet Daniel he prayed and he waited 21 days 21 days for the angel of the Lord to come to his rescue but what did he do get upset did he say oh I you know it's 20 days ago and I haven't heard anything and I'm just going through all this pain and Agony so he must not care nope no no like Abraham 25 years 20 years in people were saying you sir are a freak you're saying you're going to have a baby at 100 years old you're a nuts man we should lock you up we should commit you to the infirmary because your your cuckoo according to the wisdom of man's teaching aren't you right but what did he say he said you know what 20 years down the road I know that promise has never been as close as it is today that promise is closer than it's ever been in my life and I say make ready the nursery oh my make sure we got thread and and yarn so we can knit those blankets so we could be ready for that baby when it comes because it's coming and I just want to say brothers and sister sisters don't get weary in well-doing if we haven't seen a promise answered from God yet don't get weary that promise is closer than it's ever been it's never been so close in our lives to think about the Rapture of the church don't think about the great Eternal event that's going to take place think about right now in my life what is changing in my life I should be seeing a body change God is only interested in our own personal spiritual growth and if we're not growing we're dying we have got to be making sure that we're feeding on the word I think it's so beautiful Matthew 16 my I just feel like I want to start preaching now in Matthew 16 I'll call the musicians as a as a as a token as a promise that uh we're going to end here you know in Matthew 16 the the greatest the greatest words I think that came out of Peter's mouth Jesus was asking them who does the world say that I am and and we know that he said he said to them who who who is everyone what's the word on the street about me they said some Elias and some Jeremiah and some the prophets but he narrowed it down because he wasn't talking to the rest of the world he wanted to see who they thought who do you say that I am amen but he didn't just say who do you say that I am who do you say the son of man is verse 17 of Matthew 16 Jesus J answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah why did he say this to him because thou he said to him Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God remember this is the man who was a fisherman he he mended Nets he didn't go to theology school he didn't go and go to university he wasn't studied he wasn't taught to think critically he never earned the right to this and Jesus Christ God in flesh was very quick to tell him that and to make sure that all of the rest of the people were able to perceive the blessing it moved from fish now to Total realization to Total Revelation such a revelation that the entire Catholic Church would try and build their Church Upon This and Miss what actually took place here Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and we know that that is what the church is built on Revelation not the rock of a Peter not Peter a man so unstable that he would deny Christ and curse while doing it we know that's what brother bradam taught that's not what it was at all it was the realization the perfect realization the Revelation that was given not by flesh and blood not taught in a theology in a seminary not not not because of Any traditional teaching simply because God himself chose to plant those thoughts in his heart amen and I just think brothers and sisters many times we can have those thoughts planted in our hearts but do we actually act on those thoughts I'm going to end there I'll ask you to stand with me as we close are we allowing his thoughts to permeate through our lives 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the Earthly oh my we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption so don't worry about this flesh worry about that Soul get the Lord Jesus Christ inside that soul and allow him the spirit of Truth to lead us and guide us he says behold I show you a mystery which shall not not all sleep but we shall all be changed isn't that interesting all of us will be whether we come from the grave or whether we actually see a molecular change in our bodies how that will happen no man knows except for God himself the one that could eat fish and eat honeycomb and then step through a wall that one the one that could break the bread that we read about that could break the fish create all of those things the same one that could actually come down in our generation and speak a squirrel into existence how do you explain that you can't explain it you just have to believe it we just have to believe it that in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible isn't it beautiful this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortality must put on immortality my I need to stop I I I could just keep going and going God richly bless you today brothers and sisters I pray that we would all be able to come to the the perfect realization of who we are through this word let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this time today Lord where we could gather together in your name we thank you Lord Jesus that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord Jesus that your desire for each and every one of us is that we would be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye father that Lord Jesus we would be able to see this corruption oh Father be changed into incorruption that this mortality father one day would be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye into immortality father Lord I pray that you would help us to search our hearts Lord to find that little tiny space inside of our hearts Lord that so hungry and so thirsty and that Lord we could fill it with the right things that we would not be trying to satisfy our Cravings with the things of this world Amen but that Lord we could just go on our knees and spend time with you in prayer and allow you father to fill that void that we would feed in the right places that we would not feed in the wrong places father I pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways if Lord there's anybody that desires to have the baptism of your Holy Spirit I pray that you would just grant to them right now in the name of Jesus Christ the ability to receive that free gift from you Lord understanding that it's not just a package that we would put in our pocket and take but Lord that it's where you become Lord over their lives and father that every single Sinful Nature has to go when you come into our lives father I pray that Lord if there's anybody here that needs a refilling of your spirit Lord Jesus who has fully committed their lives to you and Lord just needs a little bit more father Lord I pray that you would grant that now in the name of Jesus Christ father that that that light that once burned bright and clear in our hearts father would just Lord Jesus Shine to the world around us father that our lamps would not become cloudy and and and SM but father that we could just trim our lamps Lord while there's still time that you would allow us father while we have the chance to fill our lamps with your oil Lord father we love you and we thank you and we just want to commit each life into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen he's changing
