Ruth in our midst once again it's always a privilege to have you here and we have a special guest speaker tonight but the dawn snow is going to take the service and he's going to give the second half of his testimony which I know full well isn't going to be enough time he's going to need another service somewhere along the way and we'll just trust the Lord for that opportunity but we know that uh where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and if you've come expecting to hear from the Lord tonight don't look at the Veil don't get caught up with a badger skin that Badger Skin's been torn from the top to the bottom like we heard on Sunday let's just sing that song into the chamber this evening as we invite brother dawn to come and just speak to us into the chamber be free Holy Spirit Speak to Me Gently as I close the door ever family lover LED thy presence [Music] thank you all right [Music] now [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Lord that surrender surrender all things unto you

voice you said your sheep know your voice they recognize your voice Lord wherever it may come from Lord that always has to come out of the revealed word of the hour it has to be supported by that it has to be fortified by it Lord father we love you and appreciate you Lord and thy will be done this day Lord Jesus Christ's name amen greet you all in the name of the Lord a little bit of a surprise I guess for some of you was a little bit of a surprise for me I thought it wasn't going to be till March 29th but it's interesting how God does things because for the last two weeks he's been really driving me into the word to for this message and then yesterday the pastor reached out to me of course under the inspiration of a couple Services last few Services I'd go him and like brother I don't think I could wait till the 29th I don't think I can wait just feeling the inspiration from the brothers and the men of Pastor and that here and uh so he called me yesterday and he's like brother you go you tour I'm like I sure can I'm ready and willing so here we are so I hope it's a blessing to you I believe it will be a blessing to you this is not my words my thoughts I pray that that comes across tonight but what we'll do is we can turn first in your Bibles and we'll go to John John 10. if I was having to put a meth a title or something on this really the overall theme it's out of the invisible Union but it's about recognizing election but tonight the first half of the invisible Union it's more of a warning before he gets to the reward that's promised to us and it's about double-mindedness so tonight we're actually going to be talking uh on double-mindedness but there's a blessing on the other side of it if you can overcome it so John 10 anyway verses 27 to 30. my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I am my father are one the next scripture we'll go to is John 13. verse 36. he says Simon Peter said unto him Lord whether goeth thou and Jesus answered him whether I go thou canst not follow me now but Thou shalt follow me afterwards and then the last portion of scripture for now Saint John 14 verse 6. it says Jesus said unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen can take your seat so I don't want to keep you standing so tonight I just want to share with you I call it my testimony but it's just places where God is really strengthened my faith and anchored my soul in such a way that I never ever thought possible coming from a backslidden condition to things that he's done for me but Above All Else he's anchored me in his word last year I started this testimony I gave account of the earlier stages of my walk but I really wanted to get to this portion but this part really concerns about my faith and where it's anchored I'm compelled like I said to talk to you about the invisible Union that he ministered and the things that he showed me in there that I pray it'll be a blessing to you and this isn't about me the man Donald snow it's about the real me the inner me identified and anchored in Christ please don't look at me don't think I have a real complex about me standing up here thinking people are going to think I'm that's not it at all I don't want to be up here I don't want to be recognized for anything I just want you to see him and hear the testimony that I have I no longer Harbor any thoughts of my own concerning this word I check any and all thoughts and ideas by the reveal word of the hour and if the word corrects it I drop it immediately if it proves the idea to be true I embrace it and I let it guide me into further truth the Roman Candle effect that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost today it's the washing by the word I believe we're all in agreement that after the seals opened in 1963 the ministry changed it was more about focus on calling out the bride and a majority of the message became prophetic he was started pointing to a time down the road it became more prophetic the word of that time clearly Vindicated who he was and who he is and the scripture told of a Time according to God's calendar it should have placed him perfectly in scripture according to the calendar of God's word and it pointed to the Future for a few for a further fulfillment plainly the prophet's message produced the great light that is prophesied to return and ripen the word into our hearts the prophet himself was a sign he was the wave chief and through the seventh Angel's message came the perfect revealed word of God we can all agree on that it's a light by which we have our being we move everything our Mortals and objectives everything we do we always check and see if it lines up to the word we're so we're so guaranteed in that word and we're so sold out to it that we always want to find our position in that word this is the perfect word for the perfect washing to produce perfect Faith it's got to come out of this word continually point it to another time when the full understanding would break forth upon the body of Believers and achieve its ultimate goal a time of maturity and harmony it was prophesied to be despite the body having received the open book he said a supernatural element still remained in this uh is this the signs of the end sir in 1962 he said the Mysteries here's the the mystery a mystery is a scripture this previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the revelation he said the greater Mysteries and the great Mysteries are and this is paragraph 244 and he starts listing he listens about 11 of them and there's the serpency there's the kingdom there's uh water baptism there's Christ being the fullness of the godhead baldy he lifts about 11 then he goes on he listens about another 10 but not naming them but he was talking about all of the truths that the seventh messenger was to clear up all the Loose Ends but he's saying despite those being revealed there's still a supernatural element still remained pointing to a time when they would come and be made manifest to a body of believers I'm just going to drop down here he said but the mystery though these Mysteries are divinely revealed as Supernatural elements still remained so simply put he told us that there's a difference in receiving the message and accepting it as truth the knowledge of Jesus Christ versus actually receiving he himself personally the person of the word the light of the world time had to be permitted for the message and the prophecy to mature it had to follow God's pattern Prophet prophecy then there's time permitted and then that prophecy comes to pass some of us might think it was a long time but according to God he actually shortened the days and it's been one of the shortest times that a prophet to Prophet prophecy to manifestation actually has taken place he said he's shortened the days lest no flesh be saved that's how dark the hour that we live in is we went through the childish times like a child wearing our Daddy's boots stumbling around impersonating via legalism then the teenage years of know-it-alls quoting quotes to show maybe we got something that no one else has splitting up the body into groups and clicks and scattering but that's all the will of God he has this every time it scatters the body but then God comes and he promises to heal and bind and restore and I think we can all say we've we can see that that that happened over the last 60 years I know I love how the Holy Spirit presents his mystery truths excuse me every word in the message the titles everything is carefully selected and thoughtful every detail lying within its pages are meaningful from the scriptures that he selects the ones that he mentions or even only references from the songs that are sung same thing we've seen tonight brother Joe I sure appreciate your your prayer brother I was in the back nerve you prayed all my nerves went away right I really appreciate you can see the how the song is the prayer it's it's amazing to see and it just brings such confidence knowing that you're in the will of God when you see things line up like that so even the stories and The Parables he talks about to the thoughts mentioned in the opening and closing prayers and sometimes the detail that seems out of place or insignificant is the very little detail that holds the whole truth back for from you or releases it to you but you can only for you can only fully see those things in the time of its possession continually opening itself you'll read it and you'll get something from it and then you'll get a revelation so and you go back and read it and it just keeps opening up opening up it's by the washing of the word but it's for the perfecting of your faith right he said he was hitting the tops the high places uh the high spots he said he was storing up food and he encouraged us to drill down into them so that's what I'm saying when you're reading a message at least that's how it falls upon me and my heart is to look up when he mentions a scripture to go look it up and sometimes I find it really really helps support the rest of the message you didn't have time to do it but he said he was just hitting the high points and he said drill down into it one of the simplest lessons of the revealed work is attitude and sincerity he said you cannot receive the full purpose and the full fullness of the message if you approach him as a novel or a newspaper and we're all guilty of it there is a blessing in that too sometimes I'm driving in my car and I'll put on the message and just as background music it's okay to do that but there's also a part of your life where you really need to seek God in the message said uh don't read them as a newspaper or diligently seek him within the pages it's an eternal word ever unfolding the letter still kills but the spirit still gives life but it's only to those that are procrastinated to see it truly and holy so as we go into the invisible Union I've Looking Back Now at the title of it after studying it and show seeing what God showed me there's three things in the title that he talks about and it's about the bride of Christ the Union and the invisible part so the bride if we we sometimes we think we know what certain things are but just as looking into them then some knowledge comes out about it says a bride is a is a woman that's just married or about to be married a woman types the church and vice versa that if we break down the word Christ it says the anointed word he's the word in season the illuminated word and then the union part is an act or instance of uniting or joining two or more things into one it's a uniting in marriage it's the growing together of severed Parts it's a unified condition combination or Junction a gracious Union of excellence and strength or something that is made one so when I think of that right away my heart goes to until we all come to the unity of the faith and the unity of the body members together but then also them to him so it's a marriage of the family of God and then we look at invisible it says and something that's invisible is incapable by nature of being seen not perceptible by vision inaccessible to view or hidden not marked by outward signs not openly acknowledged or made known not able to be recognized or identified and then my favorite it's of which of such small size or unobtrusive quality as to be hardly noticed inconspicuous not noticed or acknowledged treated as if invisible overlooked so the Unseen part there's a part there where it'll actually be recognized by some but is saying that it's unrecognized my question is why would it be unrecognized who's it on recognized by what why is it that they can't recognize it and then the thing about that comes to me is like if our gospel be hid it'll hit from them that are lost or laid to see as blind naked and don't know it or as we know the Jews were blinded so the gospel can come to us and now layer to see a blindness so the gospel can be returned back to the Jews these are all the things that I see laying in just the title but that's from after studying a message it's fair to say that the message could be titled and I'm not changing the title of it but just sometimes to hear things in a little different way it's the unrecognized marriage of the bride of Christ or the second coming of Christ in Bride form the invisible Union of the bride of Christ so Christ's coming they're always different than what any believer priests or Scholars thoughts that they will be we know that every time he comes he comes totally different than what our own intellect our own ideas think he would come is first coming when it transitioned from grace to law law to Grace they were singing about his coming we know that the prophet told us young women were praying that they would be the vessel that carried carried them they were quoting the very scriptures and the prophecies about him and yet they completely missed him he's standing in their midst they missed the Fulfillment of the prophecy how the prophet told us that there's a spiritual and carnal believer and he says that a carnal believer he goes he always sees what God has done they look backwards he said they can feel the pull of the hour but they can't fully accept the promise of the hour he goes but their hope mentally partially accept the word but their hope blinds them into missing it the very fulfillment looking for the manifestation down the road so you're either looking back or looking forward and missing what God is doing it says that hope the nature of Hope is in confidence it always looks forward but hope has to manifest into faith so if we I want to start into invisible Union it's a paragraph 23 and this is just where he reads the scriptural texts you can turn there if you want it's Romans 7 1-6 or I could just read it he says no ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which half and husband is bound by the law to her husband so as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law and of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brother and he also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which for by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death and then verse 6 but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter just a few things in this though I mean for me the main thing is verse six uh we'll talk I'll get to the quotes where brother Branham talks about this and the how it's kind of surprising that he chose this text but the big thing here is newness of spirit so newness can be as a compound meaning it's a it's rooted in time and class but it a newness and meaning of time it's the state of being Revel relatively new or recent with the inclination of being appropriately contemporary which is modern or currently just saying it's new in the time uh frame and then the other com meaning of it is in class it's the state of being new and different with the implication of being Superior and then he the next word is uh spirit or mind and the root meaning of that is actually inner being and then it's the non-material psychological which we know as the soul faculty which is potentially sensitive and responsive to God as an expression of the Divine and contrasts to the purely human so he's talking about the oldness of the letter versus the newness of the spirit or change of your mind it's also it talks about the way of thinking it's an attitude or disposition reflecting the way in which a person thinks about or deals with a certain matter in other words disposition attitude point of view frame of mind or way of thinking and then he goes into paragraphs 34 24 to 34 and he just starts talking about the Golden Age he said if God asks them to preach at any age he would choose this age he said it's actually greater than his first coming he then he talks about Dwight Moody when he read Dwight Moody read this and he in Chicago and he ran out in the streets and he's like do you know Grace do you know Grace you're like Grace who he's like Miss Grace so he talks about that he was just finding his footing settling his spirit and then he goes into paragraph 35. he says Paul here is giving an illustration in the scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set an order here that we as a church can no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and to be legal and lawful about it so he's worried about the legal and lawful part of it then it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband and she says I have my own thoughts on that and I believe that the Bible says it's truth and of course he he the Bible says that for a woman divorced her husband he has to be dead that's divorcement there is no other way uh but now he goes but I believe also it is to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy I went back and I looked at him like I don't see it Lord open my eyes I I don't see it but he says it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so now he's getting our attention and really and we'll get he gets into it but I'll just kind of let the cat of the bag now it's actually about double-mindedness but when God turns a corner there's an overlapping of the Aegis and the understanding of one age or when the prophecy comes to pass there's the new understanding Enlightenment further and there's the old and now you're in that overlap period you had to either stick with the old or move forward in the word it's a he actually talks about it as a double-mindedness so he said I looked up prophecy prophecy if you want to just take the just the standard form of it it's prophecy is the inspired declaration Divine will and purpose so he said it's a mystery of Prophecy so here in paragraph 40 he says may I had add to this woman Grace may I place her in the Bible that's called the lady elect Miss Grace and he used the Miss m-i-s-s which he's referring to an on married woman up to the age of 30. he goes that's who I'm going to talk about the Bible declares said that to the lady elect if you notice elect come from the word elected lady one lady amongst all other ladies was elected so he's saying chosen I never truly understood election the way I should but election just simply means selected you were selected by God when before the foundation of the world he knew whether you would receive them and accept them or not and when I read that right away my heart goes back to the sudden secret going away of the price where she had all of her cousins and they thought they were going to get the big Rancher but there was a quality in her that he was looking for then he goes on in paragraph 41 like the Virgin was to bring forth the body of God on the earth she wasn't an elected woman God chose Mary so he's just showing election means chosen and so God has chosen an elected lady which is his bride she's elected I hope we're members of that tonight across the world Across the Nation so this was a part of the series where he was actually hooked up and he was preaching uh Vancouver all across he was very many few places would actually opened their doors to him at this point so he would get on and actually have to do broadcast over the radio to try and get the message out so then he goes on and he goes into 43 and this is where I've read right over the top of this so many times but he says the illustration here showing the relationship of the bride of Christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him The church here is an illustration we've gotten view was illustrated by a woman which a woman is always the type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God but when you first read that he actually mentioned four phenomenal things he said he was going to show the relationship of the Bride to Christ he said he was going to show how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him so there was a time when he was to be brought something happened and then it was going to happen again so this message addresses all four of these questions or points kind of reminds me of the three big questions you know Where'd I come from where what am I doing here where am I going it's the same thing though I'm a student of the message for years I read over the top of points like this but the Holy Spirit lately draws my attention to the smallest of details so now he drops right into paragraph 49 and he says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride to catch that woman elect now we have a prophecy this he says three times he said when when when when when this happens the whole point he said of this is that he's going to reveal the mystery of Prophecy and right when you read the message very seldom is the brother Brown hit the point so hard first and then dropped back so this kind of when I saw it it struck me as odd I'm like wow that seems like the mean of the message why is he doing that so early but what it is he's giving the prophecy and then he's going to show an obstacle you have to overcome to get to the fruit or the reward of it right here he said you'd get a Revival but she has to begin to come back and line herself up with the word so there had to be a falling away there had to be and we're all identified in that you could have been in the message your whole life just came we're all represented represent in this prophecy the prophecy said that we had to come back and line up with the word you might say well I haven't done anything the prophet said we have we can only take it right so there is two parts to it there's a promised Revival but you have to recognize that you're at a step and you have to come back and line yourself up with the word so now he's going to go in and talk more about that I apologize that this format is not too you're used to but this is how the word of the Lord works on me and I'm just getting used to being doing this format so I apologize if I'm not making as much eye contact but maybe as we go on it's in my heart but I just want to make sure I hit the points okay so he promised a Revival a Revival means to revive make a live Quicken but he said this time without sensation he said he'd bring it to life so prophetic it's a this is post-profit and right when I read this my heart goes to the preview of the Bride he had that vision and he's like get back in line and when he wakes up but he's still calling that out in the room get back in line right there's no self-righteousness here there's no white at walls the bride got it a step and we're all represented there remember the Rich Young Ruler the last lesson our Prophet taught us in leadership he said he kept all the letter of the word but he said one thing thou lack us Supernatural element that he promised it was lacking it's true it brings true leadership what it is that he didn't have representation or election even though he kept all the words he still didn't have representation earlier we read that my sheep hear my voice and I know them there's a time when God reaches out and he shows that he knows you but then there's others that'll come Lord have not done this have not done he's like depart from me you workers I don't know you so we want to be sure that he knows us and he will reveal to you it's by election whether or not you're of his there comes a time when the fruit is hanging there before us and when we say we'll know them by their fruit so many times we all know that one no it's more about you knowing yourself all right amen in that same message in leadership I've read it so many times but I didn't get it but then he went to the poor old hillbilly it was a contrast it didn't seem like it was important it just seemed like a little story but it's actually the very context of what he was trying to explain the little hillbilly who never wanted anything to do with organized religion but he wanted to meet God and he wanted to talk to William Branham and when you start to understand and think about all the circumstances of how God sent that Prophet to him they went to a place for three days couldn't find a squirrel place where they're always squirrels why there was a woman on the hill his neighbor had cancer got healed from it it created the he had a desire in his heart and God sent him that prophet and he led them to the Lord this idea of the Revival aligning with the word he reinforces it now in paragraph 54. because now but you notice when the people when they begin to try to line up with the word there comes a fresh message from the word of God right straight to the people and they catch that message and they line up every time there's a guarantee in that brother there's a guarantee every time but notice he didn't say a word came to a prophet the city came straight to the people this time we're talking about a prophecy for the bride for a Revival I've been persuaded by the message of the hour I've embraced my birth weight I'm a prisoner of love I'm a prisoner to election I can't do no other neither can you there's a reason why you do what you do and while you love them the way you do you're either a prisoner of Christ or of antichrist that's where we're at it's the Seal of God or the mark of the beast and he said only one word off separates the two you we can't do that I can't live this word according to that for something in me CAM and you just have to surrender to it the Holy Spirit holds the bride on that Razor's Edge he said in hearing recognizing and acting down the word of God he said it's 100th millionth of a hair that's the fine lie the one word off in that message even though he doesn't clearly come out and say it but the whole point of that message is he's talking about third pool manifestation versus apostasy and that's that Razor's Edge because that's one of the truths of the message it's a call to line up or fall back I said get in Step it's it's get in Harmony When You Look up the word apostasy I look up a lot of words English was never ever my strong suit I come to find that I get a lot of blessing in looking up taking what Webster didn't say but with the understanding of the message right not just taking what they said but just seeing the glory of the Lord in it so he said apostasy is an act of refusing to continue to follow obey or recognize he said it's an abandonment abandonment of a previous loyalty or defection he said there have come a great Falling Away first he's prophesied or said that he would send strong delusion to for all to believe the great lie he said that they were naked blind and don't know it but on the other side of that we have the third pull which is recognition third pull is true leadership it's headship it's Oneness it's deity veiled in flesh it's a great paradox it's Harmony remember pick up your pen and write this harmony is now to exist the perfecting of our faith isn't resting in our ability to keep his word it's laying in his ability to keep his own word in US he never fails it's Grace and election that's true rest and peace my brother that's the shalom I could never live this message can you imagine even the days where I thought that I had a good day brother Brown said I sinned a thousand times it goes beyond this mental intellect but I take it and I accept it because he told us it was so I accepted as truth it's not in our I'm so thankful it's not in my ability to keep this word and it has nothing to do with this flesh it has to do with Gina God election and whether it's there or not so I wrote down a few questions and these were questions I asked myself can you surrender your will to him completely trust and rely on him pure confidence in the Living Word if you can that's the election on display and it's concerning the word when the word of Correction comes forth can you receive it can you take it can you let it move in your being can you line up to it that's what it is we stumble around in the flesh is not giving you if you never would if you're a bride of Christ you would never do anything to try and bring shame against them but you're in this flesh and you stumble around but right away you say Lord forgive me and actually the prophet in ways told us he's like what are you talking about he doesn't even know it's already cast in the sea and we'll get into that in the later part of being justified but you do it because there's a sincere desire in your heart to be right and and to repent but it's already as soon as you do it even if you just think it in your heart that is the third pull you don't even have to speak it this is what you think in your heart foreign the veil to the holiest of holies the soul of the very elect is where God resides I know we always want to talk about the Tabernacle that was a type and a shadow of the true purpose of God it was to live in in his sons and daughters in their heart and he told us that the veil to the holiest of holies is actually self-will that's why we have the diet to ourselves not my will thy be done Lord right Paul said I Die daily you might live right the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a type it was a shadow of the purpose of God so then I married vows you know the husband vows the love and honor his wife and the wife vows to love honor and obey her husband I'm gonna Bear My Soul a little bit here now uh I'm gonna do a confession I must confess that everything I ever thought concerning their word at the hour up until I was truly born again and received Christ's headship which was roughly three years ago I was an heir I had the knowledge of the message the knowledge of him mixed up with Pentecostal ideas old traditions my own private interpretations and those of my parents or my elders and their hopes and my hopes guesses and maybe Souls at best was at least one word off and if a little eleven eleventh the whole lump it can't if you're one word off it doesn't matter that's why the Holy Ghost is here to hold us on that Razor's Edge if we have to be lined up with the word then there has to be something come to line up too if we can't back up what we're saying or doing by the word of the hour stop line up get back in step our thoughts and opinions are worthless and won't stand if anything you'll be a stumbling block to yourself and to those around you excuse me we're not talking about legalism we're talking about the word live out through you but in his grace and because of election and his name's sake he sought me out found me in extended Mercy to me and I accepted it every correction I've take taken with a thankful heart it's glorious to be to be corrected by the word it's true praise and worship that he cares enough for you to correct you and we know that's true love it's pretty easy to let someone just do whatever they want because he doesn't have to make a stand for anything but true love is correction We Are The Most Blessed age that ever lived we're in the Golden Age The Astronaut Age The Eagle age and these are not just the words that this is it's real it's reality it's not just little things that catch people's attention not buzzwords I'll share this with you every Bible question I've asked him with a sincere heart and a pure desire to know him and serve him better he is Faithfully answered he answers my questions in private study and prayer a thought that comes to mine and runs through the entire message and Bible it comes over the pulpit comes through fellowship with those of precious like faith it always comes by the message of the hour from them I encourage you if you have a Bible question something that you've never truly understand if your heart is Right ask him and see if he doesn't answer it's the time for it you just have to diligently seek him in the word it's not just going to magically come into the air you have to put your foot forward it's laying within the message that is the greatest blessing right now having the correct understanding of the word of the hour without it you have iniquity wrong thinking concerning him you can't take this word and handle it with your own thoughts of intellect or emotions it will bear the wrong fruit paragraph 59 to 61 he actually starts talking about the father's genes uh paragraph 61 he says and therefore assures the gene had to be in your father before for your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God foreign because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world right no way around it that's right now we notice then that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world so he's talking about an election right in the beginning was the word the Word was God the words with God then he goes to paragraph 79-92 he's just talking about the woman being in the betting ground right 92 he says no this is committed to her her sacred virtue sacred Womanhood sacred motherhood is to honor her husband so she honors all three but he's building up trying to explain and show about the invisible Union talking about how it has to be birthed right she honors her husband by all three and now he from 93 to 157 he's he's talking about Hollywood and TV and how they've tricked women into not honoring these three virtues and how the church by false teachers and that were tricked away but then he says in 157 the seed of God is operating through you that's the word of God the love of the world can't be in there at the same time it's not the written word the revealed word now he's talking about a Living Word right and that's what it's always been about what came first it was actually it was always meant to be the Living Word let's see scene of John God operating through you that's the manifested Living Word of the Day living Epistles right he reinforces it in paragraph 160 he says and the Revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what is the what is a revelation Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you we could read right over that was a pretty phenomenal statement it's not about recognizing the prophet or anything else but When Faith is revealed to you when you truly see yourself in the word he's talking about and when that happens nothing nothing can shake you know see it's not God said a Prophet this is no longer the safe haven no longer the standard the word has to be revealed to you who are you and when you go to acting on that word of Revelation Faith that's the word of God not written not revealed it's a living word right it's a personal experience personal relationship not wishful thinking or living off of past manifestation it's your positional placement you truly see yourself in the word the faith of the hour is revealed to you because it's who your very self your inner being he warned us and warned us about looking back at past manifestations and looking ahead he said don't do it you always got to believe and understand that he is and look for the I am what we're talking about he's talking about the union the marriage the second coming of Christ and the body of Believers the very purpose of Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolical faith of the fathers he sent the prophet with the perfect word which is his grace to us because of election Because of Who We Are if you've received the message of the hour Christ in Bride form the final manifestation to the Gentiles before returning back to his Jew and his Brethren the final voice to the final age right that doesn't diminish the past manifestation it was to produce this it was the whole purpose that it happened the mature Brian manifestation is the final Vindication of the prophet's prophecy the prophecy has to come to pass the manifestation of the family of God he was the wave Chief the evidence of more to come in the Harvest he was the first fruits first to mature we know that that's what the message teaches but let it get into your heart into your soul it's amazing that he goes from that and he goes right and this is one of my favorite scriptures sir we all have those certain scriptures that just resonate with us but in 161 he says Abel by faith offered by Revelation he says faith offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain he's quoting Hebrews 11 4 faith is a revelation it goes back to Genesis beginning of twins the spiritual and the colonel if we go back and this is what I'm talking about where he said he's hitting the high points and when he referenced something he it's in my heart I go back and I start reading the scriptures there to see what lay there and that's what he actually he asked us to do uh so when I go back and uh I read I started at Hebrews 11 1 and he goes to now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen but the question I ask is now what do you mean now when is now so upon research and the Holy Ghost where now is the appointed time of the father it's always the appointed time of the father in Psalms 105 19 it says until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him until the time of your word so that's the now it's always the now he says faith is the substance things hope for whatever it's you can overlap the mind he goes faith and so or substance and evidence is the exact same thing and hope and not seen are the exact same thing right so we have the uh faith is the substance the evidence it's the the nature of it it's the essence it's the real being it's the proof the reality that's what faith is it's not a hope so it's a it's actually the reality of the word and then hoped and not seen well that's invisible and unrecognized and that's why there's always a showdown between Hope and Faith it brings a showdown hope is always looking with confidence to that which is good and beneficial but it's always looking ahead looking looking that's the nature of Faith but faith pulls on the word and produces the manifestation of what was presented or what was prophesied or it rests on the promise so we have unbelief doubt looks back past fulfillment Faith recognize and declares that he is and hope looks forward to fulfillment at this time hope is our enemy you must push forward into your inheritance claim it and own it and let it Empower you God is searching for faith and when he finds it he Embraces it he fans its Embers increasing the measure unto perfection so now I go on I read on and I come to Hebrews 11 4 he says by faith Abel this is the one that he was talking about a more excellent which is just phenomenal when you think about it but he said he offered which means to present so he presented God a more appropriate or better or more acceptable sacrifice and he obtained a witness so when he obtained the witness he was he was actually sealed it's saying that he was sealed by his his testimony and all he did was but they both we know we heard the pastor talk about they both received the same message but out of that message one by Colonel thought it was the fruit and that religion is still going around in the world today and then we have can you imagine if we were back there which one would you choose here's a man over here with a rock beaten slashing open if you didn't have Revelation you would be like what's that guy doing he's crazy but when you line up with the word of God and take it always there's you seem crazy you do it's a lot of times you're the forebearer you're you're you're receiving something that still hasn't caught on if you want to say there's always those people of the pillar of it they see it first and then they start giving testimony of what they see and go and then it starts catching on to other people and they start seeing the same thing I'm not saying that's me I'm just saying that's the way God does things right so then he the next one I'm just going back this this is the thing about when you go back with the understanding of the message that you're reading and go back and read those scriptures those scriptures will open something up to you based out of that message truth that he's he's revealing right but he says without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh of God must believe that he is so there we're seeing a faith you have to believe that he is and that he's rewarder of them that diligently seek him a lot of times we Overlook that part those that diligently seek him uh but there's a reward for that then Hebrews 11 13 he goes they all died in faith having not received the promises but have seen them far off and were persuaded of them embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims so right there there's actually a recipe of how God reveals himself to individuals the word of God comes first it persuades you that he said brother Brown said it many times faith is a Persuader persuade you to look at this instead of this it's the beginning of faith and then you have to embrace that you have to become one with it you have to line up with it and then you have a confession of what God has revealed to you and based on that confession you go down to uh 11 16 he says now they desire a better country as a Heavenly where if God is not ashamed to be called their God see they had a testimony of that I don't belong here I'm an eternal being I want to go back there and they had the correct just like how do you write said the right thing their testimony was correct so God put a seal on them and said I'm not ashamed to be called their God and we know there's people that he can't put that seal on based on your confession of who you say he is the current manifestation in terms whether or not he's ashamed of you ashamed of you and your testimony or not whether or not you are his whether or not he receives your sacrifice your offering your worship and the mark that you receive it proves whether or not you're in harmony with him you're either sealed in or out by the Holy Ghost that's being born again the new birth you've received your identification the Union so this is my beloved Son my dwelling place here ye him and he said I am my father are one and he always asks who do you say I am can you see what makes you special what makes you do exactly what's pleasing in his sight you were predestinated to be here right now manifesting God in this age just like the Saints in the Bible you recognize your visitation you're born again a new creation called bride you've received your Birthright the eyes of your understanding be enlightened the Rapture and the change of your body the wedding supper the millennial rain Futurama those are all your birthrights rights of birth the only way you can see it as the very elect they have the fulfilled this portion of the word it's the bride word in you Christ the United word of the hour Christ in Bride form so then he goes into 163 and right back there he was he went back to Genesis and talked about Cain and Abel and how one had faith and then he goes into 163 at the end time both trees are coming to the seed and proving themselves here we are right today laodicea and the bride just as clear and pretty as it can be in Scripture and right before your faces you can't serve God and Mammon you can't be a virtuous bible-believing Christian and Associate yourself in the denominational Affair you just can't do it at the same time one has got to be dead and the other one live this is actually a warning I always thought like Mammon it was but riches and stuff like that but actually if you read this carefully brother Branham just said that Mammon is denominational thinking intellectually reasoning with the word because he said laodicea Mammon denominational Affair he said bride serve God Bible believing Christian so Mammon he's calling denominational Affair Mammon denominational affairs he talked about serve and serve as to be controlled by you may not be in a denomination but you could be possessing a denominational Spirit reasoning with the word your own private interpretation early he talked about the newness of spirit and mind versus the old letter of the law I he showed me that some of my thinking wasn't correct to the message I took the message and it was just old things that were handed down that there was either taught in the message but it was old it was actually Pentecostal thoughts mixed with the message he says now let's take this is I'm glad I got to this point he gets he goes on and he's talking about he continues for from 60 164 to 170. he's talking about God versus Mammon denominational thinking and then he gets it it's very odd it almost seems out of place and he says now look take a good look for a moment with your own spiritual Insight at your soul just look around I'm speaking Across the Nation now just look for a few minutes you out there in Branham Tabernacle you and the Tabernacles on the west coast Arizona everywhere just you're at look at yourself for a few minutes you say that message you're preaching brother Branham it's wrong said look at yourself a little bit let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the word you'll agree with the message let Christ the anointed word search your own conscience let them get into you see if that's not right or not and that's just one or two things mentioned when there's hundreds of them when you take I've read over this time and time again but actually this today When I Was preparing and that the Holy Ghost revealed this to me this mind search your minds he's not talking about all your minds he's you have two minds you have an intellectual mind and you have a mind in your heart and he's saying all of this message when you start seeing it's about double-mindedness and here he's talking about up here he said Mammon being intellectual denominational thought versus God the word he was warned he's giving a warning this is the hurdle that we all have have maybe I'm preaching to myself but this is what God showed me and it really helped me if it helps one of you tonight then I'm thankful for that but he's talking about search your minds and this is actually a recipe on how to get Revival in your own life and that's what for me for three years it's been burning is that every time I read the message I'm opening up Lord show me show me Lord I Want to Be Right I want to I want to serve you correctly I want to be in line with you right it's how you line up is how you get back in Step it's the correct formula is you have to get rid of the double-mindedness every kind God turn a corner every time there's always this enemy of double-mindedness taking the word of God and mixing it with a past ages understanding brother Branham said back you know when they were blind it was a glare from another age or they're on their blind guides but you can't look at this word you can get a blessing from this word by an intellectual concept or an intellectual he goes on later this is just laying the foundation but he starts talking about Eve Eve received the intellectual conception of the word and all down through time there's been this threat of double-mindedness not going all the way on not being fully surrendered to God taking it with your own intellect taking it with your emotions and you can't but on the other side of this warning there's a great blessing he goes on and he brings actually uh from 79 to 188 he hits on the growth of the church and he brings it right up to the shuck and this is what Satan is all hell has been against this promise this is what he tries to rob us all of and it's through the Last Enemy is the double-mindedness he says and then the life comes out of that denomination goes into the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grow and to get bigger so we can cover over something the denomination pulls away I know we all are familiar with this quote why we why ain't we got a denomination eight of this they never will be it's the grain it can't go any further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the son to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about yes sir why did he talk about these other things about a double-mindedness or because that's what's going to write he said that she had new no dogmas no denominational Creeds no private maybe you're already there maybe this was just some but the Lord put this on my heart to speak this tonight it's someone's got to hear it see you can be robbed of this and he talks about a reward and I looked up it ripens like what does ripe I think I know what ripen means ripened means fully grown and developed mature having mature knowledge understanding or judgment it's suitable it's appropriate it's fully prepared it's ready he said this is what has to be ripened into your heart he's promising you maturity he's he's promising you phenomenal things he said brought by aging to full flavor of the best state that's what's going to be in your life never seen since the Garden of Eden well I guess we've seen it in Jesus and of course we're married to him I'm not an emotional guy but inside my heart just leaps for Joy when I read that that's what he promised and something in me says Lord give me that give me that I want it and we're receiving it this is not to be fiddling around with the word like it's a toy or something it's God has got a standard this is raising up the standard and when this maturity that happens he goes right into 191. he goes then you'll have no more doubts no more don'ts when you have no doubts you can pray the prayer of faith you can ask what you will this is a visitation that's promised to us but he puts a if it's a big if he goes then you'll have no more doubts if you let the Holy Spirit reveal it to you so if you try and take it with your own interpretation that past understandings a church age understanding it's not going to work he's got to let the Holy Spirit he said like the queen said about David talking about the interpretation of the dream what a promise have you received these are the questions I asked the Holy Ghost puts on my heart Donald Have you ever received this when's it coming a Revival what faith will clearly identify to you who you really are the word isn't that what it's all resting on when she knows her position when she knows what she is that's what lays in that promise right there the ripening it up in your heart it's the reward of getting past the double-mindedness surrendering all I used to have a little voice in the back of my head that constantly told me I'm not a son of God there were certain scriptures that people in my heart would want to believe but there was always that and I would listen to it I can honestly say today that it's been silenced for three years you can't get me that way anymore all my doubts are settled and my faith isn't based on my abilities my emotions or my feelings it's not based on that experience it's built and anchored because God said so that's where the soul takes rests that's where true rest is it's for years and years because of the only way I can reason it is we all of our Lives it's by the sweat of our brows sweat of our brow everything that we achieve in life but when it comes to this word it has nothing to do with the sweat of your brow it's God's on merited favor God's grace to us it's election the musicians want to come it's nine o'clock I don't want to keep you there is this was the beginning of their the part was actually when you really but I just wanted the when the Lord showed me this the double mindedness and that I was guilty of it he said one word off we're not capable of that there has to be if God requires that then there has to be something from God come to us to enable us to line up with the word and take it and to allow that maturity to come into our lives don't play with the word my brother and my sister come too far we've come too far I've been in the message if you want to say 25 years backslidden for about 12 of them Satan beat me down for some it was because of that voice I hadn't met him yet I heard of him heard all about them it's like me if I stood here and I held up a picture of my wife and I swear you think you know her you haven't met her that's the reality of this word you have to meet him any promise you would just have to humble yourself let them reveal to you how low you really are we're all born in sin shape there's not one good thing in US you have to recognize that if you can't recognize that then he can't work with you the song we were saying Break Me Lord he'll Build You Up he'll break you down he'll build you up I'm sorry I'm just so thankful for what God has done for me got me past that double-mindedness and I see it rampant and I'm not judging anyone or anything but when you lived it yourself you can identify it will free you from it you promised he would said you just got to line up with the word and the lining up the word is just casting down all on an understanding and just taking it the way he said it and let him lead you into it let him give you the freedom and the Liberty in it and when he does you'll stand and live like you never did because it's not you living it you no longer unders you never really think you're alone I used to I struggled from the time I was 13 years old up until three years ago with the lust of the Flesh and pornography and for a year I've wrestled and I didn't want anything to do with it and I kept running into the word running into the word for three years I haven't felt to it he burned it out of me that's all I can tell you I didn't do it myself and I'm I'm not saying he's going to do that but everything but the very Thorn In My Flesh the thing that crushed me every day Lord I don't want to do this and go back and repent and sorry Lord sorry I just I felt like such a hypocrite when I lined up with the word he burned it out of me that's all I can tell you amen what song are we want to stand with me Grace Grace [Music] bad words [Music] thank you Lord thank you Lord for your grace father thank you for your love and your mercy Lord give your grace to a slower deck word of Correction father thank you Lord [Music] what's your name [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] praise [Music] the grace that is [Music] let's just close in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we know that we've heard from you Lord we know that you truly are a dissolver of doubts father just like we have heard about the Book of Daniel you you will come into our hearts Lord and demonstrate your grace to us father you will show us who we truly are and how small we really are not to humiliate us oh Father just to extend your grace to us Lord and father we're so thankful if we have the ability tonight to accept your grace the way that you have given it father then we've been given apart and father and we know a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon father we love you tonight and we're so thankful for your goodness to us Lord we pray that you would just watch over brother dawn Lord we know the devil is going to be waiting for him at the doors he's going to try and stomp on him
