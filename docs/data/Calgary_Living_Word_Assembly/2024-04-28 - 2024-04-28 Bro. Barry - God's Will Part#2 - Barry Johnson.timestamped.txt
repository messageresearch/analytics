[1:07:10] chapter
[1:07:15] 3 another very familiar
[1:07:19] one Romans chapter 8
[1:07:29] my second
[1:07:32] Timothy
[1:07:40] 3 verse
[1:07:47] 11 persecutions
[1:07:50] afflictions which came unto me at
[1:07:54] Antioch and and Antioch at laconium at
[1:08:00] Lera what persecutions I
[1:08:03] endured but out of them all the Lord
[1:08:07] delivered
[1:08:08] me yay and all that will live Godly in
[1:08:13] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:08:19] persecution over in Romans chapter 8
[1:08:25] verse
[1:08:32] 28 Romans 8 verse
[1:08:38] 28 and we know that all things work
[1:08:42] together for good to them that love
[1:08:46] God to them who are the called according
[1:08:50] to his purpose
[1:08:52] amen for whom he did for know
[1:08:56] he also did
[1:08:58] predestinate to be
[1:09:00] conformed to the image of his
[1:09:04] son that he might be the first born
[1:09:08] among many
[1:09:10] Brethren
[1:09:12] moreover whom he
[1:09:14] did
[1:09:17] predestinate them he also
[1:09:20] called and whom he
[1:09:22] called them he also Justified
[1:09:25] ified and whom he
[1:09:28] justified
[1:09:30] them he also
[1:09:32] glorified let's just bow one more time
[1:09:36] Heavenly Father Lord many times we can't
[1:09:39] even really understand or comprehend
[1:09:42] this word when we read it so father this
[1:09:45] morning we just ask Lord that you would
[1:09:48] break this word open to us fresh once
[1:09:51] again like a fresh loaf of bread Lord
[1:09:54] Jesus that we could just sit down and
[1:09:58] partake of Lord that we could just savor
[1:10:01] it as we walk with you along the way we
[1:10:05] just ask that you would bless the
[1:10:06] reading of your word now in Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[1:10:11] this morning you may be
[1:10:15] seated certainly happy to be back in the
[1:10:18] house of the Lord welcome all the
[1:10:21] visitors it's funny how some people go
[1:10:24] away and you think the place is going to
[1:10:26] be empty and fewer people but it seems
[1:10:30] the Lord brings more
[1:10:32] people God richly bless you this morning
[1:10:35] once again welcome to all the
[1:10:38] visitors uh just a few announcements
[1:10:40] we've got a prayer meeting coming up
[1:10:41] this Thursday May the 2nd the first
[1:10:44] Thursday of the month May the 26th we'll
[1:10:47] have a communion
[1:10:49] service and on uh the 18th we have a
[1:10:52] men's breakfast coming up at our house
[1:10:55] and uh I trust it'll be a time of
[1:10:57] encouragement by the word just for the
[1:11:00] record this is not a social event it's a
[1:11:03] time to get together and and reflect and
[1:11:06] encourage one another by the word just
[1:11:09] the brothers we all struggle the devil
[1:11:12] is going about as a roaring lion lion
[1:11:16] seeking whom he may devour and every one
[1:11:19] of us have a testimony of how we've
[1:11:20] overcome the things in our lives and
[1:11:24] just like the sisters have been doing
[1:11:25] according to Titus Chapter 2 just like
[1:11:28] the sisters have been doing according to
[1:11:30] Titus Chapter 2 we plan to do the same
[1:11:33] thing according to Titus Chapter 2 if
[1:11:36] you want to turn over there quickly with
[1:11:37] me in your
[1:11:38] Bibles I'll just have a quick discussion
[1:11:41] about this um we could do a lot of
[1:11:44] social events and I think they're great
[1:11:46] they're fun to do we do potlucks and we
[1:11:49] will have social potlucks at our house
[1:11:52] through the course of the warmer months
[1:11:53] but when we get together in in these
[1:11:55] formats as the sisters according to
[1:11:58] Titus Chapter 2 um it's a time of
[1:12:01] encouragement it's about instructing the
[1:12:03] younger how to actually live as an elder
[1:12:07] how to live as a mature Christian and
[1:12:08] unless we teach our children how will
[1:12:11] they know the word of God says to train
[1:12:12] them up in the way they should go and it
[1:12:14] won't depart from them but if we don't
[1:12:16] train them then how will they know and
[1:12:19] many times it's interesting because as
[1:12:21] parents we can tell our children over
[1:12:24] and over and over the same thing and
[1:12:27] they won't listen to us they'll think
[1:12:29] that it's just us saying something to
[1:12:31] them and then one day the children might
[1:12:33] come home and say Mom Dad guess what I
[1:12:35] got this tremendous Revelation somebody
[1:12:37] said something to me that just it's it's
[1:12:39] it's it's Earth shattering it changes my
[1:12:42] perspective on everything and you'll be
[1:12:44] like oh what is it and and they'll say
[1:12:46] the same thing that you've been telling
[1:12:48] them all
[1:12:49] along and you'll have to say what a sage
[1:12:52] individual that is what what what a
[1:12:54] smart person that is God blessed them
[1:12:56] for their willingness to serve the body
[1:13:00] but you know that's the way it works
[1:13:01] that's human nature it's not the fault
[1:13:03] of the parent and it's not the fault of
[1:13:05] the child it's just the way humans are
[1:13:08] sometimes people have the ability to
[1:13:10] connect with other people in a different
[1:13:11] way that we can't right that's why
[1:13:14] there's an instruction for training the
[1:13:16] younger to be like the older amen but if
[1:13:19] you just look at you know verse uh Titus
[1:13:21] Chapter 2 veres 1 to5 I'm not going to
[1:13:24] read all of it you can when you get home
[1:13:26] just for time sake but verse 6 to 8 it
[1:13:30] says young men likewise exhort to be
[1:13:34] sober minded and that's
[1:13:37] urge urge
[1:13:40] self-control verse 7 says in all things
[1:13:42] showing thyself a pattern of Good Works
[1:13:45] in Doctrine showing uncorrupt gravity
[1:13:50] sincerity sound speech that cannot be
[1:13:53] condemned that he that is of the
[1:13:57] contrary part may be ashamed having no
[1:14:00] evil thing to say of
[1:14:02] you this is about training one another
[1:14:06] amen and you know what I'll say this
[1:14:08] maybe I'm in the office of Pastor I'm 52
[1:14:12] years old in July there's Brothers here
[1:14:14] that are older than me and maybe they've
[1:14:17] got experience that I can learn from I
[1:14:19] don't claim to be the absolute Christ is
[1:14:21] the absolute but he uses the body to
[1:14:25] encourage the body healing comes through
[1:14:27] the body is what brother bradam taught
[1:14:30] so that's why we're doing this it's not
[1:14:32] a social event so just in case anybody
[1:14:34] is wondering we're trying to operate
[1:14:36] according to the word of God we want to
[1:14:37] see everyone be encouraged and uh you
[1:14:40] know we struggle and if there's a
[1:14:42] struggle that someone is going through
[1:14:44] if you confess your faults one to
[1:14:45] another and pray for one another then
[1:14:48] what
[1:14:49] happens then you shall be healed amen
[1:14:51] but how can you pray for one another if
[1:14:53] you don't know what your faults are your
[1:14:54] faults aren't necessarily where you
[1:14:57] actually go and you make mistakes or
[1:14:59] maybe you've got a genetic thing in your
[1:15:01] life maybe you just can't overcome
[1:15:03] something in your life but the devil
[1:15:05] wants you to say that you're isolated
[1:15:07] you're the only person in the world
[1:15:09] especially in your church that's ever
[1:15:11] gone through what you're going through
[1:15:12] nobody else has any clue or idea what
[1:15:15] kind of feelings or emotions you're
[1:15:16] feeling or experiencing but that's a lie
[1:15:19] of the devil because we're all human
[1:15:21] beings and there's only three Giants
[1:15:23] that we have to battle
[1:15:25] right we're not going to preach on that
[1:15:27] today I just want to say brothers and
[1:15:29] sisters consider it the the sisters when
[1:15:32] to get together it's a time of
[1:15:33] encouragement according to the word of
[1:15:35] God if we apply the word of God then we
[1:15:38] can't actually give room to the devil
[1:15:40] that's right the more we apply the word
[1:15:42] of God in our lives in our homes in our
[1:15:44] congregation the less room we give to
[1:15:46] the
[1:15:49] devil so we got a men's breakfast coming
[1:15:52] up May the 18th at our house and like I
[1:15:54] said it's not social Gathering we're
[1:15:55] going to get together and we're going to
[1:15:57] break bread we're going to eat but it's
[1:15:58] going to be a time of encouragement Lord
[1:16:01] willing uh we have brother Dale at
[1:16:04] delodon Sunday June the 2nd he's a
[1:16:07] pastor from Nigeria he'll be taking the
[1:16:08] service here on Sunday June the 2nd and
[1:16:11] Wednesday July 17th we have brother Jack
[1:16:14] Duff from Florida coming here we're
[1:16:16] certainly excited to meet up with him
[1:16:18] he's been on a morning Bible study for
[1:16:21] uh probably since covid the last four
[1:16:22] years and uh We've really come to to
[1:16:25] appreciate his ministry so we're excited
[1:16:27] to see him here as well are you happy
[1:16:29] this
[1:16:31] morning we certainly are excited this
[1:16:34] last week has been a a a good week it's
[1:16:37] been a gripping week I think the
[1:16:40] meetings with brother Nester were just
[1:16:43] wonderful wonderful meetings long
[1:16:46] meetings but so packed with nuggets and
[1:16:50] you know I'm just going to continue to
[1:16:51] say this um as we go forward it's just
[1:16:56] seared in me I'm going to remember
[1:16:57] brother netor for this I know brother
[1:17:00] mvin talked to us about it when we were
[1:17:02] actually in uh in in Philippines with
[1:17:05] him uh a year and a half ago and I
[1:17:08] believe this is the word you were
[1:17:09] talking about isn't it brother when we
[1:17:11] were driving that day we were coming
[1:17:12] back from a jungle church that we met
[1:17:14] but ining ganap it's a more perfect
[1:17:17] description of Justified perfect
[1:17:21] justification in naring ganap and you
[1:17:24] know that's the scripture that we read
[1:17:26] this morning he who was that he did
[1:17:28] predestinate them he also called and and
[1:17:30] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:17:34] and naring ganap uh and whom he
[1:17:37] justified he's already glorified amen so
[1:17:41] we're already seated in Heavenly places
[1:17:43] according to the word of God we just
[1:17:45] have to try and see ourselves and one
[1:17:47] another in that place you know out of
[1:17:49] the saman church age I'm just going to
[1:17:51] go back to where we were um
[1:17:56] I guess it was the 14th before brother
[1:17:58] Nestor came so two weeks ago we were
[1:18:00] just taking a look at God's Will and uh
[1:18:03] I just want to do a part two on that
[1:18:05] today and we probably will have to do a
[1:18:07] three on it but uh we'll just see what
[1:18:09] the Lord will do today but out of the
[1:18:11] samian church age brother bradam he
[1:18:13] talks about how you know we have to
[1:18:15] suffer and and there's just no way
[1:18:17] around that there's no way around the
[1:18:20] fact that we have to suffer as human
[1:18:22] beings and especially as believers
[1:18:24] there's there's no way around that we we
[1:18:26] read it in the scripture this morning we
[1:18:28] know that uh in Timothy persecutions
[1:18:31] afflictions which came unto me at
[1:18:33] Antioch and and lolium at Lisa what
[1:18:37] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:18:40] all the Lord delivered me yay and all
[1:18:44] that will live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:18:47] shall suffer
[1:18:49] persecution and you know as I was
[1:18:51] studying this it just it just hit me
[1:18:55] that you know when we talk about
[1:18:57] persecution it's not necessarily
[1:18:59] somebody coming and stepping on our toes
[1:19:01] it's not necessarily someone from a
[1:19:02] different Church saying you don't
[1:19:04] believe the same doctrine that I believe
[1:19:05] so I'm going to persecute you and say
[1:19:08] that I can't fellowship with you we
[1:19:09] can't have the right hand of Fellowship
[1:19:11] it's not about that necessarily either
[1:19:13] it's about the devil coming and getting
[1:19:15] inside of our heads and what what more
[1:19:19] does the devil have what age has the
[1:19:21] devil ever had more of a foothold Inside
[1:19:24] the Minds of human beings than this age
[1:19:26] in which we live in and how he does it
[1:19:29] is through screens through social
[1:19:31] through all of the electronic contact
[1:19:34] that we have we have way less contact
[1:19:36] humanly and way more screen time as
[1:19:40] human beings it's not healthy for us
[1:19:43] myself included I say
[1:19:45] Lord let me have the spanking too I I
[1:19:48] know I need it and and you know if we're
[1:19:51] actually getting chastisement that means
[1:19:53] that we're actually
[1:19:55] children because if he wasn't actually
[1:19:57] chastising us then I think we had ought
[1:20:00] to maybe have some fear in our lives
[1:20:02] according to the word of God but you
[1:20:05] know out of the saman church age brother
[1:20:06] Bram says the cloudy skies and storms of
[1:20:09] life are no signs of God's disapproval
[1:20:13] neither are bright skies and Still
[1:20:14] Waters signs of his love and approval
[1:20:17] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:20:23] Beloved is only only in Jesus Christ is
[1:20:27] only in his word that's the only
[1:20:30] approval that we
[1:20:32] have his love is elective we read it in
[1:20:36] Romans chapter 8 his love is elective
[1:20:39] which he had for us before the
[1:20:41] foundation of the
[1:20:43] world does he love us ah yes but how
[1:20:47] shall we know we shall know because he
[1:20:51] said
[1:20:52] so and we said this last week how did he
[1:20:55] say so he said it through the five-fold
[1:20:58] ministry he said it through the word of
[1:20:59] God but he didn't come down in in a a a
[1:21:03] ball of light and speak to us
[1:21:04] individually and say I love you we've
[1:21:07] heard it through the office and the
[1:21:09] administration that he has put in place
[1:21:11] for us he's told us that he loves us he
[1:21:15] said so and manifested that he did love
[1:21:18] us for he brought us to himself how many
[1:21:22] has been brought to him this morning
[1:21:25] he's brought us to himself and gave us
[1:21:28] of his Spirit placing us as
[1:21:31] sons and how shall I prove my love to
[1:21:35] him by believing what he said first off
[1:21:39] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:21:43] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:21:47] he and his I was going to say Infinite
[1:21:50] Wisdom he in his wisdom allows to come
[1:21:52] to pass
[1:21:54] so when we see suffering when we see
[1:21:57] Trials Come to Us brothers and sisters
[1:21:59] it's not because we're being destroyed
[1:22:01] and you know what it doesn't necessarily
[1:22:03] mean that we're actually in trouble and
[1:22:06] we're being
[1:22:07] punished because you can't judge what's
[1:22:10] going on by the storms of life God's
[1:22:13] love for us has got nothing to do with
[1:22:15] the circumstances that we see around us
[1:22:18] although for the prophet in the office
[1:22:20] of the Prophet sure enough he was able
[1:22:22] to say that he actually stepped over a
[1:22:24] red flag in his life and he didn't
[1:22:27] listen to the word of the Lord and he
[1:22:28] chose to listen to his mother-in-law
[1:22:30] instead and the Lord required a price to
[1:22:33] be paid for that and it wasn't so that
[1:22:35] he would pay a price for his salvation
[1:22:37] what it was so that he could actually
[1:22:40] see a greater understanding of the word
[1:22:43] in his own life God wanted to get his
[1:22:46] attention on him and not on his
[1:22:48] mother-in-law not on Dr best not on any
[1:22:52] other Ministry that was around that he
[1:22:53] had to contend with with he wanted the
[1:22:56] prophet's eyes on him and him alone and
[1:22:58] that was so that he could properly store
[1:23:00] up food for a season and here we are
[1:23:02] partaking of that food it's just
[1:23:05] wonderful but talking about God's will
[1:23:07] and I I'm just going to do a little
[1:23:08] recap and try and maybe do it quickly
[1:23:11] because I really do want to get into uh
[1:23:13] Genesis and the scripture that we were
[1:23:15] talking about last time there's so much
[1:23:17] in there the story of Joseph is just
[1:23:20] phenomenal but you know when I was young
[1:23:22] my dad was teaching me uh while we were
[1:23:25] still in church he said that if there's
[1:23:27] one thing that I could impart to you one
[1:23:29] thing that I could teach you it would be
[1:23:31] to find the will of the Lord for your
[1:23:33] life and so I kind of had that in my
[1:23:36] heart Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:23:39] that I might not sin against thee and I
[1:23:42] just took that and and wondered for
[1:23:44] years because I I grew up in the
[1:23:46] Pentecostal church and and about age 14
[1:23:48] went out into the world and became a man
[1:23:50] and started doing my own thing and till
[1:23:52] age 33 I was was kind of just wandering
[1:23:55] around a muuk and I still had this kind
[1:23:58] of in my heart but didn't really know
[1:23:59] where to go or or what to do or who to
[1:24:01] talk to even about it and was just sort
[1:24:04] of stumbling around the best I could but
[1:24:06] I still had this desire to find maybe
[1:24:09] the will of God but where do you look
[1:24:10] where do you find it how how do you get
[1:24:12] there and I I just secretly wanted to
[1:24:15] find that so you know for just about 15
[1:24:18] 20 years I was wandering around looking
[1:24:21] for it one day I got witnessed to and I
[1:24:23] came to church and suddenly I heard the
[1:24:26] pastor of the church my pastor preaching
[1:24:30] that his will is his
[1:24:32] word his will is his word and and for
[1:24:37] myself I thought wow that's incredible I
[1:24:40] wonder what that means though H how does
[1:24:43] that actually unpack how do you
[1:24:45] rationalize that how does that work in
[1:24:47] the life of a
[1:24:49] Believer so I I actually struggled as
[1:24:53] many people do even as a young Christian
[1:24:55] I struggled and the devil just loves to
[1:24:58] try and have a field day with Believers
[1:25:00] especially young believers we say that
[1:25:02] you have to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:04] Ghost and it's true but you know the
[1:25:05] battle doesn't start even start until
[1:25:08] you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:10] Ghost because that's where God shows his
[1:25:13] will through our lives that's where he
[1:25:15] shows overcoming power in our lives and
[1:25:18] the overcoming that we have to do we
[1:25:20] could say we need to overcome our boss
[1:25:21] and we need to overcome our teacher we
[1:25:23] need to overcome maybe our parents or we
[1:25:25] need to overcome our children but you
[1:25:27] know who we need to overcome we just
[1:25:28] need to look in the mirror that's who we
[1:25:30] need to overcome when we can overcome
[1:25:33] that guy or that sister then we're
[1:25:35] talking about something and the only way
[1:25:37] that happens is by the will of God the
[1:25:40] word in our lives that comes by the
[1:25:43] spirit but I had this pastor who is
[1:25:45] preaching that his will is his word and
[1:25:47] he said it over and over again and I I
[1:25:49] just many times I struggled and I would
[1:25:52] go and talk to him and and and see if I
[1:25:55] could get some reasoning or
[1:25:56] understanding and he would just always
[1:25:58] try and impart that to me that his will
[1:26:00] is his word and I know what he was
[1:26:01] saying to me now but at the time I
[1:26:03] thought can't you give me something else
[1:26:05] something more to to take home with me
[1:26:08] to a a better tool I'm a guy and I I
[1:26:11] like to use tools and maybe you could
[1:26:13] just give me a brand new tool that I
[1:26:15] could put in my tool box and know how to
[1:26:17] actually deal with these situations but
[1:26:20] he said to me no no no you've got to
[1:26:21] find it yourself his his will is his
[1:26:23] word you've got to open that word up and
[1:26:25] you got to find it and the only way
[1:26:27] you're going to be able to find the
[1:26:28] answer is by his Spirit living out
[1:26:30] through you and you know I want to say
[1:26:33] now I I I wish that maybe I would have
[1:26:35] done more for my pastor when I had the
[1:26:38] opportunity because goodness sakes he
[1:26:40] was giving me the greatest gift that I
[1:26:43] could get by saying get that spirit
[1:26:45] inside of you because that's the only
[1:26:47] thing that's going to quick in that word
[1:26:49] and then you're going to know his will
[1:26:54] so I struggled for many years as a young
[1:26:57] Christian and uh we we went through the
[1:26:59] process of time I became a deacon in the
[1:27:01] church and we got married and we we I
[1:27:04] got married first before I did the
[1:27:06] Deacon bit but we we we were just in in
[1:27:09] the midst of life and we went through
[1:27:10] some real hardships and uh things
[1:27:13] happened in our lives that were
[1:27:15] unexpected and I I started to get a
[1:27:17] little maybe dry walking through a
[1:27:19] little bit of a Wilderness as it were
[1:27:22] spiritually speaking and even even to
[1:27:26] the point where I I just wondered if
[1:27:28] this the Devil comes around in our
[1:27:30] hardest times the hardest times when
[1:27:33] it's the worst and then he whispers on
[1:27:36] our shoulder is this
[1:27:37] real because you know the word of God
[1:27:39] says that you know we're not dealing
[1:27:42] with the trials of our jobs and the
[1:27:44] trials of our families and the trials of
[1:27:46] our finances and the although all of
[1:27:49] those are trials it's the trials of our
[1:27:52] faith is what the Devil Comes around and
[1:27:54] tries to get us on so if he can get us
[1:27:57] on our faith then our marriage then our
[1:27:59] church then our boss then our finances
[1:28:03] everything that we're contending with in
[1:28:04] our lives will fail or maybe even
[1:28:07] succeed as a curse it's a totally
[1:28:10] different discussion but what my point
[1:28:12] is with all of this is I struggled I
[1:28:14] really struggled and and I got to the
[1:28:16] place where God wanted me to I was
[1:28:19] thinking maybe I could do something on
[1:28:20] my own there was some understanding I
[1:28:22] had a revelation of the message message
[1:28:24] and you know I I was living a better
[1:28:27] life I knew I wasn't who I used to be I
[1:28:29] knew for sure that I wasn't who I wanted
[1:28:31] to be but I knew I was somewhere in the
[1:28:33] middle and it was probably better but it
[1:28:36] became a really difficult place because
[1:28:38] I knew there was a power of God I knew
[1:28:40] there was a will of God and I was close
[1:28:42] to it but it just wasn't happening in my
[1:28:44] life I wasn't seeing the fruit of it in
[1:28:47] my life and it really started to make me
[1:28:50] upset and irritated because I'm the one
[1:28:53] that had to do the work work so in all
[1:28:55] of that I had a conversation with god
[1:28:57] one time he spoke to me and this was
[1:28:59] just out of the blue I said this last
[1:29:01] time I'm just going to say it maybe for
[1:29:02] the people who weren't here but out of
[1:29:04] the blue I was just driving one day and
[1:29:05] I just had a voice come to me if you've
[1:29:08] ever had it happen you'll know exactly
[1:29:09] what I mean and I know it because I had
[1:29:12] a few different events in my life where
[1:29:14] I heard the same voice speak to me but
[1:29:17] this time he he just said to me in the
[1:29:19] midst of my my anxiety and my maybe my
[1:29:22] fear and and my UPS set and this was
[1:29:25] like probably a three-year process in my
[1:29:28] life that the Lord came and said to me
[1:29:30] so you're looking for an answer on that
[1:29:32] my my will is my word you want to answer
[1:29:34] for that and I said yes indeed I do and
[1:29:36] I just kept driving and I was going to
[1:29:38] work and yes indeed I do yeah if that's
[1:29:40] if that's you Lord I know you'll
[1:29:41] actually speak to me and you'll continue
[1:29:43] and it will be a scriptural answer and
[1:29:45] that's what he said you want a
[1:29:45] scriptural answer I'll give you a
[1:29:46] scriptural answer and I'm like okay I
[1:29:49] think this is the Lord now and he said
[1:29:50] take a look at Joseph's life the story
[1:29:52] of Joseph my my will is my word it's not
[1:29:56] an achievement it's not a destination
[1:29:58] and it's not an action on our part
[1:30:01] there's nothing that you can do to
[1:30:03] activate my will my will is my will and
[1:30:06] it's
[1:30:07] Sovereign and I thought
[1:30:10] goodness okay and he said but you know I
[1:30:14] I know you want a second answer you
[1:30:16] don't just want one scripture you want
[1:30:18] another one and I saides indeed you know
[1:30:20] me Lord and and so he said okay take a
[1:30:22] look at Daniel take a look at Daniel's
[1:30:24] life it's not an achievement it's not a
[1:30:27] destination and it's not an action even
[1:30:30] though every single one of those things
[1:30:33] is it's a
[1:30:35] paradox so for me I was I was like man
[1:30:38] this is interesting I can't wait till I
[1:30:40] can pull over my vehicle to go and read
[1:30:42] the story about Joseph and to go and
[1:30:45] read the story about Daniel and that's
[1:30:47] sort of my inspiration for us here today
[1:30:49] it is truly a paradox because it it it's
[1:30:52] something that's that seems just about
[1:30:55] unreal but it's very true impossible but
[1:30:58] true and you know the the answer that
[1:31:01] really I was looking for is the truth
[1:31:04] for my question about how can your your
[1:31:06] will be your word how does that apply
[1:31:08] for me in my life at first I was
[1:31:10] thinking it was just a real easy answer
[1:31:12] for the pastor to give it it just was
[1:31:15] simple and it is exactly what the
[1:31:16] prophet said we'll get into it but what
[1:31:18] it was was simply this and and it came
[1:31:21] to me through the word it wasn't because
[1:31:22] somebody told me or talked me into it
[1:31:25] and that's why I think it's so powerful
[1:31:27] if the spirit reveals it to an
[1:31:29] individual it becomes your personal
[1:31:32] revelation it's not somebody talking you
[1:31:34] into something it's not a sales call the
[1:31:37] truth of the question came to me very
[1:31:39] clearly that if ye abide in me and my
[1:31:41] what my word abides in you then ask what
[1:31:45] you
[1:31:46] will it doesn't say go to a specific
[1:31:48] place it doesn't say talk to a specific
[1:31:51] person it just says get my word in of
[1:31:54] you and and my word is is me the spirit
[1:31:57] right but if you abide in me the word
[1:32:02] read the word feed on the word
[1:32:03] fellowship with him in prayer listen to
[1:32:05] the message of the hour demonstrate that
[1:32:08] you're abiding in him then he will abide
[1:32:11] in you then we have nothing to fear we
[1:32:14] can ask whatever we need and we'll never
[1:32:16] ask a Miss brothers and sisters just
[1:32:19] like I've said we'll never get out of
[1:32:20] order in the service here if we get
[1:32:22] excited because won't we have a time
[1:32:24] when we get over Yonder I mean really I
[1:32:28] think it's going to take a few years for
[1:32:29] us to get over the We Made It part of
[1:32:33] that
[1:32:34] meeting we made it brother joose way all
[1:32:38] of the struggles all of the trials all
[1:32:40] of the tribulations that we went through
[1:32:42] we made it can you believe it and then
[1:32:46] we'll say where's brother so and so
[1:32:48] where's sister so and so and it will
[1:32:50] just go on and on and on and on and on
[1:32:56] oh
[1:32:57] my but we can talk about it here and
[1:32:59] have a time right
[1:33:01] here you don't have to worry about
[1:33:03] getting out of order don't worry about
[1:33:06] it I think maybe it might be good for us
[1:33:10] to once in a while that's right
[1:33:13] amen brothers and sisters if you get in
[1:33:16] a rut in a road and that rut has been
[1:33:20] traveled in over and over and over what
[1:33:24] happens is that rut gets deeper and
[1:33:27] deeper and deeper and initially you
[1:33:29] could probably steer out of that rut
[1:33:31] because it's not very deep but
[1:33:32] eventually you're going to come to a
[1:33:33] place where that rut will keep you and
[1:33:35] you will be stuck in that rut amen don't
[1:33:38] make it a rut of religion we want to be
[1:33:42] able to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:33:46] truth he said that if you won't worship
[1:33:48] me the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:33:51] unto me sons and Daughters of the most
[1:33:54] high God that know what it means to be
[1:33:57] justified that knows what it means to
[1:34:00] have perfect justification you never did
[1:34:04] it in the first
[1:34:05] place worship just flows I don't care
[1:34:09] who's here I don't care what they're
[1:34:11] thinking I don't care what I've gone
[1:34:13] through because I know what he's brought
[1:34:15] me
[1:34:15] from Hallelujah 1965 one in a million
[1:34:19] brother bradam he says let me give you a
[1:34:21] shocking something see not all that says
[1:34:24] unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the
[1:34:26] one that doeth the will of my
[1:34:29] father his will is his word I want to
[1:34:34] say this his will is his word sure
[1:34:36] enough we can say his will is his word
[1:34:38] brother Barry the the King James version
[1:34:40] of the Bible is as far as I want to go
[1:34:42] we're talking about a brother in water
[1:34:44] baptism and uh this brother with water
[1:34:47] baptism he wants to just take what Jesus
[1:34:50] said go ye into all the world and
[1:34:52] baptize in the name of the father and of
[1:34:54] the son and of the Holy
[1:34:55] Ghost but what part of the Bible is what
[1:34:59] Jesus said is what I want to
[1:35:01] say we got to follow the word if we're
[1:35:05] following the word then that's his will
[1:35:08] his will is his word we can be ever so
[1:35:10] religious have great times shouting
[1:35:13] jumping in these meetings which were I I
[1:35:16] don't want to be critical but I have a
[1:35:18] duty to do to God and that duty is to be
[1:35:22] sincere and SA what he wants me to
[1:35:25] say many people claim Jesus many people
[1:35:29] claim the word of God but not very many
[1:35:31] people are willing to say God sent a
[1:35:33] prophet and I believe
[1:35:34] him because that Prophet is only going
[1:35:38] to point back to the word of God if he's
[1:35:41] a true Prophet that's Vindicated he's
[1:35:43] going to point to the word of
[1:35:46] God many people claim Jesus many people
[1:35:49] claim the blood but they'll say his word
[1:35:51] is for another time he'll say you know
[1:35:55] what wearing slacks women wearing pants
[1:35:58] that's for that's for another time it's
[1:36:00] for another culture but it's Satan's
[1:36:02] trick to put it off into the past to
[1:36:05] another culture or into the future to
[1:36:07] some other time but ignore what's going
[1:36:10] on right now
[1:36:13] today you know Not much bothers Satan we
[1:36:15] said this last time Not much bothers
[1:36:17] Satan about religion remember Satan is
[1:36:19] the most religious he is the most
[1:36:22] religious
[1:36:24] and he is what was he created for he was
[1:36:28] created to worship he had the worship
[1:36:30] program Satan knows all about it he
[1:36:33] knows all about it but you know brothers
[1:36:35] and sisters we we can go beyond all of
[1:36:38] the theory about Satan and all of the
[1:36:40] worry about Satan and how much power
[1:36:42] Satan has maybe he was created co-equal
[1:36:44] with God just get his will his word
[1:36:47] inside of you and then bring it up on
[1:36:49] your lips one time believing it in your
[1:36:51] heart with all of your heart unwavering
[1:36:53] and you will have that devil
[1:36:56] trembling he will be a powerless
[1:36:59] defeated enemy before you he he knows
[1:37:03] full well that if he can just get us
[1:37:06] bluffed think that we're good everything
[1:37:09] is fine in our lives we've got a
[1:37:10] religious cloak we're a part of the
[1:37:12] message of the hour everything is fine
[1:37:14] in our lives you know what happens is he
[1:37:17] knows exactly where we are and he is not
[1:37:19] powerless but boy oh boy when you step
[1:37:22] back behind that word of God he becomes
[1:37:27] powerless he's a defeated being can you
[1:37:30] imagine quarreling with a defeated enemy
[1:37:34] it doesn't make any sense why would we
[1:37:36] do that he's already defeated but
[1:37:39] talking about his will being his word
[1:37:40] Psalms 138 Thy word above all thy
[1:37:44] name I will worship toward thy Holy
[1:37:47] Temple and praise thy name for thy
[1:37:49] loving kindness and for thy Truth for
[1:37:51] thou Hast magnified Thy word above all
[1:37:55] thy name Amen in the day when I cried
[1:37:59] thou answerest me and strengthen me with
[1:38:03] strength in my soul I say Lord help me
[1:38:08] to cry out because if there's ever a
[1:38:10] place we need strength brothers and
[1:38:12] sisters today it's in our
[1:38:14] souls the world is showing us we need
[1:38:17] strength in our bod so we can have good
[1:38:19] life a good strong long life who wants
[1:38:22] to contend living in this
[1:38:25] life we want to get over
[1:38:28] Yonder but you know what if we do pray
[1:38:31] for our food this is another thing that
[1:38:33] my pastor used to teach a lot we could
[1:38:36] go and eat any food and pray for that
[1:38:39] food God will actually impart the
[1:38:42] minerals and nutrients in that food that
[1:38:45] we
[1:38:47] need if we
[1:38:51] believe out of 1960 the queen of of
[1:38:55] Sheba paragraph 93 brother bam said I
[1:38:58] said I can't help how much Goliath is
[1:39:02] God is still God the god of David still
[1:39:05] lives the god of Abraham still lives the
[1:39:07] god of Jacob lives the God that was in
[1:39:11] Christ is living tonight he's raised and
[1:39:14] I know he's real how many here today
[1:39:17] know he's
[1:39:19] real there's something that no matter
[1:39:21] what the difficult is you want to go
[1:39:25] anyhow remember all of the brothers of
[1:39:28] David even the king were afraid of that
[1:39:32] giant down in the valley but this Ruddy
[1:39:35] little fellow what did he do he came and
[1:39:38] said are you guys serious right now I'm
[1:39:41] just a ruddy little kid I came to bring
[1:39:43] you cheese and meat and try and see
[1:39:45] what's going on in the in the midst of
[1:39:47] the battle here and all of you guys are
[1:39:50] afraid of one measy giant down in the
[1:39:52] valley
[1:39:53] he's trespassing we're in our Promised
[1:39:56] Land he's got no
[1:39:58] right isn't there anybody that's going
[1:40:00] to go and fight him and everyone was
[1:40:02] afraid and this Ruddy little guy what'd
[1:40:04] he do he said okay I'll go and the King
[1:40:07] said oh if you're going to go you better
[1:40:08] be careful because you know you're just
[1:40:09] a youth and he's been a warrior since he
[1:40:11] was a youth and he's a big big bad giant
[1:40:14] now you better be careful isn't that
[1:40:16] interesting the king the the leader of
[1:40:19] the army would be discouraging the one
[1:40:21] who has the revelation
[1:40:23] yes the devil's no different today
[1:40:25] brothers and sisters but that Ruddy
[1:40:28] little fellow what did he do he didn't
[1:40:29] cower from that giant he didn't run back
[1:40:32] up the hill he ran down to the battle
[1:40:35] and I believe the True Believer with the
[1:40:37] spirit of God is going to run right to
[1:40:40] the battle we're not going to run away
[1:40:42] from it we're going to draw that much
[1:40:43] closer
[1:40:46] together he
[1:40:47] says no matter what the difficult is you
[1:40:50] want to go anyhow because there's you
[1:40:53] got an objective and if you'll take the
[1:40:56] right motive towards that objective
[1:40:58] remember he was trespassing he was a
[1:41:00] trespasser there was no enemy that could
[1:41:02] stand before the children of Israel in
[1:41:04] their Promised
[1:41:06] Land not one
[1:41:10] enemy you got an objective and if you'll
[1:41:12] take the right motive towards that
[1:41:14] objective you'll get there you got to
[1:41:17] have the right motive towards your
[1:41:19] objective that's the way I always find
[1:41:21] the will of God first
[1:41:24] think if it's the will of God then my
[1:41:28] motive and my objective to it if it's
[1:41:31] the right motive then the objective I
[1:41:35] have now this might sound a little bit
[1:41:37] nebulous and and maybe stretching
[1:41:39] something here maybe I am stretching it
[1:41:42] but I want to say this if you are in a
[1:41:44] position in your life brothers and
[1:41:45] sisters we'll just jump right to the
[1:41:46] punchline now I got lots more to say
[1:41:49] we're not going to end yet but no matter
[1:41:52] where you're at I I want to say this if
[1:41:54] you've got his spirit inside of you
[1:41:55] brothers and sisters you are in his will
[1:41:59] you're completely in his will some
[1:42:00] people will be worried oh my I don't
[1:42:02] want to take a step I don't want to get
[1:42:04] outside of his perfect will oh I could
[1:42:06] be in his permissive will if I just go
[1:42:08] one inch this way or maybe if I don't do
[1:42:11] this that way or the other then I could
[1:42:13] be in a permissive will brothers and
[1:42:15] sisters get right with God you're in his
[1:42:17] perfect will it doesn't matter where you
[1:42:19] are or what you're going through amen
[1:42:24] because if you're in his perfect will
[1:42:26] you'll always subject yourself to his
[1:42:30] word and as long as you're willing to do
[1:42:32] that if you're willing to subject
[1:42:34] yourself to his word it shows you're in
[1:42:36] his will amen
[1:42:39] hallelujah then I want to say this ask
[1:42:41] what you
[1:42:44] will don't be
[1:42:46] afraid you know we've said it many times
[1:42:48] in the past and I believe it applies
[1:42:50] right here we could be so Heavenly
[1:42:51] minded that we're no Earth
[1:42:53] good so super spiritual about everything
[1:42:57] that we're
[1:42:59] encountering does it really matter what
[1:43:02] side of the bread you put the butter on
[1:43:04] when you're eating does it really matter
[1:43:06] how you brush your teeth
[1:43:09] right it doesn't does it and I believe
[1:43:14] the majority of this life is like that
[1:43:16] for God as human beings we live our
[1:43:19] lives and sometimes we can be so
[1:43:22] spiritually minded we're afraid to take
[1:43:24] a step and what it becomes is spiritual
[1:43:29] analysis
[1:43:32] paralysis we're so spiritual we can't
[1:43:34] take a step but remember what did Joshua
[1:43:38] get commissioned with if you're going to
[1:43:40] March into this Promised Land then every
[1:43:42] single place the soul of your foot
[1:43:44] Treads is your
[1:43:47] possession go forwards be strong be
[1:43:50] courageous be very courageous and March
[1:43:54] forwards because this is your promised
[1:43:56] land and as long as you're in this land
[1:43:58] there's no man that will ever be able to
[1:44:00] stand before you we've gone over and
[1:44:01] over and over this but I just want to
[1:44:03] say it today maybe for the visitors
[1:44:04] there ain't no one devil that can stand
[1:44:06] before you all the days of your life
[1:44:07] when you're in your Promised Land the
[1:44:09] promised land for us today is the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost it's not saying that I'm a part of
[1:44:15] the message of the hour that is a
[1:44:18] falsehood you need to get that message
[1:44:21] of the hour inside of you amen once that
[1:44:24] message is inside of you ask what you
[1:44:26] will because what's the message it's
[1:44:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:44:31] and
[1:44:32] forever all the works that he did will
[1:44:35] we do
[1:44:36] also but if you have the right motive
[1:44:39] towards your
[1:44:41] objective then you can have what you
[1:44:43] will whatever you want than you Lord and
[1:44:46] you know having what you want is not
[1:44:49] going out and saying I want a
[1:44:51] Lamborghini you know I think a a brand
[1:44:54] new Huracan is exactly what God's will
[1:44:57] is for my life there's many people that
[1:44:59] do that I need a golf
[1:45:02] stream God told me this morning when I
[1:45:04] was I was getting ready for service that
[1:45:06] I need a golf stream a and you know he
[1:45:09] said that you're going to get it for
[1:45:13] me can you imagine brothers and sisters
[1:45:17] this is real I'm not saying that I God
[1:45:20] said that to me I'm not saying that I'm
[1:45:23] saying not to you but there's Ministry
[1:45:24] out there wolves in sheep's clothing
[1:45:29] saying those words and people believing
[1:45:32] it amen we're not playing that game no
[1:45:37] no no we're not going to ask a Miss
[1:45:39] we'll never ask a Miss if we've got his
[1:45:41] spirit inside of us we'll only ask
[1:45:43] according to his word but that's why I
[1:45:45] say the only thing for us today is to
[1:45:48] get his holy ghost to get his spirit
[1:45:50] inside of us without his spirit then
[1:45:53] we're going to be just like all the
[1:45:54] other religious cranks in this world
[1:45:56] brothers and sisters the differentiation
[1:45:59] here with the message of the hour and
[1:46:01] everyone else is the real baptism of the
[1:46:04] Holy Ghost and the false baptism of the
[1:46:06] Holy Ghost there's an anointing of the
[1:46:08] Holy Ghost but then there's the actual
[1:46:10] indwelling of the justifying Spirit the
[1:46:14] one who actually justifies us you know
[1:46:17] if we have the right attitude the right
[1:46:19] mental attitude towards what towards the
[1:46:21] word of God
[1:46:23] will bring any promise to pass in our
[1:46:27] lives you know out of uh out of
[1:46:31] uh oh my 1 Thessalonians
[1:46:35] 5 verse 14 says now we exhort you
[1:46:38] Brethren warn them that are unruly
[1:46:40] Comfort the feeble-minded support the
[1:46:41] weak be patient toward all men see that
[1:46:45] none render evil for evil unto any man
[1:46:50] but follow that which is good both
[1:46:53] amongst yourselves and to all men
[1:46:55] Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing
[1:46:59] in everything give
[1:47:02] thanks for this is the will of God in
[1:47:06] Christ
[1:47:07] Jesus concerning
[1:47:10] you I believe talking about the word of
[1:47:13] God it is very very important to just
[1:47:16] consider the will of God and and what
[1:47:18] that really means it is his word his
[1:47:20] will is his word verse 19 says quench
[1:47:24] not the spirit despise not prophesyings
[1:47:26] prove all things hold fast to that which
[1:47:29] is good abstain from all appearance of
[1:47:33] evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify
[1:47:35] you holy and I pray God your whole
[1:47:39] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:47:41] blameless unto the
[1:47:44] coming of Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is
[1:47:48] He that calleth you who also will do it
[1:47:52] I just want to to throw that in there
[1:47:53] brothers and sisters I think it's so
[1:47:54] important for us to remember that it's
[1:47:56] not us doing it all that we just read is
[1:47:59] him doing it it's him doing it in our
[1:48:02] lives but only if we're willing to
[1:48:04] surrender to his will which is his
[1:48:07] word
[1:48:09] my so like we said last time What
[1:48:12] attitude do we have today brothers and
[1:48:14] sisters we're going somewhere with all
[1:48:16] of this this is all leading up to if you
[1:48:19] think about the life of Joseph we just
[1:48:21] described the life of Joseph right here
[1:48:23] out of Thessalonians I
[1:48:26] believe um but we'll get into it in a
[1:48:29] little bit I think it's just so so good
[1:48:32] out of First Peter SEC uh 1 Peter 2
[1:48:36] verse
[1:48:37] 13 submit yourselves to every ordinance
[1:48:40] of man for the Lord's sake whether it be
[1:48:42] to the king as supreme or unto Governors
[1:48:45] as unto them that are sent by him for
[1:48:48] the punishment of evildoers and for the
[1:48:51] praise of them that do well for so is
[1:48:54] the will of God that ye with welld doing
[1:48:58] ye may put to silence the ignorance of
[1:49:00] foolish men as free and not using your
[1:49:05] Liberty for a cloak of
[1:49:07] maliciousness saying I'm in the message
[1:49:10] I've I've made it so I can do these
[1:49:12] dirty things on the sides or dirty deals
[1:49:14] or whatever no not using your Liberty
[1:49:18] for a cloak of maliciousness but as the
[1:49:21] Servants of God
[1:49:23] honor all men love the Brotherhood fear
[1:49:27] God honor the king servants I'll say
[1:49:30] this
[1:49:31] employees be subject to your masters
[1:49:34] with all fear and just for the record
[1:49:36] that word servants has nothing to do
[1:49:38] with wives and it has nothing to do with
[1:49:41] children it's
[1:49:42] employees servants be subject to your
[1:49:45] masters with all fear not only to the
[1:49:48] good and gentle but also to the forward
[1:49:51] the ones that are tough to deal with
[1:49:52] with for this is thankworthy if a man
[1:49:55] for conscience toward God endure grief
[1:50:00] suffering
[1:50:01] wrongfully for what is what glory is it
[1:50:04] if when ye be buffeted for your faults
[1:50:06] ye shall take it patiently but if when
[1:50:09] you do well and suffer for it you take
[1:50:11] it patiently this is acceptable with God
[1:50:15] many times we want to say I got rights
[1:50:17] man you can't treat me that
[1:50:19] way what does the word of God say
[1:50:23] wow even when we're
[1:50:25] mistreated as Believers of this message
[1:50:29] of the hour Holy Ghost filled people we
[1:50:31] don't got a lot of wiggle room if we
[1:50:34] have his will his word inside of
[1:50:37] us verse 21 says for even here unto were
[1:50:41] ye called This is the calling that we've
[1:50:43] been called
[1:50:44] to because Christ also suffered for us
[1:50:48] leaving us an example that ye should
[1:50:50] follow his steps
[1:50:53] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:50:56] in his mouth remember we're talking
[1:50:58] about
[1:50:59] Joseph who when he was reviled reviled
[1:51:02] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:51:04] not we know the word is speaking about
[1:51:06] Jesus for the record but I'm just sort
[1:51:07] of trying to draw our attention to
[1:51:09] Joseph I'm not saying this is speaking
[1:51:10] of Joseph specifically this is referring
[1:51:12] to Jesus Christ who did no sin neither
[1:51:15] was guile found in his mouth who when he
[1:51:17] was reviled reviled not again when he
[1:51:20] suffered he threatened not but committed
[1:51:22] himself self to him that judgeth
[1:51:25] righteously if we do that brothers and
[1:51:27] sisters ourselves then we simply Heap
[1:51:31] coals of fire upon those who are
[1:51:33] persecuting us but when we literally go
[1:51:35] to the stove and open the door and dig
[1:51:37] out a nice bucket full of coals and go
[1:51:39] and throw it at our brother or throw it
[1:51:41] at our sister then the word of God is of
[1:51:43] none effect in our lives right then they
[1:51:46] can actually turn around and potentially
[1:51:48] do that to us verse 24 who his own self
[1:51:53] bear our sins in his own body on a tree
[1:51:56] speaking of Jesus God In the Flesh that
[1:51:59] we being dead to sins should live unto
[1:52:03] righteousness by whose Stripes ye were
[1:52:06] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[1:52:10] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[1:52:12] and Bishop of your souls isn't that
[1:52:15] wonderful to think that we all were
[1:52:18] sheep gone astray but there came a time
[1:52:22] where we heard heard the shepherd's
[1:52:23] voice did you ever see that video where
[1:52:26] there's a herd of sheep on the hill it
[1:52:29] was circulating a little while ago and
[1:52:31] there was a group of people at a viewing
[1:52:33] area here and two or three of the people
[1:52:36] they tried calling here sheep here sheep
[1:52:38] sheep sheep and the Sheep just kept
[1:52:40] grazing didn't even Flinch didn't even
[1:52:43] care like not a word didn't matter how
[1:52:45] much they called the Sheep but then the
[1:52:47] shepherd stepped up and he said the
[1:52:50] words that those sheep were used to and
[1:52:52] immediately the Sheep turned and came my
[1:52:56] sheep hear my voice my sheep know my
[1:52:59] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:53:03] follow that's why we have to have his
[1:53:05] Spirit when we're willing to have his
[1:53:06] Spirit then we'll actually hear his
[1:53:09] voice and you know brothers and sisters
[1:53:11] there's no shortcuts to it we read it in
[1:53:12] the saman church age we have to suffer
[1:53:15] that's the life that we've been given
[1:53:17] Jesus came and he suffered how did he
[1:53:19] learn obedience it was through the
[1:53:20] things that he suffered we're going to
[1:53:23] suffer in this world but when we suffer
[1:53:25] we're going to come in line with the
[1:53:26] word of God and when we come in line
[1:53:28] with the word of God then we can
[1:53:29] exercise the power of God not to go and
[1:53:33] persecute but what we've talked about in
[1:53:35] the past this is the most beautiful
[1:53:36] thing I I think it's probably the the
[1:53:39] key to overcoming as a believer in the
[1:53:42] message of the hour in in Christianity
[1:53:44] in general if we have a problem with a
[1:53:47] brother or a sister go to
[1:53:50] prayer go to prayer and pray for that
[1:53:54] brother and sister that God would bless
[1:53:56] that brother and sister pray that God
[1:53:58] would actually uplift that brother and
[1:54:00] sister pray that that Lord would just
[1:54:03] pour out a spiritual Revelation in their
[1:54:05] life pray that the Lord would heal their
[1:54:07] bodies that he would heal their their
[1:54:09] homes and and pour an abundance of
[1:54:11] goodness into their life and what
[1:54:13] happens when you do that brothers and
[1:54:15] sisters is
[1:54:17] 99.9% of the time I would say it all the
[1:54:21] time for the record God he your prayer
[1:54:23] but what happens 99% of the time is that
[1:54:26] person doesn't change you don't
[1:54:28] necessarily see God pour a blessing out
[1:54:29] in their life but what happens is our
[1:54:31] heart
[1:54:32] changes we get up singing and shouting
[1:54:35] the
[1:54:36] Victory and then we can say victory is
[1:54:40] mine not God you need to change that
[1:54:43] person you need to change that guy you
[1:54:45] got to fix that sister she's just got
[1:54:47] such a mouth on her all she does is all
[1:54:50] he does is all these things the more we
[1:54:53] do that the more we cause
[1:54:56] problems but you know what the prophet
[1:54:58] said we talked about this a little while
[1:54:59] ago say something nice about someone if
[1:55:02] you want to talk about someone say
[1:55:03] something nice don't talk dirty don't
[1:55:07] talk bad when you're doing that you're
[1:55:09] just saying here devil here here's a
[1:55:11] mouth here's some lips and a tongue come
[1:55:12] and use them for your glory that's what
[1:55:15] we're doing that might sound really
[1:55:17] crude and rude but it's true we're
[1:55:20] either going to give voice to God or to
[1:55:22] the devil that's what's going to happen
[1:55:24] in our lives there's no shortcuts for
[1:55:27] every one of us we all have to learn
[1:55:29] obedience the same way God's will for
[1:55:30] our lives brothers and sisters is his
[1:55:32] word God's will is his word and and like
[1:55:35] I said you know I had this conversation
[1:55:37] I knew there had to be a scriptural
[1:55:39] answer for the the question in my
[1:55:42] life and I believe God God brought
[1:55:46] it brother Brad I'm talking about the uh
[1:55:50] the story of Joseph
[1:55:53] my
[1:55:54] goodness actually we'll just read the
[1:55:56] scripture here let's turn over to
[1:55:58] Genesis Chapter
[1:56:01] 30 we've still got lots of
[1:56:04] time but it's amazing how slippery that
[1:56:07] last 25 minutes
[1:56:11] is the story of Joseph is just so
[1:56:15] fascinating because when Joseph came on
[1:56:18] the scene we we talked about this last
[1:56:20] time do you have that slide
[1:56:23] brother I sent an
[1:56:28] email we got a
[1:56:31] minute I
[1:56:34] think I hope it came
[1:56:37] through we talked about this last
[1:56:41] week how Joseph came on the
[1:56:47] scene um
[1:56:54] we know that Joseph he he came on the
[1:56:57] scene through Rebecca but we
[1:57:02] have Jacob who was the the brother that
[1:57:05] started out his life pulling a fast one
[1:57:09] and uh his mother helped him with it we
[1:57:12] didn't really talk about that last week
[1:57:13] but um do you have that slide brother it
[1:57:17] didn't come through that's too
[1:57:20] bad there's a line that I wanted to
[1:57:23] show
[1:57:26] um
[1:57:30] anyways Jacob came into the uh the
[1:57:35] scenario and uh he deceived his dad he
[1:57:39] got the blessing he took it from Esau
[1:57:41] and we know that that's the word of God
[1:57:44] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:57:47] just to give a little bit of a quick
[1:57:48] background on that but uh what happened
[1:57:51] was Jacob now was told by his mom you
[1:57:55] better flee because if you don't your
[1:57:57] brother's going to kill you because you
[1:57:58] took the birthright but he wasn't really
[1:58:00] interested in the birthright didn't mean
[1:58:02] much to him he was willing to trade the
[1:58:04] birthright for a a little bit of food
[1:58:06] because his natural circumstances were
[1:58:08] more important to him than the spiritual
[1:58:10] blessing in his life and so what he did
[1:58:14] was he fled and went to his his mother's
[1:58:17] brother's house lean and lean again did
[1:58:21] what Joseph did he pulled a fast one on
[1:58:23] him he worked for him for seven years
[1:58:25] and was promised that he could marry
[1:58:27] Rebecca he met her and she was the most
[1:58:30] beautiful thing that he had ever seen in
[1:58:32] his life and when he actually was come
[1:58:35] time to marry her she was the the not
[1:58:39] the oldest she was the second youngest I
[1:58:41] think the second daughter and uh the
[1:58:44] father pulled a fast one the
[1:58:45] father-in-law and at their marriage
[1:58:47] swapped and gave him Leah instead of
[1:58:50] Rebecca and uh so he actually got pretty
[1:58:53] bitter in the morning we know the story
[1:58:55] um but what happened was there was
[1:58:57] children born from that marriage from uh
[1:59:03] Jacob with Leah and then there was
[1:59:05] children born with Jacob and Rebecca the
[1:59:09] one Rachel I don't know why I'm saying
[1:59:12] that yeah sorry Jacob and Rachel and uh
[1:59:17] the two children that came from Rachel
[1:59:20] were Joseph and Benjamin and the others
[1:59:24] are from the other wives and the wives
[1:59:27] slaves is what the Bible says and and
[1:59:28] helpers however you want to want to word
[1:59:30] that but uh anyways um it's interesting
[1:59:35] because those two children were with the
[1:59:37] wife that Joseph uh sorry that Jacob
[1:59:41] loved the
[1:59:43] most and uh yeah it's just an
[1:59:45] interesting thing we brought that last
[1:59:47] week but out of out of Genesis 30: 23
[1:59:51] and she can received and bear a son and
[1:59:53] said God hath taken away my reproach
[1:59:56] verse 24 and she called his name Joseph
[1:59:59] and said the Lord shall add to me
[2:00:01] another son Jacob was his father Rachel
[2:00:04] his mother and his brother was Benjamin
[2:00:07] Jacob he had four wives sorry it's not
[2:00:11] scripture now and and we know that that
[2:00:13] he was tricked and there was the other
[2:00:16] two maid servants is what the Bible says
[2:00:19] and uh we know that this is where all
[2:00:20] the 12 Patriarchs for the children of
[2:00:22] Israel came from it's a very interesting
[2:00:25] thing Joseph and his brothers but from
[2:00:27] an early age Joseph could not help what
[2:00:30] he actually was and sorry I went back
[2:00:33] too far to Genesis Chapter
[2:00:35] 30 um I didn't really want to get into
[2:00:38] that I wanted to get into
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:43] Joseph Joseph in Genesis chapter
[2:00:46] 37 is where I wanted to go to
[2:00:52] here we have Joseph at about 17 years
[2:00:59] old he was feeding the flock with his
[2:01:04] Brethren I guess I'll just start with
[2:01:06] verse one chapter 37 of Genesis and
[2:01:09] Jacob dwelt in the land where his father
[2:01:11] was a stranger and in the land of Canaan
[2:01:13] these are the generations of Jacob
[2:01:16] Joseph being 17 years old was feeding
[2:01:18] the flock with his Brethren and the lad
[2:01:21] was with the sons of of billah and with
[2:01:23] the sons of zilpa those are the two maid
[2:01:25] servants and his father's wives and
[2:01:28] Joseph brought unto his father their
[2:01:32] evil
[2:01:35] report and and we know we we talked
[2:01:38] about this last week how Israel loved
[2:01:40] Joseph more than all of his children and
[2:01:43] what did he do he gave him the Cod of
[2:01:45] Many Colors and many times this is a a
[2:01:47] story that's like a Sunday School Story
[2:01:50] and uh it's it's a good good story It's
[2:01:52] a Wonderful story but there's a very
[2:01:54] deep meaning to this story it's way more
[2:01:57] than just maybe coloring books and uh
[2:01:59] the colorful jacket but the brothers
[2:02:03] they couldn't stand who he was because
[2:02:05] they saw their dad loved him more and
[2:02:09] that's simply because they he loved
[2:02:12] their mother more and and that's the way
[2:02:14] it worked but the more they saw of this
[2:02:18] one the more they hated him and and it
[2:02:21] goes on to say that they hated him and
[2:02:23] could not speak peaceably unto him in
[2:02:25] verse four and verse 5 Joseph dreamed a
[2:02:28] dream and told it to his Brethren and
[2:02:30] they hated him yet the more verse 7 you
[2:02:32] know he he talks about the sheaves how
[2:02:35] they stood around and made obedience to
[2:02:38] my sheath and they hated him yet the
[2:02:40] more verse 8 says and and verse n you
[2:02:44] know behold the moon the sun moon and 11
[2:02:47] stars made obedience to me and and he
[2:02:49] told it to his father this is verse 10
[2:02:51] and to his brother and I'm just going
[2:02:52] through this really quickly because I
[2:02:54] want to try and get further than we did
[2:02:55] last time and his father rebuked him and
[2:02:57] said unto him what is this dream that
[2:03:00] thou Hast dreamed shall I and thy mother
[2:03:03] and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down
[2:03:06] ourselves to thee to the Earth can you
[2:03:07] imagine the child saying that that's
[2:03:09] what's going to happen as a father
[2:03:11] you're going to say really we're going
[2:03:12] to come and and and worship you you're
[2:03:14] our son you're going to worship us
[2:03:18] that's the way this is going to work but
[2:03:20] it shows his dad observed it in in verse
[2:03:23] 11 and his Brethren envied him didn't
[2:03:25] like it at all but his father observed
[2:03:27] the
[2:03:28] saying and we know the story goes on
[2:03:31] through the process of time in in
[2:03:34] in process of time the Brethren were out
[2:03:37] doing their things with the sheep and
[2:03:40] and dad said to Joseph I think it's time
[2:03:43] you go check on the on the flocks and
[2:03:45] your brethren and see what's going on
[2:03:46] see what kind of evil they're up to we
[2:03:48] know that they're up to no good and we
[2:03:52] know that while he went out looking for
[2:03:54] them he met a guy in the field and told
[2:03:55] them where they were where the brothers
[2:03:58] were in verse 19 says and they said one
[2:04:03] to another behold this dreamer cometh
[2:04:06] here he comes now what's going to
[2:04:09] happen and let us slay him and cast him
[2:04:12] into some pit where we will say some
[2:04:14] evil Beast hath devoured him and we
[2:04:18] shall see what will become of his dreams
[2:04:22] can you imagine that that's the Brethren
[2:04:25] that he had from the different wives the
[2:04:29] different mothers and and it's just
[2:04:32] terrible how that would be the case and
[2:04:35] Reuben heard of it this is verse 12 and
[2:04:37] he delivered him out of their hands and
[2:04:39] said let us not kill him and Reuben said
[2:04:41] unto them shed no blood but cast him
[2:04:44] into this pit that is in the wilderness
[2:04:46] and lay no hand upon him that he might
[2:04:49] that he might rid him out of their hand
[2:04:51] to deliver them him to his father again
[2:04:53] his intention was to actually save his
[2:04:56] life wasn't it right he wanted to
[2:04:58] actually see him go back to his dad
[2:05:01] verse 23 and it came to pass when Joseph
[2:05:03] was come unto his Brethren that they
[2:05:06] stripped Joseph of his coat his coat of
[2:05:09] many colors that was on him and we know
[2:05:12] that they were absolutely jealous over
[2:05:14] him we that the father would love him
[2:05:17] the way that they he
[2:05:19] did and uh so they they threw him down
[2:05:23] the the they sold him into slavery and
[2:05:25] then I want to pick up the story where
[2:05:27] he actually goes down into into Egypt
[2:05:30] because I think is where it's where it
[2:05:32] really starts to to pick
[2:05:34] up just a little side note along the way
[2:05:38] to look at one one member there's two
[2:05:41] actually in the story Judah and Reuben
[2:05:43] they both play pivotal roles in the
[2:05:46] story but Judah he he was not really a
[2:05:50] kind brother and uh it's interesting
[2:05:52] because if you look at the way he
[2:05:54] treated him and his behavior in this
[2:05:56] story I'm not going to dig too far into
[2:05:59] it but just for the sake of time I just
[2:06:00] wanted to mention it um how his behavior
[2:06:04] was but yet he is the direct lineage of
[2:06:07] Christ we know that Christ came from the
[2:06:10] tribe of
[2:06:12] Judah but it's no accident that it
[2:06:14] behaved that way you know par or uh
[2:06:18] chapter 38 of Genesis he goes into
[2:06:21] talking about Judah and how he had sons
[2:06:24] and how he had a daughter and how the
[2:06:26] son died and and he you know the the law
[2:06:29] of the Jews was that the next son would
[2:06:31] rise up and actually have children in
[2:06:34] place of his brother that passed away
[2:06:35] and the brother was wicked and he didn't
[2:06:37] want to do it you know the story of uh
[2:06:40] of uh Judah here and
[2:06:44] Tamar what happened was he found himself
[2:06:47] down the road going to do a little bit
[2:06:48] of work and as Judah the the one of the
[2:06:51] Patriarchs was along the way what does
[2:06:53] he do he goes and actually doesn't
[2:06:56] doesn't perform the duty that he's
[2:06:58] supposed to he told his do his son's
[2:07:01] wife to go and wait as as a widow in the
[2:07:05] in the house of your father wait wait
[2:07:07] there and when the youngest son gets of
[2:07:09] age he'll actually come and marry you
[2:07:10] and raise up seed in in place of your
[2:07:13] the the two other brothers she said okay
[2:07:15] she was obedient and what happened was
[2:07:17] the other boy grew up and he didn't do
[2:07:19] anything about it he just went along his
[2:07:22] way and as he was on the way going to
[2:07:24] Shear his sheep seeing what was going on
[2:07:25] just conducting business what did he do
[2:07:28] he found a prostitute he thought on the
[2:07:29] side of the road and didn't realize that
[2:07:31] it was actually his
[2:07:33] daughter-in-law and she actually
[2:07:35] redeemed the seed from that tribe
[2:07:38] through her the lineage of Christ came
[2:07:41] can you imagine that that's the way it
[2:07:43] happened just a sidebar about that but
[2:07:47] going down into chapter 39 if you want
[2:07:51] to turn there chapter 39 of Genesis and
[2:07:56] Joseph was brought down to Egypt already
[2:07:59] sold into slavery he was brought down
[2:08:02] into Egypt and potier an officer of
[2:08:05] pharaoh captain of the guard and
[2:08:07] Egyptian brought him bought him of the
[2:08:10] hands of the ishmaelites which had
[2:08:13] brought him down tither so now I i' I've
[2:08:17] laid sort of the background and talked a
[2:08:19] little bit about the backstory I'm sorry
[2:08:20] that it was kind of broken up and I
[2:08:24] misquoted Rebecca for Rachel but here we
[2:08:27] are I'm getting to the point that I
[2:08:29] wanted to get to today and now the time
[2:08:32] is slipping away verse two and the Lord
[2:08:36] was with
[2:08:38] Joseph he was hated by his brothers
[2:08:41] questioned by his
[2:08:43] parents attempted to be killed by his
[2:08:46] brothers sold into slavery by his
[2:08:49] brothers finds him himself through all
[2:08:53] of these bumpy patches all of these
[2:08:55] valleys all along the way did the Lord
[2:08:58] just suddenly meet him there in Egypt do
[2:09:00] you
[2:09:02] think the Lord was with Joseph and he
[2:09:06] was a prosperous
[2:09:09] man and he was in the house of his
[2:09:11] master the
[2:09:13] Egyptian and his master saw
[2:09:16] what his master saw that the Lord was
[2:09:20] with him this is where I want to dig in
[2:09:23] brothers and sisters when we live our
[2:09:25] lives do our masters in this world see
[2:09:28] that the Lord is with
[2:09:30] us because if he sees that he's with us
[2:09:34] then we're going to prosper amen this is
[2:09:37] where I think it's so important to say
[2:09:39] it's not all about a destination to say
[2:09:42] that God's will is for me to move to so
[2:09:44] and so even though it is but even if if
[2:09:47] if if all it is is God's will for
[2:09:50] someone to move from another country to
[2:09:52] come to Calgary to come to Canada in
[2:09:54] Calgary in Canada if that's all it is
[2:09:57] then then what's the purpose there has
[2:09:59] to be more when you're there right
[2:10:02] that's my point we live our lives until
[2:10:04] we can't live anymore so while we're
[2:10:06] living Our Lives we have got to be able
[2:10:09] to demonstrate the life of Jesus Christ
[2:10:11] through US amen we've got to be able to
[2:10:14] show the world that the Lord is with us
[2:10:16] just like he was with Joseph am now I'm
[2:10:19] not saying that we're Joseph but I want
[2:10:21] want to say this the Vindicated Prophet
[2:10:23] for our day Malachi 45 and 6 Revelations
[2:10:28] 10 1-7 that prophet he said that you are
[2:10:32] Messiah
[2:10:33] ET and I know there's preachers out
[2:10:35] there that would say oh that's
[2:10:36] blasphemous that's heresy how could you
[2:10:38] say that if you have his Spirit then
[2:10:41] whose Spirit do you have we know that
[2:10:44] we've heard it preached through a
[2:10:46] Vindicated Prophet that if you've got
[2:10:48] the spirit of Dillinger inside of you
[2:10:49] then what are you going to do
[2:10:51] you're going to be a gangster right if
[2:10:53] you've got the spirit of Beethoven
[2:10:55] inside of you what are you going to do
[2:10:58] you're going to sit down and you're
[2:10:59] going to be able to compose music and
[2:11:02] play but if you got the spirit of Christ
[2:11:05] inside of you right what's going to
[2:11:09] happen who are
[2:11:12] you verse three and his master saw that
[2:11:15] the Lord was with him and that the Lord
[2:11:19] made all that he did to Pro prosper in
[2:11:22] his hand I I just feel so impressed to
[2:11:25] say this brothers and sisters if you
[2:11:26] believe the word of God if you believe
[2:11:28] the message of the hour if you've got
[2:11:29] the holy ghost in your life this is not
[2:11:31] exclusive to Joseph because he was a
[2:11:33] type of Jesus Christ this is exclusive
[2:11:35] to the people who have Jesus Christ
[2:11:37] Living in
[2:11:39] them the world can't claim this but the
[2:11:43] people who have the spirit of Christ
[2:11:44] Living out through them they can claim
[2:11:47] this the Lord will make everything
[2:11:49] prosper in your hand
[2:11:53] amen it's not to say that we're not
[2:11:55] going to go through
[2:11:56] valleys it's the trials of our faith
[2:11:59] that are going to prove who we are we're
[2:12:01] having a conversation this week and I
[2:12:03] think it's so good I'm going to continue
[2:12:04] to say brothers and sisters all you've
[2:12:06] got to do the Lord allows this on
[2:12:07] purpose he allows the pressure to come
[2:12:10] in our lives to squish us don't look for
[2:12:14] some great ecclesiastical squeeze out
[2:12:16] there somewhere look for it right here
[2:12:19] because this is the squeeze that I think
[2:12:21] think is the most important this is just
[2:12:22] my opinion here but that squeeze is
[2:12:24] going to demonstrate who's on the inside
[2:12:28] CU you're either going to have the
[2:12:29] spirit of Christ or you're going to have
[2:12:31] the spirit of the world to reject the
[2:12:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost is to
[2:12:37] what accept the mark of the beast you're
[2:12:40] going to have one or the other Spirit
[2:12:42] living out through
[2:12:44] you I think it's so beautiful we don't
[2:12:46] have to be afraid don't worry brothers
[2:12:48] and sisters just get the baptism of the
[2:12:50] Holy Ghost that's the reason the
[2:12:51] Vindicated Prophet came so that we could
[2:12:53] be introduced to the
[2:12:55] bridegroom and become his Earthly
[2:12:58] bride verse four and Joseph found Grace
[2:13:02] in his
[2:13:03] sight and he served
[2:13:07] him and he made him overseer of his
[2:13:10] house and all that he had put into his
[2:13:13] hand and it came to pass from the time
[2:13:17] that he had made him Overseer in his
[2:13:20] house and over all that he had the Lord
[2:13:25] blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's
[2:13:29] sake how many times have we heard that
[2:13:32] someone is a Joseph to ACC company
[2:13:35] talking about the brothers or the
[2:13:37] sisters they go and they work for
[2:13:38] someone and they just Prosper that place
[2:13:42] things just happen and it's supernatural
[2:13:45] you could even talk to some brothers
[2:13:46] that say I don't even know how it
[2:13:48] happened I can't even explain it I just
[2:13:49] know it did I was there and I just
[2:13:53] prayed the Lord will bless the Egyptians
[2:13:55] house for your
[2:13:58] sake but in this story he blessed it for
[2:14:00] Joseph's sake and all the blessing of
[2:14:02] the Lord was upon all that he had in the
[2:14:05] house and in the
[2:14:08] field and I just think this next verse
[2:14:10] is beautiful and he left all that he had
[2:14:12] in Joseph's
[2:14:14] hand and he knew not ought he had save
[2:14:19] the bread which he did eat
[2:14:22] that means he completely trusted him
[2:14:25] 100% and didn't worry about it and you
[2:14:27] know I believe that's the way God wants
[2:14:29] to be with his child with his son and
[2:14:32] with his daughter with his Earthly bride
[2:14:35] he wants to just say you've got the
[2:14:37] checkbook honey and all you've got to do
[2:14:39] is write the check right and we know
[2:14:41] brother bradam he said that there's two
[2:14:43] types of people isn't there there's the
[2:14:45] fundamentalists where they've got all
[2:14:47] the Dynamics and then there's the other
[2:14:49] ones maybe who are the real Believers
[2:14:52] but they've got the full checkbook but
[2:14:54] they just don't have the money in the
[2:14:55] bank and I'm totally saying it wrong but
[2:14:57] brother bradam said if you ever get
[2:14:59] those two people together the one that
[2:15:00] has the checkbook and the one that has
[2:15:01] the bank account you get those two
[2:15:04] together the Dynamics and the mechanics
[2:15:07] look
[2:15:09] out but here we
[2:15:13] have Joseph as an example living his
[2:15:17] life and it didn't seem to matter where
[2:15:19] he went did it
[2:15:22] wherever he went the blessing of God was
[2:15:24] with
[2:15:25] him some might say well that's just
[2:15:27] predestination God made him that way and
[2:15:29] you know that wasn't for anyone else it
[2:15:31] was just for him and you know sometimes
[2:15:33] that's the way it is that you can't get
[2:15:35] anybody to believe something they don't
[2:15:36] want to believe it takes God to issue
[2:15:39] Revelation it needs to become real to
[2:15:41] the individual but once that happens
[2:15:43] once we recognize that there's a
[2:15:45] compound meaning and Revelation for
[2:15:47] every single verse then we begin to see
[2:15:49] not only Christ from Genesis to
[2:15:52] Revelation but we start to see our name
[2:15:55] from Genesis to revelation we start to
[2:15:57] see that's me that's me that's me hey
[2:16:00] mama that's me that's me I can recognize
[2:16:03] the reflection in that mirror that's me
[2:16:05] it's not just Joseph it's not just
[2:16:07] someone else but you know I I just want
[2:16:09] to go a little bit further here in this
[2:16:12] scripture and it came to pass after
[2:16:14] these things verse S that his master's
[2:16:16] Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph hm
[2:16:21] and she said lie with me but
[2:16:24] what he
[2:16:26] refused why because he was in God's will
[2:16:30] why because his word was in him why
[2:16:34] because his parents trained him up in
[2:16:36] the way that he should
[2:16:39] go so when he was posed with this
[2:16:43] circumstance he didn't cave in he
[2:16:47] refused but you know what the word of
[2:16:49] God says just like the lives that we
[2:16:52] live brothers and sisters it doesn't
[2:16:53] matter what our circumstance what we
[2:16:54] find our station to be what our Giants
[2:16:57] are in the valley because we've all got
[2:17:00] them the devil doesn't give
[2:17:02] up and this woman here even after he
[2:17:07] refused she became persistent and she
[2:17:11] tried more and more and more and what
[2:17:15] did he say in verse 9 he says there's
[2:17:17] none greater in this house than I
[2:17:19] neither hath he kept back anything from
[2:17:21] me this is Joseph speaking to the wife
[2:17:24] about his master
[2:17:26] pontier he hath kept sorry there is none
[2:17:30] greater in this house than I neither
[2:17:31] hath he kept anything from me but thee
[2:17:36] because Thou Art his wife and how can I
[2:17:39] do this great wickedness and it's
[2:17:41] interesting because I I found when I was
[2:17:43] reading this I was expecting the word to
[2:17:45] say how can I keep from doing this
[2:17:48] wickedness against him but he doesn't
[2:17:50] doesn't say that does he no he says how
[2:17:53] can I then how can I do this great
[2:17:55] wickedness and sin against
[2:17:59] God automatically going against the word
[2:18:03] because he knew his
[2:18:05] will and it came to pass as she spake to
[2:18:08] Joseph day by day that he hearkened not
[2:18:12] unto her to lie with her or to be with
[2:18:15] her and we know the story it came to
[2:18:18] pass about this time Joseph went into to
[2:18:20] the house to do his business and there
[2:18:23] was none of the men of the house there
[2:18:26] within and she caught him by His Garment
[2:18:28] saying lie with me and he left his
[2:18:31] garment in her hand and
[2:18:34] fled he didn't give in he
[2:18:37] fought because he knew his position he
[2:18:41] knew his master he knew where he
[2:18:44] stood wasn't interested in just giving
[2:18:48] in and we know the story it goes on to
[2:18:51] say now he's right back into a valley
[2:18:54] again before he was on the Mountaintop
[2:18:56] all that pontier had was in his hands
[2:19:00] but now
[2:19:02] uhoh prison back in the pit back in the
[2:19:06] pit you go he must have been wondering H
[2:19:08] I thought I was in God's will I thought
[2:19:09] his will was his word and his word was
[2:19:11] in me and I could ask whatever I
[2:19:14] will did it
[2:19:16] change no God began to Magnify Him more
[2:19:20] because he condu conducted himself with
[2:19:22] grace even in the turmoil the turmoil
[2:19:26] the situation verse verse 20 says and
[2:19:28] Joseph's Master took him and put him
[2:19:30] into prison a place where the king's
[2:19:32] prisoners were
[2:19:34] bound and remember this is God's
[2:19:37] will back to prison hey verse 21 but the
[2:19:42] Lord was what he was with
[2:19:45] Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him
[2:19:48] favor in the sight of The Keeper of the
[2:19:50] prison
[2:19:51] it's not about where we go brothers and
[2:19:53] sisters it's about who we go with it's
[2:19:57] all about who we go with no matter where
[2:20:00] we go no matter what we do what job we
[2:20:03] apply for what position we're looking at
[2:20:07] whoever we're going to marry whatever it
[2:20:09] is we're doing do it with
[2:20:14] Christ verse 23 The Keeper of the prison
[2:20:17] looked not to anything that was under
[2:20:18] his hand because the Lord was with with
[2:20:20] him and and that which he did the Lord
[2:20:24] made it to prosper am and that's one of
[2:20:27] the biggest tricks of the devil today is
[2:20:29] for us to begin prospering and saying my
[2:20:33] I did good
[2:20:35] today you know what you only did good
[2:20:37] because he allowed
[2:20:39] it and if we're willing to say Thank You
[2:20:42] Lord because you're the only reason I've
[2:20:44] done good he's going to continue
[2:20:46] prospering you
[2:20:52] and we know the story how it goes just
[2:20:54] so good this whole story of Joseph I
[2:20:56] know we're out of time now
[2:21:00] my just a couple more minutes if that's
[2:21:03] okay on we'll carry on later but my my
[2:21:09] my my we might need a part three even
[2:21:12] for Joseph here it's just incredible
[2:21:14] isn't it verse chapter 40 how how he
[2:21:17] goes and now that he's in prison what
[2:21:19] happens is he finds himself with the
[2:21:21] Butler and the and the baker the two and
[2:21:24] they have dreams and and it's
[2:21:27] interesting because as they have dreams
[2:21:30] what does Joseph say to them do not
[2:21:32] interpretations belong to God
[2:21:35] immediately he gives it to God he
[2:21:38] doesn't say oh I can interpret dreams
[2:21:41] yeah God's really entrusted me with a
[2:21:44] gift no he doesn't do that at all he
[2:21:47] gives it to God I'll call the musicians
[2:21:50] or or I will really just keep going on
[2:21:52] and on I don't want to keep us long here
[2:21:55] but you know we we know this story here
[2:21:57] the Butler and the baker he he they both
[2:22:00] inter tell him the dreams and uh he
[2:22:03] tells the butler you know what the dream
[2:22:05] says that in three days time you're
[2:22:07] going to be back you're going to squeeze
[2:22:08] the grapes in Pharaoh's cup again you're
[2:22:10] going to be right where you were but the
[2:22:13] baker he had the three baskets on his
[2:22:15] head and and the birds came and ate all
[2:22:18] of the food the meat out of the basket
[2:22:19] out of the top basket and and Joseph had
[2:22:22] to tell him you know what that that
[2:22:24] means that in 3 days from now you're
[2:22:25] going to hang High the Pharaoh is not
[2:22:29] going to have any more use for you
[2:22:30] whatever you've done you've done and we
[2:22:32] know both of those came to pass and
[2:22:34] Joseph he said in verse 14 of Genesis
[2:22:37] chapter 40 but think on me when it shall
[2:22:40] be well with thee to the Butler and show
[2:22:43] kindness I pray thee unto me and make
[2:22:46] mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me
[2:22:49] out of this
[2:22:51] house and you know in Genesis chapter 41
[2:22:55] this is why I I'm sorry brothers and
[2:22:57] sisters I just I feel like I could keep
[2:22:59] going Genesis chapter 41 I'm going to
[2:23:01] leave off here or I won't quit maybe
[2:23:03] stand with me and it came to pass at the
[2:23:05] end of two full
[2:23:09] years he's in
[2:23:11] prison it's not just a week it's not
[2:23:14] just a month two more full years of
[2:23:18] being in God's will
[2:23:22] if you're struggling brothers and
[2:23:23] sisters if there's a trial if there's a
[2:23:25] a turmoil if there's a situation doesn't
[2:23:27] mean you're outside of God's
[2:23:29] will just make sure you've got God
[2:23:31] inside of you have the Holy Ghost Inside
[2:23:34] of You brothers and sisters it doesn't
[2:23:35] matter what your station is he's looking
[2:23:37] to see your response to the
[2:23:40] circumstance because when you get
[2:23:43] squeezed whatever's on the inside is
[2:23:45] going to come out and when you're
[2:23:46] getting a a a a squeeze spiritually or
[2:23:50] or mentally what's going to happen is
[2:23:53] whoever's on the inside is going to come
[2:23:55] out and you can't hide that person just
[2:23:57] get someone a little bit angry and see
[2:23:59] what happens see how they act do they
[2:24:02] act like Joseph do they have the spirit
[2:24:04] of Christ or do they get really mad and
[2:24:07] they want to lash out they want to call
[2:24:09] you a name back because they feel like
[2:24:11] you stepped on them do they want to do
[2:24:13] this because of that is it this and that
[2:24:17] or is it Lord have mercy am
[2:24:21] because the spirit of Christ is very
[2:24:23] clearly outlined in the word of God I'm
[2:24:26] going to keep going with this Lord
[2:24:28] willing just remember his will is his
[2:24:31] word and just make sure you've got him
[2:24:33] wherever you're at whatever it is you're
[2:24:35] going through commit it to him but he
[2:24:37] wants us to March brothers and sisters
[2:24:39] we've got to be willing to March
[2:24:41] forward we can't just stay in one spot
[2:24:44] we've got to be able to take a step and
[2:24:46] know by faith he's going to have that
[2:24:48] next stare there for us
[2:24:50] many times we can't see it we just have
[2:24:53] to believe it let's just bow in
[2:24:56] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love you
[2:24:59] and we thank you so
[2:25:01] much for your goodness and your mercy to
[2:25:04] us Lord thank you for the story of

[2:25:16] about today and father I pray that Lord
[2:25:19] you would just help us us to maybe not
[2:25:21] stumble around next time so much and
[2:25:23] just be able to be a little more clear
[2:25:25] with it Lord father I pray that you
[2:25:27] would just help us to see the story of
[2:25:29] Joseph and how Lord Jesus you express
[2:25:32] yourself to us and through us and many
[2:25:35] times through us is how you express to
[2:25:39] us father I pray that you would just
[2:25:42] keep your hand upon each one of us as we
[2:25:43] go our separate ways Lord that you would
[2:25:45] be with those who are
[2:25:47] traveling and that father we could just

[2:25:53] clearer as the days go by Lord father we
[2:25:56] pray that you would just be glorified
