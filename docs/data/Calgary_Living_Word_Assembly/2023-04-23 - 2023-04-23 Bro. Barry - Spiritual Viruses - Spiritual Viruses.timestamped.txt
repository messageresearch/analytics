[58:48] way and we thank you for doing that in
[58:50] the name of Jesus Christ oh Father it's
[58:52] not right for a 14 year old child to
[58:55] have to contend with that and we know
[58:57] there was a story in the Bible father
[58:58] that you allowed to be there for our
[59:01] benefit Lord so that we could recognize

[59:06] ways and our thoughts are not your
[59:08] thoughts oh but father if we could just
[59:10] surrender to your ways and your thoughts

[59:47] keep her in our prayers Lord and we just

[1:00:29] all of our children all of our babies

[1:01:36] while Jesus was with his disciples they
[1:01:39] brought young children to him that he
[1:01:41] should touch them and his disciples
[1:01:43] rebuked those that brought them
[1:01:45] but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:01:47] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:01:49] little children to come unto me and
[1:01:51] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[1:01:54] of God verily I say unto you whosoever
[1:01:56] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[1:02:00] a little child he shall not enter
[1:02:02] therein
[1:02:04] and he took them up in his arms

[1:07:40] God bless you this morning let's just
[1:07:42] bow one more time
[1:07:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:07:45] word
[1:07:46] thank you Lord Jesus that there is
[1:07:49] truly going to be a people on Earth that
[1:07:53] have the ability to hear
[1:07:55] and it's not a skill that can be taught
[1:07:57] it's not something that can be learned
[1:07:59] it's truly a revelation from you Lord
[1:08:02] it's the bread from heaven and father we
[1:08:05] just ask now one more time that you
[1:08:07] would sovereignly Reign that bread from
[1:08:10] Heaven father that you would break it
[1:08:12] open to us fresh once again Lord Jesus
[1:08:14] because we know that you've given us
[1:08:16] ears to hear help us Lord Jesus to just
[1:08:19] be quickened by this word father we pray
[1:08:22] that you would Quicken it to our very
[1:08:23] Souls Lord Jesus that it would just
[1:08:26] emanate from our very beings Lord Jesus
[1:08:29] as we carry on our lives father we might
[1:08:31] feel completely the same but Lord we
[1:08:34] pray that your spirit would just pour
[1:08:36] out of us that it would shine out of us
[1:08:38] to the world around us Lord
[1:08:40] we just love you and we thank you we ask
[1:08:42] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[1:08:44] name we pray amen God bless you this
[1:08:47] morning you may be seated
[1:08:51] oh cool
[1:08:57] certainly thankful to be together once
[1:09:00] again
[1:09:01] just one little uh
[1:09:03] comment
[1:09:05] I wanted to mention
[1:09:07] if I could just remind everyone I don't
[1:09:09] really do a lot of housekeeping items
[1:09:12] but this is one that I think is
[1:09:14] important for all of us if we could
[1:09:16] remember when we come to the house of
[1:09:17] the Lord just to turn our cell phones
[1:09:19] off
[1:09:20] they can be a major distraction for
[1:09:22] people around us they could be a major
[1:09:24] distraction for us they could be a major
[1:09:26] distraction for the minister
[1:09:28] we know that the holy spirit is timid
[1:09:30] and we just don't want to bring any of
[1:09:33] the world into this environment we want
[1:09:35] to allow the Lord to be able to move in
[1:09:37] our midst so if you could please just
[1:09:39] remember turn your phone to silent if
[1:09:41] you want to bring it in that's fine
[1:09:44] um but if you can remember please just
[1:09:47] turn it off
[1:09:48] so we don't have distractions
[1:09:51] are you happy this morning
[1:09:52] I keep trying to have a drink here
[1:09:57] I had a
[1:10:00] uh maybe a late night or an early
[1:10:02] morning
[1:10:03] and uh just was wonderful
[1:10:07] time with the Lord
[1:10:09] and I just got into this scripture here
[1:10:11] and I think it's just just a wonderful
[1:10:13] thing you know verily verily I say unto
[1:10:15] you he that heareth my word and
[1:10:18] believeth on him that sent me half
[1:10:19] everlasting life
[1:10:21] shall not come into the condemnation but
[1:10:24] has passed from Death unto life
[1:10:26] as a Believer when we can say that we
[1:10:28] truly have received the word for our day
[1:10:31] we have received the token in our lives
[1:10:34] we've been given the gift of the Holy
[1:10:36] Spirit then we know that we have the
[1:10:39] ability to hear the word and when we can
[1:10:41] hear the word what the word says here is
[1:10:44] that we've already passed from Death
[1:10:46] unto life
[1:10:47] there is no condemnation to those who
[1:10:49] believe
[1:10:50] and when we can sing We can sing with
[1:10:54] freedom we can sing with Liberty because
[1:10:56] we know where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:10:58] there is Liberty
[1:10:59] and you know I just I'm really getting
[1:11:01] into the the discussion of
[1:11:04] um worship and I think it's going to be
[1:11:07] a tremendous series of of services to to
[1:11:11] think about what it's like when we
[1:11:12] worship now and what's it going to be
[1:11:14] like when we worship over there and what
[1:11:16] was it like when they worshiped in Jesus
[1:11:19] day
[1:11:19] what was it like to actually be raised
[1:11:23] from the dead how did Lazarus worship
[1:11:24] how did you know some of the people in
[1:11:27] the Bible worship and uh I think that
[1:11:30] worship is just it's it's the very
[1:11:33] essence of a Christian's life of a
[1:11:36] Believer we we worship but we worship in
[1:11:39] spirit and in truth and unless we're
[1:11:40] worshiping in spirit and in truth then
[1:11:43] we're not worshiping at all God
[1:11:45] many people will be worshiping but they
[1:11:47] won't realize they'll be worshiping
[1:11:49] Satan they'll be worshiping the God of
[1:11:51] this evil age and we know that no other
[1:11:53] age has had a God no other age has had a
[1:11:57] God that has been evil every single age
[1:12:01] has had the word of God but there's only
[1:12:03] one age brother Bradham said the last
[1:12:05] age the final age where Satan has been
[1:12:07] declared the god of the age the God of
[1:12:10] this evil age and that's the age we live
[1:12:12] in I certainly appreciated the service
[1:12:14] on Wednesday where brother Gilbert he
[1:12:17] brought how what what does Luke 17 30
[1:12:20] mean to us what really does that mean to
[1:12:23] us is it just a buzzword to the message
[1:12:25] of the hour that we are used to Luke 17
[1:12:28] 30 Malachi four five and six Revelations
[1:12:31] 10 7 10 10 1-7
[1:12:35] I I just was studying it this morning
[1:12:37] and and I went back to it again and you
[1:12:39] know Lord willing we could potentially
[1:12:40] turn there maybe we should just turn
[1:12:42] there Revelations 10 verse 7.
[1:12:45] and maybe just said a little bit of a
[1:12:47] background for what what we're talking
[1:12:49] about today I just think it's so
[1:12:51] incredibly important for us to never
[1:12:54] overlook this Revelations 10 1-7 we know
[1:12:58] that scripture so so very well
[1:13:02] Revelations 10 1 to 7 and 7 being the
[1:13:05] sort of the Hallmark of the message of
[1:13:07] the hour but in the days of the voice of
[1:13:09] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:13:11] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:13:13] finished when he should begin to sound
[1:13:15] he began to sound back in the 50s back
[1:13:17] in the 40s the mystery of God has
[1:13:20] finished brothers and sisters if
[1:13:21] someone's still talking about a mystery
[1:13:23] then they've missed it
[1:13:25] it's happened the appearing has already
[1:13:28] taken place now we're looking for the
[1:13:30] word coming of the Lord and that's going
[1:13:32] to be in The Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:13:33] know that and when she gets so close to
[1:13:36] him she will become one brother Branham
[1:13:39] says that she will have his very virtues
[1:13:43] she will have his very essence she will
[1:13:46] have himself
[1:13:48] she will be he and isn't that such a
[1:13:52] familiar narrative these days with all
[1:13:55] of the males that have changed and now
[1:13:58] they're legally females wanting to go on
[1:14:01] different sporting groups and Olympic
[1:14:03] things and all this stuff why are they
[1:14:06] doing that brothers and sisters it's
[1:14:07] because it's the anointing of the age
[1:14:09] that is all of creation groaning for the
[1:14:11] manifestation of who us
[1:14:15] they don't realize it and people will
[1:14:17] say well brother bravery you're crazy
[1:14:18] you're going to say the whole world is
[1:14:20] actually being being driven by us yes
[1:14:23] Grace is on Earth right now and she is
[1:14:26] compressing the darkness because
[1:14:28] Darkness flees from light and if you
[1:14:30] have the spirit of Christ in you this
[1:14:31] morning then you are pushing back the
[1:14:33] darkness of this world you're pushing
[1:14:35] back Luke 17 30 as it was in the days of
[1:14:38] lot so shall it be at the coming of the
[1:14:41] son of man Ministry we heard it loud and
[1:14:43] clear on Wednesday we heard it back in
[1:14:44] the Easter meetings the son of man
[1:14:46] Ministry has a little tiny space of time
[1:14:48] in between the Son of God Ministry and
[1:14:51] the son of David ministry right now
[1:14:53] we're in that little midst of time that
[1:14:55] little time is called the son of man
[1:14:57] Ministry that's where God himself comes
[1:15:00] down and manifests in human flesh we've
[1:15:02] read the quotes over and over again I'm
[1:15:04] not going to get into it that way today
[1:15:06] today I've got a totally different topic
[1:15:08] but here we are brothers and sisters in
[1:15:10] the midst of it as it was in the days of
[1:15:12] Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:15:14] the son of man what was it in the days
[1:15:15] of Sodom
[1:15:17] they were into same-sex marriage
[1:15:20] so much so that they wanted to invite
[1:15:22] the Angels who they saw as men they
[1:15:25] weren't interested in in normal
[1:15:28] relations we know that lot said to them
[1:15:31] you know leave them and you know come on
[1:15:33] don't be rude just take my daughters
[1:15:35] they've been married
[1:15:38] but they're virgins
[1:15:41] just go ahead and take them and do what
[1:15:42] you want with them how can that be
[1:15:45] how can that be
[1:15:48] how twisted or perverted was it in that
[1:15:52] day
[1:15:54] you know brothers and sisters I can't
[1:15:56] help but think that there's no greater
[1:15:57] perversion maybe I shouldn't say it but
[1:15:59] I feel it
[1:16:00] then a man that would want to actually
[1:16:03] change his sex to become a woman and a
[1:16:06] woman that would want to change her sex
[1:16:07] to become a man and then the two would
[1:16:09] think they could come together and wed
[1:16:11] in holy matrimony that is the epitome of
[1:16:14] perversion according to the word of God
[1:16:18] we love
[1:16:20] The Sinner
[1:16:21] but we hate to sin
[1:16:25] you know brothers and sisters I'm a
[1:16:27] sinner saved by grace
[1:16:30] I've been given the ability to hear the
[1:16:32] word for my day and I received it gladly
[1:16:36] and everyone else that does it they're a
[1:16:38] sinner but they're saved by grace
[1:16:42] you don't have to remain that way and
[1:16:44] you know we don't look down at people
[1:16:45] and say
[1:16:47] Scoundrels they're behaving this way
[1:16:49] they're cannon fodder and they're just
[1:16:52] lost and you know what they're they're
[1:16:55] they're they're not even foolish virgin
[1:16:57] they're just terrible people you know
[1:16:59] what it's not even our choice to have
[1:17:01] ears to hear the word for our day if we
[1:17:03] have years to hear the word Friday it's
[1:17:04] because God chose you before the
[1:17:06] foundation of the world to be there to
[1:17:08] hear it
[1:17:09] brothers and sisters we've got reason to
[1:17:11] make noise and to rejoice and to say
[1:17:14] thank you Lord for what you've done for
[1:17:16] me thank you Lord for saving my soul
[1:17:18] that was dangling over Hell by a chain
[1:17:22] with a very weak link of humanity oh my
[1:17:26] but one day you gave me the ability to
[1:17:29] hear oh you sent a prophet and that
[1:17:31] Prophet said that you never even did it
[1:17:33] in the first place
[1:17:35] brothers and sisters we've got reason to
[1:17:38] rejoice
[1:17:40] in this scripture Revelations 10 1-7 is
[1:17:43] fulfilled it's happened it's history
[1:17:45] that that mystery is history brother
[1:17:48] Bradham even says it that way the
[1:17:49] mystery is history now we have verse 8
[1:17:52] to 11 and the voice which I heard
[1:17:56] how did he hear it how'd John hear that
[1:17:58] voice he was called to hear that voice
[1:18:00] The Voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:18:03] spake unto me again and said go take
[1:18:05] that little book which is open in the
[1:18:08] hand of the Angel it's not partially
[1:18:09] closed it's not just six seals
[1:18:11] that's a doctrine of a devil if I ever
[1:18:13] heard it all seven seals are open the
[1:18:17] word of God says that open book take
[1:18:19] that open book and eat it up
[1:18:21] if Revelations 10 1-7 is already
[1:18:23] fulfilled then we're already into verse
[1:18:25] 8.
[1:18:28] go take that little book which is open
[1:18:30] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:18:31] upon the sea and upon the Earth and and
[1:18:33] he was obedient and this is a type of
[1:18:35] the Bride John the type of the bride and
[1:18:38] I went to the angel
[1:18:40] the angel and said unto him give me the
[1:18:43] little book
[1:18:44] that's why I just I don't have to pause
[1:18:46] here maybe I'm I'm so sorry
[1:18:48] why did we stop printing books why did
[1:18:51] some people stop printing books what
[1:18:53] what
[1:18:54] we need to be giving out little books
[1:18:56] brothers and sisters right that's the
[1:18:58] scripture right here and I went to the
[1:19:00] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:19:02] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:19:03] and eat it up take that book and eat it
[1:19:06] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:19:08] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:19:10] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:19:13] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:19:14] wasn't my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:19:16] soon as I had eaten it it made my belly
[1:19:18] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:19:20] prophesy again before many peoples
[1:19:22] Nations
[1:19:24] and tongues and kings
[1:19:26] and here we are brothers and sisters
[1:19:28] we've been given a commission we've got
[1:19:30] to be willing to take this book and eat
[1:19:32] it up and not just stand and and quote
[1:19:35] we've talked about this we've got to be
[1:19:37] able to show we've got to be able to
[1:19:40] tell we've also got to be able to prove
[1:19:42] and that proving comes from the life
[1:19:45] that we live
[1:19:46] the life in which we display to the
[1:19:48] people we love and the life that we
[1:19:50] display to the people that we fellowship
[1:19:52] with the life that we display to the
[1:19:53] people we work with that we go to school
[1:19:55] with the life that we live
[1:19:57] you know brother Bradham his life we all
[1:20:00] believe brother Bradham was the prophet
[1:20:01] sent to this age brother Bradham it said
[1:20:03] very clearly that you couldn't tell his
[1:20:05] friends from his enemies can we tell our
[1:20:07] friends from our enemies I say Lord help
[1:20:09] me there's people that I don't really
[1:20:10] want to see there's people that I know
[1:20:11] that have treated me really badly in
[1:20:13] life that I just feel really awkward and
[1:20:15] uncomfortable around and if I can avoid
[1:20:16] it I try to I'm just being honest but
[1:20:20] that's not the right Spirit that's not
[1:20:21] the right attitude especially if it
[1:20:23] comes to Believers there's not going to
[1:20:24] be your department of heaven and my
[1:20:26] department of Heaven we're going to be
[1:20:28] one body in one mind and one Accord and
[1:20:31] then the Rapture is gonna go brothers
[1:20:32] and sisters we're not going to get to
[1:20:34] that place after the Rapture
[1:20:37] it's going to be before the Rapture the
[1:20:40] only way we're going to get there is to
[1:20:41] take this book and eat it
[1:20:43] and we'll become it and when we become
[1:20:45] this book we become him we don't just
[1:20:48] become this book it's not just an
[1:20:49] intangible thing we don't just eat the
[1:20:50] Bible we don't just eat books some
[1:20:52] people do that they eat weird things I
[1:20:54] don't even know what you call it it's a
[1:20:55] sickness I know it's a devil but people
[1:20:57] will take paper and peel it and eat it
[1:20:59] people will eat different things in this
[1:21:01] world but we're not going to do it
[1:21:03] literally we're going to do it
[1:21:04] spiritually but it's interesting because
[1:21:06] it's a it's a literal spiritual thing
[1:21:08] we're literally spiritually consuming
[1:21:12] this book and as we eat this book we
[1:21:14] become this book what a tremendous thing
[1:21:16] it is
[1:21:18] but the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:21:20] spake unto me again I believe we could
[1:21:23] just say that all day long Lord let that
[1:21:26] little voice that I heard from Heaven
[1:21:27] speak to me once again let let that
[1:21:29] voice speak once again Lord Jesus I just
[1:21:32] need to hear that voice I believe that's
[1:21:33] why we come to service
[1:21:35] we don't come to service to to see one
[1:21:37] another although we do we want to shake
[1:21:39] hands with one another we want to see
[1:21:40] our brothers and sisters of like
[1:21:42] Precious faith we want to greet one
[1:21:44] another but the reason we come to
[1:21:45] service ultimately brothers and sisters
[1:21:47] is for one purpose and that's to give
[1:21:49] him praise
[1:21:51] and when we give him praise he will
[1:21:53] speak to us but if we're not willing to
[1:21:55] give him praise are we going to hear
[1:21:56] from them
[1:21:58] personally I believe that's where we're
[1:22:00] going to start to say well this should
[1:22:01] be different and that should be
[1:22:02] different and we could do something else
[1:22:04] and all these different things and well
[1:22:06] the song leader and and and and and and
[1:22:08] and you know what we're going to come to
[1:22:10] a place where we're just going to
[1:22:11] shrivel up
[1:22:13] we got to be able to let our hair down
[1:22:14] and worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:22:18] how many people in the building are
[1:22:19] married maybe raise your hand
[1:22:22] there's a lot of people here that are
[1:22:23] married there's a lot of people that are
[1:22:24] wanting to be married I know that as
[1:22:26] well you know what God created us to be
[1:22:30] man and wife and as the wife we I know
[1:22:33] it because I'm a bride I'll say that I'm
[1:22:35] a bride it's weird I know but it's true
[1:22:37] the bride of Christ we're living in the
[1:22:39] bride age we call ourselves the bride
[1:22:41] you know the the the bride half made
[1:22:44] herself ready we know who we are and the
[1:22:47] purpose that we're here but brothers and
[1:22:49] sisters we can't just have a
[1:22:52] relationship with someone and just
[1:22:53] simply say you know I love you and and
[1:22:55] maybe write a sticky note once in a
[1:22:57] while and just give it to him and stick
[1:22:59] it on the mirror and say you know don't
[1:23:00] you remember I put that note there a
[1:23:02] month ago I told you that I loved you
[1:23:04] or or maybe to the Lord Jesus when I go
[1:23:07] to service once in a while and I'll just
[1:23:09] I'll give you a sticky note Lord and
[1:23:11] I'll just put it on the on the side of
[1:23:13] my Bible or something I'll make a note
[1:23:14] in my in my notebook and say I really
[1:23:16] love you Lord and that'll be it you know
[1:23:18] what there's no relationship there when
[1:23:19] we have a relationship you want to give
[1:23:22] all that you've got your heart burns
[1:23:24] within you to express what you have
[1:23:27] inside for that other person
[1:23:30] you don't have a relationship and just
[1:23:32] hold back and just say yeah you know you
[1:23:34] know I love you
[1:23:36] you know I love you I don't have to
[1:23:37] express it to you you don't even go
[1:23:39] there you just express it because you
[1:23:42] love her she loves you we love one
[1:23:44] another so we express our love think
[1:23:47] about how that one came and actually
[1:23:49] called you before the foundation of the
[1:23:51] world brothers and sisters gave you the
[1:23:52] ability to hear this word in your day
[1:23:54] can you not express your love for him
[1:23:58] I don't know I think that this this
[1:23:59] whole worship thing is gonna go to the
[1:24:01] next level at least for me just the way
[1:24:04] the Lord is leading me and showing me
[1:24:05] this how on Earth can we keep silent we
[1:24:08] know that the Lord said to the people
[1:24:10] you know what if you hold your peace
[1:24:12] immediately the rocks will cry out think
[1:24:15] about that brothers and sisters the
[1:24:16] highest level of Life the highest form
[1:24:19] of life on Earth was told if you hold
[1:24:22] your peace the lowest level of life on
[1:24:24] Earth which isn't even alive is going to
[1:24:27] cry out what does that say to us
[1:24:30] I
[1:24:33] my goodness
[1:24:35] today I want to talk about a topic and
[1:24:38] uh I hope it's okay I want to talk about
[1:24:40] viruses
[1:24:42] I want to talk about spiritual viruses
[1:24:43] today
[1:24:46] you know we just came out of a pandemic
[1:24:48] and some would say well we're still in
[1:24:50] it and I guess indeed we are in some
[1:24:52] countries in some ways
[1:24:54] how much has our lives changed since
[1:24:57] this pandemic since this virus that just
[1:25:00] went crazy in the world
[1:25:02] now we can look at it and say it's
[1:25:04] man-made virus or it's an engineered
[1:25:06] thing and it came from a certain place
[1:25:08] and all these different things and you
[1:25:11] know what all of that is going to be a
[1:25:12] fruitless Venture and and I don't want
[1:25:14] to go down that road I don't want to
[1:25:15] even try and teach us about viruses I
[1:25:17] want to speak spiritually speaking today
[1:25:19] but we know brother random said the
[1:25:21] natural types of spiritual and and we're
[1:25:23] dealing with the situation in our lives
[1:25:25] where Satan I believe is running rampant
[1:25:28] in our lives
[1:25:31] and how's he doing at brothers and
[1:25:32] sisters it's through a spiritual virus
[1:25:35] and if we're not careful we can catch a
[1:25:37] spiritual virus and that spiritual virus
[1:25:39] we could be infected with it and not
[1:25:41] even know it
[1:25:43] some people will be infected with we
[1:25:45] know covet we have all gone through it
[1:25:47] we've all seen it we've all
[1:25:49] seen what it does to certain people and
[1:25:52] it's what makes it so mysterious and I
[1:25:53] believe the devil is just as mysterious
[1:25:56] because some people will get coveted and
[1:25:58] they won't even have a sniffle
[1:26:00] I don't know what they call it is it
[1:26:02] asymptomatic is that what it's called
[1:26:03] they won't even know they're sick
[1:26:05] there's no illness there's no signs but
[1:26:07] yet they're absolutely positive
[1:26:10] but yet they'll come around someone else
[1:26:12] and and they'll just maybe breathe and
[1:26:14] and someone will catch the moist
[1:26:16] breathing of that person and they'll
[1:26:19] catch the virus and they'll have it and
[1:26:22] and it'll put them on life support in
[1:26:23] the hospital how does that work
[1:26:26] I just believe it's that subtle with the
[1:26:28] Devil and you know brothers and sisters
[1:26:30] it's just been on my heart I think that
[1:26:31] we can deal with something very similar
[1:26:33] to that spiritually speaking if we're
[1:26:35] not careful and and we have to guard
[1:26:37] ourselves how careful Have We Become
[1:26:39] just in general from dealing with this
[1:26:43] virus in the world I know I myself I've
[1:26:46] got a bottle of sanitizer in my truck I
[1:26:49] maybe I'm a fanatic for having it but I
[1:26:52] just think you know what I want to be a
[1:26:53] little bit prudent about this if I go
[1:26:55] and handle a gas pump I don't want to
[1:26:57] just do that and then just pretend
[1:26:58] everything is okay I want to be a little
[1:27:01] bit prudent we know that if we still go
[1:27:03] into certain places certain facilities
[1:27:05] we have to put on a mask
[1:27:07] whether the masks work or not I'm not
[1:27:09] here to debate that that's not what I'm
[1:27:11] talking about what I'm talking about is
[1:27:13] we're taking precautions as human beings
[1:27:15] because we recognize there's something
[1:27:17] many people will say well I know brother
[1:27:20] Barry it's exactly this and that and the
[1:27:21] other and I could just scientifically
[1:27:23] explain it and other people will say I
[1:27:25] don't think it's real at all
[1:27:27] but some people have died some loved
[1:27:29] ones have died what's going on something
[1:27:32] is happening in the world brothers and
[1:27:33] sisters I think everyone here could
[1:27:35] relate to that to say yes indeed
[1:27:37] something strange has happened and even
[1:27:40] to the point where the whole entire
[1:27:41] world could be affected by this now
[1:27:47] when we look at it
[1:27:50] it's very important to make sure that
[1:27:52] that that we recognize we're not
[1:27:54] wrestling against flesh and blood
[1:27:55] brothers and sisters
[1:27:57] we're wrestling against principalities
[1:27:59] and Powers
[1:28:01] it's not a flesh and blood struggle that
[1:28:03] we're contending with here in North
[1:28:05] America we've got everything made in the
[1:28:07] shade
[1:28:08] there's no issues here
[1:28:10] if you look at the rest of the world
[1:28:12] truly we are that one percent
[1:28:15] we can just go and make money if we need
[1:28:16] to we can just go and get a job we can
[1:28:18] just go and find money it's available we
[1:28:20] can just go and get jobs there's people
[1:28:22] in the world that are born into families
[1:28:24] they have no hope those children will
[1:28:26] never have hope their entire lives
[1:28:28] unless somebody comes along and gives
[1:28:30] them a leg up somebody gives them a
[1:28:31] helping hand aside from that brothers
[1:28:33] and sisters they'll never go to school
[1:28:34] they'll never be educated they'll
[1:28:36] they'll just be lucky to survive
[1:28:38] and and that is just a fact that's the
[1:28:40] way it is in the world but we on the
[1:28:42] other hand have it real good we've got
[1:28:44] it real easy in terms of that we don't
[1:28:46] have to struggle that way we don't have
[1:28:48] to take our children to the hospital and
[1:28:50] determine which child if we have more
[1:28:52] than one child in a hospital we don't
[1:28:54] have to say let's have a prayer meeting
[1:28:56] to decide who can get the medication
[1:28:59] that we need because we've only got
[1:29:00] limited funds to treat one of our
[1:29:02] children which one of those children now
[1:29:04] is going to be the one that gets to live
[1:29:05] and which one of those children is going
[1:29:07] to be the one that we can just commit to
[1:29:08] the Lord and hope that he saves that
[1:29:10] child that's not a game that we have to
[1:29:11] play but it's a very real thing in many
[1:29:14] other countries in the world
[1:29:16] and people can be infected people can
[1:29:19] get sick and get that way
[1:29:21] what got me thinking about this I'll
[1:29:23] tell you is Ezekiel the scripture in
[1:29:25] Ezekiel chapter nine if you want to turn
[1:29:27] there with me this morning we could uh
[1:29:32] we could just
[1:29:34] maybe talk about this here
[1:29:39] how do we get into spiritual viruses
[1:29:43] well
[1:29:59] Ezekiel chapter nine let's start with
[1:30:01] verse one
[1:30:03] he cried also in my ears
[1:30:06] with a loud voice
[1:30:08] saying cause them
[1:30:10] that have charged over the city to draw
[1:30:13] near
[1:30:14] even every man with his destroying
[1:30:16] weapon in his hand
[1:30:18] and behold six men came from the way of
[1:30:21] the higher gate which lieth toward the
[1:30:23] North and every man a Slaughter weapon
[1:30:25] in his hand and one man among them was
[1:30:28] clothed with linen
[1:30:30] and a writer's incorn by his side
[1:30:33] and they went in and Stood Beside the
[1:30:35] Brazen altar
[1:30:38] and the glory
[1:30:40] of the god of Israel was gone up from
[1:30:42] the Cherub where on he was to the
[1:30:44] threshold of the house and he called to
[1:30:47] the man clothed with linen which had the
[1:30:50] writer's incorn by his side
[1:30:52] and the Lord said unto him go through
[1:30:55] the midst of the city
[1:30:57] through the midst of Jerusalem and set a
[1:31:01] mark on the foreheads of the men that
[1:31:03] sigh and cry for all the Abominations
[1:31:06] that be done in the midst thereof
[1:31:11] and to the others
[1:31:12] he said in my hearing
[1:31:15] go ye after him through the city and
[1:31:18] smite
[1:31:20] let not your eyes spare
[1:31:22] neither have ye pity
[1:31:25] slay utterly old and young both maids
[1:31:28] and little children and woman
[1:31:30] and come not near any man upon whom is
[1:31:33] the mark
[1:31:35] and begin at My Sanctuary
[1:31:39] then they began at the ancient men
[1:31:42] which were before the house
[1:31:44] and he said unto them defile the house
[1:31:46] and fill the courts with the slain go ye
[1:31:50] forth and they went forth and slew in
[1:31:52] the city and it came to pass while they
[1:31:54] were slaying them and I was left that I
[1:31:58] fell on my face and cried and said ah
[1:32:00] Lord God will thou destroy all the
[1:32:03] residue of Israel in thy pouring out of
[1:32:06] thy Fury upon Jerusalem
[1:32:09] then he said unto me
[1:32:11] the iniquity of the House of Israel and
[1:32:13] Judah is exceeding great
[1:32:16] and the land is full of blood and the
[1:32:18] City full of perverseness
[1:32:21] for they say the Lord hath forsaken the
[1:32:23] Earth
[1:32:24] and the Lord seeth not
[1:32:27] and as for me also mine I shall not
[1:32:29] spare neither will I have pity but I
[1:32:32] will recompense their way upon their
[1:32:34] head and behold the man clothed with
[1:32:36] linen which had the ink horn by his side
[1:32:39] reported the matter saying I have done
[1:32:42] as thou Hast commanded me
[1:32:46] we've had many conversations about this
[1:32:48] scripture and brothers and sisters this
[1:32:51] is a sign this is an example of getting
[1:32:53] the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:32:55] only those people who really truly get
[1:32:57] the baptism of the holy spirit will be
[1:33:00] marked in their forehead they will have
[1:33:01] the mark from this man clothed in linen
[1:33:04] with the ink horn and once we have that
[1:33:07] Mark then we cannot be touched we can't
[1:33:09] be slain
[1:33:11] even if there is a virus that goes
[1:33:12] around Naturally Speaking
[1:33:14] because whether we live or whether we
[1:33:16] die we're Christ we know exactly whom we
[1:33:19] have believed and you know we don't have
[1:33:21] to live in fear but isn't it interesting
[1:33:23] even amongst Believers we see folks who
[1:33:26] are scared to death
[1:33:28] of getting a sickness that could hurt
[1:33:30] them that could kill them why is that
[1:33:33] why are we afraid if we believe
[1:33:37] I want to ask that question and I want
[1:33:39] to let it soak why would we be afraid if
[1:33:42] we believe we've got our families and
[1:33:44] we've got our friends
[1:33:45] but when we know that God is completely
[1:33:47] in control what do we have to fear but
[1:33:50] that's really I think what the problem
[1:33:52] is like the children of Israel said that
[1:33:54] the Lord hath forsaken the earth and the
[1:33:56] Lord seeth not
[1:33:59] maybe he doesn't see that I have a virus
[1:34:01] maybe he doesn't see that I get sick
[1:34:03] maybe he doesn't see that I'm upset
[1:34:05] maybe he doesn't see that a brother or
[1:34:06] sister stepped on my toes and I'm really
[1:34:08] upset by it and I don't know how to deal
[1:34:10] with it maybe he doesn't see any of that
[1:34:12] brothers and sisters he saw all of that
[1:34:14] before the foundation of the world and
[1:34:16] he positionally placed us to go through
[1:34:17] it not so that we could be destroyed so
[1:34:19] that we could overcome it when we look
[1:34:21] at the weaknesses in our lives it's not
[1:34:23] so the weaknesses in our lives can
[1:34:24] destroy us he's not looking at the
[1:34:26] weaknesses in our lives he's looking at
[1:34:27] the theophany that he created for us
[1:34:30] that body that he has already made
[1:34:32] imperfection waiting for us on the other
[1:34:34] side he's not worried or wondering he's
[1:34:36] not upset or surprised by Our Lives he's
[1:34:39] just waiting for the manifestation of
[1:34:41] the sons of God because he knows that
[1:34:42] everyone that he chose before the
[1:34:44] foundation of the world will come
[1:34:45] everyone will come to full maturity in
[1:34:48] their time
[1:34:52] we're not wondering whether the Lord has
[1:34:53] forsaken us
[1:34:55] or whether the Lord seeth not
[1:34:57] those those are the people that don't
[1:35:00] have the mark
[1:35:01] those are the people that are afraid to
[1:35:03] die
[1:35:04] those are the ones that say is Mark 16
[1:35:06] really still in action is there really
[1:35:10] bomb in Gilead because I pray and I
[1:35:13] don't see a change
[1:35:15] the greatest Miracle brothers and
[1:35:16] sisters isn't to see the first and
[1:35:18] second pull in our lives in fact we're
[1:35:20] not living in the first and second pole
[1:35:22] Ministry we're living in the third pull
[1:35:23] ministry that's the opening of the word
[1:35:25] that's the recognition of who we are
[1:35:27] that's recognizing that we are he that
[1:35:31] truly when we speak it's deity speaking
[1:35:34] you know we have the mind of Christ and
[1:35:36] we know what to do with the word of the
[1:35:38] lord we don't have to be still some
[1:35:40] people will want to be still because
[1:35:42] they don't know where they stand they
[1:35:43] haven't really maybe matured that way
[1:35:45] and that's the way it goes we're all on
[1:35:48] a walk but we don't want to put anybody
[1:35:49] out and say you're just not mature
[1:35:51] enough we want to encourage one another
[1:35:53] when we see a child walking and
[1:35:56] stumbling we want to help them we don't
[1:35:58] want to tell them stupid child why'd you
[1:36:00] trip and fall we want to pick them up
[1:36:02] and encourage them and say you're doing
[1:36:03] a great job look at you walk two steps
[1:36:06] you know if you try again you'll walk
[1:36:09] two more and before long you'll be
[1:36:10] running as a child
[1:36:13] as Sons and Daughters of God that's what
[1:36:15] we want to do
[1:36:16] we know that the Lord has not forsaken
[1:36:18] the Earth and that the Lord sees
[1:36:21] everything the word of God says that his
[1:36:23] eyes are everywhere and he perceives it
[1:36:27] all he's aware of everything that's
[1:36:29] going on in our lives he's even aware of
[1:36:32] what we're thinking right now brother
[1:36:34] Bradham says you know this man clothed
[1:36:36] in linen he was actually set to go
[1:36:39] through the city and Mark those that
[1:36:41] sighed and cried for the Abominations in
[1:36:44] the land I mentioned this last Sunday I
[1:36:46] think it was maybe it was Wednesday it
[1:36:48] was both but I mentioned it because
[1:36:50] really brother Bradham says that this is
[1:36:52] truly the evidence of the Holy Ghost in
[1:36:55] our lives are we sighing and crying for
[1:36:58] the Abominations in the Latin brothers
[1:37:00] and sisters because if we're not sighing
[1:37:02] and crying for the Abominations in the
[1:37:04] land I'm not going to say you don't have
[1:37:06] the Holy Ghost what I want to say is
[1:37:07] perhaps we've just become distracted
[1:37:10] with the cares of life so much so that
[1:37:13] we're not aware of what day we're really
[1:37:15] living in because if Luke 17 30 really
[1:37:18] is something that's revealed to us then
[1:37:21] brother sister any moment now any moment
[1:37:24] now fire is going to rain from heaven
[1:37:27] but before that fire can rain from
[1:37:29] heaven
[1:37:30] the instant
[1:37:32] in the moment and the twinkling of an
[1:37:34] eye
[1:37:36] we know the bride's gonna go
[1:37:38] isn't it interesting I don't know what
[1:37:40] the formula is I had a brother I just
[1:37:41] want to say it I had a brother say it
[1:37:43] exactly what the calculation is what the
[1:37:46] twinkling of an eye is there's a
[1:37:47] definition in the in the dictionary that
[1:37:49] says what a twinkling of an eye is and
[1:37:51] if you look at the the the speed of
[1:37:53] light and you think about the twinkling
[1:37:55] of an eye that's faster than we can
[1:37:56] think brothers and sisters we can't even
[1:37:58] blink our eye as fast as a twinkle is in
[1:38:01] our eye because it's actually the speed
[1:38:03] of light reflecting off of our eye it's
[1:38:05] a tremendous thought but you know he's
[1:38:08] searching
[1:38:09] for those who are sighing and crying for
[1:38:11] the Abominations in the land and now
[1:38:13] this is where I want to get to this is
[1:38:15] where we're sort of getting into the
[1:38:17] main course now and and I think we're
[1:38:19] right on track I'm so happy about that
[1:38:21] what what I want to talk about is the
[1:38:23] spiritual viruses brothers and sisters
[1:38:24] where people can become infected with a
[1:38:26] spiritual virus and not even know it and
[1:38:28] and what they'll do is think that it's
[1:38:30] somebody else somebody else has caused a
[1:38:33] problem so now they have to separate
[1:38:35] themselves from the rest of the group
[1:38:37] not understanding that spiritually they
[1:38:39] have an illness there's something wrong
[1:38:41] there's something isn't right because
[1:38:43] the spirit of the Lord is where there is
[1:38:45] Unity not separation
[1:38:48] but sometimes people become infected
[1:38:51] with a spiritual virus and don't even
[1:38:53] know it and and this is where I I want
[1:38:56] to get into today brothers and sisters I
[1:38:58] don't want to say that we need to be
[1:38:59] sighing and crying for the Abominations
[1:39:01] in the land where we're talking about
[1:39:03] the transgenderism and all of the sinful
[1:39:06] natures and we can see all that around
[1:39:08] us and sure it makes us sigh and cry but
[1:39:11] you know what's worse is when people get
[1:39:13] upset and they leave church when people
[1:39:15] get upset and they can't fellowship with
[1:39:17] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[1:39:19] Faith you know there's something wrong
[1:39:21] there and we were having a conversation
[1:39:22] about it just yesterday but brothers and
[1:39:24] sisters to me my way of thinking that's
[1:39:27] the Abomination that's in the land and
[1:39:29] it's not that that person is creating an
[1:39:31] Abomination it's the devil that's doing
[1:39:33] it the devil is saying that God's eye is
[1:39:36] not on us people God is not aware of
[1:39:38] what's going on God is very aware of
[1:39:40] what's going on and he allows the
[1:39:42] circumstances and situations to come up
[1:39:44] to see how we're going to react to them
[1:39:50] sometimes we get situations where we get
[1:39:52] a virus and
[1:39:54] you know the viruses never really leave
[1:39:56] viruses stick around a while
[1:40:00] we can get treatments for viruses but
[1:40:02] really what has to happen is the body
[1:40:04] the body needs to
[1:40:06] be able to overcome
[1:40:09] that virus that's inside of us
[1:40:12] but speaking about a spiritual virus
[1:40:13] brothers and sisters we don't have to
[1:40:15] tolerate that
[1:40:16] we don't have to say I've got this thing
[1:40:19] and and I just can't deal with it and
[1:40:21] and so now I'm just gonna separate
[1:40:23] myselves from the body
[1:40:26] that's not that's not
[1:40:29] not something we need to do
[1:40:32] the bottom talks about what the Holy
[1:40:34] Spirit evidence was
[1:40:37] and
[1:40:38] forgive me it's out of questions and
[1:40:40] answers number three
[1:40:43] holy spirit it's paragraph 69 if you
[1:40:46] want to bring it up if you can
[1:40:53] now what let me just give you a little
[1:40:55] twister here
[1:40:56] just a minute
[1:40:57] I'd say how many has the Holy Ghost
[1:41:00] all of you raise up your hand I'd say
[1:41:02] all right I'll see if you have
[1:41:05] the Bible said that they that had the
[1:41:07] Holy Ghost sighed and cried
[1:41:10] night
[1:41:12] day and night for the Abominations done
[1:41:14] in the city
[1:41:16] now how many hand would go up
[1:41:19] how many of you can't rest at night so
[1:41:22] full of joy the power of God
[1:41:26] and so sad for the people that's lost
[1:41:29] that day and night You Weep and cry for
[1:41:32] the Abominations
[1:41:34] you won't see who would be in the city
[1:41:38] who would be that in the city how many
[1:41:41] is that's in the church
[1:41:43] that's what the Bible said
[1:41:46] the Holy Spirit evidence was
[1:41:50] he told the ceiling Angel Ezekiel 9.
[1:41:52] that's right
[1:41:53] he said take go through the city and set
[1:41:55] a mark on those who sigh and cry for the
[1:41:57] Abominations in the city
[1:42:00] the rest of them let the destroying
[1:42:03] Angel destroy them
[1:42:06] no matter how much members they was
[1:42:09] how many of the things they've done
[1:42:12] said put a and a man with an incorn
[1:42:15] writer dressed in white which
[1:42:17] represented the Holy Spirit came forth
[1:42:19] and put a mark upon all them that sighed
[1:42:23] and cried for the Abominations done in
[1:42:25] the city
[1:42:26] now you say and watch what he said in
[1:42:29] there also
[1:42:31] slay utterly the children old women
[1:42:33] babies kill them all little children yes
[1:42:38] I just think it's so important for us to
[1:42:40] recognize brothers and sisters
[1:42:42] that was naturally speaking and now
[1:42:45] today we're spiritually speaking
[1:42:48] and talking about spiritual viruses
[1:42:49] Spirits travel on words
[1:42:52] and and when we speak
[1:42:55] we're either going to speak the Oracles
[1:42:58] of God
[1:42:59] or we're going to speak carnally of this
[1:43:01] world
[1:43:03] and the devil is so slick he will
[1:43:06] totally entangle himself in words if we
[1:43:09] have a negative thought
[1:43:12] a word is a thought expressed because we
[1:43:16] have a thought doesn't mean we have to
[1:43:18] express
[1:43:19] that thought as a word
[1:43:22] but there's something inside of a human
[1:43:24] that the devil plays upon where he'll
[1:43:27] say even as a believer
[1:43:29] we know that we can actually talk about
[1:43:32] a brother or a sister because of
[1:43:34] whatever it is maybe it's a cultural
[1:43:36] thing maybe it's a traditional thing
[1:43:37] maybe it's a family thing we can say
[1:43:39] because there's a situation now we can
[1:43:42] speak bad about a situation no you can't
[1:43:46] not according to the word of God what's
[1:43:48] going to happen brothers and sisters is
[1:43:50] we're going to actually now influence
[1:43:52] another person and brother Bradham I
[1:43:54] wanted to bring up the quote but I just
[1:43:56] didn't get there this morning I
[1:43:57] apologize but brother Branham he says
[1:43:59] that you don't have to kill a man
[1:44:01] you can just assassinate his character
[1:44:04] all you have to do is talk bad about a
[1:44:06] brother or talk bad about a sister and
[1:44:08] you can assassinate their character and
[1:44:10] he also says that we'll answer for that
[1:44:12] one day
[1:44:14] and it's okay when it's privately behind
[1:44:16] closed doors but remember even though
[1:44:19] those people said that his eyes are not
[1:44:21] seeing what's going on he is very aware
[1:44:24] of what's going on
[1:44:26] because the word of God says that I'll
[1:44:28] say it this way not the word of God the
[1:44:30] prophet in our day said that our
[1:44:32] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[1:44:34] words are so many times we don't even
[1:44:36] express all of the thoughts that are in
[1:44:38] our our hearts that that really we think
[1:44:41] and and you know brother Toby brought it
[1:44:43] so good just because we have thoughts
[1:44:44] come doesn't mean that needs to dictate
[1:44:46] our thinking if we're feeding in the
[1:44:48] right place what we're going to do is
[1:44:51] draw the right thoughts into our body
[1:44:54] and and we know that the word of God
[1:44:56] says to take every thought into
[1:44:57] captivity not some thoughts and most
[1:44:59] thoughts and say that you know what I've
[1:45:00] just got this thing it's it's a it's a
[1:45:02] cultural thing or it's a it's a genetic
[1:45:05] thing for my family and I just speak
[1:45:06] faster than I think you know we need to
[1:45:08] slow down we need to maybe change things
[1:45:11] in our lives so that we can be according
[1:45:13] to the word of God it says to take every
[1:45:15] single thought into captivity
[1:45:17] and then speak
[1:45:20] think about what's come into our heads
[1:45:22] and say is it something that I should
[1:45:24] say and and I'll say hey you know what
[1:45:25] brothers and sisters I'm the first one
[1:45:27] that needs to come to and there's
[1:45:28] probably people saying Amen brother
[1:45:30] because you're the preacher you've got
[1:45:32] to watch what you say from here I have
[1:45:34] to be filtering these thoughts quickly
[1:45:36] so that I can speak the right words
[1:45:38] because if I come here and I start
[1:45:40] speaking the wrong thing brothers and
[1:45:42] sisters I can infect
[1:45:44] people with a spiritual virus
[1:45:48] and we'll feel just fine we'll leave
[1:45:49] this building and everything will be
[1:45:51] just fine we'll say wow it was a great
[1:45:52] service tremendous service brother Barry
[1:45:55] I hope you'd say that
[1:45:57] but it could feel that way it could
[1:45:59] appear that way for all intents and
[1:46:00] purposes but something could have been
[1:46:03] said that's not right that's not true
[1:46:05] and if we don't deal with it accordingly
[1:46:07] it can infect people
[1:46:09] it can cause an infection and really
[1:46:11] what happens is people get infected and
[1:46:13] they don't realize it and then they
[1:46:15] start to look at a brother when they'll
[1:46:16] say well that brother did this to me and
[1:46:19] and don't anybody doesn't anybody know
[1:46:21] that this brother did this to me doesn't
[1:46:22] everybody care that this brother did
[1:46:24] this to me and before long they can go
[1:46:27] and talk to another brother or another
[1:46:28] sister and what happens is that
[1:46:30] spiritual virus just keeps getting
[1:46:32] passed and getting passed and sometimes
[1:46:34] people who pass it it doesn't affect
[1:46:36] them at all and sometimes other people
[1:46:38] it affects them to the place where it'll
[1:46:40] almost put them in the grave
[1:46:42] and many times we don't even recognize
[1:46:44] it because we just feel the same we're
[1:46:46] normal human beings but Spirits are
[1:46:48] traveling in our words that's why we
[1:46:51] have to take our thoughts into captivity
[1:46:52] just because we have a thought doesn't
[1:46:54] mean that's our thinking
[1:46:56] our thinking is according to the word of
[1:46:58] God our thinking is always going to say
[1:47:00] but what does the word of God say about
[1:47:02] the situation what does the word of God
[1:47:04] say about that thought what does the
[1:47:06] word of God say about my brother what
[1:47:08] does the word of God say about me
[1:47:11] we're always going to bring it back to
[1:47:13] that
[1:47:15] brother Branham he goes on to say
[1:47:20] uh same one yes it is set of questions
[1:47:21] and answers
[1:47:23] certainly powerful anything that denies
[1:47:25] the word of God
[1:47:27] brothers and sisters we need to just
[1:47:29] take a step back and take a breath
[1:47:32] and not not not cause a fight not cause
[1:47:34] a Schism or a problem with our brother
[1:47:37] or our sister but anything that denies
[1:47:38] the word of God we just need to say hold
[1:47:40] on a second and we need to think about
[1:47:42] that for a second when Joshua entered
[1:47:44] the land of Canaan he said don't you let
[1:47:47] any of them live
[1:47:49] if it's a cute little baby
[1:47:51] a little amalekite or an Amorite kill it
[1:47:55] he said you remember he'll grow up to be
[1:47:57] an amalekite
[1:47:59] and he'll pollute the camp
[1:48:01] we know that we've heard it said many
[1:48:03] times Jesus taught that when we make
[1:48:06] bread a little bit of Leaven will leaven
[1:48:08] the whole lump
[1:48:09] and a little bit of yeast a little bit
[1:48:11] of yeast there it'll it'll grow and
[1:48:14] manifest and grow and manifest and
[1:48:15] multiply and manifest and it'll it'll
[1:48:17] it'll it'll take over the whole thing
[1:48:19] you won't have to do a thing it'll it'll
[1:48:21] become leavened bread and and if we just
[1:48:24] let the little things go in our lives
[1:48:26] brothers and sisters then what's going
[1:48:27] to happen is it's just going to manifest
[1:48:29] and it's just going to grow and manifest
[1:48:31] and grow and we need to kill that thing
[1:48:33] when it happens
[1:48:35] and I want to say this very clearly I I
[1:48:38] had an experience I said it in the men's
[1:48:40] meeting I'll say it in front of everyone
[1:48:41] I had a time in my life where I had an
[1:48:44] issue with a brother and I wanted to go
[1:48:46] and I wanted to smack talk that brother
[1:48:48] because I was right I felt like I was
[1:48:50] done wrong
[1:48:51] and that made it right right I wanted to
[1:48:54] go on smack talk about this brother to
[1:48:56] another brother
[1:48:57] and I thought for sure that he would
[1:48:58] listen to me and everything would be
[1:49:00] okay we'd be high-fiving that you were
[1:49:02] done wrong and everything was right and
[1:49:03] we'll go and pray for that brother
[1:49:04] because he's our brother right and what
[1:49:07] happened was that brother said to me you
[1:49:08] know what shut your mouth I don't want
[1:49:10] to hear another word that's my brother
[1:49:12] and I don't care what happened he's my
[1:49:14] brother and he's filled with the Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost just like you're filled with the
[1:49:17] Holy Ghost go away and don't bother me
[1:49:19] with any of it and you know what that
[1:49:21] did was that changed my life I might
[1:49:23] have said this from the pulpit if I
[1:49:24] haven't or if I have I I hope it's
[1:49:26] beneficial to someone brothers and
[1:49:28] sisters don't listen to smack talk about
[1:49:31] a brother or a sister that's evil that's
[1:49:33] the devil speaking and if you don't
[1:49:35] think that that's true think about when
[1:49:37] Peter the rock the one who Jesus chose
[1:49:40] to give that Revelation to he said my
[1:49:43] Father in Heaven gave you that
[1:49:44] Revelation Peter you're the one that
[1:49:46] we're going to build the church on and
[1:49:48] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[1:49:49] it we know that that's the Catholic
[1:49:51] church that said that but we know as
[1:49:53] Believers it was the Revelation that was
[1:49:55] given to him
[1:49:57] how many other of the disciples wish
[1:49:59] that they were the ones I want that
[1:50:00] Revelation why would you just give it to
[1:50:02] him and not me not knowing that he gave
[1:50:04] it to everyone
[1:50:05] but he just manifested it through him
[1:50:06] but we know that one is the one that he
[1:50:09] said no no nobody's going to take you up
[1:50:11] and kill you because I'm gonna fight to
[1:50:12] die I'll die before they take you and he
[1:50:15] said get behind me Satan he didn't say
[1:50:16] get behind me Peter because he
[1:50:18] recognized The Voice
[1:50:20] the words that were being spoken were
[1:50:23] not words
[1:50:24] encouraging
[1:50:27] wasn't according to scripture
[1:50:30] brothers and sisters it's not okay to
[1:50:32] smack talk it's not okay to say negative
[1:50:34] things about a brother or sister whether
[1:50:35] you're in a car whether you're in a back
[1:50:37] alley whether you're under a bus whether
[1:50:40] you're in a house whether you're in a
[1:50:42] sanctuary whether you're in a basement
[1:50:43] whether you're on an airplane whether
[1:50:45] you're on a private island somewhere
[1:50:47] totally secluded away from everyone in
[1:50:50] the world God's listening and so is
[1:50:53] Satan
[1:50:54] it's a spiritual virus that we're gonna
[1:50:56] pass if we do that but if we take the
[1:50:59] thoughts into captivity and recognize
[1:51:01] that's contrary to the word of God
[1:51:04] Satan will be powerless before us
[1:51:06] brothers and sisters
[1:51:08] you know what this is just one Avenue
[1:51:10] that I believe Satan has access to the
[1:51:12] Bride of Jesus Christ and that's why I'm
[1:51:14] preaching it today that's why I feel it
[1:51:16] necessary to talk about it's no accident
[1:51:18] that we just went through a pandemic
[1:51:20] brothers and sisters
[1:51:22] but we don't have to tolerate Satan and
[1:51:24] his antics we can say to him you know
[1:51:27] what I know that thought is from you
[1:51:28] Satan and you just need to remember this
[1:51:30] one thing
[1:51:31] this one thing Satan that Revelations 10
[1:51:34] 20 sorry verse 10 says that you're going
[1:51:37] to be cast alive into the burning Lake
[1:51:39] of Fire where the Beast and the false
[1:51:41] prophet already are brother Branham says
[1:51:43] it Satan hates the Book of Revelation
[1:51:45] and he hates the Book of Genesis and the
[1:51:47] reason he hates it is because it shows
[1:51:48] his beginning as The Serpent and it
[1:51:50] shows his end as as the Beast as the the
[1:51:53] serpent again it's the same serpent the
[1:51:57] devil that old serpent is the way
[1:51:58] Revelation words it why does it say that
[1:52:01] it's not because he's throwing a snake
[1:52:03] into the Lake of Fire he's identifying
[1:52:06] it's the very same spirit that was there
[1:52:08] in the garden of Edom that entered into
[1:52:10] that serpent but he's going to be cast
[1:52:12] alive into that Lake of Fire and you
[1:52:14] know what will happen when we do that
[1:52:15] he'll flee
[1:52:17] because the word of God says to
[1:52:20] submit yourself therefore
[1:52:22] unto God first
[1:52:24] and then resist the devil and heal free
[1:52:27] to take that thought into captivity when
[1:52:29] a brother and a sister does it and you
[1:52:31] know what we don't have to fight I'll
[1:52:32] have to say shut your mouth
[1:52:35] I needed it that way I had to hear it
[1:52:38] that way many times in my life I need to
[1:52:40] get that that two by four smack to
[1:52:42] really understand something and many
[1:52:45] other times I just need a simple
[1:52:46] conversation just for the record
[1:52:48] you don't have to beat me up I can hear
[1:52:50] and I'll listen
[1:52:53] but you know what I'm saying brothers
[1:52:54] and sisters we can simply say you know
[1:52:56] what politely I I I just don't think I
[1:52:58] agree with you and I'm not willing to go
[1:53:00] down that road of actually speaking
[1:53:02] negative about anyone because the word
[1:53:04] of God says that we should speak
[1:53:05] positive about everyone the prophet for
[1:53:08] our day said say nice things about your
[1:53:11] brothers and your sisters so where would
[1:53:13] we have the opportunity to speak evil
[1:53:14] about anyone
[1:53:16] we don't there isn't
[1:53:20] anything that denies the word of God
[1:53:22] watch out when Joshua entered the land
[1:53:25] of King this is Brother Brown speaking
[1:53:26] he said don't you let one of them live
[1:53:28] if it's a cute little baby a little
[1:53:29] amalekite or an Amorite kill it you
[1:53:31] remember he'll grow up to be in a
[1:53:33] malachite he'll pollute the camp and
[1:53:35] when those little things come back like
[1:53:37] that disagreeing with the word of God
[1:53:40] get rid of that thing he says I don't
[1:53:43] care what denomination it belongs to
[1:53:46] interesting how he goes from the story
[1:53:47] of Joshua and Kanan to talking about a
[1:53:50] denomination and where this thing came
[1:53:52] from because you know what we deal with
[1:53:54] those things even in the message of the
[1:53:55] hour we drag traditional teachings into
[1:53:58] the message of the hour many times not
[1:54:00] even knowing it
[1:54:02] but all we need to do is humble
[1:54:03] ourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[1:54:05] he'll Lift us up if we're willing to do
[1:54:07] that
[1:54:10] says well you say Well they're good I
[1:54:13] don't care how good of people they are
[1:54:14] if they're contrary to the word get the
[1:54:17] thing out of you get away from it
[1:54:19] brothers and sisters don't listen to it
[1:54:21] if you listen to it you're going to
[1:54:23] become it it will get on you
[1:54:26] he says well they're good I don't care
[1:54:28] how good of people they are if they're
[1:54:29] contrary to the word get the thing out
[1:54:31] of you it's it's a growing little
[1:54:33] amalekite looks cute looks innocent it
[1:54:36] looks like it's all right but don't you
[1:54:38] have anything to do with it you stay
[1:54:41] away from it
[1:54:42] now I'm going to say this don't don't
[1:54:44] stay away from my brother and sister
[1:54:45] don't say no they're they're they're to
[1:54:47] Malachite and they talk negative so I'm
[1:54:49] never going to be around them you know
[1:54:51] if you have a friend that has that
[1:54:54] tendency and they're a Believer try and
[1:54:56] be the encouragement to them
[1:54:58] we have the ability to do that we know
[1:55:00] that we can cover a multitude of sins
[1:55:01] that's what the word of God says right
[1:55:04] but it also says
[1:55:06] that evil speaking corrupt conversation
[1:55:09] what does that do
[1:55:11] that upsets the righteous
[1:55:14] it can be
[1:55:17] it can be a cute little amalekite but if
[1:55:19] it denies the word stay away from my
[1:55:20] brother Adam says he goes on to say who
[1:55:22] sigh and cry for the Abomination that's
[1:55:24] in the city
[1:55:26] where did you see that I can show you
[1:55:27] ten thousand speaking in tongues to one
[1:55:29] that's really burdened for sin that
[1:55:32] can't even pray an hour but did you know
[1:55:35] the Bible said Mark only those who
[1:55:37] sighed and cried for the Abominations in
[1:55:39] the city how many you ever read it sure
[1:55:41] that was the Holy Spirit come forth to
[1:55:44] Mark the people and said to the
[1:55:46] destroying Angel go forth and destroy
[1:55:49] everything that doesn't have the mark
[1:55:51] upon them
[1:55:54] and the mark of God
[1:55:55] is the Holy Ghost
[1:55:57] is the Seal of God
[1:56:00] and you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:56:01] what we talked about there a week ago
[1:56:02] wasn't it or two even already Easter
[1:56:06] the Easter seal of God
[1:56:09] that seal
[1:56:10] containing death was broken because he
[1:56:12] overwhelmed the grave he totally
[1:56:14] overtook all of his enemies in a
[1:56:17] triumphal measure totally made an open
[1:56:20] triumph over all of it
[1:56:23] but that Holy Ghost is the Seal of God
[1:56:27] today talking about viruses spiritually
[1:56:30] speaking nasty little creatures
[1:56:35] and I want to say devils
[1:56:37] you know what they do they live off the
[1:56:38] life of other beings that's what viruses
[1:56:40] do they can't live unless they have a
[1:56:42] host unless there's a place for them to
[1:56:44] live unless there's a place for them to
[1:56:46] hide unless there's something that's
[1:56:48] willing to give them a residence
[1:56:51] you know there's viruses Naturally
[1:56:53] Speaking that we can't control there's
[1:56:55] nothing that we can do about it
[1:56:56] sometimes we'll get them I believe we
[1:56:59] can get them in in the full measure of
[1:57:01] them and Mark 16 is in full swing
[1:57:03] brothers and sisters it's fully underway
[1:57:05] in our lives we can say it doesn't
[1:57:07] matter what happens to us and that's why
[1:57:09] I say personally we all have to take our
[1:57:11] own choice about it I don't know where
[1:57:12] anybody stands it's your own thing but
[1:57:14] whether we live or we die we're Christ
[1:57:16] so if I could be free to move about and
[1:57:18] you're going to stick a needle in my arm
[1:57:20] that could be genetically engineered
[1:57:22] something that's going to potentially at
[1:57:24] someone's will change me into another
[1:57:26] being or whatever it's going to do
[1:57:28] modify my genetics or whatever I don't
[1:57:31] care put the needle in my arm because
[1:57:32] Mark 16 says that nothing can harm me
[1:57:35] unless God says that it will harm me I'm
[1:57:37] not afraid of that just like I'm not
[1:57:39] afraid to get the virus if I've got to
[1:57:41] get the virus God wants me to go and get
[1:57:43] the virus then give me the virus that's
[1:57:44] okay
[1:57:45] he can't touch my soul this flesh is
[1:57:48] gonna perish brothers and sisters but it
[1:57:50] can't change the quickening power
[1:57:52] that's what we talked about with the
[1:57:53] Easter meetings but these little viruses
[1:57:55] they need hosts they need places to live
[1:57:57] they need places to hide spiritually
[1:57:59] speaking the same thing they need places
[1:58:01] to live they need places to hide and if
[1:58:03] we can actually just not give them a
[1:58:05] place to live and not give them a place
[1:58:06] to hide they're going to die they're
[1:58:08] going to shrivel up and say there's no
[1:58:09] point going around Calgary Living Word
[1:58:11] assembly because there's nowhere for us
[1:58:12] to hide every time we get sent to go and
[1:58:15] attack those people they always overcome
[1:58:17] us because they're not willing to allow
[1:58:19] any virus into the camp
[1:58:20] we have the ability to do that brothers
[1:58:22] and sisters otherwise if we don't
[1:58:25] recognize our position what happens
[1:58:28] the virus gets in we have conversations
[1:58:30] it's okay we'll pray for our brother our
[1:58:32] sister we'll we'll we'll do something
[1:58:34] for them and we'll hope that that
[1:58:36] they'll just be able to get over it
[1:58:38] because we'll pray for them we'll
[1:58:39] remember them in a prayer meeting now
[1:58:41] that we've slaughtered them in the
[1:58:43] conversation that we've had about them
[1:58:44] but you know
[1:58:46] will it change
[1:58:48] or will that virus reproduce
[1:58:52] I want to say that virus will reproduce
[1:58:54] if we're not taking that thought into
[1:58:56] captivity and saying nope don't want
[1:58:58] nothing to do with it I'm going to break
[1:58:59] that chain of custody right now it's not
[1:59:01] going any further than this conversation
[1:59:03] what happens is that virus no longer has
[1:59:05] power that virus can no longer come
[1:59:07] after you and I want to say by
[1:59:09] experience by someone who was infected
[1:59:11] with that virus their whole entire life
[1:59:13] even after being saved I would say
[1:59:15] baptized filled with the Holy Ghost even
[1:59:17] after all of that still had that virus
[1:59:19] there came a time where I was able to be
[1:59:21] delivered from it though where my
[1:59:22] brother showed me that you don't have to
[1:59:24] live your life that way and you didn't
[1:59:25] even say it that way he just told me to
[1:59:27] shut your mouth I don't want to hear it
[1:59:28] but I walked away from there thinking
[1:59:30] wow what was that
[1:59:33] but I know what it was it was the Lord
[1:59:35] speaking to me giving me deliverance
[1:59:36] from that and we know brother Bradham he
[1:59:39] brings it out very clearly in Elisha's
[1:59:40] day he didn't go up with the prophet in
[1:59:42] his day he wasn't supposed to he was
[1:59:44] supposed to grab that mantle and go
[1:59:46] forwards with the message of the hour
[1:59:47] for his day and what happened brother
[1:59:49] Branham says it it was the dinner time
[1:59:51] conversations that the parents were
[1:59:53] having with their children where their
[1:59:55] children came out now and they mocked
[1:59:57] the prophet wasn't the parents it was a
[2:00:01] conversation that the parents had behind
[2:00:02] closed doors where nobody could hear and
[2:00:04] everything was safe and fine and what
[2:00:05] happened was those children went out and
[2:00:07] they lost their lives brothers and
[2:00:08] sisters that will happen spiritually
[2:00:09] speaking if we're not careful we've got
[2:00:12] to be careful with our families careful
[2:00:14] what we say around our children I say
[2:00:15] forgive me my children if I've said
[2:00:18] anything untowards things that maybe you
[2:00:20] shouldn't hear it's not healthy
[2:00:25] but I like in these little viruses today
[2:00:27] to be a little devil
[2:00:28] just waiting for the opportunity to
[2:00:30] spread to another host just looking for
[2:00:32] it just just begging for an opportunity
[2:00:34] to jump from one host to another looking
[2:00:37] for an opportunity because sometimes
[2:00:39] even if they do the one person might not
[2:00:41] be able to be infected but they can
[2:00:43] actually go from that person to the
[2:00:44] person the devil really wants them to
[2:00:46] get the one who is really vulnerable the
[2:00:48] one who actually will be able to be
[2:00:50] destroyed from it and that's how the
[2:00:53] devil works we can look at this and say
[2:00:55] brother Barry you're stretching it a
[2:00:56] little bit but you know the devil
[2:00:58] doesn't play fair
[2:00:59] he does not play according to the way we
[2:01:02] think we can play with fire a little bit
[2:01:04] in our lives and think that maybe a
[2:01:06] little Hollywood movie won't affect us
[2:01:08] or maybe a little bit of different music
[2:01:09] once in a while won't affect us I I know
[2:01:12] I I've I've been subject to it all
[2:01:15] I've lived in the world and I I've seen
[2:01:18] much way more than I ever wish that I
[2:01:20] would have but I know it was for a
[2:01:21] purpose brothers and sisters so I'm not
[2:01:23] naive standing here talking about this
[2:01:24] stuff we can deal with devils and not
[2:01:27] even recognize it in those situations
[2:01:29] but it can seem like it's a kind fine
[2:01:33] thing to bring into our home but what
[2:01:35] we're doing is we're polluting the minds
[2:01:37] and and The Souls of our very children
[2:01:39] by allowing these things in our homes
[2:01:41] into our lives
[2:01:45] the devil's just waiting for the
[2:01:47] opportunity to spread to another host
[2:01:50] why do you think that we have in the
[2:01:52] supermarkets they're still even there I
[2:01:53] was at Walmart a little while ago and I
[2:01:55] was shocked that they're still even
[2:01:56] there all of those stupid tabloid
[2:01:59] magazines
[2:02:00] talking about the royal family talking
[2:02:02] about this star and that musician and
[2:02:04] all this garbage they're good people I'm
[2:02:07] sure but why do they have that there
[2:02:09] because it's devils
[2:02:11] they're printing garbage to pollute our
[2:02:14] minds
[2:02:16] just waiting for the opportunity to
[2:02:18] spread to another host
[2:02:19] Devils travel in words and you know
[2:02:22] Jesus said that he that heareth my word
[2:02:24] how do we hear his word brothers and
[2:02:26] sisters by feeding on it we hear in our
[2:02:30] hearts
[2:02:31] but who has ears in their heart that's
[2:02:34] where we get into our innermost beings
[2:02:38] you know Matthew 12 it says either make
[2:02:40] the tree good and his fruit good or else
[2:02:43] make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[2:02:45] corrupt for the tree is known by his
[2:02:49] fruit
[2:02:50] oh Generation of Vipers how can you
[2:02:53] being evil speak good things
[2:02:56] for out of the abundance of the heart
[2:02:58] the mouth speaketh
[2:03:01] so you know brothers and sisters we have
[2:03:02] the ability to recognize it when
[2:03:04] someone's going through something in
[2:03:05] their life and maybe they are like I
[2:03:08] said
[2:03:09] Justified Sanctified filled with the
[2:03:12] Holy Ghost true blue Believers but they
[2:03:15] just get a little infected sometimes and
[2:03:18] sometimes they'll just get into a
[2:03:20] position where they forget who they are
[2:03:22] and and they'll start to really speak in
[2:03:24] a situation in a negative light and not
[2:03:27] really recognize that out of the
[2:03:29] abundance of their heart their mouth is
[2:03:31] now speaking and they're showing to
[2:03:33] another person what's going on inside of
[2:03:36] them
[2:03:37] and you know it works both ways we can
[2:03:39] see someone you get together with a
[2:03:41] Believer someone who's on fire for
[2:03:42] Christ and what is it a matter of
[2:03:43] seconds and you're talking about the
[2:03:45] word you're talking about the things of
[2:03:46] the Lord you're talking about what God's
[2:03:48] done for them in their life and all you
[2:03:49] can say is amen amen amen and did you
[2:03:52] hear this this is what the Lord's been
[2:03:53] saying to me and it just goes back and
[2:03:54] forth it goes both ways
[2:03:57] but we have the ability to stop it is
[2:03:59] what I'm saying when we get that
[2:04:00] negativity that negative spiritual virus
[2:04:03] that's knocking at our door trying to
[2:04:05] infect us we don't have to accept it we
[2:04:06] want to open the door to Christ we want
[2:04:08] to open the door to the word of God to
[2:04:10] come into our lives verse 35 says a good
[2:04:13] man out of the good Treasure of the
[2:04:15] heart bringeth forth good things an evil
[2:04:17] man out of the evil treasure bringeth
[2:04:20] forth evil things but I say unto you
[2:04:22] that Every Idle word that men shall
[2:04:26] speak they shall give account thereof on
[2:04:28] the day of judgment for by thy words
[2:04:31] Thou shalt be justified and by thy words
[2:04:34] Thou shalt be condemned
[2:04:37] I say Lord have mercy on me help me Lord
[2:04:41] I know that I have had evil words I know
[2:04:46] there's been things that I've said but
[2:04:48] you know
[2:04:48] I've gone and asked for forgiveness
[2:04:51] I've gone to people and said you know
[2:04:53] what I know that I've said stuff and
[2:04:55] that's it's not right
[2:04:56] and I just pray that you'll forgive me
[2:04:58] and they'll say you said what
[2:05:00] really I didn't even know I course I
[2:05:03] forgive you you know what if the spirit
[2:05:05] of God moves on one end brothers and
[2:05:07] sisters I promise you if that other
[2:05:08] person has the spirit of God they will
[2:05:10] receive you gladly and say hey don't
[2:05:12] even think about it it doesn't even
[2:05:14] affect me God bless you but you know
[2:05:16] what when they don't have the spirit of
[2:05:17] God when they're seriously infected with
[2:05:19] something they're going to be like yeah
[2:05:20] yeah I knew it and and and I don't know
[2:05:23] if I can get over it and and we'll see
[2:05:25] and maybe we'll just go and pray about
[2:05:26] it you know what we know people out of
[2:05:28] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[2:05:29] speaketh right
[2:05:31] Christ bowed his head and died for us
[2:05:34] and we can't forgive one another for a
[2:05:36] simple thing that's happened in our
[2:05:37] lives some things are complicated but we
[2:05:40] still have to forgive
[2:05:44] but I wanted to say this brothers and
[2:05:46] sisters I say unto you that Every Idle
[2:05:48] word that men shall speak
[2:05:51] sometimes we think that our words are
[2:05:52] just idle it doesn't matter we're just
[2:05:53] having a conversation it's not a big
[2:05:55] deal it's a quiet back room conversation
[2:05:57] about someone or something and
[2:05:59] is it affecting someone is it edifying
[2:06:01] the body
[2:06:02] or is it detracting from the body is it
[2:06:04] talking negative about the body
[2:06:05] sometimes it's not even about the body
[2:06:07] sometimes it's about a scoundrel in this
[2:06:09] world sometimes we're talking about
[2:06:10] someone who really is a bad person in
[2:06:12] this life but is that a positive
[2:06:13] conversation because Every Idle Word
[2:06:16] we're going to give account for
[2:06:17] and I would say
[2:06:19] the world we can look at that and say
[2:06:21] the world is going to give an account
[2:06:22] for Every Idle Word how much more the
[2:06:24] wife the living bride of Jesus Christ
[2:06:26] will she give account for Idle Words
[2:06:30] and as long as we're willing to look the
[2:06:32] Lord in the face and just come to him
[2:06:34] and and worship him and ask him to
[2:06:36] forgive us for our sins as long as we're
[2:06:38] willing to do like we did last week we
[2:06:39] showed that picture on the screen to
[2:06:41] have a daily death burial and
[2:06:44] Resurrection
[2:06:46] dying daily so long as we're willing to
[2:06:48] do that brothers and sisters we are not
[2:06:50] looking at judgment
[2:06:51] we're looking at Grace
[2:06:54] but when we don't actually do that when
[2:06:56] we don't humble ourselves in the sight
[2:06:58] of the Lord then we have a problem
[2:07:00] that's when we have an infection
[2:07:03] in Luke 6 it says for a good treat
[2:07:04] bringeth not forth corrupt fruit
[2:07:07] neither does a corrupt tree bring forth
[2:07:09] good fruit
[2:07:11] where every tree is known by its own
[2:07:13] fruit
[2:07:14] four of thorns men do not gather figs
[2:07:18] nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes
[2:07:20] a good man out of The Treasure of his
[2:07:22] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[2:07:24] an evil man out of the evil Treasure of
[2:07:27] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[2:07:29] evil for of the abundance of the heart
[2:07:32] the mouth speaketh
[2:07:34] and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not
[2:07:37] the things which I say whosoever cometh
[2:07:41] to me and heareth my sayings and doeth
[2:07:43] them I will show you to whom he is like
[2:07:48] he is like a man which built a house and
[2:07:50] dig deep and laid a foundation on a rock
[2:07:52] and when the flood arose the stream beat
[2:07:55] for him and Lee upon that house and
[2:07:57] could not shake it for it was founded
[2:07:59] upon a rock but he that heareth
[2:08:02] and doeth not
[2:08:04] It's Like a Man Without a foundation
[2:08:06] built a house upon the Earth against
[2:08:08] which the stream did beat vehemently and
[2:08:10] immediately it fell and the ruin of that
[2:08:13] house was great
[2:08:14] I Promise You Jesus was not speaking of
[2:08:17] construction
[2:08:19] he was not speaking of Renovations he
[2:08:21] wasn't speaking of masonry he wasn't
[2:08:23] speaking of carnal thinking he was
[2:08:25] speaking out of the abundance of the
[2:08:27] heart the mouth speaketh and unless
[2:08:29] we're willing to build our foundation
[2:08:31] spiritually upon the solid rock of the
[2:08:34] revelation of the word for our day
[2:08:36] then you know what's going to happen the
[2:08:38] enemy is going to come in like a flood
[2:08:39] brothers and sisters and how is he going
[2:08:41] to come in like a flood he's not going
[2:08:42] to come in like a flood like we think
[2:08:43] he's not going to have a river like in
[2:08:44] 2013 it's going to overflow the banks
[2:08:47] and flood everything and everything will
[2:08:49] be floating it's not going to be like
[2:08:50] that at all it's going to be out of the
[2:08:52] abundance of the heart the mouth is
[2:08:53] going to be speaking to us trying to
[2:08:55] corrupt us trying to get us to behave
[2:08:57] improperly as believers
[2:09:00] sometimes it happens we do as Believers
[2:09:03] but we just need to ask the Lord to
[2:09:04] forgive us and we know that the Lord
[2:09:06] said you know what you haven't wronged
[2:09:08] me
[2:09:09] you've made it right with me but just
[2:09:11] leave here oh I'm here and go on make it
[2:09:13] right with your brother your sister and
[2:09:15] then come back and worship me but if
[2:09:18] we're not willing to go and make it
[2:09:19] right with our brother and our sister he
[2:09:20] might not even receive our worship
[2:09:23] that's pretty shocking but it's true
[2:09:25] James 4 17 therefore to him that knoweth
[2:09:29] to do good and doeth it not to him it is
[2:09:31] sin
[2:09:33] we want to make sure that we're not
[2:09:34] sinning today
[2:09:36] if we have
[2:09:38] a brush with a spiritual virus brothers
[2:09:40] and sisters
[2:09:41] it's a negative word
[2:09:43] brush it off
[2:09:44] brush it off in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:09:47] don't worry about trying to rebuke your
[2:09:49] brother or your sister and say get thee
[2:09:50] behind me Satan don't do that
[2:09:53] just simply kindly in love tell them I I
[2:09:57] don't want to talk about that because I
[2:10:00] know it's not going to edify me and it's
[2:10:02] not edifying you and it's certainly not
[2:10:04] edifying Christ
[2:10:06] so let's talk about the good things
[2:10:09] and you know I want to talk about it
[2:10:10] from a different aspect now we've really
[2:10:12] harped on the the fact that we can
[2:10:14] destroy a person's character if we see a
[2:10:17] situation that acts funny and we just
[2:10:19] don't know how to deal with it you know
[2:10:20] you can change that situation without
[2:10:22] actually going and physically changing
[2:10:24] the person you can start to actually use
[2:10:27] the third pull to your advantage
[2:10:28] brothers and sisters now this might
[2:10:30] sound like manipulation but I can tell
[2:10:32] you by by experience it changes
[2:10:34] everything
[2:10:37] you start to speak positive about that
[2:10:39] brother or that sister
[2:10:41] you start to speak positive about that
[2:10:43] brother or that sister and just see if
[2:10:45] things don't change it's not going to be
[2:10:47] instantaneous don't do that don't think
[2:10:48] it's going to be a great miracle because
[2:10:49] it's a third pole no no no
[2:10:51] no no give it weeks months years even
[2:10:53] but watch God change it
[2:10:57] all creation has to obey you if you're
[2:10:59] in line with the word of God because
[2:11:00] when you're in line with the word of God
[2:11:02] brothers and sisters it's not you
[2:11:03] speaking
[2:11:05] it's deity speaking
[2:11:09] you want to see a brother or a sister
[2:11:10] change start speaking positive about
[2:11:12] them
[2:11:14] if you've got a situation with a spouse
[2:11:16] you just don't know how to deal with it
[2:11:18] stop speaking negative about them don't
[2:11:20] joke about them there's no jokes in
[2:11:22] marriage brothers and sisters joking
[2:11:24] about your spouse is the is the
[2:11:26] direction that's the direction the arrow
[2:11:28] sign for a bad marriage
[2:11:31] don't joke about a spouse don't joke
[2:11:34] about the person that you claim to love
[2:11:36] think about God does he joke about us as
[2:11:38] a husband he doesn't joke about us he
[2:11:40] takes his bride very seriously very very
[2:11:43] seriously and every word that he says in
[2:11:45] the word is all positive about his bride
[2:11:48] isn't it
[2:11:49] how could we speak negative about our
[2:11:51] bride and think that we're going to get
[2:11:52] by with that joking to friends we're
[2:11:54] just joking you know what jokes go a
[2:11:57] long ways towards the negative side
[2:11:58] don't joke about your marriage brothers
[2:12:00] and sisters but Joshua we know going
[2:12:03] back in the scripture here he was
[2:12:05] instructed to cross over Jordan and when
[2:12:07] they got over to where they were
[2:12:09] supposed to go they were supposed to
[2:12:10] destroy everything I didn't even really
[2:12:12] get into what I wanted to today maybe we
[2:12:14] can quickly turn to the Book of Joshua
[2:12:18] Joshua
[2:12:21] chapter 6.
[2:12:25] talking about the importance of our
[2:12:27] words and the importance of our voice
[2:12:31] what is it that brought down the walls
[2:12:34] of Jericho brothers and sisters
[2:12:38] we can say that it was trumpets and it
[2:12:39] was the word of God and we know that it
[2:12:41] was both
[2:12:43] it was angels that came it was an
[2:12:45] earthquake that happened
[2:12:47] but the children of Israel followed the
[2:12:48] instruction that was given to them
[2:12:52] we'll just read verse 5 of Joshua
[2:12:55] chapter 6 and it came to pass that when
[2:12:57] they made a long blast with the Ram's
[2:13:00] Horn and when ye hear the sound of the
[2:13:02] trumpet all the people shall Shout with
[2:13:06] a great shout and the wall of the city
[2:13:09] shall fall down flat and the people
[2:13:11] shall Ascend up every man straight
[2:13:14] before him jump down to verse 10 and
[2:13:18] Joshua commanded the people saying ye
[2:13:20] shall not shout nor make any noise with
[2:13:24] your voice neither shall any word
[2:13:27] proceed out of your mouth
[2:13:30] until the day I bid you to shout
[2:13:34] then
[2:13:35] shall ye Shout
[2:13:37] to think about the importance of the
[2:13:39] voice of the children of Israel
[2:13:41] no Idol banter while they're walking
[2:13:43] around while they're marching around
[2:13:45] following the instructions of the the
[2:13:47] Lord of hosts that gave to Joshua they
[2:13:49] were given a very specific instruction
[2:13:51] brothers and sisters to see their
[2:13:53] enemies defeat to get those walls to
[2:13:56] crash down it was
[2:13:58] follow my word to the letter and see
[2:14:01] what will happen and don't talk about it
[2:14:04] just keep your lips closed and when the
[2:14:08] time is right you have the ability to
[2:14:11] shout
[2:14:12] and we know they walked around the city
[2:14:14] seven times we know the story for the
[2:14:16] sake of time let's drop down to verse 16
[2:14:18] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[2:14:21] when the priest blew the trumpets Joshua
[2:14:24] said unto the people shout for the Lord
[2:14:26] hath given you the city and the city
[2:14:29] shall be accursed even it and all they
[2:14:32] that are in therein to the Lord only
[2:14:34] Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all
[2:14:37] that are with her in the house because
[2:14:39] she did she hid The Messengers that was
[2:14:42] we sent and ye in any wise keep
[2:14:45] yourselves from the accursed thing lest
[2:14:47] you make yourselves a cursed
[2:14:49] when you take of the accursed thing and
[2:14:52] make the camp of Israel a curse and
[2:14:54] trouble it
[2:14:55] and now we say but all the silver and
[2:14:57] the gold and the vessels of brass and
[2:14:58] iron are consecrated unto the Lord they
[2:15:01] shall come into the treasury of the Lord
[2:15:05] so the people shouted when the priest
[2:15:07] blew the trumpet and it came to pass
[2:15:09] when the people heard the sound of the
[2:15:11] trumpet and the people shouted with the
[2:15:14] great shout that the wall fell down flat
[2:15:18] so that the people went into the city
[2:15:21] every man straight before him and they
[2:15:24] took the city and they utterly destroyed
[2:15:26] all that was in the city both man and
[2:15:29] woman young and old ox and sheep and ass
[2:15:31] with the edge of the sword
[2:15:35] s and sisters today I want to say
[2:15:38] that if we get a discussion if we get a
[2:15:40] spiritual virus knocking at our door
[2:15:42] Sometimes they come in different forms
[2:15:44] I've talked today just about the speech
[2:15:46] and how we can talk negative about
[2:15:48] someone Sometimes they come in different
[2:15:50] forms Sometimes they come in form of
[2:15:52] Doubt to say that you know is God's eyes
[2:15:54] really upon me we said that earlier
[2:15:56] according to the scripture in Ezekiel or
[2:15:58] God's eyes really upon the people of the
[2:16:01] city does he really know the situation
[2:16:03] that I'm in we can have doubt in our
[2:16:05] hearts and we know that doubt and faith
[2:16:08] cannot live together fear and faith will
[2:16:10] not coexist there's only one thing that
[2:16:12] can exist in the heart of a True
[2:16:14] Believer and that's faith and that's not
[2:16:16] even our faith that's God's own faith it
[2:16:18] has to be his Spirit living out through
[2:16:19] us but when we get to that place
[2:16:21] brothers and sisters when we see the
[2:16:23] negative things coming around when we
[2:16:25] can see doubt when we can see fear when
[2:16:28] we can see all of these different
[2:16:29] spiritual viruses that want to cling to
[2:16:32] us they want to get in us and infect us
[2:16:34] and cause us to affect other people we
[2:16:37] know that the children of Israel when
[2:16:38] they were over there what happened
[2:16:40] 12. Valiant men went over to spy the
[2:16:43] land but only two of them had the
[2:16:45] ability to not get infected with a
[2:16:48] spiritual virus but what happened the
[2:16:49] other 10 went back and affected just
[2:16:52] about 2 million people
[2:16:55] and what was it that they infected the
[2:16:57] people with they didn't just go and rub
[2:16:58] shoulders and affect them and say that
[2:17:00] now you've got the amalekite sickness
[2:17:01] and you've got the the Giant's illness
[2:17:04] it wasn't any of that it was their words
[2:17:06] it was their words of Doubt to say that
[2:17:08] no it's not God's will for this
[2:17:10] congregation to go this way or it's not
[2:17:13] God's will for us to go and take the
[2:17:14] land because we're we're grasshoppers in
[2:17:17] the sight of them how do they know what
[2:17:19] the enemy saw them as
[2:17:21] we know that Joshua despise actually
[2:17:24] said what the enemy saw them as the
[2:17:26] enemy said that our hearts melt within
[2:17:28] us when we see you coming
[2:17:30] because when you come we know that you
[2:17:32] have the Living God on your side
[2:17:36] but you know brothers and sisters I just
[2:17:37] want to say it this way when we come to
[2:17:39] the house of the Lord we have the
[2:17:40] opportunity I want to say it this way if
[2:17:43] I could substitute myself for Joshua I
[2:17:46] want to say when you come to the house
[2:17:47] of the Lord Shout to the Lord don't hold
[2:17:50] back brothers and sisters this is your
[2:17:52] place this is your time to see the walls
[2:17:55] of the enemy come down flat if you want
[2:17:58] to see the spiritual viruses fall away
[2:18:00] and get pushed back this is your place
[2:18:03] this is your time we don't know how many
[2:18:06] more times we'll be able to gather
[2:18:08] together like this brothers and sisters
[2:18:09] one of these days they're going to close
[2:18:11] the doors primarily and one of these
[2:18:12] days they could say oh there's a new
[2:18:13] strain of the virus and now it's
[2:18:15] overtaking the whole world and they're
[2:18:16] going to close it up are we going to go
[2:18:18] and Stream in our homes again
[2:18:20] Lord have mercy I hope not
[2:18:23] but you know there came a time when by
[2:18:25] when when the pandemic struck this was
[2:18:27] the last service we had a time where we
[2:18:29] didn't come together again for how long
[2:18:32] just about two years
[2:18:35] I think it's amazing that we're able to
[2:18:37] gather together this way
[2:18:39] one of these times they might come
[2:18:40] around and say you know what you're a
[2:18:42] part of that cult
[2:18:44] you're not going to have your doors open
[2:18:45] we will not allow you to gather
[2:18:48] and worship under the name of William
[2:18:51] Miriam Branham then what are we going to
[2:18:53] do
[2:18:54] that's when I would say all that can be
[2:18:56] shaken will be shaken
[2:18:58] what about the Believers that just
[2:19:00] barely get enough strength just barely
[2:19:02] get enough of a booster charge in their
[2:19:05] batteries to just barely make it to
[2:19:07] another service
[2:19:08] what about those Believers what will
[2:19:11] they do if we can't come to service
[2:19:13] brothers and sisters
[2:19:14] but then there's some they're just
[2:19:16] supercharged
[2:19:18] they've always got it plugged in they're
[2:19:19] always getting charged they've got solar
[2:19:21] panels and what happens is they're
[2:19:23] always generating electricity they're
[2:19:24] always getting that Dynamic Powers
[2:19:26] always in them because they just are
[2:19:29] right that's the life of a Believer
[2:19:30] sometimes we get a little bit down but
[2:19:32] brothers and sisters we don't want to be
[2:19:34] that person who is just barely making it
[2:19:36] getting getting polluted with the things
[2:19:39] of this world our minds have the ability
[2:19:41] to be polluted and Satan has some
[2:19:44] creative cunning devices to pollute our
[2:19:46] minds nothing better than the screens
[2:19:49] that we see nothing better than the
[2:19:51] social media that we allow ourselves to
[2:19:53] view I'm guilty of it nothing more
[2:19:56] cunning than than the stuff that that he
[2:19:59] gives us in this day
[2:20:02] but I just want to say it brothers and
[2:20:03] sisters we have the ability and you will
[2:20:05] never hear me say you're getting too
[2:20:07] noisy you're getting a little out of
[2:20:08] hand over there I'm going to say Amen
[2:20:11] you know what I want to do a Victory lap
[2:20:13] with you if you want to take one go for
[2:20:15] it if you want to do a somersault go for
[2:20:17] it if you want to jump out of your seat
[2:20:18] and scream praise the Lord go ahead and
[2:20:21] do it there isn't going to be any put
[2:20:23] offs with that here some people might
[2:20:25] get a little uncomfortable but you know
[2:20:26] what brothers and sisters if you have
[2:20:27] the desire to do that that might help
[2:20:28] other people to break out of their
[2:20:30] shells and say Amen you know what I know
[2:20:33] that I know that I know it doesn't
[2:20:35] matter whether I live or die I'm Christ
[2:20:38] and we have reason to Rejoice over that
[2:20:43] we know that Moses was instructed with
[2:20:45] uh with the signs he was given the
[2:20:47] plagues to go and infect the land and
[2:20:50] said let my people go and he told them
[2:20:52] who should I tell them I stutter I can't
[2:20:54] speak well who should I tell him sent me
[2:20:57] when he saw the burning bush and Jesus
[2:20:59] God in the bush said I am said I am you
[2:21:03] tell them that I am said I am that's the
[2:21:05] one I am has sent you and all the signs
[2:21:10] and wonders that he went and did they
[2:21:11] still wouldn't believe
[2:21:12] is it interesting to think about when we
[2:21:15] talk about the Rich Young Ruler signs
[2:21:17] and wonders brothers and sisters they're
[2:21:18] not going to do nothing for people if
[2:21:21] they don't believe if they're infected
[2:21:23] with a spiritual virus they could see
[2:21:24] someone come back from the dead and it
[2:21:27] won't change who they are
[2:21:28] that's what Abraham told Lazarus in hell
[2:21:31] when Lazarus said send send someone send
[2:21:34] Lazarus back to tell my brothers warn
[2:21:36] them that they won't come to this place
[2:21:38] of suffering and he said you know what
[2:21:40] if they won't hear the voice of a
[2:21:41] prophet they're not going to hear a dead
[2:21:42] man are you crazy
[2:21:46] but in Moses day he was given a final
[2:21:49] sign
[2:21:51] maybe I'll call the musicians as we
[2:21:53] close up here Moses was given a final
[2:21:55] sign
[2:21:57] and that sign was the plague of death
[2:21:59] and there was only one way that they
[2:22:01] could actually
[2:22:03] not fall victim to that plague of death
[2:22:06] there was only one way that they would
[2:22:07] not be affected by Death in their houses
[2:22:10] and that was to Simply take the word of
[2:22:14] the Vindicated prophet in their day and
[2:22:16] apply it to their homes and apply it to
[2:22:19] their lives and we know that that word
[2:22:21] in that day many times we just brush
[2:22:23] over it I think it's just good to stir
[2:22:25] up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance
[2:22:27] think about it today brothers and
[2:22:28] sisters if you were to take blood and
[2:22:30] splatter it to the doorpost of your
[2:22:33] house
[2:22:34] and splatter it to the lintel over top
[2:22:36] of your door
[2:22:38] in the warmer temperatures we'd have
[2:22:40] flies buzzing around our houses the
[2:22:41] neighbors would all say you're crazy
[2:22:43] listen to those people they're they're
[2:22:45] part of that cult they've got something
[2:22:47] funny in their lives they're gonna have
[2:22:50] some sort of a doomsday cult thing going
[2:22:52] on look at them they've got blood
[2:22:54] splattered on their house why would they
[2:22:56] do that because the prophet of God said
[2:22:58] to do it and you know us in our lives
[2:23:00] brothers and sisters the devil said take
[2:23:02] the TV and kick it out of your house the
[2:23:04] devil said or brother Branham said take
[2:23:07] the TV and kick it out of your house
[2:23:08] that was God speaking to mankind that
[2:23:12] wasn't just a man saying those things we
[2:23:14] have been given the ability to overcome
[2:23:16] all of this stuff in our lives if
[2:23:18] there's something dragging us down
[2:23:19] brothers and sisters you know God will
[2:23:21] tell you and if you don't know and you
[2:23:23] want more success in your lives with God
[2:23:25] just ask him and he'll show you and when
[2:23:28] he does show you just follow the word
[2:23:29] just follow him I say it myself Lord
[2:23:32] help me I told you I had to battle with
[2:23:34] Facebook and you know what I found
[2:23:35] brothers and sisters this is how cunning
[2:23:37] the devil is I was really into music for
[2:23:40] a time and what happened I said it
[2:23:42] before probably but I'll say it again
[2:23:43] somehow I don't know how I didn't have
[2:23:46] Facebook until I was a Believer until I
[2:23:48] threw away all my CDs until I threw away
[2:23:51] all of my music accounts all of the
[2:23:53] stuff that I had somehow Facebook
[2:23:56] started to feed me the music that I used
[2:23:58] to love once upon a time
[2:24:00] feeding me feeding me feeding me and and
[2:24:03] as a silly child I would look at it and
[2:24:07] be saying oh I remember that
[2:24:10] I remember that song too
[2:24:13] and I know that one too and it started
[2:24:16] to become familiar and it started to
[2:24:18] come back and come back and you know
[2:24:19] what the Lord told me forget about it
[2:24:21] just get rid of it it's polluting your
[2:24:23] mind
[2:24:25] the devil wants to pollute our minds he
[2:24:27] just wants to distract us and you know
[2:24:29] what will happen when he distracts us
[2:24:30] it's not going to be the distraction
[2:24:31] necessarily that kills us it's going to
[2:24:33] be a distraction that allows a spiritual
[2:24:35] virus to get in and when that virus gets
[2:24:38] in brothers and sisters it's pretty
[2:24:39] tough to get it out but you know what we
[2:24:41] can get it out but we're going to go a
[2:24:43] long ways the wrong way if we let our
[2:24:45] guard down too far and think about it as
[2:24:47] parents in the home if we let down the
[2:24:49] guard in our home and we allow a
[2:24:51] spiritual virus to get in our children
[2:24:52] our children might not serve the Lord as
[2:24:56] long as we can see it and you know what
[2:24:58] doesn't mean they're lost but we might
[2:25:00] not see it with our own eyes
[2:25:02] doesn't matter though because we can't
[2:25:04] stop that quickening power and if we do
[2:25:06] what our dear brother and sister did
[2:25:08] today with our children we just commit
[2:25:10] them back to God because we know that we
[2:25:11] can't do it it's got to be God that does
[2:25:13] it he'll do it brothers and sisters if
[2:25:16] Rahab the Harlot could have her family
[2:25:18] saved I want to tell you today you can
[2:25:20] have your family safe commit them to God
[2:25:22] trust him brother Branham says it just
[2:25:24] keep holding them before the Throne of
[2:25:26] God your children and they will not be
[2:25:28] lost
[2:25:29] maybe stand with me this morning you
[2:25:31] know we just need to be like Moses he
[2:25:33] gave the instruction to apply the token
[2:25:35] in our lives if we're willing to apply
[2:25:36] the token in our lives we're not going
[2:25:38] to be misled by anyone that wants to try
[2:25:40] and and be caught up with a spiritual
[2:25:42] virus we're not going to be caught up in
[2:25:44] conversations we're not going to be
[2:25:45] deceived as the Bride of Jesus Christ as
[2:25:48] the feminine we know that once upon a
[2:25:50] time the feminine was pulled out of the
[2:25:53] husband and when she was
[2:25:55] there she was able to be tempted she was
[2:25:57] able to be deceived
[2:26:00] but this bride today will never be able
[2:26:02] to be deceived never the bride in
[2:26:05] Satan's Eden will not be just herself
[2:26:08] she will be him and that's the mystery
[2:26:09] that Paul spoke about back in in
[2:26:11] Ephesians what a tremendous thought it
[2:26:14] is brothers and sisters I just want to
[2:26:15] encourage us today if we have any
[2:26:18] situation any occasion where someone
[2:26:19] wants to smack talk just shut it down
[2:26:22] shut it down the sad I want to hear
[2:26:24] because it's just going to make me sick
[2:26:26] and I don't want that God bless you
[2:26:28] today let's pray gracious Heavenly
[2:26:31] Father Lord I pray that you would just
[2:26:33] continue watching over us father as we
[2:26:35] go our separate ways today we thank you
[2:26:37] for your word Lord
[2:26:39] father we thank you that we have been
[2:26:41] given the ability to discern the spirits
[2:26:43] father we know the only way that we can
[2:26:46] do that is through your spirit living
[2:26:48] out through us
[2:26:50] father I know that not one of your
[2:26:52] children wants to have a sickness not
[2:26:55] one of us wants to have a spiritual
[2:26:57] virus Lord and many times we can be
[2:27:00] caught up with them but father I want to
[2:27:02] thank you for the delivering power of
[2:27:04] your word of your Dynamic life that can
[2:27:08] come down and speak to a brother or a
[2:27:10] sister and and be delivering
[2:27:13] to them Father
[2:27:16] we have the ability to hide a multitude
[2:27:18] of sin and father I pray that we could
[2:27:21] do that one for another I pray that we
[2:27:23] could be encouraging one to another I
[2:27:25] pray that we could speak good things
[2:27:27] about one another I pray that we would
[2:27:29] be encouraging about one another's
[2:27:30] children father I pray that Lord Jesus
[2:27:33] we would hold the token not just over
[2:27:35] our own home but that we would hold the
[2:27:37] token over each other's children in the
[2:27:39] body Lord that we would hold the token
[2:27:41] over our brothers and sisters that we
[2:27:43] can see they need help in their lives
[2:27:45] father Lord that we wouldn't put anyone
[2:27:47] out or bring anyone in we would allow
[2:27:50] you to do it and we would just stand in
[2:27:52] our positions as your wife Lord
[2:27:54] father just allowing you to move in the
[2:27:57] situations of Our Lives
[2:27:59] father we just want to rebuke Satan in
[2:28:01] the name of Jesus Christ if he has come
[2:28:04] into any one of our Lives Lord to any
[2:28:06] one of our families Lord Jesus to any
[2:28:09] one of our children's lives Lord we just
[2:28:11] want to commit them to you father we
[2:28:13] just ask that you would wash away that
[2:28:16] virus Lord Jesus and allow us to apply
[2:28:19] the token quickly father Lord that that
[2:28:21] that house wouldn't be swept out and
[2:28:23] garnished just waiting for him to come
[2:28:26] back with seven other friends worse than
[2:28:28] the one before father that we could just
[2:28:30] see the Deliverance in our children
[2:28:32] father
[2:28:34] we have the ability to apply the token
[2:28:36] and father we just Lord we want to take
[2:28:39] that opportunity and do it father Lord
[2:28:42] we ask that you would be with those who
[2:28:43] weren't here today that you would just
[2:28:45] be with them Father whether they're
[2:28:46] traveling Lord whether they're sick
[2:28:48] father each one of us needs a touch from
[2:28:51] you every single day of our lives and I
[2:28:53] pray Lord that we would be able to have
[2:28:55] that death burial and Resurrection
[2:28:57] experience father that we would die out
[2:28:59] to ourselves so that you could live
[2:29:01] through US father that Lord one of these
[2:29:04] days we know somewhere between six and
[2:29:06] nine in the morning Father everything is
[2:29:09] going to change Lord I pray that we
[2:29:11] would just be able to apply the token
[2:29:13] and go forwards with confidence knowing
[2:29:16] that we will not miss that day neither
[2:29:18] will our families father we love you and
[2:29:21] we thank you we ask that you would just
[2:29:23] be with us and now as we go our separate
