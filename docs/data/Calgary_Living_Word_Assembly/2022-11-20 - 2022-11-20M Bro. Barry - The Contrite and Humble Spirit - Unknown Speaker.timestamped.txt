[27:17] that you've given to us to assemble in
[27:20] your name
[27:21] oh Father last night we were reading
[27:23] about something where your prophet
[27:26] was saying that
[27:28] as a child

[27:33] cloth on them a coat
[27:36] the child cannot even lift up the hands
[27:38] well
[27:39] they cannot do it themselves it falls
[27:42] back it falls down this way that way
[27:45] and this is what the prophet said if we
[27:47] can yield to you to put on the clothes
[27:52] sometimes
[27:54] we forget that you are the only one that
[27:56] can dress us in your word we try to go
[28:00] the other way but this morning Father

[28:09] coming Upon Us in this time this age we
[28:13] have we cannot do anything about it the
[28:15] only thing that we can do is to
[28:17] surrender to you
[28:19] is to feed upon this word because it's
[28:22] upon this word that we can withstand
[28:24] whatever is coming
[28:26] no president no economy can change what
[28:30] is coming we better get into the boat
[28:33] it's getting too late as the prophet
[28:35] said this morning Father we want to put
[28:37] away
[28:40] the things that we think we can do by
[28:42] ourselves
[28:43] by looking at one another
[28:45] but to look up to you Jesus this morning
[28:48] help us to raise up our eyes and look up
[28:52] to only you not even one person on in
[28:55] the same Pew with us Lord but look up to
[28:58] you this morning once again father we

[29:03] word is still alive Your Grace is still
[29:07] alive and this morning we are here to
[29:10] rejoice in what you are done father now

[29:17] may you prepare place in our hearts to
[29:20] receive the word
[29:21] Lord Jesus as brother Paul is leading us
[29:24] through songs Lord may we forget about
[29:26] what we are going to do after service
[29:29] and put in

[37:24] report
[37:25] if you have a request this morning just
[37:27] maybe make it known unto him with an
[37:28] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer
[37:31] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[37:34] thank you this
[37:35] this morning Lord Jesus for another
[37:37] opportunity to come and feast at your
[37:40] table

[37:44] prepared than we could possibly manage
[37:47] father and this morning we just ask
[37:49] father that you would just allow us to
[37:51] help ourselves to apportion father that
[37:54] we need a portion that will satisfy us
[37:57] father individually father we know that
[38:00] you deal with Israel as a nation but you
[38:02] deal with the Gentiles as an individual
[38:04] so father this morning Lord Jesus let it
[38:06] be all about me father let it be all
[38:10] about my brother and my sister today
[38:11] Father we pray that you would just touch
[38:14] each one father we know that you're
[38:16] already here so we're not going to
[38:17] invite you here we're going to welcome

[38:24] being accountable to your word Lord we
[38:26] know that heavens and earth will pass
[38:28] away we know that we can't even take
[38:29] many times our brother or our sister's
[38:31] words father but Lord Jesus when you
[38:34] speak when we read your word we know
[38:36] that you will always back your word
[38:38] father and we thank you for that today
[38:40] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[38:43] that said Lord Jesus by your stripes we
[38:46] are healed and father we thank you that
[38:48] we can claim that word Lord Jesus as our
[38:51] present tense I am for brother Aiden
[38:53] livsy right now Lord Jesus father we
[38:55] pray that you would just raise him up
[38:57] Lord Jesus even in his own home father
[38:59] that he would just begin a little
[39:01] Revival in his own heart father in his
[39:04] own home Lord Jesus
[39:05] father we know that you can do that we
[39:08] know that you can bring a Revival here
[39:09] today Father and Lord Jesus I pray for
[39:12] each hand that was made known unto you
[39:14] with a request father that you would
[39:16] just bless them Lord that you would just
[39:18] Lord honor the faith of that individual
[39:20] Lord Jesus father I pray sovereignly for
[39:23] this church today Lord Jesus that you
[39:25] would grant us a little Revival here at
[39:28] Calgary Living Word father we know the
[39:30] great revivals are over lord Jesus but
[39:32] your Prophet said the bride's Revival is
[39:34] burning ever strong Lord Jesus that's
[39:37] not something that's ever going to go
[39:38] out we're going to take that Revival
[39:40] with us all the way across Jordan into
[39:43] eternity father for a millennium as you
[39:45] parade us in front of Satan Lord Jesus
[39:48] to show that you have taken a bride that
[39:50] will not be moved from your word Lord
[39:52] Jesus father this morning we pray that
[39:55] you would just be glorified in all
[39:56] that's said and done father we thank you
[39:59] for another opportunity to meet with you
[40:01] we just ask all these things now in
[40:04] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[40:06] amen
[40:08] amen hallelujah
[40:10] oh my
[40:15] thank you musicians this morning
[40:19] you have your Bibles I just want to take
[40:21] a little bit of a different direction
[40:23] I want to turn to Isaiah 57 this morning
[40:27] Isaiah 57
[40:30] certainly thankful for the leadership of
[40:32] the Lord
[40:34] many times I wonder where to go and and
[40:36] what to do what should we talk about
[40:38] Lord
[40:39] what should we
[40:41] oh my try and bring
[40:45] and it's in the wee hours of the day
[40:47] that he comes by
[40:49] and he shows us very clearly and then he
[40:52] backs it up
[40:53] with the Vindication and song A
[40:56] Vindication in word my my my
[41:00] Isaiah 57
[41:03] verse 13.
[41:08] when thou cryest let thy companies
[41:11] deliver thee
[41:13] but the wind shall carry them all away
[41:17] vanity shall take them
[41:19] but he that putteth his trust in me
[41:21] shall possess the land
[41:24] and shall inherit my Holy Mountain
[41:28] and shall say cast ye up cast ye up
[41:31] prepare the way
[41:33] take up the stumbling block out of the
[41:35] way of my people
[41:38] for thus saith the high and lofty one
[41:40] that inhabiteth eternity whose name is
[41:44] Holy
[41:45] I dwell in the high and holy place and
[41:49] with him also that is of a contrite and
[41:53] humble spirit
[41:55] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[41:58] to revive the heart of the contrite ones
[42:02] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[42:06] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[42:08] thank you for your word
[42:10] we thank you for your goodness to us
[42:12] Lord
[42:13] and we thank you Father that you have
[42:15] shown us very clearly who will abide
[42:18] with you in your Holy Mountain
[42:22] we know that you resist the proud father
[42:24] oh Lord Jesus but you raise up the
[42:27] humble father and this morning we just
[42:30] ask father that you could just raise us
[42:31] up Lord
[42:33] father that we could just push aside any
[42:35] thoughts or any reasoning father that we
[42:38] could just take every thought into
[42:39] captivity father Lord Jesus that we
[42:42] could just tear down strongholds father
[42:44] and just allow you Lord Jesus to revive
[42:47] the fire in the hearts of your children
[42:49] this morning Father Lord Jesus and I
[42:52] pray don't leave mine out Lord father
[42:54] allow me to have a Revival as well
[42:56] father Lord Jesus we all long for that
[42:59] and we just ask that today you would be
[43:01] glorified in all that said and done Lord
[43:03] Jesus help the speaker to get out of the
[43:06] way let me get out of the way Lord Jesus
[43:07] and just give you the the full
[43:09] preeminence that you desire Lord Jesus
[43:11] and I pray that you would just speak to
[43:13] each one father as you see fit we just
[43:16] ask all these things now in Jesus
[43:19] Christ's name we pray
[43:20] amen amen God bless you this morning you
[43:23] may be seated
[43:27] certainly excited about today
[43:34] I want to talk about being contrite
[43:36] today
[43:38] that's the word that came to me at about
[43:40] four o'clock this morning
[43:42] contrite
[43:45] being contrite that's the ones who are
[43:47] going to inhabit that Holy Mountain
[43:50] would you mind just turning down the
[43:52] monitors a little bit brother
[43:56] a
[43:58] just want to remind everyone as well if
[44:00] you're tuning in when I ask to turn down
[44:02] the monitors it's not turning down the
[44:03] sound to anybody it's just turning down
[44:06] the speakers that are on the stage here
[44:07] I had a question about that this week
[44:09] and just don't get nervous if I say that
[44:12] it's only the sound right here
[44:15] are you happy today
[44:17] is like today it makes me nervous I feel
[44:20] really nervous it's really strange how
[44:22] it works because I know the Lord's here
[44:24] I know that he's leading this and he's
[44:27] leading us and we certainly want to just
[44:29] be in service for him
[44:31] just want to welcome everyone and trust
[44:33] that you feel well today
[44:36] certainly excited because today is a
[44:38] real special day
[44:40] one of a few days that we see
[44:43] in our lives and this is the day where
[44:46] sister Jewel and sister Joanna and
[44:49] sister Victoria olaji are going to
[44:52] change their lives forever in a watery
[44:54] grave
[44:55] they're going to get baptized
[45:02] the Lord has revealed to them that it's
[45:05] up to them to make that step forward and
[45:07] I sure appreciate a parent's perspective
[45:09] on that that doesn't thrust their
[45:11] children forward to do something that's
[45:14] not been revealed to them
[45:16] but allows the Lord to reveal it because
[45:18] when that happens then it becomes their
[45:20] very own revelation
[45:22] and when they drive down that stake and
[45:24] and go forwards by Revelation they can
[45:27] always look back to that time
[45:29] we know that if someone can be talked
[45:31] into something then they can be talked
[45:33] out of it
[45:33] but when it becomes a revelation brother
[45:36] Branham said that's a free gift from God
[45:37] directly from God to the individual the
[45:40] ability to hear from him and then to act
[45:42] on it so we're certainly excited we're
[45:44] going to have a baptism after service
[45:46] today we have a communion service
[45:48] tonight it's just going to be a church
[45:50] day today we're certainly excited about
[45:53] that we've got the youth banquet coming
[45:55] up on Saturday it's posted on the youth
[45:57] chat if anybody has any questions please
[45:59] reach out to us
[46:01] um brother Toby is going to take the the
[46:03] meeting and I trust the Lord has put
[46:05] something on his heart for the Youth
[46:07] some words of encouragement words that
[46:10] will help them
[46:11] we know that we can come up with many
[46:13] different uh many different things in
[46:15] our own thinking and we can even get
[46:17] into the psychological Realms and and
[46:20] encourage people but nothing encourages
[46:22] a son or a daughter of God like the word
[46:24] of God does
[46:27] I just wanted to also inform everyone
[46:29] that uh this might be the last service
[46:33] that we see sister Rosie here with us
[46:36] her plane ticket has been sort of
[46:38] bounced around and it sounds like she
[46:40] might be going back either right away or
[46:42] on the first of December as I understand
[46:44] so if you get an opportunity please
[46:47] Shake sister Rosie's hand it's been a
[46:49] wonderful opportunity to fellowship with
[46:50] you sister it's wonderful when you
[46:53] Minister when you song Lead when you're
[46:54] at the pulpit here and you see someone
[46:57] who is a Believer because they're always
[46:59] engaged and they're just happy they just
[47:01] they just draw it's wonderful and that's
[47:04] that's that's how I would describe
[47:05] sister Rosie just a believer that draws
[47:08] draws the word out of me it's wonderful
[47:11] I have her phone number if you would
[47:13] like to keep in touch with her via
[47:15] WhatsApp we can certainly uh pass that
[47:17] along and I fully intend to keep in
[47:19] touch with sister Rosie there's a
[47:21] brother that's reached out to me from
[47:23] India and maybe Lord willing I told
[47:25] sister Rosie we'll come and visit her
[47:27] there one day we know that brother Wayne
[47:29] is quite familiar with the people over
[47:31] there as well so we'll just see what the
[47:33] Lord has in store God bless you Sister
[47:35] Rosie
[47:36] [Applause]
[47:43] you know
[47:45] I just uh
[47:47] I'm probably gonna seem scattered
[47:50] but I just trust the Lord will uh take
[47:53] the word today and just bless it
[47:55] just bless it to our spiritual
[47:57] nourishment
[48:00] you know when we look at our lives
[48:03] and we see who we are as believers
[48:07] we have to remember that we're not
[48:10] wrestling against flesh and blood
[48:13] we're not wrestling against our brother
[48:15] and our sister our husband our wives our
[48:19] children even though my goodness it
[48:21] feels like we're wrestling with our
[48:22] children and as parents we wonder why
[48:25] are we wrestling with our children
[48:26] the children are supposed to obey their
[48:28] parents why are we wrestling with our
[48:30] wives our wives are supposed to just
[48:32] submit to us as husbands
[48:34] but as husbands are we submitting to the
[48:37] Lord because the word says to follow me
[48:39] as I follow Christ that's what Paul told
[48:41] the church the female
[48:44] but we need to recognize that we are
[48:45] subject to a higher power Romans 13
[48:48] verse 1 says let every soul be subject
[48:50] unto the higher powers for there is no
[48:53] power but of God
[48:55] the powers that are ordained of God Amen
[48:59] amen so if we have a power inside an
[49:02] office or inside a relationship it's
[49:04] only the power of God that we have we
[49:06] don't have our own power
[49:08] Every Soul needs to be subject unto the
[49:11] higher powers
[49:12] verse 2 says whosoever therefore
[49:14] resisteth the power
[49:17] resisteth the ordinance of God
[49:20] and they that resist shall receive to
[49:24] themselves damnation
[49:27] and where I want to go today is just a
[49:29] discussion I guess about King David
[49:33] and the life of King David and how the
[49:35] life of King David it's just so good and
[49:38] so rich we're all super familiar with it
[49:40] I know but it's just the direction the
[49:42] Lord has taken me and I believe that the
[49:45] life of King David it parallels the life
[49:47] of a believer
[49:48] the life of a real believer
[49:51] it can be pretty easy to not act like
[49:55] King David
[49:56] King David had so much occasion
[49:58] to act upon his enemies
[50:01] but did he
[50:03] did not act on his enemies
[50:05] he simply took it
[50:07] and went forwards even to the point
[50:10] where and and I'm just jumping to the
[50:12] very end but even to the point where his
[50:14] son came against him and remember when
[50:17] Absalom came against him and and his
[50:20] generals went out and risked their lives
[50:22] to kill to take and destroy the enemy
[50:26] Absalom which was his son they went out
[50:29] and destroyed his son they put their
[50:31] lives at risk to go out and have this
[50:33] battle to save the king and to save his
[50:35] throne because absolence we know his his
[50:38] mission was to kill David was to kill
[50:40] his father
[50:41] murderer we know that was demonic it was
[50:44] satanic but we know that was a prophecy
[50:46] as well but his mission was to destroy
[50:49] his dad and in the end
[50:52] after they came back and gave word to
[50:54] say
[50:55] the boy is dead
[50:57] he even gave instruction to his generals
[50:59] bring no harm to the boy
[51:01] we know joash he said no no it's enough
[51:05] of this we need to get rid of this we're
[51:07] going to take matters into our own hands
[51:10] even after all of that putting all of
[51:12] their lives at risk David cried out for
[51:15] his son
[51:18] the heart of David
[51:20] just to think about how David's heart
[51:22] was wired is contrary to human thinking
[51:27] it's contrary to what we can comprehend
[51:30] with our human Minds that's why we have
[51:33] to remember that we need to be subject
[51:34] to a higher power not just sometimes not
[51:37] just when we come to church but when we
[51:39] walk the walk not just talk the talk
[51:42] it's easy to talk the talk but when we
[51:44] live our lives in our positions when
[51:46] we're with our families when we're alone
[51:48] we've got to be
[51:51] subject to the higher power
[51:55] we know that David he was taken from
[51:57] being a Shepherd boy
[51:59] to a mighty warrior
[52:01] and what did that we talked about it a
[52:03] couple minutes ago revelation God
[52:05] revealed himself to David David was able
[52:08] to go and save his father's Sheep by the
[52:11] anointing that God gave him not through
[52:13] the prophet but through a revelation
[52:16] and then we know that he was anointed
[52:19] there was an anointing there was a call
[52:20] but where did that call come from it's
[52:22] so beautiful it came from a prophet
[52:24] didn't it
[52:25] came from a prophet when he was just
[52:27] busy living his life doing his own thing
[52:28] David was nobody just doing nothing
[52:31] really in the eyes of the world and
[52:34] that's how many times us as Believers
[52:36] can be just out there doing our own
[52:38] thing but we hear the call of a prophet
[52:39] and something happens to us we follow
[52:42] that call when we follow that call
[52:43] there's an anointing that comes with it
[52:45] whether we recognize it or not
[52:48] and we know that he wasn't just anointed
[52:50] to be successful in looking after his
[52:53] father's sheep he was anointed to be
[52:55] king
[52:57] he was anointed to be king over Israel
[53:00] we know that all of this that was going
[53:02] on in the background was forming a
[53:04] character inside of David to become king
[53:07] to be able to take the throne to be able
[53:10] to Reign and and it's such an
[53:12] interesting parallel I believe
[53:16] but you know
[53:18] David wasn't able to be king on his own
[53:22] this is really what I want to get into
[53:24] and it's probably going to be a few
[53:25] service discussion we'll see
[53:27] maybe just today and tonight
[53:30] but what got David to the place where he
[53:33] was ready to be king was that he got to
[53:35] the place where he had a contrite spirit
[53:38] we had a humble heart
[53:41] he did not get puffed up he got crushed
[53:44] David was crushed to powder
[53:47] but yet something in him
[53:49] let him praise the Lord
[53:51] and we know that's exactly according to
[53:53] the word of God to say you know thank
[53:55] the Lord for the fiery trials don't get
[53:57] upset and say oh woe is me because of
[54:00] this trial we need to be rejoicing
[54:02] thanking God for the trial
[54:04] which is contrary to what this human
[54:07] flesh would say
[54:09] what the devil wants us to say
[54:11] thank the Lord for the trial because we
[54:14] know that it's worth more than the
[54:15] precious gold tried in the fire
[54:20] our trials
[54:21] are really what helps
[54:23] form us really what helps form us to
[54:27] have the character to rule and to Reign
[54:29] if we're going to be a king if we're
[54:31] going to sit with him in his throne
[54:32] brother and sister it's not going to be
[54:35] a free gift for us to just walk out of
[54:37] this world and into that world and set
[54:39] with him in his throne we need to be
[54:40] like King David and recognize that we
[54:42] are going to be tried tested and true we
[54:45] are going to prove that we have that
[54:47] Spirit of Christ in us through a
[54:49] contrite spirit through a humble heart
[54:52] we are not going to get puffed up and
[54:54] say hey I I believe God sent a prophet
[54:56] and all is good and I've baptized and
[54:58] saved and everything is going to be fine
[54:59] Satan's going to challenge us on every
[55:02] single front and you know what if we
[55:03] don't have the real deal then all that
[55:05] can be shaken will be shaken we'll be
[55:07] shaken right out of the church
[55:10] but what will get us to the place where
[55:12] we know that we know I hope we can get
[55:14] to that today
[55:16] James 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace
[55:20] wherefore he saith God resisteth the
[55:23] proud
[55:24] but giveth Grace unto the humble
[55:28] he giveth Grace unto the humble and he
[55:31] resists the proud We were talking about
[55:33] this on the way to church today about
[55:35] resisting and I just can't help but
[55:37] think about the the the description how
[55:41] if you've ever played with magnets
[55:43] before you can have magnets and if you
[55:46] point them the right way I'm not an
[55:48] expert but I'm just going to word it the
[55:50] way that I know it if you point them one
[55:51] way they will actually attract together
[55:53] they'll snap together because there's
[55:55] actually an attraction but if you put
[55:57] them the other way one magnet turn it
[56:00] the other way it will resist you will
[56:03] not be able to push those two magnets
[56:04] together you can get them really close
[56:05] together but they'll never totally come
[56:08] together
[56:09] and it's interesting because I just
[56:11] can't help but think that's exactly what
[56:13] God's spirit does with a proud spirit
[56:15] with someone who is actually a bit
[56:17] puffed up in their life they're they're
[56:19] in a position where they just can't let
[56:22] go of something
[56:24] remember brother random preach the
[56:25] message doors in a door and usually what
[56:28] it is there's one place in the human
[56:29] heart we know there's one place in the
[56:32] human heart where God made for his own
[56:34] self to reside in and it's only in a
[56:37] human heart that was proven by science
[56:38] brother Branham said but we know inside
[56:40] that little space there's little
[56:42] compartments I'm going to word it this
[56:44] way there's little compartments inside
[56:45] that little space and unless we're
[56:47] willing to give that entire little space
[56:48] we will not see the spirit of Christ in
[56:50] our lives well it won't be a part of an
[56:53] anointing and we'll see a good move and
[56:54] it will feel good but it won't be the
[56:57] indwelling that sealing of the Holy
[56:58] Ghost In Our Lives because God resists
[57:01] the proud he resists the proud but
[57:04] giveth Grace unto the humble submit
[57:06] yourselves therefore to God
[57:09] resist the devil and he will flee from
[57:11] you
[57:12] many times what I I see brothers and
[57:15] sisters and I'm guilty of it and I just
[57:17] want to say it this way I trust it's
[57:18] okay that sometimes many times we can
[57:21] find ourselves running from a devil and
[57:24] trying to to outwit a devil and outmatch
[57:27] a devil and outdo a devil and and maybe
[57:30] we'll take the word of God and try and
[57:31] apply it to a devil but that's not the
[57:33] way to deal with the Devil the only way
[57:35] we're going to deal with the Devil is to
[57:37] have the right attitude to recognize
[57:39] it's only going to be a humble heart
[57:41] that God will use to deal with the Devil
[57:45] but first we have to submit ourselves
[57:47] unto God then we have to resist the
[57:50] devil there is something for us to do
[57:53] we've got to do those first two parts
[57:55] but when we do those first two parts
[57:56] what's the scripture say we don't try
[57:59] and Chase the devil we don't try and run
[58:01] from a devil we just let the devil flee
[58:03] from us that's what the word says the
[58:05] devil will flee from us draw nigh to God
[58:08] He will draw nigh to you cleanse your
[58:10] hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts
[58:12] you double-minded be afflicted and mourn
[58:14] and weep let your laughter be turned to
[58:16] mourning and your joy to heaviness
[58:18] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[58:20] Lord and He Shall lift you up
[58:23] we cannot just lift ourselves up and
[58:26] think that it's going to be okay it
[58:27] won't be okay brothers and sisters
[58:30] we've got to make sure that we we keep
[58:32] ourselves in tune with the word of God
[58:35] and you know as I look at this stuff I I
[58:37] I study it I I think Lord help me I
[58:40] wonder Lord I I really don't feel like I
[58:44] want to go and talk about this because
[58:45] it almost feels like something is is is
[58:48] is is happening not in a good way it
[58:50] doesn't make me feel good to do this but
[58:52] I just have to follow the leadership of
[58:54] the Lord like I said to you that word
[58:56] came to me at about four o'clock this
[58:57] morning then I heard it in a prayer then
[58:59] I heard it in a song I say Amen okay
[59:01] let's go let's see what the Lord has in
[59:03] store for us you know in that message he
[59:06] careth for you first Peter 5 verse 5
[59:09] likewise ye younger submit yourselves
[59:11] unto the Elder yay all of you be subject
[59:14] one to another and be clothed with
[59:17] humility for God resisteth the proud and
[59:21] giveth grace to the humble humble
[59:23] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[59:25] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[59:27] time casting all your care upon him for
[59:30] he careth for you
[59:33] I just can't help but think that that
[59:35] could be the title of the service today
[59:37] but I know it's it's it's a contrite
[59:39] spirit it's a contrite heart just
[59:42] contrite would be the title if I had to
[59:44] give it one
[59:46] he cares for you brothers and sisters
[59:48] that's why he gives us trials that's why
[59:50] we get the Fiery trials in our lives
[59:53] because he cares for us he won't allow
[59:55] sin to go unpunished he won't allow sin
[59:58] to lay there in our lives undetected he
[1:00:01] will always identify the sin we know the
[1:00:04] word says be sure that your sins will
[1:00:05] find you out it's so that God will make
[1:00:08] sure that we are all in our position all
[1:00:11] of his children will come to him not one
[1:00:13] of them will be lost we know that's what
[1:00:15] the word says
[1:00:18] we want to see the spirit of the Lord
[1:00:20] move in our lives and you know what I I
[1:00:22] just think brothers and sisters is it's
[1:00:24] going to be a Revival and it's going to
[1:00:26] be the bride's Revival we can look up
[1:00:27] bride's Revival I'm not going there
[1:00:29] today but we all know it brother Bradham
[1:00:31] says it if you haven't known it or you
[1:00:33] haven't heard him say it just look it up
[1:00:35] bride's Revival brother Branham talks
[1:00:37] about it there is a revival going on and
[1:00:38] it's an individual Revival it's the
[1:00:41] bride's Revival his bride around the
[1:00:43] world it's happening whether people see
[1:00:45] it or they don't it's happening doesn't
[1:00:47] matter it's not a great big show we know
[1:00:50] that that's the third poll the bride's
[1:00:51] Revival it's the word being manifest to
[1:00:54] this world
[1:00:55] and as we eat it we become it
[1:01:02] you know today
[1:01:04] what I want to do brothers and sisters
[1:01:06] I want to tear down strongholds
[1:01:09] because that's what the word says
[1:01:11] I want to I want to try and get right
[1:01:13] down to the nitty-gritty of some of this
[1:01:15] stuff right down to the root cause
[1:01:17] because if we can get down to the roots
[1:01:20] of things we can actually fix things but
[1:01:23] if we just always maybe just spray the
[1:01:26] plant on the top and maybe just prune a
[1:01:28] little bit on the top and and try and do
[1:01:30] a topical ointment we're not really
[1:01:32] getting to the root of the matter but if
[1:01:34] we can get right down to the
[1:01:35] nitty-gritty I believe we can see the
[1:01:37] power of God move in our lives maybe in
[1:01:40] a way that would be maybe just a little
[1:01:42] bit different than what we've seen and
[1:01:44] I'm not saying that we're Sinners and
[1:01:45] and we've got terrible sin in the camp
[1:01:47] what I'm saying is I want to see great
[1:01:49] success spiritually speaking in our
[1:01:51] lives brothers and sisters where we know
[1:01:53] that any Joe Lewis Spirit could walk
[1:01:55] through that door like brother Branham
[1:01:57] said and actually be cast out we know
[1:02:00] that there would not be one Spirit able
[1:02:02] to stand in the midst of the Church of
[1:02:04] the Living God
[1:02:06] today I just want to potentially get
[1:02:08] into tearing down strongholds I just
[1:02:10] can't help but think about David's life
[1:02:12] being a parallel of the True Believer
[1:02:14] and how he was at one time out doing his
[1:02:17] own thing but he was called by the voice
[1:02:19] of the Prophet to be anointed and it's
[1:02:21] the same thing for us brothers and
[1:02:22] sisters we can come to that place where
[1:02:24] we've been anointed by the prophet and
[1:02:26] it can take some time for that anointing
[1:02:28] to actually come to the place where
[1:02:30] we're able to see something change in
[1:02:33] our lives but what we have to do is put
[1:02:35] one foot in front of the other and keep
[1:02:36] marching forward we cannot be weak we
[1:02:40] can't be cowardly we have to March
[1:02:43] forward brother Branham says God says he
[1:02:45] can't use a coward
[1:02:46] so if we just get upset and turn our
[1:02:49] back on the word or on the church then
[1:02:50] how can we ever go forwards in the word
[1:02:55] but remember he was anointed by the
[1:02:57] spirit
[1:02:58] from the prophet
[1:03:00] I think that's such a beautiful thought
[1:03:03] but in the meantime he was dealing with
[1:03:05] Saul who had an agenda and Saul wanted
[1:03:07] to kill him
[1:03:09] Saul didn't like the fact that he
[1:03:12] actually was maybe favored by God he he
[1:03:16] it started way back when they went out
[1:03:18] and they went to battle and when they
[1:03:20] came back into the city we know this was
[1:03:22] probably after he killed Goliath David
[1:03:24] after Saul and David came back from the
[1:03:27] battles they came into the City and and
[1:03:29] they said oh Saul he killed his hundreds
[1:03:32] they were singing the song right the
[1:03:34] women were or the people were
[1:03:36] but David killed his thousands
[1:03:39] what a tremendous thing that is to hear
[1:03:42] but what a terrible thing that would be
[1:03:44] for Saul to recognize but he realized
[1:03:47] something happened in his life he
[1:03:49] recognized that the kingdom was actually
[1:03:51] changing
[1:03:53] and we know that Saul he actually didn't
[1:03:55] follow the word of the Lord he actually
[1:03:57] took the king of the amorites was it and
[1:03:59] and they decided you know we're just
[1:04:01] we're just gonna take the fatlings we're
[1:04:03] going to take the good cows and we're
[1:04:04] going to take the good sheep and you
[1:04:06] know we'll kill most of the people but
[1:04:07] we'll bring the king in and we'll save
[1:04:09] him as well we won't kill him right away
[1:04:11] and what happened when the prophet came
[1:04:14] to him when Samuel came to him he said
[1:04:16] what on Earth are you doing firstly
[1:04:18] you're doing a sacrifice out of order
[1:04:20] you know brother Branham he talks about
[1:04:22] it try to do God a service without a
[1:04:24] being as well he just didn't want to
[1:04:25] wait for the prophet to come and allow
[1:04:27] the prophet to do what he was supposed
[1:04:28] to do to offer the sacrifice so what
[1:04:31] happened he goes ahead and does a
[1:04:32] sacrifice he goes ahead and keeps he
[1:04:34] does everything against what the
[1:04:36] instruction was and the prophet said to
[1:04:38] him you know what because of this this
[1:04:40] is not the first time it's not the
[1:04:41] second time it's it's many times and
[1:04:44] this is it God's done with you the
[1:04:46] kingdom is going to be rent out of your
[1:04:48] hands and what did he do then he got
[1:04:50] serious then he wanted to pray then he
[1:04:52] wanted to fast then he wanted to have a
[1:04:54] religious service then he wanted to get
[1:04:56] excited only because then he actually
[1:04:58] knew where he stood brothers and sisters
[1:05:00] we don't have to wait until the end
[1:05:02] until things get terrible in our lives
[1:05:04] to decide to get serious to decide to
[1:05:06] have a Revival in our lives
[1:05:08] we can do it now we can do it today I
[1:05:12] just can't help but think how exciting
[1:05:14] that is
[1:05:15] all had an agenda he didn't like that
[1:05:17] David had the spirit of the Lord the
[1:05:19] spirit of the Lord was with David and
[1:05:22] you know I I know this for sure brothers
[1:05:23] and sisters people don't like it when
[1:05:25] the spirit of the Lord is with you they
[1:05:27] can see it and you know they can't
[1:05:29] necessarily say the spirit of the Lord
[1:05:31] that person but there's something
[1:05:32] different about that person brother
[1:05:34] Branham says you might be a little bit
[1:05:35] of a fanatic right
[1:05:38] you need to be careful who who we look
[1:05:40] at and who we judge because that could
[1:05:42] easily be the spirit of the Lord with
[1:05:44] that person
[1:05:45] but Saul didn't like that David he had
[1:05:47] the ability to cast out Devils with
[1:05:49] music
[1:05:51] so through Saul's disobedience
[1:05:54] he was able to get angry at David
[1:05:57] because he was disobedient now he he was
[1:06:00] going to take it and take it out on
[1:06:02] David and we know that that drove him
[1:06:04] mad brothers and sisters this morning if
[1:06:07] I just want to say this it's so vital
[1:06:10] for us to recognize it's really kind of
[1:06:12] cut and dried call it black and white
[1:06:14] call it call it I don't know what you
[1:06:16] want to call it but call it good or bad
[1:06:18] but if we refuse
[1:06:21] to accept the holy spirit in our lives
[1:06:24] we don't just accept the mark of the
[1:06:26] beast that's that's one thing we do
[1:06:28] that's sort of a title that we can give
[1:06:30] it if we refuse the spirit of God in our
[1:06:33] lives then God will give us over to an
[1:06:36] evil spirit he won't just leave us on
[1:06:38] our own to be neutral in our own land to
[1:06:41] just carry on until we go into
[1:06:42] destruction he will give us an evil
[1:06:45] spirit
[1:06:46] he will allow that to come our way
[1:06:49] we need to make sure we know where we
[1:06:51] stand
[1:06:52] that's why I keep saying harping on the
[1:06:54] Holy Ghost you got to have the Holy
[1:06:55] Ghost you have to
[1:06:57] there's no other option in our day
[1:06:59] brothers and sisters
[1:07:00] and the only way you get it is to repent
[1:07:02] recognize that you're a sinner you come
[1:07:05] into the world speaking lies born in sin
[1:07:07] shapes and iniquity
[1:07:09] and that you need the Holy Ghost you
[1:07:10] need Christ to save you you need a
[1:07:13] savior and when you recognize that and
[1:07:15] you follow his word and get baptized in
[1:07:17] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:21] for the remission of your sins then you
[1:07:23] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:24] you'll get the Holy Ghost you'll be
[1:07:25] sealed in till the day of your
[1:07:27] Redemption that's it one one and done
[1:07:28] call it one and done and you know what
[1:07:30] how you can tell if you are one and done
[1:07:32] you'll follow the word that's all you'll
[1:07:35] just say Amen to the word for your day
[1:07:37] I think it's so beautiful I was
[1:07:39] listening to the messages and brother
[1:07:41] Brandon was talking about it how you
[1:07:43] know he was talking to a brother who was
[1:07:46] one of the hardest Brothers he said to
[1:07:48] uh convert I can't remember what the
[1:07:50] message is offhand but he said you know
[1:07:52] this brother he was baptized in uh
[1:07:54] titles and he was really really
[1:07:57] argumentative about it and brother
[1:07:59] Branham said to him you know you don't
[1:08:00] have to get so upset about it just get
[1:08:01] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ no no no no no it's got to be the
[1:08:06] Father the Son the Holy Ghost brother
[1:08:08] Branham finally said to him would you
[1:08:09] get baptized then would you baptize
[1:08:11] someone in the name of the Rose of
[1:08:13] Sharon
[1:08:15] nope the lily of the valley
[1:08:17] nope the Bright Morning Star
[1:08:20] nope
[1:08:22] he said those are all titles
[1:08:24] he said so is father so is Son and so is
[1:08:28] Holy Ghost they're all titles
[1:08:30] everybody here knows this I know there
[1:08:32] might be someone watching that doesn't
[1:08:33] but the true name is the name of the
[1:08:37] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:39] that's why he came in a Corporal body
[1:08:41] that's why he came to the Earth
[1:08:44] so that he could have that name so that
[1:08:46] we could comprehend with our finite
[1:08:48] Minds God in flesh in the beginning was
[1:08:51] the word the word was made flesh and
[1:08:54] dwelt Among Us
[1:08:57] David
[1:08:58] was dealing with the King that turned
[1:09:01] mad
[1:09:02] and why did he turn mad because he
[1:09:04] resisted the Holy Ghost in his day he
[1:09:07] resisted the leadership of the Lord in
[1:09:09] his day and what was that in his day it
[1:09:11] was actually the word of the prophet
[1:09:13] some might say well the Holy Ghost
[1:09:14] wasn't yet given and no it truly wasn't
[1:09:16] but the leadership of the Lord is the
[1:09:18] same as the Holy Ghost it's the same
[1:09:20] Spirit whether it's in the Old Testament
[1:09:22] or the New Testament
[1:09:25] you know that uh
[1:09:29] David was given the opportunity to
[1:09:31] destroy this guy who was coming at him
[1:09:34] Saul
[1:09:35] Saul
[1:09:36] he wanted to kill him and David had many
[1:09:38] occasions
[1:09:39] a few occasions to kill him that we know
[1:09:41] of
[1:09:42] but he also knew first chronicles 16 22
[1:09:45] saying touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:09:48] prophets no harm
[1:09:50] David knew the word so he wouldn't go
[1:09:53] further than the word said he could
[1:09:55] because he had a contrite heart
[1:09:59] because he had a humble spirit
[1:10:03] even when he heard Saul was killed
[1:10:07] I believe the messenger
[1:10:09] said let's Rejoice let's party and what
[1:10:12] did David do he said no
[1:10:14] this is wrong
[1:10:16] one of God's anointed were killed today
[1:10:19] this was a great man of God and he was
[1:10:22] anointed and raised up of God
[1:10:25] it wasn't just some haphazard thing
[1:10:28] but he was a rejected King he rejected
[1:10:31] the leadership of the Holy Ghost in his
[1:10:33] life he was given over to an evil spirit
[1:10:35] it's no different for us brothers and
[1:10:38] sisters if you're a king and a priest
[1:10:39] you reject the leadership of the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost you won't just sit neutral
[1:10:44] but even when Saul was killed he was
[1:10:47] upset
[1:10:48] and you know brothers and sisters this
[1:10:50] is really where I'm going I'm just sort
[1:10:51] of laying a background here and and
[1:10:53] that's why it might seem a little bit
[1:10:55] weird I guess but David didn't climb his
[1:10:58] way to the throne
[1:11:00] many times people might paint that
[1:11:02] picture that David he just climbed his
[1:11:04] way right up the steps right to the
[1:11:05] throne what happened was David was
[1:11:08] crushed all the way to the throne
[1:11:10] David had to continually check his heart
[1:11:13] David had to continually throw down his
[1:11:17] own Pride he continually had to make
[1:11:20] sure that he was not puffing himself up
[1:11:23] and standing up and doing what maybe
[1:11:24] rightly he could according to the word
[1:11:26] what he did do was actually follow the
[1:11:29] leadership of the Lord and we know that
[1:11:30] David was the type of Christ
[1:11:36] isn't it interesting to look at the life
[1:11:38] of David as you go on maybe this is
[1:11:40] weird but I I don't know I guess we'll
[1:11:42] just go for the ride but David then
[1:11:44] after Saul was gone he did Ascend to the
[1:11:46] throne by following the word but what
[1:11:49] happened there were still some of David
[1:11:51] that had to be taken out of him wasn't
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:53] there was murder inside of David there
[1:11:57] was adultery inside of David both of
[1:12:00] those things had to come out of him and
[1:12:02] you know how do they come out of our
[1:12:04] Lives brothers and sisters by exposing
[1:12:06] them
[1:12:07] only by exposing them we know that David
[1:12:11] he was given the word from the prophet
[1:12:13] after this happened after he he had
[1:12:16] Uriah killed and and Nathan came to him
[1:12:19] and told him the story about the man
[1:12:21] with the sheep and how he had the lamb
[1:12:23] and and the one was was was full of
[1:12:25] plentius and and the other one he had
[1:12:27] only one it was his special lamb
[1:12:30] but this man came and took that one and
[1:12:33] we know the prophet Nathan he came in
[1:12:35] and he told them that's you David that's
[1:12:37] you David you need to actually listen up
[1:12:40] because God has a word from you because
[1:12:43] you took Uriah and you killed him by the
[1:12:46] sword of the enemy and you took his wife
[1:12:49] now God will judge you and isn't it
[1:12:52] wonderful to think in the midst of that
[1:12:54] judgment the prophet said oh by the way
[1:12:56] God will spare your life you won't die
[1:13:00] even though you should die because that
[1:13:01] was the word that you said what should
[1:13:03] happen to that man that actually stepped
[1:13:05] over
[1:13:06] we should require his life today plus he
[1:13:09] should pay fourfold the crime
[1:13:14] but God who is rich in Mercy hey
[1:13:18] says Nope he's a man after my own heart
[1:13:22] and we'll not kill you but that baby
[1:13:24] that baby will be required of you today
[1:13:29] kill this man took his wife had a baby
[1:13:32] he still had that that adultery and he
[1:13:35] still had that murder inside of him the
[1:13:37] anointed one
[1:13:40] but isn't it wonderful how God deals
[1:13:42] with that stuff like like we said he he
[1:13:45] deals with it by exposing it
[1:13:48] by exposing it by bringing it up to the
[1:13:49] surface so it's not hidden anymore and
[1:13:52] that's what trials do in our lives
[1:13:53] brothers and sisters brother Branham
[1:13:55] talks about the lake being stirred up
[1:13:57] what it does is it stirs up all the
[1:13:58] trash and it brings it out to the place
[1:14:00] where we can gather it up and get rid of
[1:14:02] it
[1:14:03] not try and push it down under the water
[1:14:05] and and just hide it and maybe just keep
[1:14:08] it around you don't want that in our
[1:14:10] lives
[1:14:11] God forgave him for his sin but he took
[1:14:14] the baby's life
[1:14:16] and we know in the word
[1:14:19] it's such an interesting thought that
[1:14:20] Bathsheba
[1:14:22] was never called David's wife
[1:14:24] was she
[1:14:25] was always called the wife of Uriah
[1:14:29] the king's wife was always called the
[1:14:32] wife of Uriah
[1:14:34] but as he went forwards
[1:14:37] he knew there was a prophecy in his life
[1:14:40] he heard it the prophet gave it to him
[1:14:42] for second Samuel 12. maybe we could
[1:14:45] just turn the there sorry
[1:14:47] turned he there
[1:14:50] second Samuel chapter 12 verse 8.
[1:14:55] it's okay this morning
[1:15:00] looking at a contrite heart
[1:15:03] and how the Lord used David to give us
[1:15:05] an example
[1:15:11] second Samuel 12 verse 8. this is the
[1:15:15] prophecy that David had now as he went
[1:15:18] forward as a king
[1:15:20] knowing god at the level that he knew
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:24] he had this prophecy in his heart Thy
[1:15:26] word have I hid in mine heart that I
[1:15:28] might not sin against thee
[1:15:31] II Samuel 12 verse 8 says and I gave
[1:15:35] thee thy Master's house
[1:15:37] and thy Master's wives into thy bosom
[1:15:42] and gave Thee the house of Israel
[1:15:45] and of Judah
[1:15:47] and if that had been too little
[1:15:50] I would moreover have given unto thee
[1:15:54] such and such things
[1:15:57] wherefore hast thou despised the
[1:16:00] Commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[1:16:02] his sight
[1:16:03] thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with
[1:16:06] the sword and has taken his wife to be
[1:16:09] thy wife and has slain him with the
[1:16:12] sword of the children of Ammon
[1:16:15] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:16:18] depart from thine house
[1:16:19] because thou Hast despised me
[1:16:22] and has taken the wife of Uriah the
[1:16:25] hittite to be thy wife
[1:16:28] thus saith the Lord behold I will raise
[1:16:31] up evil against thee out of thine own
[1:16:33] house and I will take thy wives before
[1:16:36] thine eyes and give them unto Thy
[1:16:39] Neighbor
[1:16:40] and he shall lie with thy wives in the
[1:16:43] sight of this son
[1:16:46] for thou ditched it secretly
[1:16:48] but I will do this thing before all
[1:16:51] Israel and before the sun
[1:16:55] where I want to get to with that is that
[1:16:57] God
[1:16:58] would not hide this sin
[1:17:01] it turned into a tremendous problem for
[1:17:04] him when Absalom started this
[1:17:06] insurrection
[1:17:07] when his son raised up and decided that
[1:17:10] he was going to take over the throne
[1:17:12] we know that it started so subtly
[1:17:16] just with maybe a a conversation
[1:17:19] maybe in someone's living room just a
[1:17:22] discussion
[1:17:24] and then it turned into more
[1:17:25] conversation and more discussion
[1:17:28] and before long suddenly he started to
[1:17:31] feel like maybe there was something for
[1:17:33] him to do and we know that this was the
[1:17:35] pointed of the Lord this was prophecy
[1:17:37] coming to pass he probably couldn't even
[1:17:39] help it himself
[1:17:43] you know God said to David I gave thee
[1:17:46] thy Master's house
[1:17:47] and and all of his wives and everything
[1:17:49] that was in it and if that had been too
[1:17:51] little I'm moreover would have given
[1:17:53] unto these such and such things whatever
[1:17:55] you wanted David if you would have just
[1:17:57] said it to me if you would have wanted
[1:17:58] Bathsheba
[1:18:00] I would have gave her to you but you had
[1:18:03] to ask me for it
[1:18:05] if you would have wanted another wife I
[1:18:07] would have given her to you but you had
[1:18:08] to ask me for it you couldn't just go
[1:18:10] and do it on your own
[1:18:13] but I I just think this is the part here
[1:18:15] that really I think is critical for us
[1:18:18] when we look at this as paralleling the
[1:18:20] life of a Believer wherefore hast thou
[1:18:22] despised the Commandment of the Lord
[1:18:24] to do evil in his sight
[1:18:27] how many times in our lives do we
[1:18:29] despise the Commandment of the Lord
[1:18:31] and what happens is we wind up doing
[1:18:33] evil in his sight when we despise the
[1:18:36] Commandment of the Lord and we know the
[1:18:38] Commandments of the Lord there's many of
[1:18:40] them but as Believers we live under
[1:18:42] grace don't we many times we could say
[1:18:44] that we live under grace so the
[1:18:46] Commandments don't have any effect but
[1:18:47] they do have effect and you know Jesus
[1:18:50] said when he came I don't come to do
[1:18:52] away with the law I came to magnify the
[1:18:54] law I I came to show you that we could
[1:18:56] actually live that law in our flesh and
[1:18:58] when we come to the place in our lives
[1:19:00] as a Christian believer where we say I
[1:19:02] just can't do it on my own that's
[1:19:03] exactly where God wants us to get
[1:19:05] because that's the beginning of a
[1:19:06] contrite heart and a broken spirit and a
[1:19:09] humble heart that's where God wants us
[1:19:10] to get to the place where we recognize
[1:19:12] we can't do it on our own and many times
[1:19:15] if people don't have the right
[1:19:16] foundation in their lives according to
[1:19:19] the word that's where they'll just burn
[1:19:21] up and leave they'll just be out of the
[1:19:23] church in the heartbeat because they
[1:19:25] can't do it on their own they're 100
[1:19:26] right the only way we can do it on our
[1:19:28] own is to get the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:19:30] Lives when we have the Holy Ghost in our
[1:19:31] Our Lives we will do it the right way
[1:19:34] and you know maybe we'll make a mistake
[1:19:35] we'll trip and fall we might not
[1:19:37] understand what the scripture says about
[1:19:39] a certain thing but if we do hear
[1:19:41] correction about that through the
[1:19:43] scripture through the message well what
[1:19:45] happened to us as a true son and
[1:19:46] daughter of God we will surrender our
[1:19:49] will to that word every single time we
[1:19:52] will not say no no no I'm I got it I
[1:19:54] know that I'm doing things right this is
[1:19:56] the way that I've been taught remember
[1:19:57] brother Branham talked about the little
[1:19:59] Sunfish that was raised up he told about
[1:20:01] that prophecy about that little animal
[1:20:02] that was going to be raised up I just
[1:20:03] can't help but think about that that man
[1:20:05] that was there with him that Jehovah's
[1:20:07] Witness I believe it was and he said
[1:20:09] that he was throwing that fly line out
[1:20:11] if there's anybody here that fishes
[1:20:13] you'll know what I'm talking about he's
[1:20:14] throwing the fly line out and and he's
[1:20:16] just taken and letting the fish swallow
[1:20:19] that hook all the way down instead of
[1:20:21] actually just catching the fish is what
[1:20:23] brother Branham said when you see a fish
[1:20:24] rise to a fly line you can actually
[1:20:26] catch it
[1:20:28] but what I'm saying is such a simple
[1:20:29] analogy is the prophet gave him
[1:20:32] correction he said you don't have to do
[1:20:34] it that way you can just catch the fish
[1:20:35] but what did he say oh that's the way we
[1:20:39] do it around here that's just the way we
[1:20:40] do it brothers and sisters sometimes we
[1:20:42] can be guilty of saying that that's just
[1:20:44] the way we do it around here that's just
[1:20:46] the way we've always done it that's the
[1:20:48] way I was raised does it line up with
[1:20:51] the word that's the only thing I can say
[1:20:53] if it lines up with the word then let's
[1:20:54] high five and say Amen to that but if it
[1:20:57] isn't lining up with the word if there
[1:20:58] is something that maybe isn't congruent
[1:21:01] with the message of the hour then let's
[1:21:02] take a step backwards and just maybe
[1:21:04] think about it for a little bit
[1:21:07] because he resists the proud and if
[1:21:10] we're not willing to say maybe I'll take
[1:21:12] a look at this word and and see what it
[1:21:15] is because I have a humble spirit and
[1:21:17] I've got a contrite heart
[1:21:20] we become proud if we're not there
[1:21:24] but wherefore hast thou despise the
[1:21:26] Commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[1:21:28] his sight
[1:21:30] thou has killed Uriah the hittite with
[1:21:31] the sword taken his wife to be thy wife
[1:21:34] slain him with the sword of the children
[1:21:35] of Ammon now therefore the sword shall
[1:21:38] never depart from thine house because
[1:21:40] thou Hast despised me and has taken the
[1:21:43] wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife
[1:21:45] thus saith the Lord behold I will raise
[1:21:47] up evil against thee out of thine own
[1:21:49] house and I will take thy wives before
[1:21:52] thine eyes and give them unto thy
[1:21:54] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[1:21:57] in the sight of this son
[1:21:59] for thou didst it secretly but I will do
[1:22:02] this thing before all Israel and before
[1:22:04] the sun
[1:22:06] I don't have the scripture in front of
[1:22:07] me but this is exactly what happened
[1:22:10] when David was disgraced when David
[1:22:12] walked away from the city when David
[1:22:14] went back out into the Wilderness the
[1:22:16] second time
[1:22:18] because
[1:22:19] he wasn't climbing his way to the throne
[1:22:21] he knew that this was coming in his life
[1:22:23] he knew that that sword would raise up
[1:22:26] in his house he knew that evil was just
[1:22:28] there in his house and there was no way
[1:22:31] that he could Escape it because it was
[1:22:32] the word of the Lord it was thus saith
[1:22:34] the Lord from the prophet and it was
[1:22:36] just a matter of time before it began to
[1:22:37] manifest in his life and the people
[1:22:39] around him couldn't understand that but
[1:22:41] David knew in his heart he knew that God
[1:22:43] had spoke and the only thing that he
[1:22:45] could do was just govern himself
[1:22:47] accordingly at that point and that's
[1:22:49] what he did he stepped aside and he went
[1:22:51] out into the Wilderness and he didn't
[1:22:53] take the throne he didn't climb clamor
[1:22:55] he didn't fight his son he just let his
[1:22:58] son do his thing and this scripture came
[1:23:00] to pass God allowed his sin to be
[1:23:03] manifest David's sin to be manifest
[1:23:06] before all of Israel if you recall the
[1:23:08] scripture it's the one I said I don't
[1:23:09] have it's there in Samuel I believe
[1:23:11] where Absalom was instructed by one of
[1:23:15] the one of the counselors in the king's
[1:23:18] court to take an erected tent on top of
[1:23:21] the building and show everyone now that
[1:23:24] he can have relations with his father's
[1:23:26] wives with the concubines what a
[1:23:28] terrible thing that is what an open
[1:23:31] display of sin that is but that's the
[1:23:33] way God will do it if we will not be
[1:23:35] willing to Humble our hearts in the
[1:23:37] sight of the Lord so he can lift us up
[1:23:39] he will take and expose whatever it is
[1:23:42] we've got in secret and allow it to
[1:23:44] manifest before everyone's eyes and
[1:23:47] that's when it becomes so difficult
[1:23:49] because we have got to either get real
[1:23:51] humble or run away one of those two
[1:23:54] things will happen
[1:23:56] but the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:58] they'll just get more humble
[1:24:00] because they'll recognize it's God
[1:24:01] dealing with them and you know brothers
[1:24:03] and sisters the reason I'm going this
[1:24:05] way is I want to see us I want to go
[1:24:07] back to it I want to see a Revival in
[1:24:09] our hearts I want to see a Revival in
[1:24:11] our lives I want to see us not just
[1:24:13] comfortable in the message of the hour
[1:24:15] not just comfortable sitting at Calgary
[1:24:17] Living Word assembly and fellowshipping
[1:24:20] it's good it's wonderful we want to do
[1:24:22] that but we want more we want to get out
[1:24:24] of here we want to see the power of
[1:24:26] almighty God living out through our
[1:24:28] lives otherwise what's the point in it
[1:24:34] contrite
[1:24:36] the seven Church ages brother Branham
[1:24:38] 1954.0512
[1:24:43] you can get forgiveness for crucifying
[1:24:45] Jesus
[1:24:47] you can get forgiveness for taking his
[1:24:49] name in vain
[1:24:52] but who speaks against the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] will never be forgiven him in this world
[1:24:57] or the world to come
[1:25:00] we're in the last day so be careful
[1:25:03] walk humbly
[1:25:05] have a contrite broken spirit
[1:25:07] a humble heart
[1:25:09] willing to let the Holy Spirit Lead You
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:14] we've got to be willing to go that way
[1:25:16] brothers and sisters that's the word of
[1:25:18] the Prophet that's the word of the Lord
[1:25:20] through the prophet for the people we
[1:25:22] know that the word of the lord always
[1:25:24] comes to a prophet
[1:25:27] we need to have a contrite broken spirit
[1:25:30] a humble heart
[1:25:33] willing to let the Holy Spirit lead us
[1:25:36] if we don't have that
[1:25:39] then we don't have the leadership of the
[1:25:40] Lord in our lives Brothers but my
[1:25:42] sisters it's just not the way it works
[1:25:45] brother Branham talks about the lamb and
[1:25:47] the dove the lamb is led by the dove the
[1:25:50] lamb is not led by a wolf nature
[1:25:52] what happens is that Dove just flies up
[1:25:54] to the tree and says you know when you
[1:25:56] get the right nature again I'll come
[1:25:57] back and I'll visit you but until then
[1:25:59] I'm just going to sit up here and many
[1:26:01] times we can think that we've got that
[1:26:03] dove in our lives and we don't have that
[1:26:06] dove in our lives and this trick of the
[1:26:08] devil this is where the devil is it's so
[1:26:10] close that it would deceive they're very
[1:26:12] elected if it were possible he'll come
[1:26:13] around when you have the Dove and try
[1:26:15] and make you think you don't have the
[1:26:16] dove
[1:26:18] what is that
[1:26:20] but if you've got the right Spirit it
[1:26:22] will line up with the word of God it
[1:26:24] will say Amen to the word of God and if
[1:26:26] God exposes something in your life what
[1:26:28] you'll do is trip over yourself to make
[1:26:31] it better
[1:26:32] not run from it and cover it and hide it
[1:26:34] and fight it
[1:26:36] that's not a contrite broken Spirit a
[1:26:38] humble heart willing to let the Holy
[1:26:40] Spirit lead you
[1:26:42] but boy when that happens brothers and
[1:26:44] sisters there ain't nothing that will
[1:26:45] stand in your way there's no price
[1:26:46] that's too big to pay there's no no gift
[1:26:49] too big to give there's no nothing that
[1:26:51] we aren't willing to do when we get to
[1:26:53] that place in our lives where we have
[1:26:55] truly got a contrite broken Spirit a
[1:26:58] humble heart willing to let the Holy
[1:27:00] Spirit lead us there ain't nothing that
[1:27:02] we won't do to follow the will of the
[1:27:04] Lord in our lives nothing we'll quit
[1:27:06] jobs we'll actually move locations we'll
[1:27:09] leave churches we'll go to other
[1:27:10] churches we'll do whatever we need to do
[1:27:12] to please the will of the father because
[1:27:14] that's what a broken heart does that's
[1:27:16] what a contrite spirit does a humble
[1:27:18] heart willing to be led by the Holy
[1:27:20] Spirit we will just do what the Lord
[1:27:22] says for us to do
[1:27:24] you know many times in our lives we can
[1:27:27] talk about these things and uh I I don't
[1:27:30] want to make it so it's you know kind of
[1:27:33] out there and nebulous
[1:27:36] the the quotes can can sometimes do that
[1:27:38] and and even to the point where as
[1:27:41] message Believers children who are
[1:27:43] raised in the message of the hour the
[1:27:44] quotes can can make it seem like well
[1:27:46] it's just it's just do this and then
[1:27:48] you'll get that and it's a real simple
[1:27:49] equation but how does that apply to me
[1:27:51] in my life
[1:27:53] well there's things in our lives that
[1:27:55] are identifiers that I think we can talk
[1:27:57] about but you know one of the things
[1:27:59] that I want to I want to throw out there
[1:28:01] is is
[1:28:03] if we are looking for a different result
[1:28:05] brothers and sisters if we're looking
[1:28:07] for something different to happen in our
[1:28:09] lives we cannot just keep doing the same
[1:28:11] thing over and over expecting a
[1:28:14] different result
[1:28:16] I just want to say this
[1:28:18] in in my heart
[1:28:20] my heart of hearts I'm sorry
[1:28:23] Once Upon a Time
[1:28:25] I did say something and it was probably
[1:28:27] an immaturity
[1:28:30] but I think I I bear the results of it
[1:28:32] now and I truly am sorry for it
[1:28:36] I said
[1:28:38] we're going to have a prayer meeting on
[1:28:39] Thursday night
[1:28:41] and if you don't want to come we don't
[1:28:42] want you there anyways
[1:28:44] people got offended by that
[1:28:47] and I truly apologize for that
[1:28:49] because I don't want to offend anybody
[1:28:51] what I want to do is the opposite I want
[1:28:53] to encourage people
[1:28:55] and as I said out of immaturity I said
[1:28:58] that
[1:29:00] but you know brothers and sisters if we
[1:29:01] want to see more of God there's more of
[1:29:03] God to be had
[1:29:05] but the only way we're going to get it
[1:29:06] is to Humble ourselves in the sight of
[1:29:08] the Lord and He will lift us up
[1:29:11] and you know on Thursday night we read a
[1:29:13] scripture
[1:29:14] the chapter actually Psalms 86 maybe you
[1:29:17] want to bookmark that and just read it
[1:29:20] later we could read it now but I think
[1:29:22] it maybe we'll read it tonight or
[1:29:24] something I don't know Psalms chapter 86
[1:29:27] I would say that let that be my prayer
[1:29:29] but you know brothers and sisters we
[1:29:31] we've we've got to be willing to put God
[1:29:34] before everything in our lives
[1:29:37] and not say there's anything before God
[1:29:39] in our lives because we know what the
[1:29:41] word says about that if there's anything
[1:29:43] in our lives that comes before God it's
[1:29:45] idolatry and that's what the word says
[1:29:48] that's what the prophet says
[1:29:51] talking about a prayer meeting
[1:29:53] Brother Brad I mean he says this quote
[1:29:55] and I just want to read it I read it on
[1:29:57] Thursday evening I just think it's
[1:29:59] important brothers and sisters
[1:30:00] remembering contrite remembering a
[1:30:02] humble heart remembering a broken Spirit
[1:30:04] that's what David had many times we look
[1:30:06] at David and say he was the mighty king
[1:30:07] he was a mighty warrior but look at his
[1:30:09] heart
[1:30:10] he had scars man he was broken he was
[1:30:14] bruised for our iniquity
[1:30:18] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:30:20] him
[1:30:21] I'm not saying by his stripes we were
[1:30:23] healed but I am saying that he was a
[1:30:26] type of Christ
[1:30:27] David was a type of Christ
[1:30:29] if we want to see a different result in
[1:30:30] our lives maybe we need to do something
[1:30:32] a little different greater than Solomon
[1:30:35] is here in 1962 brother Branham says and
[1:30:37] then people stay home from prayer
[1:30:38] meeting
[1:30:39] it shows where their heart's at
[1:30:42] that's the reason there can't be a
[1:30:44] Revival
[1:30:45] that's right
[1:30:48] he says however that's your pastor's
[1:30:50] Place see and so I I guess I find myself
[1:30:53] there saying that and that's why I don't
[1:30:55] really want to say it but I I just
[1:30:57] believe what the prophet said he said
[1:31:00] see he tells you that listen I'm just
[1:31:02] telling you too so you'll know my part
[1:31:04] believe it too
[1:31:06] I believe the same thing yes sir oh God
[1:31:08] what we need is a Revival
[1:31:11] coming all the way from the pulpit
[1:31:14] to the janitor
[1:31:16] Stir It Up an old-fashioned backwards
[1:31:19] backwards blue sky blue God sent
[1:31:22] Pentecostal Revival that's right
[1:31:26] brothers and sisters this is where it
[1:31:28] really gets important for us to
[1:31:29] recognize he says this
[1:31:32] not
[1:31:33] not whitewashed
[1:31:35] but washed White
[1:31:38] not whitewashed not just outward apparel
[1:31:41] adorning good message Behavior I I come
[1:31:44] to church I pay my tithes I'm a member I
[1:31:46] I have lots of friends no
[1:31:48] not whitewashed but washed white that's
[1:31:51] right not saying talk about the glory of
[1:31:54] God but the glory of God revealing the
[1:31:56] glory of God that's what we need in the
[1:31:59] church today
[1:32:01] I just wanted to say that brothers and
[1:32:03] sisters if we want to see more of God
[1:32:04] there's more of God to be seen there's
[1:32:07] more of God to be had if we have things
[1:32:09] in our life struggles that are going on
[1:32:11] that we're silently fighting through
[1:32:13] come together confess your faults one to
[1:32:16] another and pray one for another that ye
[1:32:19] may be healed
[1:32:20] we don't have to just fight the battles
[1:32:22] on our own
[1:32:23] we don't have to do that brothers and
[1:32:25] sisters
[1:32:26] that's what the body of Christ is for
[1:32:29] getting back to our thought today
[1:32:30] talking about being contrite David
[1:32:34] recognizing that you know we can do
[1:32:36] things in secret we can do things in
[1:32:38] private but God nothing is hidden from
[1:32:41] him he sees everything that goes on he
[1:32:44] knows our every thought he sees our
[1:32:46] every action every single thing that
[1:32:49] happens and you know I love how brother
[1:32:50] Branham says it too in the message he'll
[1:32:52] say it that he knows even your thoughts
[1:32:54] right now right now he knows our
[1:32:56] thoughts what we're thinking what's in
[1:32:58] our hearts do we have a contrite heart a
[1:33:01] humble Spirit willing to be led of the
[1:33:03] Holy Ghost or is there some resistance
[1:33:05] saying brother Barry that's not the way
[1:33:06] that I've learned it that's not the way
[1:33:08] that my pastor taught me that's not what
[1:33:09] I was taught by my parents you know I
[1:33:12] don't know if it was or it wasn't I know
[1:33:13] it wasn't what I was taught but I know
[1:33:15] that I've actually been able to hear the
[1:33:17] word of God and I know that his word is
[1:33:19] true I can only say what the Lord has
[1:33:22] shown me
[1:33:23] according to the message of the hour
[1:33:25] contrite out of the seven Church ages
[1:33:28] 1954 you can get forgiveness for
[1:33:30] crucifying Jesus you can get forgiveness
[1:33:32] for taking his name in vain but who
[1:33:34] speaks against the Holy Ghost will never
[1:33:36] be forgiven him in this world or the
[1:33:38] world to come we're in the last day so
[1:33:40] be careful walked humbly have a contrite
[1:33:43] broken Spirit a humble heart willing to
[1:33:45] let the Holy Spirit Lead You amen you
[1:33:47] know we are talking about it this
[1:33:48] morning in the Bible study that there's
[1:33:50] two unpardonable sins and we have heard
[1:33:53] it many times that there's one and we
[1:33:55] all know that that's blaspheming right
[1:33:57] that's true there's another one and that
[1:33:59] one is unforgiveness brothers and
[1:34:01] sisters unforgiveness because as we
[1:34:04] forgive we will be forgiven if we're
[1:34:06] hanging on to something that we're not
[1:34:07] forgiving someone for then we won't be
[1:34:09] forgiven ourselves
[1:34:11] that portion is going to be refrained
[1:34:13] from us and you know I I know this is
[1:34:15] where we're getting down to the
[1:34:16] nitty-gritty this is where we really get
[1:34:18] into where it starts to hurt people but
[1:34:20] brothers and sisters we're not allowed
[1:34:22] to have unforgiveness in our hearts
[1:34:24] we're just not we have got to be willing
[1:34:27] to let go of all of the things in our
[1:34:29] lives there can't be anything holding
[1:34:31] back the spirit of God and you know many
[1:34:33] times we can look at it and say well
[1:34:35] back in the day so and so did such and
[1:34:37] such to me or so and so did such and
[1:34:39] such to so and so maybe our parents got
[1:34:42] hurt maybe our brother or our sister got
[1:34:44] hurt maybe a cousin or a friend got hurt
[1:34:46] maybe something happened in the church
[1:34:49] who knows what happened Satan will use
[1:34:51] any manner of things better yet God will
[1:34:54] allow any manner of things to happen so
[1:34:57] that circumstances will come to pass to
[1:35:00] prove Who We Are
[1:35:01] but brothers and sisters we can't hold
[1:35:03] on to nothing and you know if we've got
[1:35:05] hurt in our lives we have got to go back
[1:35:07] to where that hurt lies and uncover it
[1:35:10] and deal with it properly by giving
[1:35:13] forgiveness and then moving on
[1:35:16] and as long as we don't do that we give
[1:35:18] Satan an opportunity to be there in our
[1:35:20] lives we give that resistance to be
[1:35:22] there in our lives and that will quash
[1:35:24] the the benefit of a spirit that will
[1:35:26] quash the benefit of a prayer meeting
[1:35:28] that will quash the benefit of anything
[1:35:30] that could happen in terms of the Lord
[1:35:32] blessing our lives I'm not saying it
[1:35:34] will all the time but it certainly could
[1:35:36] and you know what's worse brother
[1:35:38] Branham says that if we have something
[1:35:39] that we drag into a service we could
[1:35:41] actually potentially Rob someone else of
[1:35:43] their blessing who on Earth would want
[1:35:45] to do that brothers and sisters
[1:35:47] if we've got something in our lives that
[1:35:50] goes way back and it's deep down just
[1:35:52] deal with it
[1:35:54] I'm not talking about a psychological
[1:35:55] thing I'm just talking about dealing
[1:35:57] with the root cause of the problem
[1:35:58] recognizing that it's a devil hiding
[1:36:01] there in your life
[1:36:03] and you've got the ability according to
[1:36:04] the word for your day to deal with it
[1:36:07] because if we submit ourselves therefore
[1:36:09] unto God resist the devil then he will
[1:36:12] flee from us
[1:36:14] but first we've got to recognize what it
[1:36:16] is we've got to go go and take a look
[1:36:18] sometimes and you know brothers and
[1:36:20] sisters we were we were having a
[1:36:22] conversation and I just I just think we
[1:36:24] can only be honest about this stuff how
[1:36:26] important it is to recognize that we can
[1:36:29] actually be holding on to things in our
[1:36:31] lives where you know maybe we have got
[1:36:33] forgiveness for everyone around us but
[1:36:36] something happened in our lives that
[1:36:37] just didn't seem fair and what can
[1:36:39] happen is we can have resentment to God
[1:36:42] we can have something in our lives where
[1:36:44] maybe we just don't think that that was
[1:36:47] fair that God allowed that to happen to
[1:36:48] me in my life
[1:36:50] and you know what's worse sometimes we
[1:36:53] can do things and even say that we don't
[1:36:55] forgive ourselves
[1:36:57] but as we're forgiven as we forgive
[1:36:59] we'll be forgiven can we forgive
[1:37:01] ourselves can we forgive God things will
[1:37:05] happen he'll allow us to get to a place
[1:37:07] so that we can have a contrite heart so
[1:37:09] that we can have a humble Spirit broken
[1:37:12] not our own will but his will
[1:37:15] because you know what just like David
[1:37:17] never climbed his way to the throne we
[1:37:19] ain't climbing our way to the throne The
[1:37:21] Only Way Up Is Down brothers and sisters
[1:37:23] and we know that to be the truth
[1:37:24] according to the message of the hour the
[1:37:26] only way up is down and the only way
[1:37:29] we're going to get down is to recognize
[1:37:31] that we have nothing on our own to bring
[1:37:33] we know that we are not saved through
[1:37:36] anything that we have done
[1:37:39] it's only a free gift from God
[1:37:43] out of the Seal of God in 1954. well did
[1:37:46] you ever see a Railroader loading the
[1:37:48] cars
[1:37:50] he will go out and he will set so much
[1:37:53] here and so much here
[1:37:55] the inspector comes by he looks in
[1:37:59] and if this is a little loose he shakes
[1:38:01] it
[1:38:02] nope I won't seal it
[1:38:04] got to tear it out and do it over again
[1:38:07] next thing he will try to load it again
[1:38:10] he will get this wrong
[1:38:13] the inspector will come by
[1:38:15] wrong
[1:38:16] do it over again
[1:38:18] and that's what God's been doing with
[1:38:20] his church for a long time
[1:38:23] and you know I'll say it brothers and
[1:38:25] sisters
[1:38:26] even today that's what God's doing with
[1:38:29] brother Barry
[1:38:31] how about you
[1:38:32] there's things in our lives that he
[1:38:34] wants fixed up he wants packed properly
[1:38:36] and the reason for it is it's got a
[1:38:39] journey to take and if we don't have it
[1:38:41] packed up right it's not going to wind
[1:38:43] up at the Final Destination
[1:38:45] but what we need to do is make sure that
[1:38:47] we get it right get it packed in
[1:38:49] properly
[1:38:50] the inspector comes by looks in and if
[1:38:53] if he sees that it's a little loose it
[1:38:55] shakes nope I won't seal it he says
[1:38:57] gotta tear it out and do it over again
[1:39:00] next thing he'll try to load it again he
[1:39:03] will get this wrong the inspector will
[1:39:05] come by wrong do it over again and
[1:39:07] that's what God's been doing with his
[1:39:09] church for a long time you load it up
[1:39:11] and you're going to heaven you're going
[1:39:13] to take everything with you
[1:39:15] your card games huh and I'm going to
[1:39:18] pause there and say whatever else take
[1:39:20] the card games out and say whatever else
[1:39:22] brothers and sisters maybe it's movies
[1:39:24] maybe it's magazines maybe it's social
[1:39:26] media maybe it's your job maybe it's
[1:39:29] your business maybe it's whatever it is
[1:39:31] it could even be your family it could
[1:39:33] even be your church whatever it is
[1:39:35] if you're putting it before God he's
[1:39:38] going to come by and take a look and
[1:39:39] he's going to shake it up and say nope
[1:39:41] I'll be back around time to just go
[1:39:44] through this trial just a little longer
[1:39:45] just a little another round on the
[1:39:47] merry-go-round
[1:39:49] he says you load up and you're going to
[1:39:50] heaven you're going to take everything
[1:39:52] with you your card games huh every other
[1:39:54] thing that you can load into the church
[1:39:57] you're trying to take it with you
[1:39:59] God just condemns it ain't ready for
[1:40:02] sealing
[1:40:04] but here we go brothers and sisters
[1:40:07] this is where it gets hard or whether it
[1:40:09] gets good I don't know what it is I
[1:40:12] don't know where we're at today I can
[1:40:14] only follow leadership of the Lord like
[1:40:15] I said this this kind of blows my mind
[1:40:17] when he does it this way he goes on to
[1:40:19] say but when God sees a man contrite
[1:40:22] broken Spirit sincere in heart down at
[1:40:26] the altar God closes the door of the
[1:40:29] world to him and seals him in there by
[1:40:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:35] I just can't and express the importance
[1:40:38] of that brothers and sisters how we need
[1:40:40] to be that that willing it doesn't
[1:40:42] matter who's looking it doesn't matter
[1:40:44] what's going on in our lives doesn't
[1:40:46] matter what we think or feel on our own
[1:40:48] we've got to be willing to get down to
[1:40:50] the altar to have an old-fashioned sin
[1:40:53] killing Revival
[1:40:54] we've got to be willing to have a
[1:40:56] contrite heart a broken spirit and until
[1:40:59] we're willing to get there God's going
[1:41:01] to just keep allowing the trials to keep
[1:41:03] squishing us and as long as we don't
[1:41:05] surrender Our Lives to his will that's
[1:41:07] what will happen
[1:41:09] but when God sees a man contrite broken
[1:41:11] Spirit sincere and heart down at the
[1:41:13] altar God closes the door of the world
[1:41:15] to him and seals him in there by the
[1:41:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and here's the
[1:41:20] beautiful part for the sisters that are
[1:41:22] getting baptized today this is for you I
[1:41:25] would say and everyone else but I think
[1:41:27] it's so important to recognize it he
[1:41:29] seals him in there by the baptism of the
[1:41:31] Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus
[1:41:33] comes
[1:41:34] not from one Revival to the other but
[1:41:37] until the day of your Redemption
[1:41:41] we're not up one day and down the next
[1:41:44] we're not saved today and lost tomorrow
[1:41:46] and maybe in between the week following
[1:41:49] brothers and sisters we've got reason to
[1:41:51] Rejoice if we've got the baptism of the
[1:41:53] Holy Ghost we're sealed till the day of
[1:41:55] our Redemption
[1:41:57] and remember it's not because you don't
[1:42:00] have trials you're going to have trials
[1:42:02] the trials are coming our way
[1:42:05] and you know we were talking about this
[1:42:07] too I hope it's okay
[1:42:09] what it means to grow up in the message
[1:42:10] and be a message believer
[1:42:13] and and to actually not have maybe that
[1:42:15] that lightning bolt experience maybe
[1:42:18] like I can say that I had I came to a
[1:42:20] service on a Wednesday evening and I was
[1:42:22] an alcoholic and I was a smoker and I
[1:42:25] had all manner of other things going on
[1:42:26] in my life but I knew I hungered and I
[1:42:29] thirsted for righteousness and in a
[1:42:31] moment there was a lightning bolt and it
[1:42:33] was silent there was no sensation there
[1:42:35] was no lightning there was no Thunder
[1:42:37] there was nothing there was just a
[1:42:38] broken heart there was a contrite spirit
[1:42:40] there was one willing to be led by the
[1:42:42] holy ghost that said hey Lord if you're
[1:42:44] God I'll take you at your word be it
[1:42:46] unto me according to Thy word that's all
[1:42:48] it was and when that happened brothers
[1:42:49] and sisters it changed my life forever
[1:42:54] forever
[1:42:56] but when you grow up in the message and
[1:42:58] you're fed Eagles food all the time
[1:43:01] many times it can be very difficult to
[1:43:04] discern
[1:43:05] when that's happened in your life how
[1:43:08] how has my life changed I I haven't
[1:43:10] started smoking and quit smoking I
[1:43:13] haven't started drinking and quit
[1:43:14] drinking I haven't been out in the world
[1:43:16] carousing and then now I'm not carousing
[1:43:18] I I just have grown up and I've eaten
[1:43:20] this at the king's table every day of my
[1:43:23] life and that's all I know how do I know
[1:43:25] I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:27] can you receive the word for your day
[1:43:28] does it does it stir you does it make
[1:43:31] you say amen that's the evidence of it
[1:43:34] but you know the beautiful part brothers
[1:43:36] and sisters this is what I want to say
[1:43:38] Don't Be Afraid don't think that because
[1:43:40] you you go on and you get the Holy Ghost
[1:43:43] in your life that that's when the trials
[1:43:44] start even though they do start
[1:43:47] you know what's going to happen is
[1:43:48] everyone is going to have trials in
[1:43:50] their lives
[1:43:52] wouldn't it be good to have the Holy
[1:43:54] Ghost in your life for your trials
[1:43:56] wouldn't it be good to know that you
[1:43:58] have the Lord to back you up as the
[1:44:00] prophet for our day said that I've got
[1:44:02] all of Heaven backing waiting to back up
[1:44:04] my words when when she speaks he speaks
[1:44:08] he's just waiting with all of his
[1:44:10] millions and millions of angels for your
[1:44:13] voice
[1:44:13] the spoken word condition to hear us
[1:44:16] speak
[1:44:17] I I just think it's an incredible
[1:44:19] thought you know brothers and sisters we
[1:44:20] don't have to live in fear and think
[1:44:21] that just because we get the baptism of
[1:44:23] the Holy Spirit that's when our trials
[1:44:24] are going to start our trials actually
[1:44:26] are going to become Victorious at that
[1:44:28] point that's what's going to happen
[1:44:29] we're still going to have trials we've
[1:44:31] heard it said many times you're going to
[1:44:32] fight your way to go to heaven you're
[1:44:34] going to fight your way to go to hell
[1:44:35] you're going to fight every inch of the
[1:44:37] way in this life that's the way this
[1:44:38] life is created it's it's a battle God
[1:44:41] has created it and we know the battle
[1:44:42] started in heaven and it was between
[1:44:44] Lucifer and God Lucifer and Michael
[1:44:46] Lucifer and Jesus however you want to
[1:44:48] call it it started there but he's
[1:44:50] brought it down to earth to finish it
[1:44:51] and he's going to finish it in his bride
[1:44:53] his bride is going to be the one that
[1:44:55] will say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:44:56] word and not be shaken from it
[1:44:59] brother Branham says when that boxcar
[1:45:01] door is closed and the government seal
[1:45:04] put on it it cannot be open no more
[1:45:07] until it reaches its final destination
[1:45:10] and every man that's born again and
[1:45:12] sealed into the kingdom of God has no
[1:45:15] more desire of the world until the day
[1:45:19] Jesus Christ takes him into the kingdom
[1:45:24] isn't that wonderful to think about
[1:45:25] brothers and sisters you know we've said
[1:45:28] it many times and I want to say it again
[1:45:29] because we're all humans living in this
[1:45:31] flesh fighting the same enemy we're and
[1:45:33] then that enemy is ourselves remember we
[1:45:35] said it I think at the men's meeting we
[1:45:37] have a thorn in the flesh Paul had a
[1:45:39] thorn in the flesh but that thorn in our
[1:45:41] flesh is our flesh
[1:45:43] you can't see the real me and I can't
[1:45:45] see the real you this is just what we've
[1:45:47] been given to live in we've bypassed our
[1:45:49] theophonies we've come down here to be
[1:45:51] tried tested and proved that we truly
[1:45:54] are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:45:56] but when we're sealed into the kingdom
[1:45:57] of God we have no more desire of the
[1:46:00] world until the day Jesus Christ takes
[1:46:02] us into his kingdom
[1:46:04] right now we can look back in our lives
[1:46:07] even the kids that were raised in the
[1:46:08] message of the hour if you truly are
[1:46:10] baptized and you truly have an Earnest
[1:46:13] desire for the holy ghost in your life
[1:46:14] you might not be who you want to be that
[1:46:17] perfect image of your theophany and
[1:46:19] likely you never will be here on this
[1:46:21] side of Eternity but you can look back
[1:46:23] and say you know what some of those
[1:46:24] desires that I had in my life because of
[1:46:26] my Earnest desire to have a contrite
[1:46:28] heart and a broken spirit and willing to
[1:46:30] be led by the Holy Ghost because of that
[1:46:32] I can look back and say you know what I
[1:46:34] don't live like I used to those things
[1:46:36] that I used to desire I don't desire
[1:46:37] them anymore maybe I'm struggling right
[1:46:39] now but God's given me that struggle to
[1:46:41] prove himself through me so that he can
[1:46:43] see me as an overcomer and better yet
[1:46:46] brothers and sisters so that you can see
[1:46:47] you as an overcomer just like Abraham
[1:46:50] was given that test to bring Isaac to
[1:46:51] the top of the mountain it wasn't so God
[1:46:53] would know now I love you Abraham it was
[1:46:55] so that Abraham would know that I love
[1:46:57] God with all of my heart and I won't
[1:46:59] hold nothing back from him
[1:47:01] when that boxcar door is closed and the
[1:47:04] government seal is put on and it cannot
[1:47:05] be open no more until it reaches its
[1:47:08] final destination and every man that's
[1:47:10] born again and sealed into the kingdom
[1:47:11] of God has no more desire of the world
[1:47:13] until the day Jesus Christ takes him
[1:47:16] into the Kingdom so if you're having
[1:47:19] trouble and saying you got the Holy
[1:47:22] Ghost whether you belong to the
[1:47:23] Methodist Church the Baptist Church the
[1:47:25] Pentecostal Church you know what brother

[1:47:31] forward backwards sprinkled if you're
[1:47:34] still having them kinds of troubles

[1:47:41] have a broken Spirit be willing to be
[1:47:44] led of the Holy Ghost don't care who's

[1:47:49] make it right with the Lord and He will
[1:47:51] meet you there brothers and sisters and
[1:47:53] you don't have to come here to the
[1:47:54] stairs and and and cry even though a new
[1:47:57] birth is a mess you can do it in your
[1:47:58] seat you can do it in your car you can
[1:48:00] do it in your house it doesn't matter
[1:48:01] where just do it get into the boat while
[1:48:04] there's still time
[1:48:06] whether you belong to the Methodist
[1:48:08] Church Baptist Church Pentecostal Church
[1:48:10] whether you shouted spoke with tongues
[1:48:11] baptized forwards backwards sprinkled if
[1:48:13] you're still having them kinds of
[1:48:15] troubles you'd better come back and
[1:48:17] check up the load that's right take too
[1:48:19] much with you it's too loose shaking God
[1:48:22] won't seal it that way we need to know
[1:48:25] that all that can be shaken will be
[1:48:27] shaken brothers and sisters and that's
[1:48:29] the age that we live in all that can be
[1:48:31] shaken will be shaken we need to make
[1:48:33] sure we recognize that that's why we
[1:48:35] have to be rooted and grounded in love
[1:48:37] got to make sure that we know where we
[1:48:39] stand that we're not pointing fingers at
[1:48:41] people we're pointing fingers at
[1:48:42] ourselves saying Lord help me feed unto
[1:48:46] me according to Thy word don't be it
[1:48:48] unto them according to Thy Word
[1:48:50] be it unto me
[1:48:52] why
[1:48:56] the contrite spirit out of the Seal of
[1:48:58] God
[1:48:59] he goes on to say what we need tonight
[1:49:02] is a lot of this here Hollywood
[1:49:04] evangelism choked down
[1:49:07] in an old-fashioned God sent Revival
[1:49:10] men and women who get down at the altar
[1:49:14] and quit this shaking hands
[1:49:16] and holding up hands and sprinkling them
[1:49:19] baptizing Face Forward backwards and all
[1:49:21] these other little forms and isms
[1:49:24] and get down to a real contrite
[1:49:27] broken Spirit where sin is
[1:49:30] he says mix that together
[1:49:33] and start an old-fashioned crying out
[1:49:36] of a newborn child amen
[1:49:40] he says that's the kind that gets the
[1:49:41] Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] that's right
[1:49:45] not the kind that says everything is all
[1:49:48] right and everything is perfect in my
[1:49:50] life
[1:49:50] and you know brothers and sisters I want
[1:49:52] to say this I don't want to make a
[1:49:54] Hollywood religion I don't want to make
[1:49:56] an act
[1:49:57] but what I do want to do is encourage
[1:49:59] every one of us to not worry about what
[1:50:01] anyone's thinking worry about what God's
[1:50:03] thinking because there's nothing that we
[1:50:05] hide from God and if we're not willing
[1:50:07] to make it right before God he will make
[1:50:10] sure that it is exposed before the sun
[1:50:12] before the sun it will be very much
[1:50:15] apparent what's going on in our lives if
[1:50:17] we're not willing to make it right he
[1:50:19] says that's the kind that gets the Holy
[1:50:21] Ghost that's right and I want to say
[1:50:22] this that's what children need to see
[1:50:24] children need to witness a new birth
[1:50:27] children don't need to witness formalism
[1:50:30] and starchiness I'm a Canadian like
[1:50:32] brother Cadre would say I'm a Canadian
[1:50:34] so I can't say Amen or I can't get
[1:50:37] excited about the word brothers and
[1:50:38] sisters if something like this word
[1:50:40] doesn't get us excited what's going to
[1:50:41] do it
[1:50:43] is it is it a sports game somewhere is
[1:50:46] it is it some kind of a a an
[1:50:48] entertainment somewhere that's going to
[1:50:50] get us excited we know brother Branham
[1:50:51] says this is the quietest place we're
[1:50:53] going to live
[1:50:55] I'm not looking for radicalism I'm not
[1:50:57] looking for people to put it on but what
[1:50:58] I am looking for is real we want to make
[1:51:01] sure that we're real be real don't worry
[1:51:04] about what anybody thinks brothers and
[1:51:06] sisters worry about what he thinks is
[1:51:08] our heart contrite is our heart right do
[1:51:10] we have a broken heart a broken humble
[1:51:12] spirit before God you know what if we do
[1:51:15] brothers and sisters we're going to have
[1:51:17] it before our brothers and our sisters
[1:51:19] we're not just gonna say I've got it
[1:51:21] and that's all we need to do no no no no
[1:51:23] no no no no we're actually gonna live it
[1:51:25] it's going to be displayed in our lives
[1:51:27] We're not gonna say oh that brother this
[1:51:30] or oh that sister that or oh brother
[1:51:32] Barry or whatever it is We're not gonna
[1:51:34] do that you know what that is brothers
[1:51:35] and sisters that's absalom's Camp that's
[1:51:38] the group of people that hung out with
[1:51:40] Absalom that had the Insurrection that
[1:51:42] wanted to come up and take the kingdom
[1:51:43] we know that Satan's kingdom
[1:51:46] Believers are going to say nope I don't
[1:51:48] believe that about that brother and I'm
[1:51:50] not even interested in talking about it
[1:51:51] because that brother's not that way I
[1:51:53] know that he actually didn't mean it
[1:51:54] even if he said it and the same thing
[1:51:56] with that sister because they're
[1:51:58] children of God they're Children of the
[1:51:59] most high God that's the Lord Jesus
[1:52:01] Christ bride and you know what happens
[1:52:03] when we do that brothers and sisters if
[1:52:04] that person is out of order if they
[1:52:06] really are truly pretending false
[1:52:08] pretending God will expose it won't he
[1:52:11] there'll be a shooting star they'll burn
[1:52:13] really bright and then they'll just
[1:52:15] disappear poof right
[1:52:17] but if they're truly a son and daughter
[1:52:19] of God oh my far be it for me for us to
[1:52:22] speak anything against them my goodness
[1:52:25] Brother Brad I'm talking about it he
[1:52:27] says mix that together start an
[1:52:28] old-fashioned crying out of a newborn
[1:52:30] child amen that's the kind that gets the
[1:52:32] Holy Ghost that's right no matter
[1:52:34] whether you're a Methodist Baptist or
[1:52:36] Catholic or whatever they are
[1:52:38] when they get before the Altar and cry
[1:52:42] day and night oh Lord look at the sins
[1:52:45] of this city
[1:52:47] my heart can't rest I can't rest Lord to
[1:52:51] see the things going on oh God do
[1:52:53] something
[1:52:55] how many people cry and sigh for the
[1:52:58] Abominations in the City of Calgary
[1:53:02] remember brother Branham talked about it
[1:53:05] looking over the City I believe of
[1:53:07] Phoenix
[1:53:10] Somewhere in Arizona I might be getting
[1:53:11] it wrong
[1:53:13] sitting up on the hill
[1:53:15] where the coyotes used to be looking
[1:53:17] down on the city and thinking about how
[1:53:19] many adulteries are going to be
[1:53:20] committed in that City that night how
[1:53:23] many people are going to go and drink
[1:53:25] strong drink in that City that night how
[1:53:28] many different sins how many times the
[1:53:30] name of the Lord is going to be taken in
[1:53:32] vain all of the sins in that City back
[1:53:35] in the 60s I think that was in 62 or
[1:53:37] three
[1:53:38] or later maybe 64-65 where are we at
[1:53:42] today brothers and sisters how much of
[1:53:44] that's going to happen here in this city
[1:53:46] tonight are we actually looking at this
[1:53:48] city and sighing and crying for the
[1:53:50] Abominations that are happening here
[1:53:52] bye brother Branham goes on to say send
[1:53:55] us an old-fashioned Revival
[1:53:57] you're on the borderline of getting the
[1:53:59] Holy Ghost then brother
[1:54:01] but if you walk up there
[1:54:03] because you've jumped up or down
[1:54:06] or because you've danced with the music
[1:54:08] or because you've done something else
[1:54:10] and walked around and blowing up and
[1:54:13] unconcerned
[1:54:15] and pouting
[1:54:16] and fussing
[1:54:18] and church joining and jumping from
[1:54:20] place to place
[1:54:22] it shows you never got nothing in the
[1:54:24] beginning
[1:54:26] he says brother
[1:54:28] that's good strong medicine
[1:54:31] but it'll sure fix you up that's right
[1:54:34] yes sir
[1:54:35] it'll bring you out
[1:54:37] without a feeble one among you
[1:54:40] brothers and sisters this morning
[1:54:43] I didn't want to really go this way with
[1:54:46] it but I just can't help but trust the
[1:54:48] Lord when he shows me things
[1:54:50] we want to make sure that we have the
[1:54:52] right Spirit we want to make sure that
[1:54:54] we're in our right position brothers and
[1:54:56] sisters
[1:54:57] going forwards and conquering the land
[1:55:00] like Joshua that's what we want to do
[1:55:03] but where are we at in our own personal
[1:55:05] lives
[1:55:06] are we Conquering the land according to
[1:55:08] the word as husbands should be in our
[1:55:10] home
[1:55:11] and wives are we Conquering the land
[1:55:13] according to the word
[1:55:14] in our home in our marriages children
[1:55:16] are we obeying our parents
[1:55:19] in our homes
[1:55:20] that's conquering our lands brothers and
[1:55:22] sisters
[1:55:23] we're not just looking for Devils to be
[1:55:25] slayed that will happen all that stuff
[1:55:28] just follows but getting into our
[1:55:30] position is really getting into our
[1:55:32] position according to the word and until
[1:55:34] we get into our position according to
[1:55:35] the word I don't know are we really in
[1:55:38] our position I don't think so I think we
[1:55:40] want to be
[1:55:42] you know brother Branham he says it
[1:55:46] if you've walked up there because you've
[1:55:47] jumped up or down I'm going to call the
[1:55:49] musicians and and close early today
[1:55:50] because we're going to baptize and and
[1:55:52] we got a service tonight
[1:55:54] but if you walk up there because you've
[1:55:56] jumped up or down or because you've
[1:55:58] danced with music or because you've done
[1:56:00] something else
[1:56:02] and walked around and blowing up and
[1:56:04] unconcerned and pouting and fussing
[1:56:09] I just can't help but think you know
[1:56:11] what the Lord he gave us the word to
[1:56:13] deal with things
[1:56:15] but people pout and people fuss
[1:56:18] Church joining and jumping from place to
[1:56:20] place it shows you never got nothing in
[1:56:22] the beginning brother that strong
[1:56:24] medicine
[1:56:25] but it'll sure fix you up
[1:56:27] we need to make sure brothers and
[1:56:28] sisters that we've got the right Spirit
[1:56:30] his spirit is going to be a contrite
[1:56:32] spirit it's going to be a broken heart

[1:56:36] to be led by the Lord by the Holy Ghost
