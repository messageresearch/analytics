[1:38:51] it and out set the Egyptians against
[1:38:55] Egyptians and they shall fight everyone
[1:38:58] against his brother and everyone against
[1:39:01] his neighbor City against City and
[1:39:05] Kingdom against Kingdom the spirit of

[1:39:56] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:39:59] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:40:04] The Obedience of Christ and
[1:40:07] having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[1:40:11] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:40:15] fulfilled let's go to uh uh

[1:40:45] uh verse um uh and listen to the uh
[1:40:49] children of Israel murmuring and
[1:40:51] complaining now
[1:40:54] is not this the word the word that we
[1:40:56] did tell the the in Egypt saying let us
[1:41:00] alone that we may save the
[1:41:03] Egyptians for it had been better for us
[1:41:06] to save the Egyptians than that we
[1:41:09] should die in the
[1:41:11] wilderness Moses responded here and
[1:41:14] Moses said unto the people fear not
[1:41:17] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:41:21] Lord which he will to you today for the
[1:41:27] Egyptians whom you have seen
[1:41:30] today you shall see them again no more

[1:41:37] you and you shall be at PE you shall
[1:41:40] hold your
[1:41:41] peace

[1:41:46] morning watch the Lord looked unto the
[1:41:48] host of Egyptians through the pillar of
[1:41:51] fire how many believe that the pillar of
[1:41:53] fire is still
[1:41:57] here and of the cloud and troubled the
[1:42:00] host of the
[1:42:02] Egyptians other versions say
[1:42:07] confused the host of the Egyptians and
[1:42:09] took off their chariot wheels that they
[1:42:12] drove them heavily so that the Egyptians
[1:42:15] said let us flee from the uh place of
[1:42:18] Israel from the face of Israel for the
[1:42:21] Lord fighteth for them and against the
[1:42:23] Egyptians amen may the Lord add blessing
[1:42:27] to the reading of his word we may take
[1:42:29] our seats uh May our hearts be blessed

[1:42:36] to EMAs that did not our hearts burn
[1:42:39] within us as he spoke to us on the word
[1:42:42] I believe uh our God is not just the god
[1:42:45] of the elderly I I I believe he not just
[1:42:48] the O the god of the mothers the fathers
[1:42:51] he's also the god of the children
[1:42:54] I believe he's a personal God this

[1:42:59] through whether you're a child whether
[1:43:00] you're middle age whether you're elderly

[1:43:05] way and at a personal level you love the

[1:43:12] church is already on fire it reminds me
[1:43:14] of back home already and and I love a
[1:43:17] church that's on fire for the Living God
[1:43:20] brother Brenham says God hats a
[1:43:23] powerless
[1:43:25] religion and we are not a powerless
[1:43:27] people we are not a a fearful people the

[1:43:58] is total
[1:44:00] confusion in the camp of your
[1:44:03] enemies I pray that by the end of this
[1:44:06] service there would be total confusion
[1:44:09] in the camp of your enemies this morning
[1:44:13] and I don't care what enemy you have but
[1:44:16] that enemy is under your feet as a
[1:44:19] Christian you believe that this morning
[1:44:22] that our God is more than able to
[1:44:24] deliver you he's more than able to give
[1:44:27] you your heart's desire this morning
[1:44:29] he's more than able to drive out all
[1:44:32] those demons that are bothering you and
[1:44:34] your
[1:44:35] children total confusion in the camp of
[1:44:38] your enemy the Bible says I'll make
[1:44:40] Egyptians fight against Egyptians I'll
[1:44:43] make your enemies fight against each
[1:44:45] other may I say this my brother if the
[1:44:48] enemy is trying to get at you to today

[1:45:35] one on the increase right now is mental
[1:45:38] illness and I pray that we have not been
[1:45:41] given that kind of a spirit the Bible
[1:45:44] says we've been given the spirit of
[1:45:46] boldness and of love and of a sound mind

[1:49:35] belong to you my brother amen during the
[1:49:37] Old Testament in the Old
[1:49:39] Testament think about it for a
[1:49:42] moment the blessings didn't belong to
[1:49:45] the
[1:49:47] Canaanites blessings didn't belong to
[1:49:49] the Philistines either or the jebusites
[1:49:52] the blessings belonged to
[1:49:55] Israel and we are the spiritual Israel
[1:49:57] today why should blessings belong
[1:50:00] outside there we need the blessings of
[1:50:02] the Lord here
[1:50:04] today the Bible says I would that you
[1:50:08] prosper physically and
[1:50:10] spiritually you don't have to die of a

[1:50:58] discernment they're talking about a
[1:51:00] prophet of God that's been Vindicated
[1:51:03] Beyond The Shadow of Doubt there's
[1:51:05] nobody we can ever compare with in this

[2:27:42] bit about
[2:27:45] running when they give that baton when
[2:27:48] they line them for
[2:27:51] Runners the first one is usually the
[2:27:53] second
[2:27:55] fastest then the second and third
[2:27:58] they're not the
[2:28:00] fastest and the last one is the
[2:28:04] fastest so when they give him that
[2:28:08] second fastest has to do the best he can
[2:28:12] or she can to give to these other two
[2:28:16] that are not the
[2:28:18] fastest and the job of the the fourth
[2:28:22] Runner they call him the
[2:28:25] anchor the job of that one is two
[2:28:29] fold one is to maintain the lead if
[2:28:33] they're still
[2:28:34] leading the second is to run as fast to
[2:28:38] outrun the ones if the other two maybe

[3:21:01] side of the Red Sea and they saw that
[3:21:03] their enemy was dead how did they feel

[3:21:17] want to sing two songs let's just have a
[3:21:21] quick word of prayer before we do
