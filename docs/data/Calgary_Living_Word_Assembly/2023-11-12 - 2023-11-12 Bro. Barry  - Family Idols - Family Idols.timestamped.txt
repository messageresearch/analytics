[49:13] Genesis chapter 2 we'll start reading
[49:15] with Verse
[49:22] 18 very very familiar scripture once
[49:25] again but uh we'll just maybe take a
[49:27] little bit of a different look at it
[49:29] this
[49:30] morning Genesis 2:8 says in the Lord God
[49:34] said it's not good that man should be
[49:37] alone I will make him and help meet for
[49:40] him many times we'll say a
[49:43] helpmate that's not what the word
[49:45] says that's right it's important to make
[49:48] sure that we understand that sometimes
[49:50] we can say something over and over and
[49:52] over again a certain way and we begin to
[49:54] create a narrative in our mind mind that
[49:55] doesn't line up with the word of God
[49:57] right the wife is not just a helpmate
[50:00] she's a help meat that means able to
[50:04] look
[50:06] after and out of the ground verse 19 out
[50:09] of the ground the Lord for Lord God
[50:11] formed every beast of the field and
[50:13] every fowl of the air and brought them
[50:16] unto Adam to see what he would call
[50:19] them and whatsoever Adam called every
[50:22] living creature that was the name
[50:24] thereof amen hallelujah and Adam gave
[50:27] names to all the cattle and to the fowl
[50:29] of the air and to every beast of the
[50:31] field but for Adam there was not found
[50:34] and help meet for him and the Lord God
[50:38] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[50:41] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[50:44] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[50:47] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[50:49] from man made he a woman and brought her
[50:54] unto the man
[50:56] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[50:58] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[51:02] called woman amen because she was taken
[51:05] out of
[51:06] man therefore shall a man leave his
[51:09] father and his mother and shall cleave
[51:12] unto his wife and they shall be one
[51:14] flesh and they were both naked and the
[51:17] man and his wife and were not ashamed
[51:21] let's just bow one more
[51:23] time gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[51:25] you for your word we thank you for the
[51:27] Revelation that you've given to your
[51:30] church Lord in this age regarding your
[51:32] word father we just ask that this
[51:35] morning once again father you would help
[51:37] us to not just read between the lines
[51:39] but Lord open our hearts to receive
[51:42] Revelation further about your word Lord
[51:45] that Lord Jesus we would recognize that
[51:46] it's a living word that it's a breathing
[51:49] word that it's actually a person and
[51:51] father that we're not praying to a
[51:53] second person or a third person we're
[51:55] praying to the person the Lord Jesus
[51:57] Christ this morning we ask you we invite
[51:59] you father to take your rightful
[52:01] position in our lives and in this
[52:03] service now father as we walk with you
[52:06] along the way speak to us father we ask
[52:08] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[52:11] bless you this morning you may be
[52:15] seated certainly excited to be here once
[52:18] again thankful for the goodness of God
[52:21] in our lives Hallelujah I just love that
[52:24] song I speak Jesus amen because as a
[52:28] minister I'm sure that's what everyone
[52:30] who ever gets behind the the pulpit
[52:33] that's what we want is to speak Jesus we
[52:35] don't want to bring some new Fantastic
[52:37] some other idea we don't want to bring a
[52:40] revelation that God has given us that
[52:42] doesn't line up with the word of God we
[52:45] want to encourage the people towards
[52:48] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah just a few
[52:50] announcements before we get going today
[52:53] we have the communion service tonight
[52:56] and we have a prayer meeting on
[52:58] Thursday we have the youth meeting
[53:00] Sunday the 19th from 1: to 5 we have
[53:04] brother kre digs confirmed he's locked
[53:07] and loaded for December the 16th at 6 pm
[53:10] and December the 17th at 10:00 a.m.
[53:13] that's a Saturday evening and a Sunday
[53:15] morning we also have it confirmed with
[53:18] brother Andrew Glover and it sounds
[53:20] maybe a little bit crazy I don't really
[53:22] think I've ever done this before but we
[53:23] have him confirmed for August 16th
[53:26] August 17th and August 18th
[53:29] 2024 so if you want to put those dates
[53:32] in your calendar we actually have it
[53:34] noted on the website calendar as well
[53:37] and if there's any changes we'll
[53:38] certainly let you
[53:39] know um certainly excited to see what
[53:42] the Lord will do it's almost as though
[53:45] um you can see the evolution of of
[53:48] things at least I can anyways uh some of
[53:51] the people who were evangelists on the
[53:52] field for many many years have changed
[53:55] their positions and are not evangelizing
[53:57] So Much Anymore as pastoring um I know
[54:00] three or four evangelists many many
[54:03] years on the road evangelizing have
[54:05] become now pastors and uh that's their
[54:08] position a full-time pastor and I think
[54:11] I think it would be a tremendous uh
[54:14] tremendous schooling to be an evangelist
[54:16] for many many years and to step into the
[54:18] role of a pastor and and to know a lot
[54:20] of the things the issues the problems
[54:22] that you encounter with people and
[54:24] churches and pastors and and and
[54:26] co-pastors and deacons and all the
[54:29] stuff but you know what the Lord knows
[54:31] what we all need and uh I think it's
[54:34] just amazing to see those Brothers step
[54:35] into those roles because the the amount
[54:38] of experience they would have to be able
[54:40] to do their jobs and uh what I'm getting
[54:42] at is brother Wayne Lawson is no longer
[54:44] on the field uh traveling all over the
[54:47] world he does travel a little bit and he
[54:49] said he will still come and see us but
[54:52] probably not nearly as much as he did
[54:54] and uh
[54:55] the Lord's raised up new evangelists and
[54:57] we have you know brother Andrew Glover
[54:59] who is very similar in terms of ministry
[55:01] style and fully willing to put his
[55:04] shoulder to the wheel and come and and
[55:06] fellowship and I just think it's
[55:08] wonderful to see how the Lord moves in
[55:10] his body
[55:12] amen same thing happens with pastors and
[55:16] uh so one more thing that I want to
[55:17] mention before we get into the word is
[55:19] uh we have moved to an online uh
[55:22] directory for the church and we will
[55:25] send out details for that but it's a
[55:27] pretty uh tremendous uh little thing if
[55:31] you will uh some people are really
[55:34] adverse to change I know uh some people
[55:37] just like the paper copy they like the
[55:38] PDF copy and if that's your thing then
[55:41] we can certainly accommodate that it's
[55:42] very easy to do but for those who are
[55:45] interested it's an app and uh you'll be
[55:47] able to access all of the information
[55:50] for everyone in terms of what they want
[55:52] you to know um in the the church
[55:55] directory it's an app so uh it's online
[55:57] it's very easy to update and uh it'll be
[56:00] accessible to anyone who is a part of
[56:02] the assembly who signs in you have to
[56:05] sign in with your email and you have to
[56:08] actually create uh and register with it
[56:11] but we'll send out all the details I'll
[56:13] send it via WhatsApp for everyone who is
[56:15] interested and if you're not um please
[56:18] just let us know and we can get you a
[56:19] PDF copy as we have said so we'll have
[56:22] instructions for it and if you don't
[56:23] have a valid email address and you want
[56:26] to be a part of it please just let us
[56:27] know and we will make arrangements to
[56:30] get that to you sister Shelley Boer or
[56:33] uh my wife Lisa Johnson um can look
[56:36] after that are you happy this morning
[56:40] amen um I just got an inspiration on
[56:43] Wednesday and I just love it how the
[56:45] Lord does that today I want to talk
[56:46] about a little bit out of the exposition
[56:48] of the seven Church ages just to start
[56:51] with and uh I sent the quotes did you
[56:54] get them brother
[56:55] excellent excellent so you got the
[56:56] slides too or the pictures
[56:59] beautiful so we have uh I have two
[57:02] pictures that I'm going to show today
[57:04] just so in case you're wondering I don't
[57:06] have a formal slideshow PDF thing I'm
[57:08] I'm not there PowerPoint yet maybe one
[57:11] day but uh out of the exposition of the
[57:13] seven Church ages uh the saman church
[57:16] age we read this on Wednesday I believe
[57:19] um or maybe even last Sunday it all kind
[57:22] of Blends together after a while
[57:23] according to Romans 4:16 we find that
[57:26] God has given a sure promise to all of
[57:29] Abraham's seed amen and Paul puts
[57:32] himself and all believers under that
[57:35] designation because he says Abraham who
[57:38] is the father of us all then he goes on
[57:42] to not only narrow down his definition
[57:43] but rather to finalize it for in
[57:45] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[57:48] singular with Jesus and counted the seed
[57:52] children as children of promise and
[57:55] promise as having to do with election or
[57:58] the choosing of
[58:00] God that's exactly what we have been
[58:03] saying these who are of the royal seed
[58:06] are the elect of God are the
[58:08] predestinated forn of God and were in
[58:11] the mind of God and in his thoughts in
[58:15] very plain language the true bride of
[58:17] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[58:20] though not expressed until each came
[58:22] forth in the designated decreed season
[58:26] as each member came forth it became
[58:29] expressed and took its place in the
[58:32] body thus this bride is the literal
[58:36] spoken word seed bride
[58:40] Hallelujah and though she is feminine in
[58:42] designation she is also called the body
[58:45] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[58:48] ought to be called that for she was
[58:50] predestinated in him came from the same
[58:53] Source was was eternal with him and is
[58:56] now manifesting God in a many membered
[59:00] body whereas once God was manifested in
[59:03] one member even our Lord Jesus
[59:08] Christ and so I just want to take from
[59:11] our scripture this morning we can see
[59:13] that the Lord God said it's not good
[59:15] that man should be
[59:16] alone and that was I would say uh uh
[59:21] maybe a shadow and a type of God wanting
[59:24] to manifest himself as well he didn't
[59:28] want to be alone either it wasn't good
[59:29] for God to be alone because we know in
[59:32] in John chapter 17 there was only one
[59:35] thing that we heard the prophet say that
[59:37] Jesus prayed for the one thing that he
[59:39] asked for the father all the rest of the
[59:41] prayer was a blessing on the on the
[59:43] Saints in the world but the one thing he
[59:45] asked for was Fellowship Jesus Christ
[59:48] asked for
[59:49] fellowship and God didn't want to be
[59:51] alone but here we have man now who is
[59:54] formed form Med Out of the Dust of the
[59:55] earth he still was masculine and
[59:58] feminine but where did the woman come
[1:00:00] from it came she came directly from the
[1:00:03] man she didn't come as a secondary
[1:00:06] product he didn't create her from the
[1:00:08] dust of the ground God took her directly
[1:00:12] from him and it's the same thing for the
[1:00:15] Bride of Jesus Christ today
[1:00:17] amen but looking at this this scripture
[1:00:21] here the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[1:00:24] fall upon Adam it's verse 21 of Genesis
[1:00:27] 2 and he slept and he took one of his
[1:00:31] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[1:00:33] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:00:36] had taken from man made he a woman and
[1:00:39] brought her unto the man he didn't just
[1:00:43] make her and then they just bumped into
[1:00:46] each other while they were doing their
[1:00:47] stuff in the garden they just fell in
[1:00:49] love one time God actually presented her
[1:00:53] to him amen
[1:00:55] and it just made me think brothers and
[1:00:56] sisters Paul said it but I believe it
[1:00:58] was God through Paul that said I am
[1:01:01] jealous over you with a Godly jealousy
[1:01:04] and I want to present you as a chaste
[1:01:08] virgin unto
[1:01:10] God isn't that exactly like the same
[1:01:13] scripture that we saw manifest in man
[1:01:15] but that's the ending of it it goes from
[1:01:17] the beginning of the Bible right to the
[1:01:19] very end in 2 Corinthians where he says
[1:01:21] that he wants to present Who as a Chase
[1:01:25] virgin he's jealous with a Godly
[1:01:27] jealousy it's beautiful to think about
[1:01:30] you know in the quote that we just read
[1:01:31] he spoke about Galatians 3 I think it's
[1:01:33] important maybe just to touch on this
[1:01:35] Galatians 3:16 Says now to Abraham and
[1:01:39] his seed were the promises made so he
[1:01:41] made the promises to Adam and to all of
[1:01:44] the seed that Adam Abraham had sorry he
[1:01:48] he said saith Not andto seeds as of many
[1:01:52] but as of one and to th th seed which is
[1:01:55] Christ I think it's just a beautiful
[1:01:58] statement when we can see this I kind of
[1:02:00] messed it up I'll read it again now to
[1:02:02] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[1:02:04] made and he saith Not andto seeds not
[1:02:08] plural just like the fruits of the
[1:02:11] spirit it's not plural it's fruit and
[1:02:14] Seed Not seeds as of many but as of one
[1:02:18] and to thy seed which is Christ but many
[1:02:21] would say well brother Barry you're
[1:02:22] talking about how that seed is Christ
[1:02:24] Christ and sure enough it is but don't
[1:02:26] forget every scripture has a compound
[1:02:28] meaning and
[1:02:29] Revelation that seed is one body one
[1:02:33] bride he's not looking for a many
[1:02:34] membered bride he's only looking for one
[1:02:37] bride amen amen one body one mind one
[1:02:41] Accord one spirit and that Spirit can't
[1:02:43] be hers it's got to be
[1:02:46] his God bless you brother Cherry Sister
[1:02:51] Mary you know we're talking about this
[1:02:53] bride of Jesus Christ and we hit it on
[1:02:56] on on Wednesday and I just want to get
[1:02:58] into it today I think it's real
[1:02:59] important for us to recognize
[1:03:02] um I know we do but maybe sometimes it
[1:03:06] can it can just go through the wash I
[1:03:09] don't know what we get and what we don't
[1:03:11] get so I just want to try I just felt
[1:03:13] led to go back this way is what I'm
[1:03:14] trying to say you know we talked about
[1:03:16] how the the word of God through the
[1:03:18] spirit brother bam talks about
[1:03:20] Revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:23] Revelation to the believer has to come
[1:03:26] by the Spirit by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:03:29] Revelation to the True Believer can
[1:03:31] never ever be overestimated
[1:03:34] overemphasized we can never ever talk
[1:03:36] about having too much Revelation
[1:03:38] according to the word through the spirit
[1:03:39] it can never happen and you know brother
[1:03:41] Bradon talks about how it will be a
[1:03:43] prophetic people someone with prophetic
[1:03:47] insight to be able to understand this
[1:03:49] word there's only one way we're going to
[1:03:51] have that prophetic insight and that is
[1:03:52] to have the Holy Ghost him himself it's
[1:03:55] not going to be being close to a prophet
[1:03:57] of our age it's not going to be being
[1:03:59] close to someone who claims to be
[1:04:00] prophetic and sometimes maybe they can
[1:04:02] hit it right and sometimes maybe they
[1:04:04] don't hit it right that's not going to
[1:04:06] be what does it for us it's got to be he
[1:04:08] the spirit of truth that comes to us and
[1:04:11] gives us this Revelation that gives us
[1:04:13] this insight into his Spirit but you
[1:04:16] know what happens is just before that
[1:04:18] like I said we can say the scripture we
[1:04:20] quote the scripture many times and the
[1:04:22] Lord God said it's not good that man
[1:04:23] should be alone and I will make for him
[1:04:25] an
[1:04:26] helpmate no it's a help meet someone who
[1:04:29] is able to meet the needs in that
[1:04:32] person's life not just a doormat not
[1:04:34] just a servant and here we have this
[1:04:37] talking about in the seven Church age
[1:04:39] book the exposition of the seven Church
[1:04:40] ages brother brandham says that this
[1:04:42] word will only be revealed to a special
[1:04:45] class of people and that's very true
[1:04:48] brothers and sisters I won't dispute
[1:04:49] that for a second but who is that
[1:04:51] special class of people many people
[1:04:53] would say it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:54] and you're 100% correct about that are
[1:04:56] you the Bride of Jesus Christ because if
[1:04:58] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ then
[1:04:59] you will have his spirit in you it won't
[1:05:02] be his Spirit Plus you that's right you
[1:05:04] will die out we will decrease so he can
[1:05:07] increase it's not going to be I'm
[1:05:09] retaining parts of me so that we can
[1:05:11] just go together he's he's he's he's
[1:05:14] jealous over us with a Godly jealousy
[1:05:16] and what is it it's it's Satan and God
[1:05:18] Waring for our soul that's right and
[1:05:21] whoever we're willing to surrender to
[1:05:23] whoever we're willing to submit Our
[1:05:25] Lives to that's the one that's going to
[1:05:26] win he's a gentleman he's not going to
[1:05:28] come and break down our door and say I'm
[1:05:29] just going to storm the castle and I'm
[1:05:31] going to take you and put you over my
[1:05:32] shoulder and take you back to my castle
[1:05:34] because you're now my wife I've
[1:05:36] conquered you no he sends an invitation
[1:05:39] like a
[1:05:40] gentleman and we have the opportunity to
[1:05:42] come to that invitation yes or say no
[1:05:45] I'm you know I've got this I've got that
[1:05:47] you know maybe one day when I see uh the
[1:05:50] two prophets happen in Israel or I see
[1:05:53] uh a female president or maybe there's
[1:05:56] an American Pope I start to see all
[1:05:59] these different things happen then maybe
[1:06:00] I'll get right and do no it's all going
[1:06:03] to be happening and we're going to be
[1:06:04] missing it because we're trying to put
[1:06:07] something before the word of God that
[1:06:10] special class of people will be only
[1:06:13] amen for him amen they will only be
[1:06:16] interested in him and I know maybe some
[1:06:18] people might say brother Barry you're
[1:06:19] preaching to the choir what I want to do
[1:06:21] is encourage us brothers and sisters
[1:06:22] we're at the very edge the very ending
[1:06:25] of all time this is the culmination of
[1:06:27] all the ages this is what the prophet
[1:06:29] looked for we know that in Daniel the
[1:06:32] the the the the the word of God says
[1:06:35] that you know Daniel you got to shut it
[1:06:36] up you you got to seal it up it's not
[1:06:38] for you to know it's for a different
[1:06:41] people a certain class of people not
[1:06:45] someone that actually Puffs themselves
[1:06:47] up and says I I'm so glad I can say I'm
[1:06:50] a a message believer I've been in the
[1:06:52] message all my life everything good in
[1:06:54] my life I've never
[1:06:57] sinned maybe but do you have the Holy
[1:07:01] Ghost since you
[1:07:03] believe that's the critical Factor
[1:07:05] brothers and sisters if we're a special
[1:07:07] class of people then we're going to have
[1:07:08] the Holy Ghost that's it that's the
[1:07:11] differentiating factor doesn't matter
[1:07:12] where we come from doesn't matter who
[1:07:14] our parents are doesn't matter who our
[1:07:15] pastor was doesn't matter who our pastor
[1:07:18] is have you got the Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost what makes this people special
[1:07:23] it's got to be this Spirit of Christ
[1:07:24] Living in them amen it's got to be
[1:07:29] Christ in us our hope of glory
[1:07:33] amen we know that Christ the bride's
[1:07:36] husband he was willing to lay aside all
[1:07:39] of his glory all of his pride all of his
[1:07:44] rights and come down and just submit
[1:07:47] himself completely amen as a husband not
[1:07:51] as the Bride As the husband now I want
[1:07:54] to say this morning how many of us
[1:07:55] husbands are willing to set aside all of
[1:07:57] our pride all of our
[1:07:59] Glory all of our rights for our families
[1:08:03] and for our bride how many of us are
[1:08:06] willing to do that or or is our wife a
[1:08:09] help meet for
[1:08:11] us what makes this people a special
[1:08:14] class of people is is having humility in
[1:08:17] their lives truly having the spirit of
[1:08:19] Christ in their lives he's not going to
[1:08:22] share his glory with nobody
[1:08:24] Christ the husband is willing to lay
[1:08:26] aside all of his first estate to be
[1:08:28] mistreated and killed for who for his
[1:08:31] creation for
[1:08:33] everyone for all of the people in the
[1:08:36] Earth but only a special class of people
[1:08:38] is able to say wow I get that and even a
[1:08:41] more special class of people is able to
[1:08:43] say
[1:08:44] my he did that for me I'm willing to
[1:08:48] accept him at his word whatever that
[1:08:51] means if he says lay down your life that
[1:08:53] I'll lay down my life if he says quit
[1:08:55] your job and sell everything you've got
[1:08:57] in this country and move to another
[1:08:58] country because I'm leading you then
[1:09:00] I'll do that if he says do whatever I
[1:09:02] I'll do it I'm willing to do what he
[1:09:04] wants because that's what he did he
[1:09:07] followed his leadership the leadership
[1:09:09] that he was given but to be this special
[1:09:11] class of people I think it's beautiful
[1:09:13] do our lives show show to the world
[1:09:16] around us that that we are the special
[1:09:18] class of people I think that song is
[1:09:20] Beautiful once again I just love how the
[1:09:22] music happens I got tied up in the back
[1:09:24] there just a little distracted and I
[1:09:26] wound up not coming out when the song
[1:09:28] leader said and the last song that he
[1:09:30] sang he's changing me is he changing us
[1:09:32] today brothers and
[1:09:33] sisters the love of God shown to the
[1:09:36] world what is that song saying the love
[1:09:38] of God shown to the world is that Jesus
[1:09:40] came and died at Calvary no I want to
[1:09:43] say that that song is saying the love of
[1:09:45] God shown to the world is Christ in you
[1:09:47] the hope of
[1:09:48] glory amen as we live our lives we're
[1:09:51] showing Christ the hope of of Glory to
[1:09:54] this world around us but he's got to be
[1:09:56] changing us we cannot be who we were
[1:10:00] yesterday we might not be who we going
[1:10:02] to be tomorrow but who are we right now
[1:10:04] is he doing something for us
[1:10:08] now our lives have got to show that he's
[1:10:12] changing us and I say this brothers and
[1:10:15] sisters it's pretty easy to put on the
[1:10:17] Polish and go to church and show our
[1:10:18] brothers and sisters and say yeah man
[1:10:20] he's changing me I've got this and I've
[1:10:22] got that I got the other revelation but
[1:10:24] what's happening at home what's our home
[1:10:26] life like is is our spouses saying that
[1:10:29] we are changing that God is changing us
[1:10:32] or or are we saying wow man I just can't
[1:10:35] believe it we we still aren't having a
[1:10:37] congruent message there's still
[1:10:38] something just a little bit funny it's
[1:10:40] just not lining up you know I would say
[1:10:44] if that's what we're seeing don't give
[1:10:45] up take courage because the devil's
[1:10:49] fighting you know we heard from the
[1:10:51] prophet we're going to have to fight for
[1:10:53] every single inch of ground that we get
[1:10:54] we're not going to get it
[1:10:55] freely character that we're going to
[1:10:57] have to cross over into Glory with to
[1:10:59] have these bodies changed here it's a
[1:11:01] victory it's not a gift we have to
[1:11:03] overcome all of this life to be able to
[1:11:06] get there but what do we do brothers and
[1:11:08] sisters I want to give us a key a secret
[1:11:09] brother bradam calls it and that secret
[1:11:11] is simple alls we've got to do is dial
[1:11:13] to ourselves and let him live in us and
[1:11:16] when he lives in us there's identifiable
[1:11:19] markers amen and until we see those
[1:11:22] living out through us just keep pressing
[1:11:24] on and I think once we get to the place
[1:11:26] where we can see them it's going to just
[1:11:28] be easy for us to actually live them but
[1:11:31] you know we all struggle we all struggle
[1:11:34] yes I'm not saying we don't it's a
[1:11:36] battle and God allowed it to happen this
[1:11:39] way so that he could manifest his power
[1:11:42] through a certain class of people
[1:11:43] through a special class of people that
[1:11:45] would be able to say I believe that word
[1:11:47] and I'm willing to allow him to live it
[1:11:49] out through me amen you know the
[1:11:51] troubling part is and this really is is
[1:11:55] when people try to live it out
[1:11:56] themselves yes cuz you can live it out
[1:11:59] for days and weeks and months and years
[1:12:01] maybe even
[1:12:04] decades but eventually if you're doing
[1:12:06] it God will allow it to come to the
[1:12:08] surface to show that it's just
[1:12:11] you and that's the way it is but when
[1:12:13] it's him he will do it in such a way
[1:12:16] that nobody will ever be able to say
[1:12:18] anything about it because the word of
[1:12:21] God says take no thought for what you
[1:12:22] should say in that hour
[1:12:24] when they will revile you when they will
[1:12:25] come and persecute you for my name's
[1:12:27] sake the devil will do it through people
[1:12:30] like we've said over and over again you
[1:12:32] know when we get into The Squeeze In Our
[1:12:34] Lives it's just going to show who's on
[1:12:35] the inside that's what's going to
[1:12:36] squeeze out what's going on in our lives
[1:12:39] we're going to show it we can't hide it
[1:12:42] but you know if if we're not seeing the
[1:12:44] right person come out when the squeeze
[1:12:45] happens just take courage I want to
[1:12:47] encourage us this morning I don't want
[1:12:48] to beat us up and make us feel bad I'm
[1:12:50] saying all of this to say brothers and
[1:12:52] sisters keep pressing on
[1:12:54] because there is a delivering power for
[1:12:56] every single disease that we have in our
[1:12:58] lives he took 39 stripes for all of our
[1:13:05] diseases God formed the man out of the
[1:13:08] ground and caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:13:10] upon
[1:13:11] Him upon man so that he could take a
[1:13:14] bride out of his side right out of him a
[1:13:18] part of
[1:13:19] him you know one of the things that uh I
[1:13:22] just think is amazing when we look at
[1:13:23] this this whole entire
[1:13:27] discussion is to recognize that the only
[1:13:30] reason we we would be ever classified as
[1:13:34] a special class of people is because he
[1:13:36] did it all
[1:13:38] Hallelujah yes sir and when we recognize
[1:13:40] that brothers and sisters there's no way
[1:13:43] there's no way if we truly recognize it
[1:13:46] that we could ever be puffed up ever
[1:13:49] because we recognize what he's done for
[1:13:51] us right some people have to go and seek
[1:13:55] it some people seek out the the life
[1:13:58] they seek out a better life and they go
[1:14:00] to church and they have good works and
[1:14:02] they do all the things but they'll never
[1:14:04] be able to just be freely given the
[1:14:06] invitation that you've been given that
[1:14:09] we've been given to call be called unto
[1:14:11] the marriage supper of the
[1:14:14] Lamb that's why when we read that
[1:14:16] scripture in Revelations let us rejoice
[1:14:18] and be very glad for the marriage of the
[1:14:22] Lamb has come and his
[1:14:24] wife not bride anymore his wife that
[1:14:27] means there's already been a
[1:14:29] consummation there's already been a
[1:14:31] relationship there's already been an
[1:14:33] intimate relationship that's happened
[1:14:35] his wife hath made herself ready we've
[1:14:37] got every single reason to Rejoice
[1:14:39] brothers and
[1:14:41] sisters you know we've been talking
[1:14:43] about possessing our enemies Gates and
[1:14:46] and we know that it only comes to
[1:14:48] Revelation that's we've gone on and on
[1:14:50] about it and and I think that we could
[1:14:51] just continue to do so but I don't
[1:14:53] really want to so far this morning I
[1:14:55] just want to touch on it for a second
[1:14:57] because I think it's so important to
[1:14:58] just remember how this can all sort of
[1:15:00] maybe stitch together we we know that it
[1:15:03] only comes through Revelation and the
[1:15:04] revelation of God's word and that
[1:15:07] revelation we talked about earlier it
[1:15:09] only comes by the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:15:11] Lives there's no way that we're ever
[1:15:13] going to study our way into it there's
[1:15:14] no way that we're going to ever tenure
[1:15:16] our way into it I was born in the
[1:15:18] message I had a tremendous message
[1:15:20] Pastor you know what happens when that
[1:15:22] happens is Ty Al we can wind up seeing
[1:15:24] that Pastor have uh human parts they
[1:15:27] have human fail abilities God will allow
[1:15:30] that to happen to cause us to stop
[1:15:32] looking at a man and to start looking at
[1:15:36] him but you know I heard it said the
[1:15:39] other day I was shocked I'd never really
[1:15:40] thought of it this way and I say Lord
[1:15:42] help me I mean I know where I stand in
[1:15:44] my heart don't get me wrong but just for
[1:15:45] the record I want it to be said you know
[1:15:48] how we hear it said there's three kinds
[1:15:49] of Believers in every church and I'm
[1:15:51] sure that we could all say Amen to that
[1:15:53] I don't want everyone to start looking
[1:15:54] at everyone and saying who's who in the
[1:15:56] zoo don't do that just say everyone's a
[1:15:58] Believer that's all because that's
[1:16:00] really the way it is but I heard a
[1:16:02] brother say it that you know that
[1:16:03] doesn't just apply to the congregation
[1:16:05] to the Ley that applies to the
[1:16:09] preachers I thought my
[1:16:12] goodness shocked me I know where I stand
[1:16:16] I'm not afraid because I know God called
[1:16:18] me and I trust nobody here is afraid but
[1:16:21] you know that's what happens sometimes
[1:16:23] people find themselves in a position
[1:16:25] that they shouldn't really be in and
[1:16:27] when they're in a position that they
[1:16:28] shouldn't be in they can cause a lot of
[1:16:30] hurt they can cause a lot of Shame they
[1:16:32] can cause a lot of tragedy that doesn't
[1:16:34] need to
[1:16:36] happen I thought my goodness the pastors
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:41] preachers i' never thought of that
[1:16:43] before even right but I can I can see
[1:16:46] where it would be true right but what
[1:16:49] happens when that happens sometimes we
[1:16:51] can get something in our life that will
[1:16:53] cause us to stop growing to stop
[1:16:56] changing because what happened was a
[1:16:58] minister hurt us a minister hurt my
[1:17:02] family a Ministry caused this or didn't
[1:17:06] do that stop looking at Ministries
[1:17:08] brothers and sisters don't look at
[1:17:09] Ministries they won't save
[1:17:11] you that's right they'll take you down
[1:17:14] right look to
[1:17:18] christu look away to Jesus right amen
[1:17:21] yes you know brothers and sisters I said
[1:17:23] it earlier I always do it but you know
[1:17:25] when we get a revelation about the word
[1:17:27] when God speaks to us I trust that
[1:17:29] everyone here has had a revelation about
[1:17:31] the word where you can sit down and read
[1:17:32] the word and and something just doesn't
[1:17:34] make sense to you and you just ask the
[1:17:37] Lord what does that mean and he reveals
[1:17:40] it to you personally I trust that's
[1:17:43] happened if it has never happened just
[1:17:45] ask him and and it will happen but you
[1:17:47] know when we get Revelation like that
[1:17:49] brothers and sisters there there's
[1:17:51] there's a reason for it it's not just a
[1:17:53] personal idea that we get it's not
[1:17:55] something that we just learn or or study
[1:17:59] and and someone speaks to us sometimes
[1:18:01] God will use that but more times than
[1:18:04] not it's going to be in the heart he's
[1:18:06] going to talk directly to the heart and
[1:18:08] we're going to be able to catch a
[1:18:09] revelation about it it's not just a
[1:18:12] personal idea yet it's it's not just a
[1:18:14] thought that's expressed by a word right
[1:18:18] where somebody preaches and then
[1:18:19] suddenly we get this Revelation this
[1:18:21] Mighty Revelation you know was a prophet
[1:18:23] that used a bunch of words which were
[1:18:25] thoughts expressed he said it that that
[1:18:27] a word is a thought expressed and works
[1:18:30] are Faith expressed and and you know we
[1:18:32] can take and go a long ways with that
[1:18:34] but I just want to say it this way a a
[1:18:36] word is a thought expressed and that is
[1:18:38] not a revelation and and having a word
[1:18:41] expressed because we've had the thought
[1:18:43] doesn't mean that we've truly got a
[1:18:44] revelation because a lot of people can
[1:18:46] quote quotes a lot of people can say
[1:18:48] jesus' name a lot of people can claim
[1:18:50] the word of God and the blood of Jesus
[1:18:53] but how many people live the word of God
[1:18:55] and live the life of Jesus Christ that
[1:18:58] is the identifiable marker it's the
[1:19:00] lital life of Jesus Christ brothers and
[1:19:03] sisters it's not some some polyana
[1:19:06] doctrinal thing that we're talking about
[1:19:08] here we're talking about Jesus Christ
[1:19:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:19:12] where they'll write a book of Acts
[1:19:13] behind
[1:19:14] you not just some Minister not just
[1:19:18] behind brother Andrew Glover or Wayne
[1:19:20] Lawson behind you behind your children
[1:19:23] because they saw you lay down a Godly
[1:19:26] example the life that you live in church
[1:19:28] is the life you live at home and the
[1:19:30] life you live at home as a life you live
[1:19:32] at work as parents children are watching
[1:19:34] you you can say all you want but what do
[1:19:37] you say around the dinner table what
[1:19:39] life example do you give them do you
[1:19:42] come to a communion do you take them to
[1:19:43] communion do you go to church on
[1:19:45] Wednesday nights are they seeing the
[1:19:47] Gospel of Jesus Christ according to our
[1:19:49] day live before their very eyes because
[1:19:53] if they are they're going to say my
[1:19:55] goodness there's Believers and when they
[1:19:58] hear their friends say there's no such
[1:20:00] thing as God Jesus is just like bunny
[1:20:03] rabbits Jesus is just like Santa Claus
[1:20:06] the children will say no he's not how do
[1:20:09] you know cuz he's alive and he's alive
[1:20:11] right here in my heart I know him
[1:20:14] personally I've repented I've been
[1:20:16] baptized in jesus' name and I know I
[1:20:18] don't have sin I know I fall all the
[1:20:21] time I fail all the time but that
[1:20:23] doesn't matter because he's jealous over
[1:20:25] me with a Godly jealousy and he's gonna
[1:20:27] present me one day as a chased virgin to
[1:20:30] his father it's not just about
[1:20:33] expressing words it's about living
[1:20:37] life the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] yes out of 1961
[1:20:44] 0416 Abraham and his seed after
[1:20:51] him
[1:20:54] Amen brother brandom says justification
[1:20:56] is what you
[1:20:58] believe sanctification is what the blood
[1:21:01] did for you you're Sanctified by
[1:21:04] believing but when you're filled with
[1:21:06] the Holy Ghost it's the person of the
[1:21:09] Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] himself oh the
[1:21:13] person not
[1:21:15] imagination not some kind of
[1:21:18] psychology but the person of the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost amen and to you my Christian
[1:21:25] Science brother and you that don't
[1:21:28] believe that the Holy Ghost is a person
[1:21:31] he is a personal
[1:21:34] pronoun in a day and age where we need
[1:21:38] to make sure that we are clarifying
[1:21:40] we're bringing into Focus we're
[1:21:41] sharpening the lines and making sure
[1:21:44] that we're crossing the te's and dotting
[1:21:46] the eyes we want to make sure this is
[1:21:48] very clearly documented here he is a
[1:21:52] personal pronoun Hallelujah a person the
[1:21:55] man Jesus Christ and it's important for
[1:21:58] us to recognize brothers and sisters
[1:22:00] we're not talking about the
[1:22:01] Nazarene the Nazarene was a part of the
[1:22:04] godhead who is seated at the right hand
[1:22:07] of the father right
[1:22:08] now but his Spirit when he died and went
[1:22:12] up to sit down he set back upon men and
[1:22:15] and manifested in in the upper room
[1:22:18] where the 120 were gathered together
[1:22:20] following his instruction wait in jerus
[1:22:22] Jerusalem T ye there until you are
[1:22:25] endued with power from where from on
[1:22:28] high from that seat right beside the
[1:22:31] father Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is a
[1:22:35] person he's a personal pronoun the Bible
[1:22:38] said when he the Holy Ghost has come he
[1:22:40] will testify of me he is a person not a
[1:22:45] thought so we're not going to actually
[1:22:47] say I believe Jesus I believe the
[1:22:49] message of the hour and then run home
[1:22:51] and live a certainly different life life
[1:22:52] than what we live in the church that's
[1:22:54] not going to work because that's not
[1:22:56] Jesus but you know brothers and sisters
[1:22:58] I'm here this morning to try and
[1:22:59] encourage us find that life if you
[1:23:02] haven't found that life find that life
[1:23:04] and you know the way you find it is Just
[1:23:06] Surrender yourself to him maybe for many
[1:23:08] years we've had an intellectual
[1:23:10] understanding of this message of the
[1:23:12] hour and we know the quotes and we know
[1:23:14] the message but maybe just not an actual
[1:23:17] living person breathing in our lives
[1:23:19] where we can say I am so glad I can say
[1:23:22] I'm one of
[1:23:25] them when we are it changes us when we
[1:23:29] are this book becomes a new book I'm so
[1:23:32] thankful for this book you know I I I
[1:23:35] have this book here I just thought I
[1:23:38] would take a moment to to mention it's
[1:23:41] pretty
[1:23:42] neat uh I saw a brother who had a Bible
[1:23:45] a family bible one time and uh I thought
[1:23:47] my goodness that's pretty cool I'd love
[1:23:50] to get one of those one day and you know
[1:23:53] I just uh I find myself in this position
[1:23:56] here as pastor and my family finds
[1:24:00] myself here in this position as pastor
[1:24:03] and my family is watching and and and
[1:24:06] and wondering you know scratching their
[1:24:08] heads thinking what happened to him like
[1:24:09] how did that ever happen and and some of
[1:24:11] my family might think well a girl came
[1:24:13] along and Drug him to church and you
[1:24:16] know he just is after the girl but I
[1:24:18] think if anyone has ever in my family
[1:24:20] listened to me long enough via YouTube
[1:24:22] they would understand that it's it's
[1:24:23] probably a little bit more than just a
[1:24:25] girl but anyways in my heart I wished
[1:24:28] you know I thought Lord I think that' be
[1:24:30] so neat to have a family bible my aunts
[1:24:34] they live in the the Lower
[1:24:36] Mainland um of course through my mom
[1:24:39] who's streaming probably right now uh
[1:24:42] she told them my family knows that I'm a
[1:24:44] pastor and uh one of the ants said you
[1:24:48] know what I've got a Bible that he might
[1:24:50] want maybe I should give it to him my
[1:24:53] mom said well I don't know why don't you
[1:24:55] ask him so we're at my mom's 80th
[1:24:57] birthday party recently and I got to see
[1:24:59] both of my aunts which I don't see very
[1:25:00] often and both of them said we each have
[1:25:03] a Bible we'd like to give you if you'd
[1:25:05] want them one of them is from
[1:25:07] 1891 from from my mom's mom's side of
[1:25:12] the family and this Bible here is from
[1:25:14] my mom's dad's side of the family and
[1:25:17] this Bible was actually presented to the
[1:25:19] the I think it's the United Church in
[1:25:21] Scandia Alberta because he moved a
[1:25:24] church from Saskatchewan this is my
[1:25:27] mom's grandfather by the way he moved a
[1:25:29] church from Saskatchewan to Scandia
[1:25:32] Alberta and the church presented this
[1:25:34] Bible to him as a as a token of
[1:25:38] appreciation and I thought that was
[1:25:40] pretty amazing so anyways I I just I'm
[1:25:44] so thankful for the word of God and
[1:25:46] sometimes to look back at our heritage
[1:25:47] it's it's a wonderful thing you know and
[1:25:49] and to be able to look at it and see
[1:25:51] that you know you know he he will always
[1:25:54] have a representation in in his season
[1:25:57] in his time and and to just take the
[1:25:59] word of God you know many people I'm
[1:26:01] sure have looked at this word of God and
[1:26:03] and said you know yeah it's the word of
[1:26:05] God but some people look at it and say
[1:26:07] it's it's it's more than life to me it's
[1:26:10] not just a book it's not just something
[1:26:11] we put on the shelf and I'm not going to
[1:26:14] belittle the fact that maybe other
[1:26:15] people didn't see the significance of it
[1:26:17] what I want to say is thank you to the
[1:26:19] people that were willing to actually
[1:26:21] give it to me because I truly value this
[1:26:23] and really appreciate it I love to look
[1:26:26] at the other Bible which is just about
[1:26:27] worn out it's it's a smaller one and
[1:26:30] it's just about worn out to look at it
[1:26:32] and think about how many nights of of
[1:26:34] pleading prayer for needs that were in
[1:26:36] their lives some of the the there's
[1:26:38] notes inside of it that are folded up
[1:26:40] they're handwritten in cursive talking
[1:26:42] about end during the hard Winters and
[1:26:44] some of the things that they had to go
[1:26:45] through because they are all in the same
[1:26:47] area in that town Scandia you know as
[1:26:50] Pioneers in in this country in like the
[1:26:52] early 1900s to hear about that and and
[1:26:55] to have that same Bible that they packed
[1:26:58] back in that day that's where women
[1:27:00] dress like women and and men dress like
[1:27:02] men and and they behave just a little
[1:27:04] bit differently and to still have that
[1:27:07] Bible and think my goodness it's the
[1:27:08] same word of God it's the King James
[1:27:11] version and that's what they studied
[1:27:12] even in the United Church my goodness
[1:27:16] amen I thought it was wonderful so now
[1:27:19] I'm going to get into something that I
[1:27:20] want to be clear I'm not trying to make
[1:27:22] anything an an idol so don't get me
[1:27:24] wrong I just think it's wonderful to see
[1:27:26] the the book and it's just got a real
[1:27:28] significant value to me and you know
[1:27:31] what the end of the day if something
[1:27:32] happened if we had a fire at our house
[1:27:34] and this Bible was lost it wouldn't turn
[1:27:37] me away from the word of God one bit
[1:27:39] because I've already eaten the book I've
[1:27:41] already eaten this entire book I got
[1:27:43] every word squished down in there and
[1:27:45] you know it was bitter sometimes in my
[1:27:47] belly but but it it was sure sweet in my
[1:27:50] mouth and and I just love it so thank
[1:27:53] you to anyone who had parted given me
[1:27:56] this Bible I really appreciate it it's a
[1:27:59] wonderful
[1:28:00] thing you know I want to talk this
[1:28:02] morning a little bit about uh family
[1:28:05] Idols as well I want to talk about Idols
[1:28:08] that we can raise up in our lives and uh
[1:28:10] you know something even like this Bible
[1:28:12] could become like a family Idol to say
[1:28:15] that I worship it and you know we want
[1:28:17] to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ but we
[1:28:18] want to worship the life that's inside
[1:28:20] this Bible we don't want to worship ship
[1:28:22] the Bible and say I have to cherish it
[1:28:24] and set up a shrine for it because
[1:28:26] that's actually going to be idolatry
[1:28:28] we're looking to a book instead of
[1:28:30] looking to the author and that's what we
[1:28:32] want to do brothers and sisters is look
[1:28:34] to the author and I just want to say
[1:28:36] this morning that that it's possible for
[1:28:38] us to actually create an image in our
[1:28:42] lives we can erect an image in our lives
[1:28:44] that will get in the way from us being
[1:28:47] able to see the truth in our
[1:28:49] day and you know many different ways of
[1:28:52] doing this we can we can idolize our
[1:28:55] parents we can idolize our grandparents
[1:28:57] parents can idolize their children you
[1:29:00] know what Satan doesn't care what we
[1:29:03] idolize so long as it's actually being
[1:29:06] just put before God because we know
[1:29:07] that's what the word of God says in the
[1:29:09] book of of Leviticus I think it is maybe
[1:29:11] it's Deuteronomy uh you know what Thou
[1:29:13] shalt have no other gods no graven image
[1:29:16] before me you one of the Ten
[1:29:18] Commandments we're very familiar with it
[1:29:20] we we should put nothing before the word
[1:29:22] of God if we do ever put anything before
[1:29:24] God in our lives it's
[1:29:26] idolatry it's actually making it
[1:29:29] idolatry brothers and sisters we could
[1:29:30] take the message of the hour and make it
[1:29:33] idolatry because we're not here to study
[1:29:35] and learn about a messenger we're here
[1:29:37] to study and learn about the one who
[1:29:39] sent that messenger the god of William
[1:29:43] Maryam brandham that's the one who died
[1:29:45] on Calvary for us we've got to be very
[1:29:48] careful the devil doesn't care what
[1:29:49] ditch we go into one way or the other so
[1:29:51] long as we're not right down in the
[1:29:52] middle we know that we talked about it
[1:29:54] there is a way there's a highway and
[1:29:56] there is a way brothers and sisters if
[1:29:57] we miss that way we're going to miss
[1:30:00] where we want to get off of this highway
[1:30:02] that way is a way of Holiness that's
[1:30:04] what the word of God says we preached
[1:30:06] about that a while ago but we can
[1:30:07] idolize things in our lives that will
[1:30:09] actually get us away from being able to
[1:30:12] see the true life the person that we
[1:30:15] just talked about in that quote of Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ Living out through US amen you
[1:30:20] know many times as a parent we can say I
[1:30:24] I'll say this by experience you know
[1:30:25] that's the way I was raised and I turned
[1:30:28] out fine so it must be just fine for my
[1:30:30] children I I must be able to do that
[1:30:32] it'll work and I turned out fine didn't
[1:30:35] I and we can do that right we can do it
[1:30:38] to our spouse we can do it to our
[1:30:40] children we can do it to ourselves in
[1:30:42] the mirror don't I look great oh yeah I
[1:30:44] turned out
[1:30:45] perfect knowing full well that we
[1:30:47] haven't that we're actually quite messed
[1:30:50] up but we're just afraid to look at that
[1:30:52] in the mirror and really admit that not
[1:30:54] that our parents mess us up I'm not
[1:30:56] saying that but what I'm saying is just
[1:30:58] because our parents did something a
[1:31:00] certain way it doesn't mean that we
[1:31:03] should and if we're willing to say that
[1:31:05] I'm going to do what my parents did
[1:31:08] before I'll do what the word of God says
[1:31:11] that becomes idolatry in our lives and
[1:31:13] if we do that brothers and sisters if we
[1:31:16] have idolatry in our lives that's where
[1:31:18] we stop the power of God from coming
[1:31:20] through and living out through us right
[1:31:22] and and our children will see it our
[1:31:23] spouses will see it as long as that
[1:31:25] image is
[1:31:28] there it'll get in the way I got into
[1:31:31] this this thinking
[1:31:34] about idolatry and I thought maybe I was
[1:31:36] going on a tangent on a crazy tangent
[1:31:38] here and I never want to do that but I
[1:31:41] just got thinking about it you know it's
[1:31:43] okay to have a an image it's okay to
[1:31:45] have an idea it's okay to have something
[1:31:48] in our lives I'm not saying that we
[1:31:50] shouldn't have family tradition that we
[1:31:52] shouldn't have things in our lives but
[1:31:54] sometimes like I said it can get in the
[1:31:56] way of the word of God as long as
[1:31:57] whatever that image is or that idea is
[1:32:00] that we have in our lives maybe it's a
[1:32:01] tradition as long as it doesn't
[1:32:03] supersede the word of God it's all right
[1:32:07] amen but like I said many times we can
[1:32:09] say it's worked all good for my parents
[1:32:11] it's worked all good for their parents
[1:32:12] it's worked all good for the brothers
[1:32:13] and sisters everybody's doing it it's
[1:32:15] just fine is it does it match up with
[1:32:17] the word of God I remember brother Ken
[1:32:20] teaching it many times take whatever is
[1:32:21] we think we know or that we believe
[1:32:23] according to the message of the hour and
[1:32:24] run it back to the word of God if it
[1:32:26] doesn't line up with the word of God
[1:32:27] brothers and sisters put it on the Shelf
[1:32:30] leave it alone because it's not right
[1:32:33] it's got to be according to the word of
[1:32:34] God just as we said this morning
[1:32:36] sometimes we can say helpmate right we
[1:32:39] can begin to say I've got a helpmate
[1:32:42] that's what my wife is she's my
[1:32:44] helpmate and maybe she is but is that
[1:32:46] what the word of God says I help meet
[1:32:50] someone able to help you specifically
[1:32:54] and I would go so far as to say she
[1:32:55] should come directly from your side she
[1:32:57] should literally be a part of you and
[1:32:59] I'll say it this way also brothers and
[1:33:01] sisters if you do consummate the
[1:33:02] marriage then she has then she is the
[1:33:05] Two Become One amen and how does that
[1:33:08] manifest it's simple born in sin shaped
[1:33:11] in iniquity comes into the world
[1:33:13] speaking
[1:33:14] lies if you and your wife your your wife
[1:33:18] and your husband you come together to
[1:33:20] become one flesh how does that happen
[1:33:21] you have a baby now the Two Become One
[1:33:25] You're
[1:33:27] creators power of creation is in your
[1:33:31] hands you're not just a normal being on
[1:33:35] this Earth you're the highest level of
[1:33:37] Life the highest form of life in the
[1:33:40] universe a human being the only thing is
[1:33:43] you've been given the ability to create
[1:33:45] the wrong way that's why a baby is born
[1:33:48] in sin shaped in iniquity comes into the
[1:33:50] world speaking Lies We we were we were
[1:33:52] created to have the spoken word
[1:33:55] birth but I think it's beautiful because
[1:33:58] we can say there's some people in this
[1:34:00] world today that are having that spoken
[1:34:03] word birth they hear the Vindicated
[1:34:06] prophets speak they hear the voice of a
[1:34:08] Vindicated prophet and they recognize
[1:34:10] that's a man's voice but there's
[1:34:12] something about that voice there's
[1:34:13] something behind that voice there's
[1:34:15] something different about what this man
[1:34:16] is saying brothers and sisters that's a
[1:34:18] spoken word birth when you can say a
[1:34:21] Amen to that word and take it into your
[1:34:24] womb you become a spoken word seed Bride
[1:34:29] As we talked about earlier in the
[1:34:30] message this
[1:34:32] morning you know sometimes we can we can
[1:34:34] take these ideas and and these these
[1:34:36] Idols that can pop up in our lives and
[1:34:38] and and sometimes it's hurts we can make
[1:34:42] an image out of a hurt we can say that
[1:34:45] I've been hurt so bad that I could never
[1:34:47] go back to that thing or that way or
[1:34:49] that place or that person or whatever it
[1:34:50] is we can have those hurts and they go
[1:34:53] very very deep and they become an image
[1:34:56] in our lives if we're not careful can we
[1:34:59] go and see that brother or that sister
[1:35:01] ever again can we go and fellowship with
[1:35:03] them and just have lunch or supper or
[1:35:05] whatever and everything will be fine can
[1:35:06] we go and fellowship with them because
[1:35:08] we're going to do that in
[1:35:10] eternity we're not going to be in
[1:35:12] separate places with a big wall fixed
[1:35:14] between us there's nothing in the word
[1:35:15] of God that talks about that the word of
[1:35:18] God talks about how there's going to be
[1:35:19] no need of light in the city because the
[1:35:21] light of the Lamb will light the entire
[1:35:23] city there's going to be streets of
[1:35:25] transparent gold the prophet talks about
[1:35:27] it in future home that the houses are
[1:35:28] going to be made out of transparent gold
[1:35:30] we're not going to have fences and walls
[1:35:32] and camps and and
[1:35:34] groups we're going to fellowship with
[1:35:36] one another because why because we're
[1:35:38] going to be of one body of one mind of
[1:35:40] one Accord one Spirit one bride it's not
[1:35:44] going to be multi- multi Brides but
[1:35:47] sometimes we can take these hurts that
[1:35:48] happen in our lives and make images out
[1:35:50] of them and you know one of the biggest
[1:35:52] ones is to see our parents hurt as
[1:35:55] children and to let that hurt take over
[1:35:58] and we create an image in our lives of
[1:36:00] this hurt and we'll say we'll never let
[1:36:02] that happen in our lives and we'll lead
[1:36:03] a guarded life and everything that we do
[1:36:05] will always be according to that image
[1:36:08] that we have set up in our lives you
[1:36:10] know sometimes it's just an individual
[1:36:11] thing someone hurts me and I'll never
[1:36:14] you can put in whatever it is that goes
[1:36:16] with that because that person hurt me
[1:36:18] I'll never whatever that is that's not
[1:36:21] the spirit of Christ that's an idol that
[1:36:23] pops up in our lives and we know it's
[1:36:26] fear because we don't want to get hurt
[1:36:29] nobody wants to get
[1:36:31] hurt but you know the spirit of Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ that person that we were talking
[1:36:35] about not the Nazarene the Holy Ghost
[1:36:37] himself when he comes to town he changes
[1:36:40] everything in our lives and you know if
[1:36:42] you look back in in the Old Testament
[1:36:44] there was times where kings were raised
[1:36:45] up and they raised up Groves and they
[1:36:48] created high places if you think about
[1:36:50] those Brothers and sisters nowadays
[1:36:52] shadows and types of the Old Testament
[1:36:54] towards the New Testament shadows and
[1:36:56] types of of Our Lives we can set up
[1:36:59] Groves and and Groves what's a Grove a
[1:37:01] Grove is an area with trees to protect
[1:37:04] where they're going to be doing
[1:37:05] something inside a nice Grove of trees
[1:37:08] so that you can set up a high place and
[1:37:10] that high place can have that image or
[1:37:13] that hurt or that thing that will keep
[1:37:14] you and every single time something
[1:37:16] comes up in your life you'll say you
[1:37:18] know maybe we should do this or an
[1:37:20] invitation to do that but you'll say but
[1:37:22] what about that
[1:37:23] thing and you'll always run everything
[1:37:26] through that thing because that thing is
[1:37:28] there but you know God allowed for Kings
[1:37:31] to be raised up in the Old Testament
[1:37:33] also when those Groves were created and
[1:37:36] those high places to be there where they
[1:37:38] would come in and tear down the Groves
[1:37:40] and they would knock down the high
[1:37:42] places and they would say there's one
[1:37:44] king of kings and Lord of lords and
[1:37:46] that's the mighty Jehovah that's the God
[1:37:48] I serve I'm not willing to tolerate
[1:37:50] these Idol even though they're my
[1:37:53] fathers I we know there's testimony in
[1:37:57] the Bible of Kings doing that taking
[1:38:00] Daddy's Idols smashing them down right
[1:38:03] and boy oh boy Daddy doesn't like that
[1:38:06] none too much don't do that you can do
[1:38:09] whatever you want but don't smash the
[1:38:10] idol don't smash the family
[1:38:13] Idols right yes you know what they are
[1:38:15] brothers and sisters they're stumbling
[1:38:17] blocks that's right they're stumbling
[1:38:22] blocks and the devil is not afraid to
[1:38:25] get us looking at stumbling blocks and
[1:38:27] the worst part is the devil wants us to
[1:38:29] make stumbling blocks if he can get us
[1:38:31] looking at them he can get us making
[1:38:34] them because we start to see a stumbling
[1:38:37] block what what's a stumbling block we
[1:38:39] can look at anything but you know we we
[1:38:41] just want to go back to the word of God
[1:38:42] we talk about that we know the story of
[1:38:44] bam and baac we know it very clearly
[1:38:46] we're not going to preach the whole
[1:38:48] thing but we know that that's what
[1:38:50] happened with with it and and and baac
[1:38:54] could not get balum to sin he couldn't
[1:38:57] get balum to go and actually curse the
[1:38:59] children of Israel even though he paid
[1:39:01] them and and he he he appreciated him
[1:39:03] and and he did all these wonderful
[1:39:05] things to try and exalt him and and
[1:39:07] every time this Prophet would actually
[1:39:09] he was a backslid prophet every time he
[1:39:11] would go and ask God how can I curse
[1:39:13] these people I want to do something I've
[1:39:14] got a great opportunity God can't you
[1:39:16] see it brother bradam says don't try and
[1:39:18] change God's mind when you pray brothers
[1:39:20] and sister
[1:39:21] he says ask God to change my
[1:39:24] mind when we see a person with a problem
[1:39:28] problem and we pray God change that
[1:39:30] person we're doing it wrong we need to
[1:39:33] say God change my
[1:39:35] heart and when he does that person will
[1:39:39] automatically become different to us but
[1:39:42] balam and baac that whole story if Satan
[1:39:44] can't get you to look at and fall a at
[1:39:47] the front of a a situation or a person
[1:39:49] he'll get you to look at the backside
[1:39:51] because every person and situation has
[1:39:53] got a backside everyone that's the way
[1:39:55] this world is created every single one
[1:39:59] and he loves loves to get people looking
[1:40:02] at the backside of people and you know
[1:40:04] what if you want to see negative you're
[1:40:05] going to see it if that's what you're
[1:40:08] looking for that's what you're going to
[1:40:09] find but I want to encourage you to look
[1:40:11] for the Lord Jesus
[1:40:14] Christ look away to Jesus brothers and
[1:40:17] sisters if you can look away to Jesus
[1:40:20] all the rest of this is just going to be
[1:40:22] static we're going to hear our brother
[1:40:24] say something and we'll say he didn't
[1:40:25] mean that we'll hear our spouse say
[1:40:27] something we'll say she didn't mean that
[1:40:28] well we'll hear our children do
[1:40:30] something and well no they didn't mean
[1:40:32] that they're just children they just
[1:40:33] need to be picked up and dusted off it's
[1:40:35] up to us as parents to do that not to
[1:40:37] kick them out and say they're they're
[1:40:38] not our children anymore yes amen if you
[1:40:42] want to see the bad that's all you're
[1:40:44] going to see brothers and sisters if
[1:40:46] you're always critical it will always
[1:40:49] get in your way yes criticism will
[1:40:52] always be your stumbling block and the
[1:40:55] troubling part is when you have a
[1:40:57] critical spirit because that's what it
[1:40:58] is it's going to cause stumbling blocks
[1:41:00] for other people yes because the
[1:41:02] critical spirit can never shut up right
[1:41:06] and you know it just made me think about
[1:41:08] it there's a time in our life where we
[1:41:10] need to remember brother Cadre Dig's
[1:41:12] Doctrine and brother Cadre Dig's Dogma
[1:41:15] call it forgive me brother but he said
[1:41:18] it very clearly that there is a shut
[1:41:20] your mouth Ministry and we need to get a
[1:41:22] hold of that sometimes and recognize
[1:41:25] that that's the best thing that we could
[1:41:26] ever say is nothing and just go away on
[1:41:29] our knees and pray and ask the Lord to
[1:41:31] deal with the situation because I can't
[1:41:33] do it I can't make it better there's no
[1:41:35] way that I could make it better
[1:41:37] especially if I'm carrying around
[1:41:38] dragging around a critical spirit
[1:41:40] criticizing everything that's going on
[1:41:42] Lord have
[1:41:44] mercy you know turn with me over into
[1:41:47] Genesis
[1:41:48] 31 I just want to
[1:41:51] point something out here
[1:42:11] amen sometimes we don't even have
[1:42:14] mistakes sometimes we can actually
[1:42:16] deliberately do
[1:42:18] things and as children if we're not
[1:42:21] careful if we don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:42:24] on our own then we are liable to wind up
[1:42:27] doing what Rebecca did here I'm just
[1:42:29] going to read one verse here uh for the
[1:42:31] sake of time I'd recommend if you want
[1:42:33] to go and read the whole story but in
[1:42:36] Genesis chapter
[1:42:39] 31 verse
[1:42:42] 30 we have the story of
[1:42:45] laan Rebecca Leah all their
[1:42:49] children and Jacob jaob Jacob finally
[1:42:52] left he got fed up and and left and went
[1:42:56] on his
[1:42:57] way and his wife did something verse 30
[1:43:00] says and now though thou wouldest needs
[1:43:03] be gone because thou SAR longest after
[1:43:07] thy father's house yet wherefore hast
[1:43:10] thou stolen my
[1:43:12] gods yeah so what I want to just point
[1:43:16] out here brothers and sisters is that
[1:43:19] Rebecca she loved
[1:43:21] Jacob a and she wanted to be with him
[1:43:24] they had a conversation about it when he
[1:43:25] told her his revelation God actually
[1:43:27] called him back to the the the Homeland
[1:43:29] he didn't just get up and go and say I'm
[1:43:31] fed up with Laban even though he was fed
[1:43:33] up with his father-in-law in the whole
[1:43:35] story but God called him back
[1:43:37] deliberately and in doing so his wives
[1:43:40] loved him and and wanted him to love
[1:43:43] them and and as they went what was this
[1:43:47] that we're talking what are we talking
[1:43:48] about here is that Rebecca took Daddy's
[1:43:52] Idols Rebecca brought with her her
[1:43:56] parents' gods and you know brothers and
[1:43:58] sisters if we're not careful we can take
[1:44:01] our parents God's and make them our own
[1:44:04] and we'll take them into our marriage
[1:44:06] and it will become a part of our
[1:44:08] marriage it will become a part of the
[1:44:10] fight that we fight when we get into
[1:44:12] stuff at our marriage because one thing
[1:44:14] is for sure for those people who who are
[1:44:16] married you probably don't know already
[1:44:18] I'm just being factious but but you know
[1:44:20] know that it's always there's going to
[1:44:22] be problems there's going to be conflict
[1:44:24] it's the way it works we're human beings
[1:44:26] I I don't know some people might say
[1:44:28] we've never had a conflict before in our
[1:44:30] lives but I would want to dispute that
[1:44:33] and say really
[1:44:37] ever because unfortunately
[1:44:41] when
[1:44:43] Rachel I said Rebeca I apologize I meant
[1:44:45] Rachel forgive me you're 100% right I'm
[1:44:49] wrong
[1:44:52] Rachel but we can actually take idols
[1:44:55] and make them our own when they're
[1:44:58] not she didn't even give her husband the
[1:45:00] opportunity to create his own Idols did
[1:45:03] she and look at what was happening this
[1:45:06] reproach he was searching all of their
[1:45:09] camp and he was hot not only did he take
[1:45:13] off which was you know the way that he
[1:45:16] did it but God called him but he
[1:45:18] actually wound up by vicariously taking
[1:45:22] his gods and and and his idols and and
[1:45:25] so what I want to get to is that that
[1:45:28] she stole her father's
[1:45:31] gods and as the husband he was
[1:45:34] responsible for her and he had no
[1:45:38] idea that's right so if we have one of
[1:45:43] our parents gods in our lives brothers
[1:45:45] and sisters we could be bringing that
[1:45:47] into a marriage which will cause
[1:45:50] conflict
[1:45:51] and one of the other spouses might not
[1:45:53] know it but what we'll do is we'll be
[1:45:56] contending with this image for years
[1:46:00] sometimes decades and not even know it
[1:46:03] but I want to say it today if you've got
[1:46:05] an image other than Jesus Christ in your
[1:46:08] marriage Smash It Down get rid of it
[1:46:12] don't take any of your parents' gods and
[1:46:15] I would say it here I would invite any
[1:46:17] parent here that would disagree with me
[1:46:19] I'm not trying to make a challenge
[1:46:20] but I want to make sure that we're all
[1:46:22] on the same page here that I'm not
[1:46:23] preaching something false what parent
[1:46:26] would want to say that we want to set up
[1:46:28] an idol for our children to carry around
[1:46:31] we want our children to get to Jesus
[1:46:34] Christ don't look at me even as a parent
[1:46:37] there comes a point in time children
[1:46:39] where you have the the the the point of
[1:46:41] accountability where you have to know
[1:46:43] Jesus Christ yourself
[1:46:46] yes cuz one time in my life in my
[1:46:49] family's life Daddy might not be here
[1:46:52] you're going to have to make it on your
[1:46:54] own you're going to have to trust in the
[1:46:56] Lord with all of your heart and lean not
[1:46:59] unto your own understanding when you've
[1:47:01] got difficult decisions to make oh but
[1:47:04] in all of your ways acknowledge Him and
[1:47:06] what will happen he'll direct your
[1:47:08] Pathways he'll show you the
[1:47:12] way as children we can desire to keep a
[1:47:15] family Idol and make it supersede the
[1:47:19] word and I I just had that word keep
[1:47:22] coming back to me it's not out of the
[1:47:23] scripture and I don't even think it's in
[1:47:25] the message but I got into beekeeping
[1:47:27] this year and some things the natural
[1:47:29] they they kind of go along with the
[1:47:31] spiritual and if anybody understands
[1:47:33] what what happens in a beehive is
[1:47:35] sometimes the queen excuse me the queen
[1:47:38] bee doesn't do what she's supposed to do
[1:47:40] and God has created these bees to
[1:47:42] understand that if that queen bee isn't
[1:47:44] performing then they will actually go
[1:47:46] and hatch out another bee and actually
[1:47:49] feed it what they call Royal gel B and
[1:47:50] they will create a superseding cell and
[1:47:54] and what that is is another queen bee
[1:47:56] they're raising up to supersede the
[1:47:58] queen that's not
[1:48:00] performing if we have something in our
[1:48:02] lives that's superseding the word of God
[1:48:05] brothers and sisters we need to make
[1:48:07] sure that we get rid of it amen nothing
[1:48:10] should supersede the word of God the
[1:48:12] word of God should supersede everything
[1:48:14] else in our
[1:48:16] lives and the meaning of supersede so
[1:48:18] you understand what my heart is is to
[1:48:20] take place of a person or thing
[1:48:23] previously in Authority or in
[1:48:26] use we don't want an idol to start
[1:48:29] superseding in our lives start
[1:48:31] superseding the word of God start
[1:48:33] superseding what we know we should
[1:48:35] do we want it to be the word of God yes
[1:48:39] amen but we know it that God will not be
[1:48:41] in a relationship with someone who is
[1:48:43] not completely true to him he just won't
[1:48:47] he knows when we're bluffing right he
[1:48:50] knows knows when we're willing to hold
[1:48:51] on to an idol he knows when we're
[1:48:53] willing to say you know what I believe
[1:48:55] but I only go so far he knows that and
[1:48:58] so does Satan and Satan loves it when we
[1:49:01] stay there when we stay there that's
[1:49:02] where we become the most miserable
[1:49:04] people in the world but when we're so
[1:49:06] glad that we can say we're one of them
[1:49:08] I'm sold
[1:49:09] out you know brother Ram tells that
[1:49:12] story about how he asked that sister
[1:49:14] sister how long have you had the Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost how how many people get uneasy if
[1:49:20] somebody says that to you how long you
[1:49:21] had the Holy Ghost
[1:49:23] for he says that sister she said oh Lord
[1:49:27] she gets excited and says I remember
[1:49:29] I've had the Holy Ghost for 75 years
[1:49:31] she's 80 plus years old I've had the
[1:49:33] Holy Ghost for so long in my life I
[1:49:35] remember exactly where and when and I
[1:49:37] remember when my life changed when God
[1:49:39] revealed that to me it should cause
[1:49:41] excitement it shouldn't cause uneasiness
[1:49:43] it shouldn't make us un unsure it
[1:49:46] shouldn't make us weary it should give
[1:49:48] us the ability to say Amen I know I know
[1:49:51] I might not know exactly where or when
[1:49:53] but I know I got it and how do I know I
[1:49:56] got it because I say Amen to the word
[1:49:58] and that amen doesn't mean that I just
[1:50:00] go to church it means that I live
[1:50:04] it we will say we know
[1:50:08] him but not necessarily able to say it
[1:50:12] intimately we read it earlier you know 2
[1:50:14] Corinthians 11:2 for I'm jealous over
[1:50:16] you with a Godly
[1:50:18] jealousy can you imagine a Godly
[1:50:23] jealousy that's not religious jealousy
[1:50:25] by the way that's not saying that the
[1:50:28] pope is going to send one of the guards
[1:50:30] the Swiss guards to our door and that's
[1:50:32] not saying the deacons are coming around
[1:50:34] that's not godly
[1:50:36] jealousy Godly jealousy is a
[1:50:38] supernatural jealousy and and he will
[1:50:41] not allow us to go certain ways he will
[1:50:43] not allow us to do certain things and I
[1:50:46] would say this Godly jealousy would get
[1:50:48] in the way of a prophet's mad
[1:50:50] Madness who wants to go and actually
[1:50:53] curse the children of Israel and and
[1:50:55] actually have a donkey speak to him
[1:50:58] Godly jealousy will get in the way of
[1:51:00] another prophet and his Madness and how
[1:51:04] a group of boys what did they do they
[1:51:06] thrashed him they smashed in his face
[1:51:08] because he walked home a girl one day
[1:51:11] carried her books for her and they
[1:51:12] called him a Kentucky squab and what did
[1:51:15] that Prophet do he ran home and got the
[1:51:16] 22 long rifle down and he ran and he
[1:51:19] made an amb Bush and he put what was it
[1:51:21] 16 shots into that gun and he pulled the
[1:51:24] trigger on every single one of them and
[1:51:25] not one of them fired Godly jealousy
[1:51:28] will get in the way of our Madness in
[1:51:31] our lives Godly jealousy will save us
[1:51:34] from getting into car accidents that
[1:51:36] will destroy us Godly jealousy will get
[1:51:39] us to the place where we can actually
[1:51:41] have the word of God supersede all of
[1:51:44] the idols that would be raised up in our
[1:51:46] lives every one of us has them smash
[1:51:49] them them down brothers and sisters
[1:51:51] don't create a high place for them don't
[1:51:53] don't create a comfortable spot for an
[1:51:54] idol to get in the way of the word of
[1:51:57] God examine Our Lives get rid of
[1:52:01] them I just was thinking about this the
[1:52:04] the chased virgin what does that word
[1:52:07] mean
[1:52:09] chased chased
[1:52:12] virgin I believe it's a a a virgin is is
[1:52:17] clean that's innocent modest and perfect
[1:52:21] amen chased clean and
[1:52:25] pure I just think it's so
[1:52:28] beautiful to look at the the word of God
[1:52:31] and to just see how how the wording
[1:52:33] actually is for us it was stored up for
[1:52:36] a season brothers and sisters we've been
[1:52:38] given this word of God and and we know
[1:52:41] that there is such a tremendous
[1:52:43] Revelation that's Unleashed to this
[1:52:44] world in the day in which we live
[1:52:47] sometimes it's almost hard to even bear
[1:52:49] it's difficult to even comprehend how
[1:52:52] God would choose us to be able to
[1:52:54] comprehend but we know that it says it
[1:52:56] in the word of God that we would be able
[1:52:57] to comprehend what is the height and the
[1:53:00] depth and the length and the breadth of
[1:53:02] it that we would be able to understand
[1:53:05] the the fullness of the word in our day
[1:53:08] you know brothers and sisters true
[1:53:09] Revelation is identifiable it's not just
[1:53:12] something that we say we can say it many
[1:53:14] times I know I've been guilty of saying
[1:53:16] it many times I know I've been guilty of
[1:53:18] when people start to bring out quotes
[1:53:20] and talk about things that I want to be
[1:53:22] able to bring out quotes and talk about
[1:53:23] things too but you know what are we
[1:53:26] living that is the critical factor in
[1:53:28] our lives it's important to be able to
[1:53:30] pour from vessel to vessel we have to be
[1:53:32] able to do that but not just say it live
[1:53:35] it amen true Revelation in our lives
[1:53:38] brothers and sisters is
[1:53:40] identifiable if we're not observing the
[1:53:43] virtues in our lives then we need to get
[1:53:46] back to the altar turn with me over to
[1:53:51] Corinthians let's go to 1 Corinthians
[1:53:53] chapter
[1:54:04] 13 when we have true Revelation about
[1:54:07] the word for our day it's not just that
[1:54:08] God sent a prophet it's that God sent a
[1:54:11] prophet and I've met the god that that
[1:54:13] Prophet actually brought the god that
[1:54:17] that Prophet was actually sending the
[1:54:19] invitation to I have received that
[1:54:21] invitation and I know that God he is my
[1:54:24] God why is it not because of something I
[1:54:26] say not because of somewhere that I go
[1:54:28] because I see these virtues living out
[1:54:31] in my
[1:54:32] life in 1 Corinthians Chapter
[1:54:36] 13 Verse one says though I speak with
[1:54:39] the tongues of men and
[1:54:42] angels and have not charity I am become
[1:54:46] as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:54:51] symbol I just want to bring up that
[1:54:54] first slide there brother the
[1:54:57] picture just want to point this
[1:55:01] out this is what we
[1:55:03] are in in in my
[1:55:07] visualization if we actually are just
[1:55:09] talking about the word but we're not
[1:55:10] living it
[1:55:12] out little monkey with some tinkling
[1:55:16] symbols this is what we are this is what
[1:55:18] the word of God says
[1:55:21] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:55:22] and angels maybe I actually speak in
[1:55:24] tongues maybe I see the gifts of God
[1:55:26] manifesting in my lives but if I don't
[1:55:28] have charity what's charity charity is
[1:55:30] God charity is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:33] that person that we were talking about a
[1:55:35] few minutes ago living out through our
[1:55:37] lives though I speak with the tongues of
[1:55:39] men and angels I and have not charity I
[1:55:42] am become as a sounding brass or a
[1:55:43] tinkling symbol now I want to just press
[1:55:46] pause there and I want to go to the next
[1:55:47] slide and I want to say this this is
[1:55:49] where we're supposed to be brothers and
[1:55:51] sisters not just that one little monkey
[1:55:53] making a little bit of sound over in the
[1:55:54] corner he's quoting the quotes and he
[1:55:56] knows the Bible and he goes to church
[1:55:58] and everything else does it all just
[1:55:59] right but he doesn't actually live it he
[1:56:03] does something else that's where we're
[1:56:05] supposed to be brothers and sisters
[1:56:07] every one of us as an instrument with
[1:56:10] our position looking at the conductor
[1:56:12] knowing that when we play we play
[1:56:14] together and we make one sound we play
[1:56:17] the song the conductor is leading us to
[1:56:19] play brother Bram talks about Peter and
[1:56:21] the Wolf in that great Symphony and he
[1:56:23] calls it sympathy but you know it's a
[1:56:25] symphony and we know that we all are
[1:56:28] looking for our queue that that
[1:56:30] conductor is going to point at us and we
[1:56:32] need to know what our time is we need to
[1:56:34] know how to read the sheet music the
[1:56:36] only way we're going to be able to read
[1:56:37] his sheet music is to have the Holy
[1:56:39] Ghost Inside of us to interpret that
[1:56:42] amen but that's where we're supposed to
[1:56:43] be not that little monkey making sound
[1:56:45] with a tinkling symbol brothers and
[1:56:47] sisters with all the quotes and notes
[1:56:48] and all the stuff
[1:56:50] tenure in the message that ain't going
[1:56:51] to do it we're that tinkling symbol
[1:56:54] verse two says and though I have the
[1:56:55] gift of
[1:56:57] Prophecy and understand all the
[1:56:59] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:57:03] have all Faith so that I could remove
[1:57:05] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:57:08] nothing now remember we're not talking
[1:57:10] about charity to say oh we've got the
[1:57:12] poor people we need to feed the poor
[1:57:13] people we're talking about charity as
[1:57:15] the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in
[1:57:17] our life amen if I don't have Jesus in
[1:57:20] my life if I don't have the Lord for
[1:57:22] today according to the word for today in
[1:57:25] my life I am nothing and though I bestow
[1:57:28] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:57:30] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:57:33] charity it profiteth me
[1:57:36] nothing it makes the most miserable
[1:57:38] Christian doesn't it it makes the most
[1:57:41] miserable person in the world Amen when
[1:57:44] we're almost there but we're not quite
[1:57:47] there for some reason there's something
[1:57:49] stopping us from going all the way and
[1:57:52] usually it's an
[1:57:54] idol usually it's something that we're
[1:57:56] just not willing to smash we're not
[1:57:58] willing to say whoa I'm just going to
[1:58:00] let go of everything that I know and let
[1:58:02] the Lord Jesus Christ drive my life but
[1:58:05] that's truly by Li living by faith
[1:58:07] brothers and sisters is where we do
[1:58:10] that verse three and though I bestow my
[1:58:13] go verse four charity suffereth long and
[1:58:17] is kind these are are the attributes
[1:58:20] that we want to look for charity
[1:58:22] suffereth long we know the Lord is
[1:58:24] longsuffering isn't he amen and he's
[1:58:27] patient and he's
[1:58:30] gentle charity suffereth long and is
[1:58:33] kind charity envieth not charity
[1:58:37] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[1:58:42] doth not behave itself
[1:58:44] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:58:48] easily Prov provoked thinketh no evil
[1:58:52] amen rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[1:58:56] rejoiceth in the
[1:58:58] truth beareth all things believeth all
[1:59:01] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:59:05] things charity never
[1:59:09] faileth we know we've read that I just
[1:59:11] want to point that out the statue of the
[1:59:13] perfect man if all these things be in
[1:59:14] you you shall not
[1:59:16] fall charity never fail if you've got
[1:59:20] God inside of you if you've got the Holy
[1:59:21] Ghost brothers and sisters you'll never
[1:59:23] fail you'll never
[1:59:25] fall you'll fall down you'll trip and
[1:59:27] fall sure but you'll get right back up
[1:59:29] and you'll go amen we'll trip and fall
[1:59:31] we'll stumble we're in this flesh this
[1:59:34] flesh isn't what was redeemed remember
[1:59:36] this flesh is the pest house that we're
[1:59:38] trapped
[1:59:39] in we have a new body already waiting
[1:59:42] for us hallelujah and if we're willing
[1:59:44] to get the token in our lives we will go
[1:59:46] on to that body amen charity never fails
[1:59:50] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:59:52] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:59:55] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:59:58] it shall vanish
[2:00:01] away I just can't help but think you
[2:00:03] know when we look back on our lives
[2:00:05] someday if the Lord should T if we find
[2:00:08] ourselves in a place where where we're
[2:00:12] just alone in a bed or in a
[2:00:14] chair and we look back on our lives are
[2:00:18] we going to be satisfied ified that we
[2:00:19] gave our all to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:23] that we actually did everything that we
[2:00:24] should according to the word of God or
[2:00:26] are we going to think that I should have
[2:00:27] treated my wife better or I should have
[2:00:29] done something more for my children or I
[2:00:32] could have done more for the body of
[2:00:34] Jesus Christ I I could have actually
[2:00:37] done this but I chose to selfishly do
[2:00:39] that are we going to look back and say
[2:00:41] those words or are we going to say wow
[2:00:44] praise God he chose me to do these
[2:00:46] things and I just wish I could have done
[2:00:47] more I know that I did did some but I
[2:00:49] really wish I did more where are we
[2:00:52] going to be because all the rest of it
[2:00:53] we just read about is going to vanish
[2:00:55] away everything is going to disappear
[2:00:57] brothers and sisters all of our money
[2:00:58] all of our investments all the
[2:00:59] portfolios all of our business
[2:01:01] everything that we've got all of our
[2:01:03] even our images all of it will disappear
[2:01:06] the only thing that will remain is the
[2:01:08] word of God if we got the word of God in
[2:01:09] us then we will remain for we know in
[2:01:13] part and we prophesy in part but that
[2:01:15] when that which is perfect has come and
[2:01:17] I can tell you brothers and sisters that
[2:01:19] which is perfect is come Hallelujah he's
[2:01:22] here the prophet was here to declare
[2:01:24] he's here and he said that for when we
[2:01:27] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[2:01:29] when that which is perfect is come then
[2:01:31] that which is in part shall be done away
[2:01:34] so when I was a child I spake as a child
[2:01:37] maybe I didn't quite understand all
[2:01:39] these things but I don't have to
[2:01:40] understand these things because I know
[2:01:42] that he understands those things and he
[2:01:44] the spirit of truth will lead me and
[2:01:45] guide me into all truth I I was a child
[2:01:48] I spake as a child they understood as a
[2:01:49] child they thought as a child oh but
[2:01:52] when I became a man when I became mature
[2:01:54] according to the word of God when I
[2:01:56] became the stature of a perfect man when
[2:01:59] that's this life of Jesus Christ this
[2:02:01] one started Living out through me I put
[2:02:03] away the childish things the only thing
[2:02:05] I wanted to do was lay down my life for
[2:02:07] my family the only thing I wanted to do
[2:02:08] was lay down my life for the Gospel of
[2:02:10] Jesus Christ I wasn't interested in
[2:02:12] chasing the childish things anymore I
[2:02:14] wanted to be a man I wanted to serve the
[2:02:16] Lord with all my heart for we know
[2:02:19] now we see through a glass Darkly this
[2:02:21] is Paul speaking here right now in their
[2:02:24] time while he's saying this they were
[2:02:25] speaking through a glass Darkly but then
[2:02:28] face to face brothers and sisters
[2:02:31] when right now the prophet said he's
[2:02:36] here we know that cloud was for a
[2:02:40] purpose but then face to face now I know
[2:02:43] in part but then shall I know even as
[2:02:47] also I am know
[2:02:52] even as you are known amen amen the Lord
[2:02:55] Jesus Christ Living out through
[2:02:58] you I think it's just so beautiful and
[2:03:01] now abideth faith hope and charity these
[2:03:03] three but the greatest of these is
[2:03:06] Charity the Lord Jesus Christ Living out
[2:03:08] through US amen you know brothers and
[2:03:11] sisters we have we have to be seeing
[2:03:13] these virtues in our lives and if if we
[2:03:15] don't see them in our lives I'm here to
[2:03:17] say today

[2:03:22] something different and I want to judge

[2:03:43] ability to get to the altar Before Time

[2:03:55] altar have I got a an image in my life
[2:03:57] Lord take it from me if I do
[2:04:01] right because who wants to keep an image

[2:05:04] humble makes you forgiving we're not
[2:05:08] constantly thinking about the past and
[2:05:09] how that person did that and I'm going
[2:05:11] to bring it up and use it as a club and
[2:05:13] as leverage because every time we get
[2:05:14] into a discussion I'm just can't get
[2:05:16] past that thing you know what that thing
[2:05:18] is thing's an idol smash it down don't

[2:05:29] they pull down could they pull whiskers
[2:05:31] from your face if you had them out there
[2:05:34] jerk them out and spit in your face when
[2:05:37] you had the power to call Legions of
[2:05:39] angels could you do that for the love of
[2:05:41] the people that was spitting in your
[2:05:43] face could you do it if somebody just
[2:05:46] walked up to you and said hey you
[2:05:47] hypocrite and smacked you on the side of
[2:05:49] the face could you pray for their
[2:05:51] forgiveness now that's where trust test
[2:05:55] whether you got the Holy Spirit or
[2:05:58] not yes we could say Amen to the word
[2:06:01] all day long but let's talk about the
[2:06:04] real world now let's talk about when we
[2:06:07] get into the pressures of life and
[2:06:09] someone cuts us off and someone does
[2:06:11] this and someone does that because the
[2:06:13] devil's going to come brother Bram says
[2:06:16] he's got one punch he's enti to one
[2:06:19] punch to every single person every
[2:06:21] believer he's got one punch now what's
[2:06:24] going to happen to us when he takes that
[2:06:26] punch now that's where trust test
[2:06:29] whether you got the Holy Spirit or not
[2:06:30] see when somebody says something evil
[2:06:32] against someone sometimes that claims to
[2:06:34] have the Holy Spirit I'll get even with
[2:06:36] her if it takes my last day see now
[2:06:38] that's where you check about your Holy
[2:06:41] Spirit see blessed are you when man
[2:06:43] shall say all manner of evil against you
[2:06:45] falsely for my name's sake but you go
[2:06:47] get even with them no rejoice and be
[2:06:50] exceedingly glad for so persecuted they
[2:06:52] the prophets which were before you see
[2:06:55] when someone says evil about you say
[2:06:56] something good amen if you can't say
[2:06:59] something good about them then don't say
[2:07:02] nothing just let it go see and then when
[2:07:05] you get to yourself pray for
[2:07:08] them pray for
[2:07:10] them you
[2:07:11] know sometimes brothers and sisters
[2:07:13] that's not just brothers and sisters
[2:07:15] sometimes that's parents to
[2:07:17] children sometimes that's children to
[2:07:20] parents sometimes that's wife to husband
[2:07:22] and husband to wife brother to sister
[2:07:25] sometimes it's that way but we need to
[2:07:28] do
[2:07:28] that and you know when you get the Holy
[2:07:30] Ghost it's not something we need to do
[2:07:33] you're just going to do it how does the
[2:07:35] Sheep grow wool it just does how does
[2:07:38] the dove stay white well it just does
[2:07:41] because that's what's on the inside of
[2:07:42] it how do we behave like Christ well we
[2:07:45] just actually let him live out through
[2:07:47] us and we're willing to Smash down all
[2:07:49] of these Idols that we have in our lives
[2:07:51] so that he can live and you know what
[2:07:53] he's just waiting to see us do it he's
[2:07:54] not going to come and send a bulldozer
[2:07:56] like they have going into Gaza now he's
[2:07:58] not going to send an armored armored
[2:08:00] piercing covered personnel carrier to
[2:08:03] come in and Smash down all of our Idols
[2:08:05] he's going to wait for us to do
[2:08:08] it but brothers and sisters why wait
[2:08:10] till whenever I want to encourage us do
[2:08:13] it now amen he's here it wasn't just
[2:08:17] something that the prophet said
[2:08:19] if we've come to church believing in a
[2:08:20] living God believing in Hebrews 138
[2:08:23] brothers and sisters he's here to meet
[2:08:24] all of our
[2:08:26] needs if we just need a little top up of
[2:08:28] the Holy Ghost he's here if we need
[2:08:30] forgiveness he's here if we need to see
[2:08:33] something change in our lives he's here
[2:08:36] we don't have to go searching for him
[2:08:38] he's here right
[2:08:42] now do you believe do you now believe
[2:08:45] 1955 talking about love here
[2:08:50] but the BAM says now I'd just like to
[2:08:51] tell you what my secret of the
[2:08:54] greatest what are you you'd how how
[2:08:57] you'd like me to tell you tonight what I
[2:08:59] think is the greatest most powerful vo
[2:09:03] Force there is on
[2:09:05] Earth if you want to see him move on a
[2:09:08] situation brothers and sisters it's not
[2:09:10] going to be by force not by our force is
[2:09:13] not going to be by jumping up and down
[2:09:15] and screaming and shouting and dumping
[2:09:17] oil and and having everybody lay hands
[2:09:19] on and do all of the mighty wonderful
[2:09:22] religious acts all the religious motion
[2:09:24] David did it and still a man's life was
[2:09:26] taken right he wasn't following the word
[2:09:29] of God but if we follow the word of God
[2:09:32] we will see him move in our lives
[2:09:33] brothers and sisters and what's going to
[2:09:36] take to conquer all of this stuff is
[2:09:38] love he says would you like me to tell
[2:09:40] you about it a few minutes you might not
[2:09:43] love me so well after this cuz I will
[2:09:45] just tell you all the mightiest for on
[2:09:47] there is is on Earth is love that's
[2:09:49] exactly there's nothing will break down
[2:09:52] love no matter what it is isn't that
[2:09:55] wonderful 1 Corinthians 13 we just read
[2:09:58] about it if you want to see all of those
[2:10:00] things smashed down all of the problems
[2:10:02] in our lives not erased but smoothed out
[2:10:06] so that we can get through them so that
[2:10:08] we can maybe grow closer together with
[2:10:10] one another as brothers and sisters or
[2:10:12] as husbands and wives or as parents and
[2:10:15] children if you want to see that happen
[2:10:17] if you want to see relationships grow
[2:10:20] then pour on love brothers and sisters
[2:10:23] iron fisted tough love that's for I
[2:10:26] would say other people not the Bride of
[2:10:27] Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:10:29] is going to exude the life of Jesus
[2:10:32] Christ the people that were the most
[2:10:35] ridiculous Sinners are the ones that he
[2:10:37] went to and did he condemn them and
[2:10:39] smash them and belittle them no he said
[2:10:42] the one that you're talking with if you
[2:10:44] asked him for a drink oh my the five
[2:10:48] husbands that you've got are not they're
[2:10:50] not yours and the one you're with Now
[2:10:51] isn't yours
[2:10:53] either an
[2:10:54] adulteress caught in the act thrown at
[2:10:57] his
[2:11:00] feet 56 0426 Jesus Christ is saying
[2:11:04] yesterday today and forever amen if you
[2:11:07] love him you know love is the greatest
[2:11:11] force that we have the most powerful
[2:11:14] force do you believe that love will just
[2:11:18] do things that nothing else will
[2:11:22] do nothing else will
[2:11:25] do he said it how will the world know
[2:11:29] that you love me that you go to a
[2:11:32] message church that you claim that God
[2:11:34] sent a
[2:11:36] prophet that you know the
[2:11:38] quotes that you go and you witness on
[2:11:40] the
[2:11:41] streets it's that you have love one for
[2:11:45] another but when we've got something in
[2:11:47] our life where we just can't can't stand
[2:11:48] to see another brother we can't be close
[2:11:50] to them there's something wrong with our
[2:11:53] experience because we don't truly love
[2:11:55] him we know that John talks about it and
[2:11:56] it's pretty hard I'm not going to get
[2:11:57] into it but he says if we claim that we
[2:11:59] love him but we hate our brother we're a
[2:12:04] liar I think love is the most powerful
[2:12:07] force that the world has because God is
[2:12:10] love did I give you this one 57
[2:12:13] 0519 yeah sorry I jumped ahead this one
[2:12:18] is called love this is the message love
[2:12:21] in 1957 guess what he's talking about I
[2:12:24] think love is the most powerful force
[2:12:26] that the world has because God is love
[2:12:29] and there's no more power more powerful
[2:12:32] force than God and love is one of the
[2:12:34] greatest things that I could speak
[2:12:37] of and I'll say it today I think it's
[2:12:39] one of the greatest things that I could
[2:12:41] speak of it's one of the greatest things
[2:12:42] that you could speak ofen is love and
[2:12:45] not just love as we know it not not
[2:12:48] ailio love not love in our feelings and
[2:12:50] our emotions and oh I love this person
[2:12:53] and I love this thing no agapo love the
[2:12:56] the love that transcends all of this
[2:12:58] emotional state all of this spiritual
[2:13:01] state that goes right into the heart of
[2:13:04] the believer right to the word of God
[2:13:06] right to the throne of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:08] Christ that's the love we're talking
[2:13:09] about brothers and sisters where it's
[2:13:12] Jesus Christ himself living out through
[2:13:14] us the spirit the Holy Ghost 5708 6 God
[2:13:19] projecting his love and I just think
[2:13:21] it's so beautiful because this quote was
[2:13:22] already in there when you were singing
[2:13:24] that song the love of God shown to this
[2:13:26] world yeah the Believers the life of
[2:13:30] Jesus Christ Living out through each one
[2:13:32] of our Lives as we go forwards as we
[2:13:34] treat our spouses as we treat our
[2:13:36] children as we treat our brothers and
[2:13:38] sisters this love is what identifies the
[2:13:41] Holy Ghost In Our
[2:13:43] Lives it'll run a woman mother right
[2:13:45] into the flames of fire after her baby
[2:13:48] if she knows she's plunging herself to
[2:13:50] death amen there's nothing more strong
[2:13:53] than love love will make you trust you
[2:13:56] might go and and know that you belong to
[2:13:59] the greatest Church in all the provinces
[2:14:01] of Canada you might know that you're the
[2:14:04] charter member of the greatest Church in
[2:14:06] the nation and then you would do the
[2:14:08] things that you would not do if you
[2:14:10] belong to a little Mission somewhere
[2:14:12] some corner and and had the love of God
[2:14:14] in your heart he says love has no fear
[2:14:18] love casts out fear and I notice in my
[2:14:21] meetings so much that when I come into
[2:14:23] the people one of the greatest things I
[2:14:25] find among them is fear brothers and
[2:14:28] sisters don't be
[2:14:30] afraid because love casts out fear I'll
[2:14:33] call the
[2:14:34] musicians we don't have any reason to be
[2:14:36] afraid brothers and sisters o other than
[2:14:39] we know the word of God is here and we
[2:14:40] have an idol in our life we have
[2:14:42] something that's getting in the way of
[2:14:44] this word of God taking the full effect
[2:14:46] in our lives I want to challenge just
[2:14:48] this morning if you got something don't
[2:14:49] don't be embarrassed say Lord help me
[2:14:53] and Smash It To The Ground take it and
[2:14:55] throw it down we know that brother
[2:14:57] brandham talked about those those
[2:14:58] blanket natives that they had the
[2:15:00] situation where they were presented with
[2:15:02] the word of God through the Vindicated
[2:15:04] prophet and he said if God will do this
[2:15:06] Mighty miracle if you will see that this
[2:15:08] is the god that I bring to you will you
[2:15:11] smash down those Idols they were packing
[2:15:13] and they all smashed them down because
[2:15:15] they saw the life of Jesus Christ
[2:15:17] through that man and I want to say if he
[2:15:19] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:15:21] then brothers and sisters don't pack it
[2:15:23] another day don't pack it another hour
[2:15:25] if you got something in your life smash
[2:15:26] it down let him live out through you
[2:15:30] take the challenge see if God won't
[2:15:32] manifest in your life in such a way like
[2:15:35] maybe he never has
[2:15:39] before love has no fear brothers and
[2:15:42] sisters don't be
[2:15:44] afraid love casts out fear
[2:15:48] we have the ability to recognize that if
[2:15:50] we're afraid then maybe we just don't
[2:15:53] have this love that we're talking about
[2:15:55] in our lives maybe stand with me as we
[2:15:58] close brother brandom says that what
[2:16:00] makes fear is a lack of
[2:16:02] confidence if you lack confidence it'll
[2:16:04] make you
[2:16:06] fear sometimes we can have confidence in
[2:16:08] the wrong places and if we do that then
[2:16:11] we're going to be afraid and I would say
[2:16:13] if you do have confidence in the wrong
[2:16:15] place you should be afraid
[2:16:18] H but I want to say take your confidence
[2:16:21] and put it from wherever that is if it's
[2:16:23] in your idol and in something that you
[2:16:25] know and you're just not willing to let
[2:16:26] go of it's the way I was raised and I
[2:16:28] know that I know okay if it lines up
[2:16:31] with the word of God that's great keep
[2:16:33] on with it if you love the way that
[2:16:36] we've read about love today then keep on
[2:16:38] with it but if it's not according to the
[2:16:40] word that we talked about then there's
[2:16:42] something wrong with
[2:16:43] it I want to say smash it down it
[2:16:47] shouldn't make us afraid put your
[2:16:48] confidence in Christ if you lack
[2:16:51] confidence it'll make you
[2:16:53] fear but if you love it casts away that
[2:16:57] fear and that's the way God wants his
[2:17:00] church not so many as charter
[2:17:03] members F upstanding citizens he wants
[2:17:06] members that's loyal and loves and
[2:17:09] believes and has confidence in who not
[2:17:12] the pastor has confidence in who not the
[2:17:15] deacons has confidence in him yes him
[2:17:18] and him alone brothers and
[2:17:21] sisters one more quote 1959
[2:17:26] 1223 you know what an idol is in our
[2:17:29] lives
[2:17:31] ultimately it's a
[2:17:34] devil it's a
[2:17:36] Tormentor and he's going to do
[2:17:37] everything he can to get in the way of
[2:17:39] that life living out through US brother
[2:17:41] bradam says it in 1959 1223 questions
[2:17:44] and answers you never cast Out cast a
[2:17:49] devil out by the wrong
[2:17:52] attitude we know that he says it in the
[2:17:54] message of the hour the right mental
[2:17:56] attitude towards any one of the promises
[2:17:58] of God will bring them to pass the only
[2:18:01] right mental attitude we're ever going
[2:18:02] to have is the Holy Ghost mental
[2:18:04] attitude in our lives which is going to
[2:18:06] equate to love which is going to exude
[2:18:09] the attributes that we've already spoke
[2:18:11] about
[2:18:12] today it takes love to do
[2:18:14] that and love is the most powerful force
[2:18:18] that there is in the world now if you
[2:18:20] notice a devil is always
[2:18:25] hate hate is of the
[2:18:28] devil and when people hate
[2:18:30] someone remember it is a terrible devil
[2:18:34] to despise or dislike you mustn't do
[2:18:38] that amen love is the only thing that's
[2:18:41] going to conquer in our lives brothers
[2:18:42] and
[2:18:43] sisters and he is the same yesterday
[2:18:46] today and forever and he is here if you
[2:18:49] want to see a change in your life it's
[2:18:52] not too late the Rapture hasn't gone

[2:18:58] won't let's go to him in prayer gracious
