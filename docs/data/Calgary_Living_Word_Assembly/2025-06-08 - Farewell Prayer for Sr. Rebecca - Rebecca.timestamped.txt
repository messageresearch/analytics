[0:00] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this
[0:02] morning we are truly honored and
[0:03] privileged, Lord, to stand in your
[0:05] presence, Lord, with your daughter.
[0:08] Father, we're so thankful for her
[0:10] testimony, Lord Jesus, of her life here
[0:13] in this assembly, Lord. I remember back
[0:16] to when she was here with her parents,
[0:18] Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, and you've seen
[0:21] fit since then to take both of her
[0:23] parents home, Lord. Father, now you've
[0:26] granted her the desire of her heart,
[0:28] Lord Jesus, to go on and become a wife,
[0:31] Father. Lord Jesus, what an honor,
[0:35] Father, we pray that you would just
[0:36] bless her abundantly, Father, that you
[0:39] would grant her, continue granting her
[0:41] the desires of her heart, Lord Jesus.
[0:44] Father, that she would just be a good
[0:46] wife to her husband and that her husband
[0:47] would be a strong leader, oh Father, not
[0:50] naturally, but spiritually and
[0:52] naturally, Lord. Father, we're so
[0:54] thankful for the pattern that you've
[0:55] given us in your word, Lord Jesus. We
[0:58] have a direction. We have leadership,
[1:00] Lord. Oh, Father. And we pray that
[1:03] Sister Rebecca and Brother Victor would
[1:05] just keep you first in their life every
[1:07] day of their lives, Lord. That their
[1:09] marriage would be centered around you,
[1:11] Father. And Lord, if it be your will for
[1:13] them to have children, Father, that you
[1:16] would grant it to them in the name of
[1:17] Jesus Christ. Oh, Father, and that they
[1:20] would raise them in the fear and the
[1:21] admonition of you, Lord, if you should
[1:24] terry, Father, we're so thankful for
[1:26] Sister Rebecca's life and her testimony
[1:28] and the gifts you've placed in there. We
[1:30] pray that you would just keep your hand
[1:32] upon her as she travels, Lord, every
[1:35] single day of her life. And Father,
[1:37] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[1:38] when we hear the testimony after the
[1:40] wedding. Bless their wedding. Bless
[1:42] their ceremony. Bless the church they
[1:44] will attend, Father. And Lord, we pray
[1:46] for their sisters, Lord. Her sisters
[1:48] here in Calgary. They'll miss her, Lord.
[1:51] Oh, Father, the body here will miss her,
[1:53] Father. But we're so thankful for your
[1:55] goodness to us, Lord. We just pray,
[1:58] Lord. We ask all these things now in
[2:00] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:03] Amen. Amen. And as a body here, we just
[2:07] like to present you with this as a
[2:09] wedding gift, a token of our
[2:11] appreciation to you, sister.
[2:13] [Applause]
[2:26] [Music]
