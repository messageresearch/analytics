Our most precious heavenly father, what an honor and a privilege given to us to assemble here this evening, Wednesday evening, having a place to go to recharge our energies, Lord. Father, this evening we've come to charge our batteries. Sometimes father we go through the week with many many many troubles with many many situations. Sometimes even with doubt if we are believers but we have a hope in you. Father when we meet like this we [music] come to bring those questions that we could not have answers that the devil throws at us. We have a place to come &gt;&gt; and you always meet us. You always come on the scene to answer them for us. Lord, when we see our brothers and our sisters, we have hope and we believe that each and everyone has the same testimony. &gt;&gt; The devil is not happy to see us going about our duty. So he always comes around and throw things that we don't need in our lives. As we come here this evening, Father, it is my prayer that you move from person to person this evening. And those questions that are lingering, you'll provide answer. Whatever forms, but I believe that the word that is about to come, there is an answer in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; May you have a place in our hearts. May you have a place for us to receive that word that is about to come. I want to thank you Lord for each and every person that is represented here this evening. Lord &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; they came from various homes. They came through whatever situation. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord &gt;&gt; they are here Lord to feed upon the word. May you move from person to person, from pew to pew, that by the time we get home, we have answers to the questions that we have, &gt;&gt; Lord. And I pray for my son as lead he's leading songs this evening that you help him, Lord. Calm his nerves, Lord, so that he can bring songs of Zion to your people &gt;&gt; as we prepare to receive your word. &gt;&gt; Once again, our pastor has labored &gt;&gt; throughout the whole week to bring your mind May we catch whatever the Lord you have prepared for us. Lord, we shall be careful to give you thanks. Once again, we commit the service from the beginning to the end. May you bless it for in Jesus name that we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Welcome to the house of the Lord on a Wednesday midweek service for a little spiritual recharge. We just have uh one two prayer requests we'd like to bring tonight. But first, we have one praise report and that is for brother Peter Hoffer, brother Peter Hoffer's dad to go home &gt;&gt; when the doctors said there was no hope. I think that's literally what they said and I believe today he went home. &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for that. [applause] [applause] continue to hold the family in prayer and just trust the Lord will continue to [music] have his will &gt;&gt; in their life to in in the future here. We also [music] want to remember brother Samuel Eggmana. He needs a touch from the Lord and uh we have an unspoken request tonight. If you have a need tonight, maybe just defy gravity and make it known unto him as we go to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we just thank you for this another opportunity, Lord, to gather together in your name. Father, we don't know how many more times we will have like this on this side of eternity. We know that any day anything could change. Father, you could decide that our time is complete here on earth and call us home. Father, we could see the loved ones that have gone on before us, and we could see a body change in in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, according to your word. We don't know what tomorrow has in store, but we know that you have it all in your control. It's all in your hand, Lord. And we thank you for that. In this world of uncertainty, Father, there's only one thing that is certain, and that's you. And father, we just ask that we could find ourselves to be found in you, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. There's no other place. There's no other hiding place in this world. &gt;&gt; Unto who could we go? &gt;&gt; And Father, tonight we just thank you for the praise report for Brother Peter Hoffer, that he would be able to go back home and be with his family, Lord, and to be able to communicate with them after the doctor said there's no hope. that clinically he's brain dead, but we know that the family believes that you are a living God. &gt;&gt; And Father, we give you all the praise and all the glory. &gt;&gt; We thank you tonight, Father. And Lord Jesus, tonight we just want to remember the unspoken request. Father, &gt;&gt; you know the circumstance and the situation and we trust you, Father, that you have it in your complete control. And we'll be careful to give you the praise, Lord, when the time comes that you answer it. Lord, &gt;&gt; and Father, we just want to remember brother Samuel Eggman is suffering from bleeding noses and the doctors don't know why. Father, we know that brother Jerry Carpenter [music] had the same thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just thank you, Lord, that you are the great physician &gt;&gt; and your specialty is when the doctors don't know. We just commit our brothers into your hands, Father. That you would just touch them in the name of Jesus. That they would come and give a praise report as well. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, we just ask that you would bless each one who's made the effort to come out, Lord, who's Lord, brought a request in their heart. Lord, we've come, we've gathered together in your name because we have needs in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that many times the needs are so complicated. There's no human there's no way humanly that we could ever see a way for it to be fixed. But Lord Jesus, we know that there's nothing too great for you. &gt;&gt; So we just commit each need into your hands now for your glory, Father. Each one that raised their hand tonight, Lord, we thank you for them. We thank you for their desire, Lord, to bring their needs unto you according to your word, which is your will. Now, we just ask, Father, that you would bless each one as we change the order of the service now and turn to your word. We [music] just ask that you would be glorified. We ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Musicians, thank you so much. Once again, if you have your Bibles, I'd like to continue on in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, speaking about spiritual gifts. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. I love how the Lord spoke to us through this word through the prophet Paul. Chapter 12 verse one. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Aren't you thankful for that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. &gt;&gt; And there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. That's so wonderful. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit. To another gifts of healing by the same Spirit. To another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one, and the self-samed spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit, we are all baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that you have given your spirit, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; You've given it freely, Lord, for all of us to profit with all. And we know that it's not for a financial gain, Lord. It's so that we could actually hear your word and receive it into our heart and get revelation from it. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; that's the prophet we're talking about. We thank you for that, Lord. And we pray that you would just, oh Lord Jesus, let the windows of heaven open again tonight, Lord, and just pour yourself out to us, Lord, so that we could, Lord, receive a blessing that we just can't even contain, Father, according to your word, Lord Jesus, we ask. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be seated. I uh had the pleasure of getting up early today and I do it pretty much every day, but just getting on the on the uh Bible study and just had some some thoughts I thought were were pretty interesting. You know, I just I went into the day today thinking about it. You know, when the time comes for us to be over there on the other side, I I believe we will have a consciousness of this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be conscious of our lives that we lived here. And uh and I just I just got thinking about this and you know I don't know if if I kind of doubt we will have like a photo album but we might have the the memories and and probably all of them because we'll be in a a perfect body at that point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we'll be able to recall all of the situations in our lives. And you know what really hit me this morning was that we're not going to actually have things there from here, are we? The only thing that we're going to have are the memories of the things that we actually did here. A and even more so, the only thing that we're going to have are the memories of the decisions that we made. I know I jumped the gun, brother. Thank you. Um, I've got announcements I'm going to get into, but I just wanted to bring this thought about how the only thing that we're really going to have over there to remember are the decisions that we made here and how vital and how important every single decision that we make here actually is because that's what's shaping our character and that's the only thing that we get to take with us. &gt;&gt; We don't get to take our investments. We don't get to take any of our insurance payments. We don't get to take our houses, our cars, any of our jewelry. There's nothing that we're going to take from this world &gt;&gt; except for the decisions that we make. And so when we zoom out and think about it, as we look back on our lives from that position, what will it be like to consider that one decision that we made from that time I decided to accept that William Mariam Brham was the infallible prophet to the age. And from that time, I accepted all that he said, whether I believed it or understood it or or any of it. I just accepted it and said amen to that word. &gt;&gt; And you know, I just I just about had a little jubilee. I would have woke everyone up if I started shouting. But just to think about that, what that means, because only the people that actually get to that place, that make that decision, are going to be the ones looking back saying, "Praise the Lord. I actually made that decision. That is what put me here. That's what caused me to go in the rapture. Anyone who chooses to hybridize the message of the hour with any one of their thoughts is actually not going to make it in the rapture. And I know that's a piercing thought. It's actually a searing word to hear to our lives. But, you know, we either believe or we don't. And and looking back, I just think it's going to be so wonderful to say it because if we're able to believe it, it's not something that we could just choose to do either. Just for the record, it's a gift that God has given us before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Chosen in him so that we would be able to receive it. I was on another call and I was I was talking about it and I just was was thinking, you know, a scenario might be like John the prophet, the the the the guy that was on the aisle of Patmas for the testimony of Jesus Christ. He actually maybe he was like the the the all-star quarterback and and he had the word for his age. And what did he do? He actually threw a long bomb down through eternity so that someone would be there in every single age to catch that word and then another quarterback would catch it and and then throw it further and it just would continue to go leaprogging down throughout the ages to this age. Brother Brham, taking that word, &gt;&gt; actually receiving that word, being like the wide receiver in the end zone, the end of time, being able to catch that word a and be able to actually bring it to the people and properly show it to them because we know the word only comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come to the seminary. &gt;&gt; It doesn't come to the theologians. Doesn't come to the pope. doesn't even come to the pastor. It comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And it's important to just make sure that the pastor is saying what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the critical factor. But I just was thinking about this. What a what a what a tremendous thing this will be. It it it this is that which will break make and bring to pass their victory. He says in the love divine charity, the Holy Ghost as we read about that's given to everyone to profit with all. I just thought about that today and it just just made me pretty excited. &gt;&gt; Just wanted to remind everyone we got the the regular prayer meeting first uh Thursday of the month. Tomorrow at 7:30 Saturday the 22nd we have Sister Germaine's funeral and uh it's going to be a busy day. We have her funeral on the 22nd at 10:00 a.m. There is the That's the funeral service. Then we have the burial. I believe it's at the same cemetery where the the funeral service will be held. That will be at 1:00 p.m. And there will be a reception at 2 p.m. And then we actually have service at 6:00 p.m. with Brother Cadre Diggs. And then uh we'll have service on the Sunday the next day. We have the youth event scheduled for Sunday the 23rd and we have a youth service for Friday the 28th and uh certainly excited to see what the Lord will do there again. We had a tremendous youth service on uh on Friday last week and just just really neat to see the Lord move in the the lives of the youth. Certainly excited to see what will happen there. you know, um, talking about our scripture tonight, I wanted to, uh, pick up from where we left off last week. We talked about the word of wisdom, uh, out of verse eight. For there is, for to one is given by the spirit, the word of wisdom, to another, the word of knowledge by the same spirit. So, we talked a little bit about wisdom last week, and I want to talk about knowledge this week. and uh by the grace of God, we'll maybe be able to just just talk about a little bit and see what the Lord will do. You know, uh wisdom and knowledge, as I'm sure we know, kind of go together. And I don't think it's an accident that they're both together in verse eight here because, you know, when you have wisdom, you can actually have knowledge. And uh they're not exactly the same. I'm not going to get into the the perfect definitions of them tonight. I'm going to look at it from more of a spiritual aspect, &gt;&gt; but I believe that uh there is a little bit of a a comparison that we can do that will actually maybe help explain it just a little bit. And you know, it's kind of according to the word of God. And and I believe that wisdom, the word of wisdom, it it speaks to revelation and understanding. When we have revelation in our lives about the word of God, we have a supernatural wisdom about the word of God. And it's not just knowledge. [clears throat] Just knowledge is actually reading and and maybe comprehending and having a conversation. But it takes the wisdom of the spirit to actually create a revelation that will take that word from our mind all the way down into our heart. Because as a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. &gt;&gt; And we know that hearts, how can a heart think? Brother Brandham talks about that. It's kind of a strange thing if you want to get scientific about it because hearts don't have brains, do they? They have souls. There's just a tiny little spot inside them. But wisdom, it speaks a little bit to revelation and understanding. And knowledge, I think, speaks to experience. I just wanted to bring it that way because when we have revelation and understanding, then we can take it and apply it in our lives. And when we do that, we actually demonstrate that we have experience. Now I I think it's a beautiful thing because when we look at the elders who actually are able to bring a good report of this word, what does the the wisdom in their lives do about this word? Does it give them an opportunity to have a solid word-based experience that they demonstrate to the brothers and sisters around them and their children and even the congregation? Does does it actually give them that or does something else take place? Because I want to say tonight if something else is taking place then I I'll I'll guarantee you it is not according to the word of God. It's not a word of wisdom according to the word of God that gives people head knowledge. head knowledge is simply coming and understanding and and I think it's a part a bit of a part of uh maybe having a bit of a religion a religious experience instead of actually having a relationship with the king of kings and lord of lords where he becomes lord and as we read in the scripture tonight nobody nobody no human being sorry about that no human being actually calls him lord without the holy ghost in their life &gt;&gt; and and I'll say this I think it's very important to say it you know people will say it people will say oh he's my lord he's my lord oh yes he's my lord but they won't live it &gt;&gt; so what it is is a p impersonation of Christianity &gt;&gt; and and and I got into this on the call this morning you know there's if you could just visualize maybe a wall a wall like this and and it's divided up into cubicles cubicles cubicles the whole wall is just different cubicles you could probably take a wall bigger than that and make a whole bunch of cubicles and each one would fit a different description of Christianity. What is Christianity? Christianity is being Christlike, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Christlike. And we know that Catholicism would probably trump everyone because they claim to be Christians. &gt;&gt; The Catholics do very much so. They claim to be the first Christians. In fact, that word Catholic means universal. So, they would cover all of the boxes, right? But which one of those boxes would would we be? Which one would we be? I I don't know where it would fit. The only one that would fit would actually be those who actually call him Lord. And the only way you can call him Lord is to live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the word's talking about. It's not saying I call him Lord. Lord, you're Lord of my life. And and and then I go and just live my life or I I just conduct myself in a way that's actually contrary to the word of God. It doesn't work. It creates a mixed signal. out of 1955 where I think Pentecost failed. Brother Brandham, he says, "And therefore, when people claim to be Christians or impersonate Christianity or try to act like they're a Christian, when down in their heart they don't have the peace of God, you only become an actor." Brothers and sisters, that's why I preach continually. We've got to have the Holy Ghost in our life. And I'm not saying that tonight we got to have the Holy Ghost so that we can see gifts in our lives. We've got to have the Holy Ghost in our lives so that we know we're sealed, so that we know exactly where we stand with the Lord. The Holy Ghost is going to be the one that leads us and guides us into all truth. And what's all truth? I'll say it this way. For our day, the cubicle would be the message of the hour, wherever that is on the wall. And outside of that cubicle on on on the wall with Christianity as a whole, that that cubicle with the message of the hour, outside of that, we're actually not calling him Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We desire to call him Lord. Many people claim Jesus. Many people claim the blood, but nobody is actually falling under the token for this age outside of this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's just the way it is. That's God's program. That's not our program. We never designed it that way. Some people think that William Brham created a cult and a whole bunch of people they came along and and got sucked into it and everybody follows a man. We know that we don't follow cunningly devised fables. &gt;&gt; We follow the word of God that was given and laid out by God through Paul &gt;&gt; and then passed down through all of the ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But some people, they just don't go all the way and get into Christ. And and the reason we're saying this is because it's true. Some people come all the way up to that promised land, the Jordan River, the time to die out to themselves and actually cross over into the promised land so that they can become adopted. But they just don't want to cross over. They're just pretty happy on this side of the land. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But they see all the blessings of the Lord in their lives. They can come to church and experience wonderful church services, the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost in other people's lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but maybe miss out on their own. Unless we actually go all the way into the promised land, we can't be positionally placed in the land. And just being over in the promised land does not mean we are positionally placed in the land because adoption is that final step of being positionally placed in our inheritance. &gt;&gt; And it takes wisdom and it takes knowledge. It takes revelation by the word, by the spirit to the word. It takes that revelation, that wisdom to give us knowledge on how to conduct ourselves to fight the enemy because he's not going to give an inch. We're going to have to fight for every single inch of land in our inheritance. That's what the prophet said. Let's go back to the quote here. And therefore, when people claim to be Christians or impersonate Christianity or try to act like they're a Christian when down in their heart they don't have the peace of God, you only become an actor. And you know, people really know that. People can see it. People are wise. Our our our our actions betray us. Your neighbor knows that you're just acting that way. Certainly. She see you just get mad and fly loose and beat the dog around the house and holler at your husband and scat him under the bed when he comes in and you do the same to wife. They know that's not Christianity &gt;&gt; acting. Certainly I say Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Now don't get me wrong we all have humanity. We all definitely have humanity. But brother Brandham says something here. When you really get saved, he changes you. &gt;&gt; So I want to say tonight, if we're still the same old man, if that same old man is still alive in our lives, have we died out? &gt;&gt; And and I'll say it this way because I know what it's like. The old man doesn't want to die. The old man is going to be around. You know, we have the thorn in our flesh. Our flesh is that thorn. We got to remember that. We're going to fight that guy. But is it easier or better now than it was before? Because it should be. Is it different now than it was before? Because it should be. If it's the same as it was before, then we've missed something. &gt;&gt; There's something missing. And tonight, I want to encourage us to find that missing thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't have to carry on acting. He said, "When you really get saved, he changes you. You don't have to act. You just act natural." &gt;&gt; The way you are here is the way you are there. &gt;&gt; When you're up, you're up. When you're down, you're down. You're still the same person. &gt;&gt; I just love that you're just yourself. &gt;&gt; But God forsaw and placed and set certain things to happen. Therefore, he could take the prophets with the gift of knowledge and foreshow them what was going to be. and they could speak it because it's a word of knowledge that God gives to his prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I was studying this, I thought, man, that's so good because I don't really think that I need to worry too much about having this this knowledge in the word of God here because he'll give me the knowledge that I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. If I am able to call him Lord by living my life according to that that that statement and and letting his spirit reveal to me the the deep things, yay, the hidden things, the mysterious things. If I am able to allow him to do that, then you know what? This this message of the hour is going to actually bring this whole thing to life for us. But it takes the Lord to do it. It takes his knowledge to do it for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, tonight we're talking about the the word of knowledge and uh how wisdom basically goes together with knowledge and and it's revelation and understanding uh wisdom and and knowledge I think speaks to experience. As I said, I could be wrong with that. Somebody might want to discuss it and and say that's not right. But that's okay. I'm open to discussion. I think there's nothing better to talk about, is there, than the word of God. But we're not supposed to come together and be contentious. You know, in Romans chapter 5, if you want to turn over there tonight, Romans chapter 5, got a few scriptures that will bring, Lord willing. Romans 5:1 says, "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace, wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation workketh patience. And we know that patience is part of the virtues, isn't it? In the stature of the perfect man. Unfortunately, it is. And patience experience and experience hope. and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. I just think this scripture is so good because it talks it speaks about how tribulations are what's going to bring forward this experience in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Talking about our scripture tonight, as I mentioned, the word of of knowledge is a bit about experience and and taking the wisdom through revelation that we've got about this word and being able to overcome in our everyday lives and being able to overcome in our marriages and to overcome with our families and maybe at work and maybe at school all of the situations that we have to go through. And it can be as simple as the revelation that, you know, that's that's that actually pertains to me. You know, maybe my spouse actually I'm not saying that my spouse does, but I'm just going to say it. For example, maybe my spouse just continually says nasty things to me. Continually says nasty things to me. Continually pounding on me. What does the word of God say? The Old Testament law says an eye for an eye, right? But we know that the word of God also says that a soft word turneth away wrath. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. If we just take the word of God and and take it and use it as a club to suit our needs, what's going to happen is we're not going to have the experience that we're talking about. It's going to be a a head knowledge full of of the word that we think we understand, even including the message of the hour. But it's not going to give us the overcoming power. And tonight I want to talk about how we can have wisdom of the word, the Lord's wisdom by the spirit in our lives that will give us the ability to pull the sword of the word and actually have knowledge on how to to to swing it, &gt;&gt; how to to to use that sword skillfully and and know that we can actually have success in our relationships. We can have success in in our our our marriages and and our our jobs, things that we encounter in this life. We don't have to just be slapped around by the devil. I think it's so beautiful because when we look at it, when we're getting tribulations, we glory in tribulations is what Paul says to the Romans. Knowing that tribulation workketh patience, it causes us to say, "Hold on a second. There's nothing that I can do in this situation except for look up." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And trust the Lord to work it out. &gt;&gt; And and what happens is it causes us to have patience in our lives and it stretches us to a place like maybe we thought we could never get to. But we know that he'll never give us anything more than we can bear. But once we get that patience, we have experience. We have knowledge on the Lord is actually looking after things. He's actually not just going to leave us or forsake us. He's going to take us through this trial. He's not going to take us around it and and allow us to avoid it. But he's going to take us through it and show us through patience that we have experience. And because of that experience, we're going to have a hope. I would say a supernatural hope because we know that he is in complete control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But verse 5 says, "And it hope maketh not ashamed doesn't make us ashamed to know that we've gone through things before in our life and he is able to take us through the situations." We're not ashamed of it. We're not ashamed of this gospel. We're not ashamed of this message. We're not ashamed of how we stand in the word of God, how we believe. We are not ashamed of it because the the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. So beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about the word of knowledge and how wisdom and knowledge go together. the revelation of the word by the spirit gives us knowledge and and we know that there's a gift of knowledge. It's it's it's a word maybe by the spirit of wisdom and there's another the word of knowledge. Sometimes we can have some insight into the word of God and and have a word of wisdom to say, well, maybe the scripture actually reads this way and we've read it our entire lives like this. But, you know, sometimes just even in a conversation, the Lord will come where he's invited and where there's just two people fellowshipping around the word or even in a service, we can catch a revelation about the word like we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is going to be that word of knowledge, bringing that word into our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Proverbs chapter 8, let's turn over to Proverbs chapter 8. Proverbs chapter 8. I think it's marvelous how Solomon, the wisest man, I think we talked a little bit about this last week. If we did, I apologize, but I just think it's so good because it speaks to both &gt;&gt; wisdom and knowledge. Proverb Proverbsapter 8:6 says here, "For I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things." Who is this speaking here? We know that this is Solomon, isn't it? It's the wisest man that ever lived. But there's an inspiration behind this word, isn't it? It's the Lord through Solomon creating this proverb here. For I will speak of excellent things, [snorts] and the opening of my lips shall be right things. And I just think it's so important to remember this is the Lord speaking here. It's not just Solomon. For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. It just makes me think, you know, we wouldn't it be wonderful if we could have this as our words coming out of our mouths. The wisdom and revelation of this word in our lives creating the knowledge for us to actually live in our lives. We can hear this word and understand that the word that we're hearing is the right thing. And and let my mouth speak truth for my mouth shall speak truth. Verse seven, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. I just don't want to hear it. I just don't want to say it. When the brother or the sister wants to start throwing off on someone, I just don't want to hear it. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, it's the best way to change a situation. Because when that happens, it's not actually people talking about people. It's devils trying to pass themselves off to other people in the congregation. It's a spiritual virus and it's nasty. When we start talking about one another, my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. I don't want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he even talks about stuff like that. Sometimes we just need to say, "Shut up about that. Shut your mouth." I'm a living witness of it. I tried doing it one time with a brother about another brother and I was a junior Christian at the time. But I I was in this state where I was just I I I was so full of knowledge without wisdom. You know how people get there in their their their immature state of being a Christian walking this walk. We get there. It happens. It's part of the stages. We all have to go through it. The only problem is some people stay stuck there and and I think we talked about a little bit on Sunday where they're just smarter than everyone and and people just don't want to be around them because they could just you can't even relate to them. But anyways, I was in that state and I started throwing off about a brother and the brother that I was doing it with, he told me to shut up. He said, "I don't want to hear it. I don't want nothing to do with it." And I was like, "Oh." I felt embarrassed. And guess what happened is it shut me down. But what it did was it killed that devil. &gt;&gt; That's knowledge. That's knowledge by wisdom. I would say a word of knowledge. It's so beautiful, too, isn't it? Because we're not wrestling against flesh and blood, brothers and sisters. We're not fighting one another. We're not fighting against man. Once upon a time, it was like that to get into our inheritance. We're fighting devils, &gt;&gt; principalities, and powers. And the devils travel in words. And and if we've got something other than truth coming out of our mouths, it's wickedness. Verse eight says, "All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing forward or perverse in them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. So beautiful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The right words, the truth, the understanding that we want, that we need, that we require for this knowledge to work the way that we want it to, for the gift of the spirit to work in our lives, it has to be centered around truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to be centered around truth. And the truth that we're talking about is truly the Lord, the Holy Ghost in our lives. Verse 10 says, "Receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold." Don't get so caught up in this world that all of our investments cause us to actually not be able to participate following the word of God. If anything in our life keeps us from following the word of God, we've got an idol. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Anything that would take us and cause us to not be able to be obedient to God's word, which is his will, is an idol. And I'm saying that because I say, "Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me." There's so many things in this world now that can take us and just distract us. That's all the devil needs to do is just distract us. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to take us and push us over the cliff or or take us out to the clubs or get us sitting that way. He just needs to distract us. As long as we're distracted, we're not re realizing who we are. and he gains another day. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing, but we know that his time is running short, so he's working overtime and his guns are trained only on the bride. I remember my pastor, Brother Ken Ber, preaching that and saying that, and I couldn't understand that, but I could see it so clearly now. The whole entire world is already under the sway of the beast system. There's just no getting away from that. If you ever go into the ocean and you snorkel, you can see that everything in the water, it just goes with the sway of the current. It cannot resist the current. And it's the same thing in this world spiritually speaking. This whole entire world as we've witnessed, we've all been witnesses to it. The COVID pandemic was uh was it a plemic, a pandemic? Was there, you know, a virus or or the vaccination, vaccines, whatever about all of that. I will say this though, it was a test of the beast system. &gt;&gt; The beast system has proved it has full control of the entire world within 24 hours. Who cares about all the rest of it? If it's a virus, go ahead, give it to me. If it's a vaccine, go ahead, give it to me. Mark 16 in action is the only true church. All else is false. It's not going to stop us. But this word of truth says, "Receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold." Don't don't forfeit our rights to spiritual wisdom and spiritual knowledge to the things of this world. Don't do that. Verse 11 says, "For wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared with it." Then it goes into making it personal. I I think it's just so beautiful. I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogancy. Both of those two things, if we have those as a Christian, then we're still kind of missing the mark. I think we still probably have a little ways to go. And we all have a ways to go. There's no way that we can actually escape that. But the fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth. Who's talking here? Solomon. We already mentioned that someone else is talking. Solomon is a scribe. &gt;&gt; He had a wisdom that came from somewhere, didn't he? We talked about that last week. He had knowledge that came from somewhere. And and this is not Solomon saying this. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Pride, arrogancy, and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate. Counsel is mine and sound wisdom. Now I I just love this part because he's not saying I have understanding and I have strength. What does he say? I am understanding. I have strength. &gt;&gt; I thought tonight I would just take a moment and bring this out of the Amplified Bible. Just just for the effect of it, I think it's so good. In in Proverbs 8 verse 6, it says, "Here, for I will speak excellent and princely things, and the opening of my lips shall be for right things. My mouth shall utter truth and wrongdoing is detestable and loathsome to my lips. All the Did you ever Did you ever have to go on your knees and ask the Lord to forgive you for something that you've done and and it's just almost even difficult to mention it to the Lord. It's because of the word. It's it's detestable and it's loathsome to our lips as believers. It's hard to say. Verse eight, all the words of my mouth are righteous, upright, and in right standing with God. There is nothing contrary to truth or crooked in them. I believe that truly is the position of a believer. someone who really believes this message of the hour. Someone who truly can call Jesus Lord. Excuse me. It's because it's by the Holy Ghost. Right? In verse 9, they are all plain to him who understands and opens his heart and right to those who find knowledge. I love this part. And live by it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just talk about it. It's got to be lived, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our lives need to demonstrate this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Our lives need to be more than just perhaps something that we do or or say. It's it's got to be actually the life that we live. Receive my instruction in preference to striving for silver and knowledge rather than choice gold. For skillful and godly wisdom is better than rubies or pearls and all the things that may be desired are not to be care compared to it. I wisdom from God says it plainly here make prudence my dwelling. &gt;&gt; Prudence our desire to actually go and serve the Lord with all of our heart, our mind and our soul and consistently doing it. It's one thing to be so on fire for God and have all the revelation, but it's a totally different thing to realize that we're in a marathon race. &gt;&gt; It's not a speed across a speed race to get across the finish line. It's about getting across the finish line. And and being able to do all of the little things in a prudent fashion is uh it's not easy. But I wisdom from God make prudence my dwelling and I find out knowledge and discretion. The reverent fear and worship, worshipful awe of the Lord includes the hatred of evil, pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted and twisted speech. I hate I think it's amazing because you know we ought to be able to have the exact same speech here with brothers and sisters that we have at home or that we have in the car &gt;&gt; or that we have at work or that we have at school. We ought to be having the exact same speech. We ought to be speaking the same words, speaking the same way, having the same behaviors, not acting differently just because we're in a certain position or a certain place. And I speak from experience because I know that I have gone down that road as a message believer. I'm not just talking about being out in the world. I'm talking about being saved, sanctified, justified, and and filled with the Holy Ghost, but just maybe not as prudent as I ought to be, which causes the ability for these things to creep in our lives. But you know, he says here, "The reverent fear and worshipful awe of the Lord includes the hatred of evil, pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted and twisted speech." I I think it's important to just recognize that this scripture here, this verse, it actually speaks to the life of a believer. This is this this would be like I would be saying this the reverent fear and worshipful awe of the Lord my worshipful fear and awe of the Lord would include the hatred of evil. Is is that our desire? Is that the way that we would be able to say that tonight? That that we hate evil, we hate pride. We hate arrogance the evil way and perverted and twisted speech. I hate Do you hate that tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 14 says, "I have counsel and sound knowledge. I have understanding. I have might and power." I just wanted to go back to uh this book here. And uh unfortunately the print is just a little bit too small now. So I've got to do that. But you know, brother Bradom, he gets asked this question and I think it's important as we read about the the spiritual gifts that happen in the church that should be happening in the church. By the way, brother Bradam said it that um you know every church, every praying assembly ought to see these gifts happening in the church. But this this question came up. It's uh out of questions and answers. He says, "Does he at all times have control over the spirit as to when and how to act?" I think it's just an interesting question all around because does he have control over the spirit? It sounds like a different person or a different being. Does he have control over the spirit? The spirit is he. &gt;&gt; He is the spirit, right? &gt;&gt; We understand that. But he says, "Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The Holy Spirit controls." Yes, sir. It has control of you and you have control of it and it'll never make you do anything contrary to the scripture. It'll make the spirit does not misbehave itself unseemingly. That's right. Okay. I think that's uh just such a beautiful thing. We don't have to worry about spiritual gifts. And and I think probably this would be the overarching thought that I felt led to get into when we talk about spiritual gifts is we don't have to be afraid of them. I would think that we have to be afraid that we don't see them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not because we want to put gifts ahead of anything, but the prophet said that any good praying church ought to see all of those gifts manifesting. And they are part of the church. So I'm not saying where are they because I know they're here. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're here. Every single one of them. We have no worries. There's no fear at all. I have another quote that I wanted to bring. What visions are in in talking about this gift in particular of the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom. They kind of go hand in hand. The way Solomon talked about them. I could have brought a lot of scriptures out of Proverbs. I will leave that to you if you desire to to read them and and just see what the Lord would reveal to you by his wisdom. And uh you'll see what I mean. I'm sure you understand that there's a lot in Proverbs, but out of what visions are in 1956, but a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee or foresee something tells something that has been or something that will be. Now before the other quote we read, brother Brandham talked about it being something that God gives to the prophet. So there's many different the point that I want to get to here a little bit of it anyways is there's many different ways for this to actually manifest. And I I think it's so amazingly beautiful. We talked about it last week. I believe that it's not hard and fast that it has to be exactly this way every single time or it's actually false. That is true when we get into tongues and interpretations and prophecy and we're going to get into those. There is a very specific way that it's supposed to be done. And Paul set that church in order and brother Bannam came and amplified that in the age in which we live. But for these two specific gifts, the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, there's many different ways they can manifest. Yeah. And I think it's just so beautiful because it's the Lord. How are we ever going to take him and put him in a box? &gt;&gt; Right. I love how he says it in this word that it's given by the spirit, the word of wisdom and to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; And it's not another spirit. It's Jesus Christ, the one that we call Lord. It's the Holy Ghost. But what visions are, brother Brown says, a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee or forth see something. Tells something that has been or something that will be. Now remember, we talked about this as well. When we get the people that are they're spiritual and they see things and they have visions and dreams and all these things, remember brother Brandham said dreams are secondary. They have to come to pass exactly the way we dream them in order for them to actually be something that we want to pay attention to. But when we have these things that happen, there's people that are spiritual and they act out gifts in their lives, but they miss one here and they miss one there. They're not actually firing every single time when it actually happens. And you know what that is? That's actually incorrect. The word of God says that if it happens every single time according to the way they bring it, then hear that man. But if it doesn't happen exactly every single time, they're a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word says to not hear that man. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say or woman. I've heard of lots of female prophetesses in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And I mean, anyways, either it's right or it's wrong. If it's not right every time, it's wrong &gt;&gt; all the time. But, you know, there is one that's not wrong, and I'm getting back into it again, and I don't want to yet, but it is just so we know that that I'm not trying to throw off on anything, but there is a very specific way to know. If God is going to show someone somewhere along the way, we're going to get into this very specifically later, but if God is going to show someone, don't drive home tonight, brother Peter, don't drive home Stony Trail tonight. Go the other way. Take another road. maybe go up down up to 52nd Street and drive all the way up 52nd Street all the way up to your house because there's going to be a terrible accident with a car that's your color. It will come to the church. It will already be tested by two or three witnesses and it will actually happen exactly the way that it's said. That's a prophecy that would come forward, but it would have to be done properly according to the church. &gt;&gt; And if it's true, it will actually come exactly the way it's said. But that's what I'm saying. There's a very specific way that's laid out in the word that's actually brought by Paul that's ma magnified by William Bratam about the way prophecies and speaking in tongues should happen. But here we are. We're talking about the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge. Jumping ahead of myself, but a vision is of God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee to foresee something. Tell something that has been or something that will be. Now I'm going to make it real simple. I just love that we got little brighteyed children sitting here and if Jesus terries that's the men and women of tomorrow and that applies tonight. I think that too many times that we make the gospel so complicated and I'll say it this way so deep sometimes we just want the deep things. the deep things. We want the mysterious things. Remember, there's no more mystery. &gt;&gt; The deep things are already explained. &gt;&gt; But we have make the gospel so complicated that just maybe the adults and so forth could understand it and don't realize that those little children get it also. Kids are pretty smart. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say there's a circus in town. Now, first thing I want to say that all gifts and callings are without repentance. The scripture says that who talking through can add one cubit to his stature. You are because God has made you. He says this here. Some time ago a woman came to a meeting. She was at home. Something struck her. She had arthritis. She was drawn up. Something struck her that the Lord was going to heal her. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes that happens to us. Something struck her that the Lord was going to heal her. She knew it positive. She wasn't guessing at it. She knew it was so. So when she got a cab and stepped out of the stretcher into the cab, can you imagine? She stepped out of a stretcher, got up off a stretcher to get into a cab, brought her to the place while in the meeting that night, not even prayed for, but when she seen the spirit of God working, moving, she said, "That's it, Lord Jesus. That's what I've looked forward to." &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember, brothers and sisters, say the right things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying the wrong things we just heard about. He hates it when we say the wrong things. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; I ain't claiming to be an angel. &gt;&gt; I am a sinner saved by grace." And many times my mouth gets away on me. My my speech betrays me. But, you know, I know that I'm a son of God and I will always come back to center. I will always try and make it right. But say the right thing. That's what we need to do. had right said the right thing. Remember, &gt;&gt; I'm just going to emphasize that a little bit tonight. Remind us about that. They were just sitting around eating something. They were eating I'm not going to say it tonight. They were eating something. They were drinking coffee and and while they were there doing that, they were just fellowshipping around the table. How many of us just fellowship around the table with a couple or three believers and we just talk about the things of the Lord? And do we just talk about the things that God's done for us specifically? Can we put our finger on when God came by and he did this for me? And it sounds crazy. Sometimes the things that the Lord does for us is truly a paradox, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable, but yet it's exactly true. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it, but it's 100% real. How did my bank account change? How did that bill get paid? How did I get that job? How did I get those grades? How did I find that spouse? I'm sure that every one of us could say that. How did I find that spouse? It's the grace of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we can talk about these things and as we talk about these things, I just think it's so beautiful because it's exactly what happened with brother Brandham. We say the right thing. God appreciates that, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; And God through his prophet told that woman, I appreciate that. I am happy to hear you said the right thing. You made me happy. So, I'm going to make you happy and I'm going to tell you, ask what you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Specifically, you want a million dollars. You need money. You're poor. Do you want your sister that we've prayed for many times? Now, this is the prophet of God who had the prayer prayer lines, the the healing ministry. We prayed for her already, but she's still not healed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; She requested the one thing of eternal value. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She said the right thing, &gt;&gt; right? So I want to say tonight, are we saying the right thing? &gt;&gt; If we want to see this word of wisdom and the word of knowledge in our lives, if we want to see these gifts manifest, you know, don't even put it in the body. Take it out of the body because I'm not promoting it in the body even though I've said it that way. What about our lives? To have the revelation by the spirit to know how to use the word of God, to have the knowledge on how to stand against the ws of the enemy. But this woman, she stepped out of their stretcher into the cab and and brought her to the place while in the meeting that night, not even prayed for, but when God seen see when but when she seen the spirit of God working, moving, she said, "That's it, Lord Jesus. That's what I've looked forward to. Thank you." And when she got out of the cab, she never even got prayed for. When she got out got out of the cab, the cab said, "Madam, should I come back after the service and pick you up?" Said, "I won't need you. I'm going to walk home. &gt;&gt; God revealed it to her. &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think a word of wisdom dropped into her heart. &gt;&gt; A revelation dropped into her heart and it gave her knowledge how to deal with the situation. She had faith that came from somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's next level faith. That's God's own faith living out through us, isn't it? I'm not going to need you. I'm just going to walk home. But she had to crawl off a stretcher to get into the cab. And while the service was going on, the Lord straightened those crippled legs and she got right up and walked home. &gt;&gt; Of course, it was noised abroad. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And another woman said, "You know, I'm going to do the same thing." She takes a cab and goes up, tells the cab to leave, but the cab had to come back and get her. She was trying to mimic somebody else's faith. &gt;&gt; And you can't do that. And I just want to encourage us tonight, brothers and sisters, let's not try and mimic anybody else's faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. Let's try and surrender ourselves to the Lord maybe in a way like we never have before so that we can have that revelation by the word by the spirit that revelation of the spirit for the word of God to give us knowledge in how to use it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not looking at other people's experiences even though it's good to talk about but it's all an individual experience. God deals with Israel as a nation &gt;&gt; but he deals with the Gentiles as individuals. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you know, this jumped out at me this morning, too, when I was on the line. Oh, they just they asked me to take this the the the lesson today. It was spur of the moment. And I said, "All right, let's go. I'll be in in season, out of season." But, you know, God created us in his own image. We know that. We say it many times. We hear it lots of times. God created us in his own image. But one of the things that I think that really jumped out for me this morning was that he created us in his image to be a free moral agent. He gave us the ability to choose &gt;&gt; and and our choice as sons and daughters of God will always choose the word of God. &gt;&gt; We will always choose the correct thing. &gt;&gt; One day I'm going to get into preaching on being predestined and fornowledge and all of that. But you know, just in a a quick summary in in a couple minutes before we close here to know that we actually are a free moral agent, God predestinated us to the adoption of sons, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He didn't force us down a pipe &gt;&gt; to go to adoption. No, no. He created us in his own image so that we would choose the right thing. And because we're able to choose the right thing, then we're able to be placed as a son. &gt;&gt; But it's nothing that we could do. It's everything that he has done. &gt;&gt; He just knew what we would choose. &gt;&gt; But this woman here, he talks about it. He says she was trying to mimic somebody else's faith. I say, "Lord, don't let us mimic anybody else's faith." &gt;&gt; He says, "You can't do that. The devil knows better than that. You can't fool him. You've got to have what you profess you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. And that goes back to our first discussion. When the time comes for us to look back on our lives, I think we're going to be able to start flipping pages in our lives. And some of us are going to be able to say, "My book is just full of amazing decisions. I just made good decision after good decision. My good decision, good chapter, good decision." And all of those are just fantastic decisions and I just I'm so thankful. And some of us are going to be like, you know, I just want to skip past that first half of the book. I'm just going to skip past that. I don't want to look at that at all. But, you know, from from that chapter right there, from that place right there, man, the decisions changed entirely. I just started to make decisions that were just out of this world. And that's why I'm here. I can say that I made it because somehow I was able to make the right decisions. I just was thinking about that today. It just maybe it's a little bit weird. I'll call the musicians. But you know, that's all we're going to do is be able to look back and say that. And you know, there's coming a time where all of that's going to be in the past. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be looking back at this world because we know there's coming a time where he's going to wipe away all of our tears. &gt;&gt; And they're not going to be all tears of sadness. They're going to be tears of joy. He's going to give us a thousand years to get all of the hallelujah and praise the Lords. And I'm so glad you made it, brother Dawn. Oh my. Brother Aiden, I was so happy when I saw you the first time on the other side. Brother Peter, we did it. We everything that we fought for, we've made it. We're going to have a thousand years to get all of those out of the way. And then there's going to be a new Jerusalem that comes down. And behold, all things are going to become new in our lives. But you know, while we're here, brothers and sisters, there is a word of wisdom for us. &gt;&gt; And there is a word of knowledge as well. &gt;&gt; And I believe they're given to us to profit us with all our entire lives to give us the ability to know how to live in the world that we live in. God bless you tonight. Maybe stand with me as we close. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord, that we know that, Father, there's an everlasting gospel &gt;&gt; and that's what we preach, Lord. That's what we love, this everlasting gospel. And we know that there's coming a time where it will actually not be used anymore because we know that everlasting is a space of time. And Father, we're so thankful that you have called us to be your sons, to be your daughters. Father, we pray that Lord, we could just consecrate ourselves unto you greater. &gt;&gt; Father, every one of us, I know we need to just make sure that we check up on a regular basis. Father, I pray that you would just make yourself so real to each and every one of us, Father. That Lord, you would just be able to fill us so full with your spirit, Lord Jesus, that all of these things that we read about tonight would just have no more place in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; That Lord, we would run every single thought into captivity as you have instructed through your word. That we would recognize that Lord, even though the great ships they can go, wherever the captain lists by that by that rudder on the back of it. Oh, but Father, many times we can't even control our tongues. Father, I pray that you would just by your spirit give us revelation, Father. Give us a word of wisdom, Father, that would Lord Jesus, give us knowledge on how to take those thoughts into captivity and not give place to the devil any longer, Father, that your spirit would be able to live out through us in a greater way than ever before. &gt;&gt; Father, that's I I believe that's the desire of every one of your children is to see a greater manifestation of you in our lives. &gt;&gt; Myself included, Lord. We all need you, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight if anybody needs something special from you, Father, maybe before we leave this service, I pray that Lord, you would grant it to them in a special way, Father. Maybe somebody doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection. Maybe somebody doesn't know you, Father. Lord, according to the baptism of your Holy Spirit, Father, maybe some of us have grown cold, Lord. our experience has has cool cooled off, Lord, and we just need a little bit of a a top up of your spirit in our lives, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We know that you're more than able to meet every one of those. &gt;&gt; Father, let us not leave this building the same way that we came in. &gt;&gt; And Father, if it be your will for us to gather again on Sunday, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would be with all those who couldn't be here tonight. Father, wherever they are, whatever they're doing, Father, bless them abundantly, Father, strengthen them and encourage them, Lord, that Father, maybe we'll be able to see them again soon. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing 117? Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.
