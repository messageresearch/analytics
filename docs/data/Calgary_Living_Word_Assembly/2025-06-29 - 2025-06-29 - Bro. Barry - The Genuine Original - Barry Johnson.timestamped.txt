[56:40] Lord, I want to rest here and feel
[56:45] heaven smile.
[56:48] I want to be merry for a while.
[56:53] [Music]
[57:05] I know that I'll make mother proud of
[57:09] me.
[57:12] With lots to do and places I must be.
[57:18] [Music]
[57:20] And yet I need this time to refresh my
[57:24] heart and mind.
[57:27] Your presence, Lord, is just what I
[57:30] need.
[57:31] [Music]
[57:34] For I know I could be Martha all day
[57:41] and let my chance to be with you.
[57:45] Slip away.
[57:49] I want to be married for a while
[57:54] in all that I do. Close
[57:58] the door to everything that keeps my
[58:02] heart from you,
[58:05] Lord. I want to rest here and feel
[58:09] heaven smile.
[58:12] I want to be merry for a while.
[58:18] Draw me nearer.
[58:22] Draw me nearer. Precious Lord, draw me
[58:26] nearer
[58:29] to your side.
[58:32] Draw me nearer.
[58:36] Draw me nearer. Bless the Lord. Draw me
[58:40] nearer
[58:43] to your side.
[58:47] Lord, I want to rest here and feel
[58:51] heaven smile.
[58:57] I want to be married
[59:00] for a while.
[59:02] [Music]
[59:05] I want to be married
[59:10] for a while.
[59:12] [Music]
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:27] Why don't we give them all another hand
[59:29] clap? Amen.
[59:38] I know I already said it, but isn't it
[59:39] good to be in the house of the Lord? Our
[59:42] God is so good. The last song please
[59:44] Gabe.
[59:45] Amen. We have a maker and he knows our
[59:49] name.
[59:53] I have a maker
[1:00:00] before
[1:00:02] my heart. Please share with me.
[1:00:10] I began
[1:00:13] my life was

[1:00:29] He knows my
[1:00:33] heart.

[1:00:46] I have a father.
[1:00:50] I have a father.
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:01:00] Oh,
[1:01:02] he'll never
[1:01:04] he'll never
[1:01:07] leave.
[1:01:10] No matter where I go. Amen.
[1:01:18] He knows my name.
[1:01:25] He knows my name. As Mother Mary comes
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:42] I have a maker.
[1:01:46] I have a

[1:02:53] the creator of the heavens.
[1:02:56] He'll never
[1:02:59] There's nowhere we can go.
[1:03:02] No matter where I go,
[1:03:10] he knows my name.
[1:03:17] He knows my every cross.
[1:03:25] He sees me
[1:03:28] that falls
[1:03:30] and he hears me when I call.
[1:03:36] Amen. God bless you today. Welcome to
[1:03:39] the house of the Lord. One more time.
[1:03:41] We're certainly honored and truly
[1:03:44] privileged to be able to gather together
[1:03:47] in the name above every name.
[1:03:50] The name that makes demons tremble.
[1:03:54] If you have a need this morning, maybe
[1:03:56] just make it known unto him, the person
[1:03:59] of Jesus Christ this morning as we go to
[1:04:01] him in prayer. We just like to remember
[1:04:04] Sister Claudia Rencon
[1:04:06] from Edmonton. She uh has requested
[1:04:09] prayer for her family. She's
[1:04:12] encountering real difficulties trying to
[1:04:15] serve the Lord herself and her family
[1:04:18] challenging her on that.
[1:04:20] So, let's just go to him in prayer.
[1:04:23] Gracious heavenly father, we truly count
[1:04:25] it a privilege, Lord, to gather together
[1:04:28] in your presence.
[1:04:30] We don't take it lightly, Lord, to
[1:04:31] recognize whose presence we are in. And
[1:04:36] this morning, Father, we just invite
[1:04:37] you, Lord, to have the preeminence that
[1:04:39] you desire in this service, Lord. And
[1:04:41] not just in this service as a as a duty,
[1:04:44] Lord, as a a tradition, but Father,
[1:04:47] Lord, in our service unto you with our
[1:04:50] worship, Lord. Father, we're so thankful
[1:04:53] that we can gather together in your
[1:04:54] name. There's so many people in this
[1:04:57] world who are persecuted heavily for
[1:05:00] doing so and we can do it freely, Lord.
[1:05:03] Thank you for that privilege, Lord
[1:05:05] Jesus. Father, this morning we just want
[1:05:07] to remember the sister that we have
[1:05:10] already spoken, Lord, Sister Claudia
[1:05:12] Rencon in Edmonton, Lord. Father, we
[1:05:15] know that you are more than able. We
[1:05:18] have heard countless testimonies, Lord
[1:05:20] Jesus, on how one person in in a family
[1:05:24] unit can actually bring the entire
[1:05:26] family to your feet, Lord Jesus. And
[1:05:30] Father, we pray that this morning we
[1:05:31] could unite together with our sister,
[1:05:33] Lord. And that Lord Jesus, we would hear
[1:05:36] the testimony, the praise report,
[1:05:38] Father, about how you have restored that
[1:05:41] family, Lord Jesus. We know that there's
[1:05:44] only one thing of eternal value, Lord,
[1:05:46] and that is your word. And that is your
[1:05:48] word in the hearts of your children.
[1:05:50] Amen. And many many times people have
[1:05:52] requested things in their lives. But we
[1:05:54] know that James spoke about it and how
[1:05:57] they've asked a miss because they've
[1:05:59] asked according to the lust of their
[1:06:02] flesh and the lust of their minds in
[1:06:04] their hearts, Lord. But Father, there's
[1:06:06] only one thing of eternal value and that
[1:06:08] is for the Lord Jesus the redemption of
[1:06:10] the souls of our children and our
[1:06:12] families, Father. And Lord, I pray that
[1:06:15] our sister could apply the token,
[1:06:17] Father, and we could stand united with
[1:06:19] her, Father, for her family. That Lord,
[1:06:21] she would bring a testimony of praise.
[1:06:24] Father, this morning, we love you and we
[1:06:26] thank you and we just want to remember
[1:06:27] each need that was made known unto you
[1:06:29] today by the way of an uplift hand. And
[1:06:32] Father, we just ask that you would meet
[1:06:34] those needs sovereignly according to
[1:06:36] your will, which is your good pleasure,
[1:06:39] Father, your word. Now as we turn to
[1:06:42] you, Father, which is your word, we just
[1:06:44] ask, Lord, we invite you,
[1:06:47] have the preeminence, Lord, speak to our
[1:06:49] hearts, Lord Jesus. Let us not leave
[1:06:52] this building the same way that we came
[1:06:54] in. Father, we know that some people
[1:06:55] will say that alls they heard was the
[1:06:57] preacher calling them a crow, and others
[1:07:00] will say, "Alls I heard was that I'm an
[1:07:02] eagle." And Father, it's not up to us to
[1:07:04] discern that. It's only up to you. And
[1:07:06] we just commit that into your hands,
[1:07:08] Father, for your glory.
[1:07:11] We just ask all these things now in
[1:07:12] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:16] Thank you musicians. Thank you each one
[1:07:19] for the specials today. What a what a
[1:07:22] glorious thing it is. If you have your
[1:07:25] Bibles this morning, I'd like to read a
[1:07:27] few scriptures, but I would just like to
[1:07:29] start in Romans chapter 8.
[1:07:32] Romans chapter 8.
[1:07:36] While you're turning there, I just would
[1:07:37] like to quickly thank all those who have
[1:07:41] brought forth questions and put them in
[1:07:44] the uh the offering box at the back
[1:07:46] there. They certainly have been received
[1:07:50] and I love the idea of bringing out the
[1:07:54] answers for the questions. So, you know,
[1:07:57] brother Brandham says it very clearly
[1:07:58] that if we have questions, then we know
[1:08:01] what is in the heart of the children. We
[1:08:03] know what the people's minds are and and
[1:08:07] God can minister to us when we bring
[1:08:10] forth a question. And if it's a
[1:08:12] spiritual question, I guarantee you,
[1:08:13] brothers and sisters, there is a
[1:08:15] spiritual answer. Amen. Or there
[1:08:17] wouldn't be a spiritual question. It's a
[1:08:19] beautiful thing. But we know that uh the
[1:08:21] Lord is more than able. I I myself can't
[1:08:24] do it on my own, but we just give the
[1:08:26] Lord the glory. This morning, I'd like
[1:08:29] to read from Romans chapter 8, starting
[1:08:31] at verse 22.
[1:08:35] This is a scripture that we're
[1:08:36] witnessing in the day in which we live.
[1:08:39] For we know that the whole creation
[1:08:41] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[1:08:46] until now.
[1:08:48] And not only they, but ourselves also,
[1:08:53] which have the first fruits of the
[1:08:55] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[1:08:59] ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to
[1:09:01] it, the redemption of our body.
[1:09:06] For we are saved by hope, but hope that
[1:09:09] is seen is not hope.
[1:09:13] For what a man seeth, why do he yet hope
[1:09:16] for?
[1:09:18] But if we hope for that we see not,
[1:09:22] then do we with patience wait for it.
[1:09:27] Likewise the spirit
[1:09:30] also helpeth our infirmities.
[1:09:34] For we know not what we should pray for
[1:09:37] as we ought, but the Spirit itself
[1:09:42] maketh intercession for us with
[1:09:44] groanings which cannot be uttered.
[1:09:48] And he that searchth the hearts
[1:09:51] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:09:55] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:09:57] saints according to the will of God.
[1:10:03] And we know that all things work
[1:10:05] together for good to them that love God.
[1:10:09] To them who are the called according to
[1:10:14] his purpose.
[1:10:16] God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:10:19] seated.
[1:10:21] I certainly would like to thank everyone
[1:10:24] for coming out on a another Sunday. It's
[1:10:28] just a wonderful thing to be here again
[1:10:31] in the presence of one another
[1:10:34] and more than that to be in the presence
[1:10:37] of the Lord.
[1:10:39] Bear with me for one second here.
[1:10:43] Excuse me. Just like to welcome the
[1:10:45] visitors, Brother George and Sister Hope
[1:10:48] and the children from Cloverdale Bible
[1:10:49] Way. Trust you feel right at home here
[1:10:52] today.
[1:10:56] certainly
[1:10:58] thankful to have our friends the
[1:11:00] Clawson's here and not the Clawson from
[1:11:02] Saskatoon but the Clawson's from High
[1:11:05] River and the USA. God bless you today.
[1:11:12] Currently also residing at Cloverdale
[1:11:14] Bible Way and uh Sister Vera and Sister
[1:11:19] Haley Wheeler. God bless you today.
[1:11:25] And I know that there's some that we
[1:11:28] don't know the names of and we just
[1:11:29] certainly would like to welcome you in
[1:11:31] our midst as well. We trust that
[1:11:33] something will be said of eternal value
[1:11:35] for you. Today we have a praise report
[1:11:38] that we wanted to bring and that is uh
[1:11:41] for a sister summer creepon. I hope I've
[1:11:44] said that correctly. That was a sister
[1:11:46] that young sister that we prayed for who
[1:11:49] felt that she didn't want to serve the
[1:11:51] Lord anymore.
[1:11:53] And uh she's back in service today
[1:11:57] at her church. Amen.
[1:12:04] She has the testimony that she now has a
[1:12:07] joy she never knew before. Amen. And you
[1:12:11] know, we certainly can give the Lord a
[1:12:13] clap for that because I think that's
[1:12:15] tremendous
[1:12:21] because the will of God says
[1:12:24] our strength comes from his joy.
[1:12:28] And that's where it comes from. We can
[1:12:30] have all of the spiritual strength that
[1:12:32] we can muster up on our own and be
[1:12:36] miserable,
[1:12:37] but you know, we're only going to be as
[1:12:40] strong as our knowledge to and adherence
[1:12:43] of the word of God. So when we know that
[1:12:46] our strength is from the Lord, the Lord
[1:12:50] is our strength, then uh the joy of the
[1:12:53] Lord brings even more strength to us.
[1:12:56] It's just a wonderful thing to know his
[1:12:58] word.
[1:12:59] But we certainly want to continue to
[1:13:01] pray for Sister Summer Creepon because
[1:13:03] we don't want to live on emotion. We can
[1:13:05] very easily get caught up on emotion and
[1:13:07] believe that an emotion is actually
[1:13:09] going to be the experience that we've
[1:13:11] been waiting for. And we know that a lot
[1:13:13] of denominational teachings will bring
[1:13:14] that to say that, you know, if you speak
[1:13:16] in tongues, if you dance in the spirit,
[1:13:18] if you shout, if you cry, if you go
[1:13:21] through all these different things, then
[1:13:22] you truly must have the spirit of God.
[1:13:24] And and that can be true. But that is
[1:13:26] not the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:13:28] Ghost. Our only evidence was given to us
[1:13:31] by a vindicated prophet in the age in
[1:13:33] which we live. And we all know what that
[1:13:35] is. And if we don't know what it is, I'm
[1:13:37] just going to say it. And it's quite
[1:13:38] simple. It's that we have the ability to
[1:13:41] stay with the word of God. We have the
[1:13:43] ability to say amen to the word of God.
[1:13:46] We're not willing to try and make
[1:13:47] excuses for it to say that well, the
[1:13:49] word of God was for another age, it was
[1:13:51] for another time, it was a cultural
[1:13:53] difference. You know, if God sent a
[1:13:56] prophet, he would give that prophet the
[1:13:58] word that the people would need for the
[1:14:01] day in which we live.
[1:14:03] But somewhere along the way, somehow it
[1:14:06] just became convenient to try and push
[1:14:08] it aside and say, "Well, that prophet,
[1:14:10] he just went off on his do." And we
[1:14:11] know, we know that happened in in the
[1:14:14] book of Jeremiah very clearly. That
[1:14:17] prophet was given a word of God and he
[1:14:19] gave it to the most religious people of
[1:14:22] the day because that's who God told him
[1:14:24] to bring it to. And what did they do?
[1:14:26] They just shunned him. They said he's
[1:14:28] he's gone off his rocker. He's just a
[1:14:30] little bit out there. He's not exactly
[1:14:33] traditional the way that we have been so
[1:14:35] traditional and perfect in all of our
[1:14:38] ways. But what happened was
[1:14:41] Israel was destroyed because of it.
[1:14:44] There was a major captivity that
[1:14:45] happened because of it. But if they
[1:14:47] would have just listened to the word of
[1:14:49] the vindicated prophet, it wouldn't have
[1:14:51] happened the way that it did.
[1:14:54] Getting into our our scripture today.
[1:14:56] Well, I I guess I should just mention
[1:14:58] two other things. I apologize.
[1:15:01] Um because I really want to get into the
[1:15:03] word, too. But uh we do have the potluck
[1:15:06] today. And we just like to remind
[1:15:07] everyone if we could try and be timely.
[1:15:10] If if if you want to come later, you're
[1:15:12] certainly welcome to. But those people
[1:15:14] who want to eat together, we're going to
[1:15:15] aim for uh 2:30 uh as a time to eat and
[1:15:20] uh we trust that will be okay for
[1:15:22] everyone. And I would just like to bring
[1:15:24] a greetings from a brother that I got to
[1:15:27] meet in Philippines with uh with brother
[1:15:30] Mvin when we were there last at this
[1:15:32] Asians minister meeting. And the
[1:15:35] brother's name is Manahheim
[1:15:38] Sonong
[1:15:40] and he is a minister. He's a pastor from
[1:15:42] Indonesia and I have to say he is the
[1:15:45] sweetest brother, just one of the
[1:15:47] sweetest people that you would ever
[1:15:48] meet. And uh I just believe the Lord put
[1:15:51] him on my heart today. I don't know why.
[1:15:53] So I just reached out to him and you
[1:15:55] know we had a little bit of a a
[1:15:56] conversation and he said, "Please greet
[1:15:58] the saints in Calgary for me and and the
[1:16:02] church here and my family." So bring you
[1:16:04] greetings from brother Mannheim in
[1:16:06] Indonesia this morning.
[1:16:10] Today is a very special service and uh I
[1:16:13] never take it lightly when we enter into
[1:16:15] this kind of a service and I I just
[1:16:18] believe out of Romans chapter 8 I I want
[1:16:21] to encourage this to anyone who ever
[1:16:24] gets just a little bit down in their in
[1:16:26] their minds or down in their spirit. And
[1:16:30] I'm so thankful that, you know, my
[1:16:32] pastor, he taught me this scripture
[1:16:34] here. And uh I was so blessed to be able
[1:16:37] to get it, to listen to it, and and to
[1:16:42] perceive it. And you know, it's one
[1:16:44] thing for us to read it and and to
[1:16:46] listen to it and to try and perceive it,
[1:16:49] but it's it's a whole other level when
[1:16:51] the teacher comes and and when the
[1:16:53] spirit of God ministers the word to us.
[1:16:57] And and we've heard it many times. We'll
[1:16:59] say it again. We can read the text as a
[1:17:02] newspaper and and we can study the Bible
[1:17:06] as a text and we can study other manuals
[1:17:10] about text, historical documents and we
[1:17:13] can have a tremendous knowledge about
[1:17:15] the word of God and about all of the
[1:17:18] different gospels. But when the spirit
[1:17:21] of truth comes into our life, into our
[1:17:23] heart, this book becomes a brand new
[1:17:26] book. And and you know, we had a
[1:17:29] vindicated prophet that taught us from
[1:17:30] the King James version. And I know
[1:17:32] there's a lot of people that want to try
[1:17:33] and argue and debate on all the
[1:17:35] different availabilities of versions of
[1:17:37] the Bible. And that's fine. You're
[1:17:39] welcome to do that. But as for me, in my
[1:17:41] house, we'll serve the Lord according to
[1:17:42] the King James version because that's
[1:17:44] what the vindicated prophet of our age
[1:17:47] taught from. Everyone else can do
[1:17:49] whatever you feel led to do. And I I had
[1:17:52] a conversation with someone once upon a
[1:17:54] time about just just a a simple thing,
[1:17:57] but you know, sometimes questions can
[1:17:59] come up and and they can be almost like
[1:18:01] trick questions. And one of the
[1:18:03] questions that I got in a conversation
[1:18:05] was about mixed marriage. And we know
[1:18:07] that that's a very contentious issue in
[1:18:09] the Bible uh in in the word for our day,
[1:18:12] call it the word for our day, not in the
[1:18:14] Bible. I stand corrected with that. With
[1:18:15] the message of the hour, brother
[1:18:17] Brandham, he said, "Don't do it." and
[1:18:19] and we could have a big long discussion
[1:18:21] all about that. But my immediate answer
[1:18:23] to the person was, you know, some might
[1:18:26] say even it's just a a simple way out.
[1:18:28] It's a an easy way out. But I think it's
[1:18:30] the only way out. Brothers and sisters,
[1:18:32] I said, "First things first, before you
[1:18:34] get married ever, don't even think about
[1:18:37] marriage until you know for sure you
[1:18:40] have the Holy Ghost." Amen. If you're
[1:18:42] talking about getting married and all of
[1:18:44] the other things without having the Holy
[1:18:47] Ghost in your life, you're headed for
[1:18:48] the falls. Brother Brandham called it
[1:18:50] hell on earth. And if you've ever
[1:18:52] experienced divorce, I can tell you for
[1:18:55] sure it is.
[1:18:59] But many times we can get caught up in
[1:19:01] in ideas and and traditions and uh even
[1:19:04] questions that can be very difficult to
[1:19:06] answer. And I just want to say this,
[1:19:08] brothers and sisters, get the spirit of
[1:19:10] Christ. And there's only one way to do
[1:19:11] it. You might be wondering, why are you
[1:19:13] going off on this? Because something
[1:19:14] special is going to happen today. Sister
[1:19:16] Haley Wheeler has the desire to get
[1:19:18] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:21] Christ, not just to get baptized.
[1:19:25] If if we're getting baptized just to get
[1:19:27] baptized, we're going down as a wet
[1:19:29] sinner and coming up as a wet sinner.
[1:19:31] But when we desire to get the baptism of
[1:19:34] the Holy Ghost, there's only one way
[1:19:35] that's going to happen, and that's to
[1:19:37] actually follow the word of God. And we
[1:19:39] know for sure in the house of house of
[1:19:41] Cornelius, they didn't even have to have
[1:19:43] water to get the Holy Ghost. While Peter
[1:19:46] yet spake these words, what happened?
[1:19:48] The Holy Ghost fell on them. And you
[1:19:49] know, that's what my desire would be for
[1:19:51] us today. While we yet speak these
[1:19:53] words, the Holy Ghost would fall in our
[1:19:56] service. For those people that have the
[1:19:58] Holy Ghost, they'll just say, "Amen."
[1:19:59] They'll perceive it, and this will be
[1:20:01] home. This will be like heaven for them.
[1:20:03] And those people that have never
[1:20:05] perceived what it truly means to see the
[1:20:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their life
[1:20:10] that it would become real to them. That
[1:20:12] it would be something like they've never
[1:20:14] experienced. Like our sister said that
[1:20:15] she has never had that kind of a joy.
[1:20:18] Because that's the only real joy to a
[1:20:20] believer is the spirit of Christ in
[1:20:22] them.
[1:20:25] But you know, to not go all the way,
[1:20:28] what a sad place to live. Brother Bradom
[1:20:30] says it very clearly. we could become
[1:20:31] the most miserable people on earth. Why
[1:20:34] would we want to pretend? Why would we
[1:20:37] not want to go all the way over River
[1:20:39] Jordan? Why would we not want to die out
[1:20:42] to oursel? Because this flesh doesn't
[1:20:44] want to die. This flesh wants to live.
[1:20:47] The creature, if you go back and read in
[1:20:49] Romans chapter 8, it talks about the
[1:20:51] creature. The creature was made in
[1:20:54] vanity. The creature doesn't want to
[1:20:56] die. But we know that Christ came and
[1:20:59] died for the creature. So that the
[1:21:01] creature doesn't actually have to die.
[1:21:04] The spirit inside the creature has to
[1:21:06] die. Why does that happen? Because he
[1:21:09] will not share his glory with anyone.
[1:21:12] Having the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:14] not me plus him or him plus me. It's me
[1:21:18] decreasing all the way out of the way so
[1:21:20] that he can increase inside my life. So
[1:21:22] that the people around me can say, "What
[1:21:25] is it about you? something different has
[1:21:27] taken place in your life because the
[1:21:29] word of God says that we become a new
[1:21:31] creature. We do not stay the same. And
[1:21:33] for those people who actually maybe are
[1:21:36] the same way that they were 10 years
[1:21:37] ago, I want to encourage you just lift
[1:21:39] your cup up a little higher and ask him
[1:21:41] to pour some more of himself in you
[1:21:43] because any person that's staying the
[1:21:45] same, you're dying.
[1:21:48] The universal law in this world is
[1:21:50] you're either growing or you're dying.
[1:21:54] You don't remain neutral. You don't stay
[1:21:56] the same way. Amen.
[1:22:00] Sister Haley Wheeler, God bless you for
[1:22:02] following the leadership of the Lord in
[1:22:04] your life. She's recently moved to
[1:22:05] Calgary. I believe she wants to attend
[1:22:07] church here with us. She knows all about
[1:22:10] the message of the hour and she wants
[1:22:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, you
[1:22:14] know what? Where you want the baptism of
[1:22:16] the Holy Ghost, there's a Holy Ghost
[1:22:18] baptism just for you, sister. And you
[1:22:21] know, I think it's just so beautiful. It
[1:22:23] it's, you know, Matthew 28:19 and 20.
[1:22:27] We could we could actually just let's
[1:22:29] take a look over in the book of Acts for
[1:22:31] a second.
[1:22:34] Over in the book of Acts, I just want to
[1:22:35] dwell on this for a second. I'm never
[1:22:37] going to ever underestimate this. We
[1:22:40] know that. Brother Brandham says that we
[1:22:41] can never overestimate the importance of
[1:22:44] revelation. How is revelation going to
[1:22:46] come to us?
[1:22:48] Revelation is going to come to us
[1:22:50] according to the word of God.
[1:22:53] But you know, we're not going to have
[1:22:55] true revelation
[1:22:57] without the spirit of God.
[1:23:00] It takes the spirit to quicken the word.
[1:23:04] Many times people want to take the law
[1:23:07] and try and quicken the word.
[1:23:10] But we know the law kleth, the letter
[1:23:13] kleth, but the spirit giveth life.
[1:23:17] Hallelujah. So for the sake of time when
[1:23:19] we do the baptism I just want to explain
[1:23:21] a little bit about this I think it's so
[1:23:23] important you know when we look at this
[1:23:25] we we follow this very closely in Acts 2
[1:23:29] verse 37
[1:23:31] it says now when they heard this they
[1:23:34] were pricricked in their heart and said
[1:23:37] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:23:39] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:23:41] do wow we've heard something like we've
[1:23:44] never heard before and you know what's
[1:23:46] shocking really when you think about it
[1:23:48] that they would be behaving this way.
[1:23:50] This is something that we've never heard
[1:23:51] before. But yet that's exactly what they
[1:23:54] did. They said, "What shall we do?" Then
[1:23:57] Peter said unto them, "Repent." The
[1:24:00] first step is repentance. Godly
[1:24:02] repentance. We've got to know that we're
[1:24:05] born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come
[1:24:07] into the world speaking lies. We're all
[1:24:08] sinners. Whether we believe it or not,
[1:24:10] whether we understand it or not, we are.
[1:24:13] And unless we're willing to accept that,
[1:24:15] we actually are not going to see this
[1:24:17] promise of God come to fruition in our
[1:24:19] life. But when we recognize that we're
[1:24:20] sinners that need to be saved by grace,
[1:24:23] God is more than able. Amen.
[1:24:26] Then Peter said unto them, "Repent
[1:24:29] first, and be baptized, every one of
[1:24:32] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[1:24:33] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[1:24:36] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:24:37] Amen. For the promise is unto you and to
[1:24:40] your children and to all that are a far
[1:24:42] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[1:24:44] shall call. And brother Brandham in the
[1:24:46] church age book, he brings this out and
[1:24:47] he says it's for the Jews, but it's also
[1:24:49] for the Gentiles.
[1:24:51] Even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:24:53] call. And thank the Lord that he's still
[1:24:55] calling. Isn't it wonderful?
[1:24:58] You know, we can turn over to Matthew
[1:25:00] 28. Let's just do that quickly just for
[1:25:03] uh just for the sake of discussion here.
[1:25:05] I think it's really important. Matthew
[1:25:07] chapter 28, we know this is the great
[1:25:10] commission. This is where all of
[1:25:13] Christendom, all denominationalism
[1:25:16] places their bets. This is where they
[1:25:18] put all of their ministry.
[1:25:22] In Matthew 28:1 19, "Go ye therefore,"
[1:25:25] this is Jesus talking to them, by the
[1:25:27] way, "Go ye therefore and teach all
[1:25:29] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[1:25:32] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:25:35] Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all
[1:25:39] things whatsoever I commanded you. And
[1:25:42] lo, I am with you always, even unto the
[1:25:46] end of the world." Amen. Amen. Sometimes
[1:25:48] we can take a scripture and say, "Well,
[1:25:50] that's exactly what it says." But let's
[1:25:52] not forget the disciple Matthew, who
[1:25:55] actually was not the author of this, by
[1:25:58] the way. He was the scribe. He's the one
[1:26:01] that actually put the pen to the paper.
[1:26:03] But we know the Holy Ghost is the
[1:26:05] author. Many times it's it's worded this
[1:26:08] way that there's all these different
[1:26:10] authors in the Bible. There's only one
[1:26:11] author of the of the Bible. It's the
[1:26:14] spirit that we've already read about.
[1:26:16] But here we have Matthew, the scribe,
[1:26:19] writing this down. These are the words
[1:26:20] of Jesus. Matthew knew who was the name
[1:26:24] of the father. He knew who he was. Amen.
[1:26:28] Matthew knew who the son was.
[1:26:32] And he knew there was a promise of the
[1:26:33] Holy Ghost. But who would that be? Not a
[1:26:37] second person or a third person or a
[1:26:40] first person. The person of Jesus
[1:26:43] Christ. And I love how brother Brandham
[1:26:45] brings it out. I'm not going to quote it
[1:26:46] today. I'm not going to kill us with
[1:26:48] quotes today. For those people who get
[1:26:50] nervous with quotes, don't worry. I have
[1:26:52] one quote that I'm going to bring. And
[1:26:53] uh again, I apologize. I forgot to send
[1:26:56] it. I meant to, but here we go. I'll
[1:26:58] I'll just go easy with it. I'm not going
[1:27:00] to do it now, though, just for the sake
[1:27:01] of it. But you know, brother Bradam, he
[1:27:04] he said that the disciples, they knew
[1:27:07] Jesus.
[1:27:08] They knew him. He was their friend. We
[1:27:12] know that he said to them, "I no longer
[1:27:14] call you servants, but I call you
[1:27:17] friends." Amen. So they understood who
[1:27:20] Jesus was.
[1:27:22] It didn't become a mystery. We know
[1:27:24] where this came into play. This was at
[1:27:26] Nasia Rome many years later but not very
[1:27:30] many. Let's turn over to uh Mark chapter
[1:27:34] 16 just for the sake of discussion this
[1:27:36] morning about this this great commission
[1:27:39] this this go into the world and and get
[1:27:42] baptized business that we're talking
[1:27:45] about.
[1:27:46] Verse 15 it says, "And this is Mark 16,
[1:27:50] the great commission." Mark chapter
[1:27:53] 16:15. And he said unto them, "Go ye
[1:27:55] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:27:58] to every creature." So he's actually
[1:28:00] saying exactly what Jesus said in the
[1:28:03] prior chapter, the prior book in in
[1:28:06] Mark. Go ye into all the world, preach
[1:28:09] the gospel to every creature, and he
[1:28:10] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:28:14] saved. But he that believeth not shall
[1:28:17] be damned. And we know these signs shall
[1:28:20] follow them that believe in my name.
[1:28:21] They shall cast out devils. They shall
[1:28:23] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[1:28:24] up serpents. And if they drink any
[1:28:27] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[1:28:29] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:28:31] they shall recover. And we know that the
[1:28:33] Lord was consumed up in a cloud. After
[1:28:35] that, they watched them steadfastly go
[1:28:37] up to heaven. Getting into the book of
[1:28:39] Acts there. But you know this this this
[1:28:42] part is a very interesting thing as well
[1:28:44] because you know you have the pendulum
[1:28:45] it swings one way and then it swings the
[1:28:47] other way. It goes back and forth. And
[1:28:49] some people say, "Well, it has to be
[1:28:50] literally the father, the son, and the
[1:28:52] holy ghost." And you have the pendulum
[1:28:53] go all the way to the other side and
[1:28:55] they'll say, "You know what we're going
[1:28:56] to do? We're going to have a vial of
[1:28:57] poison on the pulpit and we're going to
[1:28:59] get a box of rattlesnakes and we're
[1:29:01] going to get in the spirit and and we
[1:29:03] know that that's the word of God, right?
[1:29:05] One extreme is just as extreme as the
[1:29:07] other extreme. Amen. We know that Jesus
[1:29:11] went out into the wilderness when he was
[1:29:12] filled with the Holy Ghost and he had
[1:29:15] Satan come around and tempt him three
[1:29:17] times. And what did he do? He defeated
[1:29:19] Satan every single time. One way
[1:29:23] with the word of God.
[1:29:25] Hallelujah. And unless we're willing to
[1:29:28] follow the word of God, we're not going
[1:29:30] to see the power of God manifest.
[1:29:33] We're going to actually be justified,
[1:29:37] but we might not be actually glorified.
[1:29:39] We might not actually have the true
[1:29:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Many people
[1:29:45] can witness the power of God fall in a
[1:29:47] meeting. Many people can witness the
[1:29:49] power of God move in their lives, but it
[1:29:52] doesn't mean you have the baptism of the
[1:29:53] Holy Ghost if you're not willing to say
[1:29:56] amen to every single word of God. Amen.
[1:29:58] According to the vindicated prophet, do
[1:30:00] you have the Holy Ghost?
[1:30:02] If if we're willing to substitute and
[1:30:04] make excuses for the word of God, do we
[1:30:08] truly have the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:09] Ghost? If the word of God says that, you
[1:30:13] know, it's wrong for a man to lie with a
[1:30:15] man, and that's called homosexuality in
[1:30:18] the world in which we live in, and the
[1:30:20] word of God says that it's an
[1:30:21] abomination, we know that Christians all
[1:30:24] over the place say amen to that. Amen.
[1:30:27] man with man, man with woman, whatever
[1:30:29] else you want to come up with. This
[1:30:30] world is full of it. You don't have to
[1:30:32] go very far. And I apologize for being
[1:30:34] blunt about this. But you know, the
[1:30:37] exact same word abomination is used for
[1:30:39] a woman that wears a garment that
[1:30:41] pertains to a man.
[1:30:44] Why is it? Because in the sight of God,
[1:30:47] it's abomination. Amen. But it also says
[1:30:51] if a man wears a garment exactly the
[1:30:53] same according to the word of God. If a
[1:30:55] man wears a garment that pertains to a
[1:30:57] woman, it's also abomination.
[1:31:01] It's not just heavy-handed towards the
[1:31:03] women, which many times it is.
[1:31:06] What's good for the goose is also good
[1:31:09] for the gander, isn't it?
[1:31:11] It's for the believer.
[1:31:13] And the believer is the one that's going
[1:31:15] to say, "Amen. Maybe I never heard that
[1:31:17] before, but you know, I like it. Where
[1:31:19] is it in the Bible? I want to go and
[1:31:21] find it. And if it is, then I'm willing
[1:31:23] to say, "Amen." And I'm going to change
[1:31:25] my life to pattern after the word. I'm
[1:31:27] not going to try and take the word and
[1:31:29] find an excuse or another version of the
[1:31:32] Bible that's going to be nice and calm
[1:31:34] and and clean and make it easy for me to
[1:31:36] do the lifestyle that I want to live
[1:31:39] because you'll find it if you want it.
[1:31:41] Amen. But I want to encourage us, you
[1:31:43] know, if God did send a prophet, which
[1:31:45] he did. Amen. But if he did, just for
[1:31:47] the sake of discussion, follow his
[1:31:50] instruction. Just follow his word.
[1:31:54] And you know, today talking about
[1:31:56] baptism, I think it's so beautiful.
[1:31:58] Amen. We've looked at these at these
[1:32:00] scriptures and and how they've been
[1:32:02] given. And you know, they can be just
[1:32:03] one extreme to the other. We've talked
[1:32:05] about that. And you know, in Acts 2:38,
[1:32:07] we we read already, and I think it's so
[1:32:09] beautiful because e even in my Bible, I
[1:32:12] I love the the notes that it has. Even
[1:32:15] in my Bible, it's called Peter's sermon.
[1:32:18] And I'm sure in many people's Bibles,
[1:32:20] it's called Peter's Sermon. Many times,
[1:32:21] it's referred to as Peter's sermon. But
[1:32:24] I I believe just like it is not the acts
[1:32:27] of the apostles in the book of Acts. It
[1:32:30] is not the acts of the apostles. It is
[1:32:32] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:32:35] apostles.
[1:32:37] We need to make sure that we're giving
[1:32:38] credit where it's due. It's just like
[1:32:41] plagiarizing the prophet. And that's
[1:32:43] where we talked about it on Wednesday. I
[1:32:45] thought it was so amazing. Some people
[1:32:47] might think brother Barry did a whole
[1:32:49] study on paring the prophet. I never had
[1:32:50] one note on paring the prophet on
[1:32:52] Wednesday. But you know, they just have
[1:32:54] to follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:32:56] Ghost, the leadership of the spirit. And
[1:32:58] you know, we could be paring the prophet
[1:33:01] very easily, but who wants to just talk
[1:33:05] and not walk?
[1:33:07] That's the most miserable place to live
[1:33:09] because you can talk all you want, but
[1:33:11] then you don't have the joy of the Lord
[1:33:13] in your life because you know that
[1:33:14] you're not living according to the word
[1:33:16] of God. And you know, you can bluff
[1:33:18] yourself maybe a little bit. You might
[1:33:20] try and bluff your spouse a little bit,
[1:33:22] but you can bluff bluff brothers and
[1:33:23] sisters a little bit. But you'll never
[1:33:25] bluff God and you'll never bluff the
[1:33:27] devil. But boy oh boy, when the devil
[1:33:30] sees that we get serious, when we get
[1:33:32] right down to businessmen with God in
[1:33:35] our lives, when the devil sees that,
[1:33:37] that's when he trembles. That's when he
[1:33:39] says, "I need to take a step back
[1:33:41] because I can't deal with this person."
[1:33:43] And we know that's what happened to
[1:33:44] Goliath. The whole church in Israel,
[1:33:48] what were they? They were they were
[1:33:49] trembling. Even the one who was head and
[1:33:51] shoulders above all the rest saw the
[1:33:53] king. Oh my, he was he was a warrior,
[1:33:55] that man. But what did he do? He was
[1:33:58] afraid. And all the people fed on his
[1:34:00] fear. All of the church fed on his fear.
[1:34:03] And you know, brothers and sisters, I
[1:34:05] don't want to be afraid. Amen. I'm not
[1:34:07] going to be a Saul. Oh my. I say, Lord,
[1:34:09] help me be a David to come up and say
[1:34:12] without fear, are you serious right now?
[1:34:16] that giant's going to step into our
[1:34:18] congregation and start boasting against
[1:34:20] the children of the living God. Are you
[1:34:23] serious? We're not going to allow that.
[1:34:27] No way. This uncircumcised Philistine
[1:34:29] has no rights. And you know, Brother
[1:34:31] Brandham brought it out very clearly
[1:34:33] that that circumcis uncircumcised
[1:34:35] Philistine, he was the same as a devil.
[1:34:37] That's right. And he boasted his claims.
[1:34:40] He said, you know, you you you I sent I
[1:34:42] asked for a champion, man. You send me a
[1:34:44] little kid. Are you serious?
[1:34:49] He said, you know, today I'm going to
[1:34:50] take you, little boy, and I'm going to
[1:34:51] feed you to the birds. Amen. I'm going
[1:34:53] to put you on the end of my spear and
[1:34:55] I'm going to feed you to the birds.
[1:34:58] And that little boy with just a little
[1:35:00] bit of revelation, what'd he say? He
[1:35:02] said, "You know what? You come to me
[1:35:04] with staves and spears, but I come to
[1:35:06] you in the spirit of the living God. I
[1:35:10] know that you're a trespasser, and you
[1:35:12] have no power here.
[1:35:14] But you know, David came ready, didn't
[1:35:16] he?
[1:35:18] David didn't just turn up without
[1:35:20] praying. David didn't turn up without
[1:35:23] going down to the brook and carefully
[1:35:25] selecting five stones.
[1:35:27] Amen. And you know, it's been said many
[1:35:30] times that there's a reason why he had
[1:35:32] five stones. I don't think it says it in
[1:35:33] the Bible, but we know that this giant
[1:35:36] had four brothers, didn't he? David came
[1:35:38] ready. He came prepared. And I can't
[1:35:41] help but think, brothers and sisters,
[1:35:42] when we gather together this way, let's
[1:35:44] come prepared.
[1:35:46] Let's go down to the brook and find some
[1:35:48] smooth stones and recognize the power
[1:35:50] within us. But you know, the word says
[1:35:55] that in the latter days, the latter
[1:35:57] times, that the love of many should wax
[1:35:59] cold. Why? Because of iniquity.
[1:36:03] Because of iniquity. Iniquity is doing
[1:36:05] things that we know we shouldn't do.
[1:36:07] Amen. and not doing things that we know
[1:36:09] we should do. And I say, "Lord, help me.
[1:36:12] Lord, help me. I know that I have
[1:36:15] iniquity in my heart. I know that David
[1:36:17] had iniquity in his heart." But you know
[1:36:19] what we can do is bring that to the Lord
[1:36:21] and say, "Lord, have mercy on me. I
[1:36:23] don't want to have iniquity in my heart.
[1:36:25] I don't want to have sin in my heart."
[1:36:27] And we know that sin is not smoking,
[1:36:29] drinking, carousing, and all that
[1:36:31] garbage.
[1:36:32] Sin is simply not believing the word of
[1:36:35] God. Not actually believing that God is
[1:36:38] able to deliver us. But you know this
[1:36:41] sermon here, Peter's sermon in the book
[1:36:43] of Acts, they were all filled with the
[1:36:45] Holy Ghost. They believed what their
[1:36:47] friend told them to go and tarry ye in
[1:36:49] Jerusalem and wait until you're endued
[1:36:52] with what? Power from on high. And when
[1:36:55] you are, go out and then follow my
[1:36:58] instructions that I told you about.
[1:37:00] Don't go and try and get into the acts
[1:37:02] first. Brother Brandham says get in the
[1:37:05] spirit first. When you can get in the
[1:37:07] spirit first, all of the acts will
[1:37:09] follow. But you know, this wasn't
[1:37:11] Peter's sermon. What Peter did was
[1:37:13] simply said what the prophets had said.
[1:37:17] And I think that's the beautiful thing
[1:37:18] about the day in which we live. We have
[1:37:21] been given the vindicated prophet's word
[1:37:23] for the day in which we live. And that
[1:37:25] will give us the ability to get the
[1:37:28] token in our lives. And we know the
[1:37:30] token in our lives is the true baptism
[1:37:33] of the Holy Ghost. Even though there's a
[1:37:35] lot of impersonators in this world,
[1:37:37] there has to be a genuine. There cannot
[1:37:39] be impersonation without an actual
[1:37:41] genuine. There can't be a counterfeit
[1:37:43] bill without there being a genuine
[1:37:46] original.
[1:37:47] That's what this sermon is, the genuine
[1:37:50] original. I think it's so beautiful. It
[1:37:52] is not the Acts of the Apostles. It's
[1:37:54] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:37:56] apostles and the day in which we live
[1:37:57] today, brothers and sisters, it's not
[1:37:59] our acts. When something goes good in
[1:38:01] our life, it's not us. It's the acts of
[1:38:04] the Holy Ghost living out through us
[1:38:06] because we know the prophet in our day
[1:38:08] said they will write another book of
[1:38:11] acts behind the lives of th those
[1:38:14] believers. But this what we commonly
[1:38:16] call Peter's sermon is 1 Thessalonians
[1:38:19] 5:7. It's Joel 2:28-30.
[1:38:23] It's Matthew 26:24. It's Luke 22:22.
[1:38:27] It's Psalms 16:8. It's Filimon 2:9. It's
[1:38:32] John 14:26 and 10:25.
[1:38:35] This is not the Peter uh uh sermon,
[1:38:39] Peter sermon. This is the acts of the
[1:38:43] Holy Ghost in Peter speaking what was
[1:38:46] already spoken. Amen. And you know what
[1:38:50] did they do right at the beginning? It
[1:38:52] says it in the book of Acts chapter 2.
[1:38:55] After the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:38:57] come, what happened? They gave utterance
[1:39:00] according to the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[1:39:03] Ghost gave utterance through every
[1:39:06] single one of them. Amen. Even though we
[1:39:08] call this Peter's sermon, this is the
[1:39:09] Holy Ghost giving utterance. And you
[1:39:11] know, he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:39:14] and forever. And we know how it works.
[1:39:16] Brothers and sisters, if you've come to
[1:39:18] church and you want a blessing, it don't
[1:39:19] matter who is standing behind this
[1:39:21] pulpit. It doesn't matter if you're in
[1:39:25] tune with God. If you came prepared, you
[1:39:27] will receive a blessing according to
[1:39:30] your faith.
[1:39:32] The Holy Ghost will give utterance.
[1:39:37] And when that Holy Ghost does, brothers
[1:39:39] and sisters, it's only going to say
[1:39:41] what's already been said.
[1:39:44] when there's some kind of a new doctrine
[1:39:45] coming around the corner. When there's
[1:39:47] some kind of a a new mystery that maybe
[1:39:49] people don't talk about very much in the
[1:39:51] message. When there's some sort of a a
[1:39:53] seal or something else that's going on
[1:39:55] in the word that maybe in the message
[1:39:57] that people don't talk about. You know,
[1:39:59] the mysteries are history. We know that.
[1:40:01] It's very clear. But I I'm just excited.
[1:40:03] It gets me really excited when somebody
[1:40:05] wants to get the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:07] Ghost. And I trust that everyone in this
[1:40:09] building either has the baptism or wants
[1:40:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The true
[1:40:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost will cause us
[1:40:16] to line up with the word of God.
[1:40:19] Hallelujah. Did you enjoy the the
[1:40:21] service last week, our inalienable
[1:40:24] rights?
[1:40:27] Remember, brothers and sisters, Brother
[1:40:29] Bam, he says that it's our
[1:40:32] inalienable right to get the baptism of
[1:40:36] the Holy Ghost. It's our inalienable
[1:40:39] right to go on to the true baptism to be
[1:40:43] able to say amen to the word to be the
[1:40:45] sons and daughters of God. It is our
[1:40:48] inalienable
[1:40:50] right. And you know what is the
[1:40:52] definition of that? Just for the sake of
[1:40:54] discussion this morning I wanted to
[1:40:56] bring it forward one more time. It says
[1:40:58] that unable to be taken away from or
[1:41:02] given away by the possessor. Amen. So,
[1:41:05] if we're sons and daughters of God,
[1:41:06] truly elected before the foundation of
[1:41:09] the world, it is our inalienable right
[1:41:12] to go on to the true baptism of the Holy
[1:41:14] Ghost. When we get, excuse me, that true
[1:41:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost, we will never
[1:41:19] be able to have it taken away from us
[1:41:22] because we're sealed until the day of
[1:41:23] our redemption. We'll never be able to
[1:41:25] have it taken away from us. We're not
[1:41:27] saved today and then we're lost
[1:41:28] tomorrow. We don't come to church and
[1:41:31] have a Holy Ghost Hallelujah. hoe down
[1:41:34] and then go out into the world and trip
[1:41:36] and fall in our face and we're lost as
[1:41:38] lost can be. No, we fall down. We fail,
[1:41:43] but we get back up. That's the
[1:41:45] difference, brothers and sisters,
[1:41:47] between those who are simply justified
[1:41:49] that never truly go on to the baptism of
[1:41:51] the Holy Ghost and those people who are
[1:41:53] truly filled with the spirit of God.
[1:41:55] They're both going to fall. They're both
[1:41:57] going to stumble. They're both going to
[1:41:59] have questions and answers and concerns.
[1:42:01] But what's going to be the difference
[1:42:02] between them? One of them will get back
[1:42:05] up
[1:42:07] and go forwards and one of them will
[1:42:09] say, "Well, I just can't do it. I just
[1:42:11] can't live it. I just can't do it." And
[1:42:13] you're 100% correct about that because
[1:42:16] you never will.
[1:42:18] The only way you'll be able to live it
[1:42:20] is to stop trying to live it and die to
[1:42:23] yourself and allow Christ the Holy Ghost
[1:42:25] to come into your life and let him live
[1:42:27] it through you. Amen. But that's our
[1:42:30] inalienable right.
[1:42:33] Now, I'd like to get into our sermon
[1:42:37] today.
[1:42:38] And it's out of uh
[1:42:42] oh my, I just get excited about this.
[1:42:44] There's nothing else to talk about in my
[1:42:46] mind, brothers and sisters. We can talk
[1:42:48] about a lot of different things in this
[1:42:50] world. We can talk a lot about different
[1:42:52] things in the message of the hour, but
[1:42:53] you know, it it's going home time.
[1:42:57] Everyone around the world can see it
[1:42:59] that this is going home time. Everything
[1:43:03] is in order. Israel is in her homeland.
[1:43:05] The the world is gathering around Israel
[1:43:08] now. We can see all of the handwriting
[1:43:11] that's on the wall. How was there ever
[1:43:14] any interpretation about that
[1:43:15] handwriting on the wall business that we
[1:43:17] we hear about so often? Oh, the
[1:43:19] handwriting is on the wall. What was
[1:43:20] that? We know that was Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:43:23] son. Nebuchadnezzar's son actually
[1:43:26] decided to blaspheme the Holy Ghost to
[1:43:28] mock the Holy Ghost while he was
[1:43:30] partying down. It wasn't enough to drink
[1:43:33] all the alcohol out of the the styrofoam
[1:43:35] cups or the whatever cups they were
[1:43:37] using. What what he said, "We need to go
[1:43:39] and get those golden goblets. Those are
[1:43:41] are from the temple from those people
[1:43:43] who are held captive. Let's get those
[1:43:44] goblets and drink out of them. Let's go
[1:43:46] party out of them." Right? And we know
[1:43:50] that God said, "You know, I've had
[1:43:52] enough of you." Amen. It's over. It's
[1:43:54] over for you. The enemy is already at
[1:43:57] your door. And I'm going to write that
[1:43:59] on the wall with my finger. And we know
[1:44:01] that he did that in their party while
[1:44:03] they were partying. And this guy got so
[1:44:05] sobered up so quick. It says in the word
[1:44:07] of God that his knees knocked together.
[1:44:11] I always thought that was a cartoon
[1:44:13] thing, but the the fear of God is
[1:44:17] immense. Amen. You can only imagine how
[1:44:20] afraid that guy was when he realized,
[1:44:23] but we know that it took his wife for
[1:44:25] him to say, you know, your dad, he had
[1:44:26] this guy, he's a prophet. He actually
[1:44:29] was able to discern the thoughts and the
[1:44:31] intents of the heart to be able to
[1:44:32] interpret dreams. This guy had the
[1:44:35] spirit of God. And I think he's still in
[1:44:36] your kingdom. Maybe if you call him,
[1:44:37] he'd be able to tell you. Nobody could
[1:44:39] interpret what was written on the wall.
[1:44:40] And we know that he came and told them,
[1:44:42] "You know what? It's over for you."
[1:44:45] Can you imagine what that would have
[1:44:46] been like? But the handwriting, brothers
[1:44:49] and sisters, is on the wall for this
[1:44:52] world.
[1:44:53] It's judgment time. It's going home
[1:44:55] time. This is no time to be playing. We
[1:44:58] can talk about all the mysterious
[1:45:00] things, but I want to say this real
[1:45:01] clear. I think that's just a distraction
[1:45:03] by the devil who loves to go to church.
[1:45:06] We know that it's going to be so close
[1:45:07] it would deceive the very elected if it
[1:45:09] were possible. If people are only
[1:45:10] wanting to talk about deep things, how
[1:45:12] deep is the Holy Ghost? Amen.
[1:45:14] Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] Tell me how deep the Holy Ghost isn't.
[1:45:19] Christ himself, the author of this book,
[1:45:23] the one who sent the prophet to us.
[1:45:27] His spirit.
[1:45:29] My
[1:45:30] I think that is so beautiful because
[1:45:32] that's in our inalienable right is to
[1:45:35] have his spirit in our lives if we want
[1:45:38] it. But not everybody wants it. A lot of
[1:45:41] people just like the feeling of it. They
[1:45:43] just like the feeling of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:45] in their life. But when we truly get the
[1:45:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost, we say, "Be
[1:45:49] it unto me, Lord, according to thy word,
[1:45:51] which is thy will." Just whatever you
[1:45:53] need to do. If it takes my hide off me,
[1:45:55] just do it. It's okay. I'm okay with
[1:45:57] that. When we truly want to meet Christ,
[1:46:00] and you know what I want to talk about
[1:46:01] today is the mind of the spirit out of
[1:46:03] Romans 8 verse 27. And he that searchth
[1:46:09] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
[1:46:12] the spirit. Amen. Because he maketh
[1:46:16] intercession for the saints according to
[1:46:19] the will of God. Amen.
[1:46:23] I love this scripture because it says he
[1:46:25] that searchth the hearts. We know that
[1:46:28] he's right here right now in this room.
[1:46:29] Brothers and sisters, he's not just
[1:46:30] sitting in a chair here in the corner.
[1:46:33] For some people he is. Amen. But for the
[1:46:35] believers, he's going heart to heart.
[1:46:39] Heart to heart. Heart to heart. And he's
[1:46:42] saying, "Do you believe? Do you believe?
[1:46:44] Do you believe? Do you believe?" And for
[1:46:47] the people that do believe, they're
[1:46:48] saying, "Amen. I believe, Lord, be it
[1:46:50] unto me according to thy word." But you
[1:46:52] know what's interesting is we can say it
[1:46:54] with our lips and have our hearts very
[1:46:56] far from him. He that searchth the
[1:46:59] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[1:47:02] spirit. And we know that the word of God
[1:47:04] says, "Let this mind also be in you." If
[1:47:09] we still have our mind, he's searching
[1:47:11] it and he's telling us, "You need to die
[1:47:13] out. You need to stop doing it your way
[1:47:15] and you need to do it the way that I
[1:47:17] have given through the word of God in
[1:47:19] the day in which we live." Let's turn
[1:47:20] over to Philippians chapter 2.
[1:47:24] Philippians chapter 2.
[1:47:27] Philippians chapter 2.
[1:47:30] I think it's so beautiful.
[1:47:33] Amen.
[1:47:35] The mind of the spirit, brothers and
[1:47:37] sisters, the mind of Christ. Amen.
[1:47:43] Philippians chapter 2 verse one. If
[1:47:45] there be therefore any consolation in
[1:47:48] Christ, any comfort of love, if any
[1:47:52] fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels
[1:47:55] and mercies
[1:47:57] fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like
[1:48:01] minded. Amen. The mind of the spirit
[1:48:05] that you be likeminded, having the same
[1:48:07] love, being of one accord, of one mind.
[1:48:12] Amen. Amen. We know that James also
[1:48:14] talks about it how uh a man with a
[1:48:17] double mind, right? What is he? He's
[1:48:21] unstable in all of his ways. And you
[1:48:23] know, I I can't help but think about a
[1:48:26] double-minded man when when we see that.
[1:48:29] Sometimes it's not just unstable in in
[1:48:31] maybe making business deals, and maybe
[1:48:33] it's not unstable in getting degrees,
[1:48:35] and maybe it's not unstable in in
[1:48:37] different things. Maybe it's just simply
[1:48:39] unstable in being able to walk in the
[1:48:41] will of the Lord. Being able to get up
[1:48:44] and and go to church, being able to
[1:48:46] actually continually fellowship with the
[1:48:48] saints instead of getting upset and
[1:48:51] saying something happened and I just
[1:48:52] can't go to church anymore. That's not
[1:48:54] the spirit of Christ.
[1:48:56] It ain't.
[1:48:59] That's right. But if ye be likeminded,
[1:49:01] having the same love, being of one of
[1:49:04] cord, of one mind, let nothing be done
[1:49:06] through strife or vain glory. Oh my, I
[1:49:09] I'll only do it if there's an accolade.
[1:49:11] Is my name going to be printed in there
[1:49:12] somewhere?
[1:49:14] Is it going to be someone's church? Is
[1:49:17] it going to be our work together? Do I
[1:49:20] get my picture up there? Some people
[1:49:23] just love their picture.
[1:49:25] But let nothing be done through strife
[1:49:27] or vain glory. but in loneliness of
[1:49:30] mind.
[1:49:33] Not thinking that I'm better. I'm sure
[1:49:34] glad I'm not like them. My goodness,
[1:49:37] right? I wasn't born into that family.
[1:49:39] I'm sure glad I'm not like them.
[1:49:41] Brothers and sisters, that ain't the
[1:49:43] mind of Christ.
[1:49:45] If anything, we ought to be saying, "How
[1:49:47] can I help that family? How what can I
[1:49:49] do to make the situation better?"
[1:49:53] Being in one mind, in one accord,
[1:49:57] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:49:58] vain glory, but in loness of mind, let
[1:50:01] each esteem other better than
[1:50:04] themselves. Amen. Now, how many of us do
[1:50:06] that?
[1:50:08] Esteee one another better than
[1:50:10] ourselves. I'm going to say it clearly,
[1:50:11] brothers and sisters. In the world in
[1:50:13] which we live in, not many people do
[1:50:14] that. Not many people are willing to
[1:50:17] say, "I'm going to give you my very
[1:50:18] best." And I'll be I'll be real honest
[1:50:20] with you. I went and stayed. My wife and
[1:50:22] I did one time. We went to stay at
[1:50:23] someone's house and when we did, it was
[1:50:25] just an overnight time that we were
[1:50:27] staying there. But they were so adamant
[1:50:29] we had to take the master bedroom and we
[1:50:31] had to take everything like just have
[1:50:34] the best of the best of the best in the
[1:50:35] house. And we're like, "No, we're just
[1:50:37] guests. We just want a couch. We don't
[1:50:39] want to overtake your house. That's your
[1:50:40] private area." No, you have to have the
[1:50:43] best.
[1:50:46] According to the scripture, we said,
[1:50:47] "Okay,
[1:50:49] okay." But you know, sometimes
[1:50:53] it's rude to actually turn down a gift.
[1:50:56] It really is when somebody wants to give
[1:50:58] you their very best. When they want to
[1:51:00] give you a gift and you say, "No, no,
[1:51:01] no. I couldn't possibly. No, no, no, no,
[1:51:03] no. Why not?"
[1:51:05] Especially when they want to give you
[1:51:06] money.
[1:51:09] I'm just joking about that. But why
[1:51:11] would we want to rob someone of a
[1:51:12] blessing? Especially if they want to
[1:51:14] take the bill for lunch. Amen.
[1:51:19] Let nothing be done through strife or
[1:51:21] vain glory, but in lon loneliness of
[1:51:23] mind, let each esteem other better than
[1:51:26] themselves. And and the footnote word
[1:51:28] here says pride in my Bible. The
[1:51:31] original sin right in heaven. Lucifer
[1:51:35] thought that he actually deserved
[1:51:37] something better.
[1:51:38] But we know that he got what he is
[1:51:41] looking for.
[1:51:43] goes on to say, 'Look not every man on
[1:51:45] his own things, but every man also on
[1:51:47] the things of others.' And remember, we
[1:51:49] talked about this a while ago, the
[1:51:51] difference between Cain and Abel. Abel
[1:51:53] had the spirit of his father. Cain had
[1:51:56] the spirit of his father. We know there
[1:51:59] was two separate fathers. We know that
[1:52:02] Cain is not in the lineage of Adam. We
[1:52:05] just need to take a look at the word of
[1:52:07] God and we can read that. It says very
[1:52:09] clearly that Cain is not a part of the
[1:52:12] lineage of Adam. But the world would
[1:52:15] like to try and make it as though it's
[1:52:17] so
[1:52:19] because when you do that you can
[1:52:22] eliminate the word discussion about
[1:52:26] super fucandation.
[1:52:29] The whole idea that a mother can
[1:52:32] actually have two separate fathers at
[1:52:34] the same time, causing two separate
[1:52:36] babies to be born as twins,
[1:52:39] which actually is the apple that was
[1:52:42] eaten in the Garden of Eden.
[1:52:46] But look not every man on his own
[1:52:48] things, but every man also on the things
[1:52:51] of others. Now, why am I talking that
[1:52:53] way? Because Cain had a nature in him.
[1:52:55] He said when God came to him, he knew
[1:52:57] full well what happened, but he wanted
[1:52:58] to put it on him just to hear what he'd
[1:53:00] say. You know, give him a chance to even
[1:53:01] repent. He even gave him a space to
[1:53:03] repent. Amen. I personally believe that
[1:53:06] Cain could have repented for that murder
[1:53:07] even right there. Now, that could be
[1:53:09] challengeable, and I'm sorry. I I don't
[1:53:11] want to cause controversy, but that's
[1:53:13] the God we serve, right? Whether we tell
[1:53:15] a little bit of a lie or whether we
[1:53:17] actually do something really insidious
[1:53:20] in our lives, which one's worse? Which
[1:53:23] one's worse? A shady business deal or or
[1:53:27] just a a little bit of discussion about
[1:53:29] someone and and how they are behind
[1:53:31] their back? Which one's worse? Murder?
[1:53:34] We know that they're the same.
[1:53:38] Evil is evil. Sin is sin. The only
[1:53:41] difference is in this world that we live
[1:53:43] in, you have to pay different levels of
[1:53:46] recompense according to what Caesar
[1:53:48] requires
[1:53:50] before God. If you have sin in your
[1:53:52] life, you have sin in your life. But he
[1:53:55] came to Cain and he said, "Hey, where's
[1:53:57] your brother?" And what did Cain say? Am
[1:54:00] I my brother's keeper?
[1:54:03] Why would I know? Why would I care? It's
[1:54:05] not my problem.
[1:54:07] And isn't it interesting that this word
[1:54:09] says here, "Look not every man on his
[1:54:11] own things." Don't be like Cain. Don't
[1:54:13] be like Cain and say, "I've got my
[1:54:15] backyard perfectly clean." We know
[1:54:17] that's what the world teaches.
[1:54:20] But look on your other brothers, your
[1:54:22] other sisters,
[1:54:24] every man also on the things of others,
[1:54:27] and tend to the needs of your brothers
[1:54:29] and sisters. Amen.
[1:54:32] And the next verse, verse five, let this
[1:54:34] mind be in you which also was in Christ
[1:54:37] Jesus.
[1:54:38] And now this is where I think it's
[1:54:39] beautiful because it kind of slingshots
[1:54:41] us into the the culmination of the
[1:54:44] message of the hour right here.
[1:54:47] Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:54:49] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:54:52] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:54:54] with God. Amen. Who are you if you have
[1:54:58] his mind? Amen. We're not God.
[1:55:03] We're not Jesus.
[1:55:05] Say that again. We're we're not God and
[1:55:08] we're not Jesus, but we're Messiah
[1:55:12] because if you have a spoonful of the
[1:55:15] ocean, you have every single element of
[1:55:18] that ocean in that spoon.
[1:55:22] We have God with measure.
[1:55:26] Jesus was God without measure. Amen.
[1:55:29] Amen.
[1:55:34] But let this mind be in you which was
[1:55:36] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[1:55:39] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:55:41] equal with God.
[1:55:43] And some people want to take and make
[1:55:45] Jesus another person. They want to take
[1:55:48] and make Jesus just a brother.
[1:55:51] They want to take Jesus and just push
[1:55:53] him off to the side. And if that
[1:55:55] happens, brothers and sisters, if Jesus
[1:55:57] is not God, if Jesus was not equal with
[1:56:00] God, if Jesus never had the mind of God,
[1:56:02] if Jesus wasn't the person of God, if
[1:56:05] Jesus wasn't the one that God chose to
[1:56:08] come down and manifest a and and
[1:56:10] condescend to to be able to give man
[1:56:13] something to comprehend what God really
[1:56:16] is, who God really is, to give himself
[1:56:18] an identity to this world. If that
[1:56:20] wasn't the case, then we are all lost as
[1:56:23] lost can be.
[1:56:25] Because William, Mary, and Brandham did
[1:56:26] not come and die for man.
[1:56:31] My but some spirits around this message
[1:56:33] of the hour, they want to try and push
[1:56:35] Jesus off to Can you believe that? The
[1:56:38] audacity of those evil spirits that
[1:56:40] would try and take Jesus and make him
[1:56:42] anything less than he is. Amen.
[1:56:46] My
[1:56:49] But that's people that are allowing
[1:56:52] spirits to manipulate them in ways that
[1:56:54] those spirits would take them away from
[1:56:56] the true power of God.
[1:57:00] Because the word of God says, "Let this
[1:57:03] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:57:06] Jesus." Let this mind be in you. How
[1:57:09] many people here want this mind to be in
[1:57:12] you? Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I can't
[1:57:16] help but think that it's just critical
[1:57:18] for us to have his mind in us. Amen.
[1:57:21] Because you know, when our flesh says
[1:57:23] that you fell and you're a disaster and
[1:57:27] and you don't even like to look at
[1:57:28] yourself in the mirror, speaking from
[1:57:30] experience. This is my talk. The talk
[1:57:33] that comes to me, the spirit of Christ
[1:57:35] rises up in me and says, "Yeah, but
[1:57:38] that's not how he looks at you." Amen.
[1:57:40] And remember, he doesn't look at us the
[1:57:42] way that we look at ourselves. He only
[1:57:43] looks at us the way that he created us
[1:57:45] before the foundation of the world. He's
[1:57:47] currently looking at our theophony
[1:57:48] bodies saying, "Wow, it's getting so
[1:57:51] close. One of these days, those spirits
[1:57:54] down there are going to actually
[1:57:56] intertwine with these theophony bodies."
[1:57:59] Just any day now, brothers and sisters.
[1:58:01] Amen. You know, out of the Amplified
[1:58:03] Bible in Romans 8:26 26, it says, "So
[1:58:07] too, the Holy Spirit comes to our aid
[1:58:10] and bears us up in our weakness." Amen.
[1:58:15] For we do not know what prayer to offer,
[1:58:19] nor how to offer it worthily as we
[1:58:22] ought. Amen.
[1:58:24] Who here could honestly pray on their
[1:58:27] own accurately according to the word of
[1:58:31] God? The word of God says that we can't
[1:58:33] even do it. Amen.
[1:58:36] Brothers and sisters, that's why we have
[1:58:37] got to have his holy spirit. If we want
[1:58:40] to communicate with him, if we want him
[1:58:42] to communicate with us, we've got to
[1:58:44] have his spirit. It's not optional.
[1:58:46] Brother Brandham says if we don't get
[1:58:48] the Holy Ghost in our life, we're lost
[1:58:49] as lost can be. Amen. Amen. So, if we
[1:58:52] ever have any apprehension about the
[1:58:54] Holy Ghost preaching, I think there's
[1:58:56] something wrong. I've said it before.
[1:58:58] I'm going to say it again. I think it's
[1:58:59] real wrong. I think it's really wrong.
[1:59:01] There's got to be a Holy Ghost baptism
[1:59:03] in our lives, brothers and sisters.
[1:59:05] There's no greater honor in our lives
[1:59:07] than to let his mind be in us. But isn't
[1:59:11] it beautiful? He doesn't say, "Step
[1:59:13] aside because I'm going to punch my mind
[1:59:15] into you." He says, "Let this mind be in
[1:59:18] you." Which means there's a free will.
[1:59:20] There is a gate that has to be opened to
[1:59:23] say, "Be it unto me according to your
[1:59:24] word. Let your mind be in me." And I
[1:59:28] can't help but think, brothers and
[1:59:29] sisters, when we do that, that becomes
[1:59:31] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. That
[1:59:33] does become the true conversion that
[1:59:35] we're looking for. That does become the
[1:59:38] new birth. Amen.
[1:59:40] Now, remember in the exposition of the
[1:59:42] seven church ages, the new birth is the
[1:59:44] same thing. Amen. Let's not try and make
[1:59:46] it different. We're not converted until
[1:59:49] we have the spirit of Christ in us,
[1:59:51] brothers and sisters. We're good church
[1:59:53] members. We're great message people. But
[1:59:55] until we truly have the baptism of the
[1:59:57] Holy Ghost and become a new creature in
[2:00:00] Christ Jesus, we're just playing church.
[2:00:03] But we know some people say, "You got to
[2:00:05] fake it till you make it." Maybe some
[2:00:07] people would even say that in and around
[2:00:09] the message. Remember, the only people
[2:00:11] that are going to be faking it are the
[2:00:12] unbelievers and the makebelievers. Amen.
[2:00:15] Because the children, who's their Holy
[2:00:17] Ghost until their age of accountability?
[2:00:21] The parents are
[2:00:23] the parents are their Holy Ghost. So the
[2:00:25] parents have the Holy Ghost as
[2:00:27] believers. The children have the Holy
[2:00:29] Ghost as believers. It's just the makeel
[2:00:31] believers and the unbelievers. We need
[2:00:32] to try and encourage them to get in the
[2:00:35] boat.
[2:00:37] So too, the Holy Spirit comes to our aid
[2:00:40] and bears us up in our weakness because
[2:00:43] we have weakness. Amen. As long as we're
[2:00:45] in this flesh, we got weakness. Some
[2:00:47] people have weakness in different ways
[2:00:49] and other people have weakness in other
[2:00:51] ways. We've all got weakness.
[2:00:53] And the one that says they don't have
[2:00:54] the weakness. You can see it right
[2:00:56] there. It's pride. It's pride because
[2:01:00] they're great. Everything is fine in
[2:01:02] their life. I don't have any issues in
[2:01:04] my life. I'm saved. I'm filled with the
[2:01:06] Holy Ghost. Amen. The honest ones are
[2:01:10] going to say, "Yeah,
[2:01:12] I I have weakness. And that's why we
[2:01:14] have this scripture. We wouldn't have
[2:01:16] this scripture if we didn't have
[2:01:17] weakness. For we do not know what prayer
[2:01:20] to offer, nor how to offer it worthily
[2:01:22] as we ought. But the spirit himself, I
[2:01:25] love how this is written here. Some
[2:01:27] people say the the Amplified Bible,
[2:01:29] Brother Barry, how could you? Blah blah
[2:01:31] blah. You know, this is only just to
[2:01:32] illustrate. But what I want to point out
[2:01:34] here, that's absolutely correct. And I'm
[2:01:36] sure that the believers will agree with
[2:01:37] me here. What is correct is that the
[2:01:40] spirit himself Amen. It doesn't say the
[2:01:44] spirit itself.
[2:01:46] It's not pushing it off into another
[2:01:48] entity. This is the person himself,
[2:01:51] Jesus Christ.
[2:01:54] The spirit himself goes to meet our
[2:01:57] supplication and pleads in our behalf
[2:02:00] with unspeakable yearnings and groanings
[2:02:02] too deep for utterance. Now, what do
[2:02:04] those sound like, brothers and sisters?
[2:02:06] We know that some people would say,
[2:02:07] "Well, it's glossy, Brother Barry. when
[2:02:09] we get down on our knees and we start to
[2:02:10] pray. We'll just start to bust a move
[2:02:12] and suddenly we'll be speaking in
[2:02:13] tongues. No, that's not it. But yet, it
[2:02:16] could be.
[2:02:18] I'm not going to say it is or it isn't.
[2:02:20] When that happens in the church or with
[2:02:22] a group of people, it's incorrect. But
[2:02:24] don't think for a second you can't be in
[2:02:26] prayer and start to sing in the spirit.
[2:02:29] Don't think that you can't actually
[2:02:31] begin to speak in another tongue because
[2:02:33] you can. I'm not trying to teach
[2:02:36] anything outside of the message of the
[2:02:37] hour. If someone's going to bring a
[2:02:39] message in tongues within the church,
[2:02:41] there's going to be an interpreter. It's
[2:02:43] not going to be in the middle of the
[2:02:44] preaching because that's out of order.
[2:02:45] It's only going to be after the service
[2:02:47] or potentially before the service, but
[2:02:49] there will be an interpretation.
[2:02:52] It won't be an unknown tongue that
[2:02:54] brings confusion.
[2:02:57] But isn't this beautiful to think about?
[2:03:00] And we can go back to the the King James
[2:03:02] version. Maybe we should just so people
[2:03:04] don't get nervous and and worried that
[2:03:07] brother brother Barry is going to try
[2:03:08] and bring something different here. But
[2:03:12] it says in verse 26, likewise the spirit
[2:03:14] also helpeth our infirmities, our
[2:03:17] weaknesses,
[2:03:19] for we know not what we should pray, for
[2:03:22] as oft as we ought. But the Spirit
[2:03:24] itself maketh intercession for us with
[2:03:26] groanings which cannot be uttered. And
[2:03:28] he that searchth the hearts knoweth what
[2:03:31] is the mind of the spirit.
[2:03:34] How could we ever have him pray within
[2:03:38] us? How could we ever have him be making
[2:03:40] intercession for us without his spirit
[2:03:43] in our lives?
[2:03:47] Don't think for a second, Sister Haley,
[2:03:49] that he's not going to grant you this.
[2:03:52] I want to encourage you to remember
[2:03:54] this. The spirit is what maketh
[2:03:57] intercession for us. He knows what our
[2:04:00] weaknesses are, even better than we do.
[2:04:04] And when he comes to town, it changes
[2:04:06] everything about us. The spirit himself
[2:04:10] goes to meet our supplication and pleads
[2:04:13] in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings
[2:04:15] and groanings too deep for utterance.
[2:04:17] It's not necessarily a voice that's
[2:04:19] going to come out of us. It's the spirit
[2:04:20] that rises up inside of us. The spirit
[2:04:23] that knows the heart that searchth the
[2:04:25] mind. It's his spirit inside of us. And
[2:04:28] he who searches the hearts of men knows
[2:04:32] what is in the mind of the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:35] What his intent is. Amen. Many times we
[2:04:39] pray and we'll want to pray for the
[2:04:40] wrong things because we want to do this
[2:04:42] thing in our life. We feel led to do
[2:04:44] this thing in our life. Is this thing
[2:04:46] actually going to help us or help others
[2:04:48] around us or is it actually just
[2:04:50] something that's going to make us feel
[2:04:51] good? Is it something that we're asking
[2:04:53] about to consume in the lust of our
[2:04:55] flesh or the lust of our mind?
[2:04:58] We need to know how we're praying. And
[2:05:00] and even more than that, I I think it's
[2:05:02] so beautiful when we look at this
[2:05:03] because this is I I don't know if it
[2:05:05] gets any deeper than this, brothers and
[2:05:06] sisters, because the spirit itself
[2:05:08] maketh the spirit himself maketh
[2:05:11] intercession for us.
[2:05:14] We're not making intercessions. We're
[2:05:16] we're praying and I'm praying for
[2:05:17] brother so and so and sister so and so
[2:05:19] and their children and their children
[2:05:20] and what they're going through and and
[2:05:22] and the other prayer request and the
[2:05:24] other problem and the other issue and
[2:05:25] the other unknown and I'm going through
[2:05:27] and I'm praying like that. But what's
[2:05:28] the spirit doing in the midst of my
[2:05:30] prayer?
[2:05:32] The spirit is searching the heart.
[2:05:35] The mind of Jesus Christ is searching
[2:05:38] what's in the heart. What's in the
[2:05:39] genuine heart? Now, is it my heart or is
[2:05:42] it his heart? Amen.
[2:05:44] Because this is where we get into
[2:05:46] discussion about the heart. What's the
[2:05:47] heart? Is it a is it a is it a muscle in
[2:05:49] the body that's pumping pumping pumping?
[2:05:51] Or is the heart the actual mind?
[2:05:55] Because what's in the heart? What is it
[2:05:56] out of the abundance of the heart the
[2:05:58] mouth speaketh? How how how much
[2:06:00] abundance is there inside of the heart
[2:06:02] to speak?
[2:06:03] There's nothing in there, right? It's
[2:06:05] blood and muscles with a little bit of
[2:06:07] electricity just happening and and
[2:06:08] pumping the blood around. It's getting
[2:06:10] our oil pressure up and keeping us
[2:06:11] going. But we're talking about the mind
[2:06:14] when we get into that. It's out of the
[2:06:17] mind. Out of the abundance of the mind,
[2:06:21] the mouth speaketh. Now, I'm not trying
[2:06:23] to add or take away from the word. I'm
[2:06:24] just doing that to illustrate, brothers
[2:06:26] and sisters, because it is truly out of
[2:06:27] the abundance of the heart, the mouth
[2:06:29] speaketh. And whatever truly is in our
[2:06:31] heart, that's what we're going to talk
[2:06:32] about. Some people want to talk about
[2:06:34] football, and that's all they want to
[2:06:35] talk about every time. You'll you'll
[2:06:38] meet them and they just want to talk
[2:06:39] about football. Other people, they'll
[2:06:41] just want to talk about work. And other
[2:06:42] people, they really like to get her done
[2:06:44] and talk about politics.
[2:06:46] They just like to talk about different
[2:06:48] things. And other people like to get
[2:06:49] together and talk about the word and
[2:06:50] talk about what the Lord is doing in
[2:06:52] their life and talk about all of the
[2:06:54] good things that the Lord has done for
[2:06:55] them and their children. Talk about all
[2:06:57] of the good things that the Lord has
[2:06:58] done in their marriages. Sometimes the
[2:07:00] good things actually are preceded by bad
[2:07:04] things, but they always turn into
[2:07:06] testimonies because we read it this
[2:07:07] morning. We know that all things work
[2:07:09] together for the good. Not to everyone.
[2:07:12] Some people will quote that scripture. A
[2:07:14] all things work together for the good.
[2:07:16] And stop. It doesn't always work
[2:07:18] together for the good. But it always
[2:07:20] works together for the good to those
[2:07:22] that love God.
[2:07:24] If we love God, it's going to work out
[2:07:26] to the good. And it might not be today.
[2:07:28] And it might not be tomorrow. Might not
[2:07:30] even be next year. We don't know. But we
[2:07:32] know that it will because it has to
[2:07:34] because he said it. Amen.
[2:07:38] All things work together for the good to
[2:07:40] them that love God. To them who are
[2:07:41] called according to his purpose.
[2:07:44] Purpose. A purpose-driven life. It ain't
[2:07:49] to have business and and to try and meet
[2:07:52] people and to try and encourage people.
[2:07:54] It's to be about the father's business.
[2:07:55] Amen. And if we seek first the kingdom
[2:07:58] of God, then all the other things he'll
[2:08:00] add to us. Amen. But sometimes we can
[2:08:02] actually just get those blended and
[2:08:04] blurred and say, "Well, God's leading me
[2:08:06] and so this is why I'm doing this." And
[2:08:08] if he is, if he's truly leading us, then
[2:08:11] we'll always be according to the word of
[2:08:12] God. We will not live our lives outside
[2:08:16] of the word of God and claim that God is
[2:08:18] leading us. If we are, then we're
[2:08:20] mistaken. But I think it's so beautiful.
[2:08:23] We have been given this word and and
[2:08:25] this word isn't just in print form. It's
[2:08:28] actually the spirit of the word. It is
[2:08:31] his mind in us. And you know, I I just
[2:08:34] think it's so beautiful when we talk
[2:08:35] about this. The level we're talking
[2:08:37] about today, brothers and sisters, is
[2:08:38] truly algebraic. This is problem solving
[2:08:42] on the next level. This is about those
[2:08:44] who he has fornown. Those people he's
[2:08:46] already predestinated. And those people
[2:08:48] he's already glorified. He's justified
[2:08:51] them. Everything in their life is
[2:08:52] already positionally placed. They don't
[2:08:55] have to worry at all. Amen. Thank you,
[2:08:57] Lord. But some people do actually worry
[2:09:00] a little bit. They just don't know. And
[2:09:02] I want to encourage us today, brothers
[2:09:03] and sisters. Don't don't be in a
[2:09:05] position where we have to wonder. We
[2:09:07] don't have to leave this building today
[2:09:09] wondering. Amen. We can leave this
[2:09:11] building with the full assurance, that
[2:09:13] blessed assurance that Jesus is mine.
[2:09:16] And as we leave here, we'll be able to
[2:09:18] say, "Oh, what a foretaste of glory
[2:09:21] divine."
[2:09:23] Born of his spirit and washed in his
[2:09:25] blood, recognizing that I am a child of
[2:09:29] the of of the king. But, you know, we're
[2:09:32] not going to get into this level, this
[2:09:34] level of preaching, this level of
[2:09:35] teaching, this level of understanding,
[2:09:37] understanding that, you know what? It's
[2:09:39] the spirit that searchth the mind and
[2:09:41] the hearts of the children. We're not
[2:09:43] going to get to there without knowing
[2:09:45] our ABCs.
[2:09:48] A and more than knowing our ABCs, when
[2:09:50] we know our ABCs, we do our ABCs.
[2:09:54] We don't just say that we we have to
[2:09:56] know the ABCs before we can get into the
[2:09:58] deep things.
[2:10:00] They become who we are. Amen. Thank you,
[2:10:03] Lord. And I can't help but think,
[2:10:04] brothers and sisters, that's what makes
[2:10:06] a pillar in the community of the church
[2:10:10] versus a churchgoer.
[2:10:12] Someone that just turns up once in a
[2:10:14] while. And I'm sorry for saying it that
[2:10:16] way, but I think it's time. We need to
[2:10:18] say it straight.
[2:10:20] This is not time to play church. We've
[2:10:22] already talked about that. We can see
[2:10:23] the handwriting on the wall in this
[2:10:25] world. We want to see everybody get to
[2:10:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. When we
[2:10:29] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we're
[2:10:30] going to actually live those ABCs. When
[2:10:32] we live those ABCs, the spirit of Christ
[2:10:34] is going to live out through us. There's
[2:10:36] going to be no pretending. I've got a
[2:10:37] quote here I'm going to read as we
[2:10:39] close. I hope it's okay. If you want to
[2:10:41] look it up, brother, I'll tell you what
[2:10:43] message it's in. If if you just search
[2:10:45] up this if you can. Uh uh and about 8 or
[2:10:49] 10 years ago. And about 8 or 10 years
[2:10:52] ago, I think it's really important to
[2:10:55] bring it. It's out of the uncertain
[2:10:56] sound 1960. It's 12:18.
[2:11:01] It's so good. I think it's wonderful to
[2:11:04] just take take a step back and and
[2:11:07] recognize it. You know, we had a prophet
[2:11:08] that came in our day and he had such a
[2:11:10] tremendous faith healing campaign and we
[2:11:13] know that it was the acts of the Holy
[2:11:14] Ghost through the prophet. It wasn't the
[2:11:17] prophet and and his acts, but it was
[2:11:20] actually the Holy Ghost living out
[2:11:22] through him. And and we know we talked
[2:11:23] about it last week that it was the bait
[2:11:26] on the hook to get people to Christ. It
[2:11:28] wasn't to get people to faith healing
[2:11:30] campaigns to get people to just come up
[2:11:32] and get healed because we know people
[2:11:33] came to the stage. They actually stood
[2:11:35] in the presence of the angel of the
[2:11:36] Lord. They actually had their hearts
[2:11:38] discerned. They got healed and then they
[2:11:40] went away and died.
[2:11:43] And I'm saying this, I think it's
[2:11:45] important to recognize they didn't just
[2:11:47] die physically. Amen. Just like the
[2:11:51] fathers in the wilderness,
[2:11:53] they told Jesus, you know, we've got
[2:11:55] Abraham for our father.
[2:11:57] That's our father. Our fathers were with
[2:12:00] Abraham. And he said, "Yeah, they were
[2:12:02] indeed. And they're everyone dead." And
[2:12:05] the prophet in the day in which we live,
[2:12:07] he said, you know, they're not just dead
[2:12:08] laying in the grave waiting for the
[2:12:10] trumpet to sound and the resurrection to
[2:12:12] happen and all of the bodies to come and
[2:12:14] meet the spirits. That's not it. No,
[2:12:16] they died spiritually. Why did they die
[2:12:18] spiritually? because they rejected one
[2:12:20] word for the day in which we lived and
[2:12:22] the day in which they were living. They
[2:12:23] rejected one word. Out of this message
[2:12:26] though, Brother Brand, I'm telling a
[2:12:27] story here. It's just so good. Faith
[2:12:30] healing is is nice, but that follows the
[2:12:33] word every single time. If we try and
[2:12:35] put some sort of faith healing on the
[2:12:37] pedestal in front of us or something
[2:12:39] else, anything but the word of God,
[2:12:41] we're going to get it out of order and
[2:12:42] we're gonna get it wrong. Brother Vanam
[2:12:45] says about 8 or 10 years ago I was
[2:12:47] somewhere in the east here and a woman
[2:12:49] come on a platform to be prayed for. The
[2:12:52] Holy Spirit said you're Mrs. So and so
[2:12:54] and you came from a certain place and we
[2:12:56] know that this was the sign of the end.
[2:13:00] Just like when Elohim came to Abraham on
[2:13:02] the plains of memory. This is exactly
[2:13:05] what he said would happen that the son
[2:13:08] of man would come and discern the hearts
[2:13:10] of the children just like he did back
[2:13:12] there. The Holy Spirit said, "You are
[2:13:15] Mrs. so and so and you came from a
[2:13:17] certain place. You're suffering with so
[2:13:19] and so." Yes, that was all true. They
[2:13:21] said, "Now you've got a friend that
[2:13:23] lives in California."
[2:13:26] This is where it's so beautiful when you
[2:13:27] hear the Holy Ghost, the one that
[2:13:30] searchth the mind and the heart and and
[2:13:32] and just discerns the people. He said
[2:13:34] there said, "Now you've got a friend
[2:13:36] that lives in California. That's a very
[2:13:38] precious friend of yours. And this woman
[2:13:40] is dying with cancer of the kidney. She
[2:13:43] said that is certainly right brother
[2:13:44] Brandham that's Holy Spirit revealing
[2:13:48] the secrets of the heart you see should
[2:13:51] make the American people fall on their
[2:13:53] face and say God
[2:13:56] see it should do it
[2:13:59] oh
[2:14:01] but they are educated heathen
[2:14:04] let's not be educated heathen brothers
[2:14:06] and sisters even in the message of the
[2:14:08] hour we can know all about the message
[2:14:11] but without his spirit I'm saying this.
[2:14:13] I'm going there. We're going to be a
[2:14:15] message heathen. That's right. Outside
[2:14:17] of his spirit quickening this message in
[2:14:19] our hearts because the message is not
[2:14:21] print and books and tapes. The message
[2:14:25] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[2:14:27] today, and forever in the hearts of his
[2:14:29] children.
[2:14:33] The American people should fall on their
[2:14:35] face and say, "God, see, it should do
[2:14:36] it." But but they're educated heathen.
[2:14:39] That's the kind that's hard to deal
[2:14:41] with. See,
[2:14:42] And you know, brother Bradom, he talks
[2:14:43] about these people. They'll listen to
[2:14:45] you long enough just so that they can
[2:14:46] make a solid argument with the quotes
[2:14:48] they've got.
[2:14:50] Quotes against quotes. That's a house
[2:14:52] that's going to fall. Amen.
[2:14:56] See, he's so smart. He knows more than
[2:14:58] God does.
[2:15:01] The people that don't want to do the
[2:15:03] ABCs, they're so smart. They know more
[2:15:06] than God does. So that's the reason he
[2:15:08] hybrids his corn. He he he breeds his
[2:15:11] animals and everything. See what he's
[2:15:12] got himself. Come right back making just
[2:15:14] a simply a well an offreed of himself.
[2:15:17] That's right. By doing so. Remember, you
[2:15:19] can be a denomination of one. I believe
[2:15:21] this way. Therefore, I act the way that
[2:15:23] I do and and and God saved me. Amen. We
[2:15:27] can be a denomination of one. He goes on
[2:15:30] to say, "That's right. By doing so, and
[2:15:32] the breed of the mind of the spirit, he
[2:15:36] just simply gets off on it." Now, we
[2:15:39] noticed that this woman said, "Yes,
[2:15:41] that's right. I do have a friend that's
[2:15:43] in California dying with the cancer of
[2:15:45] the kidney." I said, "Can you imagine
[2:15:47] this, brothers and sisters?" Now, this
[2:15:49] is where it gets so cool, doesn't it?
[2:15:52] Because it wasn't a prophet saying, "I'm
[2:15:54] going to write her a letter."
[2:15:56] This is a 1960 before the seals were
[2:15:58] open. He says, "Yes, that's right. I
[2:16:00] have a friend that's in California dying
[2:16:02] with the cancer of the kidney. I said
[2:16:04] you write and tell her thus saith the
[2:16:08] Lord. You do it.
[2:16:11] She's not going to die but live.
[2:16:15] Now remember
[2:16:17] the story of Esther.
[2:16:20] She had to have the courage to go in and
[2:16:22] see the king.
[2:16:24] But the king never said, "Let me write
[2:16:26] whatever you want, honey. I'll give you
[2:16:28] half of the kingdom. Whatever it is you
[2:16:29] want, I'll just do No, he said, "You do
[2:16:31] it and take my seal and put it on there
[2:16:34] and send it out because whatever you
[2:16:36] say, I say."
[2:16:39] I just think this is amazing here. This
[2:16:40] is something we can just watch over and
[2:16:42] and read it and it'll just go by and
[2:16:44] we'll say, "Yeah, amen. It's wonderful."
[2:16:45] But can we grasp what is happening here?
[2:16:48] You write and tell her, "Thus saith the
[2:16:51] Lord, she's not going to die but live."
[2:16:55] Amen. And that was the lady outside and
[2:16:58] she said that's been about maybe 10 12
[2:17:00] years ago. Remember she was dying with
[2:17:02] cancer the kidney and said I got well
[2:17:04] sound and well there's not a blemish on
[2:17:07] that kidney that she was healed. Amen.
[2:17:10] Said about five years after that. Now
[2:17:13] this is where I think it's incredible
[2:17:14] because just because we're delivered of
[2:17:16] one affliction don't think that the
[2:17:18] storms are over. Don't think that we're
[2:17:19] going to get out of the valley. we could
[2:17:22] walk right into another storm in a
[2:17:24] valley.
[2:17:26] Five years after that,
[2:17:29] I took a tumor and the tumor growed to
[2:17:31] such an excess until it became, I
[2:17:34] believe she said, either 17 or 27 in
[2:17:38] across it. And she was so big that she
[2:17:41] couldn't stand up with this tumor.
[2:17:45] She'd already been delivered, but here
[2:17:46] she goes, another problem coming in her
[2:17:49] life.
[2:17:51] when she tried to stand up, she couldn't
[2:17:52] balance herself. And I just can't help
[2:17:55] but think, you know, this is someone
[2:17:57] that actually had met God. She had
[2:17:59] already seen the healing power of
[2:18:01] almighty God in her life. And I can only
[2:18:03] imagine she was telling her people, "Get
[2:18:05] me to that meeting. I will not be
[2:18:08] denied. Get me to that church. I need to
[2:18:11] be there to see him again." And they
[2:18:14] brought her to this church and set her
[2:18:16] right down right there. And they brought
[2:18:19] her at nighttime after we had the
[2:18:21] healing service that morning. And the
[2:18:23] brethren there told her that we'd not be
[2:18:26] praying for the sick that night. Isn't
[2:18:27] that just right? Nope. Ain't going to
[2:18:29] happen. Just abandon all your hope. All
[2:18:31] of your efforts to get to where you are
[2:18:33] because you think you're going to see
[2:18:34] something the way it's going to be. No,
[2:18:35] it's not going to happen that way. Just
[2:18:37] amazing how it works. And the brethren
[2:18:40] here told her that we would not be
[2:18:42] praying for the sick night because we
[2:18:43] were going to. I had a prayer for the
[2:18:45] sick in the morning and they didn't want
[2:18:46] to put too much burden on me at one
[2:18:48] time. So after the service was over
[2:18:50] after service over I standing taking
[2:18:53] talking to some people and some men got
[2:18:55] a hold of this woman and packed her
[2:18:56] around the house to set her on that step
[2:18:59] as as they went out and she was sitting
[2:19:02] there. The men packed her and brother
[2:19:04] Taylor one of our precious brethren here
[2:19:06] of the church was right there where when
[2:19:09] it happened and I think helped the woman
[2:19:11] get around. are, excuse me, are you
[2:19:14] here, Brother Taylor? Where are you at?
[2:19:17] Brother Taylor says, "Amen." Yeah. Yeah.
[2:19:19] Back in here. He was standing there
[2:19:21] present and helped her get around to the
[2:19:23] back and and the tumor out like this.
[2:19:26] And you could only imagine 27 in my. And
[2:19:30] so we said when I come out the back door
[2:19:33] just gazed down and looked at her and
[2:19:35] said,"Woman, the Lord Jesus that healed
[2:19:39] you of that cancer of the kidney many
[2:19:41] years ago shall also heal you of that
[2:19:44] tumor. Thus saith the Lord,
[2:19:49] never touched or nothing. Didn't lay a
[2:19:51] hand on her." And isn't that the
[2:19:53] commission? The centurion. You know the
[2:19:56] story. Just speak the word.
[2:19:59] That's the anointing we live under,
[2:20:00] brothers and sisters. But it only
[2:20:02] happens with his mind inside of us. It
[2:20:05] only happens when he is making
[2:20:06] intercession inside of us. When he is
[2:20:09] the one saying, "Thus sayaith the Lord."
[2:20:12] When we say, "Thus sayaith the Lord,"
[2:20:14] then the devils are going to laugh at
[2:20:15] us. But when he says, "Thus sayaith the
[2:20:18] Lord," the devils run screaming. Amen.
[2:20:22] I just think this is so beautiful. the
[2:20:24] same one that healed you of that tumor,
[2:20:26] thus sayeth the Lord. Never touched her
[2:20:28] anything. Just walked on out and got in
[2:20:30] the car. And we went away. Just walked
[2:20:33] past her. He said, "Will you come out
[2:20:36] and look at her?" I said, "Yes, sure.
[2:20:38] Tell her to come on in." Said, "No, we
[2:20:40] ain't got time. We just got to go."
[2:20:41] Walked out there and a little woman, she
[2:20:44] jumped out of the car just as flat as I
[2:20:46] am. She had great time. She I think this
[2:20:50] is so beautiful. out there on the road
[2:20:52] running up and down on the road speaking
[2:20:54] in tongues and screaming top of her
[2:20:56] voice in front of the Presbyterian
[2:20:57] parsonage just having a great time. You
[2:21:00] know, brothers and sisters, when God
[2:21:01] really does something for you, it don't
[2:21:03] matter who is around. It don't matter
[2:21:05] where you've been. Don't matter where
[2:21:06] you're going. You're only going to give
[2:21:08] God the glory because you know what he's
[2:21:10] done for you. It hasn't been another
[2:21:12] man. It's not another woman. It's God.
[2:21:14] Amen.
[2:21:17] Now, when some of the neighbors might
[2:21:19] have looked out, thought, well, that
[2:21:21] must be some out of the insane
[2:21:23] institution. Someone done got
[2:21:25] brainwashed, didn't they? Yeah,
[2:21:29] they got brainwashed. I can't help but
[2:21:30] think that. Come up for brother Brandham
[2:21:33] to pray for. That woman wasn't out of an
[2:21:35] insane institution. Her soul was just
[2:21:37] back from glory. See, having a wonderful
[2:21:39] time. She said, "Lookie here." Brother
[2:21:41] Brham opened up her coat just as flat as
[2:21:43] she could be. She said, "Now, for the
[2:21:45] first two or three months after you told
[2:21:47] me that said, I was so bad.
[2:21:51] The first two or three months
[2:21:54] didn't happen. It wasn't instant
[2:21:56] miracle. It's instant gratification.
[2:21:58] Just the way that we're set up in this
[2:21:59] world to be so used to seeing everything
[2:22:01] happening." No, it's God's time.
[2:22:07] The spirit making intercession.
[2:22:12] I think it's so amazing here. The doctor
[2:22:14] said he was going to try. He wasn't
[2:22:16] going to try anymore. If I wouldn't let
[2:22:18] him try, take that tumor out of there.
[2:22:22] How many people have gone down that road
[2:22:24] where they said, "You know what? I'm not
[2:22:25] going to try anymore. I'm not going to
[2:22:26] let you try anymore. It's going to be
[2:22:28] God or it's going to be nothing."
[2:22:32] Wouldn't let them try to take that tumor
[2:22:34] out of there. Said it would weigh
[2:22:36] better. How much did she say around 30
[2:22:39] pounds, brother? Anybody here ever lost
[2:22:41] 30 pounds? I've come close. I've lost
[2:22:44] 20. It actually is amazing.
[2:22:49] But if you just put that weight in a
[2:22:50] backpack, put it on your back. Maybe try
[2:22:52] it today. Get a backpack and throw 30
[2:22:55] lbs in it. That's how much this woman
[2:22:56] was packing around in a tumor.
[2:23:00] They estimated the tumor to weigh at
[2:23:01] about 30 lbs. And said all at once it
[2:23:04] started. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.
[2:23:07] Oh, he keeps his word. That's right. I
[2:23:09] think it's just beautiful. Brothers and
[2:23:10] sisters, he is the same yesterday,
[2:23:12] today, and forever. And he is more than
[2:23:14] able to deliver us out of our in
[2:23:16] afflictions, out of our infirmities. But
[2:23:19] it has to be his spirit. And it has to
[2:23:21] be the true baptism of his spirit. And
[2:23:24] the only way that happens is full
[2:23:26] obedience to what? The complete word of
[2:23:30] God entitles us to the token. Maybe
[2:23:34] stand with me as we close today.
[2:23:36] I just want to read one more scripture
[2:23:38] as we invite the musicians.
[2:23:41] One more scripture for us, brothers and
[2:23:43] sisters, out of Psalms 139.
[2:23:50] Psalms chapter 139 verse one. It says,
[2:23:54] "Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and
[2:23:57] known me.
[2:23:59] Thou knowest my downsitting and mine
[2:24:02] uprising.
[2:24:04] Thou understandest
[2:24:06] my thought a far off.
[2:24:09] Can you imagine that? This is
[2:24:12] interesting to to read this. This is
[2:24:14] David. This isn't just about David,
[2:24:16] though. Remember, put your name in here.
[2:24:19] Amen. Thou knowest my downsitting and my
[2:24:22] uprising. Thou understandest my thought
[2:24:25] a far off. Thou compass me, compass my
[2:24:29] path and my lying down, and are
[2:24:32] acquainted with all of my ways,
[2:24:36] all of my ways.
[2:24:39] For there is not a word in my tongue,
[2:24:42] but lo, oh Lord, thou knowest it all
[2:24:45] together.
[2:24:48] Let's jump down to 17.
[2:24:54] How precious are thy thoughts
[2:24:58] unto me, oh God.
[2:25:00] How great is the sum of them.
[2:25:05] Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, oh
[2:25:08] God. Oh, sorry. Verse 18. If I should
[2:25:12] count them, those thoughts, if I should
[2:25:15] count them, they are more in number than
[2:25:19] the sand.
[2:25:21] When I awake, I am still with thee.
[2:25:25] This is the God we serve.
[2:25:28] God bless you, brothers and sisters.
[2:25:30] Make sure that you get his mind in you.
[2:25:32] And you know what? If you've already got
[2:25:34] his mind in you, just ask him for a
[2:25:36] little bit more. Amen. I think as long
[2:25:38] as we're here, I don't think we could
[2:25:40] ever exhaust the desire for more of him.
[2:25:43] Amen. And if anybody here doesn't have
[2:25:45] that spirit inside of you today, he is
[2:25:49] more than able. Amen. And you know, I'll
[2:25:52] say this because we're having a baptism.
[2:25:54] If anybody else wanted to take water
[2:25:56] baptism today, we have it ready. It's
[2:25:59] good to go. He is more than able to give
[2:26:02] you of his spirit.
[2:26:04] Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:26:08] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[2:26:09] you for your word. Thank you Lord Jesus
[2:26:12] that you have given us of your spirit
[2:26:15] that you came Lord Jesus. You descended.
[2:26:18] You condescended yourself. You set your
[2:26:21] crown and your robe down. You set your
[2:26:25] glory aside, Father. And you you left
[2:26:27] your throne. You left your dominion in
[2:26:29] heaven. And you came to earth born in a
[2:26:33] filthy stable with animals,
[2:26:36] with human beings. Lord,
[2:26:39] you came so that you could die.
[2:26:43] So that you could take that spirit out
[2:26:45] of that man and give it back to your
[2:26:48] children. We're so thankful, Lord Jesus,
[2:26:51] that you did that because we are willing
[2:26:54] recipients of your spirit here today.
[2:26:58] And Father, we're so thankful that we
[2:26:59] can be filled with your spirit.
[2:27:02] We're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that you
[2:27:04] sent us a prophet to call us back to
[2:27:06] your spirit. Lord, outside of a prophet
[2:27:09] in the age in which we live, we would
[2:27:11] likely be baptized in the name of the
[2:27:13] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[2:27:15] Ghost and truly not be able to partake
[2:27:18] of your mind being in us. But, Father,
[2:27:21] we're so thankful that you gave us ears
[2:27:23] to hear what your spirit said to this
[2:27:25] church. And Father, you have called out
[2:27:27] a bride of your own choosing that you
[2:27:30] created in you before the foundation of
[2:27:32] the world to be the willing bride to be
[2:27:35] taken out of Satan's Eden. We know that
[2:27:37] once upon a time, Satan came and took a
[2:27:40] bride out of the Garden of Eden that you
[2:27:42] made, Lord.
[2:27:44] But you have created a bride to be taken
[2:27:46] out of Satan's Eden. And Father, that is
[2:27:48] us. We can see our identity there. And
[2:27:50] we thank you for it, Lord.
[2:27:53] Now we just say, "Be it unto us
[2:27:54] according to your word." We're so
[2:27:56] thankful, Father, for your goodness and
[2:27:58] your tender mercies, Lord. Father, we
[2:28:00] just pray that you would be around each
[2:28:02] and every one of us. That you would
[2:28:03] compass our paths, Lord. That you would
[2:28:06] help us to remember that you know our
[2:28:08] comingings and our goings. You know our
[2:28:10] uprisings and our downgoings, Father.
[2:28:12] You know when we're awake and when we're
[2:28:14] asleep, and you are more than able to
[2:28:16] make every single provision for us in
[2:28:19] our lives that we require. Help us, Lord
[2:28:21] Jesus, to open that free will gate to
[2:28:24] you, Lord. Help us to push aside all of
[2:28:26] our our Christianity and our
[2:28:28] churchianity and just Lord Jesus, allow
[2:28:31] you to manifest the way that you desire
[2:28:33] in each and every one of our lives. And
[2:28:36] Father, the lives that we live will bear
[2:28:38] record of that submission to you.
[2:28:40] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[2:28:42] just want to commit each life into your
[2:28:44] hands now as we go our separate ways for
[2:28:47] your glory. We ask all these things in
[2:28:50] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
