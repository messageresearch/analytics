man and amen God bless you this morning you love the Lord amen we want to look in the scripture The Book of Job the 42nd chapter job the 42nd chapter we want to hear this morning to read there and also we're going to turn in the New Testament to First John chapter 1 first John chapter one brother Barry I don't know if it'd be possible maybe to get a couple batteries just don't stand by I know you mentioned this thing going dead and me and them chords don't get along too well I was preaching one time and the whole time I was preaching I was wrapping my foot in that chord brother Paul and a few minutes later I about tripped over in front of everybody amen so but job the 42nd chapter in the first verse and we're going to share a few things with you here on our heart and try not to hold you all day amen we don't want to we don't want to be a favor yeah [Music] hey man you love the Lord this morning amen job 42 verse 1. the Bible says here then job answered the Lord and said I love his authority here I know he's not saying I guess I know that thou canest do everything and that no fault can be withholding from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge now listen therefore have I uttered that I understood not thanks to wonderful wonderful for me which I knew not I loved how brother Barry said that you just say Amen even if you don't understand it right job utter things that I understood not and I'll notice here in verse 4 here I beseech thee and I will speak and I will demand of thee declare thou unto me so here's a man job looking at God and saying declare yourself to me in verse 5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now might I seethy I have heard of thee of the hearing of the year but now my eyes seetham said what was he seen in his word Vindicated amen he was seen in his word Vindicated now in the book of First John the first chapter uh very very familiar reading to you here first John chapter 1 and we want to look there in the first verse I've actually been studying pretty heavy on first John 1 and just a few things I'd like to bring to you this morning from that I think it's a powerful reading how John there is describing the person of Christ and he says in the first verse that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the lives somebody say the life the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you now watch in job 42 he's telling God declare yourself to me and now in first John actually you're actually declaring back to God see I have seen heard and declared we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full now I love this verse this then is the message this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this after this morning rather from those passages of scripture for just a few moments I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you here and on this thought I want to speak to you on hearing seeing and declaring the message hearing seeing and declaring the message you know I love there that word that John uses in verse 5 he says this then is the message and I I'll go on record this morning and say we believe the message amen this then is the message now that word message there means an announcement it is a promise it is the act of promising it is a promise given or to be given it's a promised good or blessing so in other words we could say this then is the promise this then is the blessing this then is the announcement amen that God is light now brother remember says here in recognize hearing recognizing acting on the word 1960 he said first Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God then the believer hears it recognizes it and acts on it believer hears it recognizes it and acts on it he said the carnal man will hear it the sound of it amen but never see hear means to understand it now look at it is looking at something amen but to see it is to understand it so you can look at something but if you don't see it you didn't really look at it amen or you didn't really see it because when you see it then you understand it see brother Brown said now he goes back to John 3 where Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God remember they were looking for the kingdom of God they said oh where is the kingdom of God he said the kingdom of God is within man now again I have heard but now I see but remember said and the church has heard of God they have read of him and what he did and the promise he made amen but now we see him with our eyes amen we've heard of him we've read about him amen but now we see him with our eyes just the same as job did I have heard of thee amen but now I see thee we see him so in other words we could say now we understand him that's the beautiful thing about this message is we're not just hearing about God we're not just looking at God but we're actually understanding God see amen the Bible said amen that we would have eyes to see we would have ears to hear we would have a heart he meant to receive now in other words amen we're not just looking at him but we see him and we understand him I love what brother Brown says he said in the Paradox 65 he says now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because it'll come and Ephesian to it so when we come to this time we're not coming back amen God bless you brother Matthew we're not coming back Amen to another Corinthians we're not coming back to another a Pentecostal age but we're actually coming into an understanding now amen I said like this I believe we have seen the message how many here can raise your hand and say we've seen the message amen I believe that we've heard the message we can agree we've heard it amen but I believe that time has come to declare the message amen amen not just to see it not just to look at it not just to hear it amen but the time has come to declare it now Isaiah 48 verse 6 it said that I was heard amen see all this and will not ye declare it so here he's asking you a question you've heard these things you're seeing these things amen then why will you not declare it see I have showed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them amen in first John 1 3 he said this which we have seen that word see means to see with the Mind amen this word gives prominence to the Discerning mind so amen we have discerned we have we have perceived amen and heard that word heard amen means not to be death it means to proceed by the ear amen what is announced in one's presence so then what is the message amen the message is the announcement amen so when the announcement is made if you hear it amen you will actually give your ear Amen to announce or to declare what is in your presence see amen that word here means to learn to give over your ear to a teaching amen or a teacher John said we have seen and we heard now listen this word and we declare unto you that word declare amen means to bring Tidings from a person it means to bring a word to report Amen to Proclaim to make known openly amen amen let me preach this morning to you amen you are not the people of a close book you are not a church a meant of a close book you're actually a people of an open book amen then what has been done has been opened amen and God did not open the word for us to fuss about it he did not open the word for us to argue about it amen but he opened the word amen so that the things that have been hid from the foundation of the world would be made known in this generation amen but here's the beautiful thing about it amen he waited till there were eyes to see it amen he waited till there were ears to hear it he waited till there was somebody on the earth that when they heard it and they seen it they would not look at it and walk away amen but they would give their ear to it they would give their life to it and they would begin to declare amen the thing that they have seen and the thing that they have heard amen then these things we write unto you amen that's your joy might be full amen this then is the message which we ever heard of him and declare unto you amen I 11 Acts 20 verse 27 Paul they're writing he said I have not shunned Amen to declare unto you all the counsel of God in job 42 he said declare unto me amen your counsel and Paul writes and says I have not shunned a mentor declare unto you the whole counsel of God now when you look at this word son I'm just laying a foundation if that's okay when you look at this word shunned it means to draw back it means to let down it means to lower it means to withdraw of a timid person Amen to withdraw oneself Amen to be timid to cover Amen to shirk amen of those who from Timothy amen hesitate to avow what they believe amen of those of Timothy amen hesitate to avow what they believe Amen to be unwilling to utter from Fear Amen to shrink from declaring Amen to conceal and to disassemble amen now listen Paul here is telling you amen when you see the counsel of God when you hear the counsel of God that's not the time to become afraid that's not the time to pull back amen and say well I don't know I'm not sure amen but that is the time Amen to declare what you have seen and what you've heard I'm just going to preach amen because I think it's time we start declaring this message we've declared enough negativity we've declared enough this that and the other amen I think it's time somebody amen declare this message as the absolute they've been declared as the God Amen declared as Rapture in faith listen Church there's nothing else worth talking about and then there's nothing else worth singing about there's nothing else worth preaching about this message is the word of God and it should be declared now when somebody's son something they're only doing it because of fear and you all know that brother Brandon said amen that fear is one of the greatest things that Satan amen has put on the church amen is the spirit of fear but I want to say this this morning I rebuke the spirit of fear amen I rebuke the spirit of fear amen I rebuke the spirit of Timothy I rebuke the spirit of cowardism Amen this is not the hour to be a coward with this message this is not the hour to be a fearful Christian this is the hour to be a perseverant believer this is the hour to be a determined believer this is the hour to persevere this is the hour to endure this is the hour to say what a prophet said regardless of what devil don't like it say it anyhow it's the hour to declare the counsel of God Amen brother Ben said someday I want to stand by him and him say Well done my good and faithful servant faithful you stood at the post of Duty you did not shirk it amen you told the truth amen regardless of what it took you told the truth he said and it's well done now I love this he said that's what I'm looking for not for a better car not for a better position I want him amen everyone says anything about you that doesn't matter I want him listen if you're going to declare this message amen sometimes you're going to have to do it in the face of criticism amen if you're going to declare what God has done in your generation sometimes you're going to have to walk through the Hall of critics Amen to declare what God has done in the age you're living in amen but I want to tell that therefore he don't have enough criticism Amen to cause this bride Amen to shun from declaring the whole counsel of God listen you can talk about us you can write about us you can post about us you can plaster Us on YouTube you can plaster us on social media amen but there's not enough pressure he been to turn this right around amen from declaring Malachi 4 is fulfilled Revelation 10 is fulfilled Luke school come on Church wake up and preach Luke 17 30 is fulfilled this is not the hour to let criticism silence her voice this is not the hour to let criticism back Us in the corner offer the promises of God these are our promises this is our message this is our deliverance this is our Revelation this is the time to declare it now I've met people they say oh I see it brother I believe the message Man the message is the truth and you know what sometimes I wonder if they really believe it because there's some people you talk to them all day and don't know what they believe come on you know I'm telling the truth amen you talk to him all day and don't have a clue if they believe but if you really believe this message you say well I'm not a preacher so I don't have a Pulpit to declare it from actually you are a preacher you actually are a preacher the sermon you're preaching is your life see you might not have a microphone Amen to declare this message but you have a life and John said it's the same life that was manifested in the sun is now manifested in the bride amen and it's an absolute life come on Church why are you all still here this morning amen you're not here by just the Natural Life of your father and your mother which came together to produce a child amen you are here because there's an absolute life there's a there's an unlimited life amen there's a stability life amen there's a Vindicated life it's the life of Jesus Christ only inside of the believer amen when that life comes in amen it stirs something up on me inside of you and you can't sit still amenities there's something on the inside of you and you gotta go tell somebody amen when you've seen something and you've heard something you got to go tell somebody now amen I can take you to the Bible it's John the first chapter when the Bible says that Philip amen come to Nathanael and he actually saw the manifestation of the Messiah sign the product God says it's beautiful he said when Nathanael he said he said Philip saw it he went to Nathaniel's house he said he wanted to tell him that what we're looking for has been found he's sitting out he went up there and he went to the door and knocked on the door and Nathaniel's wife said he's out in the garden praying he said that wasn't enough to stop Philip amen he ran through the garden and he found Nathanael praying he said he was a gentleman he said he waited till he finished praying he said then he looked at him and he said this to overcome he said I can see Philip standing there amen say oh why don't we hurry up amen I just can't wait to tell him of something that's the way the church to be that's the way the church ought to be right now amen today we shirk back amen it's the preacher's job it's this person's job it's your job Amen to declare this message amen the prophet of God said God forbid amen that I ever shirt from this child he said everything is a responsibility he said it's easy when the responsibilities face us Amen to shirt back from them we find out that marriage is a responsibility he said now this is hard to say but it's true amen that ministers many times Circle responsibility for standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with him amen they'll shirk that responsibility when the truth of the word of God is brought face to face with the human being we are prone Amen to shirt back until the last resource Amen Let Me rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ it is not the time Amen to back up it's the time to go forward it's not the time he meant to look to the left or to look to the right it's the time to pursue amen and take back everything that the devil has told from the church I know what I'm talking about amen go through a prayer line on Sunday morning and let and let let hands be laid on you and you believe that God healed you and wake up on Monday morning and the symptom is there you know what will happen a spirit of Timothy will set in and a fear amen not to a vow that you believe you are healed amen but when this symptom raises its head that's the time to testify hey come on church when the storm clouds gather that's not the time to tuck tell and run that's the time to stand there amen come on how you gonna whip that devil we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony and Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of God this morning and he is the high priest amen of our confession I rebuke that devil it says we ain't got a right to confess if anybody got a right to confess it's the Bride of Jesus Christ if anybody got a right to use their voice to declare what they seen and they've heard come on church I tell you what will happen you'll declare it long enough till your body will obey it come on Amen you will declare it long enough until your body will have to obey your confession somebody said well confessions line confessions not lying confession is confessing foreign now you know I'm telling you the truth sometimes you gotta whip that devil just by confessing the word of God because he can only go into action based upon your confession now I mean I love how program says this he said now I stand Here declaring the creator of the heavens and earth Jehovah God he said now I claim to be a representative of his in these last days to bring Faith to his church he meant he was standing there declaring himself as a representative amen of Jehovah God Amen and to bring a faith in the church now how many knows the Bible said that surely the Lord God will do nothing except first he revealed of his Secrets unto His prophets and I know a lot of guys got new can I preach amen I know guys get New Revelations and they amen you know they want you to they want you to join in with them amen but here's the problem if a prophet didn't declare it then I have nothing to stand upon to declare it amen but if a prophet declared it then I can stand in the face of every agnostic I can stand in the face of every intellectual I can stand in the face of every doubting spirit and declare thus saith the Lord because a prophet has said amen what God has revealed in the age I'm living come on friends I know people say well amen we need to prophesy amen we need to prophesy and I agree amen anybody here want to prophesy three of you amen anybody here want to prophesy it's not a trick question you want to prophesy amen what can I tell you something I know this is on the internet okay can I tell you something this morning I'm going to teach you how to prophesy are you ready brother Paul will teach you how to prophesy you say Oh Brother Andy you're going far out there how are you going to do that are you ready for it I want you to go home and I want you to listen to a tape and then I want you to go tell somebody what you heard [Applause] you say that's not prophesied yes it is because the Bible said that thou amen must prophesy again if you're prophesying again then you're not saying something new you're saying what's already been said and the Bible said in revelation 22 17 that the spirit and the bride say come and a prophet said in the last days he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will be all saying the same thing they will be declaring that God is not dead he is alive they will be declaring this a Rapture is upon the church because the spirit said it the prophet declared it the bride received it and now she is declaring the Vindicated word of her hour let me say this plane as I know how God's provided channel to declare his word Secrets is by Prophet now notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way and he chose the way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being part of God's word amen declaring the Revelation are you hearing me so a prophet is declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time now watch of indicated Prophet amen I love this quote he said in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God whoa brother that's a shouting quote right there in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in this building under my control to declare the word of God what is the word of God it's Hebrews 4 it's a sword of the Lord and it's a two-itched sword and it's more sharper and more powerful in any sword and it'll cut the devil coming and it'll cut the devil going listen friends it's time to quit sitting there like a bunch of helpless hopeless church members and realize who you are and you got a sword and it's a king sword it's a sword it'll cut every devil and bring a liberty in the house of God you say brother I don't know amen I'm not ashamed to declare the king's sword it's not in the grave in Jeffersonville the king's sword is not still in the mountains of Arizona but right here in Living Word assembly the king's sword is in the hand of every believer who's got an arm of Faith to pick it up and fight back against that devil listen amen you may think I'm crazy but I'm following God it's time to declare war it's time to declare war them Devils have come in and they've eaten away eat away eat away it's time to stand up and declare war on them devils come on Church how long are you going to sit there they've already taken your joy they've already taken your peace now they're trying to take your amen they're trying to take her Hallelujah come on shamgar get some grit about you [Applause] [Music] some great about you shamgar and fight back against these devils now listen I realize where I'm at I'm in spiritual warfare this morning and you're looking at one preacher that will not back up and I will not shun to declare this message and I know we're living a day and time where there's a lot of different directions there we've got to go this way go that way go this way amen but I'm going to tell you what a prophet said he said I believe amen that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever can I tell you what else he said he said I believe that he's here amen the same as he was then except in a corporate body than if he is here all of his power is here all of his authority is here all of this anointing is here listen friends we're not a bunch of message people it's just buried in some Corner following some story this is the war but the battle's home come on shamgar are you going to sit there until the devil takes everything from you now listen you may not like me but that's okay I'll preach anyhow cause I love you are you going to sit there and let the devil pack everything out of the house of God it's time to get some more in you if you went home the day walked in your house and that uh uh let's see amen you walked in your house and there's your big oh there's your big old boat you know it's in your garage man you worked hard for it you paid for it amen you amen you finally got it paid for amen you got all this there amen and you go in and some old guy sitting up on your boat and he's hooking his truck up to it and he's pulling it out of your garage are you going to walk in and say well how are you today you know uh have a good time the keys are under the seat there's some fishing rods in the back there's some bait over there in the you ain't gonna lay down and let some thief take your boat out of your house you know what you'll do you'll fight for it you know you know why you'll fight for it because it has value to you it means something to you now I'm on preacher for a second amen because you would fight over a boat but you won't fight over the joy of God you won't fight over the devil taking your kids you won't fight over the devil trying to take the liberty and the moving of the spirit out of the church you know what I say I say your heart is in the wrong place if you'll fight for a boat and not this word something wrong with you I say oh God this morning give us a fight amen that when we see the devil who is a thief trying to come in and steal and kill and destroy we will rise up like Mighty Gentile Warriors and we will declare war on that devil and say Satan you've gone as far as you're going to go you've gone as far as you're going to go amen the hour has come to declare this message and when you declare this message get ready Wars on its way when you declare this message as the absolute you get ready every gun and hell is going to be turned towards you he said when you see this message is Christ himself amen the gospel the message is when you want see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that everything else is gone the rest of us just feel or see when you want oh God when you once see the message and what are you saying preacher I'm saying that the need of the hour is an experience with the person of the message you say who is the person of the message now don't get mad at me amen but there's no preacher in the message that is the person of the message the person of the message is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself listen the part of God said what we need is a face-to-face contact what we need is a face to face contact are you hearing me can I borrow your brother Isaac can you come here for a second what we need is a face to face contact amen now if you'll stand here and face that wall okay brother Isaac is here right we see him he's in the building he's right here so I'm standing here and I say brother Isaac how are you are you doing good uh uh what what's your name where do you go to where do you go to school what is your answer amen I'm talking to him I see him but I really don't see him there is no communication there is no Fellowship I'm doing all the talking I'm facing him but he's not facing me but if brother Isaac turns around and he looks at me I say my name is Andrew my name is Isaac we shake hands we have Fellowship we come into contact and there's a communion thank you buddy there's a communion listen friends do you see what this message is this message is not you looking at God and him having his back to you amen but this message is another river of Jordan experience where the word has come face to face with a word listen friends through this message you can shake his hand through this message you can hug his neck through this message you can kiss his feet through this message you can feel every Divine virtue amen flowing through your body through this message we have come into contact with the Living God and we know him we know him in the power of his resurrection then because we know him we can have fellowship with him oh you know if that Word Fellowship is that word Fellowship is exhibiting an embodiment and proof of Fellowship when you are fellowshipping with something you are you are an embodiment oh God you are the literal embodiment of what you're fellowshipping with I love what the prophet of God says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you as a little boy or a little girl you would walk around there would be certain things it would just well where it wouldn't bother other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was a god somewhere see yet you were a sinner you remember that amen now what was that that was that little form of life that was in you then I'm on Church you did not receive that Effie altar you did not receive that seed when you heard the first tape that seed was in you always come on that seed was in you always but until that seed was quickened you were you come on amen God was looking at you but you had your back to him amen you were fellowshipping with drugs you were fellowship with alcohol you were fellowshipping with the nomination you had your back to him but my Bible says to Romans 8 11 if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he shall Quicken your mortal body do you see what that quickening power is it was the quickening of the form of life on the inside of you oh God Brother Don and when that seed was quickened it literally turned you from having your back to God to face to face with God Hallelujah it turns you from having your back come on church he was trawling at you he was wooing at you he was talking to you but just like I was talking to Isaac when he had his back to me there was no Fellowship there was no communication but when he turned around and he looked at me face to face foreign I wish I was a preacher right now when he looked at me face to face he then began to have Fellowship come on church and you're looking at God through this message face to face he said then one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always you want to declare war on that emotional devil go ahead and do it right now the seed was in you always so you know what I say Amen you know what I can say brother Paul on my best day I'm a child of God and on my worst day I'm a Child of God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Child of God when I'm in this island I'm a Child of God when I'm well I'm a Child of God when I'm sick I'm a Child of God my child ship does not depend on the condition of my life it depends on the seed that's in my soul and I come from God I gotta go back to God Hallelujah I think it's time somebody amen right here in the house of God on a Sunday morning declare who you are you're not serpent seeds you're not a child of the devil you didn't come from hell so you can't go back to hell you came from God and you got to go back to God it's time to declare who you are where you come from and where you're going it's time to declare it come on I know when you make a mistake the devil wants you to shine to declare the whole counsel of God you're not a child that's the time to declare it I feel good I feel good this morning I've been claimed as a child of God brother I have been claimed as a son of the most high God I have been Justified I have been Sanctified I have been filled with a holy ghost the seed in my soul is quickened I'm not headed to tribulation I'm not headed to the battles of the end time I am headed for the rapture somebody declare it somebody declare it somebody declare we're going in the rapture Hallelujah somebody declare that some morning between six and nine loved ones are going to appear well brother that devil told me I'm gonna miss a Rapture can I tell you what that devil is he's a liar that devil is a liar and you know what somebody ought to declares this morning so since I got the microphone I'm going to the devil's a liar [Music] some of y'all need to declare it the devil's a liar he's lying to you Soldier Boy he's lying to your Soldier Boy you're not going to commit suicide forgot you're not gonna commit suicide you're gonna go home and you're going to be a real man no one understood come on Church no one understood why a prophet said you're going to go home and be a real man so brother bisco told the rest of the testimony and said when we left the meeting went in a restaurant and the doctor brought the Soulja Boy in there and his background was he had gotten involved in homosexuality and the devil lied to him and said he was going to be a homosexual and he was in a mental hospital and the man walked in the in the meeting the prophet of God discerned him he was delivered but he come in the restaurant and he said can I have a minute with you brother Branham and brother bisco said I watched them as they walk down that sidewalk he said he got about halfway and he started popping his fist saying I'm free I'm free I'm free I'm free robesco said when brother bam got back he said Eddie he said what happened is that boy is involved in homosexuality and the devil was lying to him and he he was going to commit suicide he said but the minute that thing was exposed was the men that he was free foreign church I'm preaching to you this morning and the word still exposes the devil and the church age book said the devil hates to be exposed you know what you you know what you're doing right now amen some of y'all sitting here and the devil's already been exposed and he's telling you you're not going to get free but will you receive a declaration from a word Prophet when the devil is exposed he has lost brother Gilbert his power over your life and you're automatically free well you know what I say pornography is defeated adultery is defeated fornication is defeated drunken lying and cheating and stealing and narcotics prescription abuse is defeated in the name of Jesus Christ depression is defeated anxiety is defeated complexes is defeated your past is defeated and the Holy Ghost is here to declare unto you who the son has made free is free indeed Satan in the name of Jesus I adore thee by the power of the Living God come away from the people and let her faith recognize who they are and declare with a word somebody shout hallelujah somebody giving me some praise somebody give him some worship who the son I set free it's free you're free you're free I know why that devil didn't want us to me to say that because you know what he said he said I already got you what that devil says he says I already got you but you know what when I was in my immaturity he could Bluff me out by that but one day I heard a prophet say take your hands off Satan take your hands off God's Property sis you know what I never heard him say I never heard him say Satan take your hands off and let them become God's Property you always were sister Shelley you always were God's Property so you know what happened God sent a prophet to declare to the devil Who You Are and take your hands off my kids are you hearing me I know there's a lot of things trying to claim our young people but I want to tell that devil you're too late devil you're too late brother I remember when that devil used to tell me I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you and I would get scared and I would chirp back a little bit and I would probably shine to declare what I should have declared and said maybe that Devil's going to get me but you know what brother Barry one day I got to thinking about that amen I give my heart to God when I was a nine-year-old boy was baptized to receive the holy ghost at 12 years old I've been preaching this message since I was 13 years old amen and the devil's told me over and over and over I'm gonna get you you know when I come to realization one day if that devil was going to get me he would have done got me well let me shout a little bit on that if that devil was going to get me he would have done got me but the reason he ain't got me is because he don't have the ability to get me the devil does not have the ability to claim your life he cannot claim your flesh he come on church he cannot claim your testimony the message of the hour has already claimed you [Applause] you didn't claim this message this message claimed you this then is the message this then is the announcement that God has given this age laodicea according to Malachi 4 a message and that message is a claiming message can I preach it to you brother Isaac you didn't claim the message the message claims you are you hearing me Church you did not claim this message this message claimed you do you know why it claims you for its fulfillment it's in your tape proving his word there is going to be a Rapture there is going to be a resurrection there is going to be a millennium there will be a new heavens and a new Earth and only the righteous will be there those who's been made a part of his word in the age they're living in listen friends God is going to fulfill first Thessalonians 4 and he's not going to hold God he's not going to raise up Seven Ages to do it the Bible said some are going to go by the way of the grave but some are going to be alive and they're going to remain as the coming of the Lord and you which are alive and remain are the claimed property of almighty God to fulfill the translation through your flesh come on Enoch it's time to walk come on Enoch it's time to go home oh God Enoch Enoch didn't bet God to be a type God claimed he not to be a top that's a powerful point right there Enoch didn't pay his way into being a tie for the bride God claimed him it's all for your message God claimed him because in the end time in the end of seven watches the seven from Adam the seventh Church age will take the Rapture and there had to be a top to do it by so God claimed Enoch but a translation message uh what are you saying I'm saying the message we're following is a scriptural message Mercy brother brother bear you weren't lying I'm trying to I'm trying to hurry but there's a pool in here amen amen but then but listen but when God is in it a message is going to follow that sign and that message must be from the scripture say this with me this then is the message and that message must be from the scripture so it must be a scriptural message it must come thus saith the Lord can I tell you from the messenger what the message is can I can I take a few minutes and tell you from the messenger what the message is the program says in 1953 the message is ready the power of God is sufficient the message is ready the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared Amen to break out yonder into those fears before God and dare to trust him and take his word I love this one and the message he is the holy spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you 1957 and now the message is to the people that he is already did the blessing for you the message is a message of a scriptural promise of the day at Calvary when he cried these words it is finished the whole God then you are the recipient of a finished work now listen the message is the blessings done for you and it's for you to receive it that's what this right age is that's why the seed had to come out of the sunk Amen to lay in the presence of the sun is to receive what is already been provided can I read you another one the message is to God's children it's not to any certain organization but two God's children can I reach another one the message is to the believer to them that perish its foolishness but to them that are in Christ and a part of that seed it's life can I give you another one the message is urgent the message is urgent he said don't stop you keep going just keep moving we haven't got time for socials and parties and picnics amen the message is urgent can I give you another one the message he said is on my heart I must get it out that's my sole purpose regardless of what my

live is not the life that came from my father and came from my mother the life I now live is the life he lived he lives in us today oh God can I can I have a few more minutes can I give you another one are you ready the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is of what he is Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same works that he did manifest himself through you the very same things he did it's the evening light what are you saying preacher can I say this the message is the Revival of the Supreme deity of God in the church amen buddy it's the Revival of the Supreme deity of God in the church what do you say can you say it with me Supreme deity Supreme deity Supreme not Superior not inferior Supreme deity said oh how I like to preach how I like to preach the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ which was Jehovah God manifested in flesh come on church when you see Jesus you had heard about the word you had read about the word but when you saw Jesus when Thomas touched his side he was handling the word can I just go and bring it on home when people shake your hands they're not shaking hands with just a citizen they're not just shaking hands with a co-worker they are handling they are handling the word of life somebody say Supreme deity Supreme deity you know what but then a fast can I kind of go on you know what he identifies Supreme deity as Revelation 1 8 I am the alpha and the Omega brother Matthew the beginning and the end saith who the Lord are you ready for this which he is which was and which is to come the Almighty all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he kinos he emptied he poured into the church foreign [Applause] into the church are you hearing me listen no other Prophet can stand and say Elohim is back again Jehovah Jireh is here El shadiah is here okay Melchizedek come on come on y'all are well taught brother brother Brian did not title 1965 who is Melchizedek who is this Melchizedek not who was Melchizedek who will be Melchizedek who is this Melchizedek he preaches the Mighty God unveiled which could very easily be titled the mighty bride of God unveiled come on Christ is the mystery of God revealed where is he revealing his mystery the greatest of all the revelations is this the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ then brother Mary what was in the beginning will be in the end what was in the alpha will be in the Omega do you know why I can declare to you this morning this word because the god that is in your future back up the God that's in your present has already been in your future come on Church he's already being in your future the first of all the revelations he is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you must know who he is when you hear his voice Revelation 3 8 the Philadelphian Church age I know that works and behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast the little strength has kept my word and has not denied my name now watch this an Open Door program says what is it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ not somebody say not not being a second person of a trinity but being God himself made flesh and dwelling among us another place if you want to see the Revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is oh God I don't have time to preach that quote the only way he can Rapture his church is to take him back to the revelation of what he is what did he preach in the Rapture he said the Rapture is a revelation and the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture but a few pages over he says and here is the revelation of the Rapture it's first Thessalonians 4 it's a shout it's a voice and it's a trumpet what is the shout it's the message of Malachi 4. it's the bread of the presence of God to call the bride out together them I'm on Church y'all remember in school I know I know uh I know we're getting ready to start back to school maybe a sore subject for some but y'all remember in school you went to school I graduated because of open book tests thank God for open book test it's

door he did not beg them to come they fell into position and when the head moved foreign ER moved they just moved with him thank you guys thank you all are you hearing me what is this message it's the headship of Jesus Christ Gathering the bride together for the going home come on Church don't get out of line get in Step get back in Step we're going home Church we're going home get behind this message follow this message where he goes you go with it what are you saying the move is on for the bride the move is home for the bride when Isaac moved they followed and where the pillar of fire goes where the pillar fire goes this bride will follow what are you saying I'm saying I gotta close for one but I'm gonna say this there's nobody could ever stop that message somebody say ever stop that message of supreme deity the gates of hell will never Prevail against it the gates of hell will never Prevail against it they may come against it but they will never prevail it's an open door now y'all ever heard that song down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came listen I got to quit singing Everybody I'll leave Jesus was his name and said I love that song oh god listen you can't make this stuff up brother Paul he said I love this song because it expresses the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ and what is the first word in that song down down from his glory come on church can I say this to you he came down do you know why he came down because we were down [Applause] he came down because we were down listen he was already up we could not get to where he was so he came down and I saw another Mighty Angel come down give me that first picture do you see this that that first picture there it is do you see this a Mystic Cloud comes down and appears over the mountain can I read this to you I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the pillars of fire her son the fetus pillars of fire now watch this this clown appears listen science takes the picture right now listen I know the devil hates this but guess what I'm not a chicken I'm a preacher I'm not ashamed of this picture you know why you're you say preacher be careful you know why some people are ashamed of this you know why it's cause they got a devil on them well don't say it I'll say it again it's a devil well you don't want me to preach don't push against me it's a devil it's a devil to cause you to shine to declare that Supreme deity has returned in this age to gather the bride under the headship somebody told me that long ago oh we're just getting to know each other so y'all gonna know what I believe I believe the message somebody told me on go hey summer Lander when you're witnessing about the cloud they said we got somebody and he's working with a scientist and they're researching the cloud and they're getting all these scientific points together so we can we can really represent the cloud he said when you is this okay brother Barry there's a there's a spirit don't like it but I but I'll preach over that devil because it ain't the first time I met him as a scientific research and we're gonna we're gonna present the cloud scientifically brother possibly said he said when you witness the cloud how do you witness it I said oh very easy what program said that's our Lord up there see I'm just dumb enough to say what a prophet's saying that's her Lord Affair he said oh no no brother he said you got you got to be able to present it in the right way I said well how else can we present it then say what a prophet's saying it's our Lord up there you know why they need more evidence of it because they're not under the headship of it they're still questioning the authority of the headship of the Bride of Jesus Christ but let me put my voice on record and say this I love every one of my ministering Brothers I pray God bless them and use them but no preacher in this message is the headship to this bride I'm not brother Barry snot brother Tim Pruitt's not brother Wayne's not brother Sean's not Brother Don he's not no other preacher in this message is the headship of this message that right there is our headship thank you brother they saw it brother Don I'm closing they saw it they took the picture of it but they could not understand it go leave that picture there so they take it to science and they look at it and when they bring it brings it the Tabernacle in 1965. he says now some of you all have been looking at this he said this this Cloud he said now he met me the other day and he said this he said turn it to the right and go listen to the rise of the Sun and there's an audible gasp there's an audible gasp comes over the congregation do you know why because in 1963 he said when the life reaches the body when the body recognizes the life that's in the headship is now in the body it's the time for the rapture come on Church you know what I want to do this morning I want to declare to you it's time to go home our God is here Hallelujah a ride is here I can't preach Restless to you I just gotta close can I say this to you how many wants to go to heaven how many wants to go to the marriage supper of the Lamb how many wants to go to the Future home how many wants to go to Glory you know what you got to have a ride to get there this is your ride this is your Uber this is your Uber this is your lift this is your lift Hallelujah I'm going to preach it you're going to believe it and some morning between six and nine Supreme deity is going to lift us out of time into eternity this is the message I declare to you headship has come it's here where is it don't say it I'll say it this day this scripture is fulfilled [Applause] I will not defy that unbelieving devil this is my headship are you hearing me it's the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ now oh God let me let me close on this point this message is our leadership this message is our leadership now if you still if you still question it well let me just go ahead and say it to you again brother when he said that he said my home has not been without one since since he caught the revelation he said my home the picture he said why because the message is he goes before us he's not in a tune behind us he's before us making a way what are you saying preacher how many can say the message the message can I can I say to you like this and I I wanna I'm slowing down here because I want to lay this in the message is God pouring his own life into you foreign you say preacher how can you prove this Blasphemous names he said in this church age the message is being poured into the church listen individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost not the church in a body a group listen the man can I can I can I preach you the last few minutes from a from a from a burning burden on my heart the man who was pouring the water he says the messenger to the church he said pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing it was bullying all the trash out the pouring of the message in the church is the fire of the Holy Ghost to Bull the trash out of the church you say can you prove this scripturally y'all remember Luke 24 when Jesus walked on the Emmaus Road and they said why they said why he said why are you so sad they said have you not heard him said they were full of sadness they were full of doubts they were full of fears listen what a prophet said he said and Jesus never started arguing with him can I say this to you this message is not an argument now I'm preaching to you from a burning burden on my heart right now this message is not an argument he started talking with him now watch what he did he went straight to the word he said you're all confused and one says this I'm sorry y'all forgive me I got to this point way too late but I got to deliver it one say that it's my first time here I do not want to get the reputation of being a pharaoh preacher I'm gonna let God's people go one say something else base your thoughts on thus saith the Lord and God will confirm it are you ready for this Jesus is walking with them brother and here's what a prophet said he went straight to the word and began to pour the word in he said oh fools and slow a heart not to understand went back to the Old Testament and begin to prove how that Christ should suffer and raise the third day what was it it was the washing of the Water by the word can I ask but Mary can I establish this in the hearts of the people can I leave I know I'll give you a bunch if you want them I'll print them out and give them to you what the message is I put a lot of time in studying this but this one is what's gripping my heart right now he says the message is the correcting the message is the correcting he said when the church is in trouble that's when a message Goes Forth to correct the thing oh what a correcting there would be see the mysteries of the age he said well correct listen this man running from the presence so we'll know how to behave ourselves act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word see can I say to you like this Believers have an ability to take scriptural correction y'all never heard of the Timex watch give her the Timex watch there's a saying it can take a licking keep on ticking can I say this to you a genuine scene of God will be reconciled to God by the word the message is the correcting is to bring the people back to the word that we would know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error what are you saying preacher I'm saying the word corrects the error can I give you something real deep can I give you something real deep is that okay okay we have a lot of situations we have a lot of things happening things go on directions come doctrines come winds come all kinds of things happen and people sit down and do what they do they say these words how we gonna fix it come on Church y'all know in a local church situation to rise and people say how we gonna fix this are you ready for this really deep answer are you ready you got your notebooks out you ready preach the message just preach the message the message will correct the error the message will correct the error listen when Jesus got done with him disciples he poured the word in washed all the trash out their eyes come open and they declare that this is him that was dead he is alive again oh Church of the Living God it's high time to declare this is another brother Mary Emmaus roadwalk we were full of all kinds of Errors we didn't know how many gods there were we didn't know how to preach we didn't know how to receive the Holy Ghost but when the prophet of God took us on a six-hour sermon and the entire seed of the Bible was sown in the heart of the Bride when he got done breaking the bread she looked there and said this is him this is him and all the sadness left their heart all the trash was gone now listen trash is going to come in the church it's going to come in it's going to come in and preach this message and listen I'm just saying this from my heart I believe God has put your pasture to preach it you believe that now you know what you got to do you got to show up for the Washington testing testing one two testing you got to show up for the Washington you got to come to church and open your heart and say Lord pour your life pour your life into me and when you let him pour his life into you he'll wash your life out and the same life will be manifested in the bride once the musicians come this morning the message the message the message the message of the hour he has the correcting [Applause] how many can say Lord how many can say Lord pour your life into me Wash Me Wash Me or the Mervin just just let your word Lord let it Wash Me let it Wash Me I remember brother Paul when I first started preaching so some young ministers we were sitting around and they were talking they said you know they I don't know how to say this is kind of Blazing Trails for new revelation you know man I found this and I found that and I found this you know and I'll be honest with you I was just kind of sitting there you know and I was like man you know I ain't finding all this stuff you know so I'd go try to find an assist I couldn't find it you know so one day I was talking brother Wayne I said man I'm not finding what these guys are talking about he said you want to say something new I said well apparently that's the thing to do he said okay I'm going to tell you something new to say I said okay he said go hear what brother said and then go say it you'll say something new cause ain't nobody saying it you know all this trash is getting in the church it's because people quit saying what a prophet said you know why marriages are falling apart it's because we brought psychology in the house of God trying to fix marriages and quit saying what a prophet's saying listen I I'm not here to be a politician I'm a preacher if you want to kick the trash out preach the message you know why our homes are becoming cesspools it's cause every filthy and ungodly form of entertainment is crepe its way right in and we don't say nothing about it because it's unpopular and we don't want to be unpopular amen if you want to clean your house out go home and turn this message on you want to bring the atmosphere listen I know where I'm at you want to bring the atmosphere the holy ghost in your home turn on something that'll invite his presence they may say preacher makeup's coming back in the church I know it is I'm not crazy me and my wife for somebody the other day and I looked at her I said honey I said there's nobody preaching on makeup she said what do you mean I said everybody's wearing it seems like you know why it's coming back in because a bunch of panty-waste preachers laid down their position and didn't say what a prophet said because some little news article on the internet where somebody said brother Brown was it wrong for saying dog meat and so that devil is crap it's way right now oh God crap its way right back in on the faces of our young girls but I say God give us some men give us some fathers it'll extend on what a prophet said and say the only woman painted her face was Jezebel not backing up I'm not shunning to declare what the headship has revealed to me no I'm telling the truth you know I'm telling the truth television just come right back in you know why because men failed to declare what a prophet said about it wasn't popular wasn't popular to stand there and say if you had one of them things I'd take a shotgun to it wasn't popular somebody's going to declare it you know what oh god brother Mary I'm sorry it's just coming you know why church is the last thing on your list you know why it's because somebody failed to declare to you or you failed to hear that you should not forsake the assembling of yourselves together listen I know we're at the point we ought to be shout but I'm just following him right now you know why you miss church to take your babies to sports it's because of sports is your god it's time somebody declare it you know what I say to every clean living family in this building this morning God bless you why do you say

want to say this in conjunction to what our brother said no psychological help is going to be mixed with the message of the hour if we have children we have to give them correction we have to do it according to the word of God we can't say we'll just take a psychological approach and it will turn out right because it won't the only thing that will is the word of God how much more the Sons and Daughters of God brothers and sisters if you've got a spanking today I know I did if you've got a spanking today Rejoice because God loves you he's not punishing us to to hurt us he's punishing us to
