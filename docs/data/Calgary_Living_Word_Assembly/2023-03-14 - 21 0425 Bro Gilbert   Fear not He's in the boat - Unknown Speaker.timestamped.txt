[10:29] our most gracious Lord
[10:33] Our Father Who Art in Heaven

[10:40] morning Lord Jesus Christ
[10:43] with that song being the confessions of
[10:46] our hearts Lord
[10:48] nothing we can compare with the promise
[10:51] that we have in you Lord
[10:54] heavenly father as we come before thee
[10:57] this morning
[10:58] we have only one desire
[11:01] we want to hear from you Lord
[11:04] in times like this we need the revealed
[11:08] word of the hour
[11:09] in times like this we need a God that we
[11:13] can commune with laws and that's the
[11:16] reason we are here Heavenly Father
[11:19] you are not satisfied when you created
[11:21] the Angels Lord you had to create a man
[11:24] for the purpose of worshiping you we are
[11:27] here Lord would you accept our worship
[11:29] Heavenly Father
[11:31] we want to get the service now in your
[11:34] hands Lord

[11:39] and try me Lord May you search our
[11:41] hearts this morning Lord and in the
[11:44] course of searching father if you find
[11:46] anything Lord that we don't we don't

[12:02] on the internet father we all want to be
[12:04] in one of God with one purpose Lord to
[12:08] hear from you and heavenly father if I
[12:11] would be a hindrance for your children
[12:12] to hear what thou has prepared for them
[12:15] this morning would you take me away Lord
[12:19] just take me away Heavenly Father may I
[12:22] not be a hindrance father because your
[12:24] children have come expecting Lord they

[12:57] why thou on others are calling
[13:00] and for your children who will be

[13:04] want to commit them in your hands now as
[13:07] we go to read your word we ask for your
[13:09] blessings upon it in Jesus Christ's name
[13:12] we pray
[13:13] amen
[13:14] thank you musicians
[13:23] while you are still standing I hope that
[13:26] we turn to our Bibles
[13:28] Matthew chapter 24 we read from three
[13:32] places Matthew chapter 24
[13:35] Matthew chapter 14 from verse 24
[13:38] then revelation
[13:41] 1
[13:43] chapter 1 verses 16 to 18 then lastly
[13:47] first John
[13:50] Chapter 4 verses 18.
[13:56] Matthew chapter 14.
[14:21] okay
[14:28] we can read
[14:29] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[14:32] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[14:35] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[14:38] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[14:41] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[14:44] walking on the sea they were troubled
[14:46] saying it is it is a spirit and they
[14:50] cried out for fear but straight away
[14:53] Jesus speak unto them saying be of good
[14:56] cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter
[15:01] answered him and said Lord if it be thou
[15:04] if it be thou beat me come unto thee on
[15:08] the water
[15:09] and he said come
[15:11] and when Peter was come down out of the
[15:13] ship he walked on the water to go to
[15:16] Jesus but when he saw the wind Paul
[15:18] Saras he was afraid and beginning to
[15:21] sink he cried saying Lord save me and
[15:27] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[15:29] hand and caught him and said unto him or
[15:32] thou of little faith
[15:34] wherefore this thou doubt
[15:41] then
[15:43] Revelation chapter 1.
[15:54] 17 and 18.
[15:56] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[16:00] dead and he laid his hand right his
[16:03] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[16:06] not I am the first and the last I am he
[16:10] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[16:14] alive forever more amen and I have the
[16:17] keys of hell and of death
[16:20] then fast John
[16:23] chapter 4 verse 18.
[16:32] there is no fear in love
[16:35] but perfect love casteth out fear
[16:39] because fear has tormented he that
[16:42] feareth is not made perfect in love
[16:45] may God bless the reading of the world
[16:48] and you can have your seeds
[16:54] always you Saints
[16:57] those who are here and those who are
[16:59] watching
[17:00] who have tuned in on the internet
[17:03] I say may God richly bless you
[17:07] now this morning
[17:11] I want to talk about
[17:14] okay this subject I started I started it
[17:17] in late preach it's a long subject
[17:20] and I started in let's preach I will
[17:24] touch on it today
[17:26] and probably I'll do the conclusion of
[17:29] it in let's preach God willing
[17:32] so and it is about
[17:35] the title is fear not he is in the pot
[17:39] and the songs that we sang the summer
[17:41] the songs that we sang in the prayers
[17:43] that were Prayed by Brother Henry and
[17:45] brother Peter they summarized everything
[17:47] [Laughter]
[17:49] oh my what a wonderful God we saw
[17:52] you're not he's in the pot
[17:55] now the inspiration of this subject
[17:57] comes from the message I know my
[18:01] redeemable
[18:05] then also from another message called
[18:07] Awakening Jesus
[18:10] so for you to awaken him he must be in
[18:13] the pot
[18:16] and for you to say that I know my
[18:19] reading my liveth you must have that
[18:21] experience
[18:24] and that is all that we need that
[18:27] experience to say that I know
[18:30] regardless of the situation that I am in
[18:33] I know
[18:36] when you come to that point those are
[18:38] solid Believers that God is looking for
[18:45] now we are living in times of fear
[18:48] fear is everywhere
[18:51] the age that we are living in when the
[18:53] Lord looks down he sees a lot of fear
[18:57] and there must be a situation or else
[19:00] you cannot find me seated relaxing
[19:02] myself then you tell me fear not
[19:05] I I I I'll be surprised at what you are
[19:07] telling me
[19:08] so for you to tell me fear not you must
[19:12] see me in a situation
[19:14] that is not good for me then as a word
[19:18] of encouragement you tell me brother
[19:20] fear not
[19:22] so here the Lord Jesus Christ he comes
[19:26] and says fear not
[19:29] amen
[19:31] now
[19:34] the whole story
[19:36] you can also get it from the message
[19:38] called the testimonies
[19:40] now Jesus had done some Miracles he had
[19:44] 35
[19:46] 000 people with bread
[19:48] and they were satisfied
[19:51] then he decided to take a break
[19:55] away from the disciples he went to be by
[19:59] himself
[20:00] why did he went to be by himself he left
[20:09] and sometimes you can keep a testimony
[20:12] when things are good
[20:14] [Laughter]
[20:18] amen
[20:19] so they were having one time oh what a
[20:23] mighty God we serve oh these this this
[20:26] man this is more than a man I have never
[20:29] seen something like that
[20:31] that was wonderful but he had taken time
[20:36] to be by himself
[20:40] then
[20:42] the disciples decided to follow him
[20:46] to go where he was
[20:48] now they had to take a ship to take them
[20:52] to where he was
[20:55] why did they why did they started their
[20:57] journey in the initial stages of the
[21:00] journey things were good
[21:04] full of testimonies oh brother let me
[21:06] give my testimony oh sister let me give
[21:08] my testimony oh let me give my testimony
[21:11] that was good
[21:14] then
[21:16] the dark edges came
[21:21] the waves started becoming uncomfortable
[21:26] they started sinking
[21:29] then they forgot about the testimonies
[21:31] they had given
[21:34] but in all that situation Jesus knew
[21:40] the situation was under control
[21:43] oh my goodness if God can only help us
[21:46] to know that he's in control whatever
[21:49] situation that you are going in
[21:51] whatever situation that you are going
[21:53] through God is in control
[21:55] if only we can know that
[21:58] so
[22:03] things changed
[22:06] and
[22:09] the Bible where we have read it says he
[22:12] came in the fourth watch
[22:16] in the old times
[22:19] time was divided into watches of three
[22:22] hours
[22:24] now he came in the fourth watch
[22:28] now in the fourth words oh my goodness
[22:32] may God help us
[22:33] in the fourth word that is the darkest
[22:36] part of the night
[22:39] it is between 3 AM and 6 a.m that is the
[22:44] darkest part of the night and remember
[22:47] at that time it is preparing for the
[22:51] rising of the Sun
[22:54] so during that Darkest Hour of the night
[22:58] remember there is going to come ashalom
[23:02] there is going to come on Easter there
[23:06] is going to come the rising of the Sun
[23:12] so in that darkest part of the hour
[23:16] when the situation changed
[23:19] then Jesus Christ came and said fear not
[23:24] it is I be not afraid
[23:28] would you like to hear such a word from
[23:30] Jesus Christ
[23:31] it is I Be not Afraid whatever situation
[23:35] that you are going through remember be
[23:38] not
[23:39] don't be afraid
[23:43] [Music]
[23:48] so
[23:49] we can also say
[23:52] he took a journey
[23:55] to be by himself and he left us in our
[23:59] journey of seven Church ages
[24:03] now in that seven judge ages the first
[24:06] three judge ages things were good until
[24:10] there came The Darkest Hour the Dark
[24:13] Ages
[24:14] but remember after the darker edges
[24:17] there was going to come the rising of
[24:20] the Sun
[24:23] now when he comes he comes so that he
[24:27] could he can give you the confidence
[24:29] that whatever situation you are in is by
[24:32] your by your side
[24:38] [Music]
[24:44] now
[24:46] at desperate times
[24:48] he comes to declare that don't be afraid
[24:52] at desperate times
[24:55] no wonder the message the prophet
[24:57] preached the message which he called
[24:58] desperation if we can get desperate
[25:01] then he comes on the scene
[25:06] always he comes at the right time in the
[25:08] message be not afraid
[25:10] he says paragraph 11
[25:14] . now I thought on tonight a subject of
[25:17] Our Testimony meeting out of the Bible
[25:20] and I want to read for a text out of
[25:23] Saint Matthew that that is where we read
[25:25] verse 27 and straight away Jesus speak
[25:28] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[25:31] I Be not Afraid now I want to to take a
[25:36] subject for this testimony meeting of Be
[25:39] not Afraid there are two elements that
[25:42] control the entire human race in the
[25:44] world one of them is fear the other is
[25:48] Faith now it is either fear or faith
[25:51] that controls every nation every
[25:53] denomination every individual you are
[25:56] either fear or faith that controls you
[26:14] okay
[26:16] now
[26:19] there is no sitting on the fence
[26:24] you have to take one side
[26:27] either fear
[26:29] or faith
[26:33] may God give me Faith to trust him
[26:38] there is no sitting on the fence you
[26:40] have to take sight
[26:42] and you have to decide we are going to
[26:44] see don't worry
[26:46] now
[26:48] as we look at different situations in
[26:50] our lives
[26:52] there are so many situations around us
[26:57] there that has caused a lot of fear
[27:02] be it employment
[27:05] there is this issue of govid
[27:08] Now everywhere is covered
[27:11] and remember the prophet says what is
[27:14] what is what is going to come is worse
[27:18] even cancer will just be like a
[27:20] toothache
[27:22] so what is going to come is worse than
[27:24] even covet
[27:27] hello
[27:29] yeah
[27:31] so for there for him to come and say
[27:34] fear not there must be a situation that
[27:37] has brought fear
[27:39] now the whole world is under fear
[27:43] everybody you meet every everybody be
[27:46] they presents Prime Ministers what talk
[27:50] of anybody is afraid
[27:54] no wonder
[27:57] they sing a song and said men's hearts
[28:00] are failing for fear
[28:06] but as the world is under fear there is
[28:11] a group of people
[28:14] I wish I'm one of them
[28:17] there is a group of people that God
[28:20] comes and tells them
[28:22] fear not
[28:25] it is I
[28:26] he's in control
[28:29] I don't know if we are getting it he's
[28:31] in control of every situation
[28:35] you say brother you you say even the
[28:37] situation that I went through he was
[28:39] only he was in control yes
[28:41] men
[28:42] he's there he brings a situation he can
[28:47] only allow a situation to come to you
[28:50] because he has confidence in you
[28:59] he allowed the situation to come to job
[29:01] then he says he posts about job by
[29:05] telling the devil have you seen my
[29:07] servant job
[29:11] then the devil says Ah
[29:13] he trusts you because you have you have
[29:16] you have protected him just give me one
[29:19] more one moment
[29:22] but God had the confidence in the job
[29:25] and today God has his children that he
[29:29] has confidence in them he can post about
[29:32] them
[29:35] he can say have you considered have you
[29:38] considered my son Henry in Calgary
[29:43] he has confidence in them
[29:47] as we shall see how or why he has
[29:50] confidence in you
[29:53] amen don't worry just give me time we'll
[29:57] get to the we'll get to the bearing of
[29:59] the someone
[30:00] I'm just laying the introduction
[30:02] but for those who are in leather
[30:04] preacher I know that you've uh to this
[30:05] day that you know where I'm going
[30:08] but that was just part of it although
[30:10] brother
[30:12] mavin came and entered into that sermon
[30:15] he slashed part of it but I'll still
[30:17] come back and connect amen
[30:19] [Music]
[30:21] no
[30:23] there must be a situation
[30:27] and the situations will come
[30:30] situations will come to cause fear
[30:35] so that those who will be those who will
[30:38] be afraid they will be afraid they will
[30:40] just be living under fear all these all
[30:44] these all these but there is a group of
[30:46] people that God has confidence in them
[30:49] he can say I know
[30:52] that is my son
[30:59] amen
[31:01] now
[31:02] when God created human beings there was
[31:05] no faculty of fear
[31:08] why because we were created as gods
[31:13] and we had Authority
[31:16] Adam had Authority
[31:18] and as long as he had the authority
[31:22] everything was under his control
[31:25] he could speak to Nature
[31:28] and nature would obey him
[31:33] hello
[31:36] as long as he had the authority the
[31:39] prophet talks about the authority you
[31:41] can see a police woman
[31:43] however short or small she is as long as
[31:47] she has the crown
[31:50] once she leaves her hand
[31:53] a track of 24 feet long they have to
[31:57] pull
[31:59] why not because of the stature of the
[32:02] person but because of the authority
[32:05] and God has given us the authority I
[32:07] wish God could open our understanding to
[32:10] know who we are
[32:13] sometimes we sing We Know Who We Are
[32:16] but when the situation comes without
[32:18] ourselves
[32:21] so
[32:23] Adam had the authority and it is that
[32:27] Authority after the fall that was taken
[32:29] away
[32:30] and because it was taken away now our
[32:33] restoration is to go back to Eden where
[32:37] Adam had the authority
[32:41] is it possible
[32:44] yes
[32:45] God has proved it through the prophet
[32:48] that it can be done you can surrender
[32:52] yourself until God can use you
[32:56] to control nature
[33:00] where the Prophet says you can create
[33:03] your own world and live in
[33:09] are we ready
[33:11] some of the things we hear the prophet
[33:13] say we wonder if it is true but it is
[33:16] true
[33:20] when
[33:21] and if we have perfect word
[33:25] then it should reproduce perfect faith
[33:29] and the perfect faith
[33:32] is nothing but love
[33:36] when you come to that point where you
[33:39] have perfect faith when you are
[33:41] controlled by nothing but love
[33:44] then you can take control of every
[33:47] situation
[33:51] sometimes we wonder whether these things
[33:53] are true but this is what we have been
[33:55] called for
[34:00] eign
[34:05] then why should we live below our
[34:07] privileges
[34:11] foreign
[34:12] why do we cry
[34:16] see
[34:17] now in the message fundamental
[34:19] foundations for faith
[34:21] paragraph nine
[34:24] man was made as a secondary God on Earth
[34:29] he was given the power to control all
[34:31] things all elements of the earth that
[34:35] was Adam Adam was given these great
[34:37] Powers but then the power that he was
[34:40] given to make himself is where he fell
[34:43] and Adam could speak to the winds and it
[34:46] would stop he could speak to the trees
[34:49] and they would obey him he could speak
[34:52] to the wildlife he would it would obey
[34:55] him
[34:56] he could speak to the waters ever
[34:59] whatever it was everything obeyed Adam
[35:03] now that is the beginning of man that is
[35:06] what God give him power over everything
[35:10] on the earth now through the fall he
[35:13] lost that power then he becomes
[35:15] unconscious of the fact that losing his
[35:19] relationship and friendship and the
[35:21] fellowship with the father
[35:23] then he lost that and all of his great
[35:26] channels become clogged up and he
[35:29] couldn't get through now what Adam was
[35:32] in God Christ has redeemed us back to
[35:35] that now a redeemer to redeem anything
[35:39] is to bring it back to its original
[35:42] origin again
[35:44] and Adam never had to be sick
[35:47] he never had to die he never had a worry
[35:50] he never had a headache he never had a
[35:53] fear he charged crimed up in the arms of
[35:56] the father and just like a child and
[35:59] everything was his
[36:02] and
[36:06] now when man fell he lost this and now
[36:11] what he lost in the fall Christ come as
[36:13] a redeemer did you ever stop to think
[36:16] what Christ redeemed us for he gave us
[36:20] everlasting life he brought us back to
[36:23] the Eternal fellowship and the
[36:25] relationship to God to be his sons and
[36:27] daughters again to restore back all that
[36:31] Adam lost in the fall now the thing of
[36:34] it is since he has restored man back to
[36:39] this place man in the fall had lost all
[36:42] his consciousness of what father put him
[36:44] here on Earth to do in other words all
[36:48] the plumbing as it was in our praying
[36:50] and Outlets the faith has been clocked
[36:53] up with a business affair with a home
[36:56] life domestic things it all it has all
[37:00] become so clogged so clocked up that
[37:03] until God can't operate through those
[37:05] channels that he made Man full
[37:12] after the fall
[37:15] the channels got clocked
[37:18] we lost our consciousness of what our
[37:22] father made us for
[37:25] but if only God can open our eyes of
[37:29] understanding
[37:31] and the Prophet The Prophet's prayer was
[37:34] for our eyes of understanding to be
[37:37] opened
[37:38] for the channels to be unclocked
[37:41] so that God can use us so that we can
[37:44] trust him so that we can obey him
[37:53] amen
[37:56] may he help me to unclog the channels
[38:02] so that he can flow through
[38:05] but our channels are so cloaked that
[38:09] when he wants to flow through he can't
[38:12] we can't allow him to flow through
[38:15] but this morning if only we can allow
[38:18] him to unclog through the preaching of
[38:21] the word if I can unclog the channels
[38:24] then God can flow through me then I can
[38:27] see what he has made me for
[38:29] eign
[38:30] amen
[38:37] if God designed man's body he certainly
[38:40] designed the body of his son the church
[38:42] and he has designed us to come together
[38:45] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[38:48] have this Supernatural workings of God
[38:50] out of it through gifts of the Spirit
[38:52] such as prophecy and wisdom and
[38:54] knowledge and the gifts of healing and
[38:57] all these other different gifts is
[38:59] Outlets that God lets us his power and
[39:03] lets out his Revelation to the people
[39:05] and not as an in not as an individual so
[39:09] much but as a Unity we are all together
[39:13] great body of believers
[39:17] the Mystic body
[39:19] there is the body
[39:22] that is the church the local church but
[39:24] there is the mystical body
[39:27] you can be in the local body but you are
[39:30] not in the mystical body
[39:33] may God help us to unblock the channels
[39:36] so that he can help us to flow through
[39:39] until
[39:41] we see ourselves in that mystical body
[39:44] that the mystical body the the members
[39:47] are very few
[39:50] but the local bodies we can we we can we
[39:53] can create situations who have as many
[39:55] people as we want
[39:57] but my greatest desire is to end that
[40:01] mystical body
[40:02] to see myself in that mystical body
[40:06] that is what is important
[40:09] amen
[40:12] oh the word says by his stripes we were
[40:14] healed but we allow the devil to remind
[40:17] us of that brother or that sister who
[40:19] died of that disease we have an
[40:21] opportunity to go back again to where we
[40:24] can live a Carefree life without fear
[40:29] we have an opportunity
[40:32] that's why he came
[40:34] oh my
[40:36] now
[40:38] since man fell every time God visits him
[40:42] the greetings have always been fear not
[40:48] when he came to Abraham
[40:50] he told Abraham fear not
[40:53] in blessings I will bless you
[40:57] when he come to Moses he told Moses fear
[41:01] not this Pharaoh that you see
[41:03] he will not see him again
[41:08] amen when he came to capria when he when
[41:12] the Capri the angel came to Daniel
[41:14] he said fear not the day you knelt down
[41:18] to pray
[41:19] your prayer was answered
[41:22] can you imagine
[41:24] the very first time you knelt down to
[41:27] pray your prayer was answered
[41:29] so he was said to bring the solution but
[41:32] he was withheld
[41:34] by the demons
[41:43] when he came to America
[41:45] he said fear not
[41:48] when he came to Joseph he said fear not
[41:52] to take thy wife Mary
[41:54] fear not so when he comes he says fear
[41:58] not
[42:00] if he comes here this morning he will
[42:03] say fear not
[42:05] Little Flock fear not
[42:08] so whenever he appears people have
[42:10] always say oh the Lord appeared to me
[42:12] okay fine how did he greet you
[42:15] every time he comes he says fear not and
[42:19] for him to say fear not because he knows
[42:21] they are fearful situations and the
[42:23] circumstances
[42:28] [Music]
[42:31] now
[42:34] let's imagine like a child is screaming
[42:36] because of a nightmare
[42:39] but if the father comes and says don't
[42:41] worry son I'm around
[42:44] now the life that we live in
[42:48] its nightmares and that's why we cry we
[42:52] scream but remember he is in control
[42:57] when he comes he says fear not
[43:00] we cry fine but when he comes he says
[43:04] fear not
[43:07] it is I be not afraid
[43:10] oh my
[43:12] now from the scripture where we read
[43:15] Jesus came to write with them personally
[43:18] he came in the ship so that he could
[43:21] write with them personally
[43:24] and as as he wanted his children not to
[43:27] go through the circumstances with fear
[43:34] I wish we could see it
[43:39] fear not he's in the pot
[43:42] fear not he's here
[43:45] fear not he's with us
[43:48] Little Flock fear not
[43:50] whatever the situation fear not he's
[43:53] here
[43:55] whatever you are going through fear not
[43:57] he's in the boat
[43:59] now if he's in the port
[44:02] then we can awaken him
[44:06] you remember
[44:08] in that boat where he was he was he was
[44:11] dead asleep
[44:12] and the disciples when the situation
[44:15] changed they cried they had to go and
[44:19] awake him
[44:21] and the prophet in the message Awakening
[44:24] Jesus he says he is always there
[44:29] he's always there
[44:31] he's in our meetings
[44:34] so what we only need to do is to wake
[44:37] him up
[44:40] he's in you
[44:42] he's in me what I only need to do is to
[44:45] wake him up
[44:49] I I don't know whether we are saying
[44:51] this preference he's he's there
[44:54] that's the reason he came on Mount
[44:57] sunset
[44:58] he came so that he can he can write with
[45:02] us in the pot or in the ship
[45:04] so that he can be with us
[45:07] so that Saint John Chapter 14 verse 20
[45:10] where he says in that day you will know
[45:14] so we want to come to a point where we
[45:16] can say I know
[45:22] that is the person who knows where he or
[45:27] she is standing
[45:30] you can say I know
[45:34] I know situation I know
[45:36] my regime
[45:39] I want to have that assurance
[45:43] that is the evidence of the Holocaust
[45:45] you know
[45:48] when it comes to the point where you say
[45:50] I know
[45:52] yes you can push me you can push me that
[45:55] is okay but beyond here I know my
[45:58] redeemer lives
[46:06] in that message I know the prophet says
[46:11] God has a purpose in you
[46:16] he cannot allow his purpose to be
[46:19] defeated
[46:22] oh my goodness he cannot allow his
[46:26] purpose to be defeated
[46:28] go and listen to that message
[46:31] he says when the Hebrew children
[46:35] when the king ordered for the fire to be
[46:39] multiplied seven times
[46:41] the Prophet The Prophet says as long as
[46:44] Court's purpose was there even if it was
[46:47] heated one million times
[46:50] one million times could not defeat the
[46:53] purpose of God
[46:55] so if you know God has a purpose in your
[46:58] life then
[47:00] why fear
[47:02] why fear
[47:05] the only thing you can say I know
[47:08] I know
[47:10] and that's where we need to come to
[47:12] president
[47:13] you come to a point where you say I know
[47:17] for he slay me though whatever happens
[47:19] but I know
[47:26] amen
[47:33] okay
[47:47] okay
[47:50] amen
[47:53] so
[47:55] fear is put up love
[47:58] we can have confidence in the man who
[48:01] came down on Mount sunset and he's in
[48:04] the boat today
[48:07] he came so that he can write with us
[48:11] laughs
[48:13] he came so that he can write with you
[48:17] in the board
[48:19] he is in the port
[48:21] you only need to do wake him up
[48:26] wake him up
[48:29] okay
[48:31] amen
[48:35] now
[48:37] in the message the preach between the
[48:39] seven Church H's and the Seven Seals
[48:41] paragraph 251.
[48:44] the prophet says but now in this world
[48:47] Sevenfold book of seals of redemption
[48:50] that the lamp took within himself was
[48:53] the only one who could do it and he took
[48:56] it from the right hand of him that sat
[48:58] upon the throne now to claim his
[49:01] Redemptive to claim his rights to claim
[49:04] for me and you what he redeemed us from
[49:08] to see back to everything that Adam Lost
[49:13] In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us
[49:16] back to that now with the lamp with a
[49:19] book in his hands we are ready to ask
[49:22] his grace and mercy upon us to open the
[49:25] seven sealed book to us and let us see
[49:27] past the curtain of time just a little
[49:30] bit oh my notice when he took the book
[49:33] the title did sealed just get that in
[49:37] your mind now and procure the sins of
[49:39] the mystery to reveal them to bring them
[49:42] to his own
[49:49] now
[49:51] when God created human human mind he
[49:54] created us a subconscious mind that is
[49:58] very powerful
[50:01] he created another faculty called
[50:03] imagination which is the creative power
[50:06] of human being
[50:08] I want that one to sing firstly
[50:12] he created
[50:13] you see there is the human mind and
[50:17] behind that there is subconscious
[50:22] now that is where the imagination is
[50:26] in your imagination you can imagine
[50:30] anything
[50:31] you can create anything in imaginations
[50:35] you can imagine a situation
[50:37] in that situation let's say I'm just
[50:40] giving an example you I can start
[50:42] imagining that brother Peter hates me
[50:45] so
[50:47] the devil takes that one he uses
[50:49] imaginations so the Devil comes and
[50:52] takes that and he creates a situation
[50:54] even when when brother Peter that is not
[50:57] aware of what is happening when I see
[50:59] him I avoid him
[51:05] you created the situation in your
[51:07] imagination
[51:10] and in that imagination now the Devil
[51:12] comes and takes that situation he
[51:15] magnifies it
[51:17] so he he creates that situation he makes
[51:20] it look so bad now in that imagination
[51:22] you can create the worst situation or
[51:25] the best situation
[51:31] so how do you overcome that
[51:34] the prophet says do the opposite
[51:39] when the Devil comes and tells you put
[51:48] your brother can it happen
[51:54] do the opposite
[51:57] so that subconsciousness
[52:01] that imagination
[52:03] that is where the devil takes advantage
[52:08] when you imagine something
[52:10] you are subconsciousness records it as
[52:13] real
[52:17] just give me time
[52:19] we will get there
[52:22] that's how situations arises
[52:25] you can see Believers hurting others
[52:28] it's just because of creating situations
[52:31] you create a situation and the Devil
[52:34] comes and takes advantage he magnifies
[52:38] that situation
[52:40] then it becomes so real until
[52:53] oh my and that's why the Bible says as a
[52:57] man thinketh in his heart so he said
[53:01] what you are imagining what you are
[53:04] imagining even right now what you are
[53:05] imagining
[53:08] the devil takes advantage
[53:10] that is the channel That the the
[53:13] devotees advantage
[53:16] your imagination
[53:18] you start creating some situations you
[53:21] imagine some situations then the devil
[53:24] magnifies that situation
[53:26] may God help us
[53:28] the prophet told us do the opposite
[53:32] okay
[53:35] when the fall came the devil took our
[53:37] creative power to create his own
[53:39] situations he tapped into our
[53:41] imaginations
[53:43] when a human being imagine something and
[53:45] holds onto it for so long it becomes so
[53:48] real
[53:51] and then he starts acting on that
[53:54] God help us
[53:58] okay
[54:00] now the origin
[54:04] okay in control of our imaginations
[54:15] and sometimes we invite situations in
[54:18] our lives by imagining them
[54:22] yeah
[54:23] you start imagining something
[54:26] you continue thinking about it
[54:28] it continues it continues until it
[54:31] becomes real
[54:33] may God help me
[54:35] I would like this subject we go deeper
[54:38] so that we cast out demons in our in our
[54:40] meetings
[54:41] we cast out fear in our in our meetings
[54:44] we want we are we are God's children
[54:47] we are we are we are in the rapture
[54:51] we are candidates for the Rapture so
[54:53] there should be nothing between us
[55:00] amen
[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] okay
[55:08] now in the message perfect Faith
[55:10] paragraph 105.
[55:13] Peter he was doing all right
[55:16] till he got scared
[55:18] the word told him he could walk on the
[55:20] water he was scared fast he thought it
[55:23] was it was a cost and he said Lord if it
[55:26] be you beat me to come to the water
[55:33] Peter
[55:36] Lord if it is you beat me to come
[55:41] what did Jesus say come
[55:49] may God help us
[55:54] if you ask
[55:56] the way Peter asked if it is you beat me
[55:59] to come
[56:01] he was told to come
[56:04] and it's only Peter apart from the Lord
[56:07] Jesus Christ it's only Peter
[56:09] that we know of a man who walked on the
[56:12] waters
[56:14] so the prophet says he was doing all
[56:16] right
[56:18] until he started looking at the
[56:21] circumstances
[56:25] it reminds me the story
[56:27] of some two Believers some two brothers
[56:29] they went to pray
[56:32] so
[56:33] they started praying they started
[56:35] praying then one
[56:38] uh he he ran short of what to pray for
[56:41] so in the process if you are not praying
[56:46] then you are listening to what the other
[56:49] the other brother is praying so when the
[56:52] other brother was praying he was saying
[56:55] Lord if it is you who called me let me
[56:59] not waste your time fill me with the
[57:01] Holy Ghost and let me not waste your
[57:03] time fill me the whole with the
[57:05] Holocaust I want an assurance I want to
[57:08] know that I am U.S and the U.S alone
[57:12] let me not leave this place until you
[57:15] have given me the assurance
[57:23] he could not leave that place the same
[57:25] way the same the same the same person he
[57:27] went
[57:29] now let's change the situation
[57:33] if it is God who called you
[57:37] can we also challenge him to keep to
[57:38] fill us with the Holocaust
[57:42] can we challenge him
[57:45] we need to get to a point where we
[57:47] challenge him
[57:48] if that bad brother challenged God until
[57:51] he could not leave that place the way he
[57:54] went and we are also the same we can
[57:56] also do this
[58:00] then we get out of fear
[58:06] hello
[58:09] if it is you
[58:14] if it is him who called you
[58:17] you are not here by chance if you are
[58:19] here by chance you live by Chance the
[58:22] same way you came the same way you go
[58:25] hello
[58:27] please I hope you will forgive me
[58:31] but I want this this point to sink
[58:33] because remember we said that they are
[58:37] not there is no standing in the middle
[58:39] it is either Faith or doubt
[58:44] now if we are going to take Faith
[58:47] then we need to challenge God
[58:51] we need to come to a point where we can
[58:54] say Lord
[58:57] let's see let's they say like Peter
[58:59] if it is you
[59:02] beat me to come
[59:05] can we also ask the same
[59:09] can we
[59:14] if it is him who called you if it is him
[59:17] who called me then I need to come to a
[59:20] point where I can say I know my little
[59:23] madivas
[59:24] I know
[59:29] sorry for shouting
[59:34] but
[59:35] can we act like Peter
[59:37] can we say like a Peter if it is you who
[59:40] called me
[59:43] I'm not here by chance
[59:46] I know he called me
[59:51] I know he called me
[59:54] now he cannot call you to be lukewarm
[59:56] no
[59:59] he called you to manifest his name
[1:00:03] he called you to manifest his life here
[1:00:05] on Earth
[1:00:07] so if he called me then I need to come
[1:00:10] to a point whereby I can challenge him
[1:00:13] there are no there is no standing in the
[1:00:16] middle you can just you can step on this
[1:00:18] side or no no no no no no it is either
[1:00:20] fear or faith
[1:00:24] I want to take Faith
[1:00:29] I want to take Faith
[1:00:33] are we ready brethrens
[1:00:36] Sue
[1:00:38] I I I don't want to think so much about
[1:00:41] that
[1:00:43] that brother
[1:00:44] first of all let me let me have that
[1:00:46] Assurance myself that I know
[1:00:51] are we ready
[1:00:53] can we can we do something about our
[1:00:55] lives
[1:00:57] can we come to that point where we want
[1:00:59] to say like Peter if it is you who
[1:01:01] called me
[1:01:05] if you did not just find yourself
[1:01:09] Inside by chance no
[1:01:12] but you know he called you
[1:01:16] I know we have some some Believers in
[1:01:18] our meetings they know
[1:01:20] they know
[1:01:23] and I don't want to live on the
[1:01:25] testimony of others
[1:01:27] I want to have my own testimony
[1:01:30] can it happen
[1:01:34] can it happen
[1:01:39] oh my
[1:01:41] God help me
[1:01:43] may God help us
[1:01:45] let's come to that point
[1:01:47] of desperation
[1:01:50] let's come to that point of desperation
[1:01:53] I want to know that I know that I know
[1:01:58] God help us
[1:02:00] so
[1:02:03] uh
[1:02:05] he was scared fast
[1:02:07] he thought it was a cost then he said
[1:02:10] Lord if it be you beat me come to you
[1:02:16] when he beats you to come you don't go
[1:02:19] to the church you go to him
[1:02:24] whoa now that is just as this the same
[1:02:28] as James 5 14 same as Mark 16 the same
[1:02:33] God said it said come on and he started
[1:02:36] walking he done all right he called down
[1:02:39] of the ship he started walking there was
[1:02:42] a storm on the sea you know Great White
[1:02:44] Cap waves bigger than these hills around
[1:02:47] here the form breaking on top of them
[1:02:50] terrific maybe 15 20 feet from the white
[1:02:54] cups breaking and that was a terrific
[1:02:57] thing for him to ask if it Be You Lord
[1:03:00] come
[1:03:01] if it be you
[1:03:03] oh now if it if it is you beat me to
[1:03:09] come on to on the water Jesus said come
[1:03:12] on and he stepped down it's the Lord I
[1:03:16] will just walk but when he caught his
[1:03:18] eyes on the waves he got scared
[1:03:22] when you turn your eyes to the
[1:03:25] situations
[1:03:27] that's where fear comes in
[1:03:30] but as long as he was he was supposed to
[1:03:34] fix his eyes on Jesus
[1:03:37] the one who told him come
[1:03:42] so if we can fix our eyes on him the one
[1:03:46] who told you come the one who bid you
[1:03:50] come
[1:03:51] then don't look at the circumstances
[1:03:56] the circumstances will be there
[1:04:00] but let us look at the one and to him
[1:04:03] that called us
[1:04:05] and to him that beat us to come
[1:04:09] he didn't call us to go to church he
[1:04:11] called us to go to him
[1:04:14] why so that
[1:04:16] you know him
[1:04:20] the way job said I know
[1:04:25] then you have the assurance that he's in
[1:04:27] the ship
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:34] oh my
[1:04:36] it is not enough to say that God has
[1:04:39] sent us a prophet it is not enough to
[1:04:42] say that he came on Mount sunset
[1:04:50] but
[1:04:53] we need our profession
[1:04:56] and the substance to be sure
[1:05:00] and that can only happen if we forget
[1:05:04] about the circumstances the
[1:05:05] circumstances will be there the
[1:05:07] situations will be there they will come
[1:05:10] sometimes you don't invite them they
[1:05:12] will come
[1:05:13] but let that not deviate you from the
[1:05:17] one who called you
[1:05:19] and the one who called you he's in the
[1:05:21] ship
[1:05:22] we can awaken him
[1:05:26] we can awaken him even now
[1:05:29] brother maybe you cannot awaken him
[1:05:32] yeah you can awaken him you can awaken
[1:05:36] him
[1:05:36] he's in the boat
[1:05:38] he's there
[1:05:40] he's only waiting for you to awake him
[1:05:44] oh my
[1:05:47] hey man
[1:05:50] oh my
[1:05:52] okay
[1:05:58] now fear has no evaluation in it
[1:06:01] none whatever it's perfectly endless it
[1:06:05] hasn't got one good thing about it if it
[1:06:09] was to if I was to be shot in the
[1:06:11] morning I was going to be short what
[1:06:14] good would it do to have fear what good
[1:06:17] would it do to me you say well what good
[1:06:21] would Faith do to you Faith could
[1:06:24] deliver me but fear won't help me a bit
[1:06:27] you just get yourself all worked up and
[1:06:31] more nervous than ever when it comes
[1:06:33] time for the Khan to fire so let's have
[1:06:36] faith faith could deliver me but if it
[1:06:39] doesn't what good would fear do anyhow
[1:06:41] just stay right with faith and hold on
[1:06:45] to it
[1:06:49] foreign
[1:06:52] in the message show us the father
[1:06:54] paragraph 55 God doesn't have to use for
[1:06:58] a coward if you are afraid to trust him
[1:07:01] don't even make an effort
[1:07:04] until you are satisfied that he keeps
[1:07:06] his word and he keeps his promise then
[1:07:10] there is nothing going to stop you that
[1:07:12] is right but be sure you know where you
[1:07:15] are standing
[1:07:19] be sure you know where you are standing
[1:07:25] oh my
[1:07:30] okay
[1:07:34] then that brings me to brings me to this
[1:07:36] story
[1:07:47] okay you must know where you are
[1:07:49] standing because you will only make
[1:07:51] yourself worse then I noticed him he's
[1:07:53] talking of an eagle aren't you afraid of
[1:07:56] me I had my right riffle set against a
[1:08:01] tree I said I can grab my rifle rifle
[1:08:04] and shoot you and he just sat there and
[1:08:08] I noticed what why why why is he not
[1:08:12] afraid and I noticed that he had his
[1:08:14] wings he kept feeling them see if the
[1:08:18] feeders was all in running order I
[1:08:22] thought that is it God has given him two
[1:08:25] Wings he has got confidence in them he
[1:08:29] knows that he could be in that Timber
[1:08:31] before I get my my hand on the on the
[1:08:34] gun and he has got perfect confidence in
[1:08:37] his god-given way of escape and if an
[1:08:40] ego in God's Universe can have enough
[1:08:43] confidence in a god-given gift of his
[1:08:46] wings how much much more or to we the
[1:08:49] children of God to have confidence in
[1:08:51] the Holy Spirit even though the doctor
[1:08:53] says you are going to die with cancer
[1:08:56] just as long as you can feel that power
[1:08:58] of God there let everything be alive and
[1:09:01] God's word be true
[1:09:10] I watched him I thought there you are
[1:09:13] gone I see you know you know because he
[1:09:17] has he is not afraid God Hates a Coward
[1:09:20] love casts out fear so if you have got
[1:09:24] love you don't have any fear there is
[1:09:27] nothing fear don't have one bit of value
[1:09:30] about it there is not one thing it will
[1:09:34] hinder you or you say well what if you
[1:09:37] are going to be shot in the morning
[1:09:38] would you be a scared no sir fear
[1:09:42] couldn't help me fear could only make me
[1:09:45] worse well what could Faith do for you
[1:09:48] if they are already assigned that you
[1:09:50] are going to die in the morning faith
[1:09:52] can sign a pattern for me
[1:09:57] and
[1:10:02] so
[1:10:04] in that story The Prophet is talking of
[1:10:07] an ego
[1:10:08] he saw him he was just relaxed
[1:10:11] he was not scared
[1:10:14] so the prophet is saying that ego he
[1:10:17] knew he had confidence in his god-given
[1:10:21] way of Escape
[1:10:24] he trusted in his wings
[1:10:28] so whatever was going in the mind of the
[1:10:31] Prophet the ego was saying I have
[1:10:33] confidence he could just feel the wings
[1:10:38] are they ready oh I can fly are you sure
[1:10:42] you can fly oh yes I can feel I know
[1:10:47] I know
[1:10:51] may God help us
[1:10:55] oh my
[1:10:57] that's the confidence that God needs
[1:10:59] with his children
[1:11:02] I know
[1:11:05] my
[1:11:08] okay
[1:11:10] oh my
[1:11:12] now how do we come to that confidence
[1:11:16] eat the book
[1:11:20] eat the book
[1:11:22] eat the book
[1:11:24] eat the book
[1:11:26] until you become the book
[1:11:28] once you become the book then you have
[1:11:31] that assurance
[1:11:32] where you can say I know
[1:11:36] oh
[1:11:37] my okay
[1:11:43] okay
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:53] now when he came in the ship he came to
[1:11:57] be worshiped he didn't come to listen to
[1:12:00] the believer's problems but he came to
[1:12:02] be worshiped he is in the boat today God
[1:12:06] loves a Covington Christian who stands
[1:12:09] on God's promises
[1:12:14] do we have our promises
[1:12:17] that song you sang it's nothing compares
[1:12:21] to the promise I have
[1:12:25] so if you if that promise is sure
[1:12:28] then you have confidence in that promise
[1:12:32] what is that promise
[1:12:34] we'll never leave you nor forsake you he
[1:12:36] will be with you even in you
[1:12:39] so can you feel him is in you
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:54] fit on the book
[1:12:56] eat until the pyramid is cupped
[1:13:00] what cups the pyramid
[1:13:03] love God bless you my brother
[1:13:09] are we are we ready presidents
[1:13:13] in the book until the pyramid is kept
[1:13:19] and the pyramid is kept with love
[1:13:23] once the pyramid is kept with love then
[1:13:27] you can project that love to any
[1:13:29] situation
[1:13:32] oh yes
[1:13:35] where did the situation come these
[1:13:37] situations will come
[1:13:40] so because the situations will come get
[1:13:44] the book until the pyramid is kept with
[1:13:47] love
[1:13:50] can it happen it happened with the
[1:13:52] prophet
[1:13:53] we don't have time to go into those to
[1:13:56] read those quotes all those quotes
[1:13:59] the prophet
[1:14:03] he exercised that love
[1:14:06] when he was approached by the bull
[1:14:11] it was so fear
[1:14:14] what happened he projected that love
[1:14:20] when he was in the church preaching and
[1:14:23] that man
[1:14:25] he said use naked whatever what happened
[1:14:29] he did not hurt the man
[1:14:31] he loved the man he headed the spirit
[1:14:35] the demons that the man had subjected
[1:14:37] himself to
[1:14:41] so if the prophet was the first fruit to
[1:14:45] mature
[1:14:49] yes
[1:14:51] if he matured to project that love
[1:14:55] then where are we
[1:15:00] let me ask my where am I
[1:15:04] then it calls you and me my brother and
[1:15:08] my sister
[1:15:09] to need to come to a point where you can
[1:15:12] say I know
[1:15:18] and that cannot come by just you sitting
[1:15:20] there
[1:15:26] you just can't sit there remember the
[1:15:29] prophet says take time to pray in the
[1:15:32] fourth watch
[1:15:34] [Laughter]
[1:15:37] yeah take time to pray in the fourth
[1:15:40] watch
[1:15:44] so there is something to do with praying
[1:15:46] in the fourth watch
[1:15:50] yes
[1:15:52] may God help us
[1:15:54] so
[1:15:56] fit on the word eat the book
[1:15:59] any chance you have eat the book
[1:16:02] until the pyramid is cupped with love
[1:16:07] overcoming fear doesn't mean absence of
[1:16:09] circumstances
[1:16:10] no but when you feed on the seven done
[1:16:14] on the seven Thunders and keep on
[1:16:17] feeding you come to that perfect love
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:24] oh my in these fearful times where we
[1:16:28] Face fearful situations economy covet or
[1:16:31] whatever God ordained you to be an
[1:16:33] overcomer
[1:16:35] so what you need to do eat the what what
[1:16:39] upon what what upon what until Divine
[1:16:42] Love Takes Over
[1:16:44] that is my prayer
[1:16:47] I want to eat until Divine Love Takes
[1:16:50] Over
[1:16:52] so when Divine Love Takes Over You
[1:16:56] cannot now look at the situations you
[1:16:58] cannot imagine you can now not put
[1:17:00] things under your imaginations you
[1:17:02] create a situation you allow the devil
[1:17:04] to create situations in your
[1:17:06] imaginations
[1:17:08] no
[1:17:10] you only allow
[1:17:11] love to take
[1:17:13] off and it can happen it can happen
[1:17:16] preference
[1:17:18] have you ever come as in a situation you
[1:17:21] you enter somewhere maybe people are
[1:17:23] talking about worldly things but the
[1:17:25] moment you enter your presence end us
[1:17:27] there they change the subject
[1:17:32] it can happen it is happening among us
[1:17:35] to us
[1:17:39] if only we can allow ourselves
[1:17:42] to unclog the channels so that God can
[1:17:45] flow through
[1:17:46] flow through me flow through me
[1:17:49] oh my
[1:17:52] okay
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:57] oh my
[1:18:00] okay
[1:18:05] I have to rush
[1:18:09] overcoming fear is not called removing
[1:18:12] difficult situations in our lives but we
[1:18:15] can overcome by casting out fear
[1:18:18] completely
[1:18:21] did you get it
[1:18:25] overcoming fear is not God removing
[1:18:28] difficulty situations
[1:18:35] but we can overcome past by casting out
[1:18:39] fear
[1:18:41] fear is the slave of circumstances but
[1:18:45] faith is the master of circumstances
[1:18:48] Hallelujah
[1:18:50] fear Is This Love of circumstances but
[1:18:53] faith is the master
[1:18:56] this does allow the master to come
[1:19:03] let me allow the master to come
[1:19:05] who
[1:19:09] now circumstances are in the middle
[1:19:15] yeah
[1:19:17] but the faith is in the seven sealed
[1:19:20] book
[1:19:22] there is only one thing that is the
[1:19:24] devil fears
[1:19:26] yeah there is always one thing that you
[1:19:29] feel fears
[1:19:31] yeah fears the open book
[1:19:34] because without open the book you are
[1:19:38] restored Back to Eden where Adam was
[1:19:41] without fear
[1:19:45] let's eat the book
[1:19:47] this book has been given to us
[1:19:50] this book has been opened to us for what
[1:19:53] purpose to restore us back
[1:19:56] to what Adam lost
[1:19:59] we are eating what we are we have
[1:20:02] believed what are what if disbelieved
[1:20:05] that's what makes the difference between
[1:20:08] us and if as a pride
[1:20:11] the pride of this day oh my goodness
[1:20:14] that will be a topic for another day
[1:20:17] what God has done
[1:20:20] if faint before she could produce God's
[1:20:23] children
[1:20:25] yeah that was the first if the second if
[1:20:30] which was on which started on the day of
[1:20:32] Pentecost before God could use her to
[1:20:35] manifest God's children
[1:20:38] she failed at nicaea Council
[1:20:42] so now what God has done he knew that
[1:20:48] he died to be like that she will also
[1:20:51] fall like Indiana in the other price so
[1:20:55] he comes with the word and him checks
[1:20:59] the word in you
[1:21:02] so that you get the mind of God
[1:21:07] so when you receive that book
[1:21:10] when you receive that one you have the
[1:21:13] mind of God
[1:21:14] and when you have the mind of God then
[1:21:16] you can say I know
[1:21:19] oh my
[1:21:21] okay
[1:21:24] perfect faith comes by perfect word you
[1:21:27] master the circumstances by hearing the
[1:21:30] word oh my let me Rush
[1:21:34] okay
[1:21:37] God help me
[1:21:45] not just say well I believe Jesus Christ
[1:21:47] as the Son of God that is all right then
[1:21:49] add the rest of it to it you say I have
[1:21:53] been Justified I give my hand to the
[1:21:55] minister I believe in Jesus Christ then
[1:21:57] you have got to be born again you must
[1:22:00] be filled with the Holocaust just keep
[1:22:02] adding on just keep adding on going on
[1:22:05] you are growing into the stature of our
[1:22:08] son and daughter of God my God able to
[1:22:12] prepare us and to give us that grave in
[1:22:15] our life that we want to see something
[1:22:18] how many in here once more of God
[1:22:26] oh my
[1:22:30] I don't know
[1:22:32] we could talk about Elijah
[1:22:35] foreign
[1:22:37] was afraid
[1:22:39] because of the circumstances
[1:22:41] Elijah prayed for his eyes to be opened
[1:22:45] now at that time
[1:22:49] there was
[1:22:51] the Syria there was war
[1:22:53] between the Israelites and the syrians
[1:22:56] now the syrians who are wondering how
[1:23:00] come
[1:23:01] whatever we plan Even in our secrets the
[1:23:06] enemy knows what is happening
[1:23:09] then he see servants told him no
[1:23:13] because those people they have a prophet
[1:23:16] he knows even what you are thinking in
[1:23:18] your bedroom
[1:23:19] do we have a prophet
[1:23:21] yes so if we have a prophet he has given
[1:23:25] us the mind he has he has given us the
[1:23:28] mind so so we know even what the devil
[1:23:30] is planning so if you know what the
[1:23:33] devil is planning what what is the
[1:23:35] solution perfect love
[1:23:38] perfect love
[1:23:40] let's get perfect love
[1:23:42] that is the only thing that will be that
[1:23:44] will defeat the Devil
[1:23:46] oh my
[1:23:48] so or you can read this in second Kings
[1:23:51] chapter 6 verse verses 27. now when
[1:23:55] there was there was Hunger during those
[1:23:58] days and uh okay about the four lepers
[1:24:01] you could converted or read about it but
[1:24:04] the good part of it is those four lepers
[1:24:06] it came to a point where they said now
[1:24:11] here is a situation if we stay here we
[1:24:15] are going to die of hunger
[1:24:17] now if we go
[1:24:20] the armies of the enemy they are going
[1:24:22] to to kill us
[1:24:25] if you are there brother Henry what
[1:24:26] could you have done if you are among the
[1:24:27] four
[1:24:31] so they had
[1:24:34] they had to
[1:24:37] if we stay here
[1:24:40] we are going to die of hunger
[1:24:43] now if we make a step a step to move
[1:24:47] the armies of the other pharaohs they
[1:24:50] are going to kill us
[1:24:54] Jews either faith
[1:24:57] or fear
[1:24:59] if they feared they would have remained
[1:25:02] there but then Faith took hold of the
[1:25:05] situation
[1:25:06] they said let's go anyhow
[1:25:09] death is death but we would rather die
[1:25:13] trying than you sit here without a train
[1:25:16] oh my I love that
[1:25:19] I would rather not gone my knees and
[1:25:21] pray about it that will sit there and
[1:25:23] nothing is happening
[1:25:28] so they make a move let's go
[1:25:31] they started moving oh my I love that
[1:25:35] story I say you are approaching the city
[1:25:37] those guys on the other side
[1:25:40] God opened the eyes of these pharaohs
[1:25:43] the four lepers but he opened the eyes
[1:25:46] of the the ears of those pharaohs they
[1:25:49] had the Chariots coming
[1:25:52] and they said oh my that has flee away
[1:25:55] let us run away the people who are
[1:25:57] coming are many we cannot withstand them
[1:26:00] and
[1:26:02] they ran away and they left everything
[1:26:07] oh my goodness when they came in the
[1:26:11] city they found food was in plenty oh my
[1:26:13] goodness there is plenty of food only if

[1:26:31] he opened the ears of those guys they
[1:26:34] had the Chariots coming they said oh
[1:26:36] fear now fear entered in them
[1:26:39] but this was because they took a step of

[1:26:49] faith
[1:26:54] Give Me Faith alone
[1:26:56] oh yes

[1:27:04] their ears were opened
[1:27:07] they had the Chariots coming
[1:27:09] until they said no we cannot over we
[1:27:13] cannot withstand the armies that is
[1:27:16] coming the army that is coming they are
[1:27:18] clutter than ourselves so they had to
[1:27:20] run away but anybody who doubted the
[1:27:23] promise
[1:27:25] anybody who was afraid
[1:27:28] did not get to the to that place
[1:27:31] to eat the food

[1:28:24] we need faith
[1:28:27] we need faith
[1:28:29] like those four lepers they were lepers
[1:28:31] they were helpless
[1:28:32] but when they exercised their faith
[1:28:35] they got food
[1:28:38] are we ready to exercise our faith
[1:28:41] can you touch the can you touch and feel
[1:28:44] feel he's there
[1:28:46] we have been told he's in the boat
[1:28:49] he's in the ship
[1:28:50] there
[1:28:52] he is here with us that's the reason he
[1:28:55] came on Mount Sunset to be with us so
[1:28:58] he's here with us
[1:28:59] can we wake him up
[1:29:03] touching Jesus is all that I need
[1:29:06] he's in the pot
[1:29:08] you can reach out and touch him
[1:29:12] oh my
[1:29:14] oh my
[1:29:15] oh my I don't have time
[1:29:17] I don't know
[1:29:19] God help us
[1:29:21] now
[1:29:23] there is this story I think you can read
[1:29:25] it in in the book of Acts about Paul
[1:29:29] Paul
[1:29:33] was
[1:29:35] to meet I think the king that the king
[1:29:38] Agrippa on the other side
[1:29:40] but before then
[1:29:43] when they started going they were in the
[1:29:46] ship you can catch the story properly in
[1:29:48] the in the in the Bible
[1:29:51] there were problems in the ship
[1:29:56] yeah now as it was wrecking yeah Paul
[1:30:01] encouraged his people fear not why
[1:30:04] because the promise
[1:30:07] he knew
[1:30:08] he was to meet with the King on the
[1:30:10] other side by the king or whoever he was
[1:30:13] to meet he was to meet so if the promise
[1:30:17] that we have in our God is there
[1:30:22] if the promise is there
[1:30:24] then let us look at the promise
[1:30:27] [Laughter]
[1:30:30] let us look has looked there promise
[1:30:34] so if the promise is there
[1:30:38] no matter the circumstances
[1:30:42] let it come let let the circumstances
[1:30:45] come but as long as the promise is there
[1:30:51] God will not allow his purpose to be
[1:30:55] defeated
[1:30:56] and he has people today
[1:31:00] if I'm not one of them
[1:31:03] Lord may he help that person that
[1:31:06] brother or that sister to know that the
[1:31:10] promise is there for him or for her
[1:31:16] can it happen
[1:31:19] yes
[1:31:20] the promise is there
[1:31:23] he will have a pride
[1:31:26] yeah the promise is God will have a
[1:31:31] pride
[1:31:33] where
[1:31:37] in USA
[1:31:39] in Asia
[1:31:43] God will have a pride
[1:31:45] where is she
[1:31:49] so as long as he came
[1:31:54] so that he can write with you
[1:31:58] then
[1:32:01] if he's the one who called you you can
[1:32:04] challenge him
[1:32:06] you can also challenge him
[1:32:08] say Lord
[1:32:10] I don't want to be a hypocrite
[1:32:14] I don't want to waste your time like
[1:32:17] that brother prayed let me not waste
[1:32:19] your time
[1:32:20] yeah
[1:32:22] and let me not waste my time
[1:32:25] I want an assurance
[1:32:29] I want to know that I know I know and I
[1:32:32] know
[1:32:33] that my redeemer leave it
[1:32:38] he's in the boat
[1:32:42] he's in the pot
[1:32:44] can you wake him up let us stand sorry
[1:32:53] I hope the next Minister will pick it up
[1:32:55] from there so that
[1:32:57] he's in the pot
[1:33:00] oh my
[1:33:03] because he Because He Lives I confess
[1:33:06] tomorrow
[1:33:10] you know that he lives then you confess
[1:33:12] tomorrow fear is gone give me that give
[1:33:15] us that song I don't know how to sing it

[1:33:29] I confess tomorrow
[1:33:32] if you know he's in the boat then you

[1:36:07] the only way fear can be gone
[1:36:12] take that book
[1:36:14] fear only fears that open book
