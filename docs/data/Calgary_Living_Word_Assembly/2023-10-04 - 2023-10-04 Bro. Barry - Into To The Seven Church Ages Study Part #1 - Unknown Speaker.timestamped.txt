[10:05] him with enough time as we go to him
[10:07] gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[10:10] tonight we just are so thankful
[10:13] Lord that you are the same yesterday
[10:15] today and forever
[10:17] Lord Jesus while we would gather
[10:19] together here tonight
[10:29] many times it can feel so
[10:32] burdensome just to come to church
[10:36] but father we know that where two or
[10:38] three are gathered together in your name
[10:40] that you're there
[10:41] in their midst
[10:43] and Lord Jesus tonight we just want to
[10:46] thank you for coming here because Lord
[10:48] we know that we're gathered together in
[10:51] your name
[10:52] we're not gathered together in the name
[10:54] of Calgary Living Word
[10:56] we're not gathered together in the name
[10:58] of a board or the name of an assembly
[11:01] but we're gathered together in the name
[11:02] above every name the name of the Lord
[11:05] Jesus Christ
[11:07] the name of almighty God the name that
[11:10] you chose for yourself Lord Jesus father
[11:14] not as a father and not not a son or or
[11:17] just a holy ghost but the Lord Jesus
[11:20] Christ personal
[11:22] the personal pronoun father we're so

[11:34] our midst father we know that we don't
[11:37] come here to see you because you're in

[11:41] you with us and father when we bring you
[11:43] with us we know that we bring our licks
[11:46] of fire and those licks of fire are
[11:48] really truly portions of that Pillar of
[11:50] Fire Lord and father we're not here to
[11:53] play church tonight we're here to gather
[11:55] together and assemble ourselves father
[11:58] even more so as we see that day
[12:00] approaching because we know that one of
[12:02] these days oh Father all that the church
[12:05] ages have thought about and preached
[12:07] about all of the people who laid down
[12:09] their lives for this gospel is for the
[12:11] culmination of this father Lord the
[12:14] rapturing of your bride the taking away

[12:30] this service father
[12:32] Lord we want to hear from you we don't
[12:34] want to hear from a man
[12:36] father we just pray that every word
[12:38] that's spoken Lord Jesus would be

[12:43] would recognize that when we gather
[12:45] together this way in your name that you
[12:47] are here to speak to us father not just

[14:52] mind and one Accord
[14:54] singing
[14:56] you're bound to hear from heaven
[14:58] when the minister walks in and
[15:00] that's what's going on
[15:03] it's tremendous
[15:05] I just would like to invite you tonight
[15:07] to turn with me in the Book of
[15:08] Revelation
[15:10] we're going to begin our study in uh
[15:15] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[15:19] so just a couple of scriptures before we
[15:21] get too far
[15:24] Revelations chapter 1 verse 1.
[15:33] and then Malachi 4.
[15:43] Revelations 1 verse 1.
[15:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:50] which God gave unto him
[15:54] to show unto his servants things which
[15:58] must shortly come to pass
[16:01] and he sent and signified it by his
[16:03] Angel unto his servant John
[16:06] who bear record of the word of God and
[16:09] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[16:11] all things that he saw
[16:14] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[16:17] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[16:19] those things which are written therein
[16:23] for the time is at hand
[16:26] let's just turn over to Malachi
[16:30] for
[16:38] we'll just read the very familiar
[16:40] scripture of verse 5 and 6.
[16:44] Malachi chapter 4.
[16:51] verse 5.
[16:53] says behold I will send you Elijah the
[16:56] prophet
[16:57] before the coming of the great and
[16:59] Dreadful day of the Lord
[17:02] and he shall turn the heart of the
[17:03] fathers to the children
[17:05] in the heart of the children to their
[17:07] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[17:09] with a curse
[17:11] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[17:13] Father we thank you for your word amen
[17:16] thank you Lord that you've given us
[17:18] Revelation Lord as we've read about him
[17:21] revelation
[17:23] father we never ever want to take it for
[17:26] granted or take it lightly father when
[17:28] we read your word we know that it's
[17:30] actually not us speaking it's you
[17:32] speaking through us
[17:35] and father we're so thankful for this
[17:37] word we just cherish it and we just ask
[17:39] that Lord you would take us by the hand
[17:41] tonight father and walk with us along
[17:43] the way and that you would speak to us
[17:45] father and through us that we would hear
[17:48] from you tonight
[17:49] we just ask all these things now in
[17:51] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[17:54] bless you tonight you may be seated
[17:58] I
[18:00] just wanted to
[18:02] announce remind us that we have brother
[18:04] Danny del mundo who will be here this
[18:06] weekend and uh we'll have two Services
[18:09] Saturday night six o'clock Sunday
[18:11] morning regular time 10 o'clock and I'm
[18:14] sure it will be a wonderful time around
[18:17] the things of the lord we do have a new
[18:19] schedule for October events
[18:23] uh we'll have it up on the website and
[18:26] uh
[18:27] sorry I just feel a little nervous
[18:28] tonight it's kind of a strange thing but
[18:30] I'm certainly thankful to be uh doing
[18:33] this I know what's going on it's a
[18:36] spiritual battle and it's it's a good
[18:38] thing because I don't think the devil
[18:40] wants us doing this and
[18:43] that's a good thing
[18:44] because that's exactly what we're going
[18:46] to do
[18:47] exactly what the devil doesn't want us
[18:49] to do
[18:50] we're going to get right into this book
[18:52] there's so much in here that I think is
[18:55] so pertinent for a Believer and we'll
[18:58] just see what the Lord will do as I
[19:01] mentioned before
[19:02] um we have more books I think I said
[19:05] they were coming but for anybody who
[19:07] needs one there are more seven Church
[19:10] age books the exposition of the seven
[19:12] Church ages it's the one that's produced
[19:14] uh
[19:17] produced by brother George Smith
[19:18] Believers International is who it's
[19:21] produced by and he has inserted the
[19:24] actual Bible verses where brother
[19:27] Branham in the original version The Blue
[19:29] Book he actually just made reference to
[19:31] the scripture and this book actually
[19:34] contains the printed scriptures so it's
[19:36] it's actually quite handy because you
[19:39] don't have to get a Bible and go on
[19:40] reference you can actually see the
[19:42] scripture right there so if anybody has
[19:43] a desire for one of those books we
[19:46] certainly have more just let me know
[19:50] um
[19:51] I think it's a I think it's an amazing
[19:54] book I could give you a little bit of a
[19:56] testimony myself my first introduction
[19:59] to the message of the hour was actually
[20:01] uh exposition of the seven Church ages
[20:04] that that was my very first introduction
[20:08] um of any sort of what we would call
[20:10] message material and uh I I mean I was
[20:13] 100 in the world and had a desire for
[20:17] God but didn't really understand very
[20:21] much about God I just felt like church
[20:24] was a business and people treated it
[20:27] that way and it was just a money-making
[20:29] scheme and that was my idea of
[20:32] Christianity and probably it was formed
[20:35] by what I saw on TV because of course I
[20:38] watched TV when I was in the world and
[20:40] saw all of the mainstream
[20:43] what do you call them the the maybe the
[20:45] mega preachers the TV Ministries and it
[20:48] seemed like the only thing they did was
[20:51] call on money they didn't actually
[20:52] preach any word and I I would just say
[20:55] yeah that's Christianity but
[20:58] I had the uh I had the ability to meet
[21:01] someone who was a real believer and uh
[21:04] through that experience was able to get
[21:06] my hands on a seven Church age book an
[21:10] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[21:11] I would like to say that that actually
[21:13] was the opportunity for the Heavens to
[21:15] open and the angels to sing and uh
[21:19] me to have a conversion in my life
[21:21] because I read that book but that wasn't
[21:23] the case I opened it up and I read the
[21:25] first few words of the first chapter and
[21:28] I just be honest with you I I thought
[21:30] this is weird man I don't know what to
[21:33] make of this and I put it down and
[21:35] didn't look at it for years later for
[21:38] years
[21:39] I uh it was it was an interesting thing
[21:42] but I think the Lord just knows exactly
[21:45] what we need and he knows exactly when
[21:47] we need it and uh he he allows things to
[21:50] happen very specifically in our lives we
[21:53] can feel like we're hiccuping along and
[21:55] stumbling along and some people maybe
[21:57] feel like they're very driven and and
[21:59] very deliberate about every single
[22:01] maneuver they make but just be clear
[22:03] about one thing we're only doing what
[22:05] the father wants done we're only living
[22:07] Our Lives the way that he wants us to
[22:10] live them even if we're 100 calculated
[22:13] or we're stumbling and groping in
[22:15] darkness we're doing exactly what the
[22:17] Lord wants us to do and we won't do
[22:18] anything else
[22:20] his will will be accomplished in our
[22:21] lives but I know I was stumbling around
[22:24] and groping in darkness there and that
[22:26] was my first introduction to this book
[22:29] and it's a very uh maybe call it a
[22:32] difficult read if you're not a reader
[22:34] and it can be really uh almost
[22:36] burdensome for some people it was for me
[22:39] when I first started looking at it but
[22:41] when you actually start to understand
[22:42] about the message of the hour and you
[22:44] start to understand who this prophet in
[22:48] our day is and the word that is actually
[22:51] brought to us you you you start to
[22:54] realize there's a lot that's inside this
[22:57] book that that really does something to
[23:00] the believer now I'm probably preaching
[23:02] to the choir but I'm just going to take
[23:03] my time with this book I'm not going to
[23:06] rush it and we might spend a couple of
[23:08] services just on the introduction and if
[23:11] you were to read the introduction you
[23:12] could probably read it if you're a good
[23:13] reader you'd probably read it in about a
[23:16] minute and a half and you'd be done I
[23:17] think when you listen to it on on the
[23:20] message app it's roughly two minutes and
[23:23] that's all there is for that but there's
[23:25] so much that said just even in the
[23:27] introduction that is uh so pertinent um
[23:31] just the overview of it
[23:33] um pertaining to the the the Revelation
[23:35] or the exposition of the seven Church
[23:37] ages it's actually it's not just
[23:41] something that brother Branham came up
[23:43] with
[23:44] um he was inspired to preach it and it's
[23:47] all out of the word it's pertaining to
[23:48] Revelations chapter one up to
[23:51] Revelations chapter three
[23:54] um just before John gets invited to come
[23:56] up to heaven while he's on the Isle of
[23:58] Patmos for the testimony of Jesus and uh
[24:01] there is actually the explanation of of
[24:05] what John is going through in there and
[24:07] I'm sure we're all familiar with this
[24:08] but just to sort of do a really slow
[24:10] overview of of what what is actually in
[24:14] here brother Bradham he preached this
[24:16] series of the church ages in 196 d
[24:21] and I believe this book wasn't released
[24:22] until 1965 until the year that he
[24:25] actually went on to his reward but you
[24:29] could listen to all of the messages and
[24:31] if you've read the church age book if
[24:32] you've listened to the church age book
[24:34] how many knows that there is actually an
[24:36] audio version of the church age book
[24:38] that you can listen to does everybody
[24:39] know that
[24:40] if everybody doesn't know that I want to
[24:42] make sure that everybody does know that
[24:44] because you don't necessarily have to
[24:45] just read it you can put in headphones
[24:47] and press play and listen to someone
[24:50] narrate the the exposition of the seven
[24:53] Church ages and and the way the man
[24:55] reads it is very very clear and concise
[24:58] and some might even say it's a little
[25:00] bit dry but the word is there and and
[25:03] when you hear that word and you
[25:05] recognize that word it does something on
[25:07] the inside of the inside you can
[25:09] actually listen to it
[25:11] um the exposition of the seven Church
[25:13] ages read by someone it's narrated it's
[25:15] a narrated version but you can also
[25:17] listen to brother Branham preach
[25:21] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[25:23] in 1960 and when you know the exposition
[25:27] of the seven shirts is the book printed
[25:29] and you go back and you listen to the
[25:31] messages that he preaches you could just
[25:33] say Amen because it's exactly what is in
[25:36] there he just says it in different ways
[25:38] and and it's clarified uh a bit it's
[25:40] grammaratized brother Branham called it
[25:43] um when he actually put it into print
[25:45] when he put the book into print
[25:47] but speaking of this book specifically
[25:49] there's some people who would question
[25:51] the validity of this book and I I don't
[25:54] want to get into a debate with anyone
[25:56] about it whether they they believe it or
[25:58] not
[25:59] um I can only go off of what I've seen
[26:01] and what I've heard and I'm sure every
[26:03] one of us would be able to say the same
[26:04] thing and I think it's super important
[26:07] for us to know where we stand because if
[26:09] we're going to pick up some material and
[26:11] read a book we need to know exactly that
[26:14] we have the Holy Ghost and we can put it
[26:16] through the filter of the Holy Ghost
[26:17] when we read a book Satan is really Sly
[26:20] he's going to come to us
[26:22] in a present that's beautifully wrapped
[26:25] with a bow tie that's very sparkly he's
[26:29] going to come to us in Flowery things in
[26:31] really good ideas and theories but you
[26:34] know what if it doesn't line up with the
[26:36] word how will we know if it lines up
[26:38] with the word if we don't know the word
[26:41] that's the important thing and you know
[26:43] I believe it this way
[26:45] and maybe it would be debatable but I
[26:48] just think it's it's like this if if you
[26:51] haven't read the entire Bible I don't
[26:54] know how many people have or haven't I'm
[26:55] not going to ask the question you don't
[26:57] necessarily have to read the entire
[26:59] Bible you don't necessarily have to
[27:01] memorize good portions of the Bible it's
[27:04] very good to do the word of God says to
[27:07] eat the book but what my point is is the
[27:09] word of God also says that when he the
[27:12] spirit of truth comes he will lead you
[27:14] and guide you into all truth when you
[27:16] have the Holy Ghost in your life you can
[27:18] pick up anything and you will have the
[27:21] Holy Spirit tell you stop reading it or
[27:24] keep reading it
[27:25] Amen to it or no that's wrong there will
[27:29] be something inside of you that will
[27:31] resonate with what it is you're reading
[27:33] or whatever you're listening to
[27:35] so I'm not saying don't read your Bible
[27:37] I'm going to say eat the book and I
[27:39] would say eat every single bit of it
[27:41] every crumb of the Bible eat it all
[27:43] it'll do you good you might not get it
[27:45] the genealogy might just about kill you
[27:48] but just do it anyway it'll do something
[27:51] for you
[27:52] I was just saying mentally I was
[27:54] referring to mentally it will only give
[27:55] you life the word of God will only give
[27:57] you life forgive me for saying kill you
[28:00] the genealogy is very difficult that's
[28:03] the way to say it it's very difficult
[28:05] thing to get through
[28:07] but some people question the validity of
[28:09] this book The the exposition of the
[28:10] seven Church ages
[28:12] um the reason for it I believe is
[28:13] because one of the reasons maybe is
[28:15] because uh he had brother Branham had
[28:18] someone help him grammatize the book
[28:20] help him do all of the proper spelling
[28:23] and pronunciation and and setting it out
[28:25] properly so that it would be in a
[28:27] readable version
[28:30] um I know brother Brown was challenged
[28:31] many times in his ministry about how he
[28:34] would say things whether he would say
[28:35] Pulpit or pulpit and and different
[28:38] things and people go to theology school
[28:40] and they're taught all of these
[28:42] different things there's choruses that
[28:43] are are specializing in in being
[28:46] polished and acting a certain way and
[28:48] brother Branham he wasn't that way and
[28:51] so he had help putting it all together
[28:52] so that it would you know come together
[28:54] in in a book form that would be
[28:56] acceptable maybe by the masses but so
[28:59] some people would say that brother Lee
[29:01] Vale who was the teacher
[29:04] closest to brother Bradham at the time
[29:06] he was the one that actually put the
[29:09] book together that it wasn't brother
[29:10] Branham that did it and uh you know
[29:13] I think you have to draw your own
[29:15] conclusion with that whether it was
[29:17] another man that that did it or whether
[29:19] it was brother Bradham that did it see
[29:22] what that book says take a look at what
[29:24] that book says does it actually point to
[29:26] the word of God and if it does then just
[29:28] say Amen to it but if it doesn't then I
[29:31] think there's cause for concern maybe
[29:33] there's cause for a question or or maybe
[29:35] we can take away and say you know maybe
[29:37] I need to put it on the back burner and
[29:39] just leave it alone but if it actually
[29:41] refers to the word of God then say Amen
[29:44] to it I don't think you can actually
[29:45] refuse it if you have the Holy Ghost in
[29:47] your life there's something in there
[29:49] that drives you towards the word of God
[29:51] but whether some people question the
[29:53] validity of it or not is basically
[29:55] irrelevant to me and that's just my view
[29:58] but I would say if you have a question
[30:01] about it read it
[30:03] see if it resonates with the word of God
[30:07] so I'm sorry I'm I'm really taking my
[30:09] time with this I know there's some
[30:11] people maybe that don't have this book
[30:13] that could look at this online just for
[30:15] those people who are wondering in the
[30:16] audience I do get questions from people
[30:18] who are absolutely random individuals
[30:20] because we stream on YouTube there's
[30:23] other people that see it and there's
[30:25] people that have questions and it's
[30:27] interesting so as we go as we're
[30:30] recording I want to make sure that I'm
[30:31] I'm dealing with a one-room schoolhouse
[30:33] for the people that have never heard
[30:35] about it and and the people that could
[30:37] probably quote it or or preach it better
[30:39] than I could
[30:40] you know um for the people that say this
[30:42] wasn't brother bradham's book that uh
[30:44] you know
[30:46] this other brother
[30:47] grammaratized it and maybe changed the
[30:49] words and everything there's a brother
[30:51] that actually has the manuscript that
[30:54] was actually used to create this book
[30:56] and he has brother branham's uh writing
[31:00] in this book The manuscript that they
[31:02] use to actually edit this this book
[31:04] before they went to print and he said
[31:07] you know his family had it his family
[31:09] was really good friends with brotherly
[31:10] Vale and uh he said that brotherly Vale
[31:13] gave that book to his dad when he was
[31:16] young when they went to publishing
[31:18] because he didn't need it anymore he
[31:19] thought it would be a nice gift and so
[31:22] he has this book the transcripts of of
[31:24] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[31:26] that he said as a family we would have
[31:28] devotions and go through and see where
[31:29] brother Branham actually corrected and
[31:31] said no change this and alter that and
[31:33] he says every single page in there is
[31:35] edited by hand by the prophet so it's
[31:39] not something that's just one-sided
[31:41] about it being one man some other people
[31:43] would say you know this is Brother
[31:45] branham's book this is kind of where I
[31:46] went with it initially when I saw and I
[31:48] put it down I saw the there's a picture
[31:49] of the man inside with the with the halo
[31:52] over his head and we'd call it the
[31:53] pillar of fire and that's just what I
[31:55] saw it as when I I first saw it and I
[31:57] thought yeah this is another man's book
[31:58] and he's got a book and she's got a book
[32:01] and everybody's got a book in this world
[32:02] and and once you're published you're
[32:04] something right but you know it's not
[32:07] that case in in this book it's a
[32:09] different case this book is actually
[32:11] referring to the word of God this book
[32:13] is referring to the word of God for our
[32:15] day not just any day but but for our day
[32:19] and if again if there's any questions
[32:20] about whether this is valid according to
[32:23] the word of God just go ahead and read
[32:25] the book and see if it actually refers
[32:28] to scripture or if it's just a man's
[32:31] idea just slipped in the pages and and
[32:33] somehow now there's this strange thing
[32:35] going on
[32:37] but you know I just love how brother
[32:38] Branham he he explains it from the very
[32:41] beginning
[32:42] but all we have to do is read it we know
[32:45] that it points to the Bible and here's
[32:47] the thing that really I think is
[32:49] probably the most critical part we need
[32:51] to establish whether the Bible is the
[32:54] absolute or not
[32:55] and if the Bible is the absolute then we
[32:58] have a conversation but if we come to a
[33:01] place where we say you know maybe the
[33:02] Bible is just a a debatable book it's
[33:05] not necessarily the absolute then I
[33:07] don't know if we have a whole lot to
[33:09] talk about because we could be talking
[33:11] about different things right we could be
[33:13] speaking absolutely different languages
[33:15] but if we can agree that the Bible is
[33:17] actually valid that it is the absolute
[33:19] then we we've got somewhere to go we've
[33:21] got a our very first foothold maybe on
[33:24] the ladder going upwards with this with
[33:26] this word so tonight I just want to take
[33:29] a real slow look at the uh the beginning
[33:32] of this book
[33:34] and I just want to take these scriptures
[33:36] and just sort of set the the the base
[33:39] for it out of Revelations chapter one
[33:42] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:43] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[33:47] servants the things which must shortly
[33:50] come to pass and he sent and signify it
[33:52] by his Angel unto his servant John I
[33:54] think it's so beautiful we talked about
[33:55] this a little while ago how we have had
[33:57] it sent and signified To Us by an Angel
[34:00] this message of the hour this book that
[34:03] we're looking at is actually speaking
[34:05] about Revelation this book is based on
[34:08] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[34:11] so this is very relevant to the Book of
[34:13] Revelation
[34:15] I just think it's it's amazing you know
[34:18] uh we could just go on and read verse
[34:19] two here who bear record of the word of
[34:21] God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[34:23] and of all things that he saw this is
[34:26] where we come into play in in verse
[34:28] three blessed is he that readeth and
[34:30] they that hear the words of this
[34:32] prophecy and keep those things which are
[34:35] written therein for the time is at hand
[34:39] it's such a beautiful thing we don't
[34:41] even have to read it ourselves all we
[34:43] have to do is listen to it brother
[34:44] Branham talks about it in the book we'll
[34:46] get into it eventually but he talks
[34:48] about how you know there was a time
[34:49] where it was just a priest that read the
[34:51] book because most people were illiterate
[34:52] they didn't have the ability to read so
[34:54] the priest would open the book and he
[34:56] would read the book and precious words
[34:58] would come forth out of their mouths and
[35:02] it would actually do something for them
[35:04] but let's just take take and look at the
[35:07] introduction here we'll we'll start with
[35:09] this
[35:10] um out of the exposition of the seven
[35:12] Church ages this is the part that I was
[35:13] talking about that's really uh like a
[35:15] minute and a half of reading and uh Lord
[35:17] willing will take an hour and
[35:21] some
[35:22] and actually talk about it maybe 45
[35:24] minutes I don't want to keep us late
[35:27] um do we have it up there
[35:31] there we go
[35:33] so brother Bradham he says here in in
[35:36] the first paragraph though this volume
[35:38] will concern itself with various major
[35:41] doctrines
[35:43] such as the godhead water baptism Etc
[35:46] found in Revelation chapters one through
[35:49] three
[35:50] its main theme is the setting forth of a
[35:54] detailed study of the seven Church ages
[35:58] I myself when I first heard about this
[36:00] had no idea there was even seven Church
[36:03] ages I didn't realize that there was
[36:06] seven churches and I didn't even realize
[36:08] there was a need for the seven Church
[36:11] ages are we having troubles bringing
[36:12] that up
[36:15] sorry
[36:22] technical difficulties
[36:24] it happens
[36:26] there we go
[36:29] thanks guys
[36:31] brother random says this is necessary in
[36:33] order to study and understand the rest
[36:36] of Revelation
[36:38] myself when I was growing up I was drawn
[36:40] to the Book of Revelation I thought it
[36:42] was a an intriguing book there's so much
[36:44] in there the the last book of the Bible
[36:47] how does all of the Bible culminate in
[36:50] that last book and and I'm so I was so
[36:54] thrilled when I finally started to dig
[36:55] into the this book The the seven Church
[36:58] ages to hear Brother Branham say that
[37:01] it's necessary in order to study and
[37:03] understand the rest of the Revelation
[37:04] for out of the ages comes the seals
[37:09] and out of the seals comes the trumpets
[37:12] and out of the trumpets come the vials
[37:15] and so what he's talking about in there
[37:18] is further on from Revelations 4 5 6 and
[37:23] 7. that's that's what he's referring to
[37:25] there that's pretty much jam-packed in
[37:27] just a couple of words there's so much
[37:29] in there but out of out of the
[37:33] what's going on here out of the ages
[37:35] comes the seals out of the seals comes
[37:37] the trumpets out of the trumpets come
[37:38] the files like the first burst of a
[37:41] Roman Candle
[37:43] the church Ages come forth with a mighty
[37:46] initial illumination
[37:47] without which there could be no further
[37:50] light
[37:53] but once the Brilliance of the seven
[37:55] Church ages is given
[37:58] by divine revelation
[38:01] light upon light follows until the whole
[38:04] of the Revelation opens up wide before
[38:07] our wandering eyes
[38:09] I just love how brother Branham sets it
[38:12] out here
[38:13] and he says like the first burst of a
[38:15] Roman Candle the church Ages come forth
[38:18] with a mighty illumination how does this
[38:21] happen brothers and sisters the only way
[38:24] it happens is in the next paragraph we
[38:27] sought once the Brilliance of the seven
[38:29] Church ages is given by divine
[38:31] revelation
[38:33] and you know the only way that we're
[38:34] going to get divine revelation in our
[38:36] lives is to get the Holy Ghost
[38:38] and that's the critical Factor without
[38:40] the Holy Ghost this book isn't going to
[38:42] mean very much to us
[38:44] but I believe that we could read this
[38:46] book and it could Inspire us to say wait
[38:48] a second there's something to this maybe
[38:51] I don't fully understand what's going on
[38:53] but it's pointing to the word of God and
[38:56] and even though this man's picture is in
[38:58] there and it could look like a man's
[39:00] idea of everything that's going on he's
[39:02] talking about these doctrines and things
[39:04] maybe there's something in here that
[39:06] could really be of value to me
[39:09] and once it happens brothers and sisters
[39:11] once there is a divine revelation given
[39:15] to the believer It Goes Forth like the
[39:19] burst of a Roman Candle
[39:21] are we familiar with Roman candles we
[39:23] know what they are
[39:24] brother Bradham refers to them everyone
[39:25] knows what they are they're like a stick
[39:28] and they have the balls of fire inside
[39:30] there and when you light one you light
[39:32] the end of it and it shoots a ball and
[39:35] then it shoots another ball and then it
[39:37] shoots another ball and it just keeps
[39:38] doing that and it's usually done at
[39:40] night and when you're not expecting it
[39:42] it's quite surprising when it happens
[39:44] but it's important to recognize that you
[39:47] can be in complete darkness and as
[39:50] you're reading this in scriptural terms
[39:54] spiritual terms in complete darkness
[39:57] suddenly what happens is there's a burst
[39:59] that goes forth and it's a bright light
[40:01] and it illuminates it it shines like a
[40:04] flare and you can see suddenly you can
[40:06] see so much that you couldn't see before
[40:08] that's what brother Branham is referring
[40:10] to here like the burst of a Roman Candle
[40:12] the first burst the church Ages come
[40:15] forth with a mighty initial illumination
[40:18] without which there could be no further
[40:21] light
[40:22] I think that's amazing if we look at the
[40:25] message of the hour how how could that
[40:28] apply to this
[40:29] he says without understanding this there
[40:32] could be no further light
[40:34] but once the Brilliance of the seven
[40:36] Church ages is given by divine
[40:39] revelation light upon light follows
[40:42] until the whole of Revelation opens wide
[40:46] before our wandering eyes
[40:48] when I read that the first time I
[40:51] thought wow I I've always been
[40:54] fascinated with the Book of Revelation
[40:55] and and all the Mysteries and the Book
[40:58] of symbols that we're familiar with but
[41:00] when I heard that I thought wow there's
[41:03] an opportunity to actually understand
[41:04] this
[41:06] and we know that in the denominational
[41:07] World many times people shy away from
[41:10] this they say no we're not qualified to
[41:12] talk about this nobody has the
[41:13] interpretation of it but you know if you
[41:16] can actually believe if you if you have
[41:19] the ability to receive the word if you
[41:21] have ears to hear what the spirit saith
[41:24] unto the church you can receive the idea
[41:27] that God sent a prophet
[41:29] and when that happens
[41:31] that changes everything because the word
[41:34] that he speaks is in his own
[41:36] when you hear thus saith the Lord It's
[41:39] not a man speaking
[41:41] that's God speaking
[41:42] through a man
[41:44] to all men
[41:47] and when that happens when we can get
[41:49] that initial Revelation light upon light
[41:51] follows until the whole of Revelation
[41:53] opens up why before warning us no we're
[41:55] not talking about the Roman Candle even
[41:56] though we use that as an example we're
[41:58] not talking about that we're talking
[41:59] about the illumination by the spirit of
[42:02] the word of God in our lives and and
[42:04] specifically in important doctrinal
[42:07] things like the godhead
[42:09] like water baptism
[42:11] to understand that if you get baptized
[42:14] in in a trinitarian baptism you're just
[42:16] coming according to another recipe
[42:18] you're not coming according to the
[42:20] recipe of the word of God that says that
[42:22] if you get baptized in the name of the
[42:25] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[42:26] your sins you shall receive the gift of
[42:28] the Holy Ghost how can you go contrary
[42:31] to the recipe and get the right results
[42:34] we've talked about this in the past
[42:35] we've all probably heard it for those
[42:37] people who cook or bake if you've ever
[42:39] made anything in your life you cannot
[42:42] take sugar out of a recipe and just
[42:45] throw salt in in its place and say it'll
[42:47] be okay it will not be okay sometimes
[42:49] it'll cook exactly the same
[42:52] but other times it won't even cook the
[42:54] same but goodness sakes if it cooked the
[42:56] same and you tasted it it would just
[42:58] about put you on the floor if you're
[42:59] expecting sweet and you get that much
[43:01] salt it would be terrible
[43:04] if you don't cook according to the
[43:05] recipe it can look exactly right
[43:09] but you won't get the right results
[43:12] but if you cook according to the recipe
[43:15] even the first time Trier the so long as
[43:18] you follow it to the letter
[43:19] you can get the right results
[43:22] and some people would call it beginner's
[43:24] luck isn't it amazing with the word of
[43:26] God you don't have to worry about
[43:27] beginner's luck all you have to do is
[43:29] come as a little child and unless you do
[43:32] come as a little child you will have no
[43:34] part in the Kingdom
[43:38] but light upon light follows elimination
[43:40] of the word
[43:42] upon elimination of the word the
[43:45] revelation of the word you know talking
[43:48] about revelation we can talk about the
[43:50] the the very specific story where Jesus
[43:55] said to his disciples you know who do
[43:58] men say that I am
[44:00] what's going on what's the word on the
[44:01] street guys who who does man say that I
[44:03] am and some said you know John or some
[44:08] said Elias and some said the prophets
[44:09] and and we know that Jesus he said okay
[44:12] that's fine that's what they're saying
[44:13] out there but what do you say
[44:16] who do you say that I the son of man am
[44:20] you know I I know that there is no time
[44:23] frame in there is there it doesn't say
[44:25] they waited for 15 minutes or they went
[44:28] away and prayed about it or had a study
[44:31] they didn't do any of that it just says
[44:33] that Peter said Thou Art the Christ the
[44:35] son of the Living God
[44:39] and what did Jesus say
[44:41] light upon light
[44:43] came forward and showed you that John
[44:46] that that wasn't that wasn't something
[44:48] that man taught you you didn't learn
[44:50] that in school it wasn't something that
[44:52] you pulled out of your pocket as a
[44:53] handbook to say what's what what do we
[44:56] do in this case here what what does the
[44:58] denomination say we should do no it was
[45:01] a divine revelation
[45:04] and we know that brother Bradham says
[45:06] here but once the Brilliance of the
[45:07] seven Church ages is given by divine
[45:10] revelation light upon light follows
[45:13] until the whole of the Revelation opens
[45:16] wide before our wandering eyes I want to
[45:18] say this too brothers and sisters every
[45:19] scripture
[45:20] is is is is is I I uh maybe I'll stop I
[45:25] don't want to refer to this as scripture
[45:26] it can sound like I am let's just be
[45:28] clear I would never want to say that
[45:30] what brother Bradham says is scripture
[45:32] his words here
[45:34] what I what I wanted to say was every
[45:36] scripture can have a compound meaning
[45:39] and compound Revelation what I want to
[45:41] say is what brother Branham is saying
[45:43] here can have a compound meaning and a
[45:45] compound Revelation because I believe
[45:47] he's speaking directly about the Book of
[45:49] Revelation but I also believe he's
[45:51] speaking directly about Revelation
[45:54] divine revelation from God the
[45:57] interpretation of the word to the
[45:59] believer individually and we know that's
[46:01] the new birth but light upon life
[46:03] follows until the whole of the
[46:05] Revelation opens wide before I wanting
[46:07] ice and I want to say this the whole of
[46:09] the Revelation the whole of the word of
[46:11] God the whole understanding comes to us
[46:15] by revelation after revelation after
[46:18] wave of understanding we start to
[46:20] understand all these different things
[46:22] and people might say like what I would
[46:24] say like serpent seed I know myself when
[46:26] I first started to really engage the
[46:29] word of God engage God as God just to
[46:32] say to him okay if you're a God maybe
[46:34] through this message of the hour then
[46:36] just be God to me
[46:38] show me that you're God
[46:40] and you know what he will if you want
[46:42] him to he will
[46:44] and he'll do it in such a way that you
[46:46] will know
[46:47] if it's not for the public masses we
[46:49] know that we live in the in in the
[46:51] mysterious time of the third poll and we
[46:53] can get into the deep doctrinal stuff I
[46:55] don't want I don't want to do that
[46:56] tonight we can do it it's easy to do if
[46:59] we really want to but but I think we
[47:01] need to know our ABCs and the ABCs are
[47:04] understanding where we stand who we are
[47:07] getting the fact that if we've got the
[47:09] Holy Ghost then we'll get this
[47:10] Revelation and the Revelation when it
[47:12] comes in our lives it'll just keep
[47:13] compounding in our lives and I don't
[47:16] think we ever stop learning by
[47:18] revelation
[47:20] some people might say I know the the
[47:22] scripture I remember brother Ken
[47:24] teaching it very clearly he said that
[47:25] the Pharisees and the Sadducees they
[47:27] would have Scrolls that would be the
[47:29] Bible that would be their book
[47:32] and they knew it so well they probably
[47:34] even do today that they could take a pin
[47:36] and stick it through that role that
[47:38] scroll and they would be able to unroll
[47:40] it and tell you before they unroll it or
[47:43] as they unroll it exactly what
[47:45] scriptures that pin pierced
[47:48] those guys knew their scripture
[47:52] we know our scripture
[47:53] I would say I know my scripture to an
[47:55] extent but not like that
[47:58] but I rely on the Lord
[48:00] I rely on him we we suffer from a
[48:03] condition called Soft living here and I
[48:06] know that we all do because we all eat
[48:08] the same food some people can go and get
[48:10] the the organic stuff but you know what
[48:12] brother batam talked about it very
[48:13] clearly back in the in the 60s and the
[48:15] 50s about how the food is Tainted the
[48:17] food that we eat is not normal food this
[48:19] is not the food that we're going to have
[48:21] in the Millennium but we have the word
[48:23] of God that's why we pray for our food
[48:26] when we eat our food if we pray for our
[48:28] food God will bless it to our bodies
[48:31] but let's get back to talking about
[48:33] Revelation that's where we're at tonight
[48:34] talking about the exposition of the
[48:36] seven Church ages the introduction of it
[48:38] brother Branham saying that light upon
[48:39] light follows until the whole of the
[48:41] Revelation opens up wide before our
[48:43] wandering eyes not just the Book of
[48:44] Revelation but the entire Revelation the
[48:47] entire divine revelation about there
[48:49] being a prophet in our day about there
[48:51] being a message of the hour and what
[48:53] that message of the hour is just repent
[48:55] and just come unto the the Lord
[48:57] according to the word for our day get
[49:00] back to the word is what brother Bradham
[49:02] talks about in the church age book just
[49:04] get back in line and he goes on to say
[49:07] and we edified and purified by its
[49:11] Spirit are made ready for his glorious
[49:14] appearing how many want to be ready for
[49:16] his glorious appearing
[49:20] I think I I just yeah does something to
[49:23] me I think yeah man I want to be ready
[49:24] for his glorious appearing and we know
[49:26] that even looking at the message of the
[49:28] hour brother Branham said his appearing
[49:30] is now
[49:32] the coming is yet but his appearing is
[49:35] now
[49:36] but he also went on to say you know what
[49:38] he's here
[49:40] so I'm not going to get into all of that
[49:42] tonight I just want to just really focus
[49:45] on this I can I can go a hundred ways
[49:48] with this but I I apologize if it seems
[49:51] like I am a little maybe unsettled with
[49:54] it because I do feel a bit like a kid in
[49:56] a candy shop I don't know if I'm a
[49:58] teacher per se but just to look at this
[50:01] introduction it's so amazing and it can
[50:04] be so easy to just turn it on and just
[50:07] let it play and a minute and a half
[50:08] later it's over and now you want to get
[50:10] into something else but if we can just
[50:13] take some time and really think about
[50:15] what he's saying in this introduction
[50:17] what this book really has inside of it
[50:20] I'm not trying to glorify the book and
[50:21] say it's as fantastic as the word of God
[50:24] because this is the absolute right here
[50:26] brothers and sisters this is the
[50:28] absolute the word of God is what we
[50:31] stake it all on
[50:33] brother Branham I was looking for the
[50:34] quote in the back I'll bring it he says
[50:36] that if you can't take my word for it
[50:37] take the word of God
[50:39] some people would say no no you got to
[50:41] take the word of the prophet
[50:44] but that's actually wrong that's an
[50:46] error
[50:47] because no man will ever be able to
[50:50] share his glory he won't share it God
[50:53] will not share Jesus Christ who is God
[50:55] will not share his glory with any human
[50:57] being ever
[51:00] and we know that because John you know
[51:02] in the Book of Revelation later on two
[51:04] times tried to Bow Down and Worship an
[51:06] angel
[51:07] and the angel said nope
[51:09] don't worship me worship God I'm I'm of
[51:12] your fellow brethren
[51:14] prophets I think it's interesting
[51:16] because some people have said that you
[51:18] know one of those was actually brother
[51:20] Branham has anybody ever heard that
[51:22] before
[51:24] it's an interesting discussion
[51:26] and uh there's another one in there in
[51:28] Revelation we'll get into where uh
[51:30] brother brownie actually has a quote
[51:31] that says he was there and uh
[51:35] I'll get into it later but there's some
[51:38] super fascinating stuff with this and
[51:40] tonight we're just laying in the
[51:41] background setting the foundation for
[51:43] this study as we go it's going to be a
[51:45] long one
[51:46] I hope that we can uh endure we'll maybe
[51:49] take some breaks along the way but we'll
[51:51] continue on with it you know um brother
[51:54] bradhamy says here and we edified and
[51:56] purified by its Spirit are made ready
[51:59] for his glorious appearing even our Lord
[52:01] and savior the one true God
[52:05] Jesus Christ
[52:07] he says this composition is set forth in
[52:10] the first person as it is a message from
[52:13] my heart to the hearts of the people
[52:18] I think that's beautiful as well he's
[52:21] saying that that's from him his heart
[52:23] directly to anyone that would read it
[52:26] particular pains have been taken to
[52:28] capitalize all names and titles
[52:31] and nouns and pronouns
[52:34] Etc
[52:35] I could probably preach a sermon right
[52:38] there
[52:39] it's interesting though because
[52:42] this is such a vital word these are
[52:46] vital words Even in our day
[52:48] to understand that so many people
[52:50] understand nouns and pronouns and and
[52:54] how important it is how big of a deal
[52:57] are they making of nouns and pronouns in
[52:59] this world today brothers and sisters
[53:02] right and so many times in the
[53:04] denominational World it doesn't matter
[53:06] we can have three it's fine we'll just
[53:08] be plural
[53:09] but what we have here is a prophet of
[53:11] God saying no no no no no we need to be
[53:13] very absolutely specific with this and
[53:16] know that we've got the right
[53:18] pronunciation for the nouns and the
[53:20] pronouns and I'm sure we all know what
[53:22] those are many people will know better
[53:24] than I will I I don't claim to be an
[53:26] expert in that at all brother Tom Ernest
[53:29] was very clear with me on that one time
[53:34] God bless him
[53:36] particular pains have been taken to
[53:38] capitalize all names and titles nouns
[53:40] pronouns Etc that relate to godhead and
[53:44] also the words Bible
[53:46] scripture and the word as we hold this
[53:50] only proper in speaking of the majesty
[53:54] and person of God and His holy word
[53:58] I think that's just magnificent right
[54:00] there he he makes it very clear that
[54:02] this is about the Lord Jesus Christ this
[54:05] is about God this is pointing directly
[54:07] to the word of God this is not just a
[54:09] man's Revelation where it's something
[54:11] that we're going to try and say that you
[54:13] know he gave me some glasses and I can
[54:16] see something a little bit differently
[54:17] or maybe I ate something and had a dream
[54:21] and it gave me an opportunity to see
[54:23] something different we know that brother
[54:24] Branham said that dreams are secondary
[54:26] they're not primary the the prophet's
[54:29] word the prophetic utterance the word of
[54:31] God is primary
[54:34] dreams are always secondary
[54:37] but you know
[54:38] um I just think it's amazing how he just
[54:40] makes this exactly about the Lord Jesus
[54:42] Christ the the the the the god that we
[54:46] serve the one and only
[54:48] Elohim he goes on to say I pray this
[54:51] blessing of God upon each reader
[54:55] is beautiful
[54:57] and may elimination by the spirit of God
[55:02] be each one special portion I think we
[55:04] go to the end of the church age book and
[55:06] and read the very last part of it
[55:08] because he says in there that he's not
[55:10] interested in trying to create a
[55:13] following he's not interested in trying
[55:15] to set up a denomination I'm just
[55:16] paraphrasing it what he wants is for
[55:18] everyone to have their own relationship
[55:20] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:22] he starts the book with it and and ends
[55:25] the book with it and you know it's right
[55:27] in line with the word of God I pray a
[55:30] blessing of God upon each reader you
[55:33] know verse 3 we we read in Revelations
[55:35] chapter one blessed is he that readeth
[55:37] and they that hear the words of this
[55:39] prophecy
[55:41] here we have brother Bradham saying I
[55:43] pray the blessing of God upon each
[55:45] reader and may elimination by what
[55:48] elimination by
[55:49] William Branham
[55:51] elimination by the message of the hour
[55:55] elimination by a church
[55:58] or a group or some minister
[56:02] elimination by the spirit of God
[56:06] be each one special portion
[56:09] brothers and sisters that is the
[56:11] critical Factor right there
[56:14] with the each each and every every
[56:15] individual we have got to have our own
[56:18] spiritual walk with the Lord we have to
[56:20] have the spirit of God be each one
[56:23] special portion and it's not just a
[56:25] special portion of the of the spirit of
[56:28] God that we get even though it is a
[56:29] special portion of God himself the Lord
[56:32] Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost
[56:35] if we repent and get baptized in the
[56:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[56:39] mission of our sins then we shall
[56:41] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost or
[56:43] our special portion each one special
[56:46] portion that's how we get it
[56:48] but the only way we're going to get the
[56:50] true baptism of the Holy Ghost is to
[56:51] come according to the word of God it's
[56:55] got to be according to the word of God
[56:56] it cannot be according to uh a man's
[56:59] interpretation from Nyasia Rome
[57:02] it can't be if we do that we're actually
[57:06] putting salt in in the cake instead of
[57:08] sugar
[57:09] and it's going to look exactly the same
[57:11] it's going to be just for all intents
[57:13] and purposes it's going to look great
[57:15] and you might even have it smell good
[57:17] when it bakes but boy as soon as you
[57:19] taste it it's going to be nasty
[57:23] you know uh talking about the scripture
[57:26] tonight in in Malachi 4 verse 5 and and
[57:31] Revelations 1 1-3 I really wanted to
[57:35] just take from Malachi 4 verse 5 with
[57:39] our last few minutes tonight and just
[57:41] remind us and and and underline and bold
[57:45] it for everyone behold I will send you
[57:48] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[57:51] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[57:53] So In This Book of Malachi we know this
[57:57] I know I'm preaching to the choir
[57:58] tonight but just bear with me it's
[58:00] Wednesday night I know I'll I'll try not
[58:02] to keep us long but here we have a
[58:05] promise in this book
[58:07] and if we can establish the word of God
[58:10] to be the absolute there's coming a time
[58:12] where this Elijah is going to come
[58:15] there's going to be a prophet named
[58:18] Elijah with an Elijah anointing that
[58:20] comes before the great and Dreadful day
[58:22] of the Lord
[58:23] and it's interesting because we know
[58:25] that we've seen many false prophets go
[58:28] out that's the word of God and even this
[58:31] one Tony Palmer he said I come to you in
[58:35] the spirit of Elijah
[58:38] I don't know if everyone has seen that
[58:39] video before
[58:41] but if you look at that video If You
[58:43] typed in Tony Palmer
[58:45] um
[58:46] Church in the U.S I can't remember what
[58:48] it's called exactly I can actually find
[58:50] it and send it out on the WhatsApp if
[58:51] you're interested send me a text if you
[58:54] are well what he says is he comes in the
[58:56] spirit of reconciliation in the
[58:59] anointing of Elijah
[59:02] and so if we are wondering where we are
[59:05] today brothers and sisters they have no
[59:07] idea though most of the world has no
[59:09] idea that Elijah's already come
[59:13] right and here we have this guy saying
[59:15] this and now everyone's going whoo ah
[59:18] wow really and really what he was saying
[59:21] to the people The ecumenical council in
[59:24] the United States this is modern history
[59:27] he was saying that the petition the the
[59:29] protest is over Luther's protest is over
[59:32] and if anybody has any questions about
[59:34] it the Catholic church has assigned
[59:37] documents saying that the protest is
[59:40] over
[59:41] and he said so now what are you
[59:44] protesting
[59:46] this was to The ecumenical leaders in
[59:48] the United States of America in in
[59:50] modern history like 10 years ago maybe
[59:53] 15 years ago he was telling him this
[59:57] false prophet
[59:59] I don't know I I think it's amazing when
[1:00:02] we can look at this because we look at
[1:00:03] it and understand where we stand we
[1:00:05] understand exactly the anointings of
[1:00:07] Elijah but just for the sake of
[1:00:09] discussion tonight I wanted to point out
[1:00:11] verse 5 Malachi 4 behold I will send you
[1:00:14] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:00:16] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:00:17] if we just stopped there we would be
[1:00:19] able to say for sure there is a promise
[1:00:22] in the Bible that there's coming a time
[1:00:23] where that Elijah will come now we have
[1:00:26] to look at the Elijah's that come in the
[1:00:28] world or the eliases that come in the
[1:00:30] world what do they do what is their
[1:00:32] Hallmark what are they talking about are
[1:00:34] they pointing to the word of God the
[1:00:37] truth for the hour or are they pointing
[1:00:39] to a group or a movement or or a
[1:00:42] denomination
[1:00:44] and you know many people would say the
[1:00:46] Catholic Church oh the Catholic Church
[1:00:48] isn't good I remember growing up in the
[1:00:50] Pentecostal Realms and they said the
[1:00:51] Catholic church is the devil
[1:00:54] but they would also say the Baptists
[1:00:55] have got it wrong and and the
[1:00:57] Presbyterians have got it wrong and were
[1:00:58] the only ones that have it right how can
[1:01:01] that be
[1:01:02] isn't it wonderful to think that the
[1:01:03] Elijah that we know that we have heard
[1:01:06] that we have been given ears to hear for
[1:01:08] our day he said you know what's God
[1:01:10] going to judge the World by he's going
[1:01:12] to judge it by his word
[1:01:15] he's not going to judge it by a a an
[1:01:17] ecumenical movement he's not going to
[1:01:19] judge it by a theological school by the
[1:01:22] teaching by the degree that we get from
[1:01:24] there he's not going to judge it by a
[1:01:26] denomination
[1:01:27] he's going to judge it by his word
[1:01:31] that's why it's so important for us to
[1:01:33] eat the book
[1:01:34] get every word in in you
[1:01:37] just get it down make sure you get it in
[1:01:39] you you know turn with me quickly while
[1:01:41] we still have a few minutes over to
[1:01:42] Matthew chapter 11.
[1:01:47] talking about Elijah
[1:01:56] this was something I guess for me that
[1:01:59] was one of the greatest
[1:02:02] divinely inspired Revelations for me
[1:02:05] personally
[1:02:07] pertaining to the message of the hour
[1:02:09] and it gave me the ability to say wait a
[1:02:12] second I need to see what this book has
[1:02:15] to say what what really is inside this
[1:02:18] book
[1:02:19] when I heard this because I had heard
[1:02:21] Malachi 4 5
[1:02:23] um many times but I just couldn't
[1:02:25] connect the dots I know that you know so
[1:02:29] here we go in in Matthew chapter 11.
[1:02:31] let's just jump down to verse 12.
[1:02:40] Matthew chapter 11 verse 12. and from
[1:02:43] the days of John the Baptist until now
[1:02:45] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:02:47] and the violent take it by force
[1:02:51] for all the prophets and the law
[1:02:53] prophesied unto John
[1:02:56] this is Jesus speaking here and if ye
[1:02:59] will receive it
[1:03:01] this is Elias
[1:03:04] which was for to come
[1:03:07] and here we have Jesus saying to the
[1:03:10] people
[1:03:10] saying to the disciples saying to
[1:03:12] everyone that's listening to him he that
[1:03:14] hath ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:03:17] let them hear what
[1:03:19] I would say this let them hear what the
[1:03:21] spirit saith unto the church
[1:03:24] because we know that's the exact same
[1:03:26] verbiage that we find over in the Book
[1:03:28] of Revelations
[1:03:30] isn't it interesting to see that it's
[1:03:33] not a different word it's the same word
[1:03:36] and and here we have Jesus saying it in
[1:03:39] the flesh when he's alive on Earth with
[1:03:41] his feet on the ground but John sees him
[1:03:45] as the son of man
[1:03:47] standing in the midst of the
[1:03:49] candlesticks with the white hair and the
[1:03:50] eyes of fire and the feet of brass he
[1:03:53] sees him in his divine nature but here
[1:03:56] we have Jesus saying if ye will receive
[1:03:58] it this is Elias which was to come all
[1:04:01] the prophets and the law prophesied
[1:04:03] until John
[1:04:05] turn over to Matthew chapter 17.
[1:04:09] Jesus was preaching to them he was
[1:04:11] trying to eliminate this he was trying
[1:04:13] to shine it on them but we know that
[1:04:15] they were documenting it for a purpose
[1:04:17] they were sharing it for the future
[1:04:20] Generations
[1:04:22] but there is also a thing for them to to
[1:04:24] be able to understand we know they had
[1:04:26] Revelation in their days we've already
[1:04:28] gone over that tonight
[1:04:30] but in Matthew chapter 17 verse 9 this
[1:04:33] is the story of of Mount Transfiguration
[1:04:35] by the way they just went up and and and
[1:04:38] they they they had the tremendous
[1:04:40] experience Jesus hand-picked the
[1:04:42] brothers that he wanted to go with them
[1:04:43] up to the top of the mountain it was
[1:04:46] where Jesus was transfigured before
[1:04:48] their eyes we've talked about this
[1:04:49] scripture quite a bit in the past but we
[1:04:52] know that even in the midst of it there
[1:04:55] was a human nature that got in the way
[1:04:57] Peter didn't know what to do he he was
[1:04:59] awkward and uneasy and brother Brad I
[1:05:01] mean we brought that quote a while ago
[1:05:03] he didn't know what to say and he always
[1:05:04] had to say something and so he said well
[1:05:06] well why don't we just build an altar
[1:05:09] what one for thee and one for Moses and
[1:05:11] one for Elias and and and it'll be good
[1:05:14] and what happened was a bright Cloud
[1:05:16] overshadowed them and they heard one
[1:05:18] voice speaking out of that bright Cloud
[1:05:19] didn't they this is my beloved Son hear
[1:05:22] ye him and we know that voice was must
[1:05:25] have been like thunder because they all
[1:05:26] fell on their face as dead they all
[1:05:28] became very very afraid in that that
[1:05:30] moment but then when they opened their
[1:05:32] eyes when that voice stopped and they
[1:05:34] looked to see if they were still alive
[1:05:36] they saw Jesus only that's what the
[1:05:39] scripture says
[1:05:40] and we just carry on now after all of
[1:05:43] that verse 9 and as they came down from
[1:05:46] the mountain this is Matthew 17 verse 9
[1:05:48] and as they came down from the mountain
[1:05:50] Jesus charged them saying television to
[1:05:52] no man until the son of man be risen
[1:05:54] again from the dead
[1:05:56] and his disciples asked him saying why
[1:05:59] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:06:03] first come
[1:06:04] he had already preached to them that
[1:06:07] Elias was coming
[1:06:10] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:06:12] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:06:15] all things according to Malachi he knew
[1:06:18] that they were all talking about this
[1:06:20] but Jesus and Jesus answered and said
[1:06:23] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[1:06:25] and restore all things but I say unto
[1:06:28] you that Elias has come already and they
[1:06:31] knew him not but have done unto him
[1:06:33] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[1:06:36] they also the son of man suffer of them
[1:06:41] verse 13 is what I wanted to get to
[1:06:43] tonight
[1:06:44] then the disciples understood that he
[1:06:47] spake unto them of who
[1:06:49] of John the Baptist
[1:06:52] so I thought he was talking about Elias
[1:06:55] wasn't he talking about Elijah
[1:06:58] he was referring to Elijah Elias
[1:07:01] in those scriptures
[1:07:02] but now he's saying John the Baptist
[1:07:05] so this is where it became crystal clear
[1:07:07] for me this is where it became that
[1:07:09] elimination of the of the Roman Candle
[1:07:11] where it started to really make sense to
[1:07:13] me and shine a light all around and
[1:07:16] that's when I started to realize there's
[1:07:17] way more to this book than what I
[1:07:19] thought from the beginning and and what
[1:07:21] it is is that there is five comings of
[1:07:25] the spirit of Elijah and and we can get
[1:07:28] into this we don't have time to tonight
[1:07:29] maybe we will just a little bit we'll
[1:07:31] touch on it there's five comings
[1:07:33] documented in the Bible of the spirit of
[1:07:36] Elijah and four have already happened
[1:07:39] and we know that we know that there was
[1:07:42] Elijah there was Elisha and and those
[1:07:45] stories are just fantastic I just want
[1:07:47] to preach on those now that we're
[1:07:49] talking about it there was Elijah there
[1:07:51] was Elisha there was John the Baptist
[1:07:53] there was William Branham
[1:07:56] and there's one more coming
[1:07:58] and that one more that's coming I wonder
[1:08:00] was that the one that was standing there
[1:08:01] with Jesus just to throw it in there
[1:08:03] just as a thought which one was it that
[1:08:05] was there with Jesus and and Moses it's
[1:08:08] an interesting thing but there's another
[1:08:10] one coming and we know that that's one
[1:08:12] of the two witnesses the prophet in our
[1:08:14] day William Bradham he said it that
[1:08:16] Moses and Elijah will actually be the
[1:08:18] two witnesses that are mentioned in the
[1:08:21] Book of Revelations over in Israel and
[1:08:24] you know I I think it's interesting
[1:08:25] topic too because some people say that
[1:08:28] those witnesses will be here when the
[1:08:30] bride is still here just before the
[1:08:31] Rapture goes and some say brother
[1:08:34] Bradham says it he says it that way and
[1:08:36] he also says that the bride will be gone
[1:08:38] when they're there so what will it be
[1:08:40] who knows whether we're here or whether
[1:08:42] we're not I I think it's interesting
[1:08:44] because there will be two witnesses in
[1:08:46] the land of Israel and one of them will
[1:08:48] have the anointing of Elijah
[1:08:53] it might not be Elijah himself in the
[1:08:55] flesh
[1:08:56] one of them will have the anointing of
[1:08:59] Elijah
[1:09:00] so tonight brothers and sisters I just
[1:09:03] wanted to set the initial background for
[1:09:06] this for the the
[1:09:09] the church age book
[1:09:12] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:09:15] and uh I'm actually going to call the
[1:09:17] musicians
[1:09:18] I don't want to keep us long tonight
[1:09:20] we're going to have two services on the
[1:09:22] weekend and we went a little bit over
[1:09:23] last week so I'll try and balance it out
[1:09:25] a little bit for us so we can maybe go
[1:09:27] home a little bit early tonight but I
[1:09:29] just want to encourage us to pray about
[1:09:31] this pray about the leadership of the
[1:09:34] Lord in in studying this book there's so
[1:09:37] much in here that we're going to get
[1:09:38] into and I purposely didn't get into it
[1:09:42] very far tonight because there's so much
[1:09:44] to get into when we get into the
[1:09:47] revelation of Jesus Christ chapter one
[1:09:49] there's so much in there I I'm going to
[1:09:52] find it difficult to stop but I just
[1:09:55] want to make sure that we take our time
[1:09:56] we don't rush through this there's so
[1:09:58] very much in here and just like brother
[1:10:01] Branham said he prays the blessing of
[1:10:03] God upon each reader I think that we
[1:10:06] have the ability as Sons and Daughters
[1:10:07] of God as Believers of this message of
[1:10:09] the hour to say hey I want that blessing
[1:10:12] I want that kind of blessing he's
[1:10:15] actually prayed the prophet of God
[1:10:17] prayed for so many people to be healed
[1:10:19] for so many good things to happen to
[1:10:21] people in their lives
[1:10:23] what about saying Hey I want that
[1:10:25] blessing I want that that special
[1:10:27] blessing that he said I pray the
[1:10:29] blessing of God upon each reader and may
[1:10:32] illumination by the spirit of God be
[1:10:34] each one special portion I just think
[1:10:36] Lord let that be me let that Spirit uh
[1:10:40] elimination by the spirit just be my
[1:10:43] special portion
[1:10:45] and I think that he'll Grant it to us I
[1:10:47] really believe that maybe stand with me
[1:10:49] tonight as we close
[1:10:54] let's just bow in prayer
[1:10:57] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:10:59] your goodness to each and every one of
[1:11:01] us
[1:11:02] thank you Father for the desire of your
[1:11:05] children to
[1:11:07] bring of their licks of Fire Lord to
[1:11:09] bring of their portion of your spirit to
[1:11:12] gather together in your name
[1:11:15] father we thank you for this body of
[1:11:17] Believers here in Calgary thank you for
[1:11:19] your goodness to each and every one of
[1:11:21] us Lord father we thank you that you've
[1:11:23] given us ears to hear what the spirit
[1:11:25] saith unto the church and we know that
[1:11:28] you have called out out of the called
[1:11:30] out and you're still calling father and
[1:11:33] Lord I pray that father we could have
[1:11:35] this blessing that your Prophet asked
[1:11:38] for that your Prophet wrote he he put it
[1:11:41] in writing and Lord I know I I I say
[1:11:45] your Prophet but I believe
[1:11:47] the words that your Prophet spoke Lord
[1:11:49] were your words
[1:11:53] we know that he was a man of like
[1:11:54] passion
[1:11:56] we know that he went through many ups
[1:11:58] and downs just like we do and that's the
[1:12:01] reason why you chose him because you
[1:12:05] work through man you speak through man
[1:12:06] you act through man
[1:12:09] and father I pray that tonight we could
[1:12:11] just Lord have your spirit with us that
[1:12:14] we would think about the lives that we
[1:12:17] live in and and what we do and that Lord
[1:12:19] we would have the desire to see you live
[1:12:23] out through US father
[1:12:26] not a man's thoughts not a man's ideas
[1:12:29] not a a
[1:12:31] churchianity but Lord Jesus the literal
[1:12:34] life
[1:12:35] your life living out through US father I
[1:12:38] pray that you would just go with us as
[1:12:39] we go our separate ways that we would
[1:12:41] Lord think about these words that we
[1:12:43] heard tonight father that we would
[1:12:45] desire to read this book and father
[1:12:48] understand that it's inspired by Your
[1:12:51] Word
[1:12:53] we love you father we thank you we just
[1:12:55] want to commit each one into your hands
[1:12:56] as we go our separate ways tonight
