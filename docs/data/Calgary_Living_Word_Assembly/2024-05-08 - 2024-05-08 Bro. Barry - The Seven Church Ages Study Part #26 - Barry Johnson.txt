to Revelations chapter 2 just to walk into the room full of people Desiring to give their gift back to the body back to the Lord Jesus Christ certainly humbling thank you each one Revelations chap 2:8 talking about the saman church age Revelations chapter 2:8 says and the unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things sayth the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for the ear to hear Lord Jesus and we know father that it's not plural ears to hear it's singular father and Lord Jesus tonight I pray that our hearts would be singular towards you father that we would just desire to feed on the unfailing body word of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight we pray that you would break this Bread open to us fresh once again Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly have been enjoying this study the exposition of the seven Church ages saman Church age has been a good study a real good study I don't want to go too far backwards tonight because I really want to press forward and uh Lord willing we will where we left off last week was sort of what brother Bram talks about quite extensively in the message the token about how there was a blood that was shed at Calvary the blood test shows whether you belong to God or not and he Likens it to running cattle out on a range where they had to actually check the cattle before they could turn them loose to make sure that they were purebred cattle and the inspector letting the cattle through wasn't interested in the type of cattle he wasn't interested in the type of Brands he wasn't interested in how big they were how small they were only thing he was interested in is that they had that blood tag that they showed they were the pure blood and it's not the chemical of the blood in terms of Jesus Christ it's actually the life of the blood many people claim the chemical part of the blood but not many people can actually say be thou Lord over my life and let the life of that blood reign supreme in my life life and that is the critical factor it's not the chemical portion we'll just pick up from paragraph 111 where we left off last week brother bradam says you know God looked down and declared the soul that sinth it shall die it is separated from me it can't approach unto me we know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God Amen that meant that all died and were separated and one day a time would come when even that bit of life would be snuffed out and it would all be all over but God In Love took an animal and took its life in place of the sinner's life and I think we talked about how Adam and Eve after they sinned they got to walk out of the Garden of Eden they were escorted out they were no longer allowed access to the Tree of Life we know there was two trees in the garden one was the Tree of Life Jesus Christ God himself the other one was Satan and they were told not to pick of the fruit not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Satan but Eve was deceived she decided to listen to the word of Satan instead of taking the word of God and that is where Adam said I can't lose that part of me she was a part of him God took her from his side the very first operation that ever happened and he willingly stepped out from eternity to save that part of him Amen in the Old Testament brother bradam says The Sinner brought a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the Lamb's throat he felt the bleeding and heard the bleeting he felt the body stiffen in death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood Ascend to God he knew that the lamb had taken his place he knew the Lamb's life had been forfeited for his but the life of that lamb was animal life and it could not come back upon the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin he would go out with sin in his mind and come back and offer a sacrifice for the same thing a year later but in the New Testament it is not so our dying lamb is the Son of God who gave his blood a ransom for many amen I love how brother brandham talks about this as we go further he does it he weaves it in and out through the book here but he makes it very clear that this dying lamb was not a second or a third person this was God by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that lamb and you know that's the hardest thing for a Believer isn't it to be able to walk up and place our hands upon that lamb and say that our sin is dealt with one time once and for all our sin is over it's almost impossible for us to do that and maybe we would say well how come do we have to repent and and die to ourselves daily because the old man wants to live but the sin bill has been completely settled and paid for but Satan wants to make us feel like no no no it isn't you've got something that you need to do and the only thing that we need to do is accept that he did it not try and do something on our own and the more we do that the more humbling it becomes because we recognize there's nothing that we did to deserve this that's why it's so interesting the more revelated people get the more humble truly humble they become because they can see it clearer and clearer there's nothing they've done there's nothing they could ever do there's nothing that anybody could ever do it's all God it's all Grace he says we see him with the bloody wounds the lacerated back the cruel Thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and what happened the life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repentant one but first that life went and destroyed the veil separating man and God went right to the temple and said your form of worship is over the life that was in him came back Upon Us amen we go back with no more desire to sin and we now possess a hatred for the works and lusts of the Flesh and that's what causes us to repent because we hate this flesh this flesh wants to sin this hybrid nature wants to sin yes and oh the devil makes it seem so fun so smooth right so enticing but this flesh isn't what rules because if we walk after the flesh we die right they that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit paragraph 111 look at us what is our life just one little cell that came from our father the female does not have the hemoglobin she produces the egg she's the incubator but the blood comes from the male that is why the woman takes the man's name the children take his name the mother is the incubator for the children she Bears him the that is what happened for our Redemption the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary and she bore a son and called him Jesus the great Creator came down and became a sacrifice for our sin his blood was the blood of God I don't know how you can dispute that just tear that page out I guess just say it doesn't apply or whatever that is exactly what it was it had to be that blood of God was shed dead and the spirit left him as he died in agony then the same life Spirit came back to indwell the repentant Sinner and set him free that sinner did not come back year after year sacrifice after sacrifice for there was no need by one sacrifice once and for all he has been set free from the Dominion of sin and has received the Life of Christ where by He reigns in victory over sin Over The World the Flesh and the devil I think it's so beautiful I just was in uh in a study last night and we're studying the seven the exposition of the seven Church ages but uh you know brother bradam he says that in another place in in this uh in this book and it's just it's just amazing out of the uh revelation of Jesus Christ right at the very beginning he says it in paragraph 123 of this book you don't have to go there right now I'm just going to say it just because it was it's interesting I was just studying it last night but it's the exact same thing he says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil I remember brother Ken preaching that so clearly we have that right now brothers and sisters we're not going going to attain to it someday we've got that right now through the blood of Jesus Christ which was God's own blood if it wasn't God's own blood then we're done for we might as well pack up and go home but it was God's blood amen such a beautiful thing I I just think it's wonderful to think that we have dominion over that we don't have to worry about Satan coming around and trying to make us think that we're we're we're not actually able to overcome this it was God that did it and he did it so that we could overcome all of those things amen now I went and lost my place I do apologize bear with me for a second there we go paragraph 116 God did it I'll just go back and read the last sentence it's so good he reigns in victory over sin over the world over the Flesh and the devil God did it he did it all he cried out to the world the world cursed in sin I will give you a sign a virgin shall be with child a virgin shall conceive and bear a son that will be your sign it will be an everlasting sign what she brings forth will be Emmanuel God With Us God came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the Holy Ghost and in excuse me that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seat of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our Salvation when the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary he created within her womb that cell that would multiply and become the body of Our Lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of God that is who Jesus is and that Holy One was filled with Holy Blood even the blood of God that Tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went to Jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of John in the river called Jordan when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water God came and indwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure I just thought it was so interesting I just have to throw this in there isn't it isn't it interesting to think about that life that was in that blood that was in Mary that life was so powerful in that blood that was in Mary even with just a few little cells there that at the name of Jesus in the ears of her cousin she actually got baptized with the Holy Ghost right there John was filled with B with the Holy Ghost right there baptized with the Holy Ghost right there Just Amazing Just those little cells that blood that life in the blood and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the Christ as his savior just have to accept it oh how striking it is now I love this part he gets in to to say in some stuff here how striking it is Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your Everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo intellectuals that have evolved their own Theology and denied the truth of god Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking Barn not another person then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticizing and acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen I will give you a sign said God not the sign of a white-collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you will want or think suitable nothing but it's an everlasting sign it's the greatest sign of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the Hypocrites Jered and dared him to come down off the cross sometimes you just hear it you read it you just can't even really exactly there's going to be some conversation one day about that very thing Jehovah dying Jehovah praying and nothing happening can you imagine then Jehovah died that is the sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one I think that's important for us to just dwell on we need to maybe think about this this just really struck me while I was studying it and I thought you know maybe sometimes we just need to remember this even Jehovah prayed and nothing happened our prayers don't get answered like that it's not instant gratification brothers and sisters we can't just have fast prayers fast food prayer it doesn't work that way sometimes he doesn't answer for our benefit amen then Darkness Came Upon the Earth they put him in a tomb there he lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to indwell his church it's not second third anyone Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people amen don't put it off on the prophet yes sir don't put it off on some future day don't look back he did all that so that you could have the power tonight once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again Jehovah heals the sick raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation amen I love this Jehovah came down and he raised Ed The Prostitute to sin no more sir he came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter now brothers and sisters one day I'll give you my testimony that's me that's me I know what that's like he came down to my gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory I just can't help but think brothers and sisters he has come down so that he can manifest through our flesh so that we can find those last predestinated seeds so that we can go and witness and encourage those people who maybe are a little bit Wayward they're a little bit way late far be it from us as the truly revelated mature believer Bel to be scorning at people for not coming to church our job is to encourage them not discourage them and shame on us if we ever encouraged or discouraged anyone to not come to church because they haven't been coming to church we should only be encouraging for people that have been discouraged what's the best way to uh get rid of discouragement encouragement just simply encourage people you get more bees with honey to go and shame somebody because they haven't come to church what does that do it Puffs us up because we feel like well we've come to church and I've been there every service and I ain't seen you why haven't you been there what does that do to them it makes them feel low makes them feel bad we're here so that he can manifest through us so that we can encourage others to come and experience to taste of the fruit of the land the pomegranate and the figs the honey and the milk if we're over in that promised land that is paragraph 122 he says yes Jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raise them up at the last day Hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them for they are the Lambs and they will follow him wherever he goes now remember he's talking to every single Church age here he's not just talking about that age the samian church age we can put it off by a statement like that and say well he's just talking about them no he's not he says it on every single Church age this is applicable in every single age the holy spirit in every age what a coincidence Revelations 2:11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church churches there is not one Church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith but it's absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages so isn't it wonderful to think brothers and sisters tonight I was just having a little Jubilee thinking reading this we have the ability to hear this we've got every single reason to jump and Shout to beat the tambourine up and down the bank of the river knowing that the horse and Riders drown in the sea our enemy is gone he has saved us he's redeemed Us by his own blood we've got every reason to sing and shout to Rejoice to know what he's done for us because we have the ear to hear it it doesn't do anything for us to say that we've got the ear and and we don't give praise for it but just to recognize it it just is so amazing 1 Corinthians 2: 6-16 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery amen my many people love mysteries even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written eye hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God and I just thought you know real soon I couldn't do it this afternoon when I was thinking about this but uh real soon I just want to sit down and watch the Deep calleth to the Deep we we mustn't take that for granted that's one of the videos that we could actually see where we have the Vindicated Prophet the mouthpiece of God to this age the culmination of all the ages if there's a deep calling brothers and sisters there is a deep to respond and you know what we have the things of God revealed unto us by his spirit amen and how do we get his Spirit how do we truly get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit by following the word by getting back in line exactly the way this Vindicated Prophet said just get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins according to the word of God and you'll receive theol Holy Ghost the spirit and that spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even to the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God oh my which things also we speak not in words Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him oh my but we have the mind of Christ we followed the word the word that said let this mind be in you that mind that was in Christ Jesus and who is Christ Jesus we just heard brother bradam explain it from the blood cell from the word to the to the to the Virgin to the blood cell Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah it's not another spirit it's not another person it's not nothing else it's Jehovah therefore speak I to them in Parables because this is Matthew 1313 to6 therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias which saith by hearing you shall hear and not understand and seeing you shall see and not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear mine John 84244 Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me can you imagine that those people disputing with him if God were your father you would love me because I am God Jesus said unto them if God were your father ye would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me amen why do ye not understand my speech even because you cannot bear my word year of your father the devil can't even imagine that and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a li and the father of it it's most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear God that ability has to be given him of God Matthew 16:17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven putting these verses together we see that there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age it's one special group that receives the Revelation for each age and that group is the elect now brothers and sisters it's one thing to say that I have an ear to hear I can hear what the spirit says I can hear that God sent a prophet I can hear the message of the hour I can hear the seals I can hear all the Mysteries I've heard it my whole life I was raised in it I know it amen but can you live it because that's the evidence amen the evidence is being able to walk the walk not just talk the talk amen it's pretty easy to talk but we've got to be able to walk the walk that one special group out of every single age is the elect and unfortunately many of the ages they had to walk themselves to their death to prove who they were we we have to actually walk away from ourselves we have to divorce our old nature we've got to be willing to sacrifice everything inside this old man and let every single Speck of him die so that he could live Hallelujah the interesting thing is with every single age there's always a death a sacrificial death now we don't lay down our lives and die to actually create a sacrifice that would be acceptable unto God although we do sacrifice our nature our spirit has got to die every single Speck of the old man's got to go that group is of God because the group that cannot hear is not of God John 842 to 44 we just read the scripture the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the Revelation thereof is that group described in 1 Corinthians 2:6 to6 16 they are the ones who have the spirit of God they are the ones that are born of God they are baptized into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they are baptized with the Holy Ghost to further bring out what we have just said and to also use a scripture that should be borne in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost see what Jesus said in John 6 and Isaiah 5413 whence this is taken John 6:45 it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God Isaiah 54:13 and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord the all of God are the children of God Amen thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of God he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't say in any age that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying saying that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophesying Etc aside as an Evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that is exactly what Jesus said he would do when he came John 1426 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance amen what whatsoever I have said unto you not another word the only thing he did when he came that that teacher the comforter that instructor as he just pointed back to what Jesus said Jehovah said through Jesus Jehovah in flesh he just pointed back to the word and that's all that this Prophet for our day did and that's all that we want to do is just point back to the word amen to the word to the word it's got to be the word amen and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written these men had recalled to their minds by the Holy Ghost the very words that Jesus spake that is why the gospels are accurate they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring did not only bring all things to their minds but he taught them further on the truth they already had and you know brothers and sisters he still teaching us further about the truth we already have and the only thing that's happening is we're just saying Amen to the word we're saying Amen to the message every time we listen to a message we hear something new in the same message we've already heard 100,000 times over but we just say Amen there's something else there that's the spirit speaking to us amen it's the internal teacher he's the one teaching us that is how Paul received his Revelations he was was taught by the Holy Ghost he said concerning it in Galatians 1:11-12 but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it of man but by the revelation of Jesus Christ and I just I love that I love hearing that I love knowing that we just simply preach what Paul preached that's it we're not trying to put a new spin on it man we're just going back to what the word said to what Paul preached and he just said it I wasn't taught this no man taught me Gia never taught me this I never learned it in the synagogue God taught me this Jehovah God spoke to me when I was on my road to go and slay his Saints he stopped me in my tracks by the pillar of fire and he said you know what Paul Saul it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks you need to just follow the instruction that I give you and we know that's what he did that's the one we follow amen paragraph 131 one day when Jesus was upon Earth a certain important man came to visit him this man said Rabbi we know you are a teacher sent from God but you will notice that Jesus cut him short he turned to Nicodemus and the words he spoke May well be paraphrased thusly I am not a teacher I am the sacrificial lamb for sin I am making possible the new Birth by my spirit but there is one coming who is the teacher he is the holy spirit amen when Jesus was upon the Earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet amen but when he came back upon the church by his Spirit he became the teacher and to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches but only a Spirit-filled man can hear the Revelation for that age amen that's pretty cutting because what comes first the believer or the spirit goes on to say none other can no sir they cannot because that is exactly what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2 verse 6-16 paragraph 133 now this ought to make you rejoice there is a most peculiar Doctrine in the air that is causing much misunder understanding and hard feelings for when the Pentecostals say You must speak in tongues or you haven't been baptized with the Holy Ghost they are either denying that great men like Knox Moody Taylor go forth and others did not receive the holy ghost or saying that they all secretly spoke in tongues and were not aware of what was going on now that's not true no sir that's gross error tongues are not the evidence of being Spirit-filled you know I I was raised with that ideology that tongues are the initial evidence that that was it it was in my fiber you know how brother bradam said it you give give the Catholic Church said give us a child to age what five and we'll have him for life I was in the church the Pentecostal Church church till age probably 10 12 somewhere in there this was something that I had to overcome I had to get the Revelation from God to understand that the word of God says that there's other spiritual gifts it's not just one and in fact when you hear the prophet talk about it and then you read it in the Bible you have to say wow the tongues is actually the least of the gifts but you'd base an entire salvation on the fact that you actually are able to speak in tongues oh my it's not even in the word I love the way he just brings it out here tongues is not the evidence of being Spirit-filled it's simply one of the nine manifestations mentioned in First Corinthians 12 I just wanted to pause there just for a few minutes tonight I hope it's okay let's just turn over there just just to shine a flashlight on this amen because brother random he doesn't talk about them all here but I just think it's important sometimes just to point to the word just point to the word so what he's referencing here is 1 Corinthians 12 there's no scripture that says you receive the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking in tongues 1 Corinthians chapter 12 this is Paul speaking to the Corinthian Church now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant and we know that Paul was not the author of this Paul was the Scribe it was the Holy Spirit Penning these words amen so when you hear I this is god Jehovah that one we've been talking about all night now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were LED wherefore I gave you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost amen now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of Administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom so I just reading this I would think automatically the word of wisdom being the first one that's mentioned is actually the most important wouldn't not be the most important to think having a little bit of wisdom spiritually speaking that would go a long ways wouldn't it for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpret ration of tongues so the speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues are like that in the church but all these worketh that one and the self Same Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will amen for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free or have been all made and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen so talking about tongues are not the evidence of being Spirit-filled it is simply one of the nine manifestations we just read nine manifestations mentioned in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 there is no scripture that says you receive the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the Holy Spirit by speaking in tongues but it does say that after they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they spake in tongues and later on it says that they prophesied today many folks today amongst many folks sorry it is taken for granted that all all who claim to receive the Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues speak in a genuine spiritual tongue but this is not so for many PE many people speak in a known tongue but under the influence of a wrong spirit I heard a story once when I was growing up in the Pentecostal ranks it just made me laugh when I heard it as uh believer today but uh when I think about it anyways they had an altar call and there was a young man that wanted to get the Holy Ghost but didn't really feel led to come up and they had an evangelist and he was a fire and brimstone preacher and this is many years ago the fire and brimstone preacher called him out called him up and said you want to receive the Holy Ghost and he didn't say it quiet like that and he got him up there and he put his hand on him and started jumping and shaking and fitting and said the guy actually started to speak in German he had a second tongue he started to speak in German just so the guy would leave him alone and he did he was like wow you got it you got it praise the Lord and he was like yeah see you later but just because you have a different tongue it doesn't mean that you're actually speaking by the spirit brother Bram says for many people speak in a known tongue but under the influence of a wrong Spirit now let's say we are in a meeting and people are all speaking in tongues how can you tell which tongue is from the spirit and which is from the devil have you have you spoken to people that speak in tongues I think we talked about this last time or one of these times they'll just be talking to you and then they'll start to testify and then they'll start to go off in an unknown language and then they'll face back in and be speaking English again and there's no interpretation of it but you got to wonder what they just say brother bradam says I have been almost the Heathen I have been amongst sorry not almost forgive me I have been amongst the Heathen where the Wizards drank blood out of a human skull so I'm just going to go back I jumped ahead brother Ram says now let's say we are at a meeting and people are all speaking in tongues how do you know which tongue is from the spirit and which is from the devil it's amazing because he's saying there's two types of tongues I have been amongst the Heathen where the Wizards drank blood out of a skull spoken tongues and interpreted and prophesied they can even write in tongues now if tongues is the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost then every tongue would have to be of God right it's just so plain but it has been admitted by tongues evidence people that there are false and true tongues for God has the genuine and Satan has the false so my question is who knows what's real who understood the language to know what was spoken who has the gift of discernment to know but when we get those answers we will have something to go on but until then we have to wonder about the source of the tongues you can see right now that if you back up a tongue's evidence and don't know what is being said you have to finally come to the place where all tongues have to be of God that would lead us to then to believe that the devil cannot speak in tongues that is not so no not for a minute any true missionary on a foreign field knows only too well that Devils speak in other tongues the same as I know it by experience the Pentecostal theologians admit that they have no scripture setting forth that people speak with tongues when baptized by the Holy Ghost they admit that they infer it from the experiences set forth in the book of Acts wherein three out of five times the people spoke with tongues and the they also say without any Scripture that there are two kinds of tongues one is the tongue you speak in while receiving the Holy Ghost and it is the evidence while later on if you believe you can receive the gift of tongues whereby you may speak often however they say once having spoken in tongues as the evidence of receiving you may never speak again it's just too confusing isn't it I I don't think that God wants his gospel his manifestation of gifts to be confusing in fact he said through Paul didn't he just say that I Brethren I would not have you ignorant concerning this but this is complicated man paragraph 139 once more we are anxious to know where this is found in the word if isn't there then God hath not spoken it and woe unto him who would add to that word how many can say Amen to that tonight amen but there is something in the word about this very subject that they ignore completely First Corinthians 13 it mentions tongues of men and angels these would be known and unknown tongues known and unknown tongues modern Pentecostal say they can receive the Holy Ghost speaking in unknown or Angelic tongues they have the cart before the horse for in Acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard and understood it's just so clear when you do it this way isn't it now when God is silent we had better be silent I've got that highlighted here but where he has spoken we had better speak to and say what he has already said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach us all truth and that's what brother bradam can say the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to be able to say Amen to the word where it corrects me in culture where it corrects me in gender where it takes a hide off of my desires I don't like the the word of God the way it makes this flesh feel but it's not about this flesh it's about his spirit in this flesh his spirit in that soul that place that he created and and the true evidence is to be able to say Amen to the word and then subject this life to that Amen to the word just gets me excited he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the inside teacher come and teach us all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher not someone just teaching you to get on your knees and pray and just pray and just pray and eventually something will start to come up and you'll start to speak in an unknown tongue and then you'll have the Holy Ghost if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day and there's many people brothers and sisters that don't have an ear to hear what the spirit says but they sure like the anointing in the message churches we just read it there that was a sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it amen they didn't just hear it they weren't just hearers they were doers though those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went on to sin and I want to say this the carnal men that hear the word they usually have a lot of conflict there's a lot of problems and issues and we've got situations that we just need to try and sort out and there's always something isn't there that's carnal man but when the spirit comes on the scene it changes that man amen from the inside out amen the problems that used to be problems they really don't matter anymore cuz the only thing that matters is Christ in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and what and lived it many people have taken this message and tried to live it and and try to live it and try to live it and try to live it and what happens when they're trying to live it is they typically become legalists and they point at everyone else and say you know what I never saw you in service last week you know what your hair is a little bit too long you know what you've got a beard you know what those rims on your car you know what your job you know what your location you know what you know what you know what get saved get out of that that that man-made light get out of the man-made conditions and get behind that inner Veil get Christ in your life and you won't be looking at all of the carnality we'll be looking at our brothers and we'll be saying that's Jesus Christ there's a seat of God in there we'll be looking at our sisters and we'll be saying praise the Lord that's Jesus Christ manifest in flesh right there am and you know what even if we bitterly disagree we'll still say amen God richly bless you we won't have to run away to different sides of the world there ain't going to be different zones in heaven it's not going to be different countries in heaven we're going to be all one body paragraph 142 I know it is a great temptation to refer back to the day of Pentecost and also to the day when the Holy Ghost fell in the house of Cornelius and then set those two identical experiences as the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but on each occasion the tongues were understood by the listeners that's right I just love this it just makes it so clear when you have someone just speaking to you and then they go off there's no interpretation you got to scratch your head and you want to say Lord help them give me a word fitly spoken that could actually maybe encourage them to your word to your spirit because you know you can see what's going on it doesn't give us occasion to actually throw off on people we have compassion for them this is a far cry from the modern Babble Of Confusion of Pentecostal meetings boy I feel like we could just keep going with this here my my my paragraph 143 and if this were not enough to persuade us to leave off such reasoning what will we do when we are confronted with the fact that people who have never spoken in tongues have some of the other eight manifestations in their lives such as the word of wisdom the Discerning of spirits the word of knowledge Faith healing and even Miracles and this observation is even more interesting in the light that tongues is the least of the nine gifts so when we see people who do not nor ever have spoken in tongues use greater gifts than those who do speak in tongues we must discount such a Doctrine even more completely than before so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the Bible has not said we can't afford to do that when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring for to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything they surely bring and bear out this truth I think that's just amazing I'm just going to go back and read that it's so powerful when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit I'll call them musicians when the scripture teaches us that the work of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything they surely bring and bear out this truth now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to to the word so good whenever I hear brother randam talk like that it just makes my ears perk up I just think man he wants to make it clear he says it's not according to me and it's not according to you it can't be according to me it can't be according to you it can't be according to a theological Doctrine it can't be according to a a Bible College teaching it can't be according to tradition it can only be according to one thing it's not according to me it's not according to you it has to be according to thus sayeth the Lord or we are falsely LED amen isn't that beautiful it just makes it makes it cut and dried and many people when they have different views on it that it can make them really upset but we're not here to make people upset we're just here to encourage people to get to Christ and the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and the only way we're going to see the true baptism of the holy spirit is to come acord according to the word exactly according to the word not a traditional teaching maybe stand with me as we close brother Bram says to begin with you'll notice that in my meetings when I have finished preaching an evangelic service or some teaching message I cast the net and invite a response from the people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I am inviting people to come come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they are already born again so when I invite those who are spirit filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to God and to believe to speak in tongues this is caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched I think this is so critical brothers and sisters in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same many times it can be split up because of different teachings we can have all manner of teachings mixed in with the message of the hour Traditions Methodist Presbyterian Catholic Pentecostal all manner of traditions can slip in and make it seem like it's something else brothers and sisters it's one in the same that's why brother Barry keeps saying get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters know that you know that you know you got the Holy Ghost because if you got the Holy Ghost you got the inside teacher if you got the Holy Ghost the inside teacher then you're born again God bless you tonight let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word thank you for your word of encouragement Lord yes Lord father you know our hearts we don't worship a man we worship you we know that man chose to tell you one time don't speak L we die but speak to us through the prophet so you said okay that's what will do and you you you change not your Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever why would you ever change your program you haven't done that and we thank you for that Lord this world changes we change but you never change and father tonight I pray that you would just help each one of us Lord Jesus to just align ourselves with this unchanging word with your unchanging ways with your unchanging sacrifice Lord to know what you've done for us Lord it truly is humbling it truly causes something to stir inside our very souls to just want to worship you to give you praise and glory father to go and find that last predestinated seed to sigh and cry for the Abominations in the land it's not just enough to say Amen to the word but Lord to look around at this world oh Father it's falling apart all around us and we're so thankful that you said that Lord you would stop time you would shorten the days father so that flesh could be saved and we know that just any day now you're going to take your bride out of here and we just pray that we could align ourselves with your word with your truth father that we could Lord Jesus consecrate ourselves fresh every single day be looking and wondering is today the day because one of these days it will happen and we thank you for that promise Lord we just want to commit each life into your hands now as we go our separate ways help us to consider the words that were spoken tonight father you would not have us ignorant concerning these things and we thank you for that Lord we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing hold to God's unchanging hand [Music] time is filled with swift transition god of Earth
