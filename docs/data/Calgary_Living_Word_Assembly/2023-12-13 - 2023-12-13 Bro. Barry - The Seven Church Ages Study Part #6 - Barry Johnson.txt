ask you to turn to Malachi chapter 4 felt this one scripture would be suiting as we're going through the the revelation of Jesus Christ and the exposition of the seven Church ages thank you tonight brother faren for the special and everyone who continually brings specials it does something special Malachi chter 4 verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God bless you tonight you may be seated as the Lord adds a blessing to the reading of his word word just a couple of announcements we have brother Cadre Diggs coming in on Friday he'll take the service Saturday night at 6 o' Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m. we have a Youth Event coming up on the on the Sunday after the service and uh I do believe there's opportunity for those who need rides to arrange for them if you need a ride uh please reach out and I'm sure that can be arranged and then we will have the blessing of brother Emanuel taking the service for us on the 27th I do believe that's still on the horizon is that right brother amen so we uh we're certainly excited to see what the lord has laid upon his heart amen it's been a while and uh you know it's exciting when you hear um the report about how the Sunday school has been talking about what we actually talk about in the service up here and sometimes it's the entire uh subject of the service and sometimes it's just brushing over it but rest assured that brother Emanuel and I don't uh compare notes um before Sunday school and before service and maybe we should I I don't know but maybe we shouldn't because we can look at it and say it's a supernatural element it's truly the Lord you know I had a brother say to me on Sunday that you know that exact quote you read about the the sour and the Sweet Apple is a quote that I read just today and you know that's the Lord there's no way that that happens just by accident some might say it's coincidence the devil would say it's just coincidence the world would say it's coincidence but you know the spirit and the bride they say the same thing so anyways we uh we're looking forward to seeing what the Lord has in store it'll be a good weekend this weekend and uh it's always a wonderful time of fellowship with brother Cadre he's been a real encouragement and friend to me and I'm just excited to see him again yes um it looks like it's going to be an interesting year for uh Ministry the the the brothers are reaching out and is wanting to travel so we we might have another couple of Brothers coming this uh this summer and it could be real interesting we definitely have brother Andrew Glover confirmed and uh I'm not sure what the date is but we can certainly confirm that if anybody has a question by all means just let me know I I apologize olze because tonight I have a bit of a cough and I'm likely going to be doing that quite a bit so if you'll bear with me I'll try and not cough in your ear but for those people who uh have the revelation of Jesus Christ with them tonight in the exposition of the seven Church ages uh for those people who don't we're just going to continue on reading last time we left off with uh I believe it's paragraph 50 in the exposition of the seven Church ages out of the revelation of Jesus Christ and you know the the discussion is such that there's one God and I just love the way that the prophet brings it out in here now that I mentioned it I'm going to cough like crazy it's oh my goodness maybe it's a bad confession rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Amen we'll just get into this word here yes last time we talked about it how um there's no baptism in the Bible in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost that's not Christian baptism right and we know that that changed after uh after the Catholic Church got in and uh there's nowhere documented in the Bible where they baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost the Great Commission was to go and baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost we'll get into it tonight brother bradam talks about it how the disciples that were with Jesus they knew jesus' name isn't that wonderful to know jesus' name I thought boy could just take a whole sermon and talk about how incredible it is just to know jesus' name kind of like we talked about tonight you know when the spirit speaks to the the age that age has an ear there's a group of people that have an ear to hear what the spirit says not everyone has the ability to hear what the spirit says and it's uh it's a beautiful thing because it it it demonstrates that there's different different classes of people and it's according to election according to for knowledge it it's not something that we could even choose to do if we wanted to last time we spoke about the godhead and this uh probably the last time this time and maybe even the next time will be basically uh talking about the godhead and I think it's just a beautiful discussion because uh many times people make it so incredibly difficult and so incredibly convoluted and confusing you know the godhead is Christ in you the hope of glory that truly is the godhead when that settles when that can actually become I would say the fundamental Foundation of your faith then you have the opportunity to begin to understand what the godhead truly is that it's just one God he's manifesting in three different manifestations I mean we could have a a a a public office in the City of Calgary I could go and potentially get a bunch of people to vote for me maybe they wouldn't but if I did just for the sake of example I wanted to be the the mayor of the City of Calgary I could become the mayor of the City of Calgary but I couldn't sign a check in the name mayor City of Calgary it would get returned at the bank how could you baptize in the name of the father or the son or the Holy Ghost it just doesn't make sense once you see it it just doesn't make sense it's like walking into a room we used to do the renovations and paint touchups and when you have a spot on the wall you might not see it ever you could walk in and out of that room your whole entire life but when somebody walks in for the first time and they say Do you ever see that spot on the wall there well now it's ruined because you're going to see it every time you walk in that room you're going to look at that it's kind of like that with the word of God you come to that place where you actually get the ability to see it and once you see it you can't unsee it but it's a revelation it's a gift from God Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal that to people right it's so beautiful but even Paul you know being being a scholar he didn't have the opportunity to have another experience did he I was just considering this since the last time we talked how interesting it is Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever how Paul persecuted the church laid it to waste those were his words but what happened when he was on his road to Damascus and and we all know it so obvious and and I I apologize if it's tough on a Wednesday night maybe we'll try and shake out of the out of the first gear that I feel like I'm in right now um but Paul he met the pillar of fire for himself he didn't meet a scholar on the road no no someone didn't try and persuade him someone didn't try and talk him into this new gospel of Jesus Christ Christ came to him personally exactly the way that he had had learned about his whole entire life and that's why he comes the same yesterday today and forever but I just thought it was wonderful because it wasn't a different type of experience it was through the pillar of fire and Paul was very familiar with that the pillar of fire experience he knew that was God that's how Jehovah dealt with the fathers while they were in the wilderness but he met that Pillar of Fire for himself and it was exactly according to the Old Testament scriptures and he knew that but even once he realized that once Paul got that Revelation for himself that this is sounding familiar to what I've been taught he didn't just rely upon that experience to be knocked down off his horse to be blind to go into the city to have someone named annias pray for you tell him to pray for you and you'll actually have your vision restored and then have this man have the same thing told to him and both of them coming together he he didn't rely on that he didn't say praise God I've got this Revelation now of the word for my day and I'm just going to go forwards and be be the the prophet to the age being a scholar being a a Pharisee of Pharisees what did he do he said I count all that I thought I knew was dung and I got to go out into Arabia now for three years and I've got to seek this out for myself because I can't rely on an experience to say whether I've got the word of God or not whether it was truly God that's met me and that's why brothers and sisters I feel so I guess emphatic about this we got to be very careful to not say because we've had a great experience of Supernatural miracles happen in our midst that's God sure it is but are you able to live the word because that's where the rubber meets the road if we can't live the word then something's wrong we're no different than any denomination out there in the world right but Paul got this Revelation and he had to go on the back side of the desert and we know brother brandham says it that no Minister should be ministering until they've had a backside of the desert experience and that is a complete change change of thinking that's a complete change of tradition that's a complete change of everything that we thought we knew when when our parents behaved a certain way that's good for them because that's them but what about me my experience for with God is what counts today that's what God's going to look for he's not going to say why you've got the exact same experience as your daddy as your mommy God's not going to do that he's going to say you got to have your own experience I need to know you personally for myself you need to know me personally but then Paul goes back to Jerusalem after his three years in the desert and what does he do he meets Peter and suddenly they're speaking the same language they're preaching the same gospel but they've never met before how are they doing that it's Revelation by the spirit it's proving that it's the word of God and that he has worked on both ends and now these men have the word for their day you know in Galatians 1:15 it says but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace my goodness excuse me to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood now I just want to point out that word heathen it doesn't mean complete rank unbelievers it means non-jews that's what that word means so we're not talking about people who are ranked Sinners here we're talking about people who aren't Jews so the Gentiles and immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood I didn't just rely on my own senses like we talked about on Sunday the senses will lie to us brother bradam said Paul said immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were the apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus he went back to where this experience happened he went back to investigate it you know in the in the Hebrew series brother bradam talks about this real good he goes really good and deep into this this and talks about it and how important it is for us to have our own experience and our own experience needs to be based on the word it can't just be a supernatural happening in our life because the devil can impersonate any gift of God except for the word except for the ability to believe the word that's why that's the only true evidence of having the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is the ability to accept the word to receive the word for our Day verse 18 says then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days this was Jesus Christ God manifest in the human body the same yesterday today and forever we had have to see the same thing in our lives brothers and sisters taking a look at this now based on all of that we know that we can't rely on on these experiences Supernatural experiences to say that we've got the word although they follow the word of God the super natural stuff will follow but seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen I think it's just a an amazing study here that we're going through and it just gets me excited when I I I read a paragraph and it's like a kid in the candy shop and I just can't help myself and I apologize because I guess I talk a lot about this but you know brother bradam I I'll just do a couple paragraph recap 48 in this uh exposition of the seven Church ages out of the revelation of Jesus Christ he says you don't just B apz in jesus' name there's thousands of Jesus in the world right and have been even more Jesus and have been even before Jesus our savior but there's only one of them born Christ Lord Jesus Christ people talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son of God now isn't that a contradiction who ever heard of a son being Eternal sons have Beginnings but that which is eternal never had a beginning he is the Eternal god Jehovah manifested in flesh in St John's gospel it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us yes he was the true and faithful witness to the father's Eternal Word he was the true and faithful witness to the father's Eternal Word Jesus Christ God's Tabernacle in flesh amen he was a prophet and could say what the father bade him say he said my father is in me this is what Jesus the Tabernacle said my father is excuse me in Me God has many titles I just think this is so good our righteousness our peace and everpresent and Father and Son and Holy Ghost but he has only one human name and that name is Jesus amen amen I remember when this Revelation settled into my heart it was so clear brother Logan was young still is but he was younger and I remember sitting on the on the back patio at brother Ken and sister Shel at scanon place and I was talking to brother Ken and brother Blaine Wahlberg about this very topic and and it just became so Crystal Clear to me it was so evident so real that he only had one human name I I don't know when the Lord gives you Revelations it's amazing it's just you remember the time you remember the place you remember the smells you remember the people you remember when it's a revelation it's so real he has one human name and that is Jesus amen we've all got lots of different titles some of us get many different titles in our lives but we only have one name true and you know isn't it interesting if you start to get different names they're called Ali aliases not aliases they're called aliases and I believe in certain places if not everywhere it's illegal to start doing that it's an impersonation you can't have multiple names you can't have one name on a passport and another name on a driver's license and another name on a marriage certificate and another name on a bank account you can't do that you can't do that with titles you have to have your name who are you yes paragraph 53 don't be confused because he has three offices or that he has three has a three-fold manifestation on Earth he was a prophet in heaven he is the priest and coming back to Earth he is the king of kings he that was that is Jesus the prophet he that is that is he the high priest making inter intercession one who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities which is to come that is the coming King on Earth he was the word the prophet Moses said of him the prophet a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every Soul who will not hear that prophit shall be destroyed from among the people Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know today we can look at this and say well there's lots of people that just you know hear the word of the prophet and just do their own thing with it or maybe just disregard it entirely or maybe can't even hear it they think it's crazy it's Madness but they still live and they get by you know I I believe it's in the book of Hab cck the Lord said just consider their end yeah don't don't look at them right now in their circumstances but consider what the end of them is going to be I I we're in a a a loner car our vehicle's in the shop and we have the luxury of satellite radio and so it's it's kind of interesting to see all the different channels that are on there and and I know people are saying where you going with this brother Barry there's a channel for America's Pastor Billy Graham and so rather than all the rubbish that's on there I just put it on there and just let it play and I I listen and think about the way he's talking and think you know the prophet for our day for our age spoke about this man we we had the the the blessing of actually going and seeing the library and how he impacted the world and you know World evangelist American Pastor that's what they called him and it's just incredible to see the anointing of of those two witnesses that went down to Sodom is what our Prophet said right and to hear him speak he was talking today I was driving and I just I just heard him talk about how there's coming a day where there's going to be sheep and there's going to be goats a and which one are you a and you're going to be standing before that throne and he's just hammering this just saying it with such anointing and conviction and I'm thinking boy oh boy I'm not one of those I'm neither I'm going to be with him in his throne I just couldn't help but think I got to talk about that tonight we're not going to have to stand before his throne if we have the ability to receive this word but that's what many people are believing they're going to stand before his throne we had a Prophet come and say that you're you're not you're not guilty you never did it in the first place just incredible but don't be confused because he has three offices oh sorry I need to carry on paragraph 54 notice these facts about Jesus on Earth he was a prophet lamb and son this did not make him three these were but manifestations or offices of the one person Jesus why now there's a very favorite portion of scripture that the trinitarians think proves their point of more than one actual person in the godhead and behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four be and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints Revelations 5 6 to8 paragraph 56 says yes indeed these verses if isolated would seem to prove their point you notice I said these isolated verses however read on and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in the sight in sight like unto an emerald and when those beasts give their glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things in for thy pleasure they are and were created Revelations 42:3 and 9-11 now he goes on to say carefully note in verse two it says one not two or three one sat on the throne in verse three it says he not they was to look upon as a jasper stone in verse n it says that the Beast gave honor to him not them in verse 10 it says that the elders fell down before him not them in verse 11 it says that they cried Thou Art Worthy oh Lord not Lords also in verse 11 it says this one on the throne was the creator which is Jesus John 1:3 which is Jehovah Spirit god of the Old Testament Genesis 1:1 but let us not stop there read on to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God you know we can read that with Revelation revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne I I just wonder where uh you know I'll say brother Billy Graham was with that scripture how that could just be omitted or or not talked about right we know that it wasn't his anointing to to speak about it but it just somebody has to fulfill that scripture yes and I'll go back to the scripture that we started with tonight that that has just been ringing true in my heart for the last few months verse 5 of Malachi chter 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet I'll send you Elijah the prophet he's going to send Elijah the prophet to somebody somebody has to be able to perceive that there's a prophet yes amen when is that going to happen I would just throw it out there for people that say maybe what we talk about we believe is kind of out there and it's not according to the theological teachings okay let's just try and rationalize it then if it hasn't happen when is it going to the word of God says that I'll send you Elijah the prophet yes I mean know some people will say well that was potentially John the Baptist and we don't want to go too far into that but I just can't help but say you know when I read that word you that means me I will send you Elijah the prophet he sent me Elijah the prophet it's just beautiful carrying on carrying on in our discussion here out of the exposition of the seven Church ages paragraph 56 says indeed these verses uh yes indeed these verses if isolated would seem to prove their point uh no no sorry I just feel off today I apologize I do I know that uh it's just the way it is sometimes in this human flesh that we're in but I haven't taken any uh anything for it so I know we're at paragraph 58 here know the devil just wants to mix it up too because this is the truth this is the word amen amen paragraph 58 says notice that according to Jesus himself who wrote wrote in the Revelation he is set down with the father sorry I missed Hebrews 122 we're going to go back and read that it's after Revelations 3:21 in this book here he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith we read that on Sunday WHo for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God and I'm going to throw this in there for you and me he took all of our shame he took it to the cross and and now he's sitting down on the right hand of the father in the power seat with the father for us just holding the seat for us when we actually go to the other side it's a beautiful thing now paragraph 58 notice that according to Jesus himself who wore who wrote in Revelation he is set down with the Father the spirit in Paul which spirit is the spirit of Christ for that is the spirit of of Prophecy whereby the word comes says he is sat down at the right hand of God but when John looked he saw only one upon the throne why didn't he see him sitting down beside the throne and it was not until Revelations 56-8 which follows revelations 42-3 in sequence of time that we see the lamb taking the book from him that sat on the throne as indicated in Revelations 42:3 and 9-10 what is it it is the mystery of one God he Jesus came out from God became manifested in flesh died and rose again and returned to the bosom of the father as John said in chapter 1 and verse 18 the only begotten son son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him we know the disciples said show us the father and it will suffice and and he said to him have I been with you that long haven't I been with you so long and you still don't actually understand you don't perceive who is actually with you but it's it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed and uh I I just think it's so beautiful we can take it for granted that we understand that and I apologize if it seems Elementary that I just labor on it but I just think there's there's so much in here it's like mining every every time you go a little further something just pops up and you can polish it a little bit and talk about it some more it's fantastic paragraph 59 it was now time for God Messiah to to come back to claim his bride and then present himself make himself known to Israel thus we see God again stepping forth to assume a physical relationship to man as the son of David king of kings and Lord of lords and bridegroom of the Gentile bride hallelujah it's not two Gods but simply one God manifesting his mighty Triune offices and titles the people knew he was a prophet they knew the sign of the Messiah which would come only through the prophet now Philip was of besida the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto him we have found him of whom most Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph the natural senses just identifying him bringing him to a a way they could comprehend and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto him come and see yeah come and see for yourself Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no gu Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee Nathaniel answered and saith unto him Rabbi art thou Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus a answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man that's John 1:44 to 51 now we're going to get into kind of what I had thought would be a real good place just to sort of dwell for the last part of the service tonight and that is the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men it's a tremendous thing because we know that the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men is not something that me men can do it's not telepathy it's not uh anything man-made it's truly the spirit of God but he says here in paragraph 61 the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men made the elect of God to understand that here was the Messiah the anointed word of God and we we know that it says here Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the defining aunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart this scripture clearly identifies that the word of God goes beyond our comprehension it goes all beyond all of our natural senses beyond the the the bones and the flesh our Flesh and Blood even our spiritual realm it goes beyond all of that goes right down to the very heart of men and we know that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he right into the very control center of a human being's life that's what the word of God does it's quick and powerful and sharper it it's quick it has life power the the word of God the Throne of of power and is sharper than any any two-edged sword it it will go anywhere it can discern anything there's nothing that will stop the word of God it's so beautiful amen I love that thought we could probably just preach a whole sermon on that Hebrews 4:12 but you know I I I just want to get into sort of where we left off last week and and and push forward a little bit we ended with the scripture in Colossians chapter 2 verse 8 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ how would we know whether something is actually being presented in such a way that it's going to be after the traditions of men or after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ it's a real simple answer brothers and sisters and we all know it I know it but I'm just going to say it and and that's simple it will go with the word from the Vindicated Prophet it will be right in line line with what the Vindicated Prophet said and if it doesn't go right in line with what the Vindicated Prophet said then it is going to be vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ notice when Paul we talked about at the very beginning of the topic tonight when he went up to Jerusalem he didn't go to the scholars he went to the Brethren he went to Peter he went to the the ignorant and the unlearned he went to the Believers he didn't go to the religious people he didn't go to the Seminary teachers and we know that's one thing that brother bradam did in his life didn't he when he first started to have the experiences he he went to see the the the the pastor of the church that he was attending and what did he tell them he said you know it's of the devil it's not according to the the the the philosophy that we taught that we teach it's not according to our vain deceit he didn't say that but it's not according to our Traditions it's of the devil you need to forget about what you're talking about an angel saying that you're going to go you go and pray for kings and potentates verse N9 says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily speaking about Jesus Christ and ye are complete in him isn't that beautiful you're complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision not made circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of Flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead the quickening power but you know brother bradam in our our our our age he said there's many people that claim bride bride Revival Revival but he says it there has to be one there has to be one that has the mechanics that the Dynamics comes to and when that happens brothers and sisters something's going to happen we're not going to be able to sit still we're not going to be able to come to a song service and just say I'm just upset about this thing and not worship we're going to push it all aside when we come through those doors and we're going to just give the Lord the glory that he desires we can't wait to worship him but you know I just think it's beautiful we don't want to be beguiled it says beware lest any man spoil you we have to beware we've got to be wise as serpents but harmless as doves just recognize and I think that you know the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men there's a correlation in the word of God with the word that we have for our day talking about the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men that's not something that anybody can do people will try and impersonate it but when it's God it's going to be 100% accuracy every single time according to Hebrews the the scripture that we read Hebrews 4:12 but there is a correlation to this and I think it's good just to maybe go back a little bit and talk about it once I'm done coughing and that is in Exodus chapter 4 maybe you want to turn with me tonight as we spend the last few minutes Exodus chapter 4 he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Exodus chapter 4 verse one talking about the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men Exodus 4:1 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice is that right I don't know if that's right sorry I've got a few different types of notes here and I just want to make sure that I'm not misleading bear with me Exodus chapter 4 yeah and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice why we know that he's already had the call from the Lord the burning bush he's given him the the direction to come closer take off your shoes it's it's God giving him the commission here and Moses answering him they will not hear believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee yeah and the Lord said unto him what is in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers and the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob hath appeared unto to thee so I'll give you a sign verse six and the Lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thine bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was lepus as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter signs and it shall come to pass that if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land excuse me and we know I'm not going to go too much further with this Moses he says Lord I'm not eloquent I I don't know how I can do this I stutter I I I don't feel qualified my feelings My Flesh my senses and we know God says you know you don't understand any of this you've been called you know step up you're going to do this yes amen but what I want to get to is there is a correlation with this to what we're talking about tonight the ability to discern the thoughts that are in the hearts of men God calling someone and giving them a commission and saying that I'll give you a sign to capture the attention of the people so that they will understand that this is more than just a man this is more than just a Ministry this is God and and I'm just going to read a couple of quotes here the first one uh is how the angel came to me in his Commission in 1955 just to bring a little bit bit of a a background to to what we're reading and and and the the Scribe that God chose to actually write this book here paragraph 153 he I said looked at him like that he's talking about speaking to the angel of the Lord coming to him and giving him his commission he saido not fear the angel said to him just as quiet said I am sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth as you know what my birth was up there that same light hung over me when I was first born and so he said your peculiar birth and misunderstood life has been to indicate that you're to go to all the world to pray for the sick people and said and regardless of what they have and he designated God who's my judge knows that he designated cancer said nothing if you get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer Hallelujah see if you get the people to believe you I could pause there and just just let that so isn't that beautiful if you can get the people to believe you yes that's why we follow the the word of a Vindicated Prophet not because we want to see cancer annihilated but we do but we want to see the Lord give us the power to overcome in this world we need healing for our bodies Here and Now not over in the Millennium but if you can get the people to believe not even cancer will stand in the way of your prayers my goodness amen I was just thinking about it today when I was studying it not even cancer was will stand in the way of your prayers how can cancer stand in the way of a prayer it's a devil it just created a visual for me that I thought was real interesting and and that is that every time we pray is there a devil trying to stand in the way is it trying to jump in the path of our prayer trying to hinder our prayers from getting to the throne just because the way this is worded is the only reason I started to think about it it will stand in the way of your prayer what I know we live in the natural we we see it with our senses you know it's it's it's cancer that gets in our body and and and we have to deal with it that way but it just made me think about it there's a spiritual element to this as well we know it's a devil and I seen he wasn't my enemy the angel of the Lord he was my friend and I didn't know whether I was dying or or what was happening when he was coming up to me like that and I said well sir I said I am what did I know about healings and things like that those gifts I said well sir I am a poor man in interesting dialogue hey similar to what Moses said if you were to go away probably should have read it but for time's sake I just wanted to get into this similar discussion though we we start to look at ourselves and say how could I ever do this and and and it's great because we can't nobody ever can that's right it's got to be God living out through us he says well sir I'm I'm a poor man and I said I'm I'm among my people I live with my people who is poor I'm uneducated and I said I I would not be able they'd not they'd not understand me said they wouldn't they wouldn't hear me just about exactly the same dialogue and he said as the prophet Moses was given two gifts signs rather to vindicate his ministry so will you be given to so are you given two gifts to vindicate your ministry he said one of them will be that you will take the person that you're praying for by the hand with your left hand and their right and said then just stand quiet and it'll there will be a physical effect that will happen on your body and said then you'll pray and if it leaves the disease is gone from the people and if it doesn't leave just ask a blessing and walk away well I said sir I'm afraid they won't receive me he said and the next thing will be didn't even hear him didn't even discuss that with them just simply said this is going to happen and you're going to do it he said the next thing will be that they if they won't hear that then they will hear this said then it'll come to pass that you'll know the very secret of their heart said this they will hear and you know now we're getting into where we wanted to get to the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men made the elect of God to understand that here was the Messiah the anointed word of God talking about the disciples but what about today Hallelujah this is the sign of the Messiah brothers and sisters we had a prophet in our age say I'm here to declare he's here we know that we're going to see him in the clouds that's going to happen yes but first there's a word coming amen and we're experiencing that we're experiencing the appearing of Jesus Christ and we know then the coming that's happening I'm not going to try and get into that tonight but what I want to say is that there's a real real correlation here to the ability to discern the heart thoughts of men and how we talk about the prophet it's no different than the prophet Moses and how he was called and told he would be given two signs and some people the carinal mind would say say well he's just impersonating that but really A A A ministry that's been Vindicated by God went around the world seven times how many times was there a Miss in in in the discernments in the healings how many times was there not one nobody can bring forth proof that someone didn't actually get healed exactly according to the word of God with this ministry thousands hundreds of thousands of people healed Believers unbelievers people got healed that's just the way it was right but there was a transition in his ministry and we'll probably wind up spending the last 10 minutes on that and that was in Regina Saskatchewan Hallelujah and I believe it was in 1950 I I could be wrong it was real close to that where it changed from just the discernment in in taking someone's hand and being able to heal them and there's there's no question that was a tremendous Ministry but we know I think it was brother Bosworth that said uh it's just simply the bait on the hook it's to get the attention of the people it's to attract the attention of the people to the word to understand that the word of God the sign the true sign of the Messiah is actually here a little bit later on it's actually the next paragraph brother Bram he tells this story over and over and over again in his ministry the story of the woman at the well yes Amen in the messages when that woman saw this man sitting there discern her very thoughts her very heart her problems and her troubles in her life something happened in her and we know that she recognized it she was taught there would be a messiah who would be able to do that he would be a prophet and because of that sign she was able to discern it and go and tell everyone hey come see a man who's told me the things that I've done the next quote is a little bit of a long one hopefully it won't keep us uh I I'm just trying to find it excuse me it's out of Moses 1950 0110 comes up at the bottom I uh got stimulated before we got in here and it's wonderful when the Lord does that brother Bram he says well that has come to pass talking about the first part of his ministry being able to take someone by the hand that has come to pass and then the next one is the Discerning of the heart thoughts of men well that has come to pass it was standing at Calgary or at Regina Saskatchewan last about 3 months ago and I was standing on the platform talking like this to my audience we were having a great meeting some I guess close to 10,000 people were gathered in for that night at the Pavilion can you imagine that many people or the queen Gardens it was out where they have the Stampede and I was speaking and I said now the Lord has told me that if I be sincere that someday I did at each meeting it would come to pass that the secrets of people's heart would be told I'll just give you this before we close and I turned around to get a drink on the platform and they was forming a prayer line and when I turned around to get a drink Reverend Mr Baxter my Ian manager I was taking a drink of water and he had taken his handkerchief and was wiping the perspiration off of my forehead he said God bless you brother brandom I said thank you brother Baxter I turned around he walked around and there stood a lady standing by the microphone or been brought up from the prayer line and I walked over like that and as I looked at the lady I said how' he do she said how do he do something happened I knew there was something that happened somewhere I never felt like that before it was that anointing it doesn't feel like the holy spirit it's a real sacred feeling I can't help but think that's where the angel of the Lord stepped into his presence where he got into that place because he said it didn't feel like the Holy Spirit a real sacred feeling and I looked at that woman and she was standing there her regular size and I seen her get real little and start going back now you'll hear that spoke right here and I seen a little bitty girl standing way down where she went down to a little bitty girl of about 12 years old and I seen her sitting by a desk I said something's happening friends I see a little girl that woman left me I said I see a little a little girl she's sitting in the room she's a a school room she's hitting her pencil no it's a pen oh I said I see it Fly and it struck her in the eye and the woman began screaming began to scream it left off she said brother Bram that was me I'm blind in my right eye she said the pen I said well I never had anything like that I said well say and there she went back again I seen a young lady about 16 years old and she was just running as hard as she could she had a big ribbon tied on her hair and a double plate hanging down her back she had on a checker dress and she was running real fast and I looked and there was a big yellow dog chasing her I said I see a young lady with a checkered dress begin to tell just what I was seeing looking in front of me you know only imagine him standing there and just seeing this whole thing play out everybody sees his eyes open he looks like he's normal maybe gazing off into space but here he is telling this whole story telling the woman about the things that she's done who does that I want to say this clearly that was not William Mary and Bram and I would even go further to say you know I question I'll say it whether that was the angel of the Lord I want to say that that was Messiah very Messiah some would say the angel of the Lord but I would say there's only one that sat at the woman sat at the well where came out and talked to the woman and that was the Messiah and he identified himself that way he wanted to be identified exactly that way so who was this here identifying back there oh my and how far are we today today brothers and sisters I see I said I see a young lady with a checker dress begin to tell just what I was seeing looking in front of me I said she goes up on the porch I see a lady there take her in she started screaming she said that was me when I was going to school said I never thought of it before in my life I said something's happening here friends I don't know what's the matter and I started I said let me have your hand sister I took her by the hand and started to I said well I don't feel any vibration from it so the old thing is passing away and I was looking down at her hand and I looked up again and I see a lady coming from a white house or from a red a barn a red looking Barn coming in towards a white house she had an apron holding something like this and she was walking slow and I seen her come I said I see a lady coming I said sister it's you that was the normal time then I could recognize it being the same woman excuse me and I said now I see the lady you've started up the steps and I said there's a flower bed over to your right and the steps goes up like this I said there's something wrong with your back I see you can't get up the steps and I said you lean over sideways and you're crying and I heard her say if I can ever get to brother bram's meeting it'll be over and when I said that somebody caught the woman she started fainting can only imagine what would happen here at this point in the service he she started fainting and when she come to her Blind Eye was normal her back she could just move any she her arthritis was fine she could move her back any way just perfectly normal like that that and I said well something has happened and brother Baxter grabbed the microphone he said brother brandom that's just what you spoke of a while ago would come to pass and everybody began screaming all over the building everywhere I just think it's beautiful that's the spirit of God brothers and sisters I just want to say tonight as we close I'll call the musicians what about today where are we at today we can look back and say that was tremendous that was amazing in the days of the prophet and and and and the services that they had but that was in 1950 here we are this many years later over 50 years later with the opening of the seals the full word completely open before us he's revealed himself entirely intimately I just think it's fantastic it's amazing the ability to discern the heart thoughts in men it made the elect of God to understand that here was the Messiah that was the disciples but also today for the bride it gives the bride the ability to recognize that here is the Messiah the anointed word of God you know brothers and sisters don't look for the Fantastics don't don't look for the tremendous Miracles just let them follow they will they have to they have to just seek ye first the kingdom of God make sure that we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling and we know that God will come on the scene he is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart but you know the the greatest thing today and and I think it just I'm going to close here if you want to stand with me the greatest thing today is the same thing that brother Bram talked about which was the greatest thing in in Martin Luther's day is the ability for Martin Luther to hang hold his head above all of the fanaticism that happened through his ministry and we can look at this message of the hour and Only By God's spirit are we able to stand above all the fanaticism that's gone on in and around this message don't take any man's word for it don't let any man beguile you through vain Traditions or teachings vain philosophies just stick with the word of God stick with the message of the hour and it will all turn out right brothers and sisters let's just go to him and pray prayer as we close tonight our heavenly father Lord tonight we're so thankful for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord we're so thankful that you've given us the ability to hear the word for our day Lord knowing that there's no way that we ever just decided when we were toddlers that we want to find Jesus but Lord before we were even in our mother's womb you chose us even before there was a world before there was a speck of Stardust Lord oh before there was ever an angel you chose us in you amen father to be here as the as the manifested attributes of your spirit in this age Lord Jesus

Believers here in Calgary and we pray that you would just continue to live out through each and every one of us Lord as we go forwards let us be a a shining example of your life to this world let us
