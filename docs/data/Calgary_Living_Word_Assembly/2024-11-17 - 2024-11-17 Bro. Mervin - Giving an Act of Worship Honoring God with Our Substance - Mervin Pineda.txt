[Applause] I [Music] amen amen are you happy you're in the house of the Lord this morning amen so we're privileged Amen to Worship the Lord in spirit and in truth amen so I have two parts of uh presentation or you can say first is the report for the Philippine uh typhoon and flood and uh pretty much it's a video and some pictures maybe you can be seit and then we'll so it will be easy thank you musician so the first uh first PowerPoint brother Josh Philippines report love offering for the typhoon just a check okay all right so so you can see uh we provided love offerings to the Philippines who got affected with this flood you can see it's in CNN and all over the place uh but we are we concentrated on giving some love offerings to to the church there which uh well which we knew and we contacted directly right and uh so you can see it's in CNN some people passed away but praise the Lord some of the or most most of the Saints there are safe and uh we were able to provide some uh relief goods and what not but uh let's put some history on it so severe typhoon you can see there tropical storm Christine that's the name locally and it's inter internationally known as tra so if you if you check in in YouTube or or in the internet you will you will find that the Bol region of the Philippines was hit severely so the storm made landfall on October 23rd 2024 bringing heavy rainfall that led to widespread flooding and landslides across the region the B region particularly the provinces of albai and kamarina Sur so kamarin isur uh the the town is Nawa and the province is kamarin Sur that's where uh the church is uh the name of their church is the house of God the oh the house of God's word yeah th HG W yeah yeah and their Pastor is brother Ryan Mendoza and I've been in contact with him uh in Facebook and yeah he gave me all the pictures they are not from the internet so they came from him directly the B region particularly the provinces of albai and kamarina experienced significant flooding as early as October 21st 2024 due to the storm's slow approach and intense rainfall the severe weather conditions persisted for several days causing extensive damage and loss of life so you can see the Philippines for those who already went there so this is Manila here and this is Palawan but this is where Nawa is it's in the the eastern part it's in the middle you see Philippines has 7,700 Islands including uninhabited ones so but uh you can see it's prone to typhoons and storms but wherever you go the only uh Pro safe place is in the Lord right it's in the Lord Jesus Christ wherever you go we we also experience flooding flooding here in 2013 we experience fire here we experience wars in the Middle East wherever you go there's nothing safe that's why we need to go away from from this Earthly uh from this Earth amen so this is the you can see the the full Philippines there almost then I a little bit zoomed in so that's where NAB here right oh previous previous to that there there's a previous one are there on two there bear with me okay yeah that's where it is you can see this is where we went Kuran before with the with the Johnson's you can see how far it is we we stayed in Manila and this is our home in Angela City this is uh sister uh the aqu Queens live sister uh Judith yeah sister Judith uh brother Cyrus uh sister Zen this is their place we're we're a bit close maybe around 1 and a half hour away right and uh yeah so that's where Nawa is this is this is the location here so even further you can see so it's close to the to the shore also so that's why they experience a lot of flooding so before the typhoon and the flood that's their Church chur typically while they're waiting for the flood at least they gathered and then you can see they have some good uh fellowships there that's their Church yeah you can see no no flood there all good they have a good church amen they were blessed so you can see that's the entrance of door of the church and they have this vehicle which totally submerged and it's totally wrecked right now that's what the brother they use this to to transport Believers because uh you know in the Philippines if you were there it's difficult to go from one place to place without a vehicle and this is totally submerged and it's not working it's totally wrecked they have three vehicles in the church they use for for the ministry they are all gun and the other two with the brothers they're also gun so yeah let's pray for them but for us we cannot help everyone we cannot meet all the needs of the whole wide world right so we we can only help what what is before us amen so we're not trying to ask or pull money it's just this is an opportunity for us it's not a burden it's an opportunity to help because when you help you'll be given uh abundantly multiple folds amen so during the flood and the typhoon so miles oh do you have sound brother brother CH Church Ros for so you the the church before that's where uh where the V was chch Church main CM second floor around 12T of first [Music] chch so it's good thing that the dogs are rescued not the human beings so we're we're thankful still amen so so you can see the the effect of that tropical storm amen so next slide brother you can go with that the next slide now yeah okay so these are pictures now this is during the or uh after the typhoon and the flooding amen so you can see there that's the video that uh they took so you see all totally submerged amen uh this is their church after the flooding which they evacuated they use the Strong Tower which is the church good thing that it's founded on Solid Rock of stones and concrete yeah okay this is Bayan NG NAA means town of nabua it's totally submerged almost you can say yeah all right uh you'll see the good Smiles of Filipino people in despite of the the flooding and everything that's maybe that's why you can see us always smiling maybe when you're even when talking but uh yeah we'll try to be Canadians maybe and I don't know I'm just yeah okay so so yeah some of the Pastors in Lon went there I think we met them brother Berry this is brother dondon and brother Val they and this is the pastor brother Ryan and this is one of the deacons of brother Bal so they went there after the flood then they they also help of course this one is uh world news right so they ask for help also from from other from other churches which is good that's why we are here we we belong to the mystical body right we don't only sit here and be fat in the word or or be fat in what we receive financially we we extend we're stewards amen okay first service after the church they were able to you know you know how it goes uh despite of what happens you wanted to go to the uh to the to the house of the Lord amen and they were able to do that maybe a week after the flood yeah okay yeah he was able to preach so this is the the thing about the report so it's a love offering from Calgary Living Word assembly us amen so you can see we sent them sub substantial amount I won't mention but uh you know how it goes you gave it and uh we're so thankful even from the small kids I won't mention who but you will see the the the amount that you provided went like this they bought some good stuff right and it's not that cheap also there maybe half price some right like rice I've been talking to my wife it's 50% off compared there but we have jasmine rice which is the the good one but there they they're able to to live with a little bit of less quality but it go it goes uh maybe 50 to $60 for a 50 caban uh 50 kilogram of rice right so but here we have 8 kilos $20 so it means it's more than double basically so they yeah I think this might be the the wife of brother uh Ryan so you see uh they bought a lot of rice in Philippines as long as you have rice you're good you can have only you know soy sauce maybe or salt or or maybe sugar then you'll make it work this is survival for them right and then they were so thankful when we contacted brother Ryan he was so thankful and then they were all crying and they're they're so thankful amen so you see for us This Is War can goods or War food but for them it's a luxury right because uh yeah yeah so you can see soap uh they they need to clean up uh you know Downey detergents milk right so canned goods coffee right three in one I know the Johnson the Johnson kids love three in one so yeah this one is yeah oops so you can see the brothers and sisters helping to distribute it's just like the the time of the Pentecost when they put all things together and then you know distribute uh evenly amen not uh not one benefiting only right it's for everyone so they they did this more than 50 families were were uh or benefited from this lab offerings this is just only from us okay they might have others but this one is immediately when I sent the money he went there with the you know I'll show you how the transportation there they are just using tricycle because the thing is it's flooded most of their vehicles are all flooded so it's a it's a it's a it's a bit uh uh difficult times uh for them amen okay and you can see so you see the bags that they provided plus the rice amen and these are the recipients okay uh I want to finish quickly but uh these are your recipients of of Your Love uh offering brothers and sisters so that you will see that we're not putting money on our pockets or whoever right so we we sent it directly okay so this is the one I'm talking about they've been delivering because some they cannot go anywhere so they have to you know use this kind of uh uh transport to to give it to to the Believers and not only Believers by the way he asked for permission can I ask the family that are not yet attend uh that are not yet baptized and not yet Believers but we want to be a blessing to them because they also stayed in their church I told him by all means brother this gospel is not only for the Believers we are here so that we can be stewards of what is given to us amen so you can see so yeah so these are the recipients you can see more than 50 families brothers and sisters for this little thing that we gave amen for us maybe it's just 40 Mor tons right or but for them it's it's life it extended their life yeah to help them amen so GL God bless you for that uh may the Lord richly bless you amen now we can go to preaching and teaching and it's related to that because we're giving amen giving as an act of worship honoring God with our substance amen and uh I know it looks like it's a finance week this week amen we have the spiritual we have the natural amen and we're so thankful we we just need to to uh recognize the gifts amen and uh we need to do it according to the word amen according to his leadership and we'll be good I mean uh not being good will be great because we are blessed amen beyond measure so this will be a a bit of a study teaching and preaching amen tithes offerings and missions and uh uh and whatever it is because uh yeah we've been talking about this me and Barberry like being the treasurer it's good that uh I'm not saying that it's not good if it comes from a pastor to to preach on ties and offerings but typically it's a it's a subject that is a little bit uh touchy because they might think the pastor wanted the money right no no it's it's a commandment of the Lord amen and uh just with a little gift that is that he placs in us I put uh good uh good verses or all the verses are good amen and uh they are inspired and uh we have also the quotes from bar Branham and it will be a a good uh way to to do this as a study so it will be a two two parts wherever we finish I don't want to take lots of time because I have only one hour and uh we have presentation so we can continue if I won't finish amen so please stand to your feet Let's uh read the Proverbs 3 9 to8 for the sake of time uh I already put the the script ures right so that uh it will be we don't waste time Proverbs 3:9-10 King James version honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of the all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy pressence shall burst out with new wine let's bow our hearts oh Lord Jesus want to thank you for the reading of your word Lord may you reach it that it will be a benefit for the hearers including myself I just want to put myself out of out of the way so that you can uh you can use me completely oh God we love you we adore you we glorify your name in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated amen so Proverbs 3:9-10 amen you can see my title uh for this part is giving as an act of worship honoring God with our substance but then at first we know giving giving but then what is worship we always say even in the prayers we worship worship worship amen so by definition Noah Webster 1828 dictionary so I want to use uh this dictionary as well because uh because it looks like language evolves so but uh at the same time uh we want to go with the original as much as possible amen so definition it's a noun because in this Con in this context it is used as a noun but uh worship is also a verb amen so chiefly and eminently the act of paying Divine honors to the Supreme Being paying okay I emphasize paying because we pay tithes we although BR Bram all the scriptures say give tithes but uh we pay because it's not ours we owe the Lord amen or the reverence and homemade paid to him again again paying so it's a sacrifice when you're paying it's a sacrifice Amen in religious exercises consisting in adoration confession prayer Thanksgiving and the like amen so you can can see amen uh worship is a profound Act of aligning ourselves with the Divine expressing love adoration and admission to God what does that mean we align ourselves with the Lord we align with what the Lord means the word we align with the word and then not only aligning we have to express it so that's why what we did love offering for the Philippines is an expression of love of God through us so that we can you know through our little Financial uh contributions we were able to help other people especially the bride there amen so it transcends goes beyond physical actions amen as it originates from the heart amen which is where the soul lives or where the soul is located by Bram is saying to our mind which is our spirit so from inside out so it's so when it is expressed we already know that we are aligned according to the word amen so the biblical Foundation uh of worship this is this is a foundation amen he described it in uh John 42324 for us worshiping in spirit and in truth amen emphasizing what sincerity and alignment with God's word so we that's why bar Bram is saying help me to be more sincere imagine a prophet saying that amen how about us are we are we sincere enough to to to to focus on God Amen so you can say it places God at the center glorifying his attributes will and works what are his attributes he's God he's an object of worship he's a provider he's a he's a Healer all those attributes we we glorify his attributes amen because we we believe that he's God Amen and the good thing also is this is worship is a way of life what does that mean is not limited to rituals of church services amen it involves living in obedience and love towards God not only every week but daily amen every minute every hour of our our being we need to dedicate it for worship that's what he wanted the reason why we come here together is to worship Him amen and there are forms of worship individual worship Prayer by yourself right because uh it's a personal relationship with the Lord we need that we meditate and we need to study the word amen uh personal Bible study is a it's an individual worship but we can have also group worship or Collective one which is we do prayer meetings congregational singing the sermons preaching what we do to here it's a group worship but the lifestyle worship is the is the important ones because we only have two Services every week but the lifestyle we need to reflect God's nature through our actions amen integrity and compassion and concern for others and we're so thankful we have this ability to to to to share not only financially but Also spiritually we are witnesses to our colleagues to our schoolmates to our classmates to our friends to our families let's not go very far because our families they might not be believing yet or serving the lord now but they are our promises there we don't need to worry amen amen so so worship it's a foundation right uh it seeks a relationship with the Creator personal relationship with the Creator that's why what's the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally amen it's a relationship with the Creator which is the Lord himself engaging both the heart which is our Soul and Spirit which is the mind to glorify him be be Beyond the human comprehension so there's a supernatural in it amen worship is Supernatural it's spiritual amen so in essence true worship flows from acknowledging God's Supremacy so when you acknowledge that God is supreme Sovereign is God is everything then we express that acknowledgment through every aspect of Our Lives that's why every fiber of our being must be towards the worship of God Amen so that's that's the introduction for this or you can say uh so when we talk about uh uh bear with me here Proverbs 39 to10 okay so what what the scripture is saying here is honor the Lord with thy substance what's what does that mean substance means material possessions amen wealth or blessings received from God any blessings that is any blessing that is received from God is our substance amen including our time everything that uh that that it's under our control amen anything that's beyond our control that's different that's spiritual we cannot do anything but anything that is under our control right it's it it can be considered as substance first fruits symbolizes the very first and best portion of one's income or harvest first fruits so it means when we receive our salary for example we give tights immediately we don't need to wait right which is uh you can say that's the first fruits because uh we thank the Lord for for giving that or even because uh in the Old Testament titing is also about their uh what they harvest right uh they they tight on their on anything if you baram is saying if you have 10 apples the nine will be uh for for you and the 10th is for the Levites which is for the priests uh in in the Old Testament amen and uh it's the same for us right now which we don't we are mostly uh employed here so that's why we put tithes in the form of money amen and that's the the medium of exchange amen so that's uh that's the first fruits and it's an acknowledgement that all provision comes from the Lord when we Believers Place God first our Act of Faith and obedience opens the way for His blessings to overflow in our lives right acknowledging that that's why these are basic principles but very important ones that's why I'm uh I'm being slow with them I hope you're okay so that we can at least uh uh you know uh feed feed on it amen so when we give God the best he gives you the best in return I think you for those who are I I'm I'm trying to encourage everyone even the small kids uh or or the children that uh whatever you receive it's an increase that is an increase to you you should tight it and or or Pro give an offering although you might not uh uh be filing your taxes no problem but God will bless you abundantly and it's a start I know you're already doing it but it's an encouragement it starts from small and and when we think about it oh I have a $100 I will give 10 how about how about if you have 1,000 you will give 100 right how about if you have 100,000 you have 10,000 so it means it's relative it's 10% God is only asking 10 the government is asking 30 or even more amen amen aren't we thankful and uh yeah I hope you'll be with me and you'll not hate me after amen I'm just your brother here and putting the things to together and you know we are when we give God the best he gives us the best in return this aligns with Proverbs 39:10 as it reflects the concept of giving wants first and best which is the first fruits to God resulting in Divine favor and provision you see when when we give our tithes he will take care of the rest amen we don't need to worry at all amen we are stewards of what God has given us and the way we handle what he puts in our care shows our faith and reverence for him so so if if if we have faith of God in us and we want to follow his commandment then you know and we love him then we will obey his Commandments amen so what's the the application uh of worship in in in our daily lives material giving bar Branham uh of and encourage us amen Believers to tight and give offerings with a joyful heart amen trusting God to meet their needs amen and even the time and talents beyond beyond Financial giving we should offer our time it's a it's a valuable you can say commodity because time will pass but then we're if if we if we procrastinate you can say right in doing things so it means it's not only our money it's also our time so do we we have 24 hours in a day so that means 10% is 2.4 hours are we dedicating it to the Lord amen I'm guilty forgive me Lord amen two and half two two and a half hours a day that's what he needed from us right our time amen so God's blessing and multiplication right he brother Bram thought that uh God honors faithfulness by multiplying blessings in ways that go beyond material wealth open resulting in spiritual joy and satisfaction which symbolizes the new wine you can see the joy The Joy that's uh with this verse is uh burst out with new wine right wine represents the stimulation of Revelation so with new wine did you realize when something is revealed to you you're so happy oh not only happy you're so joyful that oh Lord why did you reveal this to me and I'm so thankful unto you we're blessed we we're feeding on the revealed word brothers and sisters so that's why that's so important amen so let's go with the the next one uh these are basic things that you might already know and we might have already preached before right so so the the the origin of uh tights titing and offer uffing a amen bear with me here my uh my notes okay so Genesis 14-20 and Genesis 4 4-5 you can see this is the these are the first scriptures where tights and offerings were mentioned in Genesis 14:20 and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tits of all this is the sto story of Abraham right giving or paying tits to melkisedek you you can read the Genesis 14 it's beautiful so titing it appears first in 14:20 and you can see Abraham P ties to melkisedek even before the law there's no law before that right because the law was given to Moses right for the law was given under Moses showing a precedent for honoring God with resources so you can see he gave he paid tights he gave him tights of all of all the spoils after the war after the the war with the with with the I forgot uh yeah anyway so after the war he gave all the the spoils amen so that's the first instance right uh of where tits was was mentioned amen how about offerings Genesis 44-5 and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his plaque and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his counter countenance fell so you can see the Lord gives us an example right in the lives of Cain and Abel in the area of bringing their offerings unto the Lord but uh even though uh both children brought offerings unto the Lord God had pleasure in Abel because it was done in the spirit of Revelation so you see yeah we're living in the revealed word that's why everything that we do it must align with the word revealed word for our day amen we don't feed on on the word of Noah or word of Moses although they might be applicable but they are shadows and types amen and for us we have the revealed world that's why we should know or or why we believe this way because it's a revealed thing to us we cannot force anyone to be a believer of this message but we're not Cults we believe this message which is Christ in us the hope of glory so we believe the Bible in its entirety the full word we don't follow a man we follow the god that is in that man amen amen so okay so it's a combination of teaching and preaching forgive me but but uh at least uh it's good that uh we can we can have solid foundation why we do what we do why we pay tights why we give offerings because it's the Commandment of the Lord amen tight means it's a tent of one's income dedicated to God Amen and it's derived from Strong's number Hebrews 46 43 age it's it's a Hebrew because it's in the Old Testament and when you see those strong numbers because the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and uh if it's in the New Testament they use G which is Greek right uh so it it is meser masar or M mahra it means 10th part or tight okay and offering it's a gift it's a gift given beyond the tight reflecting gratitude and love so it means it's beyond the titing so 10% is tight anything that you give beyond the tight it's called offerings whether it can be on missions but sometimes it's uh it's how you interpret because missions is apostil ship and it's F part of five-fold ministry that's why missions you can see go you're you're spreading the gospel that's why it can be part of uh of the tiing because uh you know it's for ministry right but then however it is it doesn't matter in the face of the CRA it's all donations but for us we follow the word of the Lord and the word of the Prophet that's why we we put them we set them aside amen so it is derived from the Strong's number AIDS 4503 which uh which is pronounced Mina and it's called the gift Tri tribute or offering amen so you can see uh those are the foundations amen so let's go start with the with some uh scriptures here about tithing and offerings so this first Foundation is everything belongs to God Amen Psalm 241 the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they means us that dwell therein so it means we all belong to the Lord so if we belong to the Lord anything that we own Belongs to the Lord amen the whole earth Belongs to the Lord and in Hagi 2:8 the silver is mine and the gold is mine said the Lord of H so everything belongs to God so let's not hold lightly or or hold tightly we should hold lightly because it doesn't belong to us anyway we're just stewards we have to distribute what we have been given to us amen we don't we we don't uh only feed on ourselves that's the reason why we have also Fellowship we want to be blessed that's why we you know we we invite people so that we can Feist on together right it's a sacrifice but who are you feeding it's the Lord in that bride in the Lord on that brother and sister that you're feeding that's why it's a blessing amen because everything belongs to God and the good thing also all things come from God you can see in this scripture 1 Chronicles 29 14 but who am I and what is my people this is David speaking that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sword for all things all things come of thee or come from thee and of thine own have we given thee so King David's recognition that everything given to God including your tithes offerings Mission comes from what he already owns amen he already owned it before and he's only asking for what he it is his and he's so gracious he only has 10% for tithes and whatever if you're a cheerful Giver then you can give more that will be considered offerings amen okay so this is a a very popular scripture but then also we have to think of it spiritually also because this verse can be a blessing but also a curse amen we're not trying to pull money or something this is the scripture it's not even ours right it's the Lord's Malachi 37-12 let we should not only reading 310 which is about titing but then even before that and after that so that we can really identify that it's important to follow God's word align ourselves in God's word and express it we just don't align and then that's it you walk no there is an action after it amen so let's read it amen even from the days of your fathers I don't know if you can read it hopefully you can amen ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you said the Lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return and then a question will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tights and offerings so it's so clear brothers and sisters tights and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation robbery theft that's one of the Ten Commandments right Thou shalt not steal so we're stealing from God if we don't pay our tithes and offerings amen let's continue but we are not like denominational Christians that only pull money that's why they're putting this ass against the Believers or or their congregation right but for us we're trying to put it in a scriptural way so that we will be taught that there is a foundation but once it's revealed to you you will see the benefits amen so we're so thankful amen so this is the popular scripture bring ye all the tights into the storehouse that there be that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now here with said the Lord of host if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it so blessing that's a blessing if you apply it you will you will benefit from it but don't just apply it because so that I'll be blessed it's just automatic the the main point there is you're obeying the Commandment of the Lord you believe the Commandment that's why you obey right it's not that uh oh I want to pay Tis so that I will be blessed no that's not it you love the Lord that's why you do it amen and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and she he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field said the Lord of hosts but the number 12 you see here and all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delightsome land said the Lord of hosts aren't we thankful brother and sisters if if we hold tightly then God will also hold tightly on His blessings unto us but we if we will hold lightly then the blessings Will Will just overflow it's so important brothers and sisters Amen to to to understand this I have a lot of quotes uh after this so these are questions that are we we we don't want to scare people but uh you know but we have a Vindicated Prophet that just opened our eyes of understanding and there was a question here does a Christian not get to heaven because they don't not they do not pay tith and what did he answer I could not say yes or no to that but I do believe that every Christian is obligated to pay TI thingss because it's a commandment of the lord we are born to follow or obey the Commandments of the Lord amen that they may have a right imagine to enter into the life the tree of life so it means when you're following the Commandment of the Lord you you have the right to enter because you're not withdraw uh withholding anything from him amen now I do believe that tight paying is essential to a Christian experience for I'll get to that in another question in a few moments I know there's another one pertaining to that he said let's continue but you know I feel like this that a member of a church their first obligation is with their tith and offerings first obligation brothers and sisters is to to support their Church if you are members of These Fine churches that's represented here you support your church that's your first duty to God bring your tithe and offerings into the storehouse and the storehouse this not my words I'm just quoting not parting parting means you don't understand but we understand it with Revelation amen and the storehouse you surely know what it that is is where you get your food yeah so there is where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is your church and not to an evangelist like me so it's brother Branham saying you don't pay the Evangelist here although he's paid us with love offering but we don't pay our tis there because it doesn't belong to him amen but it it will be uh he will be paid according to the tight uh donations that we have because it's part of the Ministry but we don't pay our tights to that evangelist or whoever that will come right but if if if you give him that's an an offering bar Bram is saying here tight belongs to the church and it's God's in in this assembly amen where where you're feeding where you're a member amen just you know and your obligation is to your church and not to an evangelist like me it's taken up somewhere along in the meetings when we have campaigns like this where you have a little laying aside to help support it that takes care of me he said so because he he was the one talking about it amen uh and he said I won't accept your tithes because you know I'm not your pastor right so something like that so and uh you put your tights in in in in in our bank here which is the Bank of Heaven Calgary Living Word assembly because because you belong to this church amen some more good stuff so I put the question there why did melis sedc receive tights imagine melis sedc let's read it I I it's so good what would a man take titing for he's talking about milk's deck if he had if he never was born and never will die and was from beginning to end and never had no father or mother or descent and own the whole heavens and earth and all in it why would he take tight amen it's a good question right it's just like why would God he everything he owns you know everything belongs to him why would he need our tithing why would he need our offering amen you can see why would he ask Abraham to pay tights you see what a strict thing it is to pay tights because it's a commandment right it's a strict thing titing is right every Christian is dy is Duty bound to pay tight that's right never has has been changed it's from the Old Testament and it's even in the New Testament that's why we practice it it's not because we follow other churches that are you know established before us but it's in the in in in the scripture now paragraph 124 as I may so say Levi also who received tight paid tights in Abraham I know I already preached a little bit of this but then let's go into detail about it amen now oh 125 here is something for he was yet in the loin of his father when melchisedek met him so it's Abraham who paid tis but it's accounted for Levi so let's read more because uh I want to encourage on what we do we're talking about the third and fourth generation that's the punch line there but then the thing is somebody Beyond us or I mean before us three or four generations praying and serving the lord and then we are are here now sitting in this church November 17th 2024 right and how about what we're doing in the next third and fourth generation amen so what Levi Abraham was Levi's great great grandpa and the Bible said here that Levi paid tis when he was in the Lo of Abraham four generations before he ever come to Earth he was paid K tights to melkisedek blessed be the name of the Lord then you that can't believe in predestination thank the lord it's so clear to us we're predestinated because we are elected amen or for ordination and here four generations before Levi would ever come out of the loins of Abraham was paying tights to madc wish we had time to run this through through the scripture brother Bram was saying verse 128 if you'd take it over to like in Jeremiah 1:4 Jeremiah 1:4 God said I knew you before you was even formed in your mother's womb he's talking about Jeremiah being a prophet same for br Branham the Lord knew him that he's a prophet even before the before the the world ever began and even us we're the Bride of Jesus Christ predestinated for ordained predestinated to be the bride because we accepted the full word not partial word amen not the word of any man but the word of the Lord amen through the Vindicated Prophet I knew you before you was even formed in your mother's womb and I Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations then what can you say that you did you cannot Merit the kingdom amen wherefore ordained it's by his election elective love because he knew that we will accept him even before the foundation of the world it's not our works of righteousness amen but by his grace alone what can I say that I did it's God that showeth mercy God knew us before the foundation of the world Amen predestination oh what an important concept amen of what we believe why we believe what we believe because it's already in the word and it's been revealed to us amen he not willingly that any should perish paragraph 129 certainly not but if is God he knew who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved or or he didn't know anything that's why we don't need to worry this is rest for us brothers and sisters we know we're trying to do God a service sometimes right especially when our children are not serving oh I will send you back to Philippines oh I will send you back to Africa right we've been talking so that you will you will be in line but what even in Philippines they have cellphones right even in Africa they have cell phon wherever you go right it's a rest for us amen that uh if God says uh said it in his word It's Already Done Deal we should just let go and let God Amen we cannot do anything amen uh to Merit it it's unmerited Grace that's why that's that's his his Mercy he be if he didn't know if he didn't know who would make the Rapture before the world was ever formed then he's not God right if he's infinite he knows every flee every fly every louse every that would ever be on the earth before the Earth was ever formed that's right he knew all things before the foundation of the world he knew us the Bible said that he knew us and predestinated US does God know you this morning amen do you know God Amen we we're thankful on on this uh uh when we have the chance to to feed on this word amen so talking about the iniquity because once you do the Commandments of the Lord is a blessing but once you don't do it it's also a curse so that's why he's a fair God you know God's nature is also a just God Amen he but for us being the bride we are already being judged right now because we will sit in the white Throne judgment judging the whole thing amen and we will be sitting in his throne right so we're blessed that's why when when you accept the message of the hour which is the the message for this day you you you're already being judged according to the word of God being the bride we are special class of people we we we know there are other people there that will that will be in heaven that will be saved because salvation is a big thing but Redemption is a little bit different because we belong to God that's why we're redeemed and transformation is also different right and and translation is also different because the bride will be the only one that will be raptured for for this day amen for our for our age amen the bride age it's only the bride those who will not make it they will suffer tribulation like the foolish virgins bar branam is saying but they will die according to their works and their their sacrifice and uh they will accept later on Jesus Christ during the tribulation but for us we're already gone we are already in glory with the Lord amen we we're having our three and a half years of uh of uh uh uh married supper amen we're thankful unto the Lord numbers 14:1 17-21 and now so we have time 15 minutes don't worry BR Joel you'll have time yeah amen and now I beit thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou has spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering and of great Mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation this is kind of hard because in the Old Testament if you are a bastard child you cannot even enter the the congregation even to 10 Generations I believe but uh with this is three and fourth generation pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now but this is the the good stuff on verse 20 and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy word praise the Lord but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord as are we not thankful brothers and sisters we are condemned by representation one man Adam of course with Eve right because Eve is part of Adam he was we we are condemned but one by one man also the blood of Jesus Christ amen the Lord that's why it's so important to understand that amen we are pardoned according to Thy word amen oh another one listen just to encourage you God is not concerned so much about your money but even before that just to finish about the third and fourth generation what we do today Brothers and sisters there will be beneficiary in the future we are beneficiaries of what our ancestors did for us we might not know maybe you can ask DNA test and whatever or or your ancestry.com whatever then you will find that somewhere before us we're praying and doing the will of the Lord and they're praying that their Generations or or their their future uh uh descendants will also be Christians amen and for us what we do today will also benefit our grand children Grand grandchildren and great great great grandchildren so it will be a continuous cycle it's it's like paying it forward what we receive now we're so blessed brothers and sisters beyond measure where where can you find good people like this only in the church right beautiful people that really loves the Lord and why would you not like or love this kind of uh life you don't drink you don't smoke you don't defile your body in any way although we're working progress everyone is but don't you want this kind of life when you are asked who would not want this right we're so blessed beyond measure oh brothers and sisters if if we if we can just make an inventory of what God has done to us that's why we BR brandom is saying whatever he he receives he he he give tis to the church he paid tight to the church but then he's not satisfied he wanted to give 90 to the church and then take only 10 but the the government didn't allow him right but then the thing is look at that as an example to us right prove me we read the scripture prove me if I will not open the windows of Heaven for the blessings that you cannot contain if we are so uh faithful in doing that we know we have a lot of uh good people here amen that does that that's why we're blessed amen I'll include myself amen I'm I'm thankful that God blessed me abundantly Beyond even measure or Beyond even reasoning that God just who who would be who who would think that I will be here in Calgary I didn't even know that there's a place called Calgary in my life when I was in Philippines I know know that there's Canada but I didn't know that there's a beautiful place like Calgary but God put us here amen and we're so thankful amen so think of that brothers and sisters what you're doing today it might not benefit you right away but how about your future Generations your descendants your child your grandchild and so on if the Lord ties right then then then we will see it amen but uh maybe based on the condition of time there might not be a lot of time but then the thing is it's still a balance we cannot spir spiritualize everything that's why we have a session uh this afternoon right we we think of spiritual here but then we're also humans so how can we give if we don't have anything to give right so it's good to invest but think of the good Investments amen bar Branham already put there I think five Services he he put on investments just a Prelude spiritually but later on you will feed natur right spiritual we cannot spiritualize everything right but we need to be careful also Investments because uh investment means something that will grow okay it's not an overnight scheme that you will be rich overnight amen bar Bram is saying if you think that company will grow then invest in it put your faith in it right so you know but but we know money and even other currencies they will all disappear later on that's the reason why BR Branham is saying it will go back to Gold Standard right because all these things are manipulated Fiat money doesn't have any value you're only relying on what on the government that okay I will do you good because it will be taken from the people anyway how will we pay it through our taxes anyway that's why it's negotiable right when you have the money Canadian dollar when you put it they will you know exchange it with goods and services right because but you're it's not backed up by gold it's backed up by trust or a decree right by by the government saying oh this has a value of $100 but actually it doesn't mean anything because before it's on the gold standard but you cannot bring a one kilogram of gold that is worth let's say $2,500 right now because if you buy $1 how could you cut the gold right so they put it simply to make it uh in a paper right so I'll call the musicians as I as I as I close but what I'm saying is Investments they are important amen but bar Branham also mentioned to us that invest in things that are Eternal when when when you invest in in in things that will grow physically you have the ability now to help the kingdom how by missions by your tithes by offerings right so there is a balance in everything you cannot Spirit spiritualize everything even anything that we do here in the church you cannot spiritualize everything there's always a natural and there's always spiritual so we have to balance ourselves so that we'll not be thinking that oh oh God will come tomorrow anyway so I will not work right people already took that so hoing potatoes if you know that God is coming tomorrow right you should still do it amen and that's balance in our in the in in the message that we receive we don't take a coat and then run away with it I've heard so many people Revelations 3 1 to three is for the church and he will come back on the 19th Revelation 19 right because the church is is done so they forget Revelations 4 to8 amen but he preached Revelation 6 the seals it's about the bride Revelations 10:7 it's about the prophet Mal so we we cannot get one one coat only and then rely or or or bet your your life on it you you should think of what the prophet is saying as a whole because the message is different before the message of the hour is on the table right now it's on your cell phone the older preachers they have books they will come with the you know lots of books when they preach we understand that because there's no nothing electronic before but now being the bride you can tell whether the preacher is saying the truth or not so you cannot teach the bride anymore but we need to be teachable what I'm saying is you cannot just think of your own denominational thinking and preach that that's correct because it is written in English especially with North America they understand English better than anyone so how could you teach the language right it's by Revelation so what I'm saying is the message is already it's in entirety right we don't put one coat and then run away with it and forget the other Coates right that's why everybody's thinking oh the seals are not open how how can you feed on a book that is not open and it's even in the scripture right so it's a it's a warning to us but not even a warning right it's a it's a reminder to us that uh we need to study the Bible and check what BR Branham said yeah we were we were fellowshipping with Barberry when I when I accepted the message we almost accepted the message same time 2005 or six I was in Qatar and by the way they have their 50th year anniversary in uh in uh in that church in in Philippines that's now the pastor is uh sister Carmen's son son but the previous Pastor was the one who baptized me and my wife so they started 50 years ago I didn't even know that they're 50 years I'm golden also I'm 50 years old so I will remember that I'm so thankful that because of that small Church in 1974 accepted the message and it just imagine I accepted the message in a Muslim country witness which is a product of that church that witnessed to me and everything is history I'm so thankful that's what you call predestination for ordination from God we're so thankful brothers and sisters you see it's a different generation 1974 that's the first generation maybe we're second or third but with that what we are part of it and you know it's important that whatever we give through missions like that you can say that uh they work in Qatar it's a Muslim country but they don't live there basically they they they work there for to make a living to support their family in the Philippines but there's a small Church there and that's where I I I knew the message I'm so thankful and then I I saw in the in in online that uh there're celebrating the 50th anniversary I'm so thankful brother Dano Bernardo was the one who baptized me and and and and my wife and and the son was the one witnessed to me for a year you know removing all the the impurities in me or you can say the the denominational thinking in me being a Catholic and uh being a an Evangelical that got baptized two times so when I was told you know acts 238 and then showing all the scriptures do you need to be baptized again the third time you will be you must be Gible so you have to prove brothers and sisters what I'm saying is what we have been given we need to be ready you know to be stewards right we're just stewards we manage what we are given amen it's not only for us the reason why he gave us more is because he knows that we know how to manage it so last the last uh slide and then we can sing are you happy this morning brothers and sisters I I I have a lot here

wonderful to have some instruction according to the word I just it just just does something to me when I think about the power of tithing I know the Lord revealed it to me in such a powerful way and I trust that he would do that for each and every one of us that it's not a an exclusive thing it's not a a private interpretation it's not a a mystery it's a revelation and when that Revelation truly strikes it is one of the most powerful Revelations I think there is but you know I think even more I just can't get past the thought about how important it is to invest in the greatest thing outside of our salvation and that is our family our spouses our ability to actually impart blessings upon third and fourth Generations from us what is the responsibility that lies on us it's incredible lies in US my or or the cursings that we can bring upon our children our children's children and their children why it's pretty powerful certainly thankful to have brother Willie vanderly here with us from
