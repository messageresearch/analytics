[Music] things [Applause] [Music] coming [Music] bless you tonight welcome to the house of the Lord just have a few prayer requests as many know has graduated this week on Monday the Lord saw fit to take her home [Music] we're certainly thankful for that and you know every time I I think about a graduation about someone passing away it's sad on this side but when you see me cry I Don't Cry tears of Sorrow because I know that we'll meet again I Cry tears because I know there's a land [Music] and I long to be there yes it's like everyone we have loved ones there no that's a promise we have a few more days to labor here and every day that we have here every time we see someone graduate we see some pass on and just creates a desire in the heart of every believer I believe to keep pressing on you just want to remember Sister Tina's family [Music] they would come to know the Lord Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection the way our dear sister did and we know that would be her desire as well she wouldn't want to see us Sorrowing she wouldn't want to see us wallowing she would want to see us rejoicing she would want to see us pressing on she would want to hear our worship she would want to know that we all have the Holy Ghost and that we know that when our time comes for the Lord to call us home that we would be ready that's what she would want to know and maybe I'm crazy for talking this way but I believe she was a Believer and I believe that Believers have the same desire and that is to have the Seal of the Holy Ghost in their lives because that's all we have brothers and sisters there's nothing else in this world that will endure there's nothing else that we can take with us except for his character we don't want to take our character our character will not take us where we want to go [Music] my let's remember sister Tina and her family sister Tina's family we don't need to remember her in prayer we need to Rejoice for her because she's not mourning right now we have another request for Deanna Turner it's brother Paul and sister Elaine's business associate she was diagnosed with ALS this week as we understand we just want to remember her I'd like to remember my stepmother Beverly Johnson who took a fell today fall today she was in Edmonton and slipped and she's partially blind and suffering with a physical Affliction for quite some time and now she has a broken arm as I understand and we're waiting to hear the rest of the doctor's report so we'll just remember her and anyone else who has a need tonight to speak and no one with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord one more time that we can gather together Sons and Daughters of the most high God Heavenly Father we thank you that you have called each one of us unto adoption Lord you haven't called us to be church members you haven't called us to just be associate friends and family but Lord Jesus you've called us to the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and father we're so thankful that you've given us the direct Pathway to Christ Jesus Lord that we can truly receive the baptism of the holy spirit in our day Lord Jesus knowing it's not a sensation it's not an act lord it's not just a sign or a Wonder but it's the person of Jesus Christ Living out through our lives father every day saying Amen to the word Lord we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to us Lord each one of us has a testimony how you've moved in our lives Lord Jesus and that's why we are here tonight that's why we're standing together father because you called us here Lord and father we just desire to give you the praise sincerely from our hearts Lord Jesus father we just want to remember the requests that were made known unto you tonight father Lord Jesus sister Tina's family we we thank you Lord for our dear sister's life and her testimony Lord father that she would have the Holy Spirit in her life that she would have the Holy Ghost that her desire was to be in church whenever she could be in church Lord we have testimony on testimony from her in her handwriting Lord Jesus her words Lord about how you've moved in her life and father we cherish those because we know that was from the heart of a True Believer and Lord we pray that those testimonies would be more than just the ink on paper father to the children of God tonight that they would be Lord Jesus a witness of your life and our sister Lord father we love you and we thank you we thank you for our sister Lord thank you for her ability to believe Lord we thank you for her family tonight Lord we pray that you would just Lord Comfort them tonight father oh and Lord as we mentioned we pray that they would be able to come to know you and the power of your Resurrection the way that our sister did Father Lord we love you and we thank you we just ask all those things in the name of Jesus Christ Lord tonight we just want to remember Deanna Turner Lord according to brother Paul and sister Elaine father they've asked her if if she would mind if they brought her name before the church and Lord before the church could bring her name before your throne Lord Jesus and she was agreement to that Lord and so tonight we just come together in the as a body of Believers in Calgary and we just stand together United with this prayer request father that you would touch her in the name of Jesus Christ and father once again Lord maybe not that she would be changed in her body but Lord we're not looking for signs and wonders what we're looking for is the ability to believe your word Lord Jesus and father perhaps she could through this testimony come to know you in the power of your Resurrection in her life Lord Jesus that's the the goal in this age Lord Jesus is to see Soul saved father oh Lord we know that all the signs follow but Lord let us get the ABCs right father we just asked would allow her to see the witness of your life through Paul and Elaine Clawson Lord and that she would desire to know their Godfather Lord we love you and we thank you we just commit that request into your hand we just want to remember Beverly Claussen tonight Lord that you would just touch her Lord that supernaturally Lord she would see you living out through her life father we know that she has never prayed like she prays today father that she has never believed like she believes today Father and we just pray that you would continue to move in her life Lord that she would be an encouragement to the family around her Lord and we'll be careful to give you all the praise father Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you we just commit all these requests into your hands tonight father we just want to ask that you would Lord remember all those who are traveling from our midst father that you would keep your hand upon them Lord Jesus father we thank you for keeping your hand upon sister Rebecca Lord that she would return safely father thank you for your goodness to us Lord we pray that you would just Lord be pleased with all that said and done in our services we go forwards as we commit all these requests into your hands Lord we know that you have it under control we thank you for that promise Lord tonight we just Lord give you this service that it would be for your glory Lord that you would come by our way and speak to us as we walk with you one more time father we love you and we thank you for your goodness and we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Hallelujah God bless you everyone thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to turn to Ephesians chapter 5. seem like I'm going backwards a little bit but I don't think there's one part of scripture that is old you know that all scripture is given for inspiration let's start with verse 21. I believe it's the fundamental part of this discussion that we'll get into tonight verse 21 it says submitting yourselves out of Ephesians chapter five sorry Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God if we can't do that then the rest of it is irrelevant verse 22 says why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord where the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as Christ also love the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might represent might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband chapter six children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth this bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word amen thank you Lord Jesus that we can read the word that we can turn back the pages and read the black and white and red print on the page father but Lord more than that we thank you that we can take and allow your Holy Spirit father to Quicken this word to our very Souls Lord Jesus because many people read this word and they read it and they close it and they say that was a good word but father by your Holy Spirit we know that you Quicken this word to us and father it's more than life to us Lord it changes us every single time we read it father every single time we speak it Lord every single time we think it Lord Jesus it does something to us and father we just ask that we could commit this word spoken tonight into your hands father that you would receive all the praise and all the glory as we go forwards we just Commit This service now into your hands Lord Jesus Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just like to welcome all of our visitors with us trust you feel right at home certainly wonderful to have visitors people that want to fellowship with the Believers different cities and towns pleasure to have you with us be happy tonight certainly thankful for the testimony of sister Tina and we were able to go and see her on Monday I think just about an hour or so before she went home and it was wonderful to see her she recognized me and we were able to have a word of prayer and it's just amazing to see when somebody actually gets called home I wasn't there with her when she did go but I do believe Sister Janet was there Mr Janet was able to see a daughter of God slip from one dimension into another to take the last breath here on this side but see that she would just be taking that very first gulp of the cleanest purest air that there ever has been created to slip over into that other dimension what a tremendous time certainly thankful for our dear sisters testimony I believe there will be a funeral and we'll have announcement when we get details I I don't know any more than that at this moment so as soon as I find out we'll definitely pass it along to everyone uh this weekend we'll be traveling to Edmonton brother Gilbert has agreed to take the service on the Sunday it's brother Gilbert here tonight he's not here tonight yeah he uh definitely is inspired for Sunday though so just pray for him and pray for the services in Edmonton and I'm sure it'll be a wonderful time we'll be back again for Wednesday next week tonight um I believe this will become a bit of a tradition but I just think it's real important for us as Believers many times we can get so caught up in our lives and and the things that we have going on our dreams and our families and our careers and our education and all these things and we all have these things to do we have to do these things we've got to hold our potatoes we have to make sure that we're making Provisions but we need to remember why we're doing it and the reason why we're doing it is because we're Sons and Daughters of God and we will he will bless us but the way he blesses us is for us to seek Him First to remember that there's something greater than all of this stuff that we see here on Earth so tonight I just want to take a moment and I want to read from paragraph 38 of beyond the curtain of time is because we know that there's a place this is not a fictitious thing it's not just a pipe dream you know people might say well that's just your opinion and you know it is but we heard something interesting about when our sister Tina passed away and I think it's important to actually have these discussions the nurses there said that this was such a peaceful passing it was the most peaceful passing they have ever witnessed and these are people that see this all the time and why is that is because she knew where she was going she knew her position she had no fear she knew that it was going to get a whole lot better and you know brothers and sisters just my opinion my view but I believe that's why she didn't want the surgery do you want to fight this battle anymore she didn't want to walk around with a backpack for the rest of her life she said either God's Gonna heal me or he's going to take me home and there's nothing wrong with that but there's also nothing wrong with someone taking the doctor's prescription either and and what they have for them to do and I wouldn't say one way or the other it's got to be our own revelation but as a Believer what a testimony their final testimony from the nurse other people get really upset and they get really scared when they're going to pass away and their bodies start to freak out and they don't even know why and the nurses even said that I've heard it before from nurses as well people they get really anxious and upset even when they're not even conscious and why is that it's because they don't know where they're going to go they're afraid and you know we have every reason to be afraid as human beings if we don't have the token of the holy spirit in our lives but anyways tonight I just want to read this here quick before we get into the service it says then a voice spoke to me is that what I want to be no it's not um I'll just read it here the other morning I was lying on my bed I had just woke from sleep and I placed my hands behind my head and relaxed with my head on the pillow then I began to wonder what it would be like on the other side you ever wonder that what will it be like on the other side and I wonder right now tonight what teen sister Tina's thinking what what's she saying what she's doing how many hands has she shaked how many people has she hugged I realized that I have lived more than half my life if I live to be as old as my people and I wanted to do more for the Lord before I left this life I Heard a Voice saying you're just starting press the battle keep pressing as I lay there pondering the words I thought that I just imagined that I had heard a voice again the voice said press the battle keep going keep going still unbelieving I thought that possibly I had spoken the words myself I placed my lips between my teeth and held my hand over my mouth and listen The Voice spoke again just keep pressing if you only knew what was the at the end of the road I seem to hear the music and words of an old familiar song I'm homesick in blue I want to see Jesus I would like to hear those Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and banish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time then the voice asked would you like to see beyond the curtain I answered it would help me so much what happened I cannot say whether I was in the body or else whether I was whether it was a translation I do not know and remember we identified this in scripture this is something that's not outside of the word just for those who maybe are wondering Paul had this happen he had it happen to him it was a translation I do not know but it was unlike any Vision I'd ever had I could see the place to which I was taken and I could see myself lying back there upon my bed I said this is a strange thing there were great numbers of people and they came running to greet me crying oh our precious brother first came young women apparently in the early 20s and as they would embrace me they said our precious brother young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood with eyes glistening like stars on a darkened night with teeth white as pearls embraced me saying our precious brother then I noticed that I too had become young again I looked at myself and and turned and looked back at my old body lying on the bed with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this as I begin to try to comprehend the place where I was I began to realize that there was no yesterday and no tomorrow there no one seemed to get tired as a multitude of the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen through their arms around me I discovered there was only a great love that overwhelmed me and no physical attraction as in human behavior I noticed these young women all wore their hair down to their waistline and their skirts went down to their feet after this my first wife after this hope my first wife hugged me and said my precious brother then another young woman hugged me hugged me and hope turned and hugged The Other Woman I said I don't understand this this is something entirely different from our human love I don't want to go back to that old body on that bed now I'll pick up from where I had in my notes same word though then a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here amen without it and I want to say tonight brothers and sisters if we got perfect love have we got that in our lives next I was taken up and seated on a high place all around me were great numbers of men and women in the bloom of Youth they were crying with joy oh our precious brother we are so happy to see you here I thought I'm not dreaming for I can see these people and I can see my body laying back there on the bed then the voice spoke to me you know what's written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people I said yes I remember that in the scriptures but there are not this many branhams The Voice replied these are not branhams these are your converts the ones you have led to the Lord amen I'll just throw this in there I believe sister Tina's in that group I believe that we all were there in that group this was an eternal Place brothers and sisters this isn't something that's just going to happen collectively throughout time and maybe sometime if we're lucky we'll find ourselves there we were there amen said no wonder they are crying out my precious brother then the multitude cried together if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here I I asked oh where's Jesus I want to see him the people replied he's just a little higher someday he will come for you you were sent as a leader and when God comes he will judge you according to your teaching I asked does Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also answer was yes I said I have preached what they preached I did not divert from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus I did too where they taught the baptism in the Holy Spirit I did too whatever they taught I taught also we know that the people cried and we know that we're going back to Earth with you sometime Jesus will come and judge you according to the word you preached us then you will present us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth and live forever I asked you I have to go back to Earth now they answered yes but keep pressing on as I began to move from that beautiful joyful place as far as my eyes could see people were coming towards me to embrace me crying my precious brother suddenly I was back on my bed again I said oh God help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word I don't care what anyone else does and I believe brothers and sisters if I could say something tonight I want to underline that I want to bold that I want to italicize that I want to shout that doesn't matter what anybody else does stay straight on the word I don't care what anyone else does Lord let me press on to that beautiful joyful place I want to say this too because if we do deviate from the word we're not pressing on towards that place brothers and sisters a little tiny bit off right here could actually be a long ways off over there I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place amen amen perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are on you these things do not matter get perfect love if you're not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now yes if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins be baptized now if you have not received the baptism in the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time let's keep pressing on brothers and sisters we have the ability to do that and I believe that's why we're here tonight because we want to keep pressing on we might not see it all we might not understand it all but there's something inside of us that just desires to keep pressing on because we believe this this is more than just words and print this is more than just something that we listen to this is this is the word of life for our age I was thinking about this you know just contemplating it and how we have faith and perfect love is is perfect Faith isn't it and we can't have perfect love until we get perfect faith we have got to have perfect faith in the word perfect faith in the word for our day is going to bring us perfect love because perfect love brothers and sisters isn't something we can just run down to the store and buy we can run down and get a bag of whatever it is that we want to buy but we can't go to a store anywhere and say I want to get a couple pounds of perfect love or a couple tons of perfect love it's impossible we can't go and by faith that way how do we get this then how do we get to the place where we've got perfect love again I got the question but I believe there's a scriptural answer for it and you know what we need to get Faith and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of the Lord and you know how do we do that we go to church we listen to the message of the hour we pray we Fellowship one to another but you know if we're not willing to do any of that if we're not willing to go to church if we're not willing to actually humble ourselves to the word of God we're not going to be able to hear it and you know just like we've heard many times over there's a time where people had the opportunity to hear the the sound of Jubilee the trumpet of Jubilee and what is that trumpet of Jubilee it means complete Liberty it doesn't matter what kind of a slave or whatever bondage you've been under anything you could have done you could have been a murderer you could have been any kind of slave or or bonds person but when that trumpet of Jubilee sounded you got to go free you got to go back to all that was yours Once Upon a Time and isn't that wonderful doesn't matter what you had gone through where you found yourself what what Pig Pen you found yourself in you could go free and we we know brother Adam says it they would throw down their rakes and their shovels and say I'm out of here I don't have to be under a slave Taskmaster anymore I get to go free I got to go home I get to go see my family brothers and sisters as Sons and Daughters of God we can hear the sound of of that Jubilee trumpet through the voice of a Vindicated Prophet what that is is our Jubilee spiritually speaking it gives us the ability to get the baptism of the Holy Spirit the true baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot of anointing of the holy spirit in this world there's a lot of people that are claiming Jesus Christ lots of people claiming the blood who am I but is he Lord you know verse 21 I think says it all we've got to be willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and when we can't do that there's something wrong but when we can do it I think that is the beginning that's the gateway to seeing all of this Ephesians come to pass uh is it seeing it open up the power of the scripture we've heard testimonies little tiny things but you know these little tiny things are really big things we can hear people say that you know I had this desire to do something on my own as a wife and and I knew my husband didn't want me to do it that way but what I did was I said it's not the way that I want to do it but I'm just going to say honey what do you want to do just give it to the husband and that'd be the husband's deal and husband makes a decision and the husband says wow for you to do that I I don't want to do what I want to do I want to do what you want to do because you're willing to submit to me it changes everything brothers and sisters but that's why I say verse 21 applies 21 supersedes all of it if we can't submit ourselves one to another then there's no point in a husband saying you got to submit to me and and to the wife and the wife serving her husband it's not going to happen there comes a point in time where we have to be able to have faith in this scripture what I'm saying is when we have a faith even a teeny little bit of faith in this scripture and we're willing to let go of our past Notions and our past teachings our past traditions and say I'm just going to allow the Lord if this is real lord then just make this real to me in my life don't don't care what anybody else says like brother Branham said I'm not gonna let anybody allow me to get off the word I'm going to stay straight on that word that's what I want to do and when God hears us say that in our lives I don't understand it how can I actually submit myself to my husband I've been taught to be a strong woman and stand on my own how could I do that I guarantee you God will pour out a blessing upon you sister God will show you that this is exactly right and when he does what happens is it causes a little bit of Faith to grow it causes a little bit of confidence in this word and the more that you get confidence the more that you'll apply the word and the more you apply the more you get that's the way God works but if we try and do it our own way mix our own thoughts our own thinking with it you know what I don't have to believe it I don't believe that God said a prophet when we start going down that road it changes it because he was straight on the word but when we can say I don't understand it I don't get it I don't completely comprehend all this business of the message of the hour but you know what if you just try a little bit if you taste a little bit if you just give a little bit just say God show me a little bit just open my eyes a little bit he'll show you it's not just for wives it's not just for husbands it's not just for children you know we come to a place where we have to lay down our own faith First Peter 1 8 says whom having not seen ye love we love him but we don't see him in whom now ye see him not yet we believe we believe him now oh it says you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory when we get together in a service it's not just something that we do to see each other we want to see each other we don't want to come to church and not see anyone kovid was terrible we'd come to the building and there'd be five people but when we can get together like this we can sing with joy unspeakable and full of Glory because we recognize what he's done for us and what he's done for us has showed us the end of our faith it's not our faith we can't have perfect love with our faith it's got to be his faith and when it's his faith then it becomes perfect receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls and this this brothers and sisters this just gets me of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you how is that Grace going to come unto you how is that Grace going to come unto me it's going to come through the voice of a Vindicated prophet God speaking to man saying just stay straight on the word and then you can press on to that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you know I just started thinking about it in our positions brothers and sisters how how the husband he's got away every single time and the wife she's got away every single time it's the way it is it's different halves of the person right different parts of the person we know the Adam when he was created in the image of God God said in the mayor in in the image of God created he they male and female he created them as one they were one Spirit together and then he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and man still had woman in him and God performed the first operation and pulled that rib out and created woman from him God didn't actually just speak her into existence she was a part of him she came from Adam and when we have a husband and wife we have two halves of the whole but there's actually three that need to be a part of it those two come together and they have their their ways and what I want to get to tonight brothers and sisters is understanding when we have a husband and he's got certain ways as a wife we want to honor those ways even when oh my this is where it gets tough even when they're a little bit shaky and maybe a little bit off the word what does brother Bradham say in the message of the hour he says when your husband starts to get a little bit rough the woman asks them the question he says just bake him a pie oh my when the husband starts to get a little bit Gruff and he's not really nice and there's problems in the home what what is a what should a wife do just bake him a pie show them love Express that perfect love show that you're a daughter of God but the same thing goes the other way it's not just for the wife to completely submit to the to the husband the husband needs to submit to the wife because it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God because it's all about God here it's not about my wife oh my she's she's she's a byproduct of me and I can just treat her like a doormat she's supposed to do the laundry and the dishes and have my food ready for me Brothers if that's what we're doing we got it all wrong she's your queen if anything we should be helping her I say Lord help me but we all have our ways where I'm going with this there's a purpose for it children our parents like things a certain way our parents come to the place where we expect the children to hang up their coats to put their shoes away to bring their backpacks in after school and empty their lunch containers to do things to contribute maybe put their laundry away put it put it downstairs where that needs to be washed bring it back upstairs when it's all clean whatever parents have their ways we all want to understand what one another likes don't we because when we understand that it creates Harmony in the home and if we don't have that mindset I want to encourage us find out what your parents like children husbands find out what your wives like you shouldn't be married if you don't know what your wife likes same thing to the wife and a husband but sometimes you know we get busy in life things happen we get burdened down with the cares of life and maybe we can just get a little bit cloudy we can get a little bit forgetful and and maybe just stuck in our own ways and worried about our own problems and forget about what what it is our wife likes what our husband likes maybe what our parents like tonight I want to take it and go further I don't want to stay there I want to say what does the Holy Spirit like brothers and sisters what does our husband like because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ if we can recognize what he likes oh my then we'll have that testimony too if we're like sister Tina and we say hey I'm not going to take what the doctor says I'm going to take what the great physician says and he's going to do it his way whether he takes me by the grave or he takes me by the sky it's going to be his way out of 1955. the power of the devil brother Branham says there's something trying to work in every individual heart here tonight saying that's the truth but does it mean me he says yes it means whosoever will let him come it means you the Holy Ghost is here to save every sinner to call back every backslider to heal every sick person that's the attributes of death of the death of Jesus Christ and he's here to make manifest I just want to say this just for the record some people would say he's here to heal the sick is he but sister Tina was sick and she passed away didn't she so where's our faith so where's her faith so where's the problem there's got to be an issue or or a situation remember nothing happens by accident God doesn't call someone home by accident there's no oh I didn't realize that that brother or that sister was gonna die today oh we need to do something in heaven here and make things right nothing happens unless God first says that's going to happen and if it's not that way he's not God nobody passes away from this Dimension and goes to that Dimension unless God first says it's time he's here tonight to make manifest night after night you see him hour after hour you see him working and right now while I'm trying to keep away from that anointing of the Blessed Holy Spirit which the angel of God who's the infallible person in our midst tonight I'm having a time can you imagine this he's saying this I'm having a time because Visions are jumping all over the building at this time and trying to keep it down so I can have this prayer line I'm not a liar and neither am I a hypocrite I'm telling you the truth that's right because why the Holy Spirit likes for you to have faith the Holy Spirit likes for you to have faith so I want to say this if that's what the Holy Spirit likes the Holy Spirit doesn't like it when we start to speak negative the Holy Spirit doesn't like it when we hang out with negative the Holy Spirit doesn't like negative brothers and sisters the Holy Spirit likes faith the Holy Spirit likes for you to have faith and the Holy Spirit lives on the word that's the reason it gets so big in you it stretches out when you receive the word of God man it is written man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and when you put the Holy Ghost in you go to drinking in the word you begin to rise up in faith Hallelujah I just think it's so beautiful when we talk about this Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 29 the husband's desire is to know know what his wife likes the husband's desire is to know his position and and the wife's desire Ephesians 5 22-24 is to know what what her husband likes is to know how to please her husband it's not just for the wife to be pleasing her husband and making everything ready for her husband the husband is the king sure he is but he's also the servant because if he's truly the king like the King of Kings then he's willing to lay down his life just like Christ was willing to lay down his life for the church so I would say in my view that there ain't nothing above the husband in the home doing nothing now could get awfully quiet there clean a toilet yeah do some laundry sure wash some dishes why not would it please your wife who doesn't want their wife pleased who doesn't want to see a happy wife she's not the servant if we're doing that Brothers we've got to stop doing that it's true just like the wife has to say you know what I need to surrender to my husband's will even if I don't agree with it I need to because I know that's where the blessing of God is I know that's what his word says when we're doing that brothers and sisters we're just saying okay God I'm going to take you with your word I'm going to apply it the way you say to do it and it's up to you to bring the results it's not up to me to bring the results we talked about it on Sunday it's up to God to prove his word not us and when we try to do it we make a mess of it but the wives truly desire children desire to know what pleases their parents because we know that that's what the scripture says in Ephesians chapter 6 in Ephesians chapter 6 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and the mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee that thou mayest live long on the earth that everything will be fine just honor your father and your mother maybe I don't understand it maybe I don't like it maybe it bugs me but you know what if it does God knows it and as children just ask God to come on the scene just as much as you could ask God as a husband or you could ask God as a wife as a child you could change parents Hearts if something isn't right in your home and I want to say probably even more so when he hears the sincere prayer from the heart of a child how much more will he move I I just think he'll want to move a lot we know the disciples said no keep them away they're kids they they might get my clothes dirty they might get your clothes dirty Master they're dirty maybe they have snotty noses maybe I shouldn't say that from the pulpit but their children keep them away they might get you sick and what did he say no suffer the little children to come unto me because unless you're willing to come as one of these you won't even see the kingdom of heaven I just think how much could a child move the heart of the Lord how much could he move in a home of a family my I just want to read a few quotes tonight about how the Holy Spirit likes it the Holy Spirit likes things our husband he likes things brothers and sisters this great warrior David 1955 if you wanna bring it up it's zero one one eight this great warrior David I love how the prophet brother Branham he expresses things here it's important for us to to recognize it I I heard it said when we were in Saskatoon that you know if we don't preach faith it's just going to lay dormant in the church it's there the faith is there in the hearts of people but people need encouragement people need to see the power of God move in their lives and that's why I said tonight if you want to see this Ephesians come to life if you want to see God move try applying these scriptures and say Lord I don't understand it my husband will never ever ever change he has never changed he's always been the same way I just don't get it but I'm just going to give it to you and see if you'll move on the scene Lord watch him move on the scene when you do it with a sincere heart paragraph 49 of this great warrior David how about the thousands across the country today some of you sitting here I get your letters where you were blind and bedridden when I was here the last time you walked in with the sword of faith and chopped off the head of that Goliath you're holding up tonight for a testimony made me think how many of us can hold up that head of the Giant Goliath in our lives that we chopped off by faith in our lives every single one of us have testimonies and I think it's important for us to do that and maybe this will be the change of my narrative when we have these testimony Services it's not just a testimony when we see the Lord really do something for us in our lives it's because we've seen a devil destroyed and you know brothers and sisters I think it's really important to understand well we're talking about testimony Services we're talking about God moving in our lives we're talking about the real deal testimony of the Holy Spirit helping us in our lives we can say that he helped us get a a great discount deal on something that we were shopping for and that's fine and good but what about our Eternal salvation how is God making this word real to us in our lives that's the testimonies that he's looking to hear unbelievers can go out and get good deals you see he ain't interested in hearing that and that's not going to increase the faith in the hearts of the children but when we hear about how we had this tremendous problem that we just didn't know how to solve in our life we had a doctor's diagnosis that said there was going to be a certain way and we said I don't know I don't understand it I can't believe it I don't want to accept it but it scares me Lord I don't know what to do I'm your child and you know what I honored my father and I honored my mother I take you at your word and now I give it back to you you said that I would live long days on this Earth if I'm willing to honor you if we can take it to the Lord and say it that way you know what we're going to have a testimony there will be a Goliath in our lives whose head we will chop off and then when he comes around again with something else we're going to hold up that head and say no see that it's gory it's gross but hey it's not attached to his body anymore it was God it wasn't me it says when I was here the last time you walked in with the sword of faith and chopped off the head of that Goliath you're holding up for a testimony tonight what did the rest of the army see that's why we have the testimony Services that's why God wants to show his power in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ what does the rest of the army see it's beautiful when they seen it could be done they said we can do it too for we are Israelites also and your every one God's children and got a right to the blessing what does the prophet say here what does God say through the prophet pull the sword now let's go forth and slay these goliaths out of here who wants a Goliath in your life anyway who wants to drag around a devil who wants to make a provision for a devil and say oh I just can't get over it I've had it for years I'll never be able to escape it you know it'll never leave I just it's always going to be the same brothers and sisters if that's what you say then that's what it'll be but if you're willing to take God at his word and say I'm going to pull that sword I know the prophet of God said it I don't understand it I just believe it that's the only thing we're supposed to do is just believe not understand it and explain it away if you can do that then you don't have real faith you don't have faith in the word you got an understanding you got a comprehension you got the ability to to believe in something other than the word of God he says they Strode their dead bodies pull the sword now he says let's go forth and slay these goliaths out of here they Strode their dead bodies plumbed to The Valleys up over the hillsides to the gates and we know that he's talking about the story of David and Goliath and remember that's what happened they were there boasting and nobody in the camp was willing to go forwards everyone was afraid of it when we get a Goliath he's going to come brothers and sisters count on it Goliath is going to come into our camp he's going to be standing and he's going to be boasting and he's going to be saying you can't do nothing look at you he's going to go on and on and on and on and eventually someone I would say probably a little shrimp maybe a little child is going to stand up in the midst of the congregation and say but do you know that's not according to the word of God why are we letting this giant boast he's not even in his land he's in our land we have got full Authority and power over that devil what's wrong with everyone here that's how God works he raises up a shrimp someone little a nobody and that person is going to go forwards and say hey you know what you come to me with swords and staves but I come to you in the name of the Living God and today I'm going to cut your head off and the whole Army's gonna see it and what's going to happen it's going to increase Faith we're going to get Faith like we've never had before we're going to have faith that nobody's ever going to shake and you know brothers and sisters I can't help but believe it that's why I'm preaching it the way I am tonight this is where my heart is I believe God wants to do this in our congregation in our midst we don't have to tolerate Giants in our lives you don't have to doesn't matter how big it is how small it is how insignificant maybe how embarrassing or secret it is it's a devil it's a giant the word says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another and you shall be healed you want to take that devil's head off take the word of God stay straight on that word of God and you'll take his head off and the next time he comes around you can show him no look at your buddy here you want the same thing he's going to scram he's going to be afraid because the word of the God says submit yourself therefore unto God then resist the devil and he will flee from you you don't run from him I just want to read this again I think it's so beautiful they strolled their dead bodies plumbed to The Valleys up over the hillsides to the gates sure you can do it it's yours it's for you it's all it's for every believer and you know we're not slaying physical people here we're not talking about that we're talking about devils satanic devils they've got their guns trained on the Bride of Jesus Christ that is the battle line that's the front line today brothers and sisters we're not wrestling against flesh and blood you're not wrestling against your brother and your sister you're not wrestling against that other minister you're not wrestling against all the deacons or the trustees or all this business this world has to present to us according to our natural senses we're wrestling against against principalities and Powers rulers of Darkness spiritual wickedness in high places this is a spiritual battle that we're dealing with but we have the ability to destroy their dead bodies Plum to The Valleys up over the hillsides and the gates sure you can do it too it's yours it's for it's for every believer remember we talked about it on Sunday I don't know how many people went and looked at it but what was the story about that that shrimp with that Nazarite vow with those little Seven Locks of curls hanging down his head that brother Branham called him what did he do he picked up the Jawbone of a mule just do it he was out just being himself he was just out doing what he does he wasn't wearing clergy clothes and and going to church and had his all men's all right and and was serving God perfectly according to the message of the hour he was just a normal believer doing his thing with the Nazarite vow wasn't he once upon a time I'd go so far as to say that he got the baptism of the Holy Spirit even though the Holy Spirit wasn't given then it's the same spirit in the Old Testament it's the same Spirit of the New Testament but somehow he got the Holy Spirit baptism and what did he do he picked up that Jawbone of a mule that should have just disintegrated to powder in the first hit and every time he did that I think it's so beautiful what did he do he increased his testimony and what he did was he just just just Sanctified that bow he just increased that Nazarite bow every single time he did it and how many times did he do it for a thousand Philistines for a thousand trained Army how many times did he swing that thing I think it's beautiful he was just out being himself he wasn't trying to be anybody he just found himself in the open and then suddenly there's a thousand pills Philippines and they're looking to do them in they wanted to get him the power of God came on them brothers and sisters count on it you're going to be out in the open and there's going to be a thousand Philistines and what are you gonna do what are we going to do you know we can get on the phone and call everyone and say we need prayer we can send out an SOS text message or we can say God I I I I I'm nobody but I know that I've got your token I know that you've dealt with me individually and Lord I know that you have called me to where I'm at today and because of that you will make a way through this problem and you know what I know that you will stroll the bodies all over the place number 50 says don't leave this building tonight without having the Holy Spirit cut away that old blind shackle that stands there throw the thing away say I believe God and walk out of here like a man or a woman a child of God with the Victory and The Morning Star leading you marching on to Glory the devil raised up and say well I thought you I thought I had you say to him I told you you didn't walk right on that's it don't stand to have a conversation with them don't open up a dialogue and start a text thread don't do it don't listen to his rattle just walk on that's it come back at the next meeting shake that old head of that old devil that had you bound say looky here you remember me I was that person I was up there I was the person sitting here and the doctor said I couldn't live but for a few days longer here I am yet tonight Hallelujah and you know brothers and sisters the reason why I got so much inspiration is I know sister Tina did that exact thing multiple times she was in the hospital the doctors were saying oh no no it's not good it's not good and she said you know what I know I'm not gonna stay here I'm going out of this hospital because God's My Healer he said then somebody said you know if she can do it I can too take him at his word brothers and sisters when we see someone do it when God blesses someone according to his word if you come the same way that's what the prophet said when you come the same way God will honor your faith too because you're not you're not bringing your own faith if you see him move in a situation it's not his faith I mean it's not your faith it's not my faith it's his faith doing it that's why I think it's so beautiful with such a revelation for me early in the spring it's not us doing it we can jump up and down and scream and shout brother Bradham says it pour a gallon of oil right nothing's going to move a devil except for the word of God oh my but when it's the word of God the true word of God on the heart of a Believer a devil is going to run for his life then somebody said you know if she can do it I can too so I'll trust him amen you don't know what's the matter tonight oh how the Holy Spirit likes to get people into a bunch likes to get into a bunch of people like this now if you could only realize where you're at only realize not say in this building you're in Christ positionally in our positions brothers and sisters is where the power lies positionally everything's yours all yours it belongs to you do you now believe people might say well I'm just here at Calgary Living Word and it's just just this church in Calgary if you've come to that then you've missed the point because we're not coming unto the the Church of of of of a a many-membered body that's according to denominationalism we're coming to the Church of the Living Christ Jesus we're coming into the unfailing body word of Christ only realize not say in this building you're in Christ positionally everything's yours all yours it belongs to you I want to say this if we can apply Ephesians chapter 5 and and six and there's other scriptures that go along with it we're going to see God move in our homes we're going to see God moving our lives and you know I can say this brothers and sisters I I this all started I don't know how long ago we started preaching this but it started with me saying you know I I think it'd be really good to get a good teacher to come in and start preaching this to our church and and really get this going and you know I believe the Lord said to me you know what it doesn't start there it starts with you if you're the pastor it's your responsibility you need to know this stuff and so I started to dig into it and I thought wow this is amazing but you know it's not for me although it is for my family it's for everyone will see success in their lives if we can apply this word I just think it's beautiful tonight to know what the Holy Spirit likes what our husband likes if we can understand what he likes brothers and sisters give him what he's likes give them do what he likes just do what he likes you'll please him and when he's pleased I guarantee you he's going to please you he's going to give us our desires they might not come exactly the way that we think they should come or the way that we want them to come but when they do come we'll look back and we'll say Lord thank you because this is the way it had to be in order for this to happen the way that it has I might not have seen it this way we can't explain God away 1955-0724 enticing spirits paragraph 178. I love the way the prophet expresses it he says my I feel like the Rapture is just above the church oh it makes me feel so good all sins under the blood see the Holy Spirit likes the word the word is what the Holy Spirit feeds on you see oh my and that's why I just think it's so sad so sad we can have now we're at the place where we have people I'm not done with that one by the way but we have people who will Heap to themselves having teachers heaps of themselves teachers having itchy ears we can we've never had a time like we can do it right now there's people that actually will sit in a church and and they'll have the the ability to feed upon the word in the church and and then go home and actually have their favorite Pastor feed them the word as well then there's others that will actually not even go to church and they'll just have the the favorite Pastor or minister in in in whatever congregation they have online and they'll be able to stream them brothers and sisters that's not applying the word of God in your life you're actually not pleasing the Holy Spirit by doing that and that's just brother Barry speaking I know some people will say oh that's just brother Barry speaking that but you know what you you can take it or leave it it's fine but if you want to see the word of God operate in your life try Ephesians chapter 4 where it talks about there being prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors and see if the five-fold ministry doesn't actually play a part in in the word of God in our lives and when we do that brothers and sisters again then we'll see the Holy Spirit pleased in our lives and again he will come around and pour out a blessing that you might not even be able to contain because if you do that then you hold God responsible to what to his word not to your opinion not to your Traditions or teachings not not applying the other part of the scripture saying that they're ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth some folks are like that we don't want to be that way we want to say Lord I take you at your word and I might not understand it like I said I might not understand it but I'm just going to give it to you I'm going to say I'm going to go forwards and do it and ask you to show me that that's the way you want it done and I promise you'll do it he will he says my I feel like the Rapture is just above the church oh it makes me feel so good all sins are under the blood see the Holy Spirit likes the word the word is what the Holy Spirit feeds on you see oh my it comes down and gets among the people cleanses their sins takes away their sickness takes their Blues Away now I'm drunk just drunk as I can be drunk on the spirit love drawing out of my heart no matter what anybody has had ever done it's forgiven your bitterest enemy it's all over 1957-0310 e hear ye him paragraph 28. I just love seeing the prophet of God say it and that's why I bring the quotes I want to stay straight on the word I don't ever want to deviate from it even though I have a feeling and maybe a desire I I feel inspired about a certain thing I want to make sure that that's what he says about it and if he doesn't say it then I don't want to say it because even though I feel that way it doesn't do me any good and it doesn't do anybody any good we've got to make sure it's what the prophet said it's what the word of God said paragraph 28 of this scripture or this message sorry hear ye him 1957. oh I wished I had the voice and could stand here in the time we could lay on that for hours of the Disobedience of the church to God and the Holy Spirit is bringing that word back and forth now but what if that child has done good but the bottom is talking about the story of the tutor here just for time's sake I'm gonna I'm just gonna say it he's talking about the tutor now the tutor gives the story back to the father about the one child and and the story back to the father about the other child now but what if that child has done good oh how the Holy Spirit likes to bring their character how the teacher would like to come to the father and say are you the father of the child can you imagine this the Holy Spirit going back and saying are you the father of that child Brother Don snow are you his father I am not I will be not I was I am all right I want to tell you that little fellow is one of the smartest little chaps I've ever seen oh even though he's youthful he's just oh he's a chip off the old block that's all he loves you he's just exactly like you he's about your business he stands just exactly firm on what you say why he's just like you how that teacher likes to say that and how are we ever going to express that character back how are we ever going to show that to the tutor for him to go and have that conversation with the Father the only way is by his word the only way is by speaking his word the only way is by eating his word the only way is by living his word and really the only way any of that's going to happen is just to give way just to yield to submit ourselves in the fear of God and allow him to come into our lives the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and let him live out this word because then he'll take the report back that we want to give he says what do you think the father thinks when that happens what do you think the father thinks swells out his chest That's my boy oh God how I hope I hope I can be obedient enough till the father will be pleased with what I did I hope that you're obedient enough to be that it'll please God and you know brothers and sisters without faith it's impossible to please God let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 11. now we can get into our topic [Laughter] I love how the Lord does this I love it I love it once upon a time I thought my I don't know how I'm ever going to have enough enough words to say to get up there and preach but now I don't have enough time there's just not enough time Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for brother Branham says this faith that he's talking about here is an actual thing it's an actual substance just like in the universe there's different substances faith is also a substance you know that there's a light spectrum and there's radio waves and there's light that we can see and there's UV radiation UV light there's faith in the universe brothers and sisters you just can't see it with your eyes you can't feel it with your feelings it's not for our senses brother Bradham calls it The Sixth Sense faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain we know that he had a revelation didn't he why did he offer something different why did they both offer something different we know that Cain brought the fruit of the of the land and it was probably just a beautiful worship service it was flowery and it was fruity it probably had the best of everything and and Abel he just had a sharp rock and a and a lamb and he went and chopped the neck of that lamb until it bled to death and we know that Cain probably thought he was a lunatic and everyone else thought he was a lunatic why would he be doing that it was because he had faith and faith comes from God as a revelation in the heart of a believer by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts if you would just do like your brother then your sacrifice would be accepted right God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God brothers and sisters tonight I want to say it I'll call the musicians because we're at the end but what is it that pleases God what is it that the Holy Spirit likes what does our husband like in our lives he likes faith faith in his word not not mixed and mingled with with denominational teaching with former thoughts and ideas with maybe family tradition he's not interested in culture he's not even interested in our perfect form and mechanics in here he's interested in submitted Hearts the ones that are willing to say just be it unto me according to Thy word that's what he's looking for brothers and sisters verse six is where I want to get to but without faith it is impossible to please him we can bring all of our flowers and all of our fruits we can bring all of our best efforts we can tithe we can tithe 90 and keep ten right but we don't got faith it does nothing and we know that that we can talk about it from from from the aspect of Paul talking uh I can't remember where it's at exactly but but we we got to have faith and and perfect love brother random talked about it perfect love is really what it takes the statue of the perfect man and unless we have those things is and the only way we're going to get it is the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Spirit repent for your sins get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the opening of this word for you in your lives and you know what if if maybe that sounds like something that's just I can't even understand that why would I do that I've already been baptized in titles well titles aren't names who's the father who is the son who's the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is what's going to unlock this scripture for us brother if we don't come according to the formula we can't expect to get the results without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is [Music] and
