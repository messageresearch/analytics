[43:00] amen Lord bless you
[43:02] all yesterday we
[43:05] had men's
[43:07] meeting and I was just really blessed by
[43:09] it and as an encourager I have to
[43:13] encourage yesterday I was just thinking
[43:15] on all of the comments and things that
[43:17] were said and it was just impressed on
[43:19] my heart to take them and put them in a
[43:21] way that we could share it with the
[43:23] whole body because there's some great
[43:25] comments and great edifying of
[43:28] thoughts so there was 15 main points So
[43:32] it's 15 stands as long it's a little
[43:34] long but I I believe it'll be a
[43:36] blessing it's called the mantle of
[43:39] leadership in quiet
[43:42] strength and humble Grace a father's
[43:45] role
[43:47] molds not with loud declarations but in
[43:50] actions Brave and
[43:52] Bold conduct that speaks volumes a soft
[43:56] guiding light a Watchmen against the
[43:59] darkness correcting wrongs into right
[44:03] when a father kneels in prayer humbly
[44:06] seeking Grace children see a True
[44:09] servant's Heart a Meek and sacred Place
[44:13] their young eyes witness power and
[44:16] bowing low learning to serve in
[44:19] reverence their Spirits
[44:21] grow for by the life we live our
[44:25] children's eyes perceive

[44:33] believe encouragement in families like
[44:36] rain to Thirsty ground always bring a
[44:40] harvest Rich where once no hope was
[44:43] found can our youth find safety in the

[44:49] deepest fears and needs their stories to
[44:52] be told voicing them to their parents

[1:00:13] PM June 26th which is a Wednesday we'll
[1:00:16] have brother Cadre Diggs here Lord
[1:00:19] willing and

[1:00:40] July the 12th we're certainly excited to
[1:00:42] see the lineup of Brothers come through
[1:00:45] it seems that Calgary is becoming a a
[1:00:47] more and more popular place for uh
[1:00:50] brothers and sisters to travel through
[1:00:52] and we just want to try and be sensitive
[1:00:55] to the spirit of the the Lord and just
[1:00:57] see what the Lord will do through our
[1:00:59] brothers when they come are you happy
[1:01:01] this
[1:01:03] morning I just uh personally I I don't
[1:01:07] really want to try and be the person
[1:01:09] that's super spiritual but I just you
[1:01:13] know sometimes think about when we
[1:01:15] preach and when we talk about things of
[1:01:17] the Lord how the Devil comes around and
[1:01:20] some might say well brother Barry just
[1:01:22] you know you yelled on Wednesday but I
[1:01:25] think it's what I yelled that really
[1:01:27] caused a little bit of persecution in my
[1:01:29] body I really got it after Wednesday
[1:01:32] night and so I just couldn't help but
[1:01:34] think you know where where did we leave
[1:01:36] off on Wednesday I feel like we should
[1:01:37] just pick up right from there and and
[1:01:40] set the stage for for what we're doing
[1:01:42] because we're we're not preaching to the
[1:01:44] Lost we know that this ministry is to
[1:01:47] the total lost because the entire world
[1:01:50] isn't going to be able to receive the
[1:01:51] message of the hour but there is an
[1:01:53] elected class of people there is a very
[1:01:56] special class of people a prophetic
[1:01:59] people one with prophetic Insight that
[1:02:01] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[1:02:04] saith unto the church they have been
[1:02:06] given an ear not ears it's not plural
[1:02:10] it's a singular ear for one word and
[1:02:12] that's the word of God and I just want
[1:02:14] to read this uh out of the samonian
[1:02:16] church age you you I don't know if you
[1:02:18] want to bring it up you can if you want
[1:02:20] to um according to Romans
[1:02:23] 4:16 we find that God has given a sure
[1:02:26] promise to all of Abraham's seed and
[1:02:30] Paul puts himself and all believers
[1:02:33] under that
[1:02:35] designation because he says Abraham who
[1:02:38] is the father of us
[1:02:41] all then he goes on to not only narrow
[1:02:44] down his
[1:02:45] definition but rather to finalize it I
[1:02:50] was reading this this morning and it
[1:02:51] just made me laugh still makes me laugh
[1:02:54] to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he
[1:02:57] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[1:03:01] and counted the seed children as
[1:03:03] children of promise and promise as
[1:03:07] having to do with election or the
[1:03:09] choosing of God is there any seed of
[1:03:13] Promise here this morning and that is
[1:03:16] exactly what we have been
[1:03:19] saying these who are the Royal seed are
[1:03:23] the elect of God are the
[1:03:27] predestinated forn of God and were in
[1:03:30] the mind of God and His
[1:03:33] Thoughts this causes great dissension
[1:03:37] great problem in many people's lives
[1:03:39] because they will say if you speak about
[1:03:41] predestination then that means we're not
[1:03:43] free moral agents but that's not true we
[1:03:46] had a prophet in our day that said we
[1:03:48] are free moral agents God just simply
[1:03:50] knows what the outcome is going to be
[1:03:53] but we have to make the choice and you
[1:03:56] know what his children the Royal seed
[1:03:59] will always make the right
[1:04:01] choice always not just sometimes but
[1:04:05] always Amen in very plain language the
[1:04:08] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:04:11] God eternally though not expressed until
[1:04:14] each came forth in the designated
[1:04:17] decreed season oh my anyone who has the
[1:04:21] ability to hear the word of a Vindicated
[1:04:24] Prophet it's not the prophet's word is
[1:04:26] the word of God through the
[1:04:28] prophet that's what brings this elected
[1:04:30] seed to life brothers and sisters it's
[1:04:33] not the ability to say God sent a
[1:04:34] prophet that I know I've been to
[1:04:36] Jeffersonville I've been at the foot of
[1:04:39] Spring Street I have seen the Ohio River
[1:04:41] where that ball of fire came down all of
[1:04:43] that doesn't mean a thing if you can't
[1:04:46] hear the
[1:04:48] voice as each member came forth it
[1:04:51] became expressed and took its place in
[1:04:54] the body
[1:04:56] I'm so thankful that we can look and we
[1:04:58] can see expressed seed of God taking its
[1:05:02] place in the body where there's nothing
[1:05:04] that anybody can say there's nothing
[1:05:06] that anybody can do alls it is is a
[1:05:08] singularity towards the word of God it
[1:05:10] doesn't matter nothing's going to shake
[1:05:11] me to the right hand or the left it
[1:05:13] doesn't matter whatever you want to try
[1:05:14] and come up with with a new new new
[1:05:16] fandangled thing maybe believe the sign
[1:05:19] maybe this maybe that it doesn't matter
[1:05:20] I've already met the the the king of
[1:05:22] kings and Lord of lords that's what
[1:05:24] happens when we get the Holy Ghost we
[1:05:26] begin to realize that we are that seed
[1:05:29] being expressed in this
[1:05:31] age it's just
[1:05:35] beautiful and I just think the devil
[1:05:37] hates
[1:05:37] this and the reason he hates this is
[1:05:40] because this elected seed is actually
[1:05:43] predestinated to go on for
[1:05:45] eternity as a part of God himself
[1:05:49] because they were Eternal thoughts of
[1:05:51] God before the foundation of the world
[1:05:53] just like Satan and this is where I
[1:05:55] think he really got upset because Satan
[1:05:57] was actually a thought of God but not an
[1:06:00] eternal thought of God Satan was a
[1:06:04] thought just like Esau was a
[1:06:07] thought someone had to be destroyed
[1:06:10] that's that the law of election might
[1:06:12] stand and it's not up to us to say it's
[1:06:14] good or bad you know nature is neither
[1:06:16] good or bad nature just is some animals
[1:06:19] eat other animals and it's really sad
[1:06:22] everything has to live on life and you
[1:06:26] even hear brother brandham talk about I
[1:06:27] thought it was the funniest thing ever
[1:06:28] you hear people saying you got to save
[1:06:30] the animals and you got to save you know
[1:06:32] all of this stuff brother Bram talks
[1:06:34] about you know what some people eat
[1:06:35] potatoes and you're killing potatoes
[1:06:38] some people eat zucchinis and you have
[1:06:40] to kill that zucchini to eat it that
[1:06:42] zucchini has to Die the wheat has to die
[1:06:45] we know the seed has to go down into the
[1:06:48] ground and die but there is a germ
[1:06:50] inside that seed that can never die
[1:06:52] brothers and sisters it's so beautiful
[1:06:53] and that's what becomes expressed thus
[1:06:56] this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:06:59] seed bride when she hears that word of
[1:07:02] God spoken by a Vindicated Prophet not
[1:07:05] the prophet's word God's word through
[1:07:07] the Vindicated Prophet it brings a life
[1:07:10] inside of that person to come forth and
[1:07:13] it becomes that Express seed and though
[1:07:15] she is feminine of designation she is
[1:07:17] also called the body of Christ it is
[1:07:19] very apparent that she ought to be
[1:07:21] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:07:24] him and came from the same Source was
[1:07:28] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:07:31] what God in a many membered
[1:07:35] body not manifesting ourselves not
[1:07:37] manifesting our churches if that's what
[1:07:39] we're doing we've missed the
[1:07:42] point whereas once God was manifested in
[1:07:45] one member even our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:49] isn't it beautiful what happened at
[1:07:51] Calvary it's terrible because he
[1:07:53] suffered
[1:07:55] but he suffered so that he could break
[1:07:57] the blood cell and actually go back up
[1:08:01] and sit at the right hand of the father
[1:08:03] and then redistribute his Spirit to the
[1:08:05] many membered body one Spirit one mind
[1:08:10] one Accord not many different directions
[1:08:12] not many different ideas and theories no
[1:08:16] paragraph 174 now then here we are
[1:08:18] coming to a conclusion as the Eternal
[1:08:20] logos God was manifest in the Sun and in
[1:08:23] Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:08:24] godhead body
[1:08:26] and we know that that's Colossians 2:9
[1:08:29] that's not just something that the
[1:08:30] prophet said all of the fullness of the
[1:08:33] godhe head bodily was in Jesus Christ
[1:08:36] Jesus Christ was God manifest In the
[1:08:39] Flesh to be our kinsman redeemer and
[1:08:42] that Eternal one was the father manifest
[1:08:44] in flesh and thereby gained the title of
[1:08:46] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[1:08:50] in our turn became the many membered
[1:08:53] spoken word seed
[1:08:56] manifest in flesh and those Eternal
[1:08:58] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[1:09:02] sons of God even as we are so calleded I
[1:09:05] know there's some people out there that
[1:09:07] say one day we're going to be the sons
[1:09:09] of God right now we are the sons of God
[1:09:11] is what the word of God says Brethren
[1:09:14] now we are the sons of God though we
[1:09:16] don't know what we're going to look like
[1:09:18] but we know that when we see him we
[1:09:20] shall be like
[1:09:21] him and how are we going to recognize it
[1:09:24] because we're going to actually line up
[1:09:25] with his word amen that's how we're
[1:09:27] going to see him that's how we're going
[1:09:29] to recognize Jesus Christ we're going to
[1:09:31] see people that line up exactly with his
[1:09:34] word we did not become seed by the
[1:09:36] rebirth we didn't just one day stumble
[1:09:38] into the mission on the corner brother
[1:09:39] bradam said our parents didn't just lead
[1:09:41] us to Christ and suddenly we became born
[1:09:44] again the only way that we can be born
[1:09:46] again is if we were actually the elected
[1:09:48] of God before the foundation of the
[1:09:50] world and one day we just recognize that
[1:09:56] oh
[1:09:57] my we were seed and therefore we were
[1:10:01] reborn for only the elect can be
[1:10:06] reborn oh my it doesn't make us better
[1:10:09] than anyone in fact it makes us almost
[1:10:13] worse than everyone because we recognize
[1:10:15] there's nothing that we could ever do
[1:10:17] there's nothing that we ever have done
[1:10:20] there's nothing that we could ever
[1:10:22] muster up on our own to Merit the
[1:10:25] goodness of God in our life he simply
[1:10:27] chose us in him before the foundation of
[1:10:30] the world to come to the world to be
[1:10:32] expressed in the age in which we live
[1:10:34] and to give us all that we have need of
[1:10:37] and alls we have to do is acknowledge
[1:10:38] Him alls we've got to be I'm getting
[1:10:40] into the the next phase of our our study
[1:10:42] but all we've got to do is worship him
[1:10:44] that's the only thing he wants is the
[1:10:46] praise from our
[1:10:48] lips that's all he wants dad he just
[1:10:51] wants to hear thank you amen thank you
[1:10:54] from his son's
[1:10:55] daughters those ones that really are
[1:10:58] elected and predestinated will recognize
[1:11:00] it and they will thank him they won't
[1:11:03] say my culture says I can't do this and
[1:11:05] it's just the way I'm built no way no I
[1:11:08] don't buy it and neither does he but
[1:11:11] anyways we'll get into all that later I
[1:11:13] think it's so
[1:11:14] beautiful that was just for free
[1:11:16] brothers and sisters I just wanted to
[1:11:17] have a little warmup for my voice here
[1:11:20] today oh my like as I said I really kind
[1:11:24] of got it this week and uh you know
[1:11:26] maybe I deserved it for for saying the
[1:11:28] words that I
[1:11:34] did but I just want to preach this word
[1:11:37] I want to preach it in season I don't
[1:11:39] want to preach a word for another age
[1:11:41] because there's many other ages out
[1:11:43] there but we know brother bradam said a
[1:11:44] word for for Noah's age wouldn't save
[1:11:47] anybody today and even if Jesus came a
[1:11:50] and started to preach maybe Jeremiah's
[1:11:53] day it wouldn't work
[1:11:55] we have to preach the word in season and
[1:11:59] what we're looking for is a body change
[1:12:02] no that's what we're after and only
[1:12:06] those who are truly elected seed Sons
[1:12:09] and Daughters of God are those who will
[1:12:11] go in the Rapture who will actually see
[1:12:14] the body change there's going to be a
[1:12:16] lot of people who actually pretend to be
[1:12:19] Christians and you know what's going to
[1:12:21] happen is they're going to be worshiping
[1:12:23] Satan and not even realizing
[1:12:25] it brother Ram says millions and
[1:12:28] billions of impersonators of
[1:12:31] Christianity but we're not preaching to
[1:12:33] those people today we're preaching to
[1:12:35] the truly elect Sons and Daughters of
[1:12:38] God and so you know I I just want to get
[1:12:40] into our study today and uh if you could
[1:12:43] turn with me over to the Book of Daniel
[1:12:46] we'll get into the next
[1:12:49] uh portion the next phase remember
[1:12:53] excuse me we've been talking about the
[1:12:54] will of of God and
[1:12:58] understanding what the will of God is
[1:13:00] for us in our
[1:13:02] lives I have said that you know and and
[1:13:05] I believe it with all my heart we have
[1:13:07] thus sayeth the Lord the prophet said it
[1:13:09] the bride has thus sayith the
[1:13:12] Lord and the mind of Christ to know what
[1:13:14] to do with us sayeth the Lord and some
[1:13:16] people don't have it and they keep still
[1:13:18] and that's fine we don't want to say one
[1:13:20] way or the other the way we should go
[1:13:22] other than I I I personally believe the
[1:13:24] Bri has thus sayith the Lord we've been
[1:13:26] given the entire book
[1:13:29] open these aren't just stories and fairy
[1:13:32] tales that we talk about when we talk
[1:13:34] about sunset Mountain and we talk about
[1:13:37] the cloud picture we talk about the
[1:13:39] pillar of fire picture we talk about
[1:13:41] sabinal Canyon and the sword of the king
[1:13:45] being placed back in the hand of a
[1:13:48] prophet that's not just for a prophet
[1:13:49] brothers and sisters that's the Baton of
[1:13:52] the word that Adam lost being handed
[1:13:55] right back to man
[1:13:57] again he's given us a mind not our mind
[1:14:00] his
[1:14:01] mind the
[1:14:03] bride has the mind of Christ amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah she has thus saith the Lord
[1:14:09] and the mind of Christ to know what to
[1:14:11] do with us sayeth the Lord it's not
[1:14:13] about getting a Ferrari it's not about
[1:14:15] getting a yacht it's not about getting
[1:14:17] big bank account a a tremendous
[1:14:19] portfolio it's not about having better
[1:14:22] clothes or houses it's about getting
[1:14:24] ourselves in a Rapture and seeing our
[1:14:26] family go with us and sitting under the
[1:14:29] shade of a tree in the
[1:14:31] Millennium talking to our children's
[1:14:34] children's
[1:14:36] children that's what we're talking about
[1:14:39] the will of God brothers and sisters I
[1:14:42] would never want to say that we should
[1:14:44] just flippantly go forwards in our life
[1:14:47] and just make
[1:14:48] decisions without seeking the will of
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:51] Lord because his word is his will and
[1:14:55] it's a treacherous day in which we live
[1:14:57] and the devil wants us to make decisions
[1:15:00] outside of God's word because when we
[1:15:02] make decisions outside of God's word
[1:15:04] then we're not in his perfect will when
[1:15:06] we're not in his perfect will he's going
[1:15:07] to take us for a ride and we're going to
[1:15:09] go on a bumpy ride I was R this week I
[1:15:13] was I was trying to mow our lawn and I
[1:15:16] was rushing quickly riding a tractor and
[1:15:19] you know we have a bit of a hill at our
[1:15:20] house and I was going down the hill and
[1:15:22] there's really no breaks when you're
[1:15:23] going down and as I was going down it's
[1:15:25] bumpy and I just couldn't help but think
[1:15:28] you know man that's bumpy and you know
[1:15:31] sometimes in our lives we've got to go
[1:15:33] on a bumpy ride that's the way it is and
[1:15:36] there's nothing that we can do about it
[1:15:38] except for trust him trust the Lord but
[1:15:41] it's at that point we need to know
[1:15:43] exactly where we stand it's not at that
[1:15:46] point that we need to go and start
[1:15:48] flipping rocks in our lives and seeing
[1:15:50] what's going on where we went wrong we
[1:15:53] need to seek his will diligently brother
[1:15:55] and sisters I would never want to
[1:15:57] encourage anyone to just go willy-nilly
[1:15:59] out make sure that your decision is
[1:16:02] based upon his word and his voice in
[1:16:05] your heart make sure that those line
[1:16:09] up and if you're not sure maybe ask
[1:16:13] someone get someone to pray with you and
[1:16:16] see if God won't reveal it but seek the
[1:16:19] will of the Lord diligently but also be
[1:16:21] very courageous and March forward and
[1:16:24] you know brothers and sisters this is
[1:16:25] where I think it just it just can you
[1:16:27] can go from from just maybe being stuck
[1:16:30] in first gear and not being able to go
[1:16:32] any faster maybe in a spiritual walk if
[1:16:35] you can just get the Holy Ghost in your
[1:16:37] life then you have that Assurance you
[1:16:38] know you have him in your boat then you
[1:16:40] can March forward he won't allow you to
[1:16:43] actually make
[1:16:44] mistakes but we need to know that it's
[1:16:46] the Holy Ghost in our life and he's not
[1:16:48] going to share his glory with anyone
[1:16:50] it's not going to be us plus him him
[1:16:52] plus us it's only going to be him in our
[1:16:55] lives fully surrendered Sons and
[1:16:57] Daughters of God those are going to be
[1:16:59] the ones that have the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:01] their life that's going to give us the
[1:17:03] ability to be very courageous and March
[1:17:05] forward and that's sort of the the
[1:17:07] aspect or the direction that I'm taking
[1:17:08] this from is is matured Sons and
[1:17:10] Daughters of God where we can go
[1:17:12] forwards with courage where we can have
[1:17:15] the Assurance of knowing that he's going
[1:17:17] to lead us and guide us and if we're
[1:17:19] going to make a wrong decision he's
[1:17:20] going to correct our path he's not just
[1:17:23] going to let us go first because why
[1:17:25] because matured Sons and Daughters of
[1:17:27] God are going to seek ye first the
[1:17:30] kingdom of God they're not just going to
[1:17:32] say I'm going to go and run after this
[1:17:33] job because I don't have a job here so
[1:17:35] I'm going to run there to get a job and
[1:17:37] and when I get that job then I'm going
[1:17:39] to seek the kingdom of God no I'm going
[1:17:41] to seek the kingdom of God right now and
[1:17:44] trust that God is going to lead me and
[1:17:46] then if God leads me there praise the
[1:17:48] Lord I'm going to follow the
[1:17:52] lord and then all these things shall be
[1:17:54] added unto
[1:17:56] you but if we're looking for him to add
[1:17:58] all these things to us look out we're
[1:18:01] seeking our own will that's when we get
[1:18:03] into the permissive will of God and
[1:18:05] we're going to go on a bumpy ride but
[1:18:08] you know if we just lean not unto our
[1:18:09] own
[1:18:11] understanding just just not onto our own
[1:18:13] understanding and I love that scripture
[1:18:15] because it says
[1:18:17] lean
[1:18:19] lean lean when we're leaning brothers
[1:18:22] and sisters we're actually putting
[1:18:25] action into something aren't we we're
[1:18:28] putting our trust in something we're
[1:18:31] leaning on it we're putting our weight
[1:18:33] against it I'm trusting this Pulpit
[1:18:34] right now by leaning on it I'm lifting
[1:18:36] one foot I'm leaning on this Pulpit
[1:18:39] trusting that it's going to hold me up
[1:18:41] and not harm me imagine if we could do
[1:18:43] that with the Lord lean not unto our own
[1:18:47] understanding not unto our own
[1:18:49] understanding but lean unto his
[1:18:51] understanding lean not unto our own
[1:18:54] understanding and in
[1:18:55] all of our ways acknowledge Him and what
[1:19:01] happens then he will direct our path
[1:19:04] brothers and sisters but many times we
[1:19:07] don't acknowledge Him in all of our
[1:19:09] ways many times we start to just do
[1:19:12] things on our own and we know that James
[1:19:15] talks about it so that even when our
[1:19:17] prayer we ask a Miss because we consume
[1:19:19] it upon our lusts now it's not a
[1:19:22] necessarily A perversion don't get me
[1:19:24] wrong
[1:19:25] the lust that he's talking about are
[1:19:27] this flesh desires the pride of life oh
[1:19:31] my I'm somebody look what I've done
[1:19:34] we've done nothing he's done it all the
[1:19:37] only reason we have an ounce of success
[1:19:39] in our life is because he first gave it
[1:19:41] to us lean not unto our own
[1:19:44] understanding in all your ways
[1:19:46] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:19:49] path now remember brothers and sisters
[1:19:51] his will is his word this is where we're
[1:19:52] going today we're talking about his will
[1:19:54] this is what we want to get into his
[1:19:56] will is his word and we know that Thy
[1:19:59] word is a lamp unto my
[1:20:03] feet and a light unto my path so if
[1:20:07] we're putting his word first he's going
[1:20:09] to show us where we need to go brothers
[1:20:12] and sisters and you know it might only
[1:20:13] be one step at a time we might have a
[1:20:16] big staircase in front of us and we
[1:20:18] might only see that one step and we
[1:20:20] might not even be able to see that step
[1:20:22] but we got to be willing to step by
[1:20:24] faith knowing that he is directing us
[1:20:27] and if we don't know we got a
[1:20:30] problem you know all we need to do
[1:20:32] brother bradam said it just go back to
[1:20:33] where you got off cuz somewhere along
[1:20:35] the way matured Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:37] God have had a relationship with the
[1:20:39] Lord and the only thing we need to do is
[1:20:41] get right with God go back to where we
[1:20:42] got off and you know what he will Purge
[1:20:45] us he will cleanse us if we're willing
[1:20:47] to be completely honest with him he'll
[1:20:49] be completely honest with us but he'll
[1:20:51] Purge us of all the garbage in our life
[1:20:54] and what will happen happen he'll start
[1:20:55] filling us
[1:20:56] again but we have the ability to
[1:20:59] recognize that he has done it all and we
[1:21:02] don't need to be afraid we can be very
[1:21:04] strong and courageous just like the Book
[1:21:06] of Joshua every place the soul of your
[1:21:09] foot stands the soul of your foot treads
[1:21:12] in the promised land of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:14] is yours don't be afraid just March
[1:21:18] forward but if you don't have the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost if you're afraid to go
[1:21:23] on then what you going to stay on this
[1:21:27] side
[1:21:27] Jordan even those
[1:21:30] tribes I feel led to get into that
[1:21:32] sometime too those two tribes that
[1:21:34] stayed on this side Jordan they still
[1:21:36] had to go and fight for their Brethren
[1:21:39] that was the only place the only way
[1:21:40] they could actually inherit that land
[1:21:42] they still had to stand shoulder toosh
[1:21:44] shoulder with their Brethren some people
[1:21:46] brothers and sisters don't want to go
[1:21:47] all the way across Jordan and that's
[1:21:49] fine but you know what we're brothers
[1:21:51] and sisters and we're still going to
[1:21:52] fight together so that everybody gets
[1:21:54] their possession and that's the way it
[1:21:56] works as
[1:21:58] Believers out of 1952 for him will I
[1:22:03] accept talking about God's
[1:22:06] will brother Bram says but God has to
[1:22:09] keep his promise in order to be
[1:22:13] God sorry brother did you get
[1:22:16] the I think I did email it I'm sorry I
[1:22:18] should have said it
[1:22:20] earlier
[1:22:22] yeah for him will I accept in
[1:22:29] 1952 but God has to keep his promise in
[1:22:31] order to be
[1:22:33] God if he doesn't keep his promise then
[1:22:36] he isn't
[1:22:37] God pretty simple isn't
[1:22:40] it if he doesn't keep his promise then
[1:22:42] he isn't God now I I I just want to say
[1:22:45] this brothers and sisters by saying if
[1:22:47] he doesn't keep his promise then he
[1:22:49] isn't God if he doesn't answer our
[1:22:52] prayer the way that we want our prayer
[1:22:53] answered doesn't mean that he's not God
[1:22:56] the promise is that we are the truly
[1:22:58] elected seed of God and that we will
[1:23:00] reign with him forever that we will be
[1:23:03] Eternal just as he is eternal that's the
[1:23:05] promise of God we can say many times we
[1:23:09] have prayers that we want him to answer
[1:23:10] a certain way a certain way a certain
[1:23:12] way even according to his word he's
[1:23:14] going to answer the prayer the way he
[1:23:15] wants to answer it and we have to be
[1:23:18] willing to accept
[1:23:19] that and we talked about that a while
[1:23:21] ago brother Bram has a quote and he says
[1:23:23] even when he doesn't answer the prayer
[1:23:25] the way that we expect it we love him
[1:23:27] just as much in in fact we love him more
[1:23:30] because we know it's for our good which
[1:23:32] is a very difficult thing to understand
[1:23:35] sometimes we can't even understand that
[1:23:37] we just have to trust there's things
[1:23:39] that we'll know by and by brothers and
[1:23:40] sisters if he doesn't keep his promise
[1:23:43] then he isn't God now the main thing is
[1:23:45] is to find out whether it's the will of
[1:23:47] God it's easy to go God said tomorrow
[1:23:50] come down here in this in this audience
[1:23:52] and stood here and we really knew that
[1:23:54] it was the son of God knew he was and
[1:23:57] said go not any of you all any of you
[1:24:01] all tomorrow it's going to rain all day
[1:24:04] long well be easy for me to go home and
[1:24:08] just go to bed and say I ain't going out
[1:24:10] tomorrow because it's going to rain all
[1:24:11] day see cuz if he said so it's going to
[1:24:14] rain don't you believe
[1:24:17] that what what you know God's will is
[1:24:21] then you can look in God's word here and
[1:24:24] find God's will for you don't you
[1:24:27] believe that that's where we have to
[1:24:30] recognize brothers and sisters that
[1:24:32] every scripture has a compound meaning
[1:24:34] and
[1:24:35] Revelation and that's what the prophet
[1:24:37] taught us God through the prophet and
[1:24:41] then the only thing that this other does
[1:24:44] is straighten the individual see this is
[1:24:46] for the entire church for everybody and
[1:24:49] then if you can appropriate the faith
[1:24:51] clean yourself up or accept Jesus Christ
[1:24:53] believe him it's bound to bring God's
[1:24:56] word to pass cuz it's a
[1:24:58] seed you know just looking at the will
[1:25:01] of
[1:25:02] God it's mentioned 22 times in Scripture
[1:25:06] that quote specifically the will of God
[1:25:09] excuse me one
[1:25:16] second I apologize
[1:25:18] it's kind of embarrassing to do but I
[1:25:22] have to
[1:25:26] it's been a good week I've had uh bit of
[1:25:29] a cold
[1:25:31] and I know the Lord's healed me the will
[1:25:34] of God is mentioned 22 times in
[1:25:37] scripture but it's only mentioned in the
[1:25:39] New
[1:25:40] Testament isn't that
[1:25:42] interesting I I want to say this it's
[1:25:44] only mentioned under the New
[1:25:47] Covenant the will of God how many want
[1:25:51] the will of God for their lives
[1:25:55] I'm hot this
[1:25:57] morning I'm not prideful bear with me
[1:26:00] that sounded terrible it's very warm up
[1:26:03] here it's probably just where I'm at you
[1:26:06] know in Romans chapter 8 and he that
[1:26:08] searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
[1:26:11] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[1:26:13] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:26:15] the will of God he maketh intercession
[1:26:20] for the Saints in 1 Thessalonians 5:18
[1:26:23] and every
[1:26:24] thing give thanks for this is the will
[1:26:27] of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:26:33] you talking about our scripture that we
[1:26:36] haven't even gotten into yet we still
[1:26:38] have 45 plus or minus minutes here um
[1:26:43] I'd say we're doing pretty good for
[1:26:45] time Daniel chapter 1
[1:27:01] a very very interesting
[1:27:04] story in the third year of the reign of
[1:27:08] jeim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar
[1:27:12] King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and
[1:27:15] besieged
[1:27:16] it and the lord gave jeim of Judah into
[1:27:20] his hand with a part of the vessels of
[1:27:23] the house of God which he carried into
[1:27:25] the land of shinar to the house of his
[1:27:28] God and he brought the vessels into a
[1:27:31] treasure House of his God and the King
[1:27:34] spake unto
[1:27:35] ashpenaz the master of his Unix that he
[1:27:39] should bring certain of the children of
[1:27:42] Israel and of the king's seed and of the
[1:27:47] princes children in whom was no blemish
[1:27:51] but well favored and skillful in all
[1:27:53] wisdom and cunning and knowledge and
[1:27:56] understanding science and such as had
[1:27:59] the ability in them to stand in the
[1:28:01] king's Palace and whom they might teach
[1:28:05] the learning and the tongue of the
[1:28:09] Chaldeans talking about Daniel the story
[1:28:14] of
[1:28:15] Daniel this has come about through the
[1:28:18] discussion that I've had through
[1:28:20] studying a little bit about Joseph and
[1:28:23] how I Str struggled myself for years
[1:28:25] trying to understand what does it mean
[1:28:28] that the will of God is his word his
[1:28:31] word is his will it it really troubled
[1:28:35] me for a long time and I believe the
[1:28:37] Lord showed me that it's not necessarily
[1:28:40] a destination it's not necessarily an
[1:28:42] achievement it's not necessarily a
[1:28:45] position or a place the will of God is
[1:28:48] the actual journey and every decision
[1:28:51] that we make along the way is the will
[1:28:54] of God or
[1:28:56] not and two people in the Bible I
[1:28:59] believe the Lord showed me he said
[1:29:01] Joseph very clearly take a look at
[1:29:03] Joseph's life everywhere that he went he
[1:29:05] was blessed why was that because he put
[1:29:08] God first because it he sought the Lord
[1:29:11] first in every single thing in his life
[1:29:14] but Daniel um came up as the second name
[1:29:17] when I was having that conversation with
[1:29:18] the Lord I believe he was showing me if
[1:29:20] you've ever had a conversation with the
[1:29:22] Lord you understand when he speaks to
[1:29:24] your heart it becomes so clear you never
[1:29:26] forget it um brother Bram talks about
[1:29:30] sometimes we have dreams in our lives
[1:29:31] and they can be so vivid and we remember
[1:29:33] them we'll get into the quote a little
[1:29:34] bit later Lord willing but you know both
[1:29:36] of these men were dreamers and I'm not
[1:29:39] saying I'm a dreamer and I'm not saying
[1:29:41] that anybody is a dreamer I know some
[1:29:43] people have dreams and some people have
[1:29:44] really learned to lean upon the dreams
[1:29:47] as maybe a bit of a revelation from God
[1:29:49] but remember God through the prophet
[1:29:51] said that dreams are secondary dreams
[1:29:53] are always secondary the primary is the
[1:29:56] word of God the word of God and the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost directing us to the word of God in
[1:30:02] in the Book of Daniel here you know if
[1:30:05] you were to go back and read some of the
[1:30:06] prophets Ezekiel and and uh Jeremiah
[1:30:10] some of the stories about about uh
[1:30:13] Jerusalem being besieged 4600 people
[1:30:16] were taken out of Jerusalem in bondage
[1:30:19] when Nebuchadnezzar came in when jeak
[1:30:21] King jeho Kim was the king of Judah and
[1:30:24] we know that this King jeho Kim he he
[1:30:28] kept saying I don't understand why God
[1:30:31] just talks to this man when he he he
[1:30:34] could speak to me why doesn't he speak
[1:30:35] to me I'm the king but he wasn't
[1:30:38] recognizing what his forefathers knew
[1:30:40] and that was that God speaks through a
[1:30:43] prophet and he doesn't change his ways
[1:30:46] he doesn't change his nature he doesn't
[1:30:47] change his Essence but we know that
[1:30:49] that's what theological study wants to
[1:30:52] have happen that's what the Antichrist
[1:30:54] Spirit wants to do is to get people to
[1:30:56] believe that he does change his ways and
[1:30:58] he does change his Essence and his
[1:31:00] nature but he does not so 4600 people
[1:31:03] were taken in bondage out of Jerusalem
[1:31:06] at that time in in three separate
[1:31:08] occasions but the word says that it was
[1:31:10] 4600 people and we know that this
[1:31:13] ashpenaz he was commanded to bring
[1:31:15] certain children of Israel I just think
[1:31:18] this is so beautiful of the king's Not
[1:31:20] seeds of the king's seed singular recog
[1:31:23] recognizing that there was a group there
[1:31:25] was a lineage of people that were
[1:31:27] different than all of the rest and of
[1:31:29] the princes those people who had no
[1:31:31] blemish they were well favored they were
[1:31:34] skillful in all wisdom cunning in
[1:31:36] knowledge and understanding science and
[1:31:38] had the ability to stand in the king's
[1:31:41] Palace brothers and sisters I just can't
[1:31:44] help but think those are all prophetic
[1:31:46] words about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:49] some people might say brother Barry now
[1:31:51] you're getting a little bit crazy but
[1:31:52] tell me which one of the ride isn't
[1:31:54] going to fit that
[1:31:56] description in the sight of God not
[1:31:58] looking at one another no blemish well
[1:32:01] favored skilled in all
[1:32:03] wisdom sometimes we have jobs and we're
[1:32:06] able to perform our jobs in ways that we
[1:32:08] don't even know there's problems that
[1:32:11] need to be solved and and people say how
[1:32:14] are we ever going to fix this problem
[1:32:15] and we say we don't know we don't
[1:32:18] know but we've got a God that we can
[1:32:20] pray
[1:32:21] to and he's a living God and we'll just
[1:32:24] pray and ask him how we can solve this
[1:32:26] problem I mean we could take a poll and
[1:32:28] say how many people have ever
[1:32:29] experienced that you don't have to but
[1:32:31] why not has anybody ever done that
[1:32:33] before in your life if you have raise
[1:32:35] your hand I can do it it was one of the
[1:32:38] first things that I did when I got saved
[1:32:40] it was a silly silly story we were
[1:32:42] dealing with a customer who had this one
[1:32:45] service item and it was this endless
[1:32:48] problem with a front door on their house
[1:32:50] it was never perfect it was a front door
[1:32:53] that was supplied by the Builder and it
[1:32:54] was painted once and there was a blemish
[1:32:56] replace the whole door don't even paint
[1:32:58] it just get a brand new door so we
[1:32:59] replace it get it painted there's
[1:33:01] another
[1:33:03] blemish take the door back replace the
[1:33:05] door and there's another blemish and
[1:33:08] four times and when I just got saved I
[1:33:11] was saddled with going to try and deal
[1:33:12] with this customer this homeowner so we
[1:33:14] had to pick up the door from the
[1:33:15] supplier take it to a house where they
[1:33:17] were painting another residence where
[1:33:19] they were painting we had to get the
[1:33:21] door painted let it cure put it back in
[1:33:23] the haul it over to this house and
[1:33:26] actually take the old door off and put
[1:33:28] the new door on and and make sure that
[1:33:30] it's installed without a blemish that's
[1:33:32] very difficult to do because they get
[1:33:34] scratched they get handled there's a lot
[1:33:36] of different things and it might sound
[1:33:38] trivial and simple and truly it is in
[1:33:40] the sight of God but you know what I did
[1:33:41] was I committed it to God I said Lord I
[1:33:43] don't even know how I can do this this
[1:33:45] customer is already on fire for this
[1:33:47] door how will I ever be able to make
[1:33:49] this problem go away I don't see it
[1:33:51] happening the only way it'll happen is
[1:33:53] because you allow Lord and what happened
[1:33:55] was I was able to do it and you know it
[1:33:57] wasn't me that did it it was God that
[1:33:59] allowed it to happen but for me it was a
[1:34:00] simple little example to see just trust
[1:34:03] in the Lord with all thine heart and
[1:34:05] lean not unto thine own understanding I
[1:34:07] don't know how I'm going to do it but
[1:34:09] you know we have people who are skillful
[1:34:11] in wisdom and that wisdom is trusting in
[1:34:13] the Lord not recognizing that we have
[1:34:16] something in our own I just couldn't
[1:34:18] help but throw that in there it's just
[1:34:20] such a a wonderful thing it's a mighty
[1:34:22] God he's a mighty God that we serve
[1:34:24] brothers and sisters our everpresent
[1:34:26] help in time of
[1:34:28] trouble and you know I just can't help
[1:34:29] but think this is an example of all of
[1:34:31] our brothers and sisters and kin folk in
[1:34:33] the church verse 5 in Daniel chapter 1
[1:34:37] says the king appointed them a daily
[1:34:41] provision a daily
[1:34:44] provision and you know isn't that
[1:34:46] interesting how they would go from the
[1:34:49] Lord supplying all of their needs to now
[1:34:51] they've got this King and this King is
[1:34:54] supplying all of their provision I
[1:34:56] remember brother Ken preaching this the
[1:34:58] first time when I had ever heard it and
[1:34:59] I couldn't I couldn't understand it even
[1:35:02] a and and as time went on I just thought
[1:35:05] man that's so so rich here we had 4600
[1:35:09] people carried bondage out of Israel
[1:35:12] into the land of the Chaldeans under the
[1:35:15] leadership of King Nebuchadnezzar right
[1:35:18] a and what happened they went from
[1:35:20] actually worshiping under the law of
[1:35:23] Moses
[1:35:24] understanding the clean Beast
[1:35:26] understanding the dirty Beast
[1:35:27] understanding the the good food the bad
[1:35:29] food living according to the law living
[1:35:32] as good as they possibly could now
[1:35:33] they're being forced to eat from the
[1:35:35] king's table who would not want to eat
[1:35:37] of the best meat in the land or drink
[1:35:40] the best wine in the land who who really
[1:35:43] wouldn't want to you know there was four
[1:35:45] people four people out of 4600 people is
[1:35:49] what the Bible says four people stood up
[1:35:52] and said you know what
[1:35:54] uh we're we're we're just not going to
[1:35:56] do it it was only one man that spoke on
[1:35:58] behalf of all four of them but let's
[1:35:59] just continue reading here and the King
[1:36:01] appointed them a daily provision of the
[1:36:03] king's meat and of the wine which he
[1:36:05] drank so it would be the best in the
[1:36:07] land brothers and sisters so nourishing
[1:36:10] them three years that at the end thereof
[1:36:13] they might stand before the
[1:36:16] king now among these were of the
[1:36:19] children of Judah I think it's beautiful
[1:36:22] isn't it the tribe of Judah
[1:36:25] Daniel haniah Michelle and Azariah unto
[1:36:30] whom the prince of the Unix gave names
[1:36:33] for he gave unto Daniel the name of
[1:36:36] belto shazar and to haniah of Shadrach
[1:36:40] and Mel of meach and Azariah of Abednego
[1:36:45] and isn't it interesting how all of that
[1:36:48] happens they did it for a purpose they
[1:36:51] renamed them for a purpose to let them
[1:36:53] know you're going to be reprogrammed you
[1:36:54] are no longer who you thought you were
[1:36:57] all the years of your life now you can
[1:36:58] just forget about there'll be a distant
[1:37:00] fairy tale memory just erase them out of
[1:37:03] your mind your tradition your culture
[1:37:05] your God your language your name
[1:37:08] everything about you is all new you are
[1:37:11] now a
[1:37:12] Chalan just amazing to think about how
[1:37:15] they had to do that but verse eight but
[1:37:17] Daniel purposed in his heart he didn't
[1:37:20] just speak did he he purposed in his
[1:37:24] heart that he would not defile himself
[1:37:27] with the portion of the king's meat nor
[1:37:29] with the wine which he
[1:37:31] drank therefore he requested of the
[1:37:34] prince of the Unix that he might not
[1:37:37] defile himself he stood out he was
[1:37:40] willing to say I I I don't actually
[1:37:43] agree with that I I'm a Christian I I'm
[1:37:46] a Believer I I just can't go for what
[1:37:48] you're talking about here and and and I
[1:37:51] just can't defile myself with it and I'm
[1:37:52] not willing to do that I say Lord help
[1:37:55] me have that kind of courage to stand
[1:37:57] out because we know that his word says
[1:38:00] that if we will actually stand for him
[1:38:02] here oh my he's going to stand for us
[1:38:05] there but if we just don't stand for him
[1:38:07] here if we're afraid to do that then
[1:38:09] he's not going to stand for us
[1:38:12] there verse
[1:38:14] n this is just so beautiful this is
[1:38:16] where it gets into God's will is his
[1:38:18] word this is this is where it starts to
[1:38:20] get down to the rubber spinning on thead
[1:38:22] the the rubber spinning on the wrote
[1:38:23] here now God had brought Daniel into
[1:38:26] favor Daniel didn't bring himself into
[1:38:29] favor the brothers might have thought
[1:38:31] wow that Daniel sure got a skill to
[1:38:33] bring himself into favor with people no
[1:38:37] God brought Daniel into favor and tender
[1:38:40] love with the prince of the Unix I can
[1:38:44] only help but imagine that's because he
[1:38:45] had the life of Jesus Christ Living out
[1:38:48] through him now we know the Holy Ghost
[1:38:49] hadn't yet come but there were some
[1:38:51] people who believed and we know that
[1:38:53] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:38:55] today and forever and there was
[1:38:56] something in him that was constraining
[1:38:58] him to not defile himself with the
[1:39:01] pollutants of the land right but it was
[1:39:04] with tender love the prince of the Unix
[1:39:07] looked upon
[1:39:09] Daniel verse 10 says the prince of the
[1:39:11] unic said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the
[1:39:13] king who hath appointed your meat and
[1:39:16] your drink for why should he see your
[1:39:19] faces worse liking than the children
[1:39:23] with which are of your sort the other I
[1:39:27] don't know what the number would be left
[1:39:29] over of the
[1:39:31] 4600 then shall ye make me in danger my
[1:39:35] head to the king he knew where he stood
[1:39:38] and you know this King Nebuchadnezzar he
[1:39:39] didn't fool around did he if you if you
[1:39:42] disobeyed him if you crossed him that's
[1:39:44] it you're done goodbye we're not going
[1:39:46] to have a discussion there's not going
[1:39:48] to be a a big debate and and open a
[1:39:50] dialogue and see whether we can actually
[1:39:52] come to a an aable agreement you're
[1:39:55] going to listen to me the king or you're
[1:39:57] going to die that's all that's the way
[1:39:59] Nebuchadnezzar rolled so his his guard
[1:40:02] his Chamberlain he knew exactly where he
[1:40:04] stood he's nervous now this guy is
[1:40:07] saying I don't want you to do what the
[1:40:08] king said I want you to do what I said
[1:40:10] you can imagine the predicament that he
[1:40:12] was in he really did fear for his head
[1:40:15] then said Daniel to melzar who the
[1:40:17] prince of the Unix had said over Daniel
[1:40:19] haniah mishel and Azariah and isn't it
[1:40:22] beautiful the word word of God doesn't
[1:40:24] address them as Shadrach Meshach and
[1:40:27] Abednego the Chaldeans address them as
[1:40:30] that the word of God addresses them by
[1:40:32] their real
[1:40:34] names he says prove thy servants I
[1:40:37] beseech thee verse 12 10 days and let
[1:40:39] them give us pulse to eat and water to
[1:40:41] drink then let our countenances be
[1:40:43] looked upon before thee and the
[1:40:46] countenance of the children that eat of
[1:40:48] the portion of the king's meat and as
[1:40:51] thou seest deal with thy servants just a
[1:40:55] beautiful testimony isn't it for him to
[1:40:58] even have the courage to speak those
[1:40:59] words what is it that caused him to do
[1:41:02] it somehow some way I I can only imagine
[1:41:06] the seed Gene of God inside of him was
[1:41:09] quick to the word of God and he just had
[1:41:11] a desire to say I'm willing to serve God
[1:41:13] and no
[1:41:16] man verse 14 so he consented to them in
[1:41:21] this matter and proved them 10 days
[1:41:24] but imagine brothers and
[1:41:26] sisters if he would have had a boastful
[1:41:29] attitude if Daniel would have had a
[1:41:31] prideful
[1:41:32] attitude if if Daniel would have
[1:41:34] actually lifted himself up and and
[1:41:37] started to maybe puff his shoulders out
[1:41:39] and say that I'm of the lineage of Judah
[1:41:43] and this is a filthy land if he would
[1:41:46] have maybe not even spoke a word but
[1:41:48] just his countenance just his
[1:41:51] actions that speak so much louder than
[1:41:53] words if that was his behavior what
[1:41:56] would the people have perceived him like
[1:41:57] would he have actually found favor and
[1:42:00] tender love with the prince of the
[1:42:03] Unix he must have had a different spirit
[1:42:06] in his
[1:42:07] life but he said prove th prove thy
[1:42:10] servants let's see what happened so
[1:42:12] verse 14 so he consented to them in this
[1:42:15] matter and proved them 10 days verse 15
[1:42:18] at the end of the 10 days their
[1:42:19] countenances appeared fairer and fatter
[1:42:22] in flesh than all the children which did
[1:42:25] eat of the portion of the king's meat so
[1:42:27] I I just took a little time and looked
[1:42:29] this up I'm just going to throw it out
[1:42:30] there if anybody wants to you can look
[1:42:31] up what the Chalan diet was and and they
[1:42:34] like to eat all manner of Beast so it's
[1:42:37] interesting Beef Pork you know didn't
[1:42:39] matter they they like to eat it all so
[1:42:41] you could just imagine a nice marbling
[1:42:44] ribeye or or a Porter House steak a real
[1:42:46] big thick Tomahawk all that fatty
[1:42:49] goodness in that steak right they should
[1:42:52] have actually been putting on fat right
[1:42:54] drinking the wine maybe even a bit of
[1:42:56] gout in those boys right but you know
[1:43:00] maybe they were looking out for their
[1:43:02] brothers and their sisters so he
[1:43:04] consented to them in this matter and
[1:43:06] proved them 10 days verse 15 at the end
[1:43:09] of the 10 days their countenances
[1:43:10] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than
[1:43:12] all the children which did eat of the
[1:43:14] portion of the king's meat they were
[1:43:15] actually not defying themselves they
[1:43:17] were following the will of the Lord no
[1:43:20] matter what the circumstance just like
[1:43:22] Joseph even though he was was in the
[1:43:23] bottom of the pit he didn't stop
[1:43:24] worshiping God even though he was a
[1:43:27] slave he didn't stop worshiping
[1:43:32] God thus I just think this is so good so
[1:43:36] good verse 16 thus melzar the prince of
[1:43:40] the Unix took away all of the portion of
[1:43:43] their meat all the other naughty
[1:43:46] brothers and sisters now they all got to
[1:43:49] eat pulse for misbehaving
[1:43:53] thus melzar took away the portion of
[1:43:55] their meat and wine that they should
[1:43:57] drink and gave them pulse and as for
[1:44:00] these four children God gave them
[1:44:02] knowledge and skill and all learning and
[1:44:04] wisdom and Daniel had understanding and
[1:44:06] all visions and
[1:44:08] dreams now at the end of the days that
[1:44:11] the king had said he should bring them
[1:44:13] in then the prince of the Unix brought
[1:44:16] them in before Nebuchadnezzar you can
[1:44:19] only imagine brothers and sisters what
[1:44:21] this would be like to go in before the
[1:44:24] King Nebuchadnezzar there's a lot of
[1:44:26] Kings we can imagine jeak Kim wasn't
[1:44:29] nothing like this guy jeim was a he he
[1:44:32] he had a wishbone he never had a
[1:44:34] backbone that's what brother Ram would
[1:44:36] say I don't think he said that
[1:44:37] necessarily about him but he wasn't
[1:44:39] willing to stand for the word of God but
[1:44:40] at least this King Nebuchadnezzar stood
[1:44:42] for something he had he had he had a a
[1:44:45] constitution and he wasn't interested in
[1:44:47] anybody's opinion about it he did what
[1:44:50] he wanted to do as the king he led verse
[1:44:53] vers 19 and the king communed with them
[1:44:55] and among them all was found none like
[1:45:00] Daniel hananiah Michel and Azariah
[1:45:05] therefore stood they before the
[1:45:09] king I can only imagine it would have
[1:45:11] been a nerve-wracking thing for them but
[1:45:13] they had courage they knew they were
[1:45:15] willing to put God before
[1:45:19] everything and in all matters of wisdom
[1:45:22] and understanding
[1:45:23] that the king inquired of them he found
[1:45:25] them 10 times better than all the
[1:45:29] magicians and astrologers that were in
[1:45:33] all his
[1:45:34] realm and Daniel continued even until
[1:45:37] the first year of King
[1:45:39] Cyrus and we know that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:45:41] passed away and Cyrus took
[1:45:44] over um we won't get too far into that I
[1:45:47] just want to continue with the thought
[1:45:50] that his will is his word and as they
[1:45:52] kept his word in front of them and were
[1:45:55] not willing to compromise God continued
[1:45:57] to bless them and it didn't matter what
[1:45:59] the circumstance was we know the story
[1:46:01] all all too
[1:46:03] well but I think it's just a an
[1:46:05] absolutely wonderful thing you know
[1:46:07] brothers and sisters if they would have
[1:46:09] said even to the king's Chamberlain you
[1:46:12] know we don't like this position we we
[1:46:14] want to change maybe our garments we
[1:46:16] want to do something different they
[1:46:18] never said anything about their garments
[1:46:19] it was just the food that was the only
[1:46:21] thing that was defiling them and and
[1:46:22] they they said okay this is the one
[1:46:24] thing that we can't actually compromise
[1:46:26] on can we actually do something about
[1:46:28] this and and we know the king's
[1:46:30] Chamberlain he actually helped them with
[1:46:32] that but you know it just made me think
[1:46:35] about the Chamberlain and and what what
[1:46:37] importance it is for the Chamberlain we
[1:46:39] need to know what the king likes and the
[1:46:42] only way we're going to know what the
[1:46:43] king likes is to listen to his
[1:46:45] Chamberlain and we know in our day we've
[1:46:48] had a Chamberlain and that is the
[1:46:49] Prophet The Prophet has come and given
[1:46:52] us a word and that word is the word of
[1:46:54] God and as we take that word and begin
[1:46:56] to bathe oursel in that word we're
[1:46:59] always going to be in his will brothers
[1:47:01] and sisters there's times where we might
[1:47:03] Bounce Around the ship we might fall on
[1:47:05] our head you know we can be up and down
[1:47:07] and all around but we're still in the
[1:47:10] ship don't don't worry you're never
[1:47:13] going to fall out that's not the the
[1:47:16] prophecy for us in our day but you know
[1:47:19] just like Ruth she
[1:47:20] recognized for a little while
[1:47:23] months of time just listen to what the
[1:47:26] Chamberlain says because he's going to
[1:47:28] give you the provision that the king
[1:47:30] likes and we know that's what she did
[1:47:33] and we know that that's what these
[1:47:35] children of Israel did with one thing
[1:47:37] they just said I'm not going to actually
[1:47:39] compromise on this one thing you know
[1:47:42] we're talking about Daniel how he is h a
[1:47:45] good example of being in God's will no
[1:47:48] matter where he goes and no matter what
[1:47:50] he does and some might say you know he
[1:47:52] was born to actually be in that position
[1:47:54] I want to say this if you're the Bride
[1:47:55] of Jesus Christ you too were born to be
[1:47:58] in that position to not be out of the
[1:48:00] will of God to be in the will of God
[1:48:01] brothers and sisters someone has to
[1:48:03] fulfill that portion of
[1:48:07] scripture you know we know Daniel was a
[1:48:10] a revealer of Secrets and uh I think
[1:48:13] it's just
[1:48:15] beautiful how Daniel had the ability to
[1:48:19] actually identify
[1:48:23] things we know carrying on in Chapter 2
[1:48:26] for time sake I'm not going to
[1:48:29] uh oh we might as well we better chapter
[1:48:32] 2 verse one and in the second year of
[1:48:34] the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:48:36] Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams where with
[1:48:38] his Spirit was troubled and his sleep
[1:48:40] break from him then the king commanded
[1:48:43] to all call the M magicians and the
[1:48:46] astrologers and the sorcerers and the
[1:48:48] Chalan for to show the king his dreams
[1:48:51] so they came and stood before the king
[1:48:54] and the King said unto them I have
[1:48:56] dreamed a dream on my and my spirit was
[1:48:59] troubled to know the
[1:49:01] dream and it's interesting how this this
[1:49:04] story goes it's it's it's just the Lord
[1:49:07] isn't it how he orchestrates things how
[1:49:09] he allows things to come to pass to
[1:49:12] fulfill his word then spake the
[1:49:14] Chaldeans to the king in syak oh King
[1:49:17] live forever tell thy servants the dream
[1:49:20] and we will show the interpretation
[1:49:23] the king answered and said to the Chans
[1:49:26] the thing is gone for me if ye will not
[1:49:30] make known unto me the dream with the
[1:49:33] interpretation thereof ye shall be cut
[1:49:36] in pieces and your houses shall be made
[1:49:39] a
[1:49:40] dungill that King never messed
[1:49:43] around you can imagine he's like I've
[1:49:45] paid you probably for decades to be in
[1:49:47] my court and to tell me what I want to
[1:49:49] hear and now I want to know the
[1:49:51] interpretation of this dream
[1:49:53] and you're going to tell me it and if
[1:49:54] you're not going to then you're no good
[1:49:56] to
[1:49:58] me terrible to think though that you'll
[1:50:00] be cut in pieces and your houses shall
[1:50:02] be made a dungill but if you show the
[1:50:04] dream and the interpretation thereof ye
[1:50:07] shall receive of me gifts and rewards
[1:50:11] and great
[1:50:13] honor therefore show me the dream and
[1:50:17] the interpretation thereof interesting
[1:50:20] how terrible one hand is and how
[1:50:23] dramatically wonderful the other hand is
[1:50:27] and all they had to do was show the
[1:50:29] dream and then give the interpretation
[1:50:31] of it this is God setting this up this
[1:50:34] is not by accident brothers and sisters
[1:50:36] that this just sort of happened they
[1:50:38] answered again and said let the king
[1:50:40] tell his servants the dream and we will
[1:50:42] show the interpretation of it the king
[1:50:44] answered and said I know of certainty
[1:50:46] that ye would gain the time because ye
[1:50:49] see the thing is gone from me but if ye
[1:50:51] will not make known un to me the dream
[1:50:53] there is but one decree for you for ye
[1:50:56] have prepared lying and corrupt words to
[1:50:59] speak before me till the time be changed
[1:51:01] therefore tell me the dream and I shall
[1:51:03] know that you can show me the
[1:51:05] interpretation
[1:51:08] thereof just
[1:51:10] amazing because who can do that there's
[1:51:13] one and it ain't
[1:51:16] Daniel the Chaldeans answered before the
[1:51:18] king and said there is not a man upon
[1:51:20] the Earth that can show the Kings
[1:51:23] matter
[1:51:25] therefore there is no King no Lord no
[1:51:29] ruler that asked such things at any
[1:51:34] magician or astrologer or Chalan made me
[1:51:36] think about when I was reading this and
[1:51:38] I wonder if brother Bram talks about it
[1:51:40] somewhere maybe I heard somebody say it
[1:51:41] somewhere along the way that these must
[1:51:43] have been professional astrologers
[1:51:45] professional magicians and how they they
[1:51:48] they must have potentially gone from
[1:51:50] King to King and ruler to ruler and just
[1:51:53] had their bag of tricks that they took
[1:51:55] with them along the way and we know that
[1:51:58] people can learn to do little magic
[1:52:00] tricks along the way and likely that's
[1:52:02] what they were doing and maybe tapping
[1:52:04] into more but this is one thing that God
[1:52:06] would not allow to have used by The
[1:52:09] Magicians or the astrologers no man
[1:52:12] could tell the interpretation of a dream
[1:52:14] or tell the dream for that
[1:52:16] matter verse 11 and it's a rare thing
[1:52:19] that the king requireth and there is
[1:52:21] none other that can show it before the
[1:52:23] king except the gods whose dwelling is
[1:52:27] not with
[1:52:30] flesh excuse
[1:52:33] me verse 12 for this cause the King was
[1:52:35] angry and Furious and commanded to
[1:52:37] destroy all the wise men of Babylon
[1:52:40] that's it we're done get them out of
[1:52:42] here they're a waste of my time waste of
[1:52:45] my finances I've been paying them too
[1:52:47] long for
[1:52:48] nothing and the decree went forth that
[1:52:51] the wise men should be slain and they
[1:52:54] sought Daniel and his fellows to be
[1:52:57] slain then Daniel answered with counsel
[1:53:00] and wisdom to aroch the captain of the
[1:53:03] King's Guard which was gone forth to
[1:53:05] slay the wise men of
[1:53:07] Babylon and he just answered with wisdom
[1:53:10] didn't he he answered and said arok the
[1:53:14] king's Captain why is the decree so
[1:53:17] Hasty from the King then arok made the
[1:53:20] thing known to Daniel then Daniel went
[1:53:22] in and desired of the king that he would
[1:53:24] give him a time that he would show the
[1:53:27] king the interpretation then Daniel went
[1:53:29] to his house and made the thing known to
[1:53:31] haniah mishel and Azariah his companions
[1:53:35] that they would desire mercies of
[1:53:37] God of Heaven concerning this secret
[1:53:41] that Daniel and his fellows should not
[1:53:43] perish with the rest of the wise men of
[1:53:46] Babylon I just can't help but think
[1:53:48] brothers and sisters there's times in
[1:53:49] our lives where we need to gather
[1:53:51] together with our brother brothers and
[1:53:52] our sisters hey and do exactly what
[1:53:55] Daniel did and and and desire the
[1:53:58] mercies of God of Heaven concerning the
[1:54:01] matter that comes up and you know that
[1:54:04] happens in the form of prayer meetings
[1:54:06] that happens in the form of of
[1:54:08] fellowships that happens in the form of
[1:54:10] church services that's the reason we
[1:54:12] gather together so that the god of
[1:54:14] Heaven would deal with us concerning
[1:54:17] things in our lives that we don't have
[1:54:18] the answers
[1:54:20] for verse 19 then was the secret
[1:54:23] revealed unto Daniel in a night
[1:54:26] vision what did Daniel want to do he
[1:54:29] didn't want to talk to the Chans he
[1:54:30] didn't want to go and read the horoscope
[1:54:32] he didn't want to go and look on Google
[1:54:35] what he wanted to do was seek the god of
[1:54:37] Heaven seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:54:41] and then all of these things shall be
[1:54:43] added unto you then Daniel was the
[1:54:46] secret then was the secret revealed unto
[1:54:48] Daniel in a night vision then Daniel
[1:54:51] blessed the god of Heaven said Thank You
[1:54:53] Lord thank you Lord I knew that you
[1:54:55] would show me I know that you're a
[1:54:57] living God verse 20 Daniel answered and
[1:55:00] said blessed be the name of God forever
[1:55:03] and ever for wisdom and might are his
[1:55:05] and he changeth the times and the
[1:55:06] seasons and removeth kings and sth up
[1:55:09] Kings and giveth wisdom unto the wise
[1:55:11] and knowledge to them that know
[1:55:15] understanding giving it all back to God
[1:55:17] if we've got anything in our life it's
[1:55:19] because he gave it to us not because we
[1:55:21] did it we can go and say that we have a
[1:55:24] University degree but it's only because
[1:55:26] God gave us the ability to do
[1:55:29] it and maybe parents to pay for it or
[1:55:33] the ability to get a
[1:55:34] loan verse 22 he revealeth the deep and
[1:55:40] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[1:55:44] darkness and the light dwelleth in
[1:55:47] him I thank thee and praise thee Oh thou
[1:55:50] God of my fathers who H has given me
[1:55:53] wisdom and might and H has made known
[1:55:55] unto me now what we desired of thee for
[1:55:59] thou Hast made now made known unto us
[1:56:04] the king's
[1:56:05] matter isn't it interesting brothers and
[1:56:08] sisters I can only
[1:56:10] imagine that as he was speaking those
[1:56:13] words that he wasn't just saying oh Lord
[1:56:16] God
[1:56:17] now blessed be thy name I can imagine
[1:56:21] that he wasn't chanting like a
[1:56:24] monk in a monotone fashion over and over
[1:56:28] the same way on and on I can only
[1:56:32] imagine that he was worshiping these
[1:56:34] words to God because his life was
[1:56:36] required if he didn't come up with an
[1:56:38] answer and the lives of everyone else
[1:56:40] and I can only imagine that in his life
[1:56:42] he wasn't even so concerned about his
[1:56:43] life he was concerned about the
[1:56:46] 4500 other people whose lives came out
[1:56:50] of Israel with him
[1:56:53] everyone was depending on
[1:56:55] this even the
[1:56:58] soothsayers and the M magicians but here
[1:57:01] we have Daniel in his position knowing
[1:57:04] that there's no way that he would ever
[1:57:06] be able to do this on his own verse 24
[1:57:09] therefore Daniel went in unto arok who
[1:57:13] whom the king had ordained to destroy
[1:57:15] the wise men of Babylon can you imagine
[1:57:18] the courage to walk in and be able to
[1:57:20] say he went in and said thus unto him
[1:57:23] destroy not the wise men of Babylon
[1:57:25] bring me in before the King and I will
[1:57:28] show unto the king the interpretation
[1:57:31] thereof
[1:57:33] my my my
[1:57:36] my then arok brought in Daniel before
[1:57:38] the king in haste and said thus unto him
[1:57:41] I have found a man of the captives of
[1:57:43] Judah that will make known unto the king
[1:57:46] the interpretation and the King answered
[1:57:49] and said to Daniel whose name was Bel
[1:57:52] Bel shazar artart thou able to make
[1:57:54] known unto me the dream which I have
[1:57:57] seen and the interpretation
[1:57:59] thereof Daniel answered in the presence
[1:58:02] of the king and said the secret which
[1:58:06] the king hath demanded cannot the wise
[1:58:09] men the
[1:58:11] astrologers The Magicians the
[1:58:13] soothsayers show The
[1:58:15] King but there is a God in
[1:58:17] heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh
[1:58:22] known to the King
[1:58:24] Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
[1:58:26] latter days thy dream and the visions of
[1:58:31] thy Head Upon thy bed are these and we
[1:58:36] know that he gives the interpretation of
[1:58:38] it and and it's just amazing because
[1:58:41] it's the image the image that he creates
[1:58:44] and uh we'll get into that in a minute
[1:58:46] it just made me think about the story in
[1:58:48] 2 Kings verse 6 we know
[1:58:52] this story very well this is about
[1:58:55] Elisha and his servant and how the
[1:58:58] syrians were after them the syrians
[1:59:00] wanted to get this guy real bad and why
[1:59:03] did they want to get him because there
[1:59:05] was something about him that was able to
[1:59:07] discuss the secrets from his bed chamber
[1:59:11] the military plans that were happening
[1:59:14] in Syria were being leaked they were
[1:59:17] being leaked and the King was like how
[1:59:20] are we going to find who's who is for
[1:59:22] Israel in the land let's read it in 2
[1:59:24] Kings verse 6 here I I'll just read it
[1:59:26] quickly for time sake and one of his
[1:59:29] servants said none my Lord oh King but
[1:59:31] Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tth
[1:59:34] the king of Israel the words that thou
[1:59:36] speakest in thy bed
[1:59:38] chamber and he said go and spy where he
[1:59:41] is that I may send and fetch him and it
[1:59:43] was told him saying behold he's in
[1:59:45] Dothan therefore sent he tether horses
[1:59:48] and chariots and great host and they
[1:59:50] came by night and come the city about
[1:59:53] and when the servant of the man of God
[1:59:54] was risen early and gone forth Behold a
[1:59:57] host encompassed the city both with
[1:59:59] horses and chariots and his servant said
[2:00:00] unto him alas Master how shall we do
[2:00:04] many times in our lives brothers and
[2:00:05] sisters we will be living in the will of
[2:00:08] God and we will be Discerning because
[2:00:10] that will is his word and the word is
[2:00:13] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[2:00:16] two-edged sword and many times we could
[2:00:17] have a conversation and be Discerning
[2:00:20] the heart of the person we're talking to
[2:00:22] and not even recognize it but the person
[2:00:25] who's being spoken to does because they
[2:00:28] know there's no way that person could
[2:00:31] understand what they're talking about
[2:00:32] how do they know it and that's why we
[2:00:34] need to make a decision if we ever hear
[2:00:36] it come across a Pulpit if we ever have
[2:00:38] it in a conversation now is somebody
[2:00:40] socializing and discussing my life they
[2:00:42] know my secret so they're talking about
[2:00:44] it is somebody leaking the the secrets
[2:00:47] that I talk about in my bed chamber to
[2:00:49] other people in the congregation or is
[2:00:51] it God
[2:00:52] that's where we have to make the
[2:00:53] decision brothers and sisters I want to
[2:00:55] tell you if God's speaking just say Amen
[2:00:58] to the
[2:01:00] word if there is a brother and a sister
[2:01:02] that's busy gossiping that's going to be
[2:01:05] on their head that's going to be on
[2:01:06] their shoulders to take we don't have to
[2:01:09] participate we know God hates gossip am
[2:01:13] he doesn't just dislike it he hates
[2:01:15] it in Hebrews 4 for the word of God is
[2:01:19] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[2:01:20] two-edged sword Pierce in even to the
[2:01:22] dividing aund of Soul and Spirit and to
[2:01:25] the joints and Marrow and is a discerner
[2:01:27] and the thoughts and the intents of the
[2:01:29] heart this is the spirit of God that
[2:01:31] will live out through real
[2:01:33] Believers it's not just for a prophet
[2:01:36] it's not just for a minister it's for
[2:01:38] children children can actually do this
[2:01:41] children can actually be the word made
[2:01:45] flesh in our
[2:01:46] day neither is there any creature that's
[2:01:49] not manifest in his sight but all things
[2:01:51] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[2:01:55] with whom we have to do I just think
[2:01:58] it's so beautiful seeing that we have a
[2:01:59] a great high priest that's passed into
[2:02:01] the heavens Jesus the son of God let us
[2:02:03] hold fast our profession let's not
[2:02:09] waver why brothers and sisters because
[2:02:11] it's later than we
[2:02:13] think you know um taking a look at just
[2:02:18] the idea of it being later than we think
[2:02:23] we know very well that in the end of the
[2:02:25] third chapter of Revelation the church
[2:02:27] goes up and that's what we're looking
[2:02:29] for just like John when he saw that door
[2:02:32] open in Heaven There was a a higher
[2:02:34] Revelation and he saw that door open and
[2:02:36] immediately he was in the spirit on the
[2:02:38] Lord's day that's exactly where we're at
[2:02:40] today but the prophetic utterance isn't
[2:02:43] something that we can actually just
[2:02:45] dismiss and uh I can see that we're not
[2:02:47] going to get all the way that I want to
[2:02:49] with this uh discussion in Daniel so
[2:02:52] we'll get into the image I think next
[2:02:54] week but you know that the bride when
[2:02:56] she goes up at the end of Revelations 3
[2:02:59] she does not return again
[2:03:01] until Christ comes
[2:03:04] again and see Christ isn't
[2:03:08] coming he's
[2:03:10] going Christ is here now brother bradam
[2:03:12] declared it openly he said he's here and
[2:03:15] and Christ is either Christ or he's not
[2:03:18] Christ and he said he's here when he was
[2:03:21] here on Earth so now the bride's still
[2:03:25] here on Earth so where is Christ
[2:03:27] today the bride is going to go and meet
[2:03:29] with him in the air we're going to go
[2:03:32] and meet with him in the clouds we're
[2:03:33] not going to meet with him walking on
[2:03:34] the street here we're not going to see a
[2:03:37] 60-foot Jesus we're not going to see the
[2:03:38] banisters of Heaven open we're not going
[2:03:40] to see Planes Trains and Automobiles
[2:03:41] it's going to be this secret sudden
[2:03:43] going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:45] The Whole World's just going to carry on
[2:03:46] brother bradam said they'll keep on
[2:03:47] preaching they'll keep on baptizing
[2:03:49] people will keep coming in thinking
[2:03:51] they're getting saved and the Rapture
[2:03:52] will already be gone I say Lord help us
[2:03:55] get in line with your word and be
[2:03:59] ready but the church doesn't return to
[2:04:03] the Earth Christ doesn't come back to
[2:04:06] the Earth again until Revelations 19
[2:04:07] with his bride and and the whole idea
[2:04:11] about predestination can cause confusion
[2:04:14] there's people that are predestinated to
[2:04:16] go in the Rapture and there's PR people
[2:04:18] that are predestinated not to it's that
[2:04:21] the law of el ction might stand we can't
[2:04:23] put anybody in but I I certainly hope
[2:04:25] that we're not trying to put anybody out
[2:04:28] we want to take as many people with us
[2:04:29] as we
[2:04:31] can but you know this whole idea of
[2:04:33] predestination it makes people think
[2:04:35] that there's no control over our lives
[2:04:39] but we have free moral
[2:04:41] agency and God's prophetic utterance
[2:04:43] will always come to pass brothers and
[2:04:45] sisters we don't have to worry it will
[2:04:48] always come to come to pass
[2:04:52] and uh I I just was thinking about this
[2:04:54] and this is maybe why I'm going this way
[2:04:55] is maybe just a a pause in the
[2:04:58] discussion about this but to recognize
[2:05:00] that Daniel he was a prophet and and he
[2:05:02] was able to bring interpretation of
[2:05:05] Dreams he was able to understand the
[2:05:07] secrets the dark things the Deep things
[2:05:10] God gave him some way of being able to
[2:05:14] do this and and it was a prophetic
[2:05:15] utterance that came through and we know
[2:05:18] that the the prophetic utterance will
[2:05:20] always come to pass there's no way that
[2:05:21] we can stop it and we know that Satan
[2:05:23] recognizes there's no way that he can
[2:05:25] stop it either and you know I had talked
[2:05:27] about this in the past how I heard this
[2:05:29] other minister say that you know when uh
[2:05:31] three and a half years happens when
[2:05:32] Satan actually sees the bride in glory
[2:05:34] and recognizes that she's come up now
[2:05:36] he's cast down he's got three and a half
[2:05:38] years to get his business done all that
[2:05:40] he ever has left over to do and how
[2:05:43] Wicked and terrible that time is going
[2:05:45] to be you know brothers and sisters
[2:05:47] greater is he that is in Me Greater is
[2:05:49] he that is in us than he that is is in
[2:05:51] this world right now there's coming a
[2:05:54] time though where the we don't want to
[2:05:56] be here we know Satan recognizes the
[2:05:59] prophetic utterance and that's why
[2:06:01] there's such a persecution against the
[2:06:03] church today even against this message
[2:06:05] of the hour but you know this prophetic
[2:06:06] utterance that we're talking about
[2:06:07] brothers and sisters it's God's Own
[2:06:09] voice and it started back in the Garden
[2:06:10] of Eden back in Genesis 3 and and we
[2:06:13] know that God when he was handing out
[2:06:16] the curses because of Disobedience
[2:06:18] because they step out of their will
[2:06:22] God's will Adam stepped out of it what
[2:06:24] happened was God gave the curses and
[2:06:27] verse 14 of Genesis chter 3 and the Lord
[2:06:29] God said unto the serpent because thou
[2:06:31] Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all
[2:06:33] the cattle above every beast of the
[2:06:35] field upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[2:06:37] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[2:06:40] life and I will put emnity between thee
[2:06:43] and the woman and between thy seed and
[2:06:45] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[2:06:49] but Thou shalt bruise his heel and we
[2:06:50] know this was a prophetic utterance and
[2:06:53] it wasn't through a prophet was it it
[2:06:56] started in the Garden of Eden and it was
[2:06:57] God's Own voice I just thought that was
[2:07:00] powerful thinking about it his own voice
[2:07:03] describing what's going to happen amen
[2:07:06] there is a seed of The Serpent and there
[2:07:09] is a seed of the woman and we know that
[2:07:12] he talked about the seed of the woman
[2:07:14] being Jesus Christ and the seed of the
[2:07:16] serpent being the Antichrist spirit that
[2:07:18] would be the devil come and actually
[2:07:22] bruise the heel of the Bride of her seed
[2:07:27] we know that was Jesus but Jesus what
[2:07:29] did he do he stomped on the head of that
[2:07:32] Serpent and we know that he killed him
[2:07:34] he dealt a death blow to Satan right
[2:07:37] there at Calvary and if that would have
[2:07:40] been the case if Satan would have been
[2:07:41] able to recognize that he never would
[2:07:42] have allowed it to happen he would have
[2:07:44] done everything that he could to
[2:07:45] actually stop that but we know God is
[2:07:48] God you're never going to outsmart God
[2:07:51] never
[2:07:52] even though Satan thought he
[2:07:54] could we know that it was it's an
[2:07:56] interesting point to make that it was
[2:08:00] after God formed Man Out of the Dust of
[2:08:02] the earth that he went from being just
[2:08:06] God created and God created and God
[2:08:09] created it was after God formed Man Out
[2:08:12] of the Dust of the earth breathed into
[2:08:13] his nostrils he became a living soul
[2:08:15] that he became Lord God an object of
[2:08:19] worship he was able to worship Him
[2:08:22] we know it goes on far farther and
[2:08:24] farther Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord
[2:08:27] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[2:08:28] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[2:08:30] shall call his name Emanuel God With Us
[2:08:32] God prophesied I will give you an
[2:08:35] everlasting sign Isaiah
[2:08:38] 55 maybe just turn there with me as we
[2:08:41] close today I'll pick up from here next
[2:08:44] week Lord
[2:08:46] willing I know it's a real big deviation
[2:08:49] but I just felt it was important
[2:08:52] Isaiah 55
[2:08:57] verse1 prophecy very applicable to the
[2:09:00] bride to everyone who believes in the
[2:09:04] Lord Isaiah 55:1 ho everyone that
[2:09:08] thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he
[2:09:12] that hath no money Come Ye and buy and
[2:09:15] eat yay come buy wine and milk without
[2:09:19] money and without price wherefore do ye
[2:09:23] spend money for that which is not bread
[2:09:26] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[2:09:29] not hearken diligently unto me and eat
[2:09:33] ye that which is good and let your soul
[2:09:36] Delight itself in fatness I just can't
[2:09:40] help but rejoice when I read these words
[2:09:42] because this is the Lord God speaking
[2:09:44] through the prophet he that hath an ear
[2:09:46] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[2:09:49] unto the church when we read these words
[2:09:51] words he says incline your ear and come
[2:09:53] unto me hear and your soul shall live
[2:09:57] and I will make an Everlasting Covenant
[2:09:59] with who with you even the sure mercies
[2:10:04] of David behold I have given him for a
[2:10:07] witness to the people a leader and
[2:10:09] Commander to the people behold Thou
[2:10:11] shalt call a nation that thou knowest
[2:10:14] not and Nations that knew not thee shall
[2:10:17] run unto thee because of the Lord thy
[2:10:20] God and and for the Holy One of Israel
[2:10:23] for he hath glorified thee seek ye the
[2:10:27] Lord while he may be found call ye upon
[2:10:32] him while he is near let the wicked
[2:10:35] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[2:10:38] his thoughts and let him return unto the
[2:10:41] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[2:10:44] to our God for he will abundantly
[2:10:49] pardon for my thoughts are not your
[2:10:51] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[2:10:55] saith the Lord for as the heavens are
[2:10:57] higher than the earth so are my ways
[2:10:59] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[2:11:01] than your thoughts for as the rain
[2:11:03] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[2:11:05] returneth not tither but WTH the Earth
[2:11:08] and maketh it bring forth and Bud that
[2:11:11] it might give seed to the swer and bread
[2:11:13] to the eater so shall my word be that
[2:11:17] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[2:11:21] return unto me void but it shall
[2:11:24] accomplish that which I please and it
[2:11:27] shall prosper in the thing where to I
[2:11:30] sent it for ye shall go out with joy and
[2:11:33] be led forth with peace and the
[2:11:35] mountains and the hills shall Break
[2:11:37] Forth before you into singing and all
[2:11:40] the trees of the field shall clap their
[2:11:42] hands instead of the thorn shall come up
[2:11:45] the fur tree instead of the Brier shall
[2:11:48] come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be
[2:11:50] to the Lord for an Everlast for a name
[2:11:53] for an everlasting sign that shall not
[2:11:56] be cut
[2:11:58] off God bless you this morning I'll just
[2:12:00] ask the musicians to come as we close
[2:12:04] here brothers and sisters the reason
[2:12:07] that we're
[2:12:08] here is because God came in flesh to be
[2:12:11] our kinsman redeemer that's the reason
[2:12:13] we're here this morning being able to
[2:12:15] gather around this
[2:12:17] word he came to bruise the head of the
[2:12:20] serpent
[2:12:21] and it's so beautiful because it was
[2:12:23] with a deadly wound and what happened
[2:12:25] was that showed Satan that deadly wound
[2:12:28] is coming for him he heard this prophecy
[2:12:30] he knew this prophecy was coming from
[2:12:31] the Garden of Eden he knew this prophecy
[2:12:33] was coming and what did it do it bruised
[2:12:35] his head permanently and there's no
[2:12:38] recovering from it and he knows for sure
[2:12:41] that there is no Eternity for him he's
[2:12:44] not going to stop trying though he's
[2:12:46] going to keep fighting all the way to
[2:12:48] the very end but that bruise was a
[2:12:51] deadly wound and and it's one that can
[2:12:53] never be healed brothers and
[2:12:55] sisters so maybe stand with me as we
[2:12:57] close here just remember that it's
[2:13:00] nothing that we have
[2:13:03] done it's only so that we could see that
[2:13:06] there is an everlasting
[2:13:08] sign and I think it's just a wonderful
[2:13:10] thought that God provided a lamb for
[2:13:13] each and every one of us if we can
[2:13:15] receive it and as we go through our
[2:13:18] lives don't look at the circumstan aners
[2:13:21] brothers and sisters look to the
[2:13:24] Lord we know that Jonah when he was in
[2:13:27] the whale of the
[2:13:29] belly the belly of the whale that's how
[2:13:33] I feel I'm
[2:13:34] sorry he was in that whale's
[2:13:37] belly alls he could do was look around
[2:13:40] and see belly alls he could smell was
[2:13:44] belly all he could taste was belly but
[2:13:48] we know that what the word says he said
[2:13:52] was I will not count any of this to be
[2:13:55] good or real or valid I will count all
[2:13:58] of this to be lying vanities and what
[2:14:01] I'm going to do is the only thing that I
[2:14:02] know to do is to look toward that Temple
[2:14:05] that we've been instructed to look
[2:14:06] towards and if we're willing to look at
[2:14:07] that Temple then God will save us even
[2:14:11] though we know many times we've heard it
[2:14:13] said that he was a backslidden Christian
[2:14:15] what did Brother badam say he went and
[2:14:18] saved a whole city didn't he
[2:14:22] many times we don't understand our ways
[2:14:23] we don't understand the circumstances or
[2:14:25] the situations just put your trust in
[2:14:28] God brothers and sisters trust in the
[2:14:30] Lord with all of your heart lean not
[2:14:33] unto your own understanding and in all
[2:14:35] of your ways acknowledge Him and he'll
[2:14:37] direct your path God bless you this
[2:14:39] morning let's just bow in prayer
[2:14:42] gracious Heavenly Father
[2:14:43] Lord many times I can't even understand
[2:14:47] why I feel led to go a certain way to
[2:14:50] preach a certain thing thing but I just
[2:14:52] trust you father that Lord we can just
[2:14:54] continually hold your word before all of
[2:14:57] our eyes Lord Jesus and that you will
[2:15:00] direct our path father as we lean upon
[2:15:02] you we know that that's an action it it
[2:15:05] takes effort on our part to lean on you
[2:15:07] to trust on you father but Lord if we
[2:15:10] lean on you and not our own
[2:15:12] understanding then we know that you will
[2:15:13] direct our path father we know that
[2:15:15] you're only obligated to one thing and
[2:15:17] that's your word and there's nothing
[2:15:18] greater for your bride than to remind
[2:15:20] her husband about her word there's
[2:15:22] nothing greater than a child to remind
[2:15:24] their mom or their dad about their word
[2:15:26] and father as your children as your
[2:15:28] bride father we're making ourselves
[2:15:31] ready by taking your word and putting it
[2:15:33] on and we know there's nothing that will
[2:15:35] take us out of here except for your word
[2:15:37] father so help us Lord Jesus to esteem
[2:15:39] your word greater than any one of our
[2:15:42] circumstances than any one of our
[2:15:44] situations in our lives father help us
[2:15:47] to esteem your word greater than any one
[2:15:49] of our thoughts Lord any reasoning that
[2:15:51] could come our
[2:15:53] way Lord we love you and we thank you we
[2:15:56] just want to commit each life into your
[2:15:58] hands as we go our separate ways today

[2:18:22] that song I'll need a little help but I
[2:18:25] really want to sing it and I just want
[2:18:26] to read this one quote here I really
[2:18:28] should have read it before I apologize
[2:18:32] we're going to sing brother Bram out of
[2:18:34] only believe he says I remember when I
[2:18:36] was healed of stomach trouble he Satan
[2:18:39] said why you better not eat said because
[2:18:42] the doctor said if you eat you'll
[2:18:45] die you had an altered stomach and said
[2:18:49] it was just one big bloody Al
[2:18:53] but the Lord said he healed
[2:18:55] me so I had to take somebody's word so I
[2:18:59] took God's
[2:19:01] word I just love the way the prophet
[2:19:03] says this and you know if you listen to
[2:19:06] uh on the wings of a snow white dove he
[2:19:08] talks about this at the end of the
[2:19:09] message but the Lord said he would heal
[2:19:11] me so I had to take somebody's word so I
[2:19:13] took God's word and oh it just burned me
[2:19:16] up it was just hot water running out of
[2:19:19] my mouth and and so two or 3 days I was
[2:19:22] going around holding my stomach like
[2:19:24] this and how are you feeling Mr brandom
[2:19:27] I said I oh I feel fine just tamping
[2:19:30] away like that someone said you lied I
[2:19:34] did not I was making a
[2:19:37] confession confess means say the same
[2:19:41] thing by his stripes I was healed amen
[2:19:45] so that's what it does see I was making
[2:19:48] a
[2:19:49] confession and so Satan said to me said
[2:19:53] you're bringing
[2:19:54] reproach how many has ever encountered

[2:19:59] circumstances situation in your life

[2:20:08] he that is in
[2:20:09] me I said now lookie here old fellow if
[2:20:13] you enjoy hearing me testify you stick
[2:20:16] around but if you don't you might as
[2:20:18] well get away cuz I'm going to testify
[2:20:21] anyhow so that's it you just got to let

[2:20:32] to get to where we know that we're right

[2:20:38] will get to where you're right and then
[2:20:40] you got faith in that you can't have
[2:20:43] faith unless you know you're right don't
[2:20:45] try to do that to Bluff him now he won't
[2:20:47] take your bluff see don't Bluff him but
[2:20:50] when you really believe it you're not
[2:20:52] bluffing then something has already
[2:20:54] witnessed to you and then you know
[2:20:57] you're
[2:21:00] right he says I don't care you might not
[2:21:03] no one ever lay hands on you you might
[2:21:06] not never hear anything but just as long
[2:21:09] as something has confirmed it in your
[2:21:12] heart that it's God's word and God's
[2:21:15] will for you that's all that's
