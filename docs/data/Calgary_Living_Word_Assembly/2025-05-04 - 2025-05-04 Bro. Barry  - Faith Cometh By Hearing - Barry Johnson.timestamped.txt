[40:15] keep to prove your love for
[40:20] me. The
[40:23] voices of a million
[40:27] angels could not
[40:30] express my
[40:35] gratitude. All that I
[40:37] am and ever hope to be.
[40:43] I owe it all. I owe it all to
[40:48] [Music]
[40:50] everyone. To
[40:53] God be the
[40:57] glory. To
[41:00] God be the
[41:04] glory. Oh, to
[41:08] God be the
[41:12] glory for the
[41:15] things he has done. Oh, with his
[41:22] blood he has
[41:25] saved
[41:27] me. With his
[41:30] power he has
[41:33] raised me. Oh to
[41:37] God be the
[41:41] glory for the
[41:44] things he has done.
[41:49] Just let me
[41:53] live my life. Yes Lord. Let it be
[41:59] pleasing
[42:00] Lord to thee.
[42:04] And should I
[42:07] gain any
[42:09] [Music]
[42:11] praise, let it go
[42:16] to with his power. With his
[42:21] power, Lord, he has
[42:24] saved me with his power. with his
[42:29] power. He has
[42:32] raised all to
[42:37] God with the
[42:40] glory for the
[42:43] things he has done. Would you sing the
[42:46] first verse again, brother Faren? That's
[42:48] where pastor comes.
[42:51] How can I say
[42:55] thanks for the
[42:59] things you have done for
[43:03] me.
[43:06] Things so
[43:10] undeserved. Yet you
[43:13] give to prove your love for me.
[43:18] The
[43:20] voices of a million
[43:24] angels could not
[43:27] express my
[43:32] gratitude. Lord, all that I
[43:35] am and ever hope to
[43:39] be, I owe it all. I owe it all to thee.
[43:46] Oh to
[43:50] God the
[43:53] glory. Oh to
[43:55] [Applause]
[43:57] God be the
[44:00] glory. Oh to God.
[44:04] Oh, be the
[44:08] glory for the
[44:10] things he has
[44:15] done. Oh, with his
[44:18] [Music]
[44:26] blood. He
[44:29] has me.
[44:34] [Music]
[44:41] He has done.
[44:46] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[44:48] Welcome to the house of the Lord. If you
[44:51] have a need this morning, maybe just
[44:53] make it known unto him by way of an
[44:54] uplift hand. as we go to him in prayer
[44:58] this morning. We just want to bring a
[45:00] couple of
[45:01] requests. Um, Sister Mario is at home
[45:04] and not feeling well. We just want to
[45:08] ask the Lord to touch her. Amen. As
[45:11] well, we have a prayer request for
[45:13] Traveling Mercy for Sister Emily's mom
[45:16] who is traveling to Toronto tomorrow.
[45:19] She'll be away for two weeks. Two
[45:22] months. Sorry, not two weeks. Two
[45:24] months. And uh if you have a need just
[45:27] let them
[45:28] know. Gracious heavenly father this
[45:30] morning we thank you for your
[45:32] goodness. Thank you for your tender
[45:34] mercies to each and every one of us
[45:37] Lord. Father as we sang Lord Jesus we
[45:42] desire for all the glory to go to you.
[45:45] We know there's no way that we could be
[45:47] who we are in this world were it not for
[45:50] you. Was it not for your grace to each
[45:53] and every one of us, Lord Jesus,
[45:55] unmarited favor, Lord, where you had us
[45:58] in your mind before the foundation of
[46:00] the world to be able to be here hearing
[46:04] your word for the day in which we live.
[46:07] We thank you for that, Lord. We thank
[46:10] you for your presence this morning, this
[46:12] knowing, knowing, Lord, where two or
[46:13] three are gathered in your name, that
[46:15] you're already there. Amen. So, Father,
[46:18] we just want to ask, Lord Jesus, that
[46:20] you would have the preeminence that you
[46:21] desire and all that's said and all
[46:24] that's thought and all that's done in
[46:26] this service today, Father. We just ask,
[46:29] Lord, that you would give us ears to
[46:31] hear what your spirit saith unto the
[46:34] church, Lord. And, Father, that we would
[46:36] have those ears to be able to recognize
[46:38] it, Lord. And not just hear it, but
[46:40] Lord, a heart to receive it today. Amen.
[46:43] Father, we pray for the request, Lord,
[46:46] for Sister Emily's mom, Lord Jesus,
[46:48] traveling. We pray that you would just
[46:50] watch over her, Father. Be with her
[46:52] while she's away and then bring her back
[46:54] home safely at the appointed time.
[46:57] Father, we pray for Sister Mary, Lord,
[47:00] who is not feeling well. We pray that
[47:02] you would just touch her. Lord, we know
[47:04] how difficult it is to be a mom and the
[47:06] requirements, the pressures in the life
[47:08] of the the mom in the home. Lord, we
[47:11] pray that you would just give her
[47:12] strength, Lord. Amen. Give her
[47:15] encouragement, Lord Jesus. We pray that
[47:17] you would just raise her up, Lord.
[47:20] Father, we just ask, Lord, now that you
[47:22] would meet each and every need, made
[47:23] known unto you today by the way of an
[47:25] uplift hand, Father. We know that you've
[47:28] created us this way so that you could
[47:31] express yourself to us and through us.
[47:34] And we pray for those, Lord, who aren't
[47:36] here this morning, wherever they are,
[47:38] whatever they're doing, Lord. Some might
[47:40] be traveling, some might be sick, and
[47:43] some might just be cold and indifferent.
[47:45] Lord, we pray that you would just be
[47:47] with each and every one, Father. Lord,
[47:50] that you would just light that fire,
[47:52] Lord Jesus, that once burned clear and
[47:54] bright, Lord. Father, I pray that prayer
[47:57] for each one of us, Lord. Oh, Father, we
[48:00] need you. We need more of you, Father,
[48:02] in the day in which we live. We just
[48:04] love you, Lord. and we thank you and we
[48:06] just want to commit each need into your
[48:08] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[48:10] Christ's name we pray.
[48:13] Amen. Amen. Thank you
[48:16] musicians and uh each one for the
[48:19] specials today. Certainly
[48:21] wonderful. Sets a beautiful
[48:24] atmosphere. We just like to welcome our
[48:26] visitors today. The Hansen's from
[48:29] Saskatchewan. God bless you. Long time
[48:33] no see. Good to see you again though.
[48:36] And uh we have brother Elisha visiting
[48:38] from
[48:40] BC. God bless you, brother. Certainly
[48:43] glad to see you. And uh Sister Emily
[48:50] Kenziki, I believe is her birthday
[48:53] today. Amen. We just want to acknowledge
[48:55] her. God richly bless you, sister.
[49:03] That's sister Becky. Becky
[49:05] NMF's mother, I believe. If you have
[49:08] your Bibles this morning, I would just
[49:10] like to turn to Romans chapter
[49:15] 10. Like to talk about a very familiar
[49:18] topic that I'm sure we're all very well
[49:21] familiar with. And
[49:23] uh
[49:24] hopefully we'd be preaching to the choir
[49:27] today, but I know we certainly have
[49:29] needs in our midst.
[49:31] And you know, sometimes
[49:33] we we can get truly saved and filled
[49:37] with the Holy Ghost and we can have our
[49:40] eagle eyes filmed over. That's a thing.
[49:43] Brother Brandham talked about that. And
[49:46] sometimes we just need a little bit of a
[49:48] an encouragement. So today, that's my
[49:51] prayer. That's my wish that we would be
[49:53] able to witness that in our lives. Amen.
[49:56] In Romans chapter
[49:58] 10, brethren, my heart's desire and
[50:01] prayer to God for Israel is that they
[50:05] might be saved.
[50:08] For I bear them record that they have a
[50:11] zeal of God, but not according to
[50:15] knowledge. And my Bible in the footnotes
[50:17] it says
[50:19] devotion. So I just I just would like to
[50:21] mention this too, brothers and sisters.
[50:23] Remember that every scripture has a
[50:25] compound revelation and meaning. So when
[50:28] we read this scripture today, let's not
[50:30] think about Israel and put it off
[50:32] thousands of miles away, thousands of
[50:34] years in the past. Let's bring it right
[50:36] down home today and see our name in this
[50:40] scripture
[50:41] here. For I bear record, verse two, I
[50:44] bear them record that they have a zeal
[50:47] of God, but not according to knowledge.
[50:50] For they being ignorant of God's
[50:53] righteousness, and going about to
[50:55] establish their own
[50:58] righteousness, have not submitted
[51:01] themselves unto the righteousness of
[51:05] God. For Christ is the end of the law
[51:09] for righteousness to everyone that
[51:12] believeth. And we know that that's under
[51:14] the new covenant, the New Testament. And
[51:16] that's where we live under that
[51:19] covenant, unmmerited grace. Amen. Verse
[51:23] four, for Christ is the end of the law
[51:27] of righteousness to everyone that
[51:30] believeth. Do you believe on him this
[51:32] morning? Amen. For Moses describeth the
[51:36] righteousness which is of the law, that
[51:40] the man which doeth these things shall
[51:43] live by them. But the righteousness
[51:46] which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
[51:51] say not in thine heart, who shall ascend
[51:54] into heaven, that is to bring Christ
[51:58] down from above? Or who shall descend
[52:02] into the deep? That is to bring up
[52:05] Christ again from the
[52:08] dead. But what saith it? The word is
[52:12] nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy
[52:16] heart. Amen. That is the word of faith
[52:20] which we preach.
[52:22] That if thou shalt
[52:24] confess with thy
[52:27] mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
[52:31] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[52:34] from the
[52:36] dead, thou shalt be saved.
[52:39] Isn't that beautiful? Amen. I feel like
[52:42] sometimes in our lives in the message of
[52:45] the hour, we can get so bogged down with
[52:48] the thinking that unless we see it
[52:50] through our glasses, were lost. This is
[52:55] the word of God. Amen. What is that last
[52:59] verse, last couple of verses, verse
[53:01] nine? that if thou shalt confess with
[53:03] thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall
[53:06] believe in thine heart, that God hath
[53:08] raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
[53:12] saved. Amen. For the heart of man
[53:15] believeth unto righteousness, and with
[53:17] the mouth confession is made unto
[53:20] salvation. Amen.
[53:23] For the scripture saith, whosoever
[53:25] believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
[53:28] For there is no difference between the
[53:29] Jew and the Greek. For the same Lord
[53:32] over all is rich unto all that call upon
[53:36] him.
[53:38] For whosoever shall call upon the name
[53:40] of the Lord shall be saved. Amen.
[53:44] How then shall they call upon him in
[53:46] whom they have not believed? And how
[53:49] shall they believe in him of whom they
[53:53] have not heard? And how shall they hear
[53:56] without a preacher? And how shall they
[53:59] preach except they be sent? As it is
[54:02] written, how beautiful are the feet of
[54:04] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[54:07] bring glad tidings of good things.
[54:10] But they have not all obeyed the
[54:14] gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath
[54:18] believed our report?
[54:22] So then faith cometh by hearing and
[54:26] hearing by the word of God. Let's just
[54:30] bow one more time. Heavenly Father,
[54:33] Lord, this morning I pray that you would
[54:35] just increase our faith. Amen. Lord
[54:37] Jesus, I pray that you would increase
[54:39] our hearing so that we could have more
[54:40] faith. And Lord, help me to get out of
[54:43] the way. Father, I pray that you could
[54:45] just Lord, take control of our service
[54:47] this morning. Lord, let us all get out
[54:49] of the way. Father, let the hearer and
[54:51] the speaker be one today. Father, let us
[54:53] be one with you. We pray that you would
[54:56] just be glorified now in all that's said
[54:58] and done. Father, in Jesus Christ's name
[55:00] we pray. Amen. God bless you this
[55:03] morning. You may be
[55:06] seated. We're certainly thankful to be
[55:09] back in service and uh I just really
[55:13] enjoy the scripture today. I believe the
[55:15] Lord just gave me something to go with
[55:16] and I'm really thankful for that. It's
[55:19] always uh interesting trying to find the
[55:22] mind of the Lord for a service. But you
[55:25] know when clarity comes and he gives us
[55:28] something a real direction, it is uh
[55:32] it's a real blessing. As our brother
[55:34] prayed this morning, I think it's just
[55:36] wonderful because the Lord did give us a
[55:38] word and uh here we are. We're certainly
[55:42] thankful. I trust that you had a a good
[55:45] start to the weekend and we can just get
[55:49] together and fellowship around the
[55:51] things of the Lord today.
[55:54] We had a nice little prayer meeting this
[55:56] Thursday and uh today I just would like
[55:59] to spa speak on uh verse
[56:03] 17 faith cometh by hearing.
[56:08] If I had to put a title that would be
[56:10] it. And I believe that's why we come to
[56:12] church. And I believe that's why we
[56:15] fellowship around the word of the Lord.
[56:17] I think it's a wonderful thing when we
[56:19] press play and we hear what the prophet
[56:22] said. And you know, I think it's so
[56:25] important to remember that it's not
[56:27] necessarily what the prophet said. We
[56:29] can get stuck on the prophet and what
[56:31] the prophet said, but we need to
[56:33] remember the prophet was actually the
[56:35] mouthpiece of God for the age. Just like
[56:38] every single church age, those church
[56:41] age messengers were not the message.
[56:44] They were the messengers and they
[56:47] brought a prophetic utterance from God.
[56:50] They opened their mouths and they spoke
[56:53] as they were led by the Holy Ghost in
[56:55] their
[56:56] lives. I think it's so beautiful that we
[56:59] can look at this scripture through the
[57:01] revelation of the word for our day and
[57:04] know where we stand. understanding that
[57:07] Christ is the end of the law of
[57:09] righteousness to everyone that
[57:11] believeth. And and I know I said earlier
[57:14] that we need to remember verse 8 and N.
[57:18] But what saith it? The word is nigh thee
[57:20] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[57:22] is the word of faith which we preach. If
[57:26] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[57:28] Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
[57:30] heart that God hath raised him from the
[57:32] dead, thou shalt be saved. For with a
[57:35] heart man believeth unto righteousness,
[57:38] and with a mouth confession is made unto
[57:42] salvation. It's a wonderful thing to
[57:44] realize this. I believe there is
[57:47] millions, there are millions and
[57:49] billions of people that will actually
[57:52] fall under this category. And I know
[57:54] we're there, too. And I don't mean to to
[57:56] say it in a way that could seem
[57:58] negative, but just because we can
[58:01] confess on the Lord Jesus Christ, it
[58:04] does not mean that we are truly
[58:07] elect. There is a difference. And I
[58:10] think it's a a wonderful thing. We've
[58:12] been studying what it means to have
[58:14] election to to look at election on
[58:16] Wednesday nights out of the the study
[58:18] that we took out of the exposition of
[58:20] the seven church ages, out of the
[58:22] Pergamian church age. Brother Brandham
[58:24] talks about election and how important
[58:27] it really is to understand. Um, but
[58:30] there's a difference between actually
[58:32] acknowledging Jesus Christ and being
[58:35] elected. That's right. Amen. There's
[58:37] millions and billions of impersonators
[58:39] of Christianity. And I'm going to say it
[58:41] that way today because I believe that's
[58:43] the way the prophet said it. And not
[58:44] just the way the prophet said it. I
[58:46] believe it's the way that God said it
[58:47] through the prophet. We need to
[58:49] understand there is a very clear
[58:51] difference. We can claim Jesus Christ.
[58:53] We can claim the blood. We can even
[58:55] claim Lord Jesus Christ. But unless he's
[58:58] Lord over every area of our life, he is
[59:00] not our Lord. And we can easily have a
[59:03] confession with our mouth that doesn't
[59:04] match our heart. Amen. Jesus even said
[59:07] it with their mouth. They speak, but
[59:11] their hearts are very far away from me.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:15] Many people, Brother Brandham says it,
[59:17] millions and billions of people will
[59:18] impersonate Christianity. And you know,
[59:21] I think it just comes down to the most
[59:23] basic things, but sometimes the most
[59:26] basic things are the most difficult
[59:27] things as human beings. That's where the
[59:30] devil comes around and trips us up
[59:32] because he gets us in our
[59:34] humanity. And I know because I'm a
[59:37] witness. He gets me in my humanity. And
[59:40] I I hate that. And and I know in Romans
[59:43] chapter 7, we we can look at this this
[59:46] scripture in Romans chapter 7 and think
[59:48] about what what kind of a vile man am I?
[59:52] And who who can save me from this this
[59:54] body of flesh, this pest house that I'm
[59:56] in? I constantly battle, you know, the
[59:59] the the flesh and our spirit are emnity
[1:00:03] with the word of God and the spirit of
[1:00:05] God. And they always will be. And I
[1:00:07] think it's really important to remind
[1:00:09] ourselves of this. We will never ever be
[1:00:11] able to fully mix this flesh with the
[1:00:14] word of God with the spirit of God. But
[1:00:17] what will happen is this flesh and this
[1:00:20] spirit will always come subjection to
[1:00:24] the word of God. Amen. When we truly are
[1:00:28] elected talking about faith
[1:00:31] today, faith cometh by hearing.
[1:00:35] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:00:38] word of God. It's very important to
[1:00:41] understand that we need the pure word of
[1:00:44] God. There's many many different
[1:00:45] ministries in this world. There's many
[1:00:47] different preachers in this world and I
[1:00:49] think it's kind of funny some of the
[1:00:51] things that I've seen I I've seen
[1:00:53] shared. You know, you'll you'll get uh
[1:00:55] uh this is this is here here this pastor
[1:01:00] or preacher I say pastor reluctantly
[1:01:02] hear this pastor's um exhortation and
[1:01:05] and this other one actually correcting
[1:01:08] bringing correction and and you see the
[1:01:11] video of a woman pastor preaching or a
[1:01:15] woman preaching in general and then you
[1:01:18] hear the other pastor's correction and
[1:01:20] he says so we have a woman preacher
[1:01:23] Enough said. There's nothing else to
[1:01:25] say. The whole world says that it's
[1:01:28] okay. But where did that come in?
[1:01:31] It's not right. One word off is the
[1:01:34] Garden of Eden. One word off is Satan's
[1:01:37] Eden. And that's what the Garden of Eden
[1:01:39] turned into. We know that. But faith
[1:01:41] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[1:01:44] word of God. It's got to be the pure
[1:01:46] word of God. And you know, Brother
[1:01:48] Bradom, he talks about it in the message
[1:01:50] of the hour, the new birth. And and I
[1:01:53] want to say this today. I think it's so
[1:01:55] important to recognize that if we truly
[1:01:57] hear the word of God, the pure word of
[1:01:59] God, and we truly are elected, that we
[1:02:01] truly will have a new birth. There's no
[1:02:04] way around that because the woman, the
[1:02:07] church is the female, the elected is the
[1:02:10] female, are the female, however you want
[1:02:12] to say that. And and the spirit of the
[1:02:15] Lord brings life to that female. Amen.
[1:02:19] Amen. And when that happens, there's a
[1:02:20] new birth. Amen. There's a new life that
[1:02:22] comes forward. And brother Brandham, he
[1:02:24] says it very clearly to to to not have
[1:02:27] any reaction to the word of God. To not
[1:02:29] have some sort of stimulation, to not
[1:02:32] have some sort of event in our life
[1:02:33] where we don't know whether we've
[1:02:35] actually had a new birth. Have we had a
[1:02:38] new birth? Brother Brandham says that
[1:02:40] every single birth is a mess.
[1:02:44] Every single birth you remember. He says
[1:02:48] that there's squalling that goes on.
[1:02:51] There's crying that goes on. There's
[1:02:53] something that takes place in the heart
[1:02:55] of a believer when there's a new birth.
[1:02:59] I think it's so incredible to look at
[1:03:02] it. You know, we just had had a new
[1:03:05] birth in our house. We had a dog have a
[1:03:08] dog that had puppies. And it's just
[1:03:10] wonderful to see life come into the
[1:03:13] world. Anybody that's ever had a child,
[1:03:16] you brother Bradom talks about the new
[1:03:18] birth. He says it. You go into a pig
[1:03:20] pen, it's a mess when there's a birth.
[1:03:22] You go into a barn, it's a mess when
[1:03:24] there's a birth. Out in the field where
[1:03:26] cattle have babies, calves, it's a mess.
[1:03:29] Amen. It's the way it is. He says, you
[1:03:32] go into a hospital room, a perfectly
[1:03:34] steriliz sterilized hospital room, you
[1:03:37] have a baby, human baby birth. It's a
[1:03:40] mess. It's the way it works. It's God's
[1:03:42] program. It's no different for a new
[1:03:45] birth. And you know, we're in a one room
[1:03:47] schoolhouse here. We know that. So the
[1:03:49] people who actually are the veterans and
[1:03:52] and you have the new birth and you can
[1:03:54] say, "I know I've got it and I had it at
[1:03:56] this specific time." Just say, "Amen."
[1:03:58] For those people that are actually
[1:04:00] looking for that new birth because the
[1:04:02] new birth is truly the baptism of the
[1:04:04] Holy Ghost. Amen. And and we've got
[1:04:06] supporting quotes to go with this today.
[1:04:08] I think it's important to make sure that
[1:04:09] we know that. But outside of the Holy
[1:04:11] Ghost, you haven't actually been born
[1:04:13] again. That's right. It's very important
[1:04:16] to understand this, brothers and
[1:04:17] sisters. And some people I know say,
[1:04:19] "Why does he always harp about the Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost?" Because if you don't got the
[1:04:22] Holy Ghost, you're not born again.
[1:04:25] That's right.
[1:04:27] And maybe some of the elders don't see
[1:04:29] it that way and they just want to keep
[1:04:30] it that way. And that's okay. It's fine.
[1:04:33] You can keep it that way. But there's a
[1:04:34] new generation of youth that are coming
[1:04:36] up that need to know the truth. And I'm
[1:04:38] going to say this. I'm not going to go
[1:04:40] and sit in that throne of judgment and
[1:04:42] have anybody stand before that throne
[1:04:44] and say, "You never taught the truth.
[1:04:46] You never said what the prophet said."
[1:04:48] I'm going to say what the prophet said.
[1:04:49] We have got to repent for our sins, get
[1:04:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:54] Christ for the remission of our sins so
[1:04:56] that we can get the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:58] Ghost. Then we have a new birth. Just
[1:05:00] claiming I I know the message of the
[1:05:02] hour. I I'm a part of a church. I'm a
[1:05:04] part of a church body. I listen to a
[1:05:06] message every single day. I've been to
[1:05:09] Jeffersonville. All of that is good. But
[1:05:11] are you saved? Have you received this
[1:05:15] Holy Ghost since you believe?
[1:05:18] Because if you don't know, you need to
[1:05:20] know.
[1:05:22] Outside of the Holy Ghost, there's no
[1:05:24] rapture.
[1:05:26] It's tribulation.
[1:05:27] And those people that go through the
[1:05:29] tribulation, some people want to go
[1:05:30] through the tribulation. I know it
[1:05:31] because I've talked to them.
[1:05:34] They say, "I live my life according to
[1:05:35] the message of the hour, the way that I
[1:05:37] I do, and that's just the way it's going
[1:05:39] to be." There's going to be people
[1:05:40] there. There are going to be people
[1:05:42] there, but they're going to give their
[1:05:44] life for this message. They're going to
[1:05:47] give their life for the testimony of
[1:05:49] Jesus Christ. We've been given a platter
[1:05:53] of unmmerited favor, grace,
[1:05:57] to just accept the word, to just believe
[1:05:58] the word. Amen. not try and produce the
[1:06:01] word, not try and associate with the
[1:06:03] word, just to allow the word to become
[1:06:06] us, to allow ourselves to humble
[1:06:08] ourselves to the word of
[1:06:10] God. The new birth is a mess, brothers
[1:06:13] and sisters. It's not it's not an easy
[1:06:16] thing. It's not a simple thing. We don't
[1:06:19] just get the Holy Ghost and and there's
[1:06:21] no sensation. Brother Brandham says it's
[1:06:23] without sensation. I'll say it this way.
[1:06:24] I agree with that. But it's not without
[1:06:26] emotion.
[1:06:28] If you've ever witnessed the birth of a
[1:06:30] baby, how many have ever witnessed the
[1:06:32] birth of a baby, even someone else's,
[1:06:35] and not gotten
[1:06:37] emotional, we hold babies and get
[1:06:41] emotional. Something takes place, but
[1:06:44] when the Holy Ghost comes, it is without
[1:06:46] sensation because it's not about some
[1:06:49] sort of sensation or some sort of
[1:06:51] fanaticism. Remember, the devil can
[1:06:53] impersonate any gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:57] Brother Brandham says that that's
[1:06:58] astounding to think about. The only
[1:07:00] thing he can't do is accept the word.
[1:07:03] That's all.
[1:07:07] But when someone says they accept the
[1:07:08] word and they truly are baptized with
[1:07:11] the Holy Ghost, what's going to
[1:07:13] happen? They're going to live that word.
[1:07:16] They're not just going to say, "I
[1:07:18] believe that word. Amen. I got the Holy
[1:07:20] Ghost." When that happens, they're
[1:07:22] confessing with their mouth, but their
[1:07:23] heart is very far away.
[1:07:26] Out of 1958 in church
[1:07:28] order, you know, the the baptism of the
[1:07:31] Holy Ghost, we we talked about this a
[1:07:32] while ago, and I think it's so important
[1:07:34] to just dwell here. So, just bear with
[1:07:36] me if if if you know this and and it's
[1:07:39] just
[1:07:40] maybe a little bit much, seems like
[1:07:43] we're laboring this. I know there's
[1:07:45] people that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:46] and they need the Holy Ghost. We have to
[1:07:48] have the Holy Ghost, brothers and
[1:07:49] sisters. Brother Vanam says this, "We
[1:07:52] believe that the Holy Spirit is putting
[1:07:54] the same vessel in service." So, we are
[1:07:58] vessels. We've talked about that.
[1:07:59] There's there's one lump of clay, right?
[1:08:03] We've talked about this and how it's
[1:08:04] divided. And two vessels are made with
[1:08:07] one lump of clay. This is out of the
[1:08:09] word. This is out of the Bible. And and
[1:08:11] one vessel is for honor and one vessel
[1:08:14] is for dishonor. One vessel will be
[1:08:16] filled with the Holy Spirit and the
[1:08:18] other one will just be left with
[1:08:19] whatever spirit the world has to offer
[1:08:21] it. And that's the way it is. One is
[1:08:23] elected and one is not elected. And the
[1:08:26] ones that aren't elected are are fit to
[1:08:28] be destroyed. That's the word of God.
[1:08:31] It's not up to us to decide who is who.
[1:08:33] It's up to God. And our actions will
[1:08:36] demonstrate what vessel we are. But he
[1:08:39] talks about this not being another step.
[1:08:43] It's the same thing, but it's just a
[1:08:45] furtherance. He says, "We believe that
[1:08:47] the Holy Spirit is putting the same
[1:08:50] vessel in service." The one that
[1:08:52] actually out of Romans chapter 10 here,
[1:08:54] confesses with the mouth, believes with
[1:08:57] the heart, confesses with the mouth,
[1:08:59] right? Repents, and then goes and gets
[1:09:03] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:04] Christ. That's the same same thing.
[1:09:08] Amen. We believe that the Holy Spirit is
[1:09:10] putting the same vessel in service. That
[1:09:12] the Holy Spirit is not another step of
[1:09:14] grace, but more of the same grace that
[1:09:19] fills the believer to the extent where
[1:09:21] the signs and wonders such as the
[1:09:23] apostolic gifts spoken of in 1
[1:09:26] Corinthians 12 manifest themselves
[1:09:29] through this believer. when the Holy
[1:09:31] Spirit comes in to take up the
[1:09:34] gift. I believe that the scripture
[1:09:38] teaches that gifts and callings are
[1:09:40] without repentance. Amen. That when we
[1:09:43] are born in this world, we are sent here
[1:09:46] by one purpose, that is of
[1:09:49] God. And that before we are even become
[1:09:52] adults, while we are yet, the gifts that
[1:09:57] we have of God is in us then.
[1:10:01] And only the filling of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:04] puts these gifts into
[1:10:08] operation. But we have them in the
[1:10:10] beginning such as teachers and apostles
[1:10:12] and prophets and gifts of tongues and
[1:10:14] the nine spiritual gifts according to 1
[1:10:16] Corinthians 12. Now we believe that
[1:10:18] these gifts are in operation today and
[1:10:20] they should be in every local church.
[1:10:26] Although in such we have found
[1:10:29] throughout the world that there is much
[1:10:31] fanaticism hooked along with people who
[1:10:35] profess to be apostolic
[1:10:38] believers. It can be very very easy to
[1:10:42] confess and to
[1:10:44] profess. Confession is is is is bearing
[1:10:48] our soul. Profession is maybe beating
[1:10:52] our chest and saying this is what I
[1:10:53] believe. I I believe the message of the
[1:10:55] hour. I believe I'm a Christian. You
[1:10:58] know what? We don't have to say a word
[1:10:59] to anyone. We can just live our lives
[1:11:02] before man and they will say, "What's
[1:11:04] the difference with you? What's the
[1:11:06] problem? Why why are you so different?
[1:11:09] We don't have to profess to people that
[1:11:12] we're Christian."
[1:11:14] He says, "Although and such we found
[1:11:16] throughout the world that there is much
[1:11:18] fanaticism hooked along with people who
[1:11:19] profess to be apostolic believers." This
[1:11:22] is what gives Christianity a bad name.
[1:11:24] What does Christian mean? It means to be
[1:11:28] Christlike.
[1:11:31] Christlike, not brother Barry with a
[1:11:35] little bit of Christ.
[1:11:37] It means to be Christlike in our lives.
[1:11:39] We have got to be demonstrating Christ.
[1:11:42] Living Christ. Amen. But there's a lot
[1:11:44] of people in the world that profess it,
[1:11:47] but they don't live it. That's right.
[1:11:49] And what happens is they bring a bad
[1:11:51] name to Christianity.
[1:11:54] But you know, I think it's so beautiful,
[1:11:56] brothers and sisters, just because we
[1:11:58] maybe can look around and see people
[1:12:00] even in the message, let's just be
[1:12:02] honest and and bring it right home
[1:12:04] because we're talking to the believers
[1:12:05] here and maybe young people that need to
[1:12:07] know this stuff just because we see
[1:12:10] people that maybe live a double life.
[1:12:12] Maybe we can't understand why they act
[1:12:14] the way they act. Maybe they're not
[1:12:15] living a double life, but maybe we just
[1:12:17] don't understand why they would be one
[1:12:19] way in one position and something
[1:12:21] totally different when it comes to
[1:12:22] church. It's not up to us to understand
[1:12:25] it. We're not going to be able to stand
[1:12:26] before God and say, "But don't you know,
[1:12:29] maybe this brother did this and this
[1:12:31] sister did that. That's why I behaved
[1:12:33] the way I behaved." God's not going to
[1:12:35] say, "Oh, that's okay, darling. Don't
[1:12:37] worry about that. Here's a past for
[1:12:39] you." He's going to say, "Did you accept
[1:12:41] my provision for the day in which you
[1:12:44] lived? Amen. That's right. So to get
[1:12:46] upset because someone stepped on your
[1:12:48] toes at church one day and now I'm just
[1:12:51] upset and I'm not going back to church
[1:12:52] again, that's not going to be enough on
[1:12:55] that day.
[1:12:58] Right?
[1:13:01] The fanaticism is what trips people up
[1:13:03] and that's where the devil loves it. He
[1:13:06] just loves to get in there. Oh my,
[1:13:08] someone gets hurt, they feel offended,
[1:13:11] and they got to run away.
[1:13:14] Why is there going to be different areas
[1:13:17] in
[1:13:18] heaven? There's going to be quadrants.
[1:13:21] Northeast, southeast, northwest,
[1:13:24] southwest, heaven. I think if there is,
[1:13:27] it'll be like north, northwest, like
[1:13:31] three-dimensional. Probably more
[1:13:33] triangular if anything according to the
[1:13:35] word of God. But there isn't going to be
[1:13:36] different areas. There isn't going to be
[1:13:38] different camps.
[1:13:40] My I've just been feasting and in in
[1:13:43] just after the feast of the trumpets in
[1:13:44] 1964 and going beyond the camp for the
[1:13:47] people that know that message. Brother
[1:13:49] Brandham talks about it many times.
[1:13:51] People want to just go beyond the camp
[1:13:52] of the Lord with their own ideas about
[1:13:55] how things should be. When we do that,
[1:13:57] we make a disgrace. We become fanatics.
[1:14:01] We need to just stay in the camp. But
[1:14:03] brother Bradom takes it and he says also
[1:14:06] we need to go beyond the camp. We need
[1:14:08] to go beyond just being safe in our
[1:14:10] comfort zone, saying that I know that I
[1:14:13] know and nobody can teach me otherwise.
[1:14:16] We've got to be willing to allow the
[1:14:17] spirit to reveal himself to
[1:14:20] us. I think it's awesome how he says
[1:14:23] this that you know the gifts now we
[1:14:25] believe that these gifts are in
[1:14:27] operation today. Corinthians 12, 1
[1:14:29] Corinthians 12, these gifts are in
[1:14:31] operation today and they should be in
[1:14:33] every local church. But why aren't they?
[1:14:36] Many times it's because of the
[1:14:37] fanaticism that we've witnessed in our
[1:14:39] lives. We've seen people acting out and
[1:14:42] and and maybe seeing things happen the
[1:14:44] way they're not supposed to happen
[1:14:46] according to church order and what God
[1:14:48] said through the prophet in the day in
[1:14:49] which we live. Does that change the fact
[1:14:51] that the gifts are real and that the
[1:14:53] prophet said they should be in operation
[1:14:55] in the local church? It doesn't change
[1:14:58] it one bit. Amen.
[1:15:00] Doesn't matter if someone steps on our
[1:15:02] toes. Doesn't matter if somebody acts
[1:15:03] out of order in church. I'm not going to
[1:15:06] stop serving God.
[1:15:11] Although in such we found throughout the
[1:15:13] world that there is much fanaticism
[1:15:15] hooked along with people who profess
[1:15:18] apos profess to be apostolic
[1:15:21] believers just as they are in other
[1:15:25] orders and so forth. We have fanatics.
[1:15:31] It's not just brother Barry saying this
[1:15:33] is, you know, let's just take the
[1:15:35] message and mix it up a little bit. This
[1:15:36] is a prophet saying this. We have
[1:15:38] fanatics. There's fanatics. There's
[1:15:40] fanatics. And I'm not going to go into
[1:15:42] examples and and whatever. I I'm just
[1:15:45] going to say there's fanatics. So, young
[1:15:46] people, old people, middle people,
[1:15:49] there's fanatics. There's always going
[1:15:50] to be fanatics. Don't let it get in the
[1:15:52] way of serving God with all of your
[1:15:54] heart. Don't let it get in the way of
[1:15:57] worshiping God with all you've got to
[1:15:59] worship him with.
[1:16:02] It's the devil.
[1:16:05] Just as they are in other orders and so
[1:16:07] forth, we have fanatics. Yes, we do. I'm
[1:16:10] not saying there's any here, just for
[1:16:12] the record. That's been all along. And
[1:16:15] we've had those through the ages. They
[1:16:17] had in the apostolic day. And as Paul
[1:16:20] said there that how that some had come
[1:16:24] and persuaded them away after other
[1:16:27] doctrines and so forth. But in his own
[1:16:30] teaching he said if an angel from heaven
[1:16:35] would teach anything
[1:16:37] else than what he had taught, let him be
[1:16:41] accursed.
[1:16:43] I just think this is so good. This is
[1:16:46] the fundamental foundation for the
[1:16:51] church. But many times we'll say, well,
[1:16:54] maybe the church is do we
[1:16:56] won't. Where did it where did it become
[1:16:59] legal according to the word of God for a
[1:17:00] woman to
[1:17:02] preach? I wonder
[1:17:06] that just
[1:17:08] because hundreds, thousands, maybe
[1:17:10] millions are out there doing it doesn't
[1:17:12] make it right.
[1:17:14] Same thing with a female wearing
[1:17:16] garments that pertain to a man.
[1:17:20] And same thing for a male wearing
[1:17:23] garments that pertain to a female. Both
[1:17:25] of those are called abomination in the
[1:17:28] Bible. Yes, sir.
[1:17:30] Just like a woman cutting her hair,
[1:17:32] which is her
[1:17:33] covering. Just like a man letting his
[1:17:35] hair grow out.
[1:17:39] My, you see, so many times men in the
[1:17:41] world, they're preachers, but they've
[1:17:43] got hair down past their
[1:17:45] shoulders. They've got all kinds of
[1:17:47] different
[1:17:48] manifestations. I just think it's so
[1:17:50] beautiful. When we truly believe the
[1:17:51] word of God, we're going to line up with
[1:17:53] the word for our day. Amen. It's a
[1:17:55] pretty simple thing. But simple is not
[1:17:58] easy, is it? God hiding himself in
[1:18:03] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:18:06] same. His hair is not long. His hair's
[1:18:08] not long. God bless you, brothers. You
[1:18:11] know what? I I probably need a haircut,
[1:18:13] too, myself. I'll be honest. But I'm
[1:18:16] talking about hair that's going down
[1:18:17] your back. I'm talking about men with
[1:18:19] with with man buns. Oh, Lord, forgive
[1:18:22] me. But what's the deal, right? The word
[1:18:25] of God says that a man should actually
[1:18:27] have his haircut. And the word of God
[1:18:29] says that a woman shouldn't cut her
[1:18:30] hair. These are these are simple things.
[1:18:33] These are fundamental things.
[1:18:36] But because all all manner of people are
[1:18:38] doing it, it seems to be okay. It's not
[1:18:40] okay. We're not going to get a pass for
[1:18:43] it.
[1:18:45] I think it's beautiful the scripture
[1:18:47] today, brothers and sisters, faith
[1:18:49] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:18:51] of God. And and maybe some people are
[1:18:53] saying, "So why are you picking on us
[1:18:55] today, Brother Barry?" I'm not trying to
[1:18:56] pick on anybody. I just want to say the
[1:18:58] truth. I just want to speak the truth
[1:19:00] because I know there's people that
[1:19:01] desire the Holy Ghost in their life. And
[1:19:03] the only way we're going to get the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost, brothers and sisters, is to come
[1:19:06] absolutely sincere to the word of God.
[1:19:08] If we have one iota of I can do this,
[1:19:11] even though the prophet said do that,
[1:19:13] we're not going to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:15] It's not going to happen. We have got to
[1:19:17] come exactly according to the recipe.
[1:19:18] Like we talked about on Wednesday, if
[1:19:20] you take a chocolate cake and you bake
[1:19:21] it and you just
[1:19:22] substitute salt for the sugar, it's
[1:19:26] going to taste horrible. It might look
[1:19:27] exactly the same, might have the exact
[1:19:29] same texture. I don't know if it would.
[1:19:30] Someone here who bakes might know, but
[1:19:32] it might look exactly the the right way,
[1:19:35] but as soon as you taste it, you're
[1:19:37] going to want to throw up. And we know
[1:19:39] that's what the Lord said, right, for
[1:19:41] the Leodysian church age. Because you're
[1:19:43] not hot, because you're not cold and
[1:19:46] you're lukewarm, I'll spew you out of my
[1:19:49] mouth.
[1:19:50] It's not appetizing. But when we bring a
[1:19:53] sacrifice of
[1:19:55] praise, I know we talked about it many
[1:19:58] times. It's a joyful noise. It doesn't
[1:19:59] have to be perfectly tuned, perfectly
[1:20:01] timed, perfect, perfect, perfect,
[1:20:03] perfect. When we start with that
[1:20:04] business, then it's not even his
[1:20:06] righteousness. It's ours. And we know
[1:20:08] that's filthy rags before the Lord. We
[1:20:11] want to just allow his spirit to have
[1:20:13] liberty in our midst. You know, in in in
[1:20:16] 1963, Brother Brandham in Is worthy of
[1:20:20] the gospel,
[1:20:22] he talks about there being no
[1:20:26] Christianity there at all.
[1:20:29] I think this is so important, brothers
[1:20:31] and sisters, to the day in which we
[1:20:33] live. We know the prophet was storing up
[1:20:35] food for a season. And I can't help but
[1:20:37] think this is a this is a time when
[1:20:40] there is a famine in the land, is there
[1:20:42] not? And it's not a famine for food,
[1:20:44] man. We got more food than we could ever
[1:20:46] know what to do with in in in the place
[1:20:48] in which we live. If anybody here is
[1:20:50] starving for food, goodness, just let us
[1:20:52] know and we can certainly help you out.
[1:20:54] But I don't think anybody here is
[1:20:55] starving for food. We we're not starving
[1:20:58] for food. There's not a famine for food
[1:21:00] in the land. It's a famine for the word
[1:21:03] of God. It's a famine to actually desire
[1:21:06] the sincere word of God in the day in
[1:21:09] which we live. But brother Bham talks
[1:21:10] about this in 1963. Is your life worthy
[1:21:13] of the gospel? He says when this takes
[1:21:16] place, the thing you'll do then you'll
[1:21:19] find out that the spirit comes in you
[1:21:24] from the new birth. You will believe and
[1:21:28] do everything that God says in his word
[1:21:32] is for you.
[1:21:34] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:21:36] Amen. Talking about faith cometh by
[1:21:39] hearing and hearing of the word of God.
[1:21:42] And when that faith comes into us,
[1:21:44] brothers and sisters, we just want to
[1:21:45] line up with the word all the way with
[1:21:47] the word. There's no excuses. There's no
[1:21:49] no way that we're going to say, "Well, I
[1:21:51] I've been baptized in titles. I'm good.
[1:21:54] I was baptized in the name of the
[1:21:56] father, the son, the holy ghost. I could
[1:21:58] have done that myself. I was when I was
[1:22:01] back in the Pentecostal church. I was
[1:22:04] baptized in titles. But I came to know
[1:22:06] there was actually something a little
[1:22:08] more. And and what happened was I wanted
[1:22:11] to line up with that. If there is a
[1:22:13] promise in that word for me, then I want
[1:22:14] it. I want all of it. I don't want part
[1:22:16] of it. Yes. I want all of that promise.
[1:22:19] How many people are either all the way
[1:22:21] in or all the way out here today? Amen.
[1:22:25] Not just partial here, partial there. I
[1:22:28] know there's some very passionate
[1:22:29] individuals here. And and through that
[1:22:32] passion, it causes us to act and act
[1:22:35] hard on the things that we encounter.
[1:22:37] And I highly recommend it. Don't love
[1:22:40] halfway. Don't serve halfway. Don't go
[1:22:43] to work and only do a halfbaked job for
[1:22:46] your boss.
[1:22:48] Give everything you've got in your life
[1:22:51] and see if God won't bless it.
[1:22:55] The spirit comes in you from the new
[1:22:57] birth. You will believe and do
[1:23:01] everything that God says in his word is
[1:23:04] for you to do.
[1:23:08] And everything the Bible quotes for you
[1:23:11] to
[1:23:12] do, you'll punctuate it with an amen.
[1:23:16] Amen.
[1:23:18] And you know, I want to say this, when
[1:23:20] we punctuate it with an amen, the level
[1:23:21] he's talking about here isn't just
[1:23:23] saying amen in church, even though he
[1:23:25] is. Because if you want a blessing,
[1:23:27] brothers and sisters, come and say amen
[1:23:28] to a live ministry and watch your amens
[1:23:33] take the ministry and meet the need in
[1:23:35] your life. Watch the amens speak to the
[1:23:40] minister, which actually causes him to
[1:23:42] surrender further to the word, and God
[1:23:44] will speak to you. Amen.
[1:23:48] You'll punctuate it with an amen. And
[1:23:49] you'll not stop day and night until you
[1:23:52] receive it. That's right. That's right.
[1:23:55] And in all this time, you'll certainly
[1:23:58] above everything bear the fruit of the
[1:24:01] spirit. Amen. Amen. My I think this is
[1:24:04] so good. We will bear the fruit of the
[1:24:06] spirit. Brothers and sisters, you say,
[1:24:08] "Will I speak with tongues?" You might
[1:24:10] do that and you might not.
[1:24:14] Will I
[1:24:15] shout? You might do that. You might
[1:24:18] not. But there's one sure thing you will
[1:24:22] do. You will bear the fruit of the
[1:24:26] spirit.
[1:24:28] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:24:30] I I I don't know. I think it's really
[1:24:33] important just to take a step back
[1:24:35] sometimes and dwell on these things
[1:24:36] because they can be com common. We can
[1:24:39] maybe take them for granted, things that
[1:24:41] we just know. I I came from the
[1:24:43] Pentecostal ranks and I remember vividly
[1:24:45] hearing that the the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:48] Ghost is the initial evidence is when
[1:24:50] you speak in tongues and I remember
[1:24:52] vividly lots of tongue speaking, lots of
[1:24:55] tongue speaking, lots of
[1:24:56] interpretations, lots and lots and lots.
[1:24:58] It was just common place. Was it wrong?
[1:25:02] Maybe, maybe not. Was it the spirit of
[1:25:05] God? Yes. Was it actually according to
[1:25:09] the word of God? Maybe. Maybe not. I was
[1:25:11] too young to be able to tell for sure.
[1:25:13] But I remember vividly someone speaking
[1:25:16] in tongues and another one interpreting
[1:25:19] standing at the front of the church on
[1:25:20] that side. I was little sitting back
[1:25:22] over here on this side of the church and
[1:25:24] and vividly remember a tight leather
[1:25:27] miniskirt. A granny, she was probably 50
[1:25:30] years old to me at the time. I'm 52. But
[1:25:35] but here she was at the front of the
[1:25:36] church interpreting with high heels,
[1:25:39] tight leather minikirt, earrings, and
[1:25:41] short hair. And she would just speak the
[1:25:43] word of God just with all of her voice.
[1:25:45] Just shout it. And I remember hearing
[1:25:48] this and and and growing up thinking,
[1:25:50] "Wow, that must have been the spirit of
[1:25:52] God." And then I came around the message
[1:25:53] of the hour and thought, "No, they're
[1:25:55] all false. It's all wrong. It's all
[1:25:57] improper. It's out of order. Those
[1:25:59] people are sinners. Doomed." But then I
[1:26:02] heard anointed once at the end time and
[1:26:04] recognize it is the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:26:09] It's just a false vessel. It's the wrong
[1:26:11] vessel. Whether that woman is saved or
[1:26:13] not, I I don't know. It's not up to me
[1:26:14] to decide that. It's up to God.
[1:26:18] But I can say for sure that I've
[1:26:19] witnessed that. But you know, just
[1:26:21] because that happens, it doesn't mean
[1:26:24] it's right is my point. Just because
[1:26:26] that happens, it doesn't mean it's
[1:26:29] wrong. We need to be very careful.
[1:26:32] Like I said earlier, just because we've
[1:26:34] maybe seen fanaticism or heard
[1:26:36] fanaticism, don't don't don't get upset.
[1:26:39] Don't get upset when we see someone
[1:26:40] speak in tonesues here. I'm not trying
[1:26:42] to preach that we need to speak in
[1:26:43] tongues. What I am saying is the prophet
[1:26:45] of God yet God said through the prophet
[1:26:49] that these gifts would be in every
[1:26:51] single local church. So, we don't need
[1:26:54] to get uncomfortable. If we're getting
[1:26:55] uncomfortable, there's something wrong
[1:26:57] because it's the spirit of God and those
[1:26:59] gifts are supposed to be in the church.
[1:27:01] Amen.
[1:27:03] I love how he says it here, but there's
[1:27:04] one sure thing you will do. You will
[1:27:06] bear the fruit of the spirit. I say,
[1:27:09] Lord, help me to bear the fruit of the
[1:27:12] spirit. I don't want to just profess. I
[1:27:15] know the message. When people ask me,
[1:27:17] "What do you do?" "Oh, I'm a
[1:27:19] pastor." "You're a pastor." I want
[1:27:22] people to say, "What's wrong with you?
[1:27:24] Why are you so different? Why do you
[1:27:27] actually have such an atmosphere around
[1:27:29] you all the time? That's what I want to
[1:27:32] have. And then be able to say, well, I,
[1:27:34] you know, I go to a church. I don't want
[1:27:37] to be beating my chest saying, I'm a
[1:27:38] pastor. I'm a pastor. I believe the
[1:27:40] message of the hour. I want to say that
[1:27:42] I'm a Christian. I'm a true Christian.
[1:27:44] Because really, brothers and sisters,
[1:27:46] we're going to get to the quote. I'm
[1:27:47] going to jump ahead like I always do.
[1:27:48] The only true Christians in the world
[1:27:50] today are the ones that believe this
[1:27:52] message of the hour. Now I'm not saying
[1:27:55] the message according to William Mary
[1:27:56] and Brandham. I'm saying the message
[1:27:58] according to Paul the
[1:27:59] Apostle. If any angel any man or an
[1:28:04] angel come and preach any other gospel
[1:28:07] than what I've already preached than
[1:28:09] what we've already taught, what we've
[1:28:10] already heard, what Paul said, then let
[1:28:12] him be accursed. Right? He set the
[1:28:15] pattern in order. Who changed that? Why
[1:28:19] did it change? I think it's beautiful.
[1:28:22] That's why I'm harping today because we
[1:28:23] had a prophet come and say, "Get back in
[1:28:26] line with the word." Just get in line
[1:28:29] with the word. And I talk about it many
[1:28:31] times. I can't help but think about it
[1:28:33] what it would have been like in in the
[1:28:34] times of Jeremiah in in Israel in
[1:28:38] Jerusalem, the prophet of God crying
[1:28:40] out, "Just get back to the word." If the
[1:28:43] king would just humble himself in the
[1:28:45] sight of the Lord, he could live.
[1:28:49] It's no different today.
[1:28:52] only the king that's actually got the
[1:28:54] city under siege. He's the king of the
[1:28:56] whole earth right now, this earth, the
[1:28:59] way the condition it is. He's the god of
[1:29:01] this evil age. Once upon a time, it was
[1:29:04] the king of Assyria that that the that
[1:29:06] was surrounding the city. It was the
[1:29:08] king of the north. It was it was the
[1:29:11] fury from the north that was like the
[1:29:13] boiling seething pot pouring out.
[1:29:16] But today we've got highly polished,
[1:29:20] beautiful
[1:29:21] preachers not preaching the word of the
[1:29:25] vindicated
[1:29:28] prophet. But there's one sure thing you
[1:29:30] will do. You will bear the fruit of the
[1:29:32] spirit. And the fruit of the spirit is
[1:29:34] love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering,
[1:29:37] meekness, gentleness, patience.
[1:29:40] He says your temper will not be ooh just
[1:29:45] remember when you got that that poisons
[1:29:50] the Holy Spirit away from you.
[1:29:54] See when we got a
[1:29:56] temper the temper poisons the Holy
[1:30:00] Spirit away from
[1:30:02] us. I say Lord help me not have a
[1:30:05] temper.
[1:30:06] Help me not get into a position where I
[1:30:10] just hold on to things because I've got
[1:30:12] a temper, because I'm angry, because I
[1:30:14] think that if I get mad and I just
[1:30:16] express my anger to everyone, somehow
[1:30:18] the situation's going to get better. Why
[1:30:20] do we think
[1:30:21] that as human beings? Why do we think
[1:30:23] that if we express our anger in the
[1:30:25] situation, somehow the world's going to
[1:30:27] get better?
[1:30:30] Sometimes I think people get afraid
[1:30:32] because you look like a lunatic.
[1:30:36] But it sure doesn't help us in our
[1:30:38] marriage. It sure doesn't help us with
[1:30:40] our neighbors. It sure doesn't allow us
[1:30:42] to demonstrate the fruit of the spirit.
[1:30:44] I think it's so beautiful the way that
[1:30:46] came to me the one time. You know, the
[1:30:47] fruit of the spirit is not for us to
[1:30:49] pick off our own tree. It's for other
[1:30:51] people to actually partake from our
[1:30:54] tree.
[1:30:55] Someone going through a terrible
[1:30:57] situation, they might just need a little
[1:30:58] bit of joy in their life. And we come
[1:31:00] into the room with the fruit of the
[1:31:02] spirit. They can say, "Whoa, look at
[1:31:04] that nice, ripe joy." And not even
[1:31:07] understand what they're doing, but
[1:31:09] somehow they just love to be around you.
[1:31:11] Amen.
[1:31:13] And when they do, it's a good thing. But
[1:31:16] that fruit of the spirit is what we
[1:31:18] need. He says, "When you get to a place
[1:31:20] that you want to fuss with everybody you
[1:31:23] come along
[1:31:25] to, there's something wrong." And you
[1:31:28] know what I'll say, brothers and
[1:31:29] sisters? I'll tell you what it is. It's
[1:31:31] a critical spirit. Sometimes we can get
[1:31:33] that way. That tie isn't straight. Oh,
[1:31:36] there's no
[1:31:38] tie. That hair is a little bit long.
[1:31:40] That hair is a little bit short. That
[1:31:43] guy yells. He's got bad breath. Oh, he
[1:31:46] didn't say this. He didn't sing that
[1:31:48] song. We didn't do this. We should have
[1:31:49] done that or the other. As soon as we're
[1:31:52] doing that, what does he say here? Your
[1:31:55] temper is one thing, but when you get to
[1:31:57] a place that you fuss with everybody you
[1:32:01] come along to, there's something wrong.
[1:32:04] When you get to a place where the a
[1:32:08] minister will read from the Bible and
[1:32:10] it's wrong to do a certain thing and
[1:32:13] you'll just we know what he's saying.
[1:32:15] When when you'll just wse at it or
[1:32:17] you'll say, "Ah, I've heard it or I'll
[1:32:19] take that with a grain of salt. I'm not
[1:32:21] going to accept that because I've
[1:32:22] already got it or whatever." When that
[1:32:24] happens, brother Brandham, he says
[1:32:26] there's no Christianity there at all.
[1:32:31] This is the prophet. This is God
[1:32:34] speaking through his speaker to this
[1:32:37] age. Amen.
[1:32:40] And we're busy fussing about things,
[1:32:42] fussing about this, fussing about that.
[1:32:44] Oh, there's this, there's that. We call
[1:32:45] it nitpicking, don't we? nitpicking
[1:32:48] about this. The way he plays, the way he
[1:32:50] doesn't play, the way the music is, the
[1:32:52] way we could go on and on and on and on
[1:32:55] and on about it. Maybe sometimes when we
[1:32:56] go out to a restaurant, you could never
[1:32:58] sit down and just eat because there's
[1:33:00] always something wrong.
[1:33:06] Brother Brandham, he says it. Just
[1:33:07] remember, there's no Christianity there
[1:33:09] at all. And I want to say this, that
[1:33:11] doesn't mean that if a person has a
[1:33:14] devil coming around and causing them to
[1:33:16] behave this way, it doesn't mean they're
[1:33:18] not a Christian because they might go
[1:33:20] and fight that battle every single day.
[1:33:22] They get up. Paul said, "I die daily."
[1:33:25] What did he contend with? I can only
[1:33:27] imagine if he was a Hebrew of Hebrews of
[1:33:29] the tribe of Benjamin understanding all
[1:33:32] that was ever taught by the
[1:33:35] theologians, his knowledge, he would
[1:33:38] have had to kill it every single day.
[1:33:40] And I can only imagine that's why he
[1:33:41] said I had to take everything that I
[1:33:43] thought I knew after I got knocked down
[1:33:46] off my high horse by that pillar of fire
[1:33:49] for the day in which I lived. When I
[1:33:51] actually saw the revelation, I didn't
[1:33:54] just say, "Wow, I had a tremendous
[1:33:56] experience in my life. I know I'm
[1:33:58] saved." He said, "I went out into
[1:34:00] Arabia. I took four years of my life and
[1:34:04] I went and compared the scripture with
[1:34:07] the revelations that were bursting in my
[1:34:09] soul.
[1:34:11] And by taking the word of God and the
[1:34:15] revelations, he was able to come to a
[1:34:17] conclusion. All that I thought that I
[1:34:19] knew, I had to kill. I had to throw it
[1:34:21] out. Brothers and sisters, I want to say
[1:34:22] it today. There could be some sitting
[1:34:24] here that believe that they know the
[1:34:26] message of the hour for 40 years. And
[1:34:29] the spirit of God is crying out to you
[1:34:31] to throw out all that you know and just
[1:34:33] allow him to minister to you fresh
[1:34:36] today. Not because of brother Barry. I
[1:34:39] got nothing to offer. But I'll tell you
[1:34:40] what, he's got everything to offer.
[1:34:45] But when we're busy fussing and acting
[1:34:47] that way with a temper or whatever, he
[1:34:49] says there's no Christianity there at
[1:34:52] all.
[1:34:53] He says now that's now that by their
[1:34:57] fruits you shall know them. That's what
[1:35:00] Jesus said. See it can be real easy to
[1:35:03] confess. It can be real easy to profess.
[1:35:06] Oh my. We say it many times. Talk is
[1:35:09] cheap. But can we walk the walk instead
[1:35:11] of talking the
[1:35:13] talk? I'm preaching to me here. Can we
[1:35:16] do that? Does the world around us see
[1:35:19] Jesus Christ when we walk into a room?
[1:35:24] The last thing we want is for people to
[1:35:27] think that there's no Christianity there
[1:35:29] at
[1:35:30] all. And I can't help but think if we
[1:35:32] have to try and say, you know, I'm a
[1:35:34] Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:35:35] Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:35:36] Christian. Why are we saying that? It's
[1:35:38] like someone going around and saying,
[1:35:39] "I'm rich. I got lots of
[1:35:43] money. I got to buy a Corvette and I got
[1:35:46] to put really shiny rims on it and I've
[1:35:48] got to have a big fat house and I've got
[1:35:50] to do all this stuff. I got to have
[1:35:53] maybe bling. I got to have all this
[1:35:55] stuff in my life so that people can see
[1:35:57] that I'm rich.
[1:35:59] Why?
[1:36:02] What's the
[1:36:04] point? I would say this. If we're rich
[1:36:06] in worldly goods and devoid of the
[1:36:09] spirit of God, there's a problem.
[1:36:13] He says if it's the word and God said so
[1:36:16] that spirit in you will cope with that
[1:36:20] word every
[1:36:21] time. You know that word cope. I think
[1:36:24] we talked about this in the past and I'm
[1:36:25] just going to say it again. I think it's
[1:36:27] really important to understand it. I
[1:36:30] don't think that word cope means that
[1:36:32] we're just going to be able to make do
[1:36:33] with it and bear with it and and be able
[1:36:35] to just have patience with it and and
[1:36:38] and just withstand it and, you know,
[1:36:41] exercise our our our patience to just be
[1:36:44] able to endure. Listening to brother
[1:36:45] Barry harp about this again for another
[1:36:48] hour, just cope with it, just barely get
[1:36:50] by. I don't think that's what he's
[1:36:51] saying at all. What I think he's talking
[1:36:53] about here is being able to cope is
[1:36:56] where you actually take something that
[1:36:58] has a pattern. Amen. If you look at
[1:37:00] crown molding in a building or even on a
[1:37:02] baseboard, we could all see the
[1:37:04] baseboard that's in the church here.
[1:37:05] There's a profile on that baseboard.
[1:37:07] When the two baseboards come together in
[1:37:09] the corner, somehow you have to get them
[1:37:11] to match up. Sometimes people don't do
[1:37:13] that. They just butt them up and put a
[1:37:15] little caulking on it and it looks
[1:37:17] awful. But you can actually cope them.
[1:37:20] you can cope them. And what you can do
[1:37:23] is take one and actually cut it out to
[1:37:25] the exact same pattern. That's called
[1:37:27] coping. And when you do that, when it's
[1:37:30] coped properly, it will come together
[1:37:32] and it will look like one, right? It
[1:37:34] won't look like two pieces of wood. You
[1:37:36] won't have to put any dap on it. You
[1:37:38] won't have to put any filler in there.
[1:37:40] All you would do is just put a little
[1:37:41] paint on it and it will look like it's
[1:37:43] one piece of wood. And I think this is
[1:37:46] so good, the word here. cope with that
[1:37:49] word every single time. We don't want
[1:37:51] the word to cope with us. We want us to
[1:37:55] cope with that word. We want to put
[1:37:57] ourselves on the chopping block and
[1:37:59] actually be able to be cut and shaped
[1:38:01] and molded just like that masterpiece,
[1:38:04] right? We were talking about to the
[1:38:07] place where he looks at that masterpiece
[1:38:09] and sees himself, sees his image in that
[1:38:12] masterpiece. And then he says, "Speak
[1:38:14] the word." It's the third pull. You've
[1:38:17] got nothing to be afraid
[1:38:18] of. If it's the word and God said so,
[1:38:21] that spirit in you will cope with that
[1:38:23] word every time because genuine Holy
[1:38:26] Spirit will cope with the word. Amen.
[1:38:32] Other spirits will make excuses.
[1:38:37] Jesus said, "My words are life." And if
[1:38:40] you've got eternal
[1:38:42] life and he is the word, how can the
[1:38:46] word deny the
[1:38:48] word? See, what kind of a
[1:38:52] person would you make God? That's one
[1:38:55] thing to know that when you're a
[1:38:57] Christian, when you can fully agree upon
[1:39:00] every word of God, and this is where it
[1:39:04] becomes so so dramatic and maybe so
[1:39:08] treacherous, so risky according to the
[1:39:11] message of the hour because some people
[1:39:12] will just say, "Well, brother Brandham,
[1:39:14] he fell off in 1965. He went over the
[1:39:17] edge and went into some crazy
[1:39:18] doctrines." But all he did was point
[1:39:20] back to the word of God. He didn't bring
[1:39:23] a new doctrine. He didn't bring a new
[1:39:24] word of God. He pointed back to the old
[1:39:26] original word of God. And many people
[1:39:28] don't like it because it actually it
[1:39:31] kind of hurts the flesh. It can pinch
[1:39:32] the flesh. And some of the new more
[1:39:34] modern versions of the Bible, they just
[1:39:36] disregard certain scriptures and they
[1:39:38] make it easier to be a Christian. I I
[1:39:41] think it's so wonderful. I heard a a
[1:39:42] term and I think it's important for us
[1:39:44] to maybe remember this term. There's
[1:39:46] something out there that's called easy
[1:39:48] belieism.
[1:39:51] Easy belieism. And that's what
[1:39:53] Christianity in on mass in this world is
[1:39:56] built
[1:39:57] upon. You can listen to rock and roll.
[1:40:00] It won't hurt you. You can have the odd
[1:40:02] drink. It's not a big deal. It's okay.
[1:40:05] We can go to shows, go to sporting
[1:40:08] events. We'll do all the stuff the world
[1:40:09] does and we'll get more excited when we
[1:40:12] go to those events and places than we
[1:40:14] would when we get into the house of God.
[1:40:17] Easy belieism. The interesting thing is
[1:40:20] though, the people in the world that are
[1:40:22] parts of the of the mainstream
[1:40:24] Christianity, they get right into the
[1:40:27] spirit of things, and I know we do too.
[1:40:30] But I think it's important to just
[1:40:32] remember it's a real fine line between
[1:40:35] having the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:37] believing that you do, but not
[1:40:39] actually. We don't want to confess with
[1:40:42] our mouth and then not go all the way.
[1:40:45] What good is that?
[1:40:47] I heard it said many
[1:40:49] times, be a miserable existence. It
[1:40:52] would be miserable to act like a
[1:40:54] Christian but not really reap the
[1:40:57] benefits of of of seeing what the Holy
[1:40:59] Ghost would do in our lives. Amen.
[1:41:06] 1963, a
[1:41:09] paradox says, "Now according to Webster,
[1:41:12] a
[1:41:13] paradox is something that seems
[1:41:15] incredible, but it's true."
[1:41:19] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:41:21] Incredible, but it's true. And that is
[1:41:24] an example of each and every one of us.
[1:41:26] Amen. in our lives, the lives that we
[1:41:28] live today. To be a Christian in this
[1:41:31] world, to be a real Christian in this
[1:41:33] world means that we're lining up with
[1:41:35] every word, not making excuses for it.
[1:41:38] That that's a paradox because not
[1:41:40] everyone can do
[1:41:42] it. Now, according to Webster, a paradox
[1:41:45] is something that seems incredible but
[1:41:47] is true. Therefore, a paradox then would
[1:41:51] be the same as a miracle.
[1:41:54] You know, brother Bradam says that
[1:41:55] that's the greatest miracle is the life
[1:41:58] of a believer being able to be
[1:42:00] transformed by the renewing of our minds
[1:42:02] to be go go from being a cockleber to
[1:42:04] being a wheat to to go from being a
[1:42:06] sinner to being a saint. That's the
[1:42:08] greatest miracle. It's a paradox. A
[1:42:11] paradox is when something that that
[1:42:13] seems like it just couldn't be. The
[1:42:16] knowledge of the human mind, it's
[1:42:19] altogether incredible.
[1:42:22] the knowledge of the human mind. Paul
[1:42:24] said, "I count it all
[1:42:28] dung for this revelation that I got from
[1:42:31] the Lord. I count it all dung." Human
[1:42:35] human knowledge. It's altogether
[1:42:37] incredible, but yet it's proven true.
[1:42:40] Our lives somehow we desire to serve
[1:42:42] God. We desire this message of the hour.
[1:42:44] We desire to press play when we're
[1:42:46] alone. When we could just turn on the
[1:42:48] radio, we could just turn on a talk
[1:42:50] show. We could just get on to Sirius XM
[1:42:53] radio. We could just follow the news,
[1:42:55] all of that. But something inside us
[1:42:57] constrains us to feed upon the word for
[1:42:59] our day. We want to hear the message of
[1:43:01] the hour. We want to hear the prophetic
[1:43:03] utterance. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:43:07] Now, a miracle would be the same thing
[1:43:09] for a miracle cannot be explained. A
[1:43:11] miracle is something that happens and
[1:43:14] you cannot explain it. That make it a
[1:43:17] paradox. It's incredible. But yet it's
[1:43:20] the
[1:43:21] truth. It's incredible that we can
[1:43:24] believe this word. It's incredible that
[1:43:25] we can hear this word. It's incredible
[1:43:28] that we can respond to it. Now, people
[1:43:31] today, a lot of modernists believe that
[1:43:34] the days of miracles are
[1:43:37] passed. They don't believe there is such
[1:43:39] a thing as a miracle. But yet, I believe
[1:43:43] that the world is full of miracles. I
[1:43:45] believe the paradox is constantly and I
[1:43:50] want to say this today brothers and
[1:43:51] sisters old and young the miracles
[1:43:54] happen constantly the paradoxes happen
[1:43:58] constantly in our lives I don't know if
[1:44:01] we've all experienced it I'm sure we
[1:44:03] have times in our life where we say how
[1:44:06] did that happen
[1:44:08] how could that possibly happen in my
[1:44:10] life in a good way sometimes we say that
[1:44:14] too in a bad way. How could that
[1:44:16] possibly happen? But I believe it's God
[1:44:19] in his grace because he always brings us
[1:44:21] through those negative ones. He always
[1:44:23] does. But there's many times there's so
[1:44:26] so good things, such good things that
[1:44:28] happen in our lives, we just cannot
[1:44:30] explain it. How did that happen? Right?
[1:44:34] It's God. It's a paradox. And the
[1:44:38] paradox is
[1:44:40] constantly for instance I believe that
[1:44:44] every born again member of the body of
[1:44:47] Christ is a paradox in
[1:44:51] themselves to be able to believe this
[1:44:53] word in the midst of a famine in the
[1:44:55] land. Nobody wants to hear the word of
[1:44:57] God. Nobody wants to hear about about a
[1:45:00] prophet especially that God would send a
[1:45:03] prophet to this age. This whole world is
[1:45:05] not interested. There's a few maybe
[1:45:08] there must be because we're still here.
[1:45:10] There's a couple last predestinated
[1:45:11] seeds, but it's not a great revival. The
[1:45:14] great revival happened. We know that
[1:45:16] back in the 50s, the 60s, lots of
[1:45:20] impersonators rose up.
[1:45:23] But the 70s happened. It's no wonder the
[1:45:25] prophet said, "I can't see anything past
[1:45:27] 1977."
[1:45:30] And he said, "I predict." He didn't say,
[1:45:32] "Thus sayaith the Lord," but it caused
[1:45:35] so many people, the fanaticisms, to go
[1:45:37] off.
[1:45:40] I believe that every born again member
[1:45:42] of the body of Christ is a paradox in
[1:45:44] themselves. I believe that each one of
[1:45:46] you Methodist and Presbyterian and
[1:45:48] Lutheran that never had experienced the
[1:45:50] baptism of the Holy
[1:45:52] Spirit, was in some formal church that
[1:45:55] did not believe in the genuine new birth
[1:45:59] and has now received the baptism of the
[1:46:01] Holy
[1:46:02] Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox.
[1:46:07] Isn't that beautiful? Oh
[1:46:10] my Excuse
[1:46:13] me. Woo. There's nowhere to hide when
[1:46:15] that comes.
[1:46:20] Amen. All these people, the
[1:46:23] Presbyterians, the Lutherans, and I'll
[1:46:25] say this,
[1:46:28] Pentecostals that never had experienced
[1:46:30] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, even
[1:46:32] though confessed with lips and went
[1:46:34] through the process, got baptized in
[1:46:37] water, but never really experienced the
[1:46:40] Holy Spirit, experienced the baptism of
[1:46:42] the Holy Spirit. was in some formal
[1:46:44] church that did not believe in the
[1:46:46] genuine new birth and has now received
[1:46:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:46:50] perfect example of a
[1:46:53] paradox because something happened to
[1:46:56] you that changed your whole being. Amen.
[1:46:59] And anyone could look at that and know
[1:47:03] what a paradox is a miracle. Amen.
[1:47:07] Anyone could look at your life and say,
[1:47:09] I know that something has happened
[1:47:11] there. I know that something has changed
[1:47:14] there. You are not the same person that
[1:47:17] you once
[1:47:19] were. Brother Brandham says unless that
[1:47:21] happens, you cannot be a Christian.
[1:47:25] We can claim it all we want. And I I
[1:47:28] I'll go further with it like I always
[1:47:29] do. We say brother Brandham said that.
[1:47:32] But who was speaking through brother
[1:47:34] Brandham? Jesus Christ. The same
[1:47:36] yesterday, today, and forever, right?
[1:47:38] Amen. Some might say, "Well, Brother
[1:47:39] Barry, he wasn't saying thus sayeth the
[1:47:42] Lord." That's okay. I mean, for some
[1:47:45] people, that's where they live. And
[1:47:46] that's
[1:47:47] okay. I just think it's important to
[1:47:49] recognize that unless that happens, you
[1:47:52] cannot be a Christian. Therefore, there
[1:47:54] must be a paradox for you to become a
[1:47:58] Christian.
[1:48:00] Something that's incredible but true. I
[1:48:03] just suddenly feel so much peace in my
[1:48:07] life.
[1:48:08] Instead of having such a desire to go
[1:48:11] and get back at people that mess me over
[1:48:15] or fussing at every single little
[1:48:17] nitpicky thing all along the way,
[1:48:19] driving everyone around me crazy because
[1:48:22] I've got a critical spirit on
[1:48:25] me. Something happens and I become soft
[1:48:31] and I become
[1:48:32] kind. Maybe I'm really impatient person
[1:48:35] and I just have no patience
[1:48:38] ever. God doesn't have to actually teach
[1:48:41] us patience. He doesn't have to teach us
[1:48:43] to not be critical. He can actually just
[1:48:45] give us his spirit, brothers and
[1:48:47] sisters. Amen. And we can become soft.
[1:48:51] We can become patient. We can become
[1:48:55] kind. We can have meekness, gentleness.
[1:49:00] not dragging around that ball and chain
[1:49:02] that I've had dragging me down. That
[1:49:04] person did me so bad so many decades ago
[1:49:08] and I just can't let go of it cuz you
[1:49:10] don't know how they hurt me. You know,
[1:49:13] brothers and sisters, I'll say that I'm
[1:49:15] a witness of it.
[1:49:18] I've been hurt, but that ain't stopping
[1:49:21] me.
[1:49:22] You know, forgiveness isn't necessarily
[1:49:24] for the person that did it to you.
[1:49:27] You're not giving them a pass and
[1:49:29] saying, you know, it's okay. You don't
[1:49:31] have to actually stand up and be
[1:49:33] accountable for what you did. You don't
[1:49:35] have to. It's okay. Here's a pass. Don't
[1:49:39] worry. What you're doing is saying, I
[1:49:42] absolve myself from dragging around that
[1:49:45] ball and chain. You what you did to me
[1:49:48] in my life will not dictate my future. I
[1:49:52] will not allow that. The spirit of
[1:49:55] Christ comes into us and shows us these
[1:49:57] things. Amen. I had a brother tell me,
[1:49:59] "You know what I do?" I said, "What do
[1:50:01] you do?" And he said, "I have uh a
[1:50:04] packet that I keep in my pocket
[1:50:06] everywhere I go. Every time I'm at home
[1:50:08] and when I leave the house, when I go to
[1:50:10] church, when I go to work, wherever I
[1:50:11] go, I've got this booklet." And what it
[1:50:14] is, it's a booklet of passes. And when
[1:50:16] people do things to me, I just give them
[1:50:18] a pass. There you go. and someone else
[1:50:21] does something and I just I just give
[1:50:23] them a pass. You know, that's the spirit
[1:50:25] of Christ, brothers and sisters, to be
[1:50:27] able to say, I know that come that day
[1:50:30] when I'm sitting in that throne of
[1:50:32] judgment and you're standing before the
[1:50:33] throne. That sounds really bold to say,
[1:50:35] but anybody outside of the spirit of
[1:50:37] Christ is going to be standing before
[1:50:39] that throne. That's not what we say.
[1:50:40] That's what God said.
[1:50:44] We're not going to actually want to see
[1:50:46] them go to hell.
[1:50:48] We're not going to want to wish that on
[1:50:50] our worst enemies.
[1:50:52] We're going to want to see every single
[1:50:54] person live. Amen. Amen. We're going to
[1:50:58] want to take We do want to take as many
[1:51:00] with us as we can, don't we? Don't we
[1:51:02] want to influence the world around us,
[1:51:04] see our our beautiful neighbors that
[1:51:06] don't know anything about God, but are
[1:51:08] so kind. Every single time it snows,
[1:51:09] they shovel our sidewalk and driveway.
[1:51:11] They come and rake our leaves. They come
[1:51:13] and and do things for us that we would
[1:51:15] never imagine doing for our other
[1:51:16] brother and sister in the church. Yet
[1:51:18] they're unbelievers.
[1:51:21] Anybody experienced people like that in
[1:51:22] this world?
[1:51:26] Don't think they're not going to see
[1:51:27] eternal life. That's right. Because even
[1:51:29] a cup of cold water won't be forgotten.
[1:51:33] But many times we can say in our own
[1:51:36] hearts, "Well, unless you see it my way,
[1:51:37] then there just can't be any Christian
[1:51:40] there."
[1:51:42] Maybe not because we already
[1:51:45] identified the Christian life in the day
[1:51:47] in which we live. To be truly be
[1:51:49] Christlike means that we're going to
[1:51:51] take every single word. Amen. And and
[1:51:54] the truly elected are the ones that are
[1:51:55] going to go in the rapture. There's
[1:51:56] millions and billions of people that are
[1:51:58] just going to say, you know what, I'm
[1:51:59] going to forfeit that and and
[1:52:00] potentially go and give my life someday.
[1:52:04] Just say, I'm going to live in pleasure
[1:52:05] for a season. And I'm not going to drag
[1:52:07] it out of bed on a Sunday morning to go
[1:52:09] and listen to some guy preach. I'm going
[1:52:13] to just stay home and sleep in and have
[1:52:15] coffee in bed or whatever it is we want
[1:52:16] to do on a Sunday
[1:52:18] morning. There's people that are going
[1:52:20] to do that. The word of God says that it
[1:52:21] would have been better for them to not
[1:52:22] even have known about the word of God
[1:52:24] than to actually spurn the mercy that
[1:52:26] was given and actually try and make it
[1:52:29] something that they want it to be. It's
[1:52:31] a paradox, brothers and sisters. It goes
[1:52:33] against our grain as a human being. How
[1:52:36] can we explain what it means to have
[1:52:38] love, joy, patience, meekness,
[1:52:42] gentleness? Some of us are just not
[1:52:44] gentle people.
[1:52:46] Some of us are very, very
[1:52:49] aggressive. But when the spirit of
[1:52:51] Christ comes in our life, it changes us.
[1:52:55] Brother Bradam says, "Unless that
[1:52:57] happens, you cannot be a Christian."
[1:53:00] There must be a paradox for you to
[1:53:02] become a Christian because no more no
[1:53:05] one can change a spirit in a man and
[1:53:08] give him a new birth. Give him new birth
[1:53:11] outside of God. God alone is the only
[1:53:15] one can do it.
[1:53:17] And it's a miracle how that God can take
[1:53:20] a man's thinking and his ways and his
[1:53:26] life and everything and change it from
[1:53:29] what it was to what it can be what he
[1:53:34] can make it. And you know, he's just I
[1:53:37] think it's so beautiful, brothers and
[1:53:39] sisters, on the Bible study. We're
[1:53:40] getting into it in the mornings, but you
[1:53:43] know, he's just standing at the door
[1:53:45] knocking, isn't he? What does that mean
[1:53:47] to us? When he stands at the door and
[1:53:49] knocks, is it this? I'm going to I'm
[1:53:52] just going to do this for the sake of
[1:53:53] discussion. We've got a door here. We've
[1:53:56] got the handle set. If you look up here,
[1:53:58] we've got hinges. There's a lock. We've
[1:54:00] got the closure. We've got the frame.
[1:54:03] We've got this door. Is Is he standing
[1:54:06] at the door knocking? Is that what we're
[1:54:08] thinking? Is that what we visualize? I
[1:54:11] mean, as humans, I think that's what we
[1:54:12] do. I did for a long time, but I
[1:54:14] couldn't help but think, you know, him
[1:54:17] standing at the door and knocking out of
[1:54:19] the book of
[1:54:20] Revelations. I I think we ought to maybe
[1:54:23] look at it from a little bit of a
[1:54:24] prophetic lens, step outside of our
[1:54:26] comfort zone and look at it from a
[1:54:28] different perspective. Could it be that
[1:54:31] picture that we see of a
[1:54:33] cloud? He's standing at the door
[1:54:36] knocking. There's only one church age
[1:54:38] where he's standing at the door knocking
[1:54:40] where he is put on the outside of the
[1:54:42] church.
[1:54:43] Now, I say it all the time. What
[1:54:44] happened at Sunset Mountain? I can't
[1:54:46] help but think that's Jesus Christ.
[1:54:47] Brother Brandham said it was Jesus
[1:54:49] Christ. It was the word coming of Jesus
[1:54:51] Christ standing at the door of the world
[1:54:54] knocking saying, "If you'll just let me
[1:54:56] in, I'll come in and I'll suck with you
[1:54:57] and you with me."
[1:55:00] Don't get caught up thinking about the
[1:55:01] way that we would rationalize things as
[1:55:03] a human. Let's take it to a paradoxical
[1:55:06] level and think about it through the
[1:55:07] lens of the Holy Ghost. That picture
[1:55:10] means way more than what it is than what
[1:55:13] we look at it and see. Jesus Christ
[1:55:15] himself, the word coming. Turn with me
[1:55:17] over to First
[1:55:19] Peter. We still have a couple minutes
[1:55:22] left. I'm thankful that I didn't burn up
[1:55:23] all my time with talking. First
[1:55:30] Peter 1 Peter chapter 1.
[1:55:41] Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to
[1:55:44] the strangers scattered throughout
[1:55:46] Pontius,
[1:55:48] Galatia, Capidoshia,
[1:55:51] Asia, and
[1:55:53] Bethia,
[1:55:55] elect according to the fornowledge of
[1:55:57] God the Father through sanctification of
[1:56:00] the Spirit, unto obedience,
[1:56:03] and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
[1:56:06] Christ. Grace unto you and peace be
[1:56:11] multiplied. Blessed be the God and
[1:56:13] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[1:56:15] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:56:18] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:56:21] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:56:23] the dead. You know, we we talked about
[1:56:26] this, brother Emanuel and brother Mvin
[1:56:29] both on the same talk topic. The
[1:56:31] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[1:56:33] dead is not about 2,000 years ago. It's
[1:56:37] not just about Easter time. It's about
[1:56:39] every time all the time. The present
[1:56:42] tense I am is the resurrection and the
[1:56:46] life in each and every one of us to an
[1:56:49] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled.
[1:56:53] and that fadeth not away reserved in
[1:56:56] heaven for you. What's that? Our
[1:56:58] theophanes, a sin-free body,
[1:57:03] imperfection, who are kept by the power
[1:57:05] of God through faith unto
[1:57:09] salvation, ready to be revealed in the
[1:57:11] last time. And we know already we're in
[1:57:14] the last time, right? wherein ye greatly
[1:57:17] rejoice, though now for a season, if
[1:57:20] need be, ye are in heaviness through
[1:57:22] manifold
[1:57:24] temptations. Remember, brothers and
[1:57:26] sisters, this is the trial. It's not the
[1:57:29] trial of our money. It's not the trial
[1:57:30] of our house. It's not even the trial of
[1:57:32] our marriage. It's the trial of our
[1:57:34] faith. The trial of your faith being
[1:57:38] much more
[1:57:39] precious than of gold that perisheth,
[1:57:43] though it be tried with
[1:57:45] fire, might be found unto praise and
[1:57:48] honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:57:51] Jesus Christ. And we know, brothers and
[1:57:54] sisters, we are talking about the coming
[1:57:57] of the Lord. We want to see the coming
[1:57:59] of the Lord in the clouds. But the
[1:58:01] appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:58:04] already happened. It's already
[1:58:05] happening. Brother Bradom says it in the
[1:58:07] message of the hour. This is the
[1:58:10] appearing.
[1:58:11] There's going to be a coming in the
[1:58:12] clouds. And I would say this, there's
[1:58:14] actually a bit of a coming in the heart
[1:58:16] of every one of his children. But as we
[1:58:18] live our lives according to this message
[1:58:20] of the hour, it is the appearing. That
[1:58:22] is the third pull after
[1:58:25] all. Verse eight. Whom having not seen
[1:58:28] ye love in whom though now ye see him
[1:58:31] not yet believing. How are we able to
[1:58:34] believe? Through his spirit. Yet rejoice
[1:58:38] yet ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:58:41] full of glory. receiving the end of your
[1:58:45] faith,
[1:58:47] even the salvation of your souls,
[1:58:50] of which salvation the prophets have
[1:58:52] inquired and searched diligently, who
[1:58:54] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:58:56] unto
[1:58:58] you. I can't help but think he's talking
[1:59:01] about us today. Amen. He's talking about
[1:59:04] me as
[1:59:10] well. 1 Peter 1, receiving the end of
[1:59:14] your faith. There comes a point in time,
[1:59:17] brothers and sisters, and I can't help
[1:59:18] but think it's when we get the new
[1:59:19] birth. And I don't think there is an
[1:59:21] actual definite uh a specific time or
[1:59:25] indicator when we receive the ending of
[1:59:27] our faith. But I I believe it this way.
[1:59:30] It's just my view. I'll say it. I'm not
[1:59:32] trying to indoctrinate anybody. But when
[1:59:34] we truly get the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:36] Ghost in our lives, we see things
[1:59:38] different.
[1:59:40] things become new. All old things are
[1:59:42] passed away. Behold, all things become
[1:59:45] new in our lives. It's it's receiving
[1:59:48] the end of our own faith. Receiving the
[1:59:50] the the idea that that things can be
[1:59:54] whatever way we want them to be, and we
[1:59:55] could just make an excuse for it. That's
[1:59:57] not the way it is. It's the end of our
[1:59:59] faith says, "Hey, you know what? I'm
[2:00:01] going to get back in line. I'm not going
[2:00:04] to march outside of the lineup." It's
[2:00:07] beautiful how brother Bradom talks about
[2:00:09] it, right? In in the preview of the
[2:00:10] bride, we know the story very well. The
[2:00:13] church nominal came into view once for
[2:00:17] every single age. Brother Brandham talks
[2:00:19] about how the church came into view and
[2:00:21] that vision that he had of all of the
[2:00:23] churches and the church of America. And
[2:00:25] he said she was led by a witch. She was
[2:00:28] wicked. She was naked,
[2:00:33] blind, couldn't see far off. Those are
[2:00:36] my words. I'm just putting them out
[2:00:37] there. Le oysian
[2:00:39] right naked blind thought that she was
[2:00:43] right but was very wrong marching out of
[2:00:45] step. Brother Bradom says that that
[2:00:47] church nominal was led by a witch. First
[2:00:50] he saw the
[2:00:52] bride but then she faded away. Some of
[2:00:55] them started to get out of line. Then
[2:00:57] then the church of America came and the
[2:00:59] church of all the different countries
[2:01:00] came. And you know at the end the bride
[2:01:05] came back into view again.
[2:01:07] Amen. And if we're living in the end,
[2:01:09] brothers and sisters, I can't help but
[2:01:10] think this is a time for us to get back
[2:01:12] in step just to get right back in line
[2:01:14] to say, "I I don't care about all the
[2:01:16] things that I've done in the past. I
[2:01:17] don't care about all the things that
[2:01:19] I've thought. I just want to be in line
[2:01:20] with that word of God." And it might
[2:01:23] upset families. It might upset friends.
[2:01:26] It might even upset churches. It doesn't
[2:01:28] matter because all of that is going to
[2:01:31] fade away. Only thing that will remain
[2:01:33] is the word of God.
[2:01:36] We have to remember the devil doesn't
[2:01:39] really care. He does. He wants to upset
[2:01:41] us everywhere he can. But all of those
[2:01:44] things that happen, brothers and
[2:01:45] sisters, are trials of our faith. Amen.
[2:01:48] When we encounter issues and problems in
[2:01:50] our life, they're trials of our faith.
[2:01:53] When we have that old nature, when the
[2:01:55] devil comes around and just pokes it and
[2:01:56] pokes it and pokes it over and over and
[2:01:59] over again, he's not trying to get us to
[2:02:02] just become succumb to that one nature.
[2:02:04] All he's doing is trying to get us to
[2:02:06] say, "Oh, you know what? I I just I just
[2:02:09] can't do it anyway. I might as well just
[2:02:10] go home. There's no point trying to
[2:02:12] serve God. I might as well just go
[2:02:14] fishing on a Sunday. I'd get more out of
[2:02:16] it." That's what the devil wants to
[2:02:18] hear. But the true believer is going to
[2:02:21] say, "You know what? I might not be
[2:02:22] getting much out of a service, but I'm
[2:02:24] going to go and pull on the word of God
[2:02:25] and say amen and cause that preacher to
[2:02:27] preach something that's going to feed my
[2:02:29] soul
[2:02:31] because I want to line up with the word
[2:02:33] of God." Yes.
[2:02:35] Doesn't matter who's preaching. That's
[2:02:37] right. It's the trials of our faith,
[2:02:39] brothers and
[2:02:41] sisters. And it comes a point where we
[2:02:43] receive the end of our our faith when we
[2:02:45] say, you know, I'm just going to get
[2:02:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:47] Christ. I I I have faith that believed
[2:02:50] that I am entitled to the Holy Ghost
[2:02:52] according to what everyone else says.
[2:02:54] All the millions and billions of people
[2:02:55] out there and the denominations, they
[2:02:57] say you can get baptized in the name of
[2:02:58] the Father, the name of the Son, the
[2:03:00] name of the Holy Ghost, and get the gift
[2:03:01] of the Holy Ghost. And because they're
[2:03:02] all saying it, it's cool and it's going
[2:03:06] to happen. Just because everyone says it
[2:03:08] doesn't mean it's
[2:03:10] right. And you know, I'll say this. Take
[2:03:13] a look at this whole transgenderism
[2:03:16] thing.
[2:03:19] I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't say it,
[2:03:21] but I'm going to. Men that want to go
[2:03:23] and play in women's sport, why do they
[2:03:26] want to do
[2:03:27] that? Because they can't compete against
[2:03:29] their own. That's right.
[2:03:32] I'll say it. Because they're losers,
[2:03:36] so now they want to go and be winners.
[2:03:38] So they're going to cheat to do it.
[2:03:40] Amen. Just because everyone's doing it
[2:03:43] doesn't mean it's right.
[2:03:45] Just because they want to indoctrinate
[2:03:47] our children, it doesn't mean it's
[2:03:49] right. just because they've taken and
[2:03:53] made the
[2:03:54] LGBTQ part of Canadian
[2:03:57] law to say it's a human rights violation
[2:04:00] to say anything against it, it doesn't
[2:04:03] mean it's right according to the word of
[2:04:06] God.
[2:04:08] And you can see the lines are starting
[2:04:12] to converge and they're getting closer
[2:04:14] and closer and closer.
[2:04:17] The beautiful thing is ain't nobody
[2:04:18] going to stop this word. Doesn't matter
[2:04:21] what government, doesn't matter what
[2:04:23] police, doesn't matter any of that.
[2:04:26] But just because everyone's doing it
[2:04:28] doesn't mean it's right. Just because
[2:04:30] God allows it to happen and everyone is
[2:04:33] doing it doesn't mean it's right.
[2:04:36] Exactly.
[2:04:41] He's going to keep allowing us to be
[2:04:42] molded and shaped until he sees his
[2:04:44] character in our lives. Amen.
[2:04:46] Hallelujah. And you
[2:04:48] know, I'll say it this way, too. I think
[2:04:50] it's important, brothers and
[2:04:52] sisters. Humanly speaking, sadly,
[2:04:55] especially when he sees his character,
[2:04:58] he's going to allow the trials to come.
[2:05:00] Remember, Job had a hedge planted about
[2:05:03] him. But God had to say to Satan, "Have
[2:05:06] you considered my servant Job down
[2:05:08] there? Have you considered him? Because
[2:05:11] he actually will never curse me." And
[2:05:14] Satan said, "Oh, yeah. I could get him
[2:05:15] to curse you, but you've got him
[2:05:16] protected. You got a hedge around him.
[2:05:18] He's got everything. Everything is good
[2:05:20] in his life. His family, all his family
[2:05:21] serves the Lord. You make intercessions
[2:05:23] for children. Everything is good in his
[2:05:28] life. But God said, "You know what? You
[2:05:30] can go and do what you want. You will
[2:05:31] never be able to get him to curse me to
[2:05:33] my face."
[2:05:35] I don't think that Job is
[2:05:37] exclusive. Every single one of us, you
[2:05:40] know, we've preached it so many times.
[2:05:41] God has a counsel in heaven for every
[2:05:43] single human being on earth,
[2:05:46] especially his children, have you
[2:05:48] considered my servant? When we have the
[2:05:50] trials in our lives, brothers and
[2:05:51] sisters, remember that. Have you
[2:05:54] considered my
[2:05:56] servant? Because he's allowing it to
[2:05:58] happen. And the more it happens, the
[2:06:00] more what are we supposed to do? Get sad
[2:06:03] and sit down and and stagger and stop
[2:06:06] coming to church because I've got these
[2:06:07] trials in my life? No, we're supposed to
[2:06:11] rejoice
[2:06:13] at the trials of our faith. We're
[2:06:15] supposed to give him praise. The more
[2:06:17] the trials come, the more we praise. If
[2:06:19] you want to see a trial go away, praise
[2:06:21] him.
[2:06:23] We've got every single reason to praise
[2:06:25] him. To have ears to hear what the
[2:06:27] spirit says to the church. My goodness.
[2:06:30] 1963, God hiding himself in
[2:06:33] simplicity. He says, "How many more in
[2:06:35] here wants the Holy Ghost? Let me see
[2:06:38] your hand." I was reading this and I was
[2:06:40] thinking as I was studying, if we ask
[2:06:42] that question here, would people get
[2:06:43] offended? Would people get upset and
[2:06:46] uncomfortable?
[2:06:48] If if that's the case, then I feel like
[2:06:50] there's a problem. I really do. I know
[2:06:53] the the great revival is over and that's
[2:06:55] where Brother Brandham was preaching.
[2:06:57] But you know, brothers and sisters, we
[2:06:58] either have the Holy Ghost or we don't
[2:07:00] have the Holy Ghost. And and and this is
[2:07:03] important. This is the most important
[2:07:04] doctrine there is to talk about and that
[2:07:07] is to get the Holy Ghost in our lives.
[2:07:08] But he says this here. How many more in
[2:07:10] here wants the Holy Ghost? Let me see
[2:07:12] your hand. How many? 1 2 3 4. Oh my. No.
[2:07:16] No need of going without it. There's
[2:07:18] eight or 10 here. 11. Maybe 11 12 maybe
[2:07:20] in here needs the Holy Ghost yet. I know
[2:07:23] we may be running late, but 9:30 or
[2:07:26] something like that. But but we got
[2:07:28] plenty of time. We just got plenty of
[2:07:30] time. We want you saved, friend. We want
[2:07:33] you filled. I can't help but think,
[2:07:36] brothers and sisters, if if we ask the
[2:07:38] question, how many here want the Holy
[2:07:39] Ghost? There's potentially hands that
[2:07:40] would go up. There is a process to go
[2:07:42] through getting the Holy Ghost in your
[2:07:44] life. That's to repent for your sins and
[2:07:46] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:07:47] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[2:07:49] sins. And you shall receive the gift of
[2:07:51] the Holy Ghost. That's the word of God.
[2:07:52] That's the promise. It's a free promise
[2:07:54] that will give you the ability to
[2:07:56] understand what all this noise about the
[2:07:58] message is about. Amen. It will give us
[2:08:01] the ability to go on to a theophony body
[2:08:04] in heaven if we're willing to actually
[2:08:06] humble ourselves to the word of God for
[2:08:08] the day in which we live. But I want to
[2:08:10] ask the question myself, and I'm not
[2:08:12] looking for hands. I'm looking for
[2:08:13] hearts, brothers and sisters. How many
[2:08:15] here would like a a new filling of the
[2:08:17] Holy Ghost? How many here would just
[2:08:19] like to raise your cup to the Lord and
[2:08:21] say, "Lord, I know I've got it, but I
[2:08:23] need more." Amen. Remember the
[2:08:26] difference between the five wise and the
[2:08:28] five unwise. They all had lamps. They
[2:08:30] all were virgins. They all slumbered and
[2:08:32] slept. Right? But only five of them had
[2:08:35] enough oil. They all had oil.
[2:08:39] When the time came to rise and trim your
[2:08:41] lamps, only five could do it because
[2:08:43] they had oil. I can't help but think
[2:08:45] that's the value in going to church and
[2:08:47] being a part of a body, local body,
[2:08:49] where you could go and change the chorus
[2:08:52] of the service because of the need in
[2:08:54] your heart and see God come on the scene
[2:08:56] and speak directly to us. He says
[2:08:59] there's eight or 10 here, 11 about 11,
[2:09:02] 12 maybe in here needs the Holy Ghost
[2:09:05] yet. Amen. I'll call the
[2:09:09] musicians. Let I know we may be running
[2:09:13] late. maybe 9:30 or something like that,
[2:09:15] but we got we just got plenty of time.
[2:09:17] We just got plenty of time. We want you
[2:09:20] saved, friend. We want you filled. And I
[2:09:23] can't help but think that's the same
[2:09:24] thing today. Remember, you are you are
[2:09:27] saved. Of course, when you accept
[2:09:30] Christ, you're not saved,
[2:09:34] but you're you're saved. Yes. When you
[2:09:36] accept Christ, you're saved, but you're
[2:09:39] not converted until you receive the Holy
[2:09:42] Ghost.
[2:09:44] That's right. Now, you know that. That's
[2:09:46] right. Amen. And he goes on to talk
[2:09:49] about Peter. Jesus told Peter the night
[2:09:52] of the
[2:09:53] betrayal, Peter is the one that took off
[2:09:55] the ear of the
[2:09:57] servant and Jesus had to go and heal
[2:10:00] him. He didn't have to, but he did
[2:10:03] because he knew that everything had to
[2:10:06] be exactly right. There couldn't be one
[2:10:09] thing that was said about Jesus that he
[2:10:11] actually did to any human being except
[2:10:14] for preach the truth. And if he wouldn't
[2:10:16] have picked up that ear and put it back
[2:10:17] on, they would have been able to hang
[2:10:18] that on him. But what did he do one more
[2:10:21] time? He actually demonstrated the love
[2:10:23] that he had for humanity. And he picked
[2:10:25] up that ear and he put it back on and
[2:10:26] said, "Peter, put away the sword. If you
[2:10:28] live by the sword, you're going to die
[2:10:30] by the
[2:10:31] sword. Peter, the rock, the one who was
[2:10:34] so fervent for the Lord, even though he
[2:10:37] was saved, he wasn't
[2:10:40] converted. I'm just going to pause
[2:10:42] there, brothers and sisters. Even though
[2:10:43] he was saved, he wasn't
[2:10:46] converted. How many of us here today are
[2:10:49] saved, but not
[2:10:51] converted? I'm not trying to be hard,
[2:10:54] brothers and sisters. What I'm saying is
[2:10:55] this is the time to not play. This is
[2:10:58] time to understand where we stand.
[2:11:02] We might not even be able to get home
[2:11:04] today and the rapture happens.
[2:11:10] Jesus told Peter the night of the
[2:11:11] betrayal, he was already saved. Said,
[2:11:14] "Now after you are converted, strengthen
[2:11:17] your brethren." That's right. Oh, sure.
[2:11:20] You accepted Christ as your savior. But
[2:11:22] when you're
[2:11:24] converted, that's when you're really
[2:11:26] changed. I say, "Lord, if I haven't been
[2:11:29] converted yet, then convert me, Lord. I
[2:11:32] don't want to just put this on anybody
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:36] else." That's right. He wasn't changed
[2:11:39] yet. He cursed before the Lord and
[2:11:42] denied him and everything. But after his
[2:11:46] conversion, after thou art converted,
[2:11:49] strengthen your brethren. That's right.
[2:11:50] Is that
[2:11:52] right? That's what the scripture says.
[2:11:55] Anyhow, that makes it right.
[2:11:59] Jesus told Peter that had followed him
[2:12:02] and cast out devils and done miracles
[2:12:05] and everything said, "You're not
[2:12:09] converted yet."
[2:12:11] Can you believe
[2:12:12] that? He cast out devils. They had
[2:12:16] tremendous song services. They had
[2:12:19] tremendous healing campaigns. They did.
[2:12:22] They had a tremendous following. People
[2:12:24] were so they did much better because
[2:12:27] they were followers, right? But how many
[2:12:30] actually got converted? How many truly
[2:12:32] went on to the baptism of the Holy
[2:12:34] Ghost? How many thousands were
[2:12:37] converted? Or how many thousands were
[2:12:39] saved rather, but how many were
[2:12:41] converted in the upper room? Only
[2:12:47] 120. Brother Brandham says that's what
[2:12:49] the scripture says. Anyhow, that makes
[2:12:51] it right. Maybe stand with me as we
[2:12:53] close.
[2:12:54] That makes it right. Jesus told Peter
[2:12:57] that had followed him and cast out
[2:12:59] devils and done miracles and everything
[2:13:01] said, "You're not converted yet, but
[2:13:03] after you're converted, then strengthen
[2:13:04] your brethren."
[2:13:07] Right? It's
[2:13:09] true. Now, why don't we just go a little
[2:13:12] further ourselves? I just can't help but
[2:13:15] think about going beyond the camp. Let's
[2:13:16] just go beyond the camp of our thinking.
[2:13:19] Amen. And just allow the Lord to
[2:13:21] minister to us. If we've got the Holy
[2:13:23] Ghost, let's just ask for a little bit
[2:13:25] more. And and I would say this, I'm not
[2:13:28] going to ask for a a a list of hands.
[2:13:31] Let's just close our eyes and bow our
[2:13:33] heads. This is a private
[2:13:36] affair. How many here today would desire
[2:13:40] more of the Holy Ghost in their lives?
[2:13:44] I'm sure that all of the believers,
[2:13:46] every single hand would go up.
[2:13:51] And some here today, they might desire
[2:13:53] the Holy Ghost at all.
[2:13:58] I believe it. If you truly desire the
[2:14:00] Holy Ghost in your life, he is more than
[2:14:04] willing to give it to you. And all you
[2:14:07] have to do is be sincere
[2:14:09] and he will give you his Holy Spirit.
[2:14:12] And and when he does, you will come
[2:14:14] according to the word of God.
[2:14:18] It's such a beautiful thing. Let's just
[2:14:21] pray. Heavenly Father, this morning,
[2:14:24] we're so thankful for your word, Lord.
[2:14:26] We're so thankful that you would send us
[2:14:28] a vindicated prophet, Lord, in the day
[2:14:30] in which we live, Lord, the signs and
[2:14:33] the wonders. But how he pointed back to
[2:14:36] your word and said, "Get back in line.
[2:14:39] Get back to the word of God. Help us,
[2:14:41] Lord, not to try and make
[2:14:43] excuses for our lives, Lord.
[2:14:47] We know that you have given us the the
[2:14:49] wedding band of unmmerited grace, Lord
[2:14:53] Jesus. The ability to to to say, "I do."
[2:14:56] and and and allow it to be put on our
[2:14:58] our finger, Lord Jesus, where we
[2:15:00] demonstrate that we are yours.
[2:15:03] Father, this morning I pray that if
[2:15:05] there's anybody here that that Lord
[2:15:07] Jesus sincerely desires the true baptism
[2:15:10] of the Holy Ghost, that you would grant
[2:15:13] it to them in the name of Jesus
[2:15:16] Christ. And Father, for anyone else here
[2:15:19] this morning, Lord, that would desire to
[2:15:21] have more of you, Father, more of your
[2:15:25] Holy Spirit in their life, Lord, I pray
[2:15:27] that you would grant it to them, Lord
[2:15:29] Jesus. Father, we know that you're more
[2:15:31] than able to. We know that time is
[2:15:34] short. We don't know how many more days
[2:15:36] we have
[2:15:37] here. But help us Lord as we go forwards
[2:15:40] to
[2:15:41] acknowledge you to acknowledge that you
[2:15:45] are the same yesterday, today and
[2:15:46] forever. And that Lord, help us not to
[2:15:50] chase a prophet and signs and wonders.
[2:15:52] Let us chase you. Let our hearts be
[2:15:56] about your business, Lord.
[2:16:00] And we know, Father, that you will bless
[2:16:02] us. Lord, we're so thankful that you
[2:16:04] have given us ears to hear what your
[2:16:06] spirit says. Father, we pray that you
[2:16:09] would just bless us as we go our
[2:16:11] separate ways. Lord, be with those who
[2:16:13] are laboring in your field, Lord. The
[2:16:15] brethren in Lethbridge, what a
[2:16:18] tremendous thing they're doing, Lord.
[2:16:19] Reaching out and trying to find the last
[2:16:23] predestinated seeds in Lethbridge, Lord.
[2:16:26] Not just taking it, oh father, for
[2:16:28] granted that the people will come, but
[2:16:30] going out and truly witnessing your
[2:16:32] life, asking if they need prayer. What a
[2:16:36] blessing. Bless the brethren, Father,
[2:16:38] abundantly above all they could ask or
[2:16:40] think, Lord
[2:16:41] Jesus. Father, we just ask, Lord, also
[2:16:44] that you would just keep your hand upon
[2:16:46] those who aren't here today for whatever
[2:16:48] reason. Maybe traveling for work, Lord.
[2:16:51] Maybe visiting a different city with the
[2:16:53] believers. maybe at home sick. Father,
[2:16:56] we pray that you would just pour your
[2:16:59] spirit out upon them, Lord Jesus. Grant
[2:17:01] them, Lord Jesus, the true desire of
[2:17:04] their hearts.
[2:17:07] Father, we'll be careful to give you all
[2:17:08] the praise. Lord, we love you and we
[2:17:11] thank you. We just want to commit each
[2:17:12] life, each soul into your hands now for
[2:17:15] your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:17:18] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:17:24] Can we sing
[2:17:26] 488? The great emancipator.
[2:17:36] I'll just need a little heart help to
[2:17:37] start.
