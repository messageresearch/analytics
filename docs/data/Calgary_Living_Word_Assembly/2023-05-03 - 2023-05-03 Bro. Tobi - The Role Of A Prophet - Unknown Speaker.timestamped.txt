[43:32] father we know that are coming to church
[43:34] Lord is never in vain
[43:37] because we see changes in our lives
[43:40] we know that this word Lord Jesus eyes
[43:42] affecting our lives dear Lord
[43:45] and Lord sometimes it might feel like we
[43:48] had to drag ourselves to church
[43:51] but Lord we know Lord someday it will be
[43:55] worth it all therefore
[43:57] when we will see your face dear Lord

[45:14] tonight
[45:15] amen amen
[45:17] the blessing musicians bless you let's
[45:20] quickly read from
[45:22] second Peter chapter one
[45:28] second Peter chapter one I'll just take
[45:30] a verse verse 16.
[45:34] and then we will be seated
[45:40] second Peter chapter one is one of my
[45:42] favorites
[45:43] scriptures in the Bible
[45:47] just because he talks a lot about
[45:49] us
[45:52] verse 16 says for we have not followed
[45:55] cunningly devised Fables
[45:58] when we made known unto you the power
[46:01] and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:04] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty may
[46:09] the Lord bless the Ring of his word may
[46:11] you you may have your seat tonight
[46:16] so tonight by the grace of God is a
[46:19] Wednesday night
[46:21] church is a bit half full but
[46:24] quite full for Wednesday night so thank
[46:26] you all for coming
[46:27] tonight by the grace of God I want to
[46:30] speak on the role of a prophet in God's
[46:33] economy
[46:35] the role of a prophet in God's economy
[46:39] and um
[46:41] you know
[46:44] I was going to continue the thought I
[46:47] had prior to Easter when I was talking
[46:50] about servants in acceptable service and
[46:52] I know I did the part two and I said
[46:54] there would be other parts to it
[46:56] but when a pastor
[46:58] um called me and asked if I could take
[47:00] the service
[47:01] this had been on my heart
[47:04] and and I just feel the Lord impressed
[47:06] this in my heart to to speak about this
[47:09] and the sermon tonight might sound like
[47:12] you know
[47:13] um speaking to the choir as they say
[47:17] um but I'm reminded of the fact that the
[47:20] man that introduced Jesus Christ
[47:23] there was a time but the brand said that
[47:25] his eagle eyes got filmed over
[47:29] and his Saints his disciples to go ask
[47:31] Jesus
[47:33] are you the one
[47:34] or do we expect another
[47:37] and as we go on this journey especially
[47:40] with the pressure that we are facing
[47:44] there are times doubts might come into
[47:46] your heart
[47:48] about the prophet of the age
[47:54] you might be there it's not a bad thing
[47:56] to be there
[47:58] and I know that there might be people
[48:00] there tonight otherwise the Lord won't
[48:02] be sending this message to us
[48:04] it might be a Tiny Seed that's been sold
[48:07] in your heart because of something you
[48:09] read
[48:10] on the internet about the brand
[48:13] but what we want to do tonight by the
[48:15] grace of God time permitting
[48:18] is to go back to the Bible
[48:21] and understand why God sent prophets in
[48:25] Bible days and why God still sent a
[48:28] prophet today
[48:30] so we are alive from the beginning I
[48:32] always like to go to the beginning but
[48:33] the Brahm always likes to go to the
[48:34] beginning
[48:36] but let's just see how God started to
[48:38] speak with man the first man God created
[48:41] was Adam
[48:42] and out of Adam came Eve and we saw that
[48:46] God spoke to Adam directly it was like
[48:49] God came down but the Bible tell us he
[48:52] came down at the cool of the evening
[48:55] and he will have fellowship with them
[48:58] they could fellowship with God remember
[49:00] at that time there was no sin so there
[49:02] was nothing that was hindering God from
[49:05] fellowshipping with people because the
[49:07] Bible said God cannot behold sin
[49:10] now when sin came
[49:13] and by the sin that came
[49:16] you know Eve gave birth to the seed of
[49:18] the serpents and then the seed of Adam
[49:21] and the seed of the serpents which we
[49:23] know was Cain killed I'm sorry Abel
[49:26] killed Abel we found that God even still
[49:29] spoke to Cain
[49:32] directly and said to him if you will do
[49:36] what your brother has done then I will
[49:38] accept your sacrifice
[49:41] then we realize that as time went by
[49:44] there was another man in the Bible
[49:45] called Enoch the seventh from Adam
[49:49] and the Bible said he walked with God
[49:51] and was raptured
[49:53] but if you search the scripture Enoch
[49:56] was the first person that was referred
[49:59] to as a prophet
[50:01] it wasn't referred to as a prophet of
[50:03] the Book of Genesis but if you go to
[50:04] Jude Jude talked about Enoch being a
[50:08] prophet and prophesying
[50:11] now later on after Enoch was Noah
[50:15] and Noah the Bible said they found grace
[50:18] before the eyes of God
[50:20] and Noah was the first man that God will
[50:23] send with a message
[50:26] to the people of the Earth
[50:28] to tell them that destruction was coming
[50:32] and after Noah came Abraham why am I
[50:35] going through this I'm trying to let you
[50:36] understand that there was a time that
[50:39] God was speaking to man directly and
[50:42] then he transitioned to God speaking to
[50:44] men so that that man can go and speak to
[50:46] others on behalf of God
[50:49] when God started to deal with Abraham
[50:54] we know that God called him out from his
[50:57] Kindred from his people
[50:59] and God gave him a promise told him to
[51:02] move somewhere else and God gave him a
[51:03] promise of a child but we realized that
[51:06] as God was speaking to Abraham directly
[51:09] at some point God said about Abraham I
[51:13] know that he will command his household
[51:17] his children after him why God had
[51:20] spoken to Abraham but God expected
[51:23] Abraham to pass on the message to his
[51:26] family
[51:27] his household the servants that he had
[51:32] and then then came Isaac
[51:36] and God spoke directly to Isaac
[51:39] and later on came Jacob and God spoke
[51:42] directly to Jacob
[51:44] and all those people brother will tell
[51:46] us Isaac was a prophet
[51:48] because Isaac
[51:51] LeBron said that when Esau came so when
[51:54] Jacob came and and and you know tried to
[51:57] deceive him but Abraham said he was
[51:58] trying to deceive is is his father who
[52:02] was a prophet
[52:03] now Jacob as well also experienced that
[52:07] hearing from God we know what he was you
[52:10] know living fleeing from his brother he
[52:12] saw the vision of heaven so Angels
[52:15] ascending and descending but we also
[52:17] know that when he was with his um his
[52:20] uncle who became his father-in-law God
[52:22] also spoke directly to him
[52:25] and later on then came
[52:28] Joseph
[52:29] one of his sons he was a dreamer
[52:33] and we realized that God also spoke to
[52:36] Joseph
[52:37] because when Joseph got to Egypt and he
[52:40] had to interpret the dream
[52:43] of pharaoh we realized that it's only a
[52:47] prophet that can interpret a dream
[52:50] I'm giving some background here but
[52:51] we'll we'll keep going
[52:54] then it got to a time when God wanted to
[52:57] take out his people from Egypt
[53:00] and then he sent them of prophets
[53:03] so Moses was the first messenger to what
[53:07] we'll call a church well Abraham said
[53:09] the church is called out people
[53:12] and when God sent Moses God spoke to
[53:15] Moses as a matter of fact God started
[53:17] speaking to Moses Moses was going back
[53:20] to the people to tell them what God Said
[53:22] but he got to a Time the people said we
[53:24] wanted to hear from God ourselves would
[53:27] like to hear directly from God
[53:29] and God said well they don't like my
[53:31] pattern
[53:32] so here's what I'm going to do tell them
[53:34] to concentrate concentrate themselves
[53:37] I get those two words mixed together
[53:39] sometimes
[53:41] tell them to
[53:43] consecrate themselves that's the right
[53:46] word
[53:48] because God cannot behold anything
[53:51] that's evil
[53:52] so they had to stay away from their
[53:54] wives they had to clean up themselves
[53:56] they had to clean up okay I won't go
[53:59] there tonight
[54:00] um they had to clean up because God's
[54:03] presence was coming
[54:04] right and when God came
[54:08] the way God came they could not take it
[54:12] they couldn't take the founder Reigns
[54:14] and the Lightnings they realized that
[54:17] when God comes down in his power
[54:20] an ordinary man cannot handle it
[54:23] so the people themselves for the first
[54:25] time said we are not going to hear
[54:29] directly from God
[54:30] let God speak to Moses
[54:33] and then Moses come tell us what God has
[54:37] said
[54:39] now we know that God then sent Joshua
[54:41] after God took Moses
[54:43] and he also had an encounter with the
[54:46] captain of the host of the Lord who told
[54:48] him what they needed to do and then he
[54:50] was able to tell that to the people
[54:53] why are we saying all of this
[54:56] some people in the world
[54:59] think that as Christians the expectation
[55:02] is that we take the Bible we read it we
[55:06] understand it by ourselves and based on
[55:09] that we do what he says
[55:13] it is more than that
[55:16] I've had recent conversations where
[55:18] someone will say oh I've read the Bible
[55:20] and I don't see why it is wrong to do
[55:23] this
[55:26] now this is
[55:30] something that you might not know
[55:33] from what people have said there are
[55:35] about 45
[55:37] 000 Christian denominations
[55:40] around the world today
[55:42] meaning that there are 45
[55:45] 000 different ideas of what the Bible
[55:48] has said
[55:50] now there was a time in the time of
[55:53] Moses I have scriptures to read
[55:55] Deuteronomy chapter 12 might not be able
[55:58] to read all of that because the long
[55:59] read but I'll just talk about it
[56:01] but we'll find that God through Moses
[56:04] was warning the people and telling them
[56:07] don't get to a point where you want to
[56:10] do what is right in your own eyes
[56:15] he didn't say what was wrong
[56:17] what is right in your own eyes that's
[56:21] your understanding of what Moses has
[56:24] said
[56:26] or your understanding of what God
[56:28] expects you've got to take what Moses
[56:32] the servant of the Lord brought to you
[56:34] as instructions from the Lord
[56:37] now we got to a Time
[56:39] when we know you know Moses was there
[56:41] Joshua was dead
[56:43] and the Bible told us
[56:45] that in the days of the judges
[56:50] judges 17 6 says in those days there was
[56:53] no king in Israel
[56:55] but every man did that which was right
[56:59] in his own eyes
[57:02] it was a time of trouble
[57:05] people were doing what was right in
[57:07] their eyes people will just try to
[57:09] remember what exactly did did their
[57:11] fathers tell us that Moses said maybe
[57:13] some of them will go to the to the Ten
[57:14] Commandments some will read it some will
[57:16] say some part mattered some will say
[57:19] some part don't matter
[57:22] they did what was right in their eyes
[57:25] and the Bible said because there was no
[57:27] king in Israel
[57:29] now we might think that that King that
[57:31] the Bible is referring to is a physical
[57:34] King
[57:37] so the Book of Judges after the Book of
[57:39] Judges any of the kids can tell me what
[57:41] book is next after judges was what
[57:45] you can tell me
[57:47] sorry
[57:50] after judges was
[57:52] Ruth thanks thanks Elias that's correct
[57:55] but the happiness and the time of rules
[57:59] was also part of the time of the judges
[58:04] so if you go to the Book of Ruth it
[58:05] tells us that in the time of the judges
[58:08] this story happened
[58:10] right so right after the time of the
[58:13] judges when the Bible told us that there
[58:16] was no king in Israel and every man did
[58:19] that which was right in his own eyes
[58:20] what was the solution that God gave
[58:25] after the Book of Ruth was what
[58:28] first Samuel
[58:30] so when every man did what was right in
[58:32] their eyes God did not give them a king
[58:35] God gave them a prophet
[58:40] why because the word of the Lord comes
[58:43] to the prophet
[58:46] so they are gone away from the prophet
[58:48] Moses
[58:50] and then God was restoring them back he
[58:53] willing to restore them back to his word
[58:55] he sent them a Prophets
[58:57] now the children of Israel because God
[59:00] also told him
[59:01] now these nations that that have given
[59:05] you their land I'm not going to utterly
[59:06] take them away
[59:08] all at once because I'm going to leave
[59:10] them there so they can be a snare to you
[59:12] to prove you whether you're going to
[59:15] serve me or not
[59:17] so Israel started to look at those
[59:19] Nations they saw that those nations are
[59:22] the king each of them had Kings and
[59:25] based on that Israel also wanted to
[59:27] patent themselves after those Nations
[59:30] and when they went to Samwell the
[59:33] prophet and said we want a king over us
[59:36] the first thing Samuel said to God is
[59:38] they have rejected me because Samuel
[59:41] understood that in God's economy the
[59:45] role of a prophet is the leader
[59:49] not a king
[59:51] and God told him it is not you they have
[59:54] rejected they have rejected me because
[59:57] the word that is coming from your mouth
[59:59] it does said the Lord so the prophet is
[1:00:02] only there to represent
[1:00:07] God himself
[1:00:13] so one of the things that God did for
[1:00:17] Israel
[1:00:18] to make them because the next question
[1:00:20] is if God speaks to us by prophets and
[1:00:25] how do we tell
[1:00:26] which is right which is true and which
[1:00:29] is false because Jesus also said that
[1:00:31] false prophets are going to arise
[1:00:34] and this was not a conversation that
[1:00:37] first happened when Jesus was here God
[1:00:40] had already told them through Moses that
[1:00:42] there will be there will be prophets
[1:00:44] that will come that will want to lead
[1:00:46] you away from me so God gave them three
[1:00:48] things
[1:00:49] I'll call them the
[1:00:51] the formula for validating the often
[1:00:55] series tcd sorry offense TCT of a
[1:01:00] prophet I know what's happening to my
[1:01:02] English tonight
[1:01:03] anyway shall I speak in tongues
[1:01:07] not everyone will understand
[1:01:10] so the first thing God said is
[1:01:13] that if God sends a Prophets
[1:01:16] God will speak
[1:01:18] so that man
[1:01:20] envisions and in dreams
[1:01:23] so what I want to do tonight is take
[1:01:25] this three
[1:01:26] and bring brother Brahm
[1:01:29] side by side with this and ask ourselves
[1:01:32] that based on God's Own formula for
[1:01:36] determining who a prophet is did Brother
[1:01:40] Graham meet this criteria
[1:01:44] do we understand
[1:01:45] amen so Numbers chapter 12 verse 6.
[1:01:52] and he said hear now my words
[1:01:56] if there be a prophet among you
[1:01:59] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[1:02:02] him in a vision
[1:02:04] and will speak unto him in a dream
[1:02:08] now two things I'll make myself known to
[1:02:12] him in the vision
[1:02:14] and I will speak to him in a dream
[1:02:18] now
[1:02:20] one of the Apostles which we know was
[1:02:22] the messenger to the Gentiles Apostle
[1:02:25] Paul
[1:02:27] he never introduced himself as a prophet
[1:02:31] but we know he was a prophet because he
[1:02:34] saw visions
[1:02:36] and he told us about seeing a vision of
[1:02:39] going to heaven
[1:02:41] now I want to read World brother Brahms
[1:02:42] said about dreams and visions
[1:02:45] because we as humans most of us have
[1:02:48] dreams most of us go to sleep and we
[1:02:51] dream
[1:02:52] but vision is entirely different
[1:02:55] and brother Brown being someone that saw
[1:02:58] hundreds of thousands of visions
[1:03:01] he explains to us what that is so first
[1:03:05] thing God speaks to a prophet through
[1:03:07] visions and dreams the brother said in
[1:03:10] the message is this the sign of the
[1:03:12] answer Brothers if you can find it
[1:03:14] 1962 12 30
[1:03:17] evening
[1:03:19] paragraph 192.
[1:03:22] he said there is there is difference
[1:03:24] between dreams and Visions dreams is
[1:03:26] when you go to sleep Visions when you
[1:03:29] don't go to sleep
[1:03:31] we are born that way he's talking about
[1:03:33] prophets prophets are born that way the
[1:03:36] ordinary human being when it dreams it
[1:03:39] is in his subconscious
[1:03:43] and his subconscious is way away from
[1:03:46] him
[1:03:47] his senses is active as long as he is in
[1:03:52] his first conscious our first conscious
[1:03:54] is our actual Consciousness when we move
[1:03:57] around every day
[1:03:58] in this conscious you you're a normal
[1:04:02] you see
[1:04:03] taste fill smell or hear
[1:04:06] but there's something when you dream
[1:04:08] that you return back to this conscious
[1:04:12] so we move away from our Consciousness
[1:04:15] to our subconsciousness when we go to
[1:04:16] sleep and that's when dreams happen
[1:04:19] there is a memory
[1:04:21] that you remember something that you
[1:04:24] dreamed about even years ago
[1:04:26] the ordinary human being is that way
[1:04:30] but when God predestinates something
[1:04:33] this subconscious is not way away from
[1:04:38] here to The Seer The Seer is the same as
[1:04:41] a prophet
[1:04:42] but what Consciousness is right together
[1:04:48] and the Syria in a vision doesn't go to
[1:04:51] sleep
[1:04:53] is still in his senses
[1:04:55] and sees it
[1:04:58] so imagine dreaming without going to
[1:05:00] sleep that is what a vision is
[1:05:04] the Bible said I was explaining that for
[1:05:06] some doctors the other day and they
[1:05:08] raised up and sent marvelous never even
[1:05:10] thought of such a thing
[1:05:12] when I was taken a wave test
[1:05:15] and they said they said
[1:05:17] they had never seen anything like that
[1:05:20] see well said there is something happens
[1:05:22] to you the doctor was standing by the
[1:05:24] brand and I said
[1:05:26] I told it he said that's that's it
[1:05:28] exactly seed the two consciouses sit
[1:05:32] right close together in the case of the
[1:05:34] Bram is consciousness and his
[1:05:37] subconscious we're very close together
[1:05:40] it's nothing I could do
[1:05:43] and they don't make me know more than
[1:05:44] anybody else what a humble man
[1:05:47] it's just God made it that way
[1:05:51] you don't go to sleep
[1:05:54] you're right here just like asleep
[1:05:56] you're standing here looking out like
[1:05:58] this and all of you have seen it around
[1:06:01] the world you don't go to sleep standing
[1:06:03] here on the platform talking to people
[1:06:05] you hear me going to visions and come
[1:06:07] back when I'm riding on a car with you
[1:06:09] anywhere else and tell you things that's
[1:06:12] going to happen and never fails
[1:06:16] as never
[1:06:18] has anybody ever seen it fail
[1:06:20] they said congregation says no
[1:06:24] no sir it can't fail it would feel as
[1:06:28] long as it's god notice right on the
[1:06:30] platform thousands before tens of
[1:06:33] thousands of people living in other
[1:06:35] languages that I can't even speak
[1:06:39] till you don't feel see it's God
[1:06:44] so to be called a prophet
[1:06:47] it must be someone that God speaks to
[1:06:49] envisions
[1:06:51] and dreams like I said we as humans who
[1:06:54] will dream many times but we have to go
[1:06:57] to sleep before we dream but humans who
[1:07:01] are called to be prophets and Abraham
[1:07:02] told us the prophets are born to be
[1:07:04] Prophets
[1:07:05] they don't go to sleep before
[1:07:09] um they see a vision before they dream
[1:07:11] is almost like dreaming and there are
[1:07:13] people that God will speak to through
[1:07:16] dreams that are still not Prophets
[1:07:19] so Joseph the husband of Mary the Bible
[1:07:21] never recorded that it was a prophet but
[1:07:24] the angel of the Lord came to him in a
[1:07:27] dream
[1:07:29] right just to kind of give us that
[1:07:31] difference but if you if he's a prophet
[1:07:34] God will speak to that man through
[1:07:38] dreams and visions
[1:07:40] and I said before a prophets when a
[1:07:44] prophet interprets a dream but the Brahm
[1:07:46] said that that Prophet sees the vision
[1:07:48] of that dream first and see the vision
[1:07:51] of the interpretation and he's able to
[1:07:53] tell that that's what happened with
[1:07:55] Daniel in the Book of Daniel when the
[1:07:57] king came to him and and came told all
[1:08:01] this princes like I will not tell you
[1:08:02] the dream
[1:08:04] you tell me my dream and tell me the
[1:08:06] interpretation
[1:08:07] that's who prophets are
[1:08:09] so we know that God sent us a prophet
[1:08:13] because we can see
[1:08:16] from all these recordings
[1:08:19] that's
[1:08:20] we have it's amazing you know you play
[1:08:24] tape and it is just there it's sometimes
[1:08:27] I'm driving on the car I'm listening to
[1:08:29] it and
[1:08:30] and you get to the discernment and
[1:08:32] you're like
[1:08:33] this could only have been God
[1:08:37] let me read a few a few to us tonight
[1:08:42] the infallible word of God preached in
[1:08:44] 1956 but Abraham was in the prayer line
[1:08:46] but the RAM says that man is a stranger
[1:08:50] I don't know him
[1:08:52] Christ does
[1:08:54] but sir I see your shadowed
[1:08:57] there's a Darkness
[1:08:59] I see them taking you into a building
[1:09:03] it's a hospital
[1:09:05] then you had an operation
[1:09:09] then you had another operation
[1:09:12] and they were for cancer
[1:09:14] and the cancer remained
[1:09:17] the doctor has failed to get it but he
[1:09:21] can't hide from Jesus
[1:09:26] you're not from this city
[1:09:28] you are from a smaller city than this
[1:09:32] it's Rockford Illinois it's where you're
[1:09:35] from and your name is Leonard I believe
[1:09:38] they call you and your address is 30 34
[1:09:42] 8th Street
[1:09:46] now I say this because you had Faith
[1:09:48] you're shadowed with death do you
[1:09:51] believe that Jesus Christ stands here
[1:09:54] he knowed how to call Kevin speeder you
[1:09:57] believe it then there's some kind of a
[1:10:00] spirit got me anointed
[1:10:02] do you believe it to be the son of God
[1:10:05] come here
[1:10:07] oh Jesus Son of God let thy Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] move into this man and heal him and may
[1:10:12] his life be spirit
[1:10:14] and I condemn the devil that's killing
[1:10:16] him may it leave him this night and may
[1:10:19] he get well go home and be happy and eat
[1:10:23] and leave in Jesus name I pray amen
[1:10:29] there's another one I want to read for
[1:10:31] the ram
[1:10:32] the prayer line again
[1:10:34] message the called outs 1958
[1:10:38] said you believe
[1:10:40] you've had an operation and it's made
[1:10:43] you awful week

[1:10:47] weak and you're praying for somebody
[1:10:49] else a sister
[1:10:51] she has high blood pressure
[1:10:53] I see him put the thing from her hand
[1:10:56] that's right rather a strong man doctor
[1:10:59] she's got heart trouble she's also got
[1:11:01] heart trouble is listening like that and
[1:11:05] beating on her back he said I see he is
[1:11:09] not dreaming
[1:11:11] so to say he is actually active is it
[1:11:13] his Consciousness but God is showing him
[1:11:16] what happened before
[1:11:18] miles and miles away
[1:11:23] remember God said if there is a prophet
[1:11:26] among you and where I read it was
[1:11:28] actually
[1:11:29] you know when God had called Miriam
[1:11:31] and Aaron and told Moses to call them
[1:11:33] because they had spoken badly to Moses
[1:11:35] because of his wife
[1:11:37] and God started to tell them that
[1:11:41] when there's a prophet in the land I
[1:11:43] will speak to him in visions and in
[1:11:46] dreams
[1:11:47] and God went ahead to say see Moses is
[1:11:50] not just an ordinary prophet
[1:11:53] I speak to him mouth
[1:11:56] to is here
[1:11:58] and we know that that's the same with
[1:12:00] brother Brown
[1:12:01] why am I saying this tonight as we as we
[1:12:03] go on just to kind of kind of tell you
[1:12:05] where my
[1:12:07] emotions is coming from
[1:12:10] many times
[1:12:12] we see what brother Brown said
[1:12:15] and sometimes we think it's a suggestion
[1:12:21] it's not
[1:12:25] that is the will of God for our life
[1:12:31] we have got to realize that when God
[1:12:33] sends a prophet
[1:12:35] it's it's not it's not just like any
[1:12:37] other preacher
[1:12:39] we'll go together but but even most of
[1:12:42] the people that I've written
[1:12:45] I'm just reading something this morning
[1:12:46] God's generals the guy that wrote it
[1:12:49] talk to Bob with the drums peculiar
[1:12:51] Ministry
[1:12:52] and I went ahead to say that you know it
[1:12:55] made a mistake
[1:12:58] and my question is always been
[1:13:01] you admit that this man was closer to
[1:13:04] God than you were
[1:13:06] right or you are
[1:13:08] so if he was closer to God will God come
[1:13:10] tell you that he made a Mr are you able
[1:13:13] to tell that he made a mistake when it
[1:13:15] was closer to God
[1:13:18] when God manifested so much in his
[1:13:21] ministry more than he ever did in any
[1:13:23] other person tell us both said that
[1:13:26] the closest to the ministry of Abraham
[1:13:29] was the ministry of Jesus Christ himself
[1:13:37] so when brother Brown says something
[1:13:40] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:43] is God speaking to us
[1:13:48] and the reason why God Vindicated that
[1:13:50] Ministry Beyond any reasonable doubt is
[1:13:55] so that we can have an uncle
[1:13:57] to hold to
[1:14:01] young people
[1:14:02] people will ask you questions
[1:14:06] it's getting
[1:14:09] so difficult now
[1:14:13] let's even talk about
[1:14:15] women wearing pants
[1:14:19] it's totally
[1:14:22] insane to some people when you tell them
[1:14:25] that a woman should not wear pants
[1:14:27] because the Bible said so because they
[1:14:29] will tell you their parents that are
[1:14:31] made for women
[1:14:38] but the reality is
[1:14:41] 50 years ago 60 years ago
[1:14:44] those that are much older the grandmas
[1:14:46] or the grandpas here we tell you that
[1:14:48] when they were growing up women did not
[1:14:50] wear pants
[1:14:52] Christian women did not wear pants
[1:14:58] and when they started wearing pants they
[1:15:00] were wearing pants that were made for
[1:15:02] women
[1:15:04] not mainstream they started to make pens
[1:15:06] for women which meant that something
[1:15:09] changed
[1:15:10] and at that time the Christian women
[1:15:13] will stay away from it because of the
[1:15:16] word of God
[1:15:17] so if it has become a great
[1:15:19] area now
[1:15:22] and it's hard for you to comprehend how
[1:15:25] to even convince someone that hands for
[1:15:29] women is wrong
[1:15:31] just take what the prophet has said
[1:15:35] what I'm saying tonight is God
[1:15:36] Vindicated this prophets so well that
[1:15:39] you can just completely block your ears
[1:15:42] to every other thing and say you know
[1:15:44] what if he's wrong I'd rather be wrong
[1:15:52] the second thing that God told him
[1:15:55] to tell if a prophet is from him or not
[1:15:59] is that when God sends a Prophets
[1:16:03] God will vindicate his ministry so that
[1:16:07] all its prophecies will come to pass
[1:16:11] Deuteronomy 18 21-22
[1:16:14] the Lord was speaking through Moses to
[1:16:16] the people of Israel he said and if thou
[1:16:18] shall say
[1:16:20] in thine hearts
[1:16:22] how shall we know the word with the Lord
[1:16:25] had not spoken
[1:16:28] so when a prophet speaketh in the name
[1:16:30] of the Lord if the faith follow North
[1:16:33] now come to pass
[1:16:35] that is the thing which the Lord had not
[1:16:38] spoken but the prophet has spoken it
[1:16:41] presumptuously
[1:16:43] thou shall not be afraid of him
[1:16:46] so how do we tell the prophet is true we
[1:16:49] want to watch what he says and see if he
[1:16:52] came to pass
[1:16:54] now there's so many things where the
[1:16:55] Bible says that has come to pass
[1:16:57] but let's just go back to 1933 when he
[1:16:59] saw a vision of seven events that the
[1:17:03] Lord said will come to pass before he's
[1:17:06] coming
[1:17:08] and some of them might not be able to
[1:17:09] relate to it because it happened many
[1:17:10] years ago but there is one that we
[1:17:13] definitely can relate with
[1:17:15] Ram says in the exposition of the seven
[1:17:17] Church ages the loud Asian Church age he
[1:17:19] said if you will pardon a personal note
[1:17:21] here
[1:17:22] I base this prediction on seven major
[1:17:25] continuous visions that came to me one
[1:17:28] Sunday morning in June 1933 and brother
[1:17:33] Ram before he had predicted that the
[1:17:35] world that Jesus will come by 1977 and
[1:17:39] he repeatedly said this is not a
[1:17:42] prophecy this is my prediction
[1:17:45] and now he's explaining why he based on
[1:17:48] his calculation predicted 1977 could be
[1:17:51] the time that Jesus Will Come
[1:17:53] or by Jesus would have come by 19
[1:17:57] 77.
[1:17:59] said the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said
[1:18:00] that the coming of the Lord was drawing
[1:18:02] now but that before he came seven major
[1:18:05] events will transpire
[1:18:07] I wrote them all down that's morning I
[1:18:10] give for the revelation of the Lord the
[1:18:13] first Vision was that mussolony
[1:18:16] Mussolini will invade Ethiopia and that
[1:18:20] Nation will fall at its steps that
[1:18:24] Vision surely did cost of repercussions
[1:18:27] and some were very angry when I said it
[1:18:29] I will not believe it
[1:18:31] but it happened that way
[1:18:34] he just walked in there with his modern
[1:18:35] arms and over and took over the natives
[1:18:39] didn't even have a chance but the vision
[1:18:41] also said that muslimi would come to a
[1:18:45] horrible end with his own people turning
[1:18:47] on him
[1:18:48] that came to pass just exactly
[1:18:52] as it was said
[1:18:54] the next Vision foretold an Austrian by
[1:18:57] the name Adolf Hitler will raise up as a
[1:19:00] dictator over Germany and it will draw
[1:19:02] the world into war
[1:19:04] it showed the the seed fried line and
[1:19:08] how our troops would have a terrible
[1:19:10] time to overcome it
[1:19:12] then it showed that Hitler will come to
[1:19:13] a mysterious end
[1:19:15] we know that happened as well
[1:19:17] the third Vision was in the realm of
[1:19:19] world politics where it showed me there
[1:19:21] will be three great isms fascism Nazism
[1:19:25] communism
[1:19:26] but that but that the first two will be
[1:19:29] swallowed up into the third The Voice
[1:19:32] admonished watch Russia watch Russia
[1:19:36] keep your eye on the King of the North
[1:19:39] the fourth Vision showed great advances
[1:19:42] in signs and that's the one I say we can
[1:19:44] easily relate to that will come after
[1:19:48] the second World War
[1:19:50] I believe that ended in 1948 somewhere
[1:19:53] around there
[1:19:54] it was headed up in the vision of a
[1:19:57] plastic bubble topped car
[1:20:00] that was running down beautiful highways
[1:20:03] on the remote control
[1:20:06] so that people appeared seated in this
[1:20:09] car without a steering wheel
[1:20:12] and they were playing some sort of a
[1:20:15] game to amuse themselves
[1:20:19] now if this Vision came in 2005
[1:20:22] we can say well we probably made it up
[1:20:25] but this came in 1933
[1:20:32] the kind of cars they had at that time
[1:20:35] compared to what brother Brown saw
[1:20:38] it only have been God that could have
[1:20:41] showed him the future
[1:20:44] most of the kids all like Tesla
[1:20:47] my kids at least they always I've been
[1:20:49] we're driving but we see a Tesla
[1:20:50] everybody goes hey that's a Tesla
[1:20:53] well that is not rich enough to buy one
[1:20:55] yet but
[1:20:59] one of the things that you see with this
[1:21:01] advancement of cars apart from the fact
[1:21:03] that their electric cars is the fact
[1:21:05] that there's a lot around driverless
[1:21:07] cars
[1:21:08] and they're going to be on our streets
[1:21:11] there's some on our streets but they're
[1:21:13] going to be more common on our streets
[1:21:14] very soon as soon as the regulations uh
[1:21:17] you know are tidied up and they can
[1:21:19] allow them to drive
[1:21:22] but God showed this Vision to his
[1:21:25] prophet
[1:21:26] almost a hundred years ago
[1:21:33] the fifth Vision had to do with the
[1:21:35] moral problem of our age centering
[1:21:37] mostly around women
[1:21:39] God showed me that women began to be out
[1:21:41] of their place with the granting of the
[1:21:43] votes then the cut of their hair which
[1:21:45] signified that they were no longer under
[1:21:48] the authority of a man but insisted on
[1:21:51] either equal rights
[1:21:53] or in most cases more than equal rights
[1:21:58] she adopted men's clothing and went into
[1:22:00] a state of undress
[1:22:03] until the last picture I saw was a woman
[1:22:06] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[1:22:09] apron
[1:22:11] it's getting to Summer Brothers
[1:22:13] let's get into summer
[1:22:15] you need that cross in your car to look
[1:22:18] away
[1:22:20] yeah a state of undress
[1:22:26] LeBron said with this Vision I saw the
[1:22:28] terrible perversion and moral of light
[1:22:31] of the whole world
[1:22:33] the sixth Vision there was a in America
[1:22:36] are most beautiful but cruel woman
[1:22:39] she held the people in their complete
[1:22:41] power I believe
[1:22:42] that this was the rise of the Roman
[1:22:45] Catholic Church though I knew it could
[1:22:47] possibly be a vision of some woman
[1:22:49] rising in great power in America due to
[1:22:53] a popular vote by women
[1:22:56] and said the last and the seventh Vision
[1:22:58] was wherein I heard a most terrible
[1:23:00] explosion as I turned to look I saw
[1:23:02] nothing but debris craters and smoke all
[1:23:05] over the land of America
[1:23:09] so those were seven visions that God
[1:23:11] gave with Abraham in 1933.
[1:23:14] we have seen most of them come to pass
[1:23:17] some of them we have seen in our age
[1:23:20] like in our own time not the age as you
[1:23:23] know from when when the age started the
[1:23:25] Malaysian age but we are saying that we
[1:23:28] have seen that in our own lifetime
[1:23:30] we are still the driverless car
[1:23:33] on the streets not no more in the
[1:23:36] laboratory on the street but the brand
[1:23:38] was here he said they were already
[1:23:40] having it in the laboratory before he
[1:23:42] left
[1:23:43] but now we can see them on the street
[1:23:46] and God told us that the way to tell if
[1:23:49] a prophet is true
[1:23:52] watch what he says
[1:23:55] if he comes to pass then that's a true
[1:23:58] prophet
[1:24:00] if he does not come too fast then that's
[1:24:02] a false prophet
[1:24:04] and there are many false prophets today
[1:24:07] we have a lot of them in Nigeria
[1:24:10] and he's getting to the end of the year
[1:24:13] prophecies are coming
[1:24:15] about the following year when an
[1:24:18] election is coming up prophecies are
[1:24:19] coming most of those prophecies are just
[1:24:21] guesses
[1:24:25] and when they don't come to pass
[1:24:28] people still keep following them
[1:24:33] well brother Brown challenged people
[1:24:36] many many many times over in his
[1:24:39] meetings and said you tell me one that
[1:24:42] has failed
[1:24:45] and nobody could come
[1:24:47] there was a time some people wanted to
[1:24:49] challenge him
[1:24:50] on some of the doctrines that he brought
[1:24:52] from the Bible
[1:24:55] I can't remember that I was going to
[1:24:56] find that story but I couldn't lay my
[1:24:58] hands on it but the brother that we're
[1:25:00] going to go with him
[1:25:02] he told the brother you know what these
[1:25:04] people have rented this place to use
[1:25:07] they are not going to use it but I said
[1:25:09] no they already paid for it but Ram said
[1:25:11] no they're not going to use they're
[1:25:12] going to use somewhere else and then he
[1:25:14] told the brother where each and every
[1:25:16] one of them receipts in that room
[1:25:21] when they all gather together the
[1:25:23] brother came and said you know what
[1:25:26] you might disagree with brother Brown on
[1:25:28] his doctrines
[1:25:30] but everything you have seen here he
[1:25:32] already told me before we got here
[1:25:41] God visited Us in this age
[1:25:47] now the last one
[1:25:49] still have a few minutes
[1:25:52] God says to his people the people of
[1:25:55] Israel
[1:25:56] that another way to tell the true
[1:25:58] Prophets
[1:26:00] or maybe not just telling a true prophet
[1:26:04] but one way to test a prophet
[1:26:07] and see whether you should obey him or
[1:26:10] not
[1:26:12] is by seeing whether this Prophet will
[1:26:14] point the people to the word or not
[1:26:18] so Deuteronomy Chapter 13 Verse 1 to 3.
[1:26:22] and this is very interesting
[1:26:25] because if the brand passed the two
[1:26:27] first tests
[1:26:29] and he filled this one
[1:26:31] then we have every reason to say no we
[1:26:34] are not going to follow him
[1:26:36] because in this one I'm going to read a
[1:26:38] true prophet
[1:26:40] could actually fail this test
[1:26:42] now this is what it says if there arise
[1:26:45] among you of prophets
[1:26:47] or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a
[1:26:51] sign
[1:26:52] and a Wonder
[1:26:54] and the sign or the one that come to
[1:26:57] pass
[1:26:59] see
[1:27:01] ing a vision he said it it has come to
[1:27:04] pass right
[1:27:06] wherefore it speak unto this saying
[1:27:10] let us go after other gods
[1:27:13] we that was not known and let us serve
[1:27:16] them
[1:27:17] thou shall not hearken unto the words of
[1:27:20] that prophet or that dreamer of dreams
[1:27:23] for the Lord your God proveth you
[1:27:28] to know whether yield Lord the Lord your
[1:27:30] God with all your hearts and with all
[1:27:33] your soul
[1:27:36] so Prophet a dreamer of Dreams can be
[1:27:39] true sent from God
[1:27:42] everything he says comes to pass
[1:27:45] but when he turns you away from the word
[1:27:48] God tells you don't follow him
[1:27:52] why I am intentionally doing that to
[1:27:56] prove you to see if you will love me
[1:27:59] now we know brother Brahm did not tell
[1:28:01] us to go away from the word
[1:28:04] was to point us to the word
[1:28:07] everyone that is against for the brand
[1:28:10] the only reason they're against him is
[1:28:13] because he pointed us to the word is
[1:28:15] because he preached what Paul preached
[1:28:19] when you show them the Bible I'm going
[1:28:21] to read what Abraham here to one of the
[1:28:24] places he just kind of reiterated his
[1:28:26] position
[1:28:27] when you open
[1:28:29] to Acts chapter 2.
[1:28:31] and tell them this is how baptism
[1:28:33] happened in the Bible
[1:28:35] they will explain it away from you
[1:28:40] I don't get to read all those nonsense
[1:28:42] that the sign whatever believe this
[1:28:44] belief the sign is what I'll call them
[1:28:46] because they don't definitely believe
[1:28:48] the sign and all the things they write
[1:28:50] but some of the things that I've seen
[1:28:52] them say is that they're trying to say
[1:28:54] brother I'm got
[1:28:56] the the the the doctrine of the right
[1:28:58] baptism from the Oneness people no it's
[1:29:01] from the Bible
[1:29:04] it's not about the Oneness it's exactly
[1:29:06] from the Bible from the pages of the
[1:29:07] scripture he brought it back to us
[1:29:10] what God Said
[1:29:13] here in condemnation by representation
[1:29:17] he said don't try to judge God by our
[1:29:19] own feeling we've got to judge God by
[1:29:21] his words and what he said
[1:29:23] don't go off on what some tantrum this
[1:29:26] is a great church has wedded a lot of
[1:29:28] Storms and these is that come back to
[1:29:32] what God Said
[1:29:34] I stand before him I want to be found
[1:29:37] innocence of ever trying to add one
[1:29:41] thing to that word or take one away
[1:29:46] once you just believe it just exactly
[1:29:49] the way it is
[1:29:50] teach the people to turn right up to it
[1:29:55] over the brand wanted to do is to
[1:29:57] present the words not his own ideas
[1:30:00] just a word
[1:30:02] and the Bible says this
[1:30:04] I can't help what anybody else sees if
[1:30:09] the Bible says this I can't help what
[1:30:11] anyone else says I got to stay right
[1:30:14] with that
[1:30:16] is that for washing feets they say ah
[1:30:19] Pentecostal brethrenal brother oh
[1:30:21] brother oh we used to do that
[1:30:25] and I said let's do it
[1:30:27] yes if we did it once Jesus did it
[1:30:29] washing Faith oh say it's unhealthy
[1:30:33] people has athletic feet
[1:30:37] the Bible said I don't care what they
[1:30:39] got
[1:30:40] they might have had it in them days in
[1:30:42] the days of Jesus right
[1:30:44] where the gene says they get healed I'm
[1:30:47] saying yeah yeah that's right God Is A
[1:30:49] Healer see they try to find a way of
[1:30:53] Escape
[1:30:55] like say oh I wouldn't drink out of some
[1:30:59] glass that somebody else drank out of
[1:31:01] unless it was scuttled
[1:31:05] oh my
[1:31:06] my brother and sister is my brother and
[1:31:09] sister amen God is my protection if
[1:31:13] something is wrong
[1:31:15] I trust him said let's go back to the
[1:31:18] word I don't care it's called or
[1:31:21] whatever it is or what church he belongs
[1:31:23] to you if he's my brother he is my
[1:31:27] brother
[1:31:29] I'll carry out the Commandments of God
[1:31:31] so that's the reason friends when it
[1:31:33] comes to water baptism in the name of
[1:31:35] Jesus Christ I must remain there
[1:31:38] oh that keeps me from many great saving
[1:31:41] Souls out there because with the brown
[1:31:43] we know that when he started holding on
[1:31:44] to the doctrine that God has shown him
[1:31:46] according to the Bible it lost a lot of
[1:31:48] freight most of his sponsors won't
[1:31:51] sponsor him anymore
[1:31:52] so he said well it might keep me from
[1:31:54] grade seven Souls out there it sure does
[1:31:56] on that one issue because of the extreme
[1:32:00] trinitarian belief
[1:32:03] something that is not in the Bible
[1:32:07] that was what happened to Israel Israel
[1:32:10] decided to reject the prophet of God and
[1:32:13] accept organization
[1:32:15] Samuel told him you want a king over you
[1:32:19] when you have the skin you don't have
[1:32:21] choice on what happens to your sons and
[1:32:23] your daughters it's going to mix this
[1:32:25] out of them
[1:32:26] yet they said no we want the king
[1:32:31] the Bible says sure I believe in
[1:32:34] father-son Holy Ghost as offices of God
[1:32:36] not of free Gods but three offices of
[1:32:40] the same God he is Father Son and Holy
[1:32:42] Ghost but that's titles of his office he
[1:32:45] is God the Father sure he was in the
[1:32:47] beginning he is God the son was made
[1:32:50] Flesh on Earth is God the Holy Ghost
[1:32:52] which is in me but it's the same God all
[1:32:55] along three offices
[1:32:57] it once couldn't be touched or nothing
[1:33:00] then he calmed down was made flesh and
[1:33:03] took my sins and bore my sins then while
[1:33:06] he Sanctified me with his own blood then
[1:33:08] the Holy Ghost will come in and he and I
[1:33:10] can Fellowship like we did in Eden will
[1:33:13] love one another is my father and his
[1:33:15] son not three gods that same God that
[1:33:18] created me and loved me gave itself for
[1:33:21] me is a God that's in me
[1:33:24] his name was Jesus Christ when he was on
[1:33:27] Earth there is not another name given
[1:33:29] under Heaven among women whereby you
[1:33:31] must be saved now if he hurts my friends
[1:33:35] I can't help it
[1:33:37] I'd rather hurt my friend
[1:33:39] than hurt my father
[1:33:42] she is my relative my father God that's
[1:33:46] what his word says God
[1:33:49] had he never let me hybrid I bred
[1:33:52] anything saying the days of Miracles
[1:33:54] despised oh Jesus doesn't do the same oh
[1:33:57] that might be telepathy that might be
[1:34:00] mind reading I don't believe we have
[1:34:02] prophets in these days but I'm saying
[1:34:04] the Bible said we would
[1:34:06] I believe it
[1:34:08] we're looking for one and not for for
[1:34:11] anointing one like John the Baptist you
[1:34:13] come forth to forerun the first coming
[1:34:15] of Christ comes to follow the second
[1:34:17] coming of Christ as he did he promised
[1:34:18] that restore the faith of the people
[1:34:20] back to God what was John to do restore
[1:34:23] the feet the faith I was once the real
[1:34:26] sea that was in the guardian of Eden to
[1:34:28] take God's word where it was I bread in
[1:34:31] by churchianity
[1:34:33] John comes to bring it back Hallelujah
[1:34:36] to shake the nation before the great and
[1:34:38] Dreadful day of the Lord comes that's
[1:34:41] John's Mission anointed one
[1:34:45] so we see that these three things that
[1:34:48] God said we should look out for in
[1:34:50] telling if a prophet is from God or not
[1:34:53] we have brought for the brown
[1:34:57] to the test
[1:34:59] and he has passed the test
[1:35:02] does that make you feel good
[1:35:05] so we'll tell Satan to shut his mouth
[1:35:09] we'll tell the critics to shut their
[1:35:12] mouths
[1:35:13] this message has been given to us
[1:35:17] it's it's it's one of the greatest
[1:35:19] things that God has done through all the
[1:35:21] ages
[1:35:26] is one of the greatest things
[1:35:28] God has never revealed himself in
[1:35:31] plainness
[1:35:33] as he has today I'll call the musicians
[1:35:35] he hasn't revealed himself
[1:35:38] like like Brother Bear was saying I
[1:35:40] guess last Sunday
[1:35:41] the Saints of all other ages
[1:35:45] they knew God in part
[1:35:49] they couldn't see the entire picture
[1:35:52] and I was thinking about it why would
[1:35:54] brother Brown be so much Vindicated by
[1:35:56] God
[1:35:59] so that we'll have no reasonable doubts
[1:36:05] so that our senses even if we were to
[1:36:07] rely on senses
[1:36:09] and go away from Faith which we are told
[1:36:12] not to do even by senses
[1:36:15] we'll be able to tell that this man
[1:36:18] was the greatest man that God ever used
[1:36:21] in this generation
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:25] so if doubts come
[1:36:27] if somebody says something
[1:36:30] there's something brother Brahm says and
[1:36:32] something in you is reasoning against it
[1:36:34] and say it doesn't matter remember that
[1:36:37] is no one else but the devil okay
[1:36:41] amen there's a song we used to sing I
[1:36:43] don't think we have it here
[1:36:46] he said in the days in this days of
[1:36:48] Trials so near the end
[1:36:51] when Christ from Glory
[1:36:54] not now descent
[1:36:56] men's hearts are failing
[1:36:58] and filled with fear
[1:37:00] we know the end
[1:37:03] is surely here
[1:37:04] says Soul just be faithful
[1:37:07] believe his word
[1:37:10] listen to the prophets that you've heard
[1:37:15] listen to his message
[1:37:19] uh listen to The Prophet's message he'd
[1:37:21] walk in the light where is turned Dudley
[1:37:26] said in every age
[1:37:29] a light did Shine
[1:37:32] to point God's people the truth to hear
[1:37:35] he said in this last age a light shines
[1:37:38] bright
[1:37:39] so men
[1:37:41] receive it
[1:37:42] walk in the light
[1:37:47] another verse says
[1:37:50] don't be fearful for getting it because
[1:37:53] I'm not singing it I'm just trying to
[1:37:55] read the lyrics
[1:37:56] said your Prophet sleepeth is not that
[1:38:00] the bride is waiting for the call
[1:38:02] and in that hope
[1:38:04] without Rejoice so be faithful
[1:38:07] believe his word stay with the message
[1:38:09] you have heard
[1:38:11] listen to His prophets
[1:38:14] is message heat walk in the light
[1:38:18] while where is Sarah
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:29] let's sing let's be on our feet tonight
[1:38:32] so it's just been a little bit of
[1:38:35] a Bible study a reassurance telling us
[1:38:38] that we have not believed cunningly
[1:38:40] devised Fables
[1:38:45] if they should do anything at all to you
[1:38:48] should increase your confidence in the
[1:38:51] message
[1:38:54] remember Paul was saying it
[1:38:57] during the song service
[1:38:59] God gave our Prophet the opportunity to
[1:39:01] go beyond the curtain of time
[1:39:05] and when was there they told him you
[1:39:07] will be judged
[1:39:09] by what you have preached
[1:39:11] and he said will Paul be judged as well
[1:39:15] I said yes I said okay that's good
[1:39:17] because I preach what Paul preet if the
[1:39:20] people of Paul
[1:39:22] will make it then my people will make it
[1:39:25] and then what was the response that you
[1:39:27] and I gave we said we are resting on
[1:39:30] that
[1:39:33] year not
[1:39:36] only

[1:43:35] believe
[1:43:37] you know um
[1:43:39] the pastor of the church we were in
[1:43:40] Nigeria before we moved here was saying
[1:43:42] something recently which I think was
[1:43:44] profound I've heard him say many times
[1:43:47] he said if brother Brown were to raise
[1:43:48] up for the from the dead today
[1:43:51] and come and tell him that sorry the
[1:43:54] message was wrong
[1:43:55] it's going to look at the Brahm in the
[1:43:57] face and say sorry you came too late
[1:44:01] this has already changed my life
[1:44:05] I think that's the greatest Vindication
[1:44:07] of the message in our lives that we can
[1:44:10] say that we were once sinners
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:13] for By the Light of the word has been
[1:44:16] given on this age our lives have been
[1:44:19] transformed

[1:44:46] my brothers or sisters even if My Heart
[1:44:48] Lord Jesus

[1:44:58] Jesus
[1:44:59] Christ father may I felt increase
[1:45:02] in this word that you have given unto us

[1:45:16] Lord help us to believe with all of our
[1:45:18] hearts dear father to realize their lord
