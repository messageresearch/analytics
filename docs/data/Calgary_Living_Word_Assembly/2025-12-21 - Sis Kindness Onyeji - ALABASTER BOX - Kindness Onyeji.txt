========================================

The room grew still as she made her way to Jesus. She stumbled through the tears that made her blind. She felt such pain. Some spoke in anger. Her folks whispered, "There's no place here for your kind." But still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she knelt before his feet. And though she spoke no words, everything she said was hers. as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster. And I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alaster. Please don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I'll dry them with my hand. You went there the night he found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his love arms around me. And you don't know the curse of the oil and my alabaster. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I can't forget the way life used to be. See, I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound. And I spent my days. I poured my life without measure into a little treasure box. I thought I found until the day when Jesus came to me and he healed my soul with the wonder of his touch. So now I'm giving back to him all the praise he's worthy of. See, I've been forgi. And that's why I love him so much. I've come to pour my praise onto him like oil from Mary's alabaster bus. So please don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I dry them with my hair. She were there the night he found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the curse of my oil. You don't know the curse of my praise. You don't know the curse of the oil. In my head, but ooh.
