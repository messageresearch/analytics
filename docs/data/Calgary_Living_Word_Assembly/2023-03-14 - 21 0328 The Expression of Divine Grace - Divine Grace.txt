TRANSCRIPT
========================================
case an action for villains God had thoughts God had feelings but God needed to make it known God needed to bring it into friction and when we Define grace the dictionary says it's unmerited favor Webster says it's unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their sanctification so where today can we find the expression of the grace of God rather than in the bride of Christ and this morning by the grace of God what was laid in my heart is the Holy Spirit wants to draw his bright closer just give her a cuddle and let her know that she's safe that's the intention of this message in my sound like as a message that is telling us that we can do anything but Abraham said as a Christian I can do anything because what is in me as a desire is to do what God wants so I do what I want but this is talking about the grace of God and how All Through the Ages from the beginning God has had a special group of people that he has treated differently God has treated the special way God has been maybe the word the world will use now is discriminatory it treats one this way and treats these ones the other way but the Bible told us like we read is not just god making that choice to treat some people right and treat some people the other way he said that the purpose of God according to election might stand God by far knowledge I knew the future he knew was going to believe in him he knew who will be saved and by that for knowledge God made a predetermination of their Destiny it is called a predestination God sanctioned it that none of those people that made it by is for knowledge will be lost I don't want to go ahead of myself but we're going to see this morning that we are in such a safe place as the bride of Christ we are going to see this morning that even if we were to decide to go to hell there is no way that will happen brother Graham said that if you if a child of God Is Lost he said a part of God Is Lost and what that means is God is incomplete and God cannot be incomplete let's look at what happened in Genesis The First Family we know what happened with Adam and Eve and how the serpent came and beguiled Eve and we know what happened the seed of the serpents and the seed of Adam and we know that the seed of the serpent was Cain and the seed of Adam was able but these two young men they knew that there was a need to offer sacrifice to God and in my imagination I used to think about it that there could have been you know growing up I think brother said that as well recently Adam training these two boys and telling them about what happened out of curiosity they would have wanted to know what really happened in the garden and Adam would have told them oh myself and your mother did something wrong and this is what happened but Adam also explained to them he must have what God did as a remedy what did God do as a remedy God took an innocent lamb and God sacrificed that lamb that lamb took their place and both of those young men were hearing the word but for one it was a revelation for the other it was not revealed because when time came for them to also ask for the Forgiveness of their sins the Bible said Cain was a tiller of the ground it was a farmer and he felt well I'm a farmer I'm going to take the best of my cross so the problem said they didn't give God Rotten Tomatoes he actually brought the best of his scrubs and tried to offer that to God if we look at it as humans that was good intention amen he was doing what he thought was right but we cannot serve god with good intentions we can only serve god with Revelation it has to be revealed that's why but the brand said in the church age book he said the importance of Revelation to the True Believer can never be overly emphasized importance of Revelation by the spirits to the believer can never be overemphasized so we found Abel doing something different it was not just because he attended to ship it was because the other revelation of what happened how did this fall happen it was revealed to Abel and Abel took an innocent lamb and did exactly what God did and as you would expect God had respect the Bible said God had respect to the sacrifice of Abel but God rejected the sacrifice of Cain it had to be Revelation this this was the first time we saw God treat two people differently so to say but what God was doing is God was following the place where the revelation of his Word was God will always confirm his word and we know that from there you know can Kill Devil because it was very upset that God rejected the sacrifice and we know what God Said I believe said to us on Wednesday it was the same voice that Abel heard that King heard as well the same voice that told Abel kill the lamb told Cain and said to him go and do the same thing that your brother did and you will be accepted but without revelation we cannot truly serve God and the world continued and it came to a time in Genesis chapter 6 The Bible said it repented God that he made man God for the first time the Bible told us that God has a regret for something he had done and God said I'm going to destroy man I'm going to destroy all cattle the the situation at that time you know Jesus Christ told us that as it was in the days of Noah though so shall it be so we can actually imagine that the same thing that we are seeing today was what God saw all the Abomination that's happened on the land meeting between man and Beast was probably happening at that time and God said I shouldn't have made man in the first place the Bible said he dreamed the heart of God they made me but do you know the most important part of this part of the scripture was verse 8 that said but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord [Music] that God could still find a man in the rocks and in all of the the Abomination that was happening God still found a man that found Grace in the sight and let me just chip in a short story about Grace here just to give us you know a description of what Grace is because just using the words of merited favor um might not actually you know make us understand it so there was a story told I can't remember where I heard the story but growing up I had a story of a man who was a pauper and he was you know living outside the city but right in the city the city actually um just lost their King and they had consulted their gods and their gods had said well the next person to be king you'll find this person at the gates so you just go to the gates of the city the first man you find there will become king and this power was going through towards the city just about the time they were going to the gates and when they got to the gate they met the Pauper a poor man that had nothing that was in rags and based on what their gods had said that was supposed to be their King so they took him and took him from the state that he was or Papa a maiden King amen a popper that had nothing to becoming the king of one of the richest cities on Earth but one thing this Papa did to understand that this is Grace and never forget it it took the rags that he had he told them give me a room and put a chair in there and he took those rags and just put it on the chair like you know made it look like someone sitting on that chair and anytime he got puffed up in his heart and felt I'm King and I can do anything I want it goes to that little room he opens the door and it reminds himself this is where I'm coming from that's what Grace is is on meritable it's something that we did not deserve in the first place so when the Bible said no I found Grace in the sight of God it was not because of Noah's righteousness God just gave Grace Grace is freely given Grace is a favor Grace is unmerited so Noah found Grace on the sight of God and Noah became the man through whom God preserved the the human race and the animal race in the anti-delivian world and we know what happened after Noah came out of the floor and and God started to replenish the Earth through Noir there was a man in Genesis chapter 12 that was called Abraham that also found favor with God and God called Abraham and I'll draw a little bit on Abraham's story is is very interesting and and it's not just interesting Abraham's story ties to us the Covenant that God gave Abraham was different from the Covenant that God gave Moses for the children of Israel brother Paul made us understand that the Covenant that God gave Abraham was unconditional brother Brown said somewhere it did not depend on Abraham's success or Abraham's faithfulness he depended on God's faithfulness what that meant is no matter what happened God had to keep that Covenant and we saw God calling out Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 and God called Abraham and told him to leave his father's land his Kindred and go to a place that he was going to show him and God said something to Abraham that I found remarkable God said to him I will bless them that blessing what was he saying people are going to see you and they're going to bless you and just because they bless you I will bless them he didn't stop there there are some people that are going to see you and curse you and just because they curse you I'm going to curse them talk about Grace what else can we say that Abraham did to deserve this and Abraham was not entirely a perfect man because right after God called Abraham and he left his father's land and went to kept traveling going to find that City that God said he was going to show him he got to a point where there was farming on the land and Abraham went to Egypt but the RAM said he shouldn't have gone to Egypt that was backsliding but when he got to Egypt what did he do because of the men of the land and because of the beauty of his wife he told the LIE and you will imagine that when Abraham lied God would punish Abraham for lying but God did not plague Abraham God plagued pharaoh and his servants for trying to take Abraham's wife because Abraham deceived them you will expect that God will go to Abraham and scold Abraham but God didn't do that this was a man that found exceptional favor with God and God told pharaoh the woman that you have in your house is another man's wife well I didn't know that and he sent Abraham away and when Abraham left another remarkable you know part of Abraham's life was if you remember when Abraham actually left his father's land God told him to live by himself alone leave your Kindle leave your family leave everybody just you and your immediate family leave but he went with lots and in Genesis 13 we know that the men and servants and the and of Abraham and the men Servants of Lord started to strive and that caused a division and and Abraham went and said you know what Lord you know there's no need for us to strive just just look at the land it's been given to me choose a place a lot to look by sight when Lots looked and chose the place that looked green that had very good posture and left program was describing this to us that Sarah started looking at Lords and Lot's wife and wondering if they admit the wrong choice or not and she started getting worked on and she started telling Abraham you know we are living on the dance that there's no water you know things are not doing going going fine and look at Lots down in the valley they're doing so well yeah but do you know what God Said to Abraham just after lot left him God told Abraham he said lift up your eyes look not what look Southward look Eastward look everywhere he said I have given it to you at the time when it looked like Abraham had lost because Lots took the greener pastures God said to him don't worry about it I have given it to you God didn't even stop there God told him he said walk around Hallelujah make sure that you use your feet to take possession of that land what I've given it to you did Abraham literally have it no but that was God giving them a promise this land belongs to you and to your seed after you and in Genesis 17 we see God confirming that Covenant that he made with a sign of circumcision you know before then I believed in Genesis 14 you know it's quite interesting Abraham lot at you know gone ahead to choose and and sometimes when you look at it Lots at every reason to have made Abraham to choose first right Abraham was his uncle Abraham was the one that brought him out Abraham was the pace setter but he made the choice to go to Saddam and when he was in there you know that there was there was a war the the kings that came five kings came against where I saw them where where Lord was and took him captive and Abraham Brotherly Love expressing Brotherly Love went after those kings and conquered them with his servants with knives and not not trained Army just someone that had the grace of God and he went after them and he actually overcame and when he was coming back he met Melchizedek and I really love I like to read how Melchizedek addressed him you know he gets to a point where you realize that people start to call you by God's name because they've seen so much of God in you that's there's no way they can actually describe you without having to put God's name in there [Music] and it said I think it's verse 19 of Genesis 14. and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high God Abraham of the most high God he didn't just call him Abraham at this point Abraham has already got into that place where his name was been tied to the name of God Abraham of the most high God and he didn't stop that he called them the possesso of Heaven and Earth so in in 17 we see God confirming that Covenant to Abraham by giving the sign of circumcision and that became a sign that God had given Abraham an unconditional Covenant and that was supposed to be passed on from generation to generation and we know that brother Paul came and expressed to us that circumcision being a type of the circumcision of our souls today and in Genesis 18 we saw God coming down to visit Abraham God came down to visit his friend and when God came down in verse 19 he said it was he was thinking about you know God God was actually considering should I actually tell Abraham about you know what is what's going to happen you know shall I tell him about what is going to happen you know in Sodom and Gomorrah but there was a reason why God decided to tell Abraham his secrets he said for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgments that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that's which he had spoken of him and whenever I read this creature I mean it's a challenge to we Brothers men and how God looks at us and how God considers as priests in our homes God look at Abraham I know him he will command his children his household after him he will ensure they keep the way of the Lord is going to be the one that is in there to guard what is coming in to be sure that there's no fields that comes in I think many years ago there's a song I heard you know I can't remember who sang it but when this person was singing at some point it was just kind of putting some words and he said to the devil he said you have no place in my home is Abraham standing in the gates not only instructing his children and his household but standing in the gate as the priest of the house God saw that and God recognized that and that was something that made God to make a decision you know what I have so much respect for this man that I will not keep the secret away from me and God told Abraham and God did not just tell Abraham was going to happen God sought advice from Abraham what do you think I should do and Abraham said oh Lord if there just be 50 righteous people you know will you just save this this this this this this city and not destroy it and there was a bargain happening between man and God we're talking about the grace of God this morning we're talking about the expression of that Grace and and and when we think about it you know down from his glory he said the great creator became my savior God stepped down to our level you know I used to think about that what condescend and you know over time I used to think that it meant you know condense because sometimes you can't kind of think about it being condensed but that's that's it's not the same meaning condescend is to step down to a lower level and the way I used to describe it is if Trudeau decides to pick up another job and it decides to be treat sweeper it sweeps the streets and he does that at night still the same true rule that's prime minister of Canada is going to end this let's say shift job and go back to being prime minister but that's him condescending to the level of being a cleaner a sweet sorry a street sweeper and if he has colleagues as other cleaners they have that ability to relate with him as a colleague but then they have the opportunity as well to realize that this is not just a street sweeper this is also the prime minister and because he's the Prime Minister if I have a problem I can actually speak with him because he's holding those two offices that's the same thing that it is with us and God that was the same thing that happened it was the god of Heaven the create the maker of heaven on Earth that stepped down into flesh that came and sat with Abraham and they had a conversation and in that condescending that God did God gave Abraham a specific promise a specific you know instruction on when that promise was going to come he said according to the time of life This Promise you've been waiting on for 25 years according to the time of life it is going to come to pass and then we know what happened Genesis 20. you know God had changed their bodies the other body change himself and Sarah and they had gone to the land of the Philistines and I beat my leg swords here and when he saw Sarah you know Abraham had lied again and said you know what this is my sister not my wife just tell tell them that you're my sister because you're so pretty I think they might kill me just to have you but then God plagued the family of abimelech and I've been like so you know had an encounter with God in the dream and God told him you're as good as a dead man because the man that you have is another person's wife say restore the man is wife and I've even like said to God I've done this in the Integrity of my heart God said I know and that's why I've not killed you but one thing you know you need to know is you and all your servants you're already barren and for you to be healed go meet that liar that liar has got to pray for you the grace of God it's freely given it's not about what we have done it's not we are not trying to encourage ourselves to just do you know do whatever we like to do or just be be complacent or not be be true Christians because what we do when we understand this Grace it drives us to a point where we want to give our all to him in appreciation for what he has done you love the Lord this morning amen and amen and in Genesis 22 Abraham was going to get us test God had given the promise divide Isaac and God told him this child take him and go on sacrifice him because what God wanted to make that Covenant double sure when God makes a promise it's enough that that promise will come to pass amen but God wanted to make it double sure because that Covenant was not just for Abraham it was for Abraham and his seat after him and we know that seed was not the natural seed we know that Sid was speaking about Jesus Christ we know when he said to Abraham in thy said shall all the nations of the heart be blessed he was talking about Jesus coming and how the coming of Jesus has been a blessing to all of us today so Abraham went to Isaac you know they got there on that mount we know the story and Abraham was going to do just what God said he was going to do and the angel of the Lord came and held his head and let him know that God said now I know and I've thought about it now I know can God be knowing anything new no God was knowing by experience God knew all the time that Abraham was going to do what he was going to do but it had never happened before before that time but now it has happened and God could now say now I know by experience that you will do just what I ask you to do and that drove God to a point where God said I'm going to swear by myself and brother Paul telling us he said by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie for God where me when God made the promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself and that was not just for Abraham because brother Paul said that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation a strong consolation he wants to give us a strong consolation no matter what we are going through in life God wants to give us a strong consolation many times points where they give up on themselves speaking with a young friend of mine from back in Nigeria yesterday you know is that many struggles in his life a young man that's you know just got addicted to pornography and to various you know at some point drugs and all of those things and he will always want to come back to God but then something keeps driving him away and you know yesterday we got on a call after a while and he was telling me what had happened the past week and he said one of the things that he has seen is you know he's trying to do his business nothing was working we got to a point where he said to himself I've got to make my ways right with God and he said to himself going forward I'm going to spend the first seven days of every month just fasting and praying and as he started to do that he saw that his business was also going in the right direction why because I said to him I said you are a child of God many other people will be successful without doing what God wants them to do still living in sin and doing all of those things but God made your business not to thrive because God wanted to get your attention and now that God has your attention you'll do well but you make sure that you see in life because God is not going to lose any of his own so it was not just a promise to Abraham it was a promise for us God swore by himself by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie that Covenant God said I will not break it and we know that you know after that we had Isaac and Isaac married Rebecca and where we read in Romans chapter 9 was talking about those two sons of Isaac and Ray Baker Rebecca was expecting you know she was Barren for a while and then Isaac prayed and the lawyer the prayer of Isaac and Rebecca conceit and at some point I was just imagining you know I was just imagining that she must have got to got into a point where you know she started having what women would not naturally have when they're you know having about to have their babies when they're pregnant kids kicking in the tummy and she felt it was normal but this was getting you know more painful this was getting too worrisome for her she probably went to all the women and said you know I'm having this rumbling happening in my tummy and they said well that's that's normal you know when you're pregnant you know kids will kick and he said this this is very unusual but then she went to God and when she spoke to God told her the reason why this happening to you to you is that there are two Nations in your womb and the older Shall Serve the younger that was as much as God told Rebecca but the poll telling us that God actually said to Rebecca that Esau have I hated and Jacob have I loved and he said here these children had not yet been born they had neither known good they're neither done evil but God had a purpose according to election before they were ever born gone by full knowledge knew their destination and said that was what was going to happen nothing could change it let me read something to the brand said about foreknowledge and the message the identification of Christ in all ages but the Brahm said I now remember paragraph 73 and now remember if you ever did or ever will have eternal life you add it with him then before the foundation of the world see you had it with him because Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer to redeem anything is Bring It Back from where it falling from or where it went from redeem it bring it back but Ram now says and you the way you look Who You Are what your name is that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world I want that to sink in the way you look Who You Are what your name is that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world you know and I I I remember that song you know that very first song in in the only belief song book only believe fear not little flock at some point he said you're a shepherd selected the path you must trade and what occurred to me is that my shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ so many options that I will think are better options maybe I would have said oh you should have done this we should have planned my life out this way she should have made it look at this way you should have you should have avoided this part of my life you should have not made me go into this kind of things that I did in my life that I regret but what did he say your Shepherds selected he made a choice the best choice of the path that you must shred your Shepherd did that that was God's thinking before the foundation of the way you look you might say I've fallen in sin that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world you might say I'm poor that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world you might say I've lost loved ones that was God's thinking before the foundation of the world amen the ram said and Jesus came not to save the whole thing he wanted to for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the wish of the Bible said is not the will of God that any Shall Perish God wanted to save the all thing if he could but he came to redeem redeem means what bring back then that was in his thoughts before the beginning what does this tell us if you were in his spot before the beginning you can't stay back you must be redeemed and anyone that was not in a spot before the beginning can never be redeemed that is how it is it sounds discriminatory it sounds like God is partial but that's not what it is but God by his foreign knowledge knowing what was there before the beginning is only able to restore that which had been there before the beginning nothing more nothing less let's look at the story of Moses in constructs with pharaoh you know Moses was born by his Jewish parents but then the daughter of pharaoh saw the princess saw him and then took him to be Stone and then he liked he had to live in the palace and he must have probably lived with the pharaoh that's you know was was was was there when he had to go back and deliver the children of Israel and when God was talking about Moses in Exodus 2 when that record was being captured was talking about the mother of Moses and said and the woman conceived and very soon and when she saw him that it was a goodly child Moses was a goodly child and we saw these two boys grew up in the palace in Egypt Moses and pharaoh and we know what happened Moses after leaving for 40 years right there you know he had heard the story of him being born as a deliverer but I'm actually you know kind of explained that in the in a way it dramatized that in teaching on Moses and he felt I will make this happen by myself I'm a deliverer right so I'll go deliver my people he had a special connection with the Jews not only because it looked like them but his mother had told them the story but the brand said that his mother told him everything that happened she was bringing him up in the way of the Lord and he felt he could do it by his power and when that filled he went into exile for 40 years until the Lord called him when the Lord called him and told him to go and deliver the people his own way not by fighting but with just that road that became not Moses rods and Moses wrote anymore but became God's Own rod with that stuff that God said he should go and deliver the people away God also said about pharaoh he said and in this very deed for this course have I raised thee up for to show thee in thee my power God decided to raise up a man just to show that God could plague that Nation the richest nation that God could plague that Nation to a point where the nation was completely destroyed and God could deliver his people do you know that when Moses first went to pharaoh what Moses asked for was very easy we want to go into the Wilderness for three days and serve our God and will come back sounded really easy but the Bible continuously said as each of those plagues came he said and the Lord had in the heart of pharaoh the Lord did it because God raised him up because God wanted to show his power with those 10 plagues they couldn't have stopped at five God was going to completely destroy Egypt because God had promised Abraham your children will be strangers and the strained luck for 400 years and after 400 years I'll deliver them and he said the nation that will hold them captive I will destroy and God raised up Pharaoh what are we trying to say God God that knows the future decides to look at his own people and express his grace towards them the grace is extended to all but not all can accept that Grace is not in all that that Grace can be expressed look at Peter and Judas those are two disciples that both filled Jesus when I thought about this yesterday I think I was in the shower I just started screaming Peter denied Jesus Judas betrayed Jesus but in Luke 22 Jesus looked at Peter and said to him you know that was like the last days of Jesus Peter was showing a lot of enthusiasm he was showing a lot of you know Jesus just showing that commitment to Jesus I will go anywhere I will stand there for you nothing will happen and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan a desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee talk about Grace but I have prayed for thee that I faithful not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren that was what God that's what Jesus said to Peter Peter was such a failure just like Judas was but in Peter was a seed that was not present in Judas that is the difference that is why we read that part where the Paul told us that we are A peculiar people a royal priesthood a holy nation we are different we did not make ourselves different that was how God intended it before the foundation of the world and brothers and sisters nothing can change it not even you yourself that's what I want us to realize this money nothing can change it not your sins not your failures Peter failed God Peter denied him but before Peter could deny him Jesus already prayed for Peter and you want me to tell you something that's so cool before you were even born Jesus prayed for you [Music] Hallelujah John 17 20. neither pray I for this alone but for them also that Shall Believe on me through their words he has prayed for you he has prayed for me I'm pleased to know that it doesn't depend on me Hallelujah it does not depend on me it's not a conditional Covenant it's a non-conditional covenant and when we see that he has done this for us but Abraham told us a story or an analogy of someone who was taken to an arcade and told this is all for you he said I don't imagine that person is going to sit down somewhere and just start to appreciate that well this is for me what is he going to do he's going to explore these are mine I want to see it oh there's a big hotel here and that's mine as well yes I want to go in there I want to see how the rooms look like why because it belongs to me and if the promises of God are ours today then we should explore it we are a special people way peculiar people and I want us to hear some of those promises I know we know them but I want to read out some of those promises to us and I'm going to close shortly I know I Don't Preach too long but you know it's it's just it's just good to remind ourselves of these things that God has given to us and as you hear those promises you know what you need to do just say Amen just say Amen just just tell yourself these are mine these are for me my condition might not look like it but my condition has got nothing to do with it because the word of God will stand the expression of God's grace you want to see God's grace but where I'm talking about brother Moody he taught about Grace he got into that point he thought about it Grace became personified to him he went on the streets he was asking everybody do you know Grace do you know Grace and someone said who are you talking about Grace who and he said the grace of God why that was a man in whom the grace of God has been expressed it was a man that that Grace had been shown had been made manifest through him and he realized it he realized he had nothing to do with what he had done he realized that he hadn't done anything to deserve this unmerited favor and when he got to the point where that struck him he wanted to meet Grace fed this was a person I need to meet but we don't need to meet Grace because Grace is in us we are that expression of his grace man unless of the things he has said to us Isaiah 40 29 he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak Isaiah 40 31 but those who opened the Lord will renew their strength they will swear on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint 43 says when you pass through the waters I will be with you and when you pass through the rivers they will not sweep over you when you walk through the fire you will not be burned the Flames will not set you Ablaze Jeremiah 29 11 said for I know the plans I have for you that cleanse the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future you love him this morning do you want more of those promises I should remind you more of them all right Deuteronomy 3 1 8 he said the Lord himself goes before you and will be with you what is it that you want what is that obstacle in front of you what is that dream that you have that looks like you cannot achieve what is that path that you are on that looks like something has stopped it said the Lord himself goes before you and will be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you don't be afraid don't be discouraged Joshua 1 9. have I not commanded you wow you know what God was trying to do to Joshua he was trying to point Joshua away from having confidence in himself to having confidence in God you know in my local language they used to say that the person we fear is not the person who sends the message is the person that sends you the message that you feel let me kind of explain that if the Paul asked me to go and tell brother bear is something maybe it's not something for the very ones to hear I'm not responsible for that message I'm only a carrier of the message the person that takes responsibility for it is the person that sends the messenger so what God was saying to Joshua I am the one that commanded you you are not going in your might this is not about you it is not your decision and it's not a decision to be here or not in the first place it was God's decision but Abraham said Hallelujah but Abraham said that the natural birth is more miraculous than the Virgin birth that in the millions of that seed God could determine that this actual one is the one that will meet the egg and will form you in your mother's womb talk about predestination we are not here by Mystic God didn't just bring us here I mean sometimes we look at our lives and because we have a very short-sighted view of what is going to happen in the future we we we we think that things are just you know happening the way the way that just by chance but this is a purposeful design by God when you go to a house that's been built if you've never seen the plan I'm not a builder I know where the brother Poland for the very kind of actually corrects me on this but if you've never seen the plan you go in there you just think things are happening or they put a wall here oh wow that looks nice sometimes you might even question it why they put a wall here but the Builder is following a plan if you are not aware of the plan you think it's just doing it by guesses it's just making a guess and just putting things and just you know making on the spot decision Our Lives is not designed that way God has a plan anything that happens in our life is not an on the spots decision it's a decision that was made before the foundation of the world I'm not talking about the good things only even the bad things has been put there by Design he said have I not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be afraid do not be discouraged at the time that God was given Joshua this and I know brother has taken time to you know go through that the past a couple years you know about adoption and what happened and how Joshua parallels Ephesians but we know that Joshua had just been given the task that was bigger than him it was going to fit into shoes that his feet were too small for so he had every right to be afraid there was every you will understandable if he was out of Courage if he had no courage at all because the the servant of God Moses that great man had just been taken away and then he the servant of Moses you know that's how the Bible described it said when Moses the servant of God have been taken away then Joshua the servant of Moses God spoke to him and God was telling don't be discovered for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go whether you feel the presence or not he is with you Psalm 23 4 even though I walk through the darkest Valley the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me the road to show me the direction the staff to correct me when I'm wrong they are both Comforts to me Philippians 4 6 to 7 says do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus Matthew 6 31-33 said don't worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need damn hey man you know that's hard to tell someone that probably lost their job because you'll be anxious it's natural but when you step out away from understanding or or thinking that this is all about your plans and how you have you know how how you've planned it out and and the things that you expect will happen and the situations you've analyzed and know that it's about God then the anxiety will go and if I could give a personal testimony when I lost my job last year April it was tough it was tough to think about we're living on savings for how long will this be for I literally gave God a deadline and said God you know what this is a good plan let's do this you know let me get another job in one month and that will just be pretty fine but that was not God's plan God needed me to go through a five month of training of going through different emotions emotions of doubts emotions of pain emotions of confusion to the point where I wondered if it was God's will for us to have been in Canada knowing that God had actually said go forward and I will be with you but God shook me through that journey and got me to a point where I now had no more anxiety I remember I was having a conversation with Brother John you know he came around or has a job application going on and at some point I said to him you know what God knows the job I'm going to take God has planned it out God knows when it will happen and God will take care of us from this point to that time is going to happen and there's nothing that will be out of cater and when it happens I will be grateful for all other rejections that I have had because God will make the best choice that is the privilege we have as the children of God what what is it are we going to read that let me just continue this you know I want to close soon Matthew 6 I was reading 31-33 he said for the pagans run after those things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but as something he said we shall seek after he said but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well Proverbs 3 5-6 say trust in the Lord with all your hearts and lean North on your own understanding one of the things that Satan wants us to do is lean on our understanding he wants us to lean on our understanding of ourselves of who we think we are he wants us to lean on our understanding of who we think we are and anything you think you are that is different from what God thinks you are is just a label your liberal is different from your identity your true identity is what God has said you are and when God has said it nothing changes it the only thing is that when I look away from the identity that God has said is mine then I'm depriving myself of the blessings of God don't lean on your own understanding in all your ways submit to him and it will make your paths straight Matthew 7 9 11 Jesus speaking here he said which of you if your son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish we'll give him a snake if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children not just gifts good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gift to those who ask him if you have asked he's going to give it to you is he taking time don't don't worry he has the perfect timing not only does he have the perfect timing he has the perfect way sometimes all God is just doing is teaching you patience and what is patience is a total surrender to the will of God to the ways of God and to the time of God teaching you that full surrender amen you know if there's anything you want to ask for God to give to you just be prepared for it you know asking God to give you patience it takes a lot sometimes we use your spouse to teach you patience sometimes your children sometimes situations but can you be totally surrendered to the will of God to the ways of God how God wants it done to the time of God when he wants it done it will give you whatever you ask him second Corinthians 9 8 and God is able to bless you abundantly so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work God is able to bless you abundantly Psalm 34 10 he said the Lions May grow weak and hungry but those who seek the Lord will lack no good thing I've just revealed to you this morning brothers and sisters some of the things we have in this arcade that has been given to us there are so many more of them let's explore it and the one I would you know read finally is Romans 8. 30-39 there's something that ever makes you feel dejected just go to this scripture he said moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and only called then we also Justified and only Justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us many times we wonder we bother about those that are against us but one with God is the majority Hallelujah when you are with God let the entire world turn against you you're still in the majority he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things then he said You shall separate us from the love of Christ who shall separate us he gave a few examples shall tribulation or distress or persecution or farming or nakedness or Peril or sword and I'll say all temptation or failures is there something you can do that will make you be separated from the love of God if you are an elect of God he said nay in all things we have more than conquerors through him that loved us could not you know find other examples but you just wanted to put all all of it together and he said neither no he said he said they know things your modern conquerors dream that lovers um I'm sorry I think I missed the verse they'll just turn to that scripture and read it I know where Bible students and we know it none of the states he said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus alone nothing shall separate us I'll ask the musicians to come got two more quotes to read the expression of the grace of God in this end time we are special people we don't feel like it and in this court I'm going to read about the brown acknowledges that we don't feel like it this is from the church book Ephesians Church age but the RAM said you know we're speaking about the seven golden candlesticks he said in Exodus 25 31 it says and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beating work shall the Candlestick be made is shafts and these branches his balls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same now but the brand said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness sometimes we want to create our own righteousness it's not acceptable when God is looking at you is not seeing you is seeing Christ he's seen the perfect sacrifice her attributes are his own glorious attributes our identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in heart [Music] are you hearing something about yourself this morning there is no fault in her you might see the false but he does not see it [Music] she's all glorious within and without whose reports will you believe this morning whose report are we going to believe any contrary report brothers and sisters is Satan's reports [Music] we must get to that stage that will start to refute anything Satan says even if our senses confirm that it is the truth [Music] but Abraham said when this bride we realize who she is then she will become an invincible Army an army that cannot be conquered Satan knows that the secret lives with our realizing who she is and he continuously attacks our identity making artists believe our identity there is no fault in her she's all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all this works are perfect [Music] he said in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God in this bride in you my brother in you my sister is the summation of the Eternal plan of God didn't we read it that all that have gone beyond the curtain of time all these years over the years they are not perfect without us [Music] in our summed up and manifested internal reason and purpose of God the Bible said how can one fathom it how can one understand it Joe will cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God had spokenets we can't fathom it we can't understand it but one thing we can do we can accept it by faith because why God spoke it [Music] the Patmos vision foreign do not fear don't fear a little flock all that I am [Music] you are here to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear or failure but love and courage and ability all power is given me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail [Music] We rise up with me this

God we sing one more song today maybe two we only just about 12 o'clock we could probably sing a few more I know it's not easy at home but when you get in his presence It's just tough to stop my goodness I'd like to sing Standing on the Promises of God if we could but as we tee that up just a couple of points that uh I believe were really good keys that we heard this morning I believe the Lord spoke to us and I trust that we'll have years to hear some of the things that he said you know brother Toby said I am pleased to know that he does not rely upon me for his promise to come to pass in our lives did you catch that point when he said that your label is different than your identity each one of these I feel like we could take a a long discussion many times our Earthly presence what we get into in our lives what we do here on Earth can become who we are and we begin to forget who we're supposed to be we forget who he sees us as because whatever it is that we do becomes our very essence and that's wrong and that's where God allows us to get into trials to get our attention to start to flip over all the stones in our lives and say Lord what's going on why the trial but it's so that we can remember that our label here on Earth is irrelevant it's absolutely irrelevant it's our identity and how we contend with such a plague of identity theft on this Earth if you look at it naturally and brother Bradham said the natural types of spiritual hate goodness sakes how Satan wants to take our identity I feel like we could just get started brother I'm telling you I was inspired today Hallelujah oh Standing on the Promises of Christ my king through Eternal ages let his Praises Ring glory in the highest I will shout and sing Standing on the Promises of God Standing on the Promises of God my savior standing standing Standing on the Promises of God Standing on the Promises that cannot fail when the howling storms of The Fearless of God shall Prevail Standing on the Promises of God standing standing Standing on the Promises of God my savior standing standing I'm Standing on the Promises of God Standing on the Promises I now can see perfect present cleansing in the blood for me standing in the Liberty where Christ makes free Standing on the Promises of God my savior standing standing Standing on the Promises of God Standing on the Promises of Christ the lord bound to him eternally by love strong cord overcoming daily with the spirit sword Standing on the Promises of God standing standing Standing on the Promises of God my savior standing stand Sunday Monday are Standing on the Promises of God Hallelujah I feel like I could just keep singing that song we heard about those promises today what a tremendous God we serve let's just bow in prayer

leave this meeting different than when we came that we would just have a spring in our step knowing that you don't look at us the way that we look at ourselves you look at us the way that you created

that you love us and nothing can pluck us from your hand father we just love you and we thank you for your grace and for your mercy and your expression of your grace down Through the Ages Lord because
