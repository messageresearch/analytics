Lord foreign [Music] amen um welcome tonight um welcome to the house of God once again um so tonight of I want to thank God for what we have yeah I mean we're looking at something here in California sometimes we don't know what's going on Google Now we have many stars who are wonderful ministers who whenever they come here to speak to us we we are always happy that we are going to hear something from them we have a pastor who's also a nice person [Music] I mean who are the working tirelessly to make sure that this truck stands we have like Henry who comes here almost every time environment [Music] everywhere [Music] and God who said um how wonderful things from Dragon to drug together in unity you may not understanding yourself in your congregation when you're gonna have one of the things that you have here you know um before when the focus of the screen is not known as news the company as you can do and sometimes um that's conventions and convention was because the project is normal and what happens when something happens when God's brother or that sister is remember God in your midst of that person got every joints of life in the body of Christ through every joint of life it is not just the minister of Supply every project has something to do and that will show God everything is good encourage one another right so this is like um somehow will be more on understanding the severity of God and so I would want us to open our Bible to musica chapter 14. black history in the heart things since I've been incredible again therefore stick onto them and say unto them call say the Lord God every man of the House of Israel the second office before he sings and comment to the prophet I belong I do not I the Lord will answer him the comment according to the multitude of his idols that I am expecting House of Israel in their own house because they are all extreme for me to the idols therefore say unto the house of Israel because thanks and calling yourself from idols Francis from all your Abominations for everyone in the house of Israel for me and second organizing in his heart Improvement is coming Lord of iniquity before he saved and come back to his Prophet to inquire of him concerning me I the Lord will answer him by myself and I will set my faith against God's mind I will make him shine as include them and I will cut him off from the myth of my people and yes I know that I am the Lord when he has spoken a thing I do not have diffused that prophet and I will sort out my heart upon him I will destroy him from the midst of My People Israel and they shall get the punishment of that iniquity punishment of the president from England as a punishment of him that should get unto me one to five foreign and all those things have been through the Lord but to this man when I look even to him that is Paul I'm not a Contracting and tremended at my world Mission and since he offered flying blood and he left an idol yeah they have closing their own wings and the Soul delighted in your abomination was so I I do not I also include their delusion because when I called London's answer when I think they did not hear that they didn't even before my eyes and close God in which I believe amen so um okay um um and so I foreign this evening though I don't I don't want to think myself I want the whole thing to speak why because um a man can refuse nothing exactly to him for my days now we had a prophet that was sent to them and then they had many problems and then Israel they have the word of most responsive to them they had the temple they had everything that they needed they they had the laws all that was given to them and so they have come to a point where they have they get they see themselves as the only people and so you come to a point Israel they no longer have any encounter or the kind of don't associate anybody who is not an Israelite I hope they become so much self-like loss to employ to God when they make sacrifices for their sins it wasn't from the heart but because it is something we have to do and so if I want to commit adopt me I will go and die in good and cook and then go and communicate go through again sacrifice the group I know and that was not the problems of the law the Lord will guide them for them to live a life plus life but there's always a transaction to whatever God do for people and so it became a norm until it came to a point that these people they had no fear for God's prophet that that they will come to a close like the the living make up their minds on what to do so we are coming to that government I don't know nothing to Mark the prospect or maybe go to get the process opinion the one o'clock is going to say it's not going to our own car it wasn't already have in mind and therefore the Lord program if any of your game comes to you or anybody and he has an ugly heart he has already left his life on what to do now I'm not together now I belong you tell him exactly exactly he wants to hear foreign why because that man first of all a message was presented to him because to link it to him in the world that he cannot deny yet he decided to Delight that message no that this was the state of Israel I remember as you speak English right now so when I'm speaking don't think about Israel don't be thinking about yourself this conversation that is thinking about it from her no let me come from Noah in the time of newer now the truth is that Noah is not entitled right because of God we know that Enoch was the type of device nothing you have to understand something degrees of Enoch Enoch was the only one with restaurant something happened at that period that the source of God saw the doctors of men that's when we are fair so and then it happened today let's continue from where I was before I thought that became a lingering you know that before that time there was a focal distinction between the seed of God and he doesn't happen right and one thing that we understand that would happen is that it has a regular spirit in it because God himself as a delightful care and take another season so it's not about having the greatest advantages look inside of him and not I cannot it's not receptive to the world I'm coming from where but government now you see Enoch is this was that thought he didn't tell us that God [Music] if if you believe in the last seven things I believe in the last challenge and the only way you can have that faith in that sleeping God I love that it was by faith and so and not have something that is good look for the heart and if that was the requirement for that time this is also the retirement for today yoga retirement you see the bathroom is so open to the messenger William that we know all these things well it is not just in millions because in the time of anger they have to learn it too and so when Enoch was last Club got all stress we are corrupted uh welcome Google and that's how it was going to be in our time and we understand that in the days of Noah that is oh and so the message that Angels received all flesh will just missions and when God sent the message of God yes the God is a god of God why is he a ghost blog that is why you need to understand foreign because for him to be a God of Justice it means that the good things must live on the same ground for them to make a choice now the God died for knowledge okay not that God said no God died for knowledge he knows because that this figure makes because of where it came from what oh if God and King he had Adam So Adam please again the whole Council of God and so we saw that as we are growing up group of them had revealed for God we follow him quickly doing a hard-working they were doing the best they can do and then pain was violent the nuclear the same way as well because once when you come was that sick and the other religion interpretation of what Adam said so even though God will served God to hang to hear from God directly relationship thank you sacrifice him and kill him okay this is not the time to sacrifice I want so it wasn't somebody who was a relation from God like that you know God when God called me business not Lord I want from you even God told me did you know she was as well did so don't but God do not only like okay nothing told me exactly what to do God you see when um when you plant when you apply to me in your farm again uh they are all working for the rain to fall right again when we went falls down on it the men will remain right okay now when word of God came to every girl and King in American expressions the first that came to his mind wasn't killing a girl 10 months the thought the first thing that came to him was I have to kill yourself mother and then he came back the next thing was no conscience and God asking him where is Israel because of my my brother Kruger where did he get this thing from because it is you can't change it and then the next thing of the dog clothing and God asked him and after God has given him because I said God is a human being painters nothing but yet he was in that talk of Adam now we see that we moved down to the grace of Noah this is what the meaning of sins has not Resort again as the whole flesh was corrupt before God and then God found a new account drink in the cycle club now I'm trying to bring to people now when when Noah you go lure was because [Music] of mine was continually written it was it was a progressive resolution of wickedness progression that's the way I'm coming here wickedness disguise some of the things that the government goals look at some of the things as you speak with God if you're going to know how they are able to think that wickedness how do they how do you imagine that kind of evil oh God and then that was how he falls in the time of Noah and if we if you look at the the family of King you will see the first things you got me on Earth the drugs are different kind of music the music industry The Entity it's good unions [Music] no when you are when God came to mewah I told them you are this new career has come before me I I want to start I'm going to destroy this whole world you are understanding the presently of God for 120 years he was speaking to solve that kind of things why was you are cooking because Noah understood the severity of God foreign [Music] going to happen you it was going to be a terrible thing it was going to be a terrible Act of God not the best of God so you are kept thinking day and night every time as your feet you are crying because the devil said that the wickedness and the answer that was so much that it gives the heart of God foreign because sometimes in our spirits of work what we've been using that's what I'm saying this thing because if we understand the sovereignty of God if you understand what is the government of conducation you don't care if that person will be saved a lot it could be a utmost responsibility to preach to that person that's what I'm saying no let me consider my camera but before I before I come to this point now we see that because in time when when new I was going to speak to why he was speaking he was making an ark what and then it was time because Lewis Nations did not make any sense and you always thinking this message to people who knows what is our students so when you are going to put the house but but they haven't met the god of Noah now I want to make a scripture here will also 17 and weakness is someone who has had effect s for him to be a weakness or something you must regret when nothing happened if not you are not a witness of that for you to be a weakness of Christ it is not someone that told me or my grandfather told me no you will hunt to a point where you must be affect hand weakness of Christ sometimes and so these people in a time of newer the New York you are saying look they have never left the god of Noah they never never when no one came into the position that God told me to bring an ark it is going to rain what you are saying it's not it's not in the Bible but what he saw that's why we have to be certain of God Paul speaking he said give diligence to make your calling as a lesson so diligence diligence means take out time take out time to make sure that you have salvation here okay see anything God Is So humble God is so sincere that you will always stick to me back but most times you don't do that we don't even spend time in the place of Prayer we must take time you it wasn't nothing I'm taking you most times go to the mountains spend time with God we can't do that but we want to operate in The Legend Of God that's wonderful now remember these people want 28 they rejected the message of Miller but in the mind you're talking and getting lower because [Music] the god of Noah and so I I got because even from the animals had animals animals they have washing machine and human beings did not get that money that is we are and now this camera it was God who came down and shot the ark now you are talking your mind it was it go forward to Massachusetts so how come they did not have access to the Earth because it was God himself does not work now it is not the act of God because they have crossed the light because of God's picking the message um then you can cross the line and when you cross that line God was working um when it was so good that's right and that looks like he he cried for it so when you got us again that is how it could bring our time in the kind of structure they have no Bible we have no Gaggle together any kind of Freedom they don't have many courses that we have to do however Sodom they met Abraham entitled of like knock knock let me let me guess something here that's why I don't move to Southern Rock wasn't as I have and then what time issues um soon it will always come get me point of decision this Christianity will always come down it will always going down to a point of decision and your decision is because of who you were before the working time God that will always be the point of decision to see your points tells us who you are and so I I love look at the connection together I think sugar it was well workered you know the way that you you look at making you know it's so beautiful so that is where I'm going to again the next one love did not he did not go to show them sugar so this is shutdown so look when you started that snagging he said in his heart I cannot I cannot go into sugar so I'm still close but without thought that when when the 1980s came look was close to Southern he was now so good no Google coming to destruction again I have to speak to my friends as I have oh are you a friend of God you know why why ask questions Abraham in in the height of God so remarkable recommend to God that when God wants to do something not this is not to exercise God wants to do something to eat different foreign so Google negotiating with money now it came down to 10. if the igorithms came transition drugs again is my culture so if Southern has not found itself in the same condition that we also saw in the time of newer We Are All Flesh oh and because God has determined Sodom for Destruction those two angels were sent to such trouble and when there was a good the Ranger and the first thing they take us to Blind soda equaling the devil because this man have rejected the gospel the next thing was God deniving them him so this is not the act of the devil for the act of God for for organization that understands the god of Heaven and Earth no this is very families it has now we let uh for those I mean I want to encourage everyone of us to at least everywhere you try to look like one tough guy in the Bible it will help me a lot and sometimes um try to encourage yourself to like look like the whole group in your room because I look like marking in a week first drawing in a week you know and other students health will cancel a lot no Ahab I'm trying to one guy because look at everything I'm saying I'm not trying to show my opinion I'm trying to say walk through the word of God now we have Ahab the guy who make us understand that it had was so wicked that that he he caught it was a small thing to Manchester who was the daughter of Ecuador so it had it has understood politician and so he wanted to he had this inspiration that he can mind the doctor of his kingdom from that other part into you know I would have a good position we will have a good Commonwealth this country we have a good uh reverse from super god country you know that we can have allies like that you know because business number and so it had When government came they had 800 Prophets the first 400 foreign in Israel and so we had a liger who was exactly what we are supposed to do today men who are not afraid of whoever can do because when when Elijah came before Ahab in 3017 right before wife when he was before Ahab he took a house of I am standing before my God so I'm not going to seeing you the world now don't it had went ahead nothing and then if nothing came to him and closing you are going to die this like this will happen to you the Bible says repentance now let's let's I want to make something there God forgive him yet in all these atrocities where he thanked God forgive him again what happened there he went back I did not make you like that is activated something that night as the moment he crossed that line a little was held in heaven you see I I don't think it's time for a half to die in time so what are we going to do it yeah is he um [Music] foreign everything 400 but this is this is now God the act of God not the devil not mine what are we going to do for this Ahab and there's a consensus in heaven against him foreign [Music] God I am telling you and so when you saw a house Prophet prophesied they actually saying this one the reaction under an inspiration and then there was also another inspiration on Ahab and that was um was in Romans chapter 1. I I wasn't part of God and I'll beat them up overcome and that was the anointing that also came on that one is done with that Prophet I I know why no he doesn't tell me what I want to hear and so God has anointed this 400 process together what he wants to hear and he's a prophet the disease you know that I do not have deceived that prophet of God because a heart has been given up to a liquid mind to send nine thousand King that cannot receive the word of God he despised that prophet but it took an anointing of God upon him for his personal destruction the very word of God no work there in Israel romance chapter one another one again and the rest of London according God is not the devil number yes eyes that they should not see and yes that they should not hear until this day now I I I'm going to line up one thing I have to make this because over 2 000 years they are working for Christ all the life because we we understand that from the promise of Adam from the fall of Adam when God promised The Shield to Abraham in the land of Moriah where he wanted to sacrifice Isaac that received was 2 000 years from from that from that point of Christ on that same thing was another 2 000 years I will say that when Christ came the people who have been working for him for 2 000 years they were the ones that crucified him well then then crucified him even in Jerusalem the same people who have all their life have been discussing all that they have done everything who have all the process and there's nothing for the Messiah to come but because the the possession of what the Messiah would be is not what we are seeing it was decent people just crucified him but you not think that it is the act of the devil no it is God put this number in their eyes because of the Gentiles who he was don't crucify him if you are telling you that because the Bible tells us to wait to shall see his death and is causing the death of Adam there was one who was meant to take away your sin and who who is that so when Christ came he came to fulfill that scripture to tell the wages of faith that for him having on the cross to that guy he now became sin not that he was a singer but he became saying that we may become the righteousness of Christ go for him to become sin it was his own people that's not working for him that had to crucify him and then Paul now said something he said wow no don't sit there the glasses were broken off because I am at the Jack again because of underneath they are broken off and that started I think do not hide my God yeah so I'm speaking to us now so I'm down to our time be not high-minded book yeah for if God not the natural thank you take him he also can't knock you the whole example the goodness and his very clear of God goodness is conditional if thou continue in his goodness otherwise and then also is a God blessing of the leaf has drafted in so God is angry could drop them in again now where are we now you move outside here you this city Canada does not look like a city but wasn't happening [Music] now so if that were hooked out of honestly this is why by nickel I would love that no you have just a contrary to Nature into a good honestly speaking here when you left a lying orange tree to mention the natural activities that the the right or listening will introduce live truth when Gentiles were adjusted into that body the Gentiles those who have the Holy Ghost not produce the fruit of the Holy Ghost nature that what we have to do something it's not um it's like an orange thing and then you have uh you have different kind of stuff and guys how to do how to learn more and they are eating some of the orange and when it comes time to produce fruit they will have to give oranges no because this nothing came from and so and that is how we have to go get many group of people just get to get to the real word of God the anointing of the day And yet when you come for them to produce yourself it is this genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost Matthew 24. they are false Christ the real anointing that look false the real anointing they are eating the genuine word of God there's nothing in them world foreign why do you think these things are happening at this time it is a time of my quality of both things there are things that are enormous thing you cannot even here with you because now you see them on screen on TV set 30 years ago 16 years ago 100 years ago if you it was enough domination for for one to tell you or imagine Google here is a normal thing to hear why because of my calling so what is happening to the weak now is the week I do not support myself too because it is also a majority of the week who are supposed to stand against the Israel of the day amen and that was the point because when we talk about experience something has to squeeze something you you can't be hidden um nothing chapter five you when you when you like to understand it has no use this has no news for you to understand what is you not understand the sweetness of the orange doesn't send people now do not see the genuine Christianity even though they will not accept it even though they will not accept it because Christ was in that position that he was pleased and all that came out of perfect love and that woman sent to them no that's not my father when he looked at him as a cross when he was dying he said truly this is the son of God because that's why he saw was beyond what he has seen all his life but yet to many people who are there it is not good salvation to them no um you have to conclusive methodology and then Gathering you together first the task exactly it must have to be discussed first and you start forming you to a communical council and and all these councils and councils and councils and even even councils it is still the same kind of the United States thousands upon councils what is happening is Gathering of the cars and God is gathering them for importance because they have to gather before we can be cast into the furnace you also understand that when when you Prospect in this day of speaking they are also sent a good blanking angels I thought what we have today is is I mean if a solution of the effect of the grinding and so describing has been moving down some General Circle generation and so when we have the people who are more blinded than in the father's way and so what do we have now today we have people in the United States you you you you have to leave God he said we are many but and then he was in the mountain he was far away is crying I was crying for salvation but today we have them in the offices the Imagine for him to call them damn good even that same demon if if it is now in in the government it is now in everywhere and he's not telling you what to do why because the weak because I'm not calling because this is the devil or he's walking into prepare himself to set the substance of sentence either and this evening must be perfected the investor sessions the devil will not understand how the government foreign amen why because that is an anointing and that anointing is dependent on what seeds is inside the tension amen now inclusion now some some myself holy spirit of God upon your question I need their Force yeah and things are so signs of Wonders in some of that if if you defeat the very electric if it were possible and their Anointed with genuine hosting the Lord now are in closing okay let me call the musician not inclusive because salvation once the mission of iniquity the the second illusion of godliness now delivers in literacy is just opposite of the mystery of godliness the mission of godliness is called manifested in this yes of the devil manifested and distress now this mystery already work now as as far as speaking it was already working but it was actually six days right here and then shall do because of the field from the Lord shall continue Blackness was coming even him who's coming after the working of Franklin and all towers and psychological universities because when you seek not the Lord or the truth that game I could say and for this horse God send them wrong delusion that they should believe in life why because they all might be damned who believes not the truth but had pleasure in the righteousness now also God also God also gave a lot to us cleanliness true disasters of Their Own Heart themselves I will not come anything nothing to understand is that this city is getting right for total discussion this is going to see when you see these things happening do not associate yourself with any form of it because this is a sign that this city is already Under the Desert of God and maybe because maybe we are more than 10 because don't close Abraham into your thing I will not destroy no look at what they are doing all right and once you can celebrate your mother to Crystal now in this city the Halloween the weather the present Halloween and so many eye Targets in so many so many angles Washington stuff in this country again okay the next one so this course Allah for even the women they change the National Youth into that with International women and women buying any kind of things and likewise also the leg management I'm glad use of women born in the Lord one to one another men with men walking god with his unfilling when they said this thing do not know how how filthy they are and we're feeling themselves that which contains of the error which of me third one and even though they did not like to detain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reproduce mind the reason why I'm saying these things because on Saturday I went to downtown after he went to assist and then delivers nothing else I I understand I wanted the ashamed of my faith because the people have no regard when they have broken God for us they have no respect for The God Who understanding for God it is gone and then when we find ourselves and that is where the world is moving to because the gospel is going to leave the Gentiles touching the truth and governor of the Gospel here from us Massachusetts Association we've come to a point where um you cut internet to drink I mean

your place of work everything in construction um a different kind of work that I understand other stuff because I'm coming to another organization the same thing you cannot avoid it because we are in this world but we are not off and therefore we have to be ambassadors so what I'm saying is that even young people they are 10 years nine years seven years in your schools thanks for what to believe
