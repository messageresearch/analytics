there is more and um that song says that we're going to call him Brother Don you can just come um and then we'll call him sister Amber after that but the song says you've been good to me you've been so good to me but I believe there is more I believe there's more things more Miracles More wonders more things you want to use me for and I believe that should be our desire this year that should use us more than ever before all of us have gifts and talents right and we want to use those gifts and talents for God may God use those gift and talents for him like never before this year in Jesus name Brother Don please [Music] come amen Lord bless you all I didn't feel like coming to church today didn't feel feel like lifting my hands and worship to the Lord and then when we're worshiping smile came on my face and I had to lift my hands and praise my Lord sometimes it's easy to praise the Lord when you feel inspired we don't just serve and love our Lord when he's good to us or when we think he's being good to us even when we don't feel like it lift your hands and watch the blessing he'll give you this has been on my heart for a couple of weeks it's a poem called gift of faith why cry my weary Soul when strength resides within God Called Moses reminding him to begin he had been chosen commissioned Egypt's doomes day to speak with authority God's purpose to convey Moses speak I'm ready to display my power to move mountains to make all obstacles cower why cry to me I've equipped your very being speak and watch the enemies before you fleeting Moses had forgotten maybe doubt or momentary fear but God's nudging reminder made his vision clear Samson understood by his locks of Might God's covenant by judges Israel's real wrongs WR it Joshua too in battles Fierce and Grand understood the power resting in God's command why cry unto me just speak my child I've given you Authority be bold not mild flies and fleas creation and all were spoken when they obeyed the call so why oh why do we cry and plead when God's word is within us the Original Seed speak my friends from confident stronghold for by your voice Miracles are promised to unfold no need to holler beg or groan simply speak with conviction and see potentials fully shown the realization oh my oh how I love it so when we grasp the truth and truly let it flow The Promise by our mouths when backed by faith will move Every Mountain and conquer any wraith so let us continue let us not continue to cry yes in humbl and helplessness abide but speak with authority in knowing we're taken from his very side he has given us the authority to Simply stand and shape word Reality by uttering the command why do you cry my friend is God's voice not within speak and watch the very fulfillment begin with faith as our guide the path is clear just speak and observe as God's power declares Lord bless you [Applause] [Music] all good morning everyone and God bless um wow Brother Don what you just said so ties in with what I've been going through just recently and um I just wanted to take a little opportunity to um give a testimony to while I stand here um and uh God called on my heart this morning comforted me with the song He Touched Me and I thought it was so applicable to the um to the things that I've been going through my prayer my desire is so much for my family for my children and um you folks know because I have sent out a message on the assembly WhatsApp and um my my daughter my youngest daughter for the second time this week she said I want to go with you to church mom and you know she she will be here one day and um before I forget sister tell I want to say thank you for to you for coming up here and giving testimony and singing your songs for showing me that example and um coming back to what I was saying my my granddaughter um she took a an interest finding out about the nativity scene she took an interest and was wanting to learn more about Jesus I wanted to respectfully ask my middle daughter for permission to talk with her um and to bring her to church she wants to come to church too she's six years old and so um I respectfully asked and um and I also said can I share Bible stories and can I share children's songs because many in my family are probably somewhat close to being atheist in their beliefs and so um I respectfully asked and I was declined I found that out this morning all week long there was silence and and I didn't have opportunity to speak to them in person at the time that I was last with them and so I just sent a text and there was silence all week long there was no answer this morning that answer came and it was no and so a comfort came over me and I've been in this church and I witnessed his sister up front here who used to come through the side door with her walker and now she came with her son and he was baptized in this church and I claimed them that that day that that strength came into me and witnessing that sister had that experience and I know for me you know I was brought up in in this Faith as a Believer my father was an evangelist some of you know that and for 35 years I I set it all aside and that desire came back to me from God because for 35 years I knew he existed but you know he was he was just there and when I began to read my Bible it really touched me and that desire came back and it's you know it was non-existent for 35 years so um I just felt that this morning he touched me because I was given this strength in in my being that it didn't tear me up to hear my daughter say no because I know I've claimed her and like my mother claimed me and applied the token over me before she passed away and here I stand that my children will be here all of them will be here everyone in my family will be here and so I just was just so at peace and I was able to answer back and say that's okay it's okay cuz I have a peace and knowing that my God is behind me and he is with them and that's just amazing that I would be here to say this to you folks 35 something years later you know my mom had passed when I was about 9 or 10 and she applied that token over me before she passed and here I am so Hallelujah I just wanted to share that story with you and you know brother dawn is what he said why cry I anybody around me has seen me crying every time I'm in church singing I think there's a variety of reasons I don't know why I probably won't make it through this song without crying so please help me out too but um yeah this is not a gift that I have to sing but we grew up singing in church my sister was always the one who could sing and play the piano and be musical but I'm just going to give it a little try cuz Dad used to make me come up front and and sing so um I'm don't know what uh What uh key I sing and but I know the musicians will help me figure that out and I think I'll start with the course and um yeah thanks for having the music up on the prompter so he touched me oh he touched me and oh the joy that floods my [Music] soul something happened and now I know oh he touched me and made me [Music] whole Shackled by a heavy burden neath the load of G and [Music] shame then the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no longer the same he touched me oh he touched me and oh the joy that fills my [Music] soul something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole since I met this [Music] blessed savior since he cleansed and made me whole I shall never cease to praise him I'll shout it while he turn it rooll he touch me oh he Touch Me Lord and oh I know he touched me and he made [Applause] me amen amen God bless you Brother Don God bless you Sister Amber thank you that song was actually on my initial list and for some reason I took it out I

night to get here this morning God richly bless you as well Hebrews chapter 12 start with verse one wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set

beside ourselves Lord and allow you to minister to us father we just commit the rest of this service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated Happy New Year to every everyone we're certainly thankful for the goodness of the lord we did it a little bit different this year and we didn't have a watch Night Service and I think that was all right we were able to have some fellowship I personally think it's real important to not get too comfortable into a set routine and uh just to allow the spirit of the Lord to have Liberty we can get in a rut and have a a bunch of tradition and it can just become what we do not what we really believe and I just think it's so good to take a look at the world from a few different angles and you know this year coming up I'm not saying we won't have a a watch Night Service we might we'll just see what the Lord wants maybe we won't even get to New Year's Lord willing and we'll just have a resurrection and Rapture all that all of the Saints had ever looked towards we might actually see someone's going to be alive on Earth to actually witness that to actually be the literal manifestation of that body change brothers and sisters someone is going to do that why not you just a couple of announcements this morning we've got prayer meetings coming up this month this uh Thursday the 11th and the 25th is a Thursday also at 7:30 p.m. here at the church we've got the youth meeting I believe on the 21st we're going to have a communion service on the 28th as well if you have any questions by all means reach out uh you could see these I think reflected on our website as well on the calendar potion portion so um if you have any questions just let us know as uh mentioned as well on the group chat there is the food delivery downstairs and uh what a tremendous blessing that is proving to be and you know I just would like to be real clear I'm definitely a part of it but vicariously I I I would like to say that I I've done lots for it and and to make it happen and I've helped out I would say a little bit but you know what it is it's my wife and I I I think [Applause] that I just want to mention that she's the one that's been driving this we found out that we could get this food for animals and and you know some of the locations the food isn't really good and it's just fit for animal consumption but here we found that we can actually get some that is actually available for human consumption that that the store actually gives away so that people can eat it and they encourage that and if you're a charity uh you're able to actually participate in that so as soon as we heard that um my wife if you've ever seen what she does she gets after something she she kept asking until she was able to get that one particular store where it's all it is is human consumption food and there's stuff in there that's not really good but for the most part it's going to be something that will be for a blessing to the body and you know I I I've had people mention that you know maybe your wife should be quiet and she shouldn't say anything but I I just want to say this brothers and sisters if you've ever read proverbs 31 it talks about a woman that is up and doing not just a a quet subservient doormat of a wife someone that's actually involved actively looking after her family and the community around and you know I I find myself saying this and people might be saying brother Barry you're really going off about your wife but I want tell you brothers and sisters that's the greatest thing outside of my salvation that God could have gave me sitting right here so I am going to brag I think we have the opportunity to if God's ever given you a good wife you could say the same thing you know it so I'd like to take some credit for it but all the credit goes to my wife and God brothers and sisters if you have any questions by all means reach out I'm pretty involved with it but I mean she's the one that's been been doing it I I lend her my truck and she goes to get it and then she brings it to the church or she brings it back home again so um We're In It Together Hallelujah God bless you honey I love you I want to spend a little bit of time brothers and sisters talking about leadership as we head into 2024 you know uh I believe with all my heart that in order for us to be successful in our Christian walk we have got to have leadership in our lives and you know we can look at leadership from so many different aspects so many different ways um I want to look at leadership for us I I I'd like to look at leadership with us maybe from a Grace perspective instead of a legalistic perspective and I think sometimes they can be a little bit confused and even in and around the message of the hour some folks will say that you know because of my good works I've got strong leadership and that's true that's true but do you have Grace because sometimes when you see people starched out with their good works they don't have a lot of Grace and they're pretty eager to point fingers at people and say look at this about that and that about the other and you know what that's not leadership that's dictatorship we're not into dictatorship we're not into communism from the pulpit we're not into any of that what we're into is Grace the grace of God and you know what if we've ever experienced the grace of God in our lives truly there ain't no room for legalism legalism gets nowhere in our lives in fact the more revelated we become in our lives the more humble we become in our Christian walk because we recognize there's nothing we ever did but you know if you read just a little further back in Hebrew in uh not Hebrews in uh Proverbs it talks about the man that's puffed up vainly it talks about the hottie Spirit there's discussion about what happens before the fall of a man and and you know we can see it with our eyes we don't have to preach it but we have discernment in our lives and and we can see people that maybe just aren't as revelated as they would like to claim they are and you know as we go forwards in 2024 brothers and sisters I want to encourage us to get into Christ I'll say it every single service when you get into Christ you will have a different walk you'll have a different perception a different Persona in your life you know many times people get into the new year going into the new year they'll set new goals and they'll have many natural aspects to set the goals for and and it's very important to do that I would agree to that it it's a good thing to do set goals set targets set yourself a a a direction chart your course but don't make that more than your spiritual walk I would say set some spiritual goals first brothers and sisters set the spiritual goals first let that be what actually dictates your future the way that you go when I talk about leadership going into 2024 I I just felt so incredibly led to go down the road of leadership not just leadership in general as a broad statement there's many different aspects or or directions you can go with that but what I want to talk about is Direction in the family leadership in the family because leadership in the family is either going to make the family or it's going to break the family because that leadership is inherently there whether people want to accept it or whether they don't want to accept it the whole family looks to Daddy and if Daddy is absent in the family guess what the family is going to be led somehow is it going to be the children that just take control and say Mommy we want to do this and Mommy can't contain because she's just a single mom dad's busy doing his own thing he's not paying attention to what the children are doing there becomes a power vacuum and when that happens something's going to fill it right there's leadership always it's always there so who's going to lead is it going to be the children I remember brother Ken those people who were here back when brother Ken was ministering he said this world is set up exactly opposite of the way it was intended by God from the very beginning where it is God and then it is man and then it is wife and then it's children the world has flipped it upside down completely put the children at the top put the mom next put the dead and then Christ at the very bottom that's not the way it is in amongst the Christian Church though I'm not saying that I'm just saying in comparison to this world that's what we're up against the whole entire world is structured to per per to promote that kind of behavior and what a terrible thing that is so as we go forwards I just want to say let's set spiritual goals brothers and sisters about having leadership in our family and not just leadership to set goals and and do the natural thing and and exercise the the natural laws call it the natural laws of the Bible you can tithe and you'll be rewarded for it you can be a good citizen and shovel your neighbor's sidewalk and you'll be acknowledged and rewarded for it God's watching every single thing we do and you will see a blessing for those things brothers and sisters but what about actually coming to the place where we can say I am my father are one because when we get to that place we're going to live ourselves a different life and the people who are the closest to us are going to say you know what you're not just preaching it you're actually living it wow what's going on who are you and what have you done with my spouse or what have you done with my parents what's going on something's different in your life and what you'll be able to say is yeah just like we sang in that song we're so glad that we trusted in Jesus he's able to now sit down on the throne room of my heart and actually live his life through me and once in a while I have to preach and say yeah I believe the word of God what if we set goals brothers and sisters about about spiritual things yes amen about simply saying I'm going to actually spend a little bit more time in the word I I'm actually going to listen a little bit more to the message I I'm going to attend church just a little bit more I I'm going to actually maybe go to prayer meetings once in a while I I'm actually going to go to communion service and I'm not going to let anything stand in the way you know the devil just loves to keep us from communion service to say oh you've got this thing in your heart you better not go up there you're going to eat and drink damnation to yourself you're going to eat and drink dation to yourself if you don't go as Believers we have got to follow the word of God it's an ordinance to do and to be able to Humble ourselves one to another and wash our brother or sister's feet oh my goodness gracious I would say this we don't have a whole lot of Revelation if we're not doing that we can say we believe the message of the hour but we live it that's what shows that we actually believe the message of the hour you know brothers and sisters I want to take a a direction today and I I just felt led to go this way I hope it's okay um sometimes as a minister as a pastor it can feel maybe a little bit weird but here we go turn with me this morning to Acts chapter 5 amen I want to talk about leadership in the family our leadership in the family how important it is as fathers to have the right leadership in the family Acts chapter 5 we'll start reading with verse one very familiar scripture sorry bear with me one second Acts chapter 5 verse 1 but a certain man named ananas with saf his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet I just want to pause there as we've set sort of the the the basis for this story as we move forwards so this man has has come and and and done what he was supposed to do what everyone was doing this is what was commanded for the church in that day they were excuse me they were communing together as one they were in one mind and one Accord and we know many people have tried to replicate this feeling like maybe they can get some good works under their belts and you know God will bless them and he will to an extent but the human can't exist this way it's not intended to be this way it's supposed to be families living together but the reason they were doing this bringing their stuff was because they were instructed to in Acts chapter 4 and if you want to read the story later I would recommend it just for the backstory verse three of Acts chapter 5 but Peter said ananas why hath Satan filled nine filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land now remember he came and actually brought it he was doing what he was supposed to do but it wasn't that action it was what was in his heart part about it wasn't it verse four whils it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God and ananas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things now I just want to talk about this for a couple minutes maybe before we go further with this story now remember he was doing what was supposed to happen he was given the instruction they were given the instruction by the Holy Ghost and and they were following it but you know isn't it interesting that Peter would say to him why have you've chosen to let Satan fill your heart and and lie to the Holy Ghost because was he speaking to the Holy Ghost did he go to church and go on his knees and have a prayer closet meeting and pray unto the Holy Ghost no he was just talking to men wasn't he but the Apostle said no you lied to the Holy Ghost so isn't it interesting that you can be talking to people and actually who are you talking to brothers and sisters it's very important for us to recognize this as we go forwards very important I I just I can't get away from this thought how important it really is verse 5 and ananas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard heard these things and the young man arose and wound him up and carried him out and buried him it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yay for so much again then Peter said to her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up The Ghost and the young man came in found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things isn't it interesting brothers and sisters how they were talking to men some people might say brother Barry they were talking to Apostles so they're great men you know what I want to say is if you have the Holy Ghost in your life you're no different than those Apostles the only thing is they held an office that's all some people hold offices some people don't spiritually speaking but there's no greater office than to be the Bride of Jesus Christ is there because that's what the apostles were they were the Bride of Jesus Christ for their day and that's exactly who I would like to be addressing this morning and as we go forwards in 2024 the Bride of Jesus Christ recognize it brothers and sisters when you're speaking to your brother when you're speaking to your sister who are you speaking to we need to be careful brother Bram talks about it in 1965 1212 communion that's the trouble of us today I'll just let Isaac search that up that's the trouble of us today what I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe we're in the closing time do you believe you're in the closing time brothers and sisters we're in the closing of time we believe that God has give us a message it's been ordained of God it's been proven of God it's been showed of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with purity of heart and mind and soul because remember brothers and sisters when you're talking to your brother and your sister and they've got the Holy Ghost in their life they might not be Discerning your life but I promise you the Holy Ghost in them is and it's interesting because many times we can't understand the feelings that we're encountering the things that the emotions that are happening in our lives as we're conversing with folks but sometimes we'll just get funny feelings and we'll be like what's going on here you know what that is that's the Holy Ghost Discerning the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword brothers and sisters it's important that we live with purity of heart and mind and soul he says you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananas and saf remember see that hour is arriving see and we are now you just remember that see that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now 1965 how far down the road are we brothers and sisters how many years down the road is it how much farther are we along the road in terms of our Spiritual Development are we the same way that we would have been back there I just want to encourage us remember that we need to live with purity of Mind heart and soul and so when we talk about this as we go forwards I don't want to say that I'm not here preaching to us saying that you know the the hour is going to come that the holy spirit will speak out through us like ananas and Safa and and people will just be dropping dead in the service and they'll be carried out by the deacons and there'll be a truck taking people to the Undertaker that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about is eternal SE oparation spiritual death brothers and sisters that's what we're encountering in this world that we live in and that's what's so deceptive the devil is roaming like a a lion he's going to and fro seeking whom he may devour and if we don't have the token applied to our homes our families with proper Holy Ghost leadership that that that Lion's going to get in he's going to get in and he's going to ravage our families brother Bram says that it will be just like it did in an an annias and saf remember see that hour is arriving see remember brothers and sisters that hour is arriving paragraph 61 we can receive the message as saying if I was a young man and hunting for a wife and I could find a wife I said she's just perfect she's a Christian she's a lady she's all this I Got Confidence no matter how much confidence how much I think she's nice I've got to receive her she's got to receive me see upon these vows well it's the same thing we find is the message see I'm just saying see I I want to say it because brothers and sisters we have got to receive the message and you know the world around us we said it I think on Wednesday I'm going to say it again today the world around us they're going to say you're the same person that you were you're just a little bit funny you're into a cult or something and now you're all brainwashed what's going to happen is we know as Believers that we have the invisible Union of the bridegroom the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride of Jesus Christ but what needs to happen is the people around us who are the closest to us need to see that Union because if they're Believers they'll see that Union don't make that Union with the people who are the most close to us don't make it an invisible Union to them I say that I believe the message of the hour but I don't live it when I go home or when I go to work or when I go to school make it a visible Union amongst the Believers that's leadership brothers and sisters brother Bram says well it's the same thing we find is the message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right it's perfectly right year after year year after year it continues right continues right everything it says happens just exactly the way way he said now the trick of the devil is going to say well you know we laid hands on the sick and we prayed for them and they're still sick or we laid hands on the sick and we prayed for them and they died but you said this is God's will this is God's word this is God's way it's going to happen exactly the way that he wants it to happen brothers and sisters it's up to us just to get in line with his word and say Amen to his word and just say it's up to you Lord however you want it done that's how it'll happen happen he said now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you got a second-handed religion see we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else has experienced it and we are living off of their testimony now think about it brothers and sisters we can get into a situation where if we go back to our story this morning and just for for the the sake of maybe some I'll call it theatrical Liberty think about it now this brother he might have encountered someone in the church who actually was really money hungry and and and he might have thought that people were actually AIT a Scoundrels maybe he got burned really bad one time in a business deal with a a Believer maybe someone did something to his wife or someone close to him and he felt ripped off so he was going to do things from an inter ual standpoint and say of course we're going to come to church and and we're going to believe the prophet for our day and and we're going to give like they said to do but we're just going to hold back a little bit just a little bit that little conversation around the dinner table it it's only going to be for us and nobody else will know about it it'll be fine no one will ever know but you know what remember brothers and sisters be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever we sow that that shall we also reap so what we're doing with ourselves in our spare time we're planting seeds brothers and sisters and it's going to come to harvest we're not going to be able to hide it you know if we just live according to an intellectual standpoint we're going to say that the message of the hour is this or the message of the hour is that the message of the hour is Christ Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that same Jesus Christ that was there discerning hearts of the brothers and sisters in Peter's Day in ananas and saf's day is the same Holy Ghost that's right here in this building right now in the hearts of the Believers we got nowhere to hide why would we want to hide what do we have to hide is there anything to hide if there is brothers and sisters get it out get it out you don't have to hide nothing it'll just lead us astray and I just think it's it's it's the most scary thing ever because you know as as someone who might have a family it's not necessarily going to lead us astray because we're strong and Resolute in our constitution about whatever it is we believe if it's a second-handed religion and we know that that we've seen the message and we've heard it preached and and on and on and on but you know what it's not going to affect us the devil who's going around like a roaring lion he loves children that's his favorite diet the devil loves to get his hands on children and if we're not careful he will but isn't it wonderful testimony we heard about sister jarmain sister Amber sister Glend brother Cyrus dedicate your children unto the Lord claim them in the name of Jesus Christ and if you've done that Brothers and Sisters You've Done all you can take them train them up in the way they should go that's why we've got to train them the right way it's got to be according to the word for our day not some second-handed religion but if we train them up in the way they should go that word will not depart from them they might go Wayward into the world but eventually at the time appointed of the father he will put his hand on their shoulder and say it's time for you to get back to the altar you have got to go and actually make it right for you it's got to be your religion now it can't be your mom's religion it can't be your dad's religion it can't be anybody else's but your very own and when it happens brothers and sisters it's just it's just so beautiful there's nothing nothing like it but you know brothers and sisters when we get into talking about things with our mouths be not deceived God is Not mocked for who whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit of the spirit shall sorry he that Seth to the Spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting I love how it says that in verse 8 this is Galatians chap 6 verse 8 for he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption if we're looking at the hinder parts of people and we are sewing seeds with our mouth remember the spoken word is the Original Seed is it not true the words that we speak have power we were created to speak creation that's how we were created to have children but we know through the fall Eve being deceived God said okay you want it your way this is how it's going to happen you're going to have children through Labor through sorrow through pain through death that's how you will have children but it wasn't so from the beginning God intended full well for us to speak the word as Messiah s remember God was God Of Heaven man was god of Earth Man was created to be the god of the garden god of the Earth but he that Seth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption I just can't help but think about balum and baac we know that story very well that that that King he wanted to get God's Prophet to go and curse the children of Israel didn't he he had a totally a different agenda and and in doing so he couldn't go and curse what was blessed and he told the king that the prophet told them I can't God told me no I can't curse them but what did he do he worked on them he said let's look at their flesh let's look at their flesh let's talk about their flesh let's talk about the problems let's have those me Meal Time conversations let's go and gossip let's go and talk about these people and slander their names and eventually what's going to happen is you're going to blend with them and we know that God said that's the one thing that I won't do I will not accept that moving forwards God doesn't like it when we gossip brothers and sisters God hates it when we talk about our brother and our sister and so much so that I believe this with all my heart it is possible to blaspheme the Holy Ghost speaking about a brother or a sister now we're going to really dig into this as we go forwards but it's really important remember ananas and saf just take the money out of the equation it he didn't die because of money it wasn't about money it was about poor leadership someone had something in their mind in their heart and they said I can do it better than what the instruction of the word for my day is I can mingle my idea and it will be just fine the Holy Ghost came around to say uh-uh not this time buddy it ain't going to be just fine you follow exactly according to the word for your day or you bring death that's what that example is just like Moses in the land of goam the last plague apply the blood and if you don't apply the blood exactly like the instructions are what's going to happen the death Angel's passing through and if you don't have that token you know brothers and sisters the death angel is passing through the land today if we don't have that token followed the instruction exactly for the word for our day let's turn over to Matthew chapter 12 Matthew chapter 12 talking about leadership leadership in the body leadership in the family today I want to talk specifically about leadership in the family you know we can talk about the body in the church and the real leadership in the church is going to be the one that actually is willing to put the word of God first and not just preach it the same thing in the home we've got to be willing to live it in our home we could preach it all we want you know we brought up that picture that image maybe we'll bring that up too do you have that of the of the monkey the tinkling symbol we'll bring that up in a minute let's read this Matthew 12:31 Jesus speaking here he says wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him so remember Jesus God in flesh the fullness of the godhead made bodily is saying even to speak against Jesus the son of man it'll be forgiven it's okay right let's continue on but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit remember we talked about it last year I think it was last year maybe the year before it kind of Blends together I am the vine and who's the branches and every branch that puts forth fruit what's going to happen he's going to clip it and he's going to purge it but every branch that bringeth forth not fruit not fruit according to the word of God is going to be clipped off and thrown into the fire let let let the tree be good and his fruit good or else let the tree be corrupt and his fruit corrupt we know that in Revelation he said to the leodan church you know what you're you're neither War more cold and for that reason I'm just going to spit you out because you're you're neither good or bad you're nothing there's nothing going on for you I would that you were hot or cold at least there was something in you for the word it's important for us to recognize that when we're speaking and we're speaking specifically about brothers and sisters we need to make sure that we're letting that fruit be good that that tree that is actually doing the speaking the fruit of our lips brothers and sisters is good fruit because if it's not it's going to cause a major problem because we could potentially be blaspheming in the Holy Ghost and you know bring you can bring up that picture Isaac I put this up a while ago I'm going to keep bringing it up as we go if we just talk about the message of the hour and we act about the message of the hour this is what we are we're a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol if we have truly have the charity of the Holy Ghost the life literal love of Jesus Christ Living out through us we're going to live this message of the hour so not going to be something we're just preaching but until we actually begin to live it until it takes off in our lives this is what we are to the people around us you can take it down now we need to make sure that we know where we stand brothers and sisters we don't want to be that kind of a leader who wants to be that kind of a leader who wants to have that much of a blind spot everyone else can see that we're just tinkling the symbols talking about the message living about this and that but not actually showing the life of Jesus Christ in our lives by the fruit of our lips amen you know that Jesus he gave the disciples instruction and he told them to trry in Jerusalem and we know that we know that he was given for a purpose Jesus was given for a purpose and what was that so that he could atone for our sins he could be the sa sacrifice Made For All Mankind for the whole entire world and alls we have to do is accept it right we we don't have to do anything for it we just have to say amen and accept that sacrifice and and when he was done buried when he was put on the cross and and died he was buried and he resurrected again we know that he went back up to heaven and when he went up to heaven those two men were left standing there looking at the disciples as they watched him go up in the clouds and think wow and and they told him you know what ye men of Galilee what are you standing here looking for get big busy get moving get going get into Jerusalem and get together and wait until you are indued with power from on high and what was that that was Jesus Christ now going up to heaven and then dividing himself and sending that Pillar of Fire back upon men and we know that at Pentecost that's what happened but before Acts chapter 2 when the day of Pentecost was fully come we know that scripture very well before that could happen they had to have a little bit of a Shakedown Acts chapter 1 the latter part of it they had to get a little political they had to get all of the people into their positions and just the same with every single believer in order for us to get to that acts chapter 2 portion of Our Lives where the day of Pentecost is fully come for us in our lives we've got to do that in our lives we got to go back and make sure that we shake everything down pick out the details the devil's in the details brothers and sisters make sure that we're actually being led properly you know it's no accident that the message of the hour was recorded the way it was the very last message in the recordings of the message of the hour is communion the final ordinances that God has given that Jesus has given for the church in our day communion service but just before that the message was leadership and there's there's there's leadership for men were designed to be led brothers and sisters in the fall we were designed to be led and before that we still had a God and we love to worship him but we had the ability to to maybe lead ourselves as Messiah as God on this Earth but you know it's no accident that the message was recorded that way first leadership then communion if we cannot be led if we're not willing to be led brothers and sisters then I want to say this there's a pride spirit in us we're being affected by some kind of a spirit and I want to say it's Pride it's the devil and that's all it is let's just call it what it is if we've had a problem being led just call it out say I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ you don't have to be in a situation where you're you're you're knowing you're in a transgression if you truly believe the message of the hour then you're going to be fully willing to be led because if you're being led astray who's going to be responsible for that if you're living in purity of heart mind and soul I want to say this though I just think it's so beautiful if you are truly a son of daughter of God and you truly have the Holy Ghost in your life you can't be led astray it's that simple you don't have to live in fear we know that love casts out all fear perfect love casts out fear is what the word says so what do we have to fear brothers and sisters but fear itself Jesus gave them instruction to go back to Jerusalem and and then they had to get all of the humanity out that's what they had to do I said a little political they had to get all the humanity out they had to come to the place they were in one mind and one Accord they were no longer looking at the flesh they were no longer thinking that Peter had a temper and John was the most loved and someone else had this and something else was that they had to get all of that out of the way and once they did get past the humanity then God said okay now we're ready to do something and that's what I want to try and encourage us to brothers and sisters forget about the sin that so easily besets us and let's just with patience run this race together because one of these days someone's going to go in that resurrection and Rapture why not us they had to get all the humanity out of the way and they had to just like his bride she's got to get all the humanity out of her way because she's got Humanity he chose a bride who is a human being isn't that strange but she's going to take and say you know what all this flesh it doesn't matter it doesn't count for nothing because I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm not willing to let anybody get in my way I'm not willing to let anybody's hurt in the past get in my way I'm not willing to let any Pastor or someone else get in the way of my salvation in the way of my spiritual success it's not going to stop me and my family from going to church no way they had to stop with the politics and when they did they got the Holy Ghost one mind and one Accord you know brothers and sisters I want to just talk about this for a little while 1963 brother Bram he preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed you can bring it up Isaac I'm just going to take a minute or two and let you find it love one another above everything look that up love one another above everything in Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's called the word to the church commonly there's a poster of it in the back in the hallway there I just want to dwell on this for a little bit love one another above everything love one another there's no room for anger there's no room for hurt there's no room for resentment there's no room for fear there's no room for any other emotion than love brothers and sisters everything else will lead us astray we talked about it in in a a past service you know our senses are going to lie to us and as soon as we recognize that they're going contrary to the word of God that's when we have to say our senses no longer help us so we're just going to push them aside we're going to to leave our senses aside and we're going to go by faith we're going to go by the love that's within us am you can go ahead and bring it up love one another above everything love one another he says this is Brother Bram speaking Jesus God Elohim speaking through his Prophet to this age don't no matter what the devil tries to say how does the devil talk brothers and S sisters how does the devil speak how does God speak isn't it interesting no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in I like how he says that he'll bring some critics so a Believer will come in and sit down yeah a critic or an unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with with you under the quietness in things yeah we're Believers and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll what he'll start through the church with it how does he do that he'll start through the church with it he'll want to talk bad about a brother he'll want to lamb a sister he'll say do you know what that Pastor did oh do you know what that Deacon did do you know what the song leader does all these different things and it's all based on a past experiences in our lives that's why we're going to be magnetically drawn to those faults but if we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters it puts us in a different spot he says he'll cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it what is the Prophet say what does God say through the prophet to the church he says don't you take sides with it that's the believer's position I'm going to just shout that tonight that's where the believer is actually going to live the make believer and the unbeliever they're going to be fellowshipping back and forth from cup to cup they're going to be going this way and you know what there's three kinds of Believers in every Group which one are you don't you have nothing to do with anything else amen you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another Hallelujah pray for that man that he'll be Sav too or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and stick with one another and you know I'm not saying this about me but it's here so I'm going to say it it says and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and I just say this if you can't respect the man look at the office and you give him respects give the office respects brothers and sisters because that office he'll lead you through and because he's ordained of God to do so brother bradam goes on to say here God through the prophet now do you remember that congregation says amen the enemy will come brothers and sisters this isn't just a fictitious statement from a prophet that that that was written up and put in a book and someone put on a poster this is about the life of Jesus Christ This is is about the Church of the Living God the devil is going to come in and sit down in our group he's going to try and shoot poison stuff through our church he's going to try and get us to slander one another but just stay right sweet and pray for that brother or that sister don't slander them back we don't want to do that and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out because they can't stand the preaching of the Holy Ghost and they can't stand it when the someone else has that shut your mouth Ministry and when they start talking oh so gently and sweet about that brother and you know he does this they'll say shut your mouth I don't want nothing to do with that because I recognize that's Satan and I rebuke you in the name of Jesus what must that have been like hey for that Apostle they were having Church having such a a good time together Jesus said I've got to be delivered up I I've got to go and be delivered up so that I can die for the sins of man I'm going to go and get nailed to a cross and and they're going to do that to me and what did Peter say he said no not on my watch I'm going to show you my sword I'm going to go and I'm going to do in anyone that wants to get in the way I'm your bodyguard see you're my guy and I got you I got this intellectual thinking right and what did Jesus do he didn't say Peter don't you know know the scriptures I've got to be you know delivered up into sinful men and and and be killed and and buried and then raised again the third day and no he didn't he said Satan get behind me because you don't understand man I am God in flesh and my will is going to come to pass the devil loves to go to church it's just a fact but you know brothers and sisters that person whoever the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all isn't that beautiful he says don't never Clan among one or talk make yourself clannish he says we are one I couldn't say my left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand and I I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I can tell you brothers and sisters even the little little tip of my finger I want it to stay right there and last night I almost took it off I want the little tip of my finger and and just like any one of us in the church we might not have a lot that we do in the church but brothers and sisters when you come here you might not notice what you do but the others do you bring an atmosphere and you know what if you're just a little tip of the finger in the body keep coming we need you he says he's my left hand I want him to stay right there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another amen hallelujah this is the word to the church brothers and sisters we need to be very careful because as Leaders of our homes what we say it means something every word that we speak has power and you know the natural world is typing into this is is really dialing into it the spoken word and you know we've talked about videos in the past and and we all have probably heard this but I'm just going to throw it out there as we go into 24 you know they they've said that videos are the rage and that's why in every restaurant and every place you go into it's all video screens and you know even in Philippines you don't see it so much here but when we were there there was giant Billboards that were video screen screens huge why is it because it captures our attention but you know that's not really what the endgame is the end game for technology is the spoken word and you know if you want to test it when we leave service here I should say it from the microphone I'm not going to because I wouldn't want to put anybody on the spot I'll just turn this off and uh and I'll say it if if you want to see really who's listening just say hey Siri and see whose phone answers because she's always listening he's always listening whatever it is is always listening brothers and sisters the spoken word is the age that we live in and that's why we need to recognize the power of our words remember Elisha the prophet and how he followed his teacher he followed the word to a letter for his day he said to him you know if you follow me and you don't take your eyes off of me if you keep yourself focused with this word you can have what you ask and he said hey I want a double portion of what you got then and we know that's what he got but in between the time that that his master went up on a chariot of fire and he performed all the double Miracles that he asked for that double portion we know that he went across he had his his master's mantle he had that anointing was upon him and what happened there was all those children that were out playing and what did the children do the children were mocking the prophet of God in his day we know it was the devil in those children because the parents didn't recognize enough that there is power in their words and what happened what whatsoever they had sown they shall reap because God's not mocked and what were they doing they weren't mocking the prophet of God they were mocking God and they didn't even recognize it and that's why I want to say brothers and sisters make sure that we are not mocking God because if God is working through a brother or a sister and we mock him boy oh boy oh boy and you know what in the day in which we live don't worry about she Bears coming out of the woods worry about rock and roll coming out of the woods worry about the pressures of this life coming out of the woods worry about Hollywood coming out of the woods worry about all the attraction all the shiny things in this world coming out of the woods to capture the attention of our children because that's what we encounter that's what we're fighting against we don't have to worry about she bears not even seeing an enemy come in with rifles one day that could happen here brother bradam talked about it in places I'm sure but we've got this world oh see look at this my sorry my phone was listening what we say means something brothers and sisters and that's why that is why the world is dialing into this it's not about videos it's not about deep fake even it's about the power of the spoken word because our body hears it and we know we probably heard this said that every single cell in our body hears the power of our spoken word and the entire business world out there the athletes all of that understand the psychology behind it what it does is it changes our thinking and we might not feel a change but our feelings have nothing to do with it we will never live above our confession so speak High brothers and sisters testify about the things of the Lord recognize our position in Christ Jesus as we go through 2024 what we say it means something and you know when we say something isn't it amazing I was thinking about this when we say something we can become known by our word and you know we do become known by our word for sure either for keeping our word or for breaking our word we are known by our word the word that's spoken our vow we are known by it and our lives our actions display this we don't even need to speak I could say one thing to my wife and then do something totally different and she might not say anything to me she might just be completely silent about it and I might think everything is just fine there's no problem there's no issue we'll just carry on everything will be fine but eventually one day after that happens over and over and over again one of these days she's going to snap something's going to give and there's going to be a big huge problem that goes on why is that because I'm not keeping my word I'm saying that I'm a Believer but maybe I'm not acting like one or maybe I'm actually saying that I'm a believer and then I'm acting like one either way we become known by our words and you know the most important thing is for our children to see that our children our spouses our friends our family what I wanted to talk about today brothers and sisters is that blasphemy it isn't simply saying that I believe that I don't believe sorry that God sent a prophet because many times we could look at it and say well you know blaspheming is is saying that I don't believe the works of God that that it's the works of the devil and you know the prophet of God he was not the prophet of God he was maybe a charlatan like some people would try and paint him you know to maybe say that I don't believe the way that that Minister preaches or whatever it is all of that you know blaspheming in our day is going to be seeing the Holy Ghost operating in someone's life whether we discern it or not and then speaking evil of it brothers and sisters that's blaspheming right amen saying amen are not to the word that's not blaspheming I had a discussion with a young man about this and he felt like he blasphemed like he overstepped but you know he didn't because we said it before and we'll say it again if your soul is a a a son and daughter of God you can't make a deal with the devil for your soul you can't blaspheme away your day you you you're saved to the day of your Redemption but you know blaspheming can't be done by a Christian isn't that a beautiful thing and I got a quote for that one that I'm going to bring I'm going to make sure that we have that but I want to say Lord have mercy in our lives that that that we would not blaspheme the holy ghost that we would look at our brothers and look at our sisters as we read that quote that we have in the back this morning that we would say you know what I don't know what's going on that brother that sister's life but I know that God will deal with them accordingly and I want to say that they are a son and a daughter of God and blessed be the name of the Lord because he saved me I recognize myself to be a skunk and outside of the grace of God in my life I would be nothing amen the message of the hour isn't just so we can have knowledge it's so that we can have life and brothers and sisters it's not just so that we can have eternal life many times we can put it out there and say yeah praise the Lord I I know the message of the hour I got the message of the hour and I I know that I've got the message of the hour because I believe it and I can say Amen to it but for some reason we just can't live it do you have it do you have the message of the hour if we're not living it according to the way the prophet said for our day I'll say no we don't but it's not too late that's the point in 2024 we can get in line with the word for our day and we can see this life it's not about just eternal life it's about living the life of Jesus Christ today to the world around us Christ in you the hope of glory let's turn to Matthew Chapter 5 quickly as we've got five minutes left Matthew Chapter 5 in [Music] five talking about blaspheming talking about our words having power talking about leadership correct leadership in our homes we need to teach our wives nope don't talk that way we need to teach our children nope don't say that about your brother or your sister that's potentially God living out through them Matthew chap 5:22 Sermon on the Mount Jesus speaking here he says but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hellfire therefore if thou bring thy gift to The Altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother then come and offer thy gift he gives us very clear instructions on how to deal with this and when we come to church brothers and sisters is the altar when we go on our knees brothers and sisters is the altar we have an opportunity for God to speak to us and if you are a son and daughter of God you know exactly what I'm saying to you right now he will speak to your heart and when he does speak to your heart you have the opportunity now to apply this scripture right here but if you choose to step over it and say well you know this that the other whatever the thing is then what happens is you're in danger you're in danger and we know that brother brandham says it very clearly that our souls are hung over Hell by a chain and a chain is as strong as its weakest link don't let our pride be that weak Link in our lives humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will lift you up and remember humbling yourself in the sight of the Lord isn't just coming to prayer meeting it's not just coming to church it's not just having prayer it's humbling yourself before your brother before your sister before your husband before your wife before your parents before your children having the ability to show that you have humility the life of Jesus Christ Living in you Hebrews chapter 6 number two as we close this morning I'll even call the musicians to prove it paragraph 313 brother bradam says some woman come to me not long ago some woman come to me not long ago I'll just give you the opportunity to look that up this is that quote I was talking about some woman come to me not long ago I I don't want to ever leave us in a situation where we think my goodness am I in danger of Hellfire I know I've said something about that brother and I've said something about that sister you know if you have just put it under the blood how do you do that just go and tell them say I said that about you I hope you'll forgive me and you know we've probably heard it said and I I would ask if anyone knows the quote specifically or I don't know if it's just a tradition go ahead bring it up um we wouldn't want to be guilty of taking something that's been thoroughly properly placed under the blood and pulling it out from under the blood to wave it in front of someone would we I've heard it said that that actually could potentially become our very own if we're willing to do that I don't know the quote if someone has it I'd love it if you could send it to me but brothers and sisters if something's under the blood leave it there because which one of us is without sin you know the one without sin go ahead and cast the first stone that's what Jesus said to the woman who was caught in the act that's right why brother bradam says some woman and come to me not long ago and said brother brandom I'm a Christian but I blasphemed the Holy Ghost I love it God speaking through his Prophet I said it's impossible a Christian could not blaspheme the Holy Ghost you can't do it a Christian Spirit Bears record with Christ's Spirit see and you'll call everything of God Gods I want to say this brothers and sisters if you have done something and you are a Christian you're not going to just leave it there it's going to haunt you every single waking hour God will not let you rest it will haunt you it will haunt you until you go make it right and as a son and daughter of God you will go and make it right brother bradam says I said it's impossible a Christian could not blaspheme the Holy Ghost you can't do it a Christian Spirit Bears record with Christ Spirit see and you'll call everything of God Gods but if your car Al minded you'll make fun and laugh at the Holy Ghost I don't care how much you go to church you're still a sinner and you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost remember the same thing as we talked about in our scripture today they're not talking about he's not talking about speaking to Jesus in prayer and and saying that whatever is happening is is the the the the life of the devil that's not what he's talking about it's the life of the brothers and sisters ERS right if you're carnal minded and you're looking at the hinder Parts you'll make fun and laugh at the Holy Ghost you're still a sinner and you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost when they seen Jesus Discerning their thoughts they said he was a fortune teller Jesus said I'll forgive you for that but when the Holy Ghost has come you speak a word against it it'll never be forgiven you because they said he has an unclean Spirit calling the spirit of God an unclean thing a Christian can't do that a Christian will always call the spirit of God righteousness see a Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's the outsider that blaspheme I just want to be clear brothers and sisters we can say things about a brother and a sister we can say things about family members but we can go and make it right and which one of us here which one of us here has never said something about someone I'm saying it now put up a hand whoever hasn't said anything about anybody in your life ever behind their back put a hand up I I can't do it either right we're all Sinners saved by grace aren't we isn't it the same Grace that we're all living off of if you have and it is bothering you you can go and make it right and I promise you brothers and sisters God will reward you abundantly for it and it might not come the way that you think it will it might just save your children it might prevent sickness from overcoming a child or overcoming a spouse it might prevent who knows what from happening in your life God he he wants to bless us a thousand more times that we want to be blessed this ain't about money about tithing and going to church this is about having the literal life of Jesus Christ Living out through his bride body he says that wasn't Christian step standing there it was religious people I hope there's no religious people here today it was Orthodox Jews doctors of divinity and so forth and they were making fun of him and calling his Works calling the works of God that it was an unclean Spirit doing it maybe stand with me as we finish this out here and how many do you think today blasphemes the Holy Ghost that's got a DDD PhD on their name how many great stiff necks orthodox Catholics Protestants walk the street and make fun of the operation of the Holy Ghost now I'm going to just whisper this in there brothers and sisters but how many stiff necks stiff necked I'll call it message people walk the street and make fun of the operation of the Holy Ghost just as polish Scholars I've been in the message for decades where'd you come from and slick as a button brother bam says right but they make fun of the Holy Ghost and therefore they blast blashe it but a born- again Christian cannot do that he'll say that's my brother oh my that's my that's the spirit of the Living God that's right a Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's the sinner that blasphemes the Holy Ghost the unbeliever The Sinner and unbeliever there's only two things either you are a Believer or you are an unbeliever and I believe we're talking to Believers here this morning but if there's anyone here that doesn't know where they stand take a look at it it's not too late get in the boat brothers and sisters it's going to rain fire one of these days let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we love you and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord we recognize that the devil he doesn't play fair oh father and many times we can live our lives and we can be be stuck in a constitution of of thinking in our lives Lord and we know that you still bless us because we tithe you

Lord father that it wouldn't just be lip service Lord Jesus but that it would be a life lived and father we know that as we go forwards today we can take another step we don't have to stay the same way that we were when we came in this building father that our families can say they've seen a change Lord help us to change help us not be willing to oh Father just be complacent about this message
