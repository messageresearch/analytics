we just ask that you would just be glorified now and all that said and done Lord Jesus bless our service today sovereignly we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians you have your Bibles today I'd like to take a little bit of a different Direction Maybe maybe uh familiar one to some story second Corinthians chapter three if you don't mind turning there second Corinthians chapter 3 start reading with verse 6. who also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the administration of condemnation be glory much more doth administration of righteousness exceed in glory or even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excellith or if that which is done away was glorious much more that which with that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful for the promise Lord Lord we know that the children of Israel were blinded for our sakes Lord Jesus and father what an amazing promise it is to know that we are being changed from glory to glory father we came from you Lord Jesus and we are going back to you father we're so thankful for your word we pray that you would Quicken it father with your spirit to our very Souls today Lord that when we leave this building we would say truly that our hearts burned within us because you spoke to us along the way father I pray that I would be able to step aside and just give you the preeminence Lord that you would speak to us today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements we wanted to mention we have the trustees meeting coming up this week um we have Jim Knight coming up as well on Friday we will certainly text out some details we did to the youth but we'll text it out to everyone so we have all of the particulars uh for Friday night it will be a fun time so if you want to get together and just have a little bit of fun maybe sweat a little bit it's a it's a good time um so 24th we'll have gym night on the 26th next Sunday we're actually going to have brother Tony oh gerbesa take the service it'll truly be a privilege to have him take the service and then in the evening we'll have a communion foot washing as per the schedule just wanted to mention the annual men's meeting we have moved it from the 28th which we had scheduled originally to the 27th we had some scheduling conflicts so we had to move it we really didn't have a choice so if you'll just bear with us if anybody has an issue with that maybe come and see me um I don't know how we can really get around it though but that's the way it is so Lord willing will aim for Monday the 27th for that meeting it would be the same time in the same place we'll meet at the church be happy this morning scripture that we read this morning second Corinthians chapter 3 we have Paul writing a letter to the Corinthians we know full well and uh it's such a an interesting thought speaking about how the the children of Israel they reverenced the stones that that Moses brought down off the mountain they reverenced the law we know that it was the Ten Commandments it was the the direction that God gave Moses when he went up onto the holy mount and that was the time where the children of Israel said you know don't let God speak lest we die speak to us through a man and we know that that's where prophets came into the into the scene onto the stage for God's Great drama and brother Branham talks about it as uh changing of a mask and he talks about how God used people throughout the ages and so some of you might understand where I'm going with this today if you don't I just want to mention that I'm going to be ministering directly from the Mighty God unveiled in 1964. brother Branham talks about some really significant things in there that I think is worth mentioning and I just felt led to go this way and you know we had talked about how we we need to have a perfect realization brother Branham in the Philadelphia Church age he said this we've read this quote a few times and I just think it's so so vital for us in the day in which we live and maybe we're preaching to the choir but maybe some people just haven't really understood what I meant by this it can sound a little bit complicated and maybe I'll just read it slow and we'll just go through it again here he says these things saith he that is true and we know that's the spirit the spirit giveth life we read that already in the scripture here this is Jesus Christ the the white wigged one in the beginning of the book of Revelation that we have have all read he says these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it's the opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven John 15 1 I am the True Vine we have spent some time on that one he's not just the vine but he is the true vine the only Vine now we know brother Branham talked about that if that vine ever puts forth another Branch if that tree ever puts forth another Branch it will be the same as the original and really the end of the sermon today is very much that that branch is putting forth today and what that Branch actually is is Christ it's not us plus Christ it's not Christ plus us it's not an association it's not a church it's God himself in flesh brother Bradham says it in the in the in the church age book unless we get that Revelation the Revelation that Jesus Christ is God the fullness of the godhead bodily then we're lost Jesus Christ was God all God he wasn't part God and to try and say that he was only God at this specific point and and a little bit of God at that specific point brothers and sisters don't get caught up in semantics don't worry about that the devil is in the details but the spirit of God giveth life he says for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven John 15 1 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9 24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places which are which made our holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us John 2 8 because the darkness has passed and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance with Shadow I believe that that speaks directly to the scripture that we read this morning out of second Corinthians the law being a shadow of the grace that was coming through Jesus Christ this was is a shadow and a type of this grace that we have been given today in our lives you know we talked about this in the past as well last service I think it was all that God was he poured into the church into Christ sorry out of the marriage of the Lamb 1962 he says you can be an artificial professed Christian but you can't be be a Christian until Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you that's the new birth brothers and sisters the new birth isn't saying I just accept that Jesus Christ died and and rose again I believe that he rose again from the dead and now I'm saved and it's all good it's not that that's not what it is we have to get the baptism of the Holy Spirit and what that is is coming completely subject to the word of God for our day we can have the word of God for another day but that won't get us the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters we could say let's build a boat like Noah did and and everybody get together and pull our resources and build a boat build a ship build a great ship in fact I think they've done it in Kentucky to do a a replica of it but that boat down there isn't going to save them and if we all clamored to get on it it's not going to save us because the baptism of the earth that's going to happen now according to the prophet for our day the word for our day is going to be a baptism of fire and that boat's gonna burn it's not going to float the only way that we're going to be able to pitch ourselves according to the way Noah did it is with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's the only thing and I know Paul talks about it that all men's work will will be revealed whether it's of wood whether it's of straw but if it's of the elements the even the elements are going to melt with a fervent heat but they will become as pure as they ever could be only his life will live he says Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then you're connected with him and you're not you're no longer Twain You're not too according to Ephesians chapter five we've talked about this so many times on Wednesday I think that it might be getting tiring to some extent but Paul says at the end of that chapter he's not talking about a husband and a wife he's actually talking about the mystery of Christ in his bride Christ and his bride becoming one which is exactly what we're talking about here Christ promised to be in us as the father was in Christ can you believe that that's pretty hard to believe and the reason that for that is because we deal with our feelings we're in a a body that that contends with feelings and emotions and affections we have the five outer senses and we have the five inner senses and that's really where we live but we've got to go beyond that we've got to go right into the the innermost part of ourselves which is our soul that that little tiny space that God created for himself and sometimes that can be the hardest place to get into because we've got so many other things in the way on all of those 10 outer senses they can keep us from being able to get in there brother Brown preaches that message doors indoor and and that very much speaks to that sometimes there's one place where we've got so much hurt so much problem so much issue that we close that door and we just build brick wall in front of it and we fortify it and nobody is ever going to get that door open again we just don't ever want to feel that hurt again but sometimes we have to sometimes we've got to in fact I would say if there is something like that in your life you're not going to be able to get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost until you open that door because he doesn't want to have a partial residence he doesn't want to live in just part of the house he wants the whole house the whole entire Tabernacle is his but he says then you're no longer Twain You're one Christ promised to be in us as the father was in Christ I and my father are one you and I are one see Christ in us and truly brothers and sisters have we've been baptized with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then then we're one we're one today we're not many many different people all together with many different personalities even though we are but we need to go beyond that and look at one another and say hey I see Jesus Christ I'm not willing to look at the badger skin and say I don't like the way that Brother Talks to me and I don't like the way that sister doesn't talk to me and and I don't think that this is right or that's right with our brother or sister if we're doing that then we're just doing Satan a favor and we're just actually giving him a day off but if we can look beyond that and actually say you know what I think my sister might have said something or my brother might have said something but I know they didn't mean it because that wasn't truly the spirit of God and I believe their son and daughter of God I believe that they're saved remember we talked about in the past we're living in the third pole condition one day we're going to speak squirrels into existence Maybe or maybe we'll be so thirsty we'll need a drink of water and and and maybe our children will need a drink of water who knows what will happen what the world has in store for us many different theories and ideas have come out in conversation about what that third third pole manifestation will be like we know brother Bradham says in places that limbs missing limbs will be restored can you imagine that that's not going to be a prophet of God doing it that's going to be God doing it that's going to be God doing it but where is he going to be doing it it's going to be doing it in you it's going to be doing it to me he's going to be doing it us we live in the third pole condition but how's he going to do it he's going to do it by the spoken word right how much more detrimental is that spoken word if we start talking negative if we start giving voice to the enemy anything negative is of the Enemy by the way any negative is of the enemy not just a part of it not just or we could say well it's truth it's truth so it makes it okay to say it does it just because it's truth I don't know I believe that we have the ability to actually remit sin don't we isn't that what the word of God says who's ever a sin you remit shall be remitted we have the ability to do that but the battle goes on to say here all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church for a reason and that reason is to continue the work of the Gospel then we become not by artificial name not by an associate church member I'm a part of this denomination no Brother Brad Thomas says then we become not by artificial name but by a reality of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are raised from the dead things of the world and setting with him in Heavenly places and that's where we need to soar brothers and sisters we need to go to that place where we recognize that it doesn't matter what we feel like it doesn't matter what we're going through we're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's why brother Barry just continually harps on getting the Holy Ghost we've got to know that we have the Holy Ghost in our lives and if we do I believe we should be able to just say Amen you know brother Bradham talks about that old lady that had had said to him he was talking having fellowship with her whatever and he said to her you know how long have you had the Holy Ghost sister and she says praise God I remember it's been however many years we should be able to have that kind of conversation without it being awkward or weird as Believers we have nothing more to celebrate in our lives than the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it should be something to Rejoice about don't let Satan hang a weapon on you and say no you don't got it no you don't know if you got it say I got it brother Bradham said you you'll never live below your Confederate above your confession if you say you don't know whether you've got it you're given Satan a day off say you got it I believe it it's mine it's my promise we want to have healing in our lives brother Bradham says it you got to say I'm Healed I believe I've got my healing we have to have that confession in our lives and if we don't have that confession what's going to happen great I think this is just beautiful it's just like a bucket of Honey brother bottom talks about that story about the Bears Ram wrecking his tent getting in there and tearing it up you know some people will say well brother Brad him in one place he said that it was a bucket of honey and another place he said it was a bucket of molasses who cares what it was it was sweet and it was the word of God he was referring to and that's what we want to do brothers and sisters is push aside all the humanity and just get right into the holy of holies today I think I just love it when the Lord comes around and actually confirms the direction of a sermon by the songs that are sung the songs that we sang today dovetail with what we're talking about today you know there's there's there was a time where man had the ability to walk in the cool of the garden with with God Adam was able to just spend time with God and and and and and just fellowship with him but something happened we know the fall took place the woman was deceived the man wasn't the man stepped out why did the man step up because if he didn't step out his wife would have been lost so he stepped out to redeem his bride that's the reason Adam fell it wasn't to just go and fall he did it with intent within purpose in mind just like Jesus Christ stepped out to actually redeem his bride but man has had a desire since then to speak to God he's always desired to speak to God and you know in Genesis 4 it took until Genesis 4 for this to take place the end of this chapter Genesis 4 25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said she hath appointed me she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom came slow and to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos and be and then began men to call on the name of the Lord I just found this interesting when we look at it there was a desire for men to speak to God but there seemed to be a bit of a lapse in time from when Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden to the time they actually had the desire to speak to God again think about the condemnation that there must have been what it must have been like to no longer be able to fellowship with the Lord to just have the the complete everything just shut off I just I think it's amazing to think about but you know once upon a time it was death to actually go back to that tree of life wasn't it God put the swords the flaming swords in the hands of the Angels at the Garden of Eden blocking it from all access to mankind but now we know today to not go back to that tree of life that has been completely exposed and open to us and the invitation has been written we've been given a written invitation by the way haven't we from Jeffersonville Indiana we've been given the message of the hour and books and tapes it's a written invitation to that tree of life brothers and sisters whether we see it or not it truly is the word of God in print form the Bible is is a is a written invitation to come right back to that tree of life we know job he was one who had a desire to speak to God Brother Brad him in this message he talks about how job desired to speak to God but God did not come down and actually speak to him face to face God came in a whirlwind and we know that the brother Brown talks about the South Africans they call it a Moya and and it's an unseen force that word expresses that there's an unseen force and God was unseen you could see the the Whirlwind but you couldn't see God we know in our day brother Bradham when he was young he saw that tree and and that tree the leaves were were rattling and that voice and the Whirlwind and that tree spoke to him directly God evales himself there was a time where people didn't want to hear from God we talked about that and and and and and just thinking about how incredible it is how far things drifted from the perfection in the Garden of Eden so far that the voice of God do you think the voice of God changed from the Garden of Eden to to the voice of God that spoke to the children of Israel did that voice change I don't know I'm not saying that it did or it didn't but I can only imagine because he the word of God says that he's the same yesterday today and forever I can only imagine that it was the same voice but for some reason they didn't want to hear his voice they only wanted something different they wanted a substitute for it so God said okay I'll give you a substitute but you're still going to hear my voice you're not going to have excuse on that day to say you didn't hear my voice you didn't hear the truth for your day so he gave him a prophet he raised up a prophet for them to actually hear his voice that's Exodus 20 verse 18 and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and we know that that scripture God granted it he said okay that's fine that's what you want that's what we'll do and and so he did just like the children of Israel they got into their promised land and they started to look around and and everything was fine fine all their needs were met everything was good but they wanted to be like the Joneses didn't they they wanted to be like the other other nations surrounding them they wanted to have a king with skin on they they didn't like the idea of there just being a prophet in the land and you know that's really I think in my opinion I don't know I could be wrong but I think that's really where prophets started to fade off the scene where people didn't really want to deal with prophets anymore because the only thing that prophets did was bring them condemnation and judgment the prophets they always spoke mean against the people especially the Kings they weren't afraid to go and put their finger right in their nose and say it's not lawful for you to do that but you know after some time after some time Moses he went up on the mountain something happened to him the people said send them up go ahead talk to him don't talk to us nope your voice scares us we're gonna die and and why is that because they knew they weren't right with God they had condemnation in their hearts there was something wrong with them they didn't have that relationship with God so they didn't want to hear his voice and it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters when we have condemnation in our lives we just don't want to hear his voice we just don't want to go to church we just don't want to press play we just don't want to pick up our Bible we just don't want to go on our knees and pray it's condemnation in our lives but you know what we have more than a conqueror on our side we have the ability to cut through that and you know the moment that we do cut through that the moment that we cry out to God he's right there waiting for us and he's right there willing to receive us and all we need to do is just give one second of effort into it and all of those spirits that are trying to afflict us through condemnation and all the things that we've lived through all of them are defeated all of them have to step back in the name of Jesus you speak the name of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ say those words when you're going through condemnation and Watch What Happens that Veil that's blocking you it will actually separate it will move out of the way you won't be blocked from getting getting attention of God being able to talk to him but you know for some time Moses face glowed when he came down off the mountain didn't it you know Exodus 34 28 and he was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights he didn't either eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables of the words of the Covenant the Ten Commandments this is the law that we're reading about here being a foreshadow and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony or stone I'll say in Moses hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wished not that the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him and we know that Moses actually had to put a veil over his face and why did he have to do that because of the glory of God spending that time in the presence of the Lord caused him to radiate and brothers and sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that wasn't just someone different up there on the mount that was God himself and and the same one when we get in his presence you cannot help but radiate that same radiation that same Pillar of Fire that really the world wants you to fail the world can't stand it when you get around them and you start to radiate that Pillar of Fire that light they they scramble they don't like it it causes conflict many times but other times people can respect it people can say wow there's something different about you and I like it I really like it something happens when you're around or maybe they'll come to your house and they'll say there's just something special about the presence in your house why is it like that and you can give them an opportunity you can give them a reason for that testimony well I can I can tell you why if you want to hear it but it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's beautiful when we look at it this is out of the Mighty God unveiled this is the inspiration for this the the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled he preaches a few different sermons in in in that space of time and and they're just tremendous but uh you know Moses he was different than the rest of the children of Israel wasn't he the rest of the children of Israel they said oh my don't let God speak unless we die let somebody else speak to us and Moses he had a desire for God to speak to him he wanted to hear from God he wanted to have that relationship with God and and so much so that as the relationship developed where it became that amoya for him to deal with he he wanted to desire he desired to see his face he got to that place where I don't want to just talk to you on the phone anymore I I don't want to just talk to an unseen face and have this this untangible conversation I want to see him will you show me your countenance he asked him that and God said to him you know what just stand on this rock and when I pass by you'll see my glory but you won't see my face because that's not for you Moses that's for a different group of people to see my face it's not for you we know it's the same thing for Daniel Daniel desired to see all of those things that were told he was told to seal up he wanted to look upon it he wanted to study it because Daniel was was a study or Daniel was smart Daniel understood where he stood by the reading of the books he under understood that 70 years would come to pass and when that time came he'd be able to go back home they'd be able to go back and rebuild Moses he desired to see God he had this desire in his heart Exodus 33 21 and the Lord said behold there is a place by me isn't that wonderful to think there is a place by me and and he said and thou shalt stand upon a rock not just any Rock Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen just such a beautiful thought there's so much in there I believe we could take a whole entire service right there maybe sometime we will but to think that the Lord said you know you're you you want to see me you want to have that relationship the only way that you're going to have that relationship is to hear my word and my word says that I'm going to put you up upon a rock and that rock is a rock of Revelation because you believe my voice you believe my word I'm going to put you on that rock Moses and you're going to stand there and you're going to see me you'll see the part of me that I have ordained for you to see what a tremendous thought that is today living in the in the in the shadow I'll call it of the message of the hour but in the sunshine the s-o-n shine of the rising of the sun it's truly a magnificent thing because we're not shown we're not given the direction to see the back part of God we're actually given the direction to see him face to face in our day brother Branham out of the Mighty God unveiled he says and while standing on the Rock Moses seen him pass and he saw the back of him and he said it looked like a man a man's back yet he did not see God he only seen the veil of God it's a tremendous thought God gave him the opportunity to see him but he still wouldn't let him see him he would just only let him see the back part and remember we're talking about the seventh angel messenger the the the the prophet for our day the the one who brought the word to us the Ellie easer the Elijah for our day and and what does he preach here he's preaching the Mighty God unveiled Moses the one who who was friends with God God called him a friend he wasn't able to actually see him there's a word that brother Branham uses here in 1964. and he doesn't say it before it and he only says it after it and that is in morphe he speaks it 19 times in the message of the hour and morphe he says in Dr Schofield here we find that his word changing from form we find the work and the word Amore in Greek which means the Unseen was made visible something that cannot we know it's not we know it's there it can be cannot be seen but yet we know that it's there and when he changed his form of the en morphe which mean that he changed from Supernatural to Natural he went from the supernatural being to a natural being we know that the word of God says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word is God not some other person he goes on to say and he just changed his mask and otherwise it's like a drama he was acting and in the Greek when they would change their mask maybe one plague One play player may have acted in several different parts and and he goes on to talk about this in in this message it's it's such a beautiful thought but you know God has chosen many different veils over the ages many different veils and what is it according to the prophet of God it's God and morphe he's just changing his mask he's going from one to the other all that God was Elohim the self-existing one but he went from that to being God on object of worship all that God was in that mask he poured in behind another mask Jesus Christ right and it didn't change who he was he was the same person one person one being the same person poured into Christ but then he goes on to say that all that Christ was God Elohim poured into the church it's a tremendous thought brothers and sisters to think that he's poured all of himself out into the church so where is he today everyone's hands should go up right now he's right here God in flesh if we believe what the prophet of God said and I think it's you know it can sometimes seem like maybe it's a bit crazy almost like a heretic talking like this but I I just believe there's a a direction for it and there's a purpose for it brothers and sisters we'll read the quote I've got it today but you know when the church recognizes its position then the Rapture will go who wants to stay here one minute sooner I believe there's one message for us and that's to get into Christ because if we can get into Christ we'll recognize our position that's just my thought I just believe that with all my heart if we can truly get into Christ and get beyond all of the outer Veil all the badger skin stuff that we deal with on a day-to-day basis if we can get beyond all of that the Rapture is going to go you know in the wilderness God gave Moses instruction gave the children of Israel instruction through Moses I just love it we can see it all the way through the Bible God speaks to the people but through the man he doesn't boom his voice out and scare everyone it doesn't want to alarm everyone he wants to be a gentleman and say you know I I know that scares you so we'll just I'll just give you a prophet I'll just raise up a man then you know what he'll speak to you and it's up to you to decide whether it's actually according to the word or not you're going to have to do the research you're going to have to have the right Spirit to be able to receive that word for your day but in the Tabernacle in the wilderness Exodus 25 verse 8 he says and and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them he wanted to give them a veil he wanted to give them a mask he wanted to give them something tangible that they could actually say that's where God is when God comes down that pillar of cloud or that Pillar of Fire that's where he's at and it's no different for us today God is not in this building we bring God to this building this is not the place that he dwells when that Pillar of Fire comes down when that when that pillar of cloud happens it's because we bring it here to this building and we we bring him here then he's here and you know where the the word of God says where two or three gathered together in his name he's there so he's here right now brothers and sisters he is here with us right now Exodus 25 8 and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it and we know we talked about this in the past we even had the picture on the overhead here how there was the outer Court there was the inner court and then there was the holy of holies and he actually instructed Moses to build this out of badger skins the veil for the holy of holies was built out of badger skins on a very deliberate purpose it wasn't just by accident it wasn't because there was an abundance of badgers all over the land it was to represent something and brother Bradham says the reason he chose Badger skins is because it's an honorary little creature a badger represents Humanity human beings outside of the Holy Ghost our brute Beast is what the prophet of God said without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're brute beasts we're created in in the in the hybrid condition from the Garden of Eden and think about how much Purity there is in our lives I don't think there's very much of anything in us outside of God is there for How Far We've gone how many different generations of of Life have happened since the Garden of Eden but anyways brother Adam says that God used Badger skins for a very deliberate purpose to actually represent Humanity Exodus 26 32 and thou shalt hang it upon the pillars four pillars of of wood overlaid with gold their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver and thou shalt hang up the veil under the touches that thou mayest bring in hither within the Veil The Ark of the testimony and they and the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon the Ark of the testimony in the most holy place build the temple build the Tabernacle according to all of the instruction you can go and read it it's a very detailed account of instructing and and they built it all with cunning Works God anointed them I believe brother Bradham says that God anointed all of them to have the skills to have the skilled labor to be able to do it and we know they learned it from a youth and in bondage in Egypt they they learned it from the Egyptians but they were able to take all of that and build a temple a temple a tabernacle for God to live in behind Badger skins you know the the term Badger skins brother Brana mentions that only after 1964. and he mentions it 18 times he mentions in morphe 19 times both of those only after 1964. I think it's amazing when you look at it because what happened in 1963 why could he start talking this way because it truly was the Mighty God being unveiled the unveiling of God in our day that's what the word of God was given to us for he came to select a bride of his own choosing but you know when those seals were opened it became a new book brother Bradham said this book became completely wide open to us there was no more Mysteries the mystery was history at that point but you know even then he asked people do you understand what's going on do you understand it and some people would say yeah and he said no you don't because it's not for you I was given a vision to go and store up food in the Tabernacle for a season and the reason he was told to do that was so that there would be food provision just like Joseph in his day there would be a famine in the land and today there's a famine in the land one of the greatest famines that there ever has been but not for food it's a famine for the word of God a famine for the hearing of the word of God the desire in the heart of man to hear the word of God they don't want to hear that they want to hear about other things they want to hear about Pride they want to hear about gender reassigning they want to hear about the Liberties they want to hear about all this other stuff anything but the word of God the word that God would give to Mankind through a prophet even Christian people denominational folks they want to hear anything but the word of a prophet oh you start talking profit and they'll get uneasy they'll say oh now you're getting crazy just like they did back in the days of Jesus I and my father are one as soon as you start talking now you're talking funny talk now you're a heretic and we gotta do something about you but you know what that is exactly what's happening and when the bride recognizes its position in Christ Jesus then the Rapture will go and it'll be a secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ it won't be a big cataclysmic event but people want to see it the way they want to see it but God gave them what they asked for they said speak to us through a man oh my we're going to die if you talk so he said okay so what's so crazy to believe that God would send a prophet in our day where did that come from who said there wouldn't be a prophet I know I'm talking to people that believe that God sent a prophet so forgive me but I know I'm also talking to people that don't believe that God sent a prophet but you know my prayer is that we would be able to come together and be in one mind and one Accord and think could it be could it possibly be that God sent a prophet and if God sent a prophet what did that Prophet say what would he say to the world in this day and age if he did send a prophet you know what I'm I'm telling you you could find out and if you find out then you're going to be placed in a position of judgment because you're going to have to choose whether you're going to accept it or reject it and one day you're going to stand before the white Throne of judgment and you know we're all going to stand there I heard this said the other day we're all going to stand before that Throne of judgment probably saying brother Barry wait a second the word of God says that we'll be seated with him in his throne and we will and and we will stand before that Throne of judgment it's just a matter of when and where are we going to stand before that Throne of judgment here and now or then and there some people are going then and there but we have the opportunity today through the word of a Vindicated Prophet to stand before that Throne of judgment Here and Now it gives us the way back to the Tree of Life it doesn't scare us to say the name of Jesus Christ and to know that that's the Lord Jesus Christ we're not saying it in a derogatory way we're not saying it as a curse word you know every single time that it's used as a curse word people will answer for it and I say Lord have mercy on me because I know I used it that way oh but one day he revealed to me he pulled back the veil and showed me you know what it's not like you think not at all like you think you know he mentioned Badger skins 18 times after 1964. in the unveiling of God brother batam says now he was behind what a skin Veil see amen Badger skins behind the veil and when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion the veil that he was wrapped in was rent on that day of the crucifixion he says it twice the whole Mercy Seat came into view now the Jews cannot understand how that God could have mercy upon a sinful foul people like we are and I'll say this neither could Satan Satan couldn't believe that either Satan couldn't believe that the god of Glory Elohim the self-existing one the one that Satan knew created him and all the angels and all the universe he couldn't believe that God that being would condescend so far to be in a human being to come down to actually be that one to die and be the Redemption for man now the Jews cannot understand how that God could have mercy upon a sinful foul people like we are but they couldn't see this one who was giving Mercy because he was hid he was behind the mercy seat on the inside with Badger skins isn't it amazing to think brother Branham brings it out so clearly he says those most religious ones the priests the the Levites those those Pharisees and the Sadducees they were talking about this Messiah that was going to come someday there was going to be a great deliverer for for for Israel and they knew it they believed it that there was a messiah coming but they didn't recognize that while they were singing their worship their chants their their Worship in vain teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men they were teaching those and singing those in the temple while they were crucifying their Messiah right there but why were they doing that brothers and sisters the word of God says that they were blinded they had a veil put over their eyes for our sakes brothers and sisters if there's nothing else that we got to worship for maybe God didn't give us the money we wanted maybe we're sick in our bodies maybe we've got a problem in our family maybe there's a situation that we just don't know how to deal with if we don't have anything else to worship about we can worship about that that a whole entire generation of people a whole race of people was actually terribly treated so that we could have the Salvation that we've been given it is amazing when we think about that when that word that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us brothers and sisters was on the cross was on Calvary when they took that word and they nailed it to the cross that word he bowed his head he cried with a loud voice and yielded up the ghost that's what the scripture says but the scripture also says the very next thing that he did his very first order of business when he changed his mask right and morphe he changed his mask he said his Spirit free on his way up to heaven he went into that Temple where they were worshiping and he ripped that Veil he ripped that tradition in half from the top to the bottom and he said right now you're seeing the full view there's nothing hidden from you and right now you're not going to be able to see it but there's going to be a people one day that are going to be able to look right in to the holy of holies they're going to be able to look right into The Mercy Seat they're going to take the word of God and the whole word of God for their day and they're going to be able to see it the first order of business he had was to go and tear down their Traditions to rip that Veil from top to bottom Jesus Matthew 27 verse 50 when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil was of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints who had slept a rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many and I personally this is just my view brothers and sisters as we preach this word this word for our day the message of the hour that God himself has now come down and manifest In the Flesh what we're doing as we do this brothers and sisters is We are tearing back the badger skins of the veil and saying that this is I and my father are one it's not two we are not going to one day get there we are there he is here with us now brother Branham says it in the message he is here he doesn't say he's coming he says he's here so where is he brothers and sisters he's behind the badger skins and I want to recommend today that when we look at one another look at God look at Christ Jesus recognize that he is and morphe according to what the prophet of God said he's hiding behind that Badger skin of humanity when we want to speak about our brother or our sister think about who we really are speaking about because his ears are always open and listening to what our voice has to say remember brother Bradham says he doesn't look at our work she's not looking at our works he's not looking at us in our Humanity he's not looking at our Badger skin he doesn't care about our Badger skin that's why he's not afraid to put us down or bring us up what he's looking for is our response to the word he wants to see spiritual growth in our lives and he ain't afraid to do anything to see that happen in our lives he will always have his will come to pass and his will is his word in our lives I just can't help but think that you know what when we get that recognition that veil of the badger skin is actually just going to tear apart I remember hearing it preach that there's coming a time where we'll have so much Revelation that that wine skin will burst and that badge your skin will burst because of the Revelation and what will happen is the the rocks will run the Earth will shake and the graves will be open and you know it'll be a spiritual thing that happens it's not going to be a big cataclysmic thing like the world thinks it's actually going to happen in Revelation towards the end of the world there will be tremendous earthquakes and and all of that will happen but when the resurrection and the Rapture happens it's going to be a spiritual awakening a spiritual Resurrection out of the graves and I think it's so beautiful because brother Bradham says it that you know he talks about 30 to 40 days he doesn't say it's going to be exactly a month he doesn't say it's actually going to be 40 days he says about 30 or 40 days about 40 days I think he says and you know that's coming brothers and sisters that's the prophet of God he said that it has to happen his word has to come to pass and you know we're going to see the loved ones come to us just like the the many people saw the people come out of the graves and go into the City and they were seen by many it's going to happen there's many Believers in this world many people who say I am my father are one many people who can say be it unto me according to Thy word if this word says that if that's what you wanted to say the Mighty God is unveiled from before our eyes in Badger skins of human beings again if he's here in flesh and I'm that flesh hey be it unto me I don't want to argue with that I just want to say wow I can't even hardly believe that he would choose me and again it just comes to the place where if that's what the prophet of God is saying to us then how much do we have to give him praise how much worship do we have already right there to give to him to think that he would choose you that he would choose me how would he choose me living in a world of sin living in a world of Darkness not knowing up from down not knowing right from wrong not not understanding that God even sent a prophet but one day God will send someone across your path to say you know what God sent a prophet he actually sent his word and I think it's so fantastic I'll say it again I said it already but I'll say it again if God were to send a prophet to the world for the people who are Christians who maybe haven't fully accepted this wouldn't you want to hear what that Prophet had to say but so many people are so caught up with the theory that oh it's got to be some kind of doctrinal thing and we've got to get all caught up and all this other stuff it's it's the devil's in the details is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you know what we read this morning that the spirit is what giveth Life as we come into the the Resurrection season the the spring season I heard it said the other day and and it's probably only about 30 days now but a few days ago they said on the radio that it's spring is 35 days away we get into the the cycle I always do anyways of of it is the rising of the sun it's it's time for Easter when we start to have Easter we start to think about life coming back into the world again in our area the leaves start to turn green the birds start to come back and we start to think about the life that's going to happen and you know can't help but think that one of these days maybe it'll be a spring morning with with no clouds in the sky somewhere between six in the morning and nine in the morning sometime when we're in the midst of our devotions we'll have someone that we love come and sit down and just fellowship with us around the word of God and say just keep pressing on brother you've made it you don't have to worry anymore all of your troubles all of your trials all of it was for this moment and you know what nobody can change it not even you if you want to you've come too far to change it you can't go back even if you want to you know brothers and sisters we're having a conversation this week and last week and the week before and and I'm just gonna keep talking about it I can't help but think about it what would happen if you had an angel of God come to your house and visit you and tell you not to worry about a thing because everything that you're worrying about is irrelevant to the word of God in your life that you are already seated in Heavenly places you are going to make it when the Rapture happens you don't have to have any fears about anything in your life anymore you know what I want to say is that that's that's happened the angel of God has come to your house if you've heard the message of the hour he told you that you already are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he has chosen for his own wife and you know the more we feed on this word the more we can rejoice and be very glad because the bride the wife has made herself ready as we feed on this word brothers and sisters it's the spirit that gives us life this resurrection and Rapture it's gonna happen from inside of here it's not going to be out there somewhere it's going to be the same voice brother Branham says they're called Lazarus from the grave that same voice is going to speak from the Bride of Jesus Christ and say I and my father are one and it's time brother Branham says in the message oh the invisible Union of the Bride there's a time where they were waiting for the fire to fall then he said we've been expecting it we were in Glacier National Park watching for this to happen and where there came a voice one time that said oh things are ready Let the Fire Fall brothers and sisters the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to recognize it one day she's going to look past the Bale The Veil The Badger skins and she's is going to say those very words I believe it with all my heart all things are ready Let the Fire Fall oh my and you know brother Branham says it before one bomb goes off before one bomb goes off and I I want to say this one bomb that can affect the Bride of Jesus Christ before one bomb goes off that can affect the Bride of Jesus Christ boom it's gonna happen but you know what does it it's not us it's not our own inspiration if we try and get ourselves excited about it if we try and work it up it's not going to happen and that's what's gross people out over the years over the decades even around the message of the hour people trying to work it up looking at the first ball looking at the second poll we've got great signs and wonders amongst us it's got nothing to do with it the only thing those things were for was to get people's attention on the word if you've ever fished before you put bait on the hook to get the fish you can throw them the hook out but the fish are going to look at it and think whatever I don't want nothing to do with it but if you put a little bait on that hook then the fish are going to come and nibble and you'll be able to catch them and that's why Jesus said I want to make you Fishers of Men I don't want to make you just Fishers of fish that's nice but there's something more important here and that's two thousand years ago how much more important today brothers and sisters the spirit giveth life out of second Corinthians 3 verse 12 seeing then that we have such a hope we use great plainness of speech we don't have a mystery anymore more we're not talking about great mysterious things we're talking about the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh now walking around on Earth in his bride verse 13 says not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly could not steadfastly look at the end of that which is abolished living under the law we're not living under the law some people are some people are living under works I'm a good person I've I do everything right you know what I would say this the most saintly person is the one who does wrong now you're going to say brother Barry you're getting crazy but I want to say this they're the ones that will say I did wrong forgive me for it will you forgive me for it the ones who are living under the law will say I never did nothing wrong ain't nothing wrong with me look at me you know what that is that's pride gets in our lives it's the original sin goes back to Heaven That's what Satan did and that's what he wants to do to the church today is get so much pride in them they say I've made it everything is fine in my life I go to church I pay my tithes I'm a good member I do all kinds of things for the community i i i tithe I give offerings I even give to missions I've got all this goodness in my life but you know what there's still something wrong inside there's still one little spot inside that's just not dealt with we have to let him in to deal with it in our lives oh my verse 14 says but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart can you imagine that brothers and sisters think about World War II and all the children of Israel how many of those people that went through concentration camps their families were torn apart how many of those people's minds were blinded all of them why were they blinded so that we could be here today to receive the word oh my I got too excited this thing's come apart but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away there's come in a day and it's very soon brothers and sisters where there's going to be two witnesses on the scene and that Veil will be taken away from the 144 000 will be called the elected of Israel and we know we talked about that uh quite a time ago quite a while ago you know isn't it wonderful to look we can see down and is it Ashbury in Tennessee the university they've got that great revival going on and it's gone on for days and you know back in the 70s they had the same thing happen and it's going on and people are coming from all over the place because why because they're desperate to get the spirit of God they want to hear from God and they don't want to hear religion they don't want to hear religion I personally would say this brothers and sisters if they won't receive the message of the hour then then we don't want to put anybody in or better anybody out but those are people that are hungry for the word of God and it's amazing to see when that hunger for the word of God is out there because the prophet of God says when they go looking for that oil when they start crying out for that oil we know the oil is the Holy Ghost and they're even saying it on Fox news that that's the Holy Ghost is outpouring of the Holy Ghost is what they're saying on National Television my goodness when they go looking for that that's when the Rapture goes how close is it maybe it's today maybe it's tomorrow maybe it's in a week maybe it's in 10 years we don't know but it's wonderful to see the spirit of God moving brother Branham says that it's the same spirit don't say that it's the wrong spirit it's the same Spirit falling on those people but if they can't receive the message of the hour I don't want to say anymore brother Adam says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away there's coming a time where the the children of Israel the veil will be taken away and they'll receive this message of the hour they'll receive Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever they'll say oh my how did you get those scars in your hands and he'll say don't worry I got them in the house of my friends and and they'll just start to mourn and lament because they'll recognize when the Messiah was with them they actually are the ones that killed him and he'll say no it wasn't it wasn't actually so that you could be mean to mankind it wasn't so that you could miss it it was to actually preserve life because look out there look at the millions of Christians look at the millions of Bride of Jesus Christ truly elected that you saved because you actually did that what a tremendous blessing that will be for them people verse 17 says now the Lord is that spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty I just love that because you know what that that that right there will just dovetail with what's happening in Ashbury Tennessee right now they ain't reserved they don't care they want to worship God there's people coming from all over the place and they don't care if it's time to close or go home or if the custodians want to clean up they want to worship God and they're just going to keep worshiping God because where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and that's why these people are staying there because the spirit of the Lord is there and I just can't help but think the more I think about this how much more the Sons and Daughters of God those people who never had the veil those people who were truly elected before the foundation of the world where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty my but we all with open faces beholding as in a glass looking into the mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord when we look in the mirror at home brothers and sisters who do we see do we see the badger skin Satan wants us to see the badger skin or do we look in that glass and do we see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the word coming of the Lord the bride coming of Jesus Christ you know what it takes is it takes Revelation faith is a revelation faith is the substance the evidence of things hoped for but it actually takes a revelation of the spirit to Quicken the word in our lives we can't do it on our own we can't just say I want a revelation I'm going to get me a revelation I'm going to go to the library and get a revelation I'm going to go on Google I'm going to get a revelation it ain't going to happen that way we have to sit down with our Bible and invite the spirit of God to actually give us a revelation but if we do that if we open ourselves up to the Lord Jesus Christ and say give me a revelation will you please give me a revelation about this word about this truth about this message about this this this Prophet if you'll do that he'll do it he'll never leave you hanging but it takes the spirit of God to Quicken the word to bring it to life to give us that revelation and the Mighty God unveiled brother Branham he says this and I I told this to a man the other day when this peace had come out about this man being healed the same Minister said they make a God out of you brother Branham I I heard this many many times but I just never heard it this way I think it's beautiful he says well he was a Critic so I thought I'd just kind of break it off just a little bit not to hurt you know but just I I said is that too far from the scripture to be that see is it too far he said see I said no it isn't I said because Jesus called prophets God see that's right now some people would stop right there and say well then you're making brother Bradham God you're saying that William Mary and Branham was God but isn't that what he said the prophets would be they would be God to the people he told Moses that you'll be God to the people and that Aaron will be your priest and if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives whose spirit is the Holy Ghost what spirit is the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters this is where it gets hair uh I don't even know how you say it you'll be a heretic to talk this way when you got the holy ghost in your life denominations will say no you know when you when you actually just represent part of the gift when you just say that I've had this manifestation or I've had that manifestation then you've got it no it's not about that the only evidence is the ability to receive the word but the word is going to be the fullness of the word it's not going to be a partial word we don't want to say just speaking in tongues because that's only one of the nine spiritual gifts that was given to the church when we get it we get the fruit of the spirit his spirit in our lives he goes on to say and then and and and and they say well you people try to take the place of God that's not too far out that's exactly what it is that's exactly he says for me I was like wow I don't think I've ever heard this before he says God manifested in flesh just as he promised now we could take it from the maybe the unbeliever's perspective that people don't believe that God said a prophet and we could actually take it and let the pendulum swing all the way the other way and there's people that will say well you know what yeah William Mary and Bradham he had the spirit of God and he was the wave Chief and he had all the manifestation all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into William Mary and Branham and that's where it stays and now we have to actually wait for him to come back and finish something off you know what that does that stops the spirit of God we can't make him God he took himself off of the mission field to say you're making me Antichrist to make me God he's not God he was pointing to God and it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters the reason he came was to call out a bride for God's own choosing it's the same story as Ellie easier going and finding a bride Rebecca for Isaac that whole story we're not going to get into it today but it's the same thing he came to call out a bride for Jesus Christ he says that's exactly what it is that's exactly God manifested in flesh just as he promised I don't think I ever really caught him saying that ever before I thought man that's good and you know some might say while he was just trying to put that man off would brother Bradham lie ever he admitted to lying once just by I think attrition by saying you know I know who's on the phone so I'm just going to step outside and and I'm not here right and we know that God dealt with him on that but he wasn't a liar so if God was manifest In the Flesh then where is he I think it's just beautiful brothers and sisters he goes on to say oh my out of the Mighty God unveiled and God what he does he just changes himself to become to that generation to make known himself to that people and that's what we're here to find out tonight in what way is God supposed to make himself known to this people in this time he changes his mask he changes his act but he doesn't change his disposition he doesn't change his nature he just changes his mask from one to another he does it to reveal himself more more plain to the people I'm really sorry this thing is starting to poke me in the in the head here it's really annoying he says I'm going to go back and read this without distraction I apologize and God what he does he just changes himself to become to that generation to make known himself to that people and that's what we're here to find out tonight in what way is God supposed to make himself known to this people and in this time and I just think why we're here today is to hear that to understand that to get the revelation of that what what God is actually doing in our day what that's what we're here to find out tonight in what way is God supposed to make himself known to this people and in this time he changed changes his mask he changes his act but he doesn't change his disposition he doesn't change his nature he just changes his mask from one to another he does it to reveal himself more plain to the people that they might know who he is and what he is when the church recognizes its position brothers and sisters then the Rapture will go the church isn't going to be a denomination it's not the message of the hour will never be denominated because it's Christ it's the life of Jesus Christ the spirit is what gives it life it brings this word it quickens this word that he's given us but it'll never be denominated it's not going to be a denomination that actually gets it what it is going to be is Jesus Christ in plain view no longer hidden behind the veil of the badger skins and for some people it's almost like he is hidden behind the badger skins that we have to come into a holy nature we have to come into a a royal priesthood which is what the word says we have to come in and and have some kind of works some kind of first or second pole manifestation but that's not where we're at today brothers and sisters we're already inside the inner Veil where the Ark of the Covenant is we're not going to get there someday we're already there you know brother Bradham says it in uh my someone would probably know the message I think it might be Christ The Mystery of God revealed I can't remember now but brother Branham says that you never did it in the first place yeah it is invisible Union isn't it you never did it he says first it's as though you never did it in the first place but then a couple paragraphs later he says you never did do it in the first place the only thing that happened is we bypassed our theophanes he chose to express us through the parents that we have and we came to Earth with that seed Gene of God and and we didn't know it we have spiritual Amnesia every one of us but somewhere along the way maybe it's from birth maybe it's not maybe it's somewhere along the way in the Journey of our life somewhere along the way the word of God quickens that seed Gene to life in our lives and we can't help but manifest what we are and you know that's the way it is for everyone the rain's going to fall in the just and the unjust and the word of God is what's going to do the dividing brothers and sisters it's not going to be us putting someone in or taking someone out there's times where we need to exercise that in the church sure if we have someone dealing living in rank sin where we need to actually address it because that will offend it will upset the spirit of God but when we're all just brothers and sisters coming together there's no need for us to be judging one another we should be judging ourselves and if we can judge ourselves then what will happen is we'll set the atmosphere to come together in one mind and one Accord and we know he's the same yesterday today and forever and when we do that brothers and sisters don't be the same way as it was in in the day of Pentecost he'll come in the room and it'll be like a rushing Mighty Wind we're not looking for great signs and wonders some might be saying well brother bear you got a Pentecostal background so maybe you're looking for a great manifestation you know what where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and I think that if they can get that excited about the word in this place down south what about the Sons and Daughters of God you know the mercy see today brothers and sisters was just like it was on the day of Calvary when when Christ was crucified his first order of business when he was crucified when his work was completed In the Flesh on Earth was to separate that veil was to say it is no longer going to stand between man and God and and what it was was the traditions of men he went in and he tore it and we know that he was doing that from the very beginning of his ministry they they thought he was a heretic in his day Jesus eating with unwashing hands and dealing with all this stuff you know he was actually tearing that Veil from the beginning of his ministry they couldn't deal with him they didn't know how to deal with him because he was making himself God in many different manifestations they wanted to kill him because it was just too much for them to deal with and it's going to be the same way for us today brothers and sisters they ain't going to want one of any one of us claiming that we're God but you know what when you have a lot of money in your pocket when you got a lot of money in your bank account you don't need to brag do you you don't have to go and tell the world hey I got lots of money you don't see my bank account I don't have to carry a Big Fat Sweaty wad of cash in my pocket bulging out for the world to see I'm loaded man look at me you know what spiritually speaking brothers and sisters you're loaded your bank account is endless you don't got nothing to prove we don't got nothing to prove we're going to go forward and just live this word and he'll do the dividing he'll do the the separating this Mercy Seat came into full view Brother Brad I'm out of the Mighty God unavailable for us now when the veil was rented Calvary The Mercy Seat came into Plain View but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood many times we talk about that veil in the temple but what was on the cross brothers and sisters that was a veil it was there he says but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood as they had took blood year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary and the sprinkling of The Mercy Seat there god with his Great Mighty stroke of lightning power split the old Badger Veil from the top to the bottom and The Mercy Seat came into Plain View we can look at that and say Jesus Christ was The Mercy Seat that came into plain view my goodness to think that we have been given access back to that tree of life he goes on to say the real genuine Lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary the real Mercy Seat when God had paid the price himself and became one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we acquainted with him The Mercy Seat was in plain view of all Israel on that day of atonement I just think this is fascinating I don't think I've ever looked at it this way I don't think I've ever looked at Jesus Christ as a veil I know that the children of Israel were veiled through Jesus Christ in his ministry but I don't think I've ever looked at Jesus Christ himself as a veil goes on to say but alas the traditions of the church fathers in that day had by their traditions had veiled the true Mercy Seat from the people if they would have known the scripture each piece would have come like the old Chinese tag you remember brother I'm talking about the Chinese Laundry how they would they couldn't write English so what they would do is they would write on it in in Chinese and they would just tear the tag and give you half and and and keep half and when you came back you would have to have the other half that would match up that's what he's referring to the old Chinese tag the Old Testament prophecy would have been fulfilled and it was and if they had been taught the scripture they would have seen The Mercy Seat as Moses said here that to this day they're veiled it's still over their hearts they don't see it and some people many people today are still failed they just don't see it they feel like there's something that they've got to do there's something where that they've got to go there's some some someone they've got to talk to maybe a great minister or a great ministry brothers and sisters you have all the ministry inside of you right now if you have the Holy Ghost in your life you have all of the ministry that you'll ever need right now in your life you don't have to have a healing campaign you don't have to have a great ministry you don't have to travel to a geographical location you just have to have the faith in your heart the evidence of Things Not Seen to be able to call the things that aren't as though they are and the things that are as though they aren't it gets crazy when you start doing that when you start saying No this problem it's not a problem no it's not a problem it's just the devil when we start doing that other people don't see it necessarily the same way I love how brother Bradham says it was the traditions of their fathers Traditions sometimes we can have Traditions brothers and sisters that can get in the way they can create a veil is what brother Branham says in this message the the the tradition can be you know what we've never done it this way before so why are you trying to do it this way this is different than we've always done imagine how much different it was in Jesus day when he was living out his ministry when he was the word made flesh dwelling among them if we're going to live in a position where we say you know what we have to do it the way that we've always done it you know we're only going to get what we've ever got because we're just going to keep doing the same way we've done it the children of Israel they didn't have a choice they had to follow that Pillar of Fire when it marched they had to follow that cloud the traditions of the fathers is what blinds them brother Branham says it now men women and delegates of this convention I want to say this without respective persons but in the my in in in in The View today in the view of what we're here for today I'm afraid that the traditions of the fathers the church fathers he's talking about it in 1964 USA I'm afraid that the traditions of the fathers the church Affairs has hid this from too many people since the Holy Ghost has come in this last days as prophesied in the veil has been rent too many people try to hang to their traditions of the fathers and that's why they can't see this extreme joy and peace and things that the church has today yet it's in plain view of those who believe again I just can't help but think about that that thing going on in the United States in that University do you think those young people care about the way their parents worship back in the Anglican church or in the Catholic church or whatever Church they they're from they don't care about their Traditions they can see the spirit of God as moving and there's liberty here and they just want to worship they just want to praise God how much more the Sons and Daughters of God brothers and sisters don't let the traditions of the fathers get in the way you know Matthew 15 if if we could just turn to Matthew 15 we still have two minutes Matthew 15 verse 1. are we okay today maybe that's 20 minutes according to a preacher not that we lie Matthew 15. Matthew 15 verse 1. very familiar scripture then came Jesus came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do the disciples transgress the tradition of the elders here he is tearing the Veil right there why why do why why do the disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus he have made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition he says ye Hypocrites well did isaiahs prophesy of you saying the people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and he called unto the multitude and said and and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth the man our traditions and our teachings brothers and sisters can get in the way of this word of God from having the position that it rightfully wants in our lives that he rightfully wants in our lives you know it's interesting that he talks about honoring your father and mother and and saying in verse 5 but she say whosoever shall say to his father or a mother it's a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me what he's talking about is saying you know what I'm I'm your gift I'm the one that's actually here for you I know more than you I can actually teach you I actually can give you you need to respect me now because I'm me see me and it goes against the word of God it's not a conditional thing to honor your mother or your father and we talked about it how teenagers come to a place I'm sorry but I've experienced it I'm sure a couple other people might have where you might just become equally smart with your parents I'll say it that way I felt like I was smarter than mine but you know what it's just this scripture it's this scripture coming to pass thinking that there's maybe something good in me you know what there's nothing good in any of us all we need to do is humble ourselves to the word of God and not let any tradition not not think that we can do anything on our own it's only by his spirit that we have the ability to live and do what we do it's only by his grace that we're saved through faith in his word not of Works lest any man should boast you know what we're talking about is god with skin on brother Bradham says in this message will you when you come out from behind the veil you'll be in full view of the people then that they can see that something has happened to you the veiled word I just love how he brings it right down to our level I'll call the musicians because I am actually ending and look at that can you believe it I got it in at the end oh I'll show you afterwards it's been a needle poking me in the back of the skull for half the service we're talking about god with skin on he says well you when you come out from behind the veil you'll be in full view of the people then that they can see that something has happened to you the veiled word to the unbeliever but in full view of the believer it's beautiful isn't it when we look at one another when we see Believers we see the full word and view this is what Brother Brad I'm saying here we're seeing the full word in view it's not another man it's not another woman it's Jesus Christ a full word in plain view in our day he says that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then it was God in them days it was God in a man his son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in man God in man and we've read this in Ephesians we could go there but for time's sake I won't I'll spare you for it you know what it says in there that we should be able to comprehend with All Saints what this mystery of God is the height of it the depth of it the length of it the breadth of it that we should be able to comprehend this with all saints that we should be able to recognize that there's no more mystery and and and that we should be filled with not just a part of the fullness of God but all of the fullness of God brother Adam says we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God and a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in man God in man that's who Jesus Christ was and is and forever will be we don't want to ever go off on a tangent that way maybe stand with me as we close this morning he says now it's God in men it's not just God and a man don't put God and William Mary and Bradham and say it's just God and a man now we're waiting for something to happen if you do that you're doing what brother Branham said man is always good at looking back at what God has always done and looking forward to what God's always doing but ignoring what he's doing right now brothers and sisters right now he's trying to tell you that you are God in flesh now it's God and Men the fullness of God in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word as we March forwards as we live this word in our lives brothers and sisters it's exactly what the prophet of God says here he says now we find God in all Angels ages has had skin on it he God has been hid behind a veil badge your skin you know I'm going to close with this scripture here because we we read this here in in second Corinthians I'll just read it here not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord we know that in First Corinthians 13 He says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come brothers and sisters then that which isn't in part shall be done away with that which is perfect is coming the word of God for our day we have a perfect word and you know what we've been given through Revelation in this word we've been given a perfect realization of this word a perfect revelation of this word if we accept Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if we don't put them out there and make them something in the future and look at them in the past and say that he's something back there but if we accept him as he is today then we have a perfect realization a perfect revelation of this word when that which is perfect is come and that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child and understood as a child but thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things spiritual maturity understanding there comes a time where our maturity level grows to a place where we're no longer children coming to church we're recognizing that we don't need a great ministry somewhere out there that we are that great ministry as we live this word in our lives when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly he know that he was talking to the Corinthians back there now we see through a glass Darkly but then as Moses desired brothers and sisters he could only see the higher parts of God and he said I'll put you up upon that rock of Revelation and your face will shine because of that Revelation oh but Paul prophesying of that he says now we see through a glass Darkly but then we'll see face to face brothers and sisters as we look into this word of God for our day we see him face to face oh my we see we'll know then face to face face to face and now I know in part but then shall I be known even as I am also known you know this is the last quote and then I'm gonna quit brother Branham says the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth it's not just being a Christian and saying that I'm Associated and I I do good things in my life it's truly having the baptism of the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ in your life it's not just being an associate member the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together well the Revelation is in Perfect Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest think about those people down in the states brothers and sisters when you read that quote when you listen to that what are you going to do when you get that group together whether Revelation is perfectly in harmony where they know the spirit of God is there and where there is Liberty where the spirit of God is it's God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making his word manifest he says oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is what is it Jesus Christ manifest in flesh because the great mystery is that the twain will become one we're going to talk about this message further I think there's more to it but you know brother Branham talks about how different people have different claims on his life he's he's a husband to his wife he's a father to his child he's a son to his parents there's different manifestations but it can still be just one person and many different claims on that one person it's the same with Jesus Christ oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is he says now notice you say brother Branham but that that ain't he says oh yes it is too prophet of God saying this oh yes it is too don't doubt it brothers and sisters yes it is too you know I just couldn't help but think about this When I Was preparing this this is getting a bit crazy talking like this but I just believe it's really the call for our day brothers and sisters it's it's it's not about learning how to live better on this world it's understanding that there is a call for our day where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and the Liberty isn't to get excited and have great song services and have a a great big feel-good group of people it's about recognizing that that Liberty is going to be an eternal Liberty that when we truly realize our position than the Rapture is going to go the dead in Christ will rise first and then we who are alive and remain shall meet together with them in the clouds we will see Jesus in the clouds and you know the children of Israel when they are crossing over into their Promised Land that's what we're talking about crossing over into our promised land when they went they said you know what no one has ever gone this way before you need to keep your eyes focused on that Ark the the the the the Levites are gonna go They're Gonna March they've been given the marching orders from God through the prophet there was a transition from profit to profit and we know that Joshua didn't have his commission until Moses was off the scene but then God started to speak to the people through him and he said you know what I'm going to magnify myself through you because he's gone but he said keep your eyes on that Ark keep your eyes on the word and I want to say today brothers and sisters keep your eyes on that word don't don't keep your eyes on the works don't look for Works to say if I see works then I'll try and keep my eyes on the word don't don't do it the whole world's doing that there's a whole bunch of people down in the states at a university right now doing that don't do that keep your eyes on the yard keep your eyes on the word gotta recognize that nobody has ever gone this way before nobody has ever gone the way of the Rapture the general resurrection and Rapture of the church that's never happened before there's been a couple of people that actually pleased God and we're not we know that but but the general resurrection and Rapture has never happened nobody has ever gone this way before and I'm not saying I've got the words of wisdom to get us there all I'm saying is put the word of God first in your life take the word that was given to us through the
