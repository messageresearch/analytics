[0:02] um I had the song in my heart yesterday
[0:05] I was just uh
[0:07] listening to some songs that were
[0:09] written by Brother Leon yearns
[0:12] um and uh this particular one just came
[0:16] to my heart and I asked my brother to
[0:17] sing along with me
[0:19] the title is just say the right word
[0:22] and part of you know this song says that
[0:25] just approach him with the right
[0:28] attitude
[0:30] and I said to myself Lord help me
[0:33] because I remember brother Brown said as
[0:35] well that the right attitude to any
[0:38] Divine promise will bring it to pass
[0:42] but many times I Stumble at
[0:45] The Vessel I stumbled at the Badger's
[0:47] King
[0:48] and I say Lord help me not to stumble at
[0:50] that because the promise is behind the
[0:52] budget skin and my attitude to the
[0:55] body's King is my attitude
[0:58] to the Divine promise
[1:00] I pray you'll be blessed this morning
