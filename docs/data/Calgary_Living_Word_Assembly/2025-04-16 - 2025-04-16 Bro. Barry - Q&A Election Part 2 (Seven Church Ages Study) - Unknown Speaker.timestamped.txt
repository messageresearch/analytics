[27:17] Sunday asking us the

[42:10] tonight?
[42:13] Hallelujah. What a blessing that is.
[42:16] [Music]
[42:18] It's one
[42:20] thing to know that you know
[42:23] him, but it's a totally new level when
[42:28] you know that he knows
[42:30] you. And I believe that's the day in
[42:33] which we're
[42:34] living. That is the revelation that we
[42:37] are thriving under. Amen. Is that he
[42:40] knows us each and every one by name.
[42:43] Amen.
[42:45] We just have a couple of requests
[42:47] tonight. we would like to remember in
[42:50] prayer. But first, we have a praise
[42:54] report and uh just exactly the way I
[42:57] like
[42:58] it. And uh it's it's a praise report
[43:02] from sister Marcy about her dad. And she
[43:06] says, "I want to share wonderful report
[43:08] of
[43:10] God's God's grace to our family.
[43:15] father had repeated surgery today
[43:19] postsurgery for bladder
[43:21] cancer and his surgeon
[43:24] reported that there could be return of
[43:28] tumors anywhere in the bladder and he
[43:31] was very happily surprised how great
[43:34] things
[43:35] looked when he went in
[43:39] Thursday or went
[43:41] in December of last year. You know, the
[43:45] Lord can change things through
[43:48] prayer. It's a wonderful thing to see
[43:50] that the Lord has moved in brother Frank
[43:53] Kronhite's life.
[43:55] And if he can do it for him, he can do
[43:58] it for anyone.
[44:00] That's the kind of God we
[44:03] serve. So, we thank the Lord for
[44:05] touching brother Frank Kronite and we
[44:08] just pray the Lord would continue to
[44:09] watch over him and brother Peter while
[44:12] he's away. And we'd also like to pray
[44:14] for Sister Judith DS who's at home not
[44:17] feeling well with
[44:18] vertigo. And uh if you have a need
[44:21] tonight, maybe just make it known unto
[44:23] him by way of an uplift hand. We also
[44:25] would like to remember the Lucas family.
[44:28] That's the family of my former pastor
[44:31] when I was a child in Calgary here. He
[44:34] passed away on Monday and uh he was 89
[44:39] years old.
[44:41] Now he's uh fellowshipping on the other
[44:43] side. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly
[44:47] Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful
[44:49] for your word. So thankful that you've
[44:52] made it real to us, Lord, that it's not
[44:54] just in print. It's not just on pages,
[44:57] but it's actually a living word because
[44:59] we've taken the book and we've eaten it,
[45:01] Lord. And Father, we just pray that
[45:03] Lord, tonight you would be glorified in
[45:06] all that's said and done here. Thank you
[45:08] for the worship tonight, Lord. Father,
[45:10] we pray that you were pleased with our
[45:13] worship. Father, we pray that you would
[45:15] just be with the family of the Lucases,
[45:19] Lord, and all those who are mourning at
[45:21] the loss of John Lucas Senior tonight.
[45:25] We know that he was a a father. He was a
[45:27] a pastor. He was a chairman. He was oh
[45:31] Lord, a
[45:32] husband. We know that he was a
[45:34] grandfather. many titles, but Father, we
[45:38] know that he's come to your house
[45:40] tonight. And we thank you for his life.
[45:43] Lord, we know that he's done good for
[45:45] the bride here in
[45:46] Calgary. And Lord Jesus, we pray for his
[45:49] family tonight that you would strengthen
[45:51] them and encourage them. Father, we want
[45:54] to remember the Clawson family tonight,
[45:56] Lord, as they prepare to celebrate the
[45:59] life of Brother Pete Clawson, another
[46:01] soldier who fought the good fight for
[46:04] many years.
[46:05] is also in your house tonight. Father,
[46:09] we pray that you would bless the family
[46:10] members, Lord, each and every one as
[46:13] they gather together to remember brother
[46:15] Pete Clawson this weekend. Father, we
[46:18] thank you for the praise report for
[46:20] brother Frank Kronhite. We know that
[46:22] you're more than able, Lord. And one
[46:24] more time, we acknowledge who the healer
[46:27] is, Father. And we thank you for do
[46:29] doing that, for touching him, Lord. We
[46:31] pray that you would continue to
[46:33] encourage Brother Frank and sister
[46:35] Pamela. Pray that you'd be with Brother
[46:37] Peter while he's away. Father, that you
[46:38] would keep your hand upon him and bring
[46:40] him home safely at the appointed time.
[46:43] And Father, also request for Sister
[46:46] Judith DS tonight. Lord, battling with
[46:50] vertigo. Father, we just want to rebuke
[46:51] that devil in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:53] tonight for our sister. stand with her,
[46:56] Lord, believing that if you can heal
[46:58] bladder cancer, that you could shoe away
[47:01] a vertical demon, Lord. And Father, we
[47:04] pray that you would just bring her
[47:05] peace, Lord, stability and and and
[47:09] understanding, Lord, that she would not
[47:11] be feeling the effects of of this thing
[47:14] they call vertigo. And Lord Jesus,
[47:17] tonight, as we turn to your word, we
[47:18] pray that you would just be glorified.
[47:20] We pray that you would anoint the word
[47:22] that's read and spoke tonight, Father,
[47:24] that it it would minister to our hearts,
[47:26] Lord. That Father, one more time, word
[47:29] cell upon word cell, we would change,
[47:32] Father. Amen. Lord Jesus, we love you
[47:35] tonight. We pray that you would be with
[47:36] all those who couldn't come tonight.
[47:37] Wherever they are, Father, whether we're
[47:39] working or traveling or at home and
[47:42] indifferent, Lord, either way, we pray
[47:44] that you would just bless them
[47:46] abundantly, Father, above all they could
[47:48] ask or think. Lord Jesus, tonight we
[47:51] love you and we thank you for all these
[47:53] things. We just commit this service now
[47:54] into your hands for your glory. In Jesus
[47:57] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank
[48:00] you, musicians. Thank you, brother Toby,
[48:02] for the wonderful special
[48:05] I love that
[48:06] saxophone. There's just something about
[48:09] a saxophone, isn't there? Something
[48:10] about every instrument you can just find
[48:13] the notes to express. Boy, certainly
[48:17] wonderful. If you have your Bibles
[48:18] tonight, I would like to continue
[48:20] talking about this uh thing called
[48:22] election in second Peter, the second
[48:25] epistle of Peter, chapter 1.
[48:29] It's such a
[48:33] uh call it a deep topic. I just don't
[48:35] think that we can really do it justice
[48:37] on Wednesday nights, but we're going to
[48:39] try. So, we'll uh hopefully maybe settle
[48:43] some nerves, some questions about
[48:46] this this question about election and
[48:50] how can it be that some people are
[48:53] actually
[48:54] created to win and some to lose. Some
[48:58] are created to be vessels of honor and
[49:01] some are created to be vessels of
[49:03] dishonor. Some are created to live and
[49:06] some are created to die.
[49:09] And that's just the way it is. That's
[49:11] God. But tonight, we're going to try and
[49:13] take another step towards maybe getting
[49:16] a little bit of an understanding towards
[49:18] this because even in our human minds, as
[49:20] much as we study this out, I don't think
[49:21] we could ever comprehend it. The prophet
[49:24] even says it. We'll get to that. I think
[49:25] we did last week bit. Um, so bear with
[49:28] me. If it seems like maybe we're
[49:29] repeating a little bit, we will be. It's
[49:32] uh it's just I think it's going to take
[49:34] that to really maybe get to where we
[49:37] need to, Lord willing. The second
[49:39] epistle of Peter, chapter 1, Simon
[49:42] Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus
[49:44] Christ, to them that have obtained like
[49:47] precious faith with us through the
[49:50] righteousness of God and our savior
[49:53] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[49:56] multiplied unto you through the
[49:59] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[50:02] Isn't that absolutely wonderful how the
[50:05] Lord expresses this through his apostle
[50:09] through this epistle, this letter that
[50:11] was written? Grace and peace be
[50:14] multiplied unto you. Not confusion or
[50:17] frustration or or uncertainty or fear,
[50:20] but grace and
[50:23] peace accepting sorry according as his
[50:26] divine power. Verse three, hath given
[50:28] unto all us all things that pertain unto
[50:32] life and godliness through the knowledge
[50:35] of him that hath called us to glory and
[50:38] virtue. Amen. And we know virtue is
[50:43] strength. Whereby are given unto us
[50:46] exceeding great and precious promises,
[50:48] that by these ye might be partakers of
[50:51] the divine nature, having escaped the
[50:53] corruption that is in the world through
[50:56] lust. I love the the exceeding great and
[51:00] precious promises. Verse five. And
[51:03] beside this, giving all diligence,
[51:06] making sure that we're very careful to
[51:09] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[51:12] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[51:14] and to temperance patience, and to
[51:15] patience godliness. To godliness,
[51:17] brotherly kindness. To brotherly
[51:19] kindness charity. And we know charity is
[51:23] sometimes referred to as love. But
[51:25] tonight, we're going to say charity is
[51:27] the Holy Ghost. Charity is the literal
[51:30] life of Jesus Christ. For if these
[51:34] things be in you and abound, they make
[51:37] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[51:41] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[51:44] Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these
[51:47] things is blind and cannot see a far
[51:49] off, and hath forgotten that he was
[51:52] purged from his old sins.
[51:55] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[51:58] diligence, be very careful, give
[52:00] diligence to make your calling and
[52:04] election sure. For if you do these
[52:07] things, ye shall never fall. To think
[52:10] that if we are willing to be diligent
[52:14] about our calling and
[52:17] election, we will never fall. What a
[52:19] tremendous thing that is. Let's bow one
[52:22] more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[52:24] tonight, we just pray that you would
[52:27] help us, Lord, to be diligent about this
[52:29] calling and election, Father, in our
[52:31] lives. Help us to recognize the
[52:33] importance of it, Lord. That it is the
[52:35] pearl of great price, Father, that we
[52:37] could have all kinds of investments, but
[52:39] there is no greater investment than this
[52:43] right here that we're looking at
[52:44] tonight. So, Father, as we look upon
[52:46] these words, we pray that your spirit
[52:48] would just quicken them to our souls. In
[52:51] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God
[52:53] bless you tonight. You may be
[52:57] seated. Certainly thankful to be here
[52:59] tonight. We will be heading out on uh
[53:02] Friday to go out to Saskatchewan and uh
[53:06] celebrate the life of brother Pete
[53:08] Clawson and uh to see the family and so
[53:11] on. We'll be spending a little bit of
[53:13] time in Saskatoon. We'll be coming back
[53:15] the following Thursday. Okay, we're
[53:17] going to see a whole bunch of people. Uh
[53:20] once again, it's just tremendous to to
[53:22] be able to see everyone to visit. But
[53:24] so, Brother Emanuel will take the
[53:26] service on Sunday. I apologize for the
[53:29] uh delay in communion. We're not going
[53:31] to uh cancel it. We're just postponing
[53:34] it. So, we'll get that done when we
[53:37] return. And uh we'll just see how things
[53:40] pan out. I don't even know if we'll be
[53:42] able to get it in this month, but um
[53:44] it's not the kind of thing we really
[53:46] want to rush anyway. So, we will
[53:48] definitely be having a communion service
[53:49] soon. And uh so, Brother Emanuel take
[53:52] the service on Sunday, just one service,
[53:54] and then uh we'll have brother Mvin take
[53:57] the service on Wednesday, Lord willing.
[54:00] Certainly excited to listen to the
[54:02] sermons on our six and a half to seven
[54:05] hour drive. will definitely pick up the
[54:08] uh recordings and I always enjoy doing
[54:11] that. It's just so wonderful to to have
[54:13] the support of the brethren in the
[54:15] congregation that will be able to step
[54:17] in when you're
[54:19] away. So yeah, we're going to uh
[54:21] celebrate the life of brother Pete
[54:23] Clawson and uh what a soldier he was and
[54:27] uh yeah, certainly pray for the families
[54:30] and uh all the people that will be
[54:32] coming
[54:33] from far away. He has a lot of a few
[54:36] children in the states that will be
[54:38] traveling and we just want to want to
[54:41] see that everyone has a as good a time
[54:44] as possible. I guess it's never easy
[54:46] when we have to let go of someone on
[54:48] this side of eternity. But we don't uh
[54:51] mourn as others mourn, do we? When
[54:53] someone crosses over as a believer, we
[54:55] know it becomes a celebration of life.
[54:58] It's not a a sorrowful funeral even
[55:02] though it can be and and is sometimes we
[55:06] have a promise that is so tremendous and
[55:09] I think that promise lies in you know
[55:11] verse 11 of second Peter chapter 1. It
[55:14] says for so an entrance shall be
[55:17] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[55:19] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[55:22] Savior Jesus Christ. to think that when
[55:26] we breathe out our last breath here, we
[55:29] actually breathe in our next breath
[55:32] there. We don't actually stop. We just
[55:36] take the step from this portion of our
[55:39] lives into the next portion. And what a
[55:42] tremendous portion that is that waits
[55:45] for the believers, those
[55:47] elected. You know, I I'm I'm probably
[55:50] not going to read everything that I did
[55:52] last time just so we can actually get
[55:54] going. If you would like to uh know
[55:56] where it's from, it's from the
[55:57] exposition of the seven church ages out
[55:59] of the Sardis and church age. And if you
[56:02] were to look this up at home, you could
[56:05] probably pick it up from the recording
[56:06] or if you wanted to write it down. If
[56:08] you just wrote down, now let us go
[56:10] another step. If you type that into your
[56:13] message app search, it would take you
[56:14] right to this place in uh the exposition
[56:17] of the seven church ages. Now, let us go
[56:19] another step. But before we do, let us
[56:21] review our case thus
[56:24] far. First of all, we know most
[56:26] assuredly that the purpose of God stands
[56:29] in
[56:31] election. The purpose of God, God's
[56:34] entire purpose stands in election.
[56:39] That's why I say, you know, brothers and
[56:40] sisters, we can we can poke at this and
[56:42] and we can look at it through the
[56:44] knowledge through the lens of the
[56:45] message of the hour and, you know,
[56:47] through the revelation that we've been
[56:48] given, but I don't know if we can ever
[56:50] really fully comprehend how powerful the
[56:53] idea of election really is to uh the
[56:57] human race. But he says, let us go
[56:59] another step. Before we do, let us
[57:01] review our case thus far. First of all,
[57:02] we know most assuredly that the purpose
[57:04] of God stands in election. It was
[57:06] purposed in himself. It was God's
[57:08] purpose to bring forth a people like
[57:10] unto himself that would be a word bride.
[57:14] If you want to hear about this, just
[57:16] listen to the masterpiece or just listen
[57:18] to the the masterpiece of all the ages.
[57:21] Either one of those two messages in
[57:23] 1964. Just absolute masterpieces.
[57:26] Brother Brandham talks about this exact
[57:28] thing. He wanted to see a man created in
[57:31] his own image so that he could
[57:33] fellowship. It's fantastic. She was
[57:36] chosen before the foundation of the
[57:38] world in him. She was fornown and
[57:41] beloved before she was ever brought
[57:43] forth during the ages upon the earth.
[57:46] She was redeemed by his blood. And isn't
[57:50] that beautiful? She's not going to be
[57:51] redeemed. She was redeemed by his blood
[57:54] and can never come into the
[57:56] condemnation. We said that last time.
[57:59] Never. She can never come into the
[58:01] condemnation. Now, when we talk about
[58:03] this, I think it's important because
[58:05] sometimes we can look at it and say,
[58:08] "Well, because of that, I can live
[58:09] however I want to. The prophet said
[58:12] this, but I can do that. The word of God
[58:15] says this, but I can do that. I'm going
[58:17] to make it anyways, right? I'm bride, so
[58:20] it's all going to be fine." Sure enough,
[58:22] you get into Calvinism and Armenianism.
[58:25] We're not going to get in that tonight.
[58:27] We're not going to go and and go too far
[58:29] into that. But you can actually come to
[58:30] the place where you can say because
[58:32] God's going to actually see me as an
[58:34] elected one, I can turn make grace a
[58:39] disgrace. And a true believer will never
[58:41] do that. A true believer will always
[58:44] have the desire to serve God according
[58:46] to his will, which is his word and
[58:48] according to the word that was given to
[58:51] a vindicated prophet to the age in which
[58:53] those people live. That is the elected
[58:56] true believer. They're the ones that
[58:59] will never come into the condemnation.
[59:01] The ones that live loose and just do
[59:03] whatever they want to do. Even though
[59:05] there is a vindicated prophet with a
[59:07] message with a clear direction on the
[59:08] way things are supposed to be done, the
[59:10] ones that want to do that, I want to say
[59:13] maybe they fit into one of the other
[59:14] categories because the true believer,
[59:16] the truly elected one is going to be so
[59:20] close to her husband that he could start
[59:22] a sentence and she could finish it.
[59:25] The word is in the bride. She has the
[59:29] mind of Christ to know what to do with
[59:31] that word.
[59:34] She's not looking to put a spin on it.
[59:35] She's not looking for a a loophole like
[59:38] some people want to do. Remember, the
[59:41] devil is in the
[59:43] details. God is in revelation. Amen. His
[59:47] blood can never by his blood and can
[59:50] never come into condemnation. She can
[59:52] never be in the judgment because sin
[59:54] cannot be imputed onto her. Nobody can
[59:57] even impute sin to her. Can you imagine
[59:59] that? Can you imagine that? That's such
[1:00:01] a powerful thought. We have the accuser
[1:00:03] of the brethren standing there right now
[1:00:05] trying to accuse every single one of us.
[1:00:08] And all he says is, you know what? I see
[1:00:11] that bumper of blood. I see that
[1:00:14] sacrifice that I
[1:00:16] made before the foundation of the world
[1:00:18] for each and every one of them. I don't
[1:00:20] even see them. Brother Bradom says it. I
[1:00:22] just listened to it. He says, "He
[1:00:23] doesn't see us. He hears our voice."
[1:00:27] It's beautiful. Romans 4:8, "Blessed is
[1:00:30] the the man whom the Lord will not
[1:00:33] impute sin, but indeed she shall be with
[1:00:37] him in his throne of judgment, judging
[1:00:39] the world and even angels."
[1:00:42] Her name each of her members was written
[1:00:46] in a section of the lamb's book of life
[1:00:49] before the foundation of the world.
[1:00:51] That's the first category of people.
[1:00:53] That's the first category of people that
[1:00:55] he talks about in this in this here. He
[1:00:57] goes on to say, secondly, there's
[1:00:59] another class. Their names are also in
[1:01:01] the book of life and they will come in
[1:01:02] the second resurrection. Such are the
[1:01:04] foolish virgins and the righteous as are
[1:01:08] spoken of in Matthew 25. In this class
[1:01:10] also are those who do not worship the
[1:01:12] beast or become involved in the
[1:01:14] antichrist system but die for their
[1:01:16] faith even though they are not in the
[1:01:18] bride not having been born again. But
[1:01:21] they will come up in the second
[1:01:23] resurrection and go into eternal life. I
[1:01:26] want to say this. Those are the ones
[1:01:28] that actually can't hear this message of
[1:01:31] the hour. Those are the ones that will
[1:01:32] not go in the rapture of the church of
[1:01:35] the living God.
[1:01:37] Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
[1:01:39] Thirdly, there are the borderline
[1:01:41] Christians such as we saw in Israel come
[1:01:44] up out of Egypt. These had their names
[1:01:46] in the book of life and their works
[1:01:48] written in the books. These having
[1:01:50] failed to obey God and being void of the
[1:01:52] spirit, though even the signs and
[1:01:55] wonders were amongst them will have
[1:01:57] their names removed from the book of
[1:02:00] life. I was just staggered listening to
[1:02:04] this, thinking about this. Their names
[1:02:06] are on the book of life, the greatest
[1:02:08] place they could ever find themselves.
[1:02:11] And their names are going to be removed
[1:02:13] from
[1:02:14] it. Think about what that will be like
[1:02:16] for them to realize that, to have that
[1:02:18] moment of of recognition. Wait a second.
[1:02:21] My name was there, but it's actually
[1:02:24] removed. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:02:27] it. How will it be removed? By not
[1:02:30] following the word of the Lord. by even
[1:02:33] doing bad things to good people, by even
[1:02:37] coming against the bride of Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ. It's terrible, but it's true.
[1:02:42] Amongst this group will be the ones like
[1:02:45] Judas who betrayed Jesus, betrayed the
[1:02:49] lamb of
[1:02:50] God, the like of Judas, who though
[1:02:53] entirely void of the spirit but are
[1:02:57] religious, watch that word, religious,
[1:03:00] will have manifestation in their
[1:03:02] lives. And though on the books were not
[1:03:06] the elected in him, such also is as
[1:03:10] Balam will be in that group. Fourth, and
[1:03:12] finally, are the ones whose names have
[1:03:14] never been or will ever be written on
[1:03:18] the books. And what a sad place this is.
[1:03:22] What a terribly, terribly sad place this
[1:03:24] is. And this is where I think, brothers
[1:03:26] and sisters, we have a job to do. We've
[1:03:28] got a real solid job to do as the
[1:03:31] elected. We are the Jesus Christ to this
[1:03:34] world. Amen. All the world will see of
[1:03:37] Jesus Christ is the truly elected bride
[1:03:40] body of Jesus Christ. These people have
[1:03:43] an opportunity to do good for her. When
[1:03:46] they do good for her, they have an
[1:03:48] opportunity to inherit eternal life.
[1:03:50] Even though they weren't created to have
[1:03:52] their name on the book, and even though
[1:03:54] their name actually currently isn't on
[1:03:56] the book, we can actually do good for
[1:03:58] people and let them inherit eternal
[1:04:01] life.
[1:04:03] Sometimes getting all the money off the
[1:04:05] table in a business deal is not the
[1:04:08] right thing to do because it's after all
[1:04:12] it's not our money anyways, is it?
[1:04:15] It's all his. Amen. Alls we have to do
[1:04:18] is give him his 10%. And and whatever
[1:04:20] the offering is that he puts on our
[1:04:22] heart. But what I'm saying is trying to
[1:04:24] win at every single thing we do isn't
[1:04:27] always the right tactic. Sometimes we
[1:04:29] need to let other people win so that we
[1:04:31] know there's an opportunity for them to
[1:04:33] do good back to us or maybe to someone
[1:04:37] else who is an elected bride of Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ. We have an opportunity to
[1:04:42] actually impart eternal life in many
[1:04:45] ways. Not just saying, "Did you know
[1:04:47] that God sent a prophet? Did you know
[1:04:49] that if you come to my church, you could
[1:04:51] be saved? That we have signs and wonders
[1:04:53] in our midst that that you can actually
[1:04:54] get eternal life?" There's more to it
[1:04:56] than that, brothers and sisters. Being a
[1:04:58] good person, being a good human being
[1:05:01] can actually impart eternal life to
[1:05:04] people who never had a chance. What a
[1:05:07] tremendous thought that is. It makes me
[1:05:10] want to just go out and shake hands with
[1:05:12] as many people as I can see. Take as
[1:05:15] many people with me as possible. But we
[1:05:17] know that not everyone will be able to
[1:05:19] receive it. Or will everyone ever be
[1:05:21] able to do good? There's bad people in
[1:05:23] this world. There just is. Abel didn't
[1:05:26] do anything to Cain, did he? The only
[1:05:30] thing he did was worship different. Oh
[1:05:33] my. And when God accepted his worship
[1:05:35] but rejected Cain's, Cain couldn't
[1:05:37] handle that one. And and that's when you
[1:05:39] could see who was on the inside come
[1:05:43] out. Just add a little pressure. That's
[1:05:45] all it takes. Little bit of pressure and
[1:05:48] uh the real people come to the surface.
[1:05:51] My such are found in Revelations 13:8
[1:05:55] and Revelation 17:8. And all that dwell
[1:05:57] on the earth shall worship him whose
[1:05:59] names are not written in the book of
[1:06:01] life of the lamb slain before the
[1:06:03] foundation of the world. The beast that
[1:06:05] thou sawst and was sawst was and is not
[1:06:08] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[1:06:10] pit and go into predition. They that
[1:06:12] dwell on the earth shall wonder whose
[1:06:14] names were not written in the book of
[1:06:16] life from the foundation of the world.
[1:06:18] when they behold the beast that was and
[1:06:20] is not and yet is. Jesus said that a
[1:06:23] certain
[1:06:24] group would accept one who came in his
[1:06:27] own name, that one is the antichrist.
[1:06:30] And that is exactly what it says of them
[1:06:33] in Revelations 13:8 and 17:8. These were
[1:06:38] ordained of God, but not unto election.
[1:06:43] And with this group is such that
[1:06:46] are as
[1:06:48] Pharaoh. It says of him, even for this
[1:06:50] same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:06:54] vessels of wrath fitted to
[1:06:58] destruction. My Romans 9:17 and 22. None
[1:07:03] of these, excuse me, would be placed on
[1:07:05] the records of life. I'm not saying that
[1:07:08] there is no record of them. No doubt
[1:07:09] there is some kind of a record of them.
[1:07:12] but not in the records of
[1:07:15] life. You know, I can't help but think
[1:07:17] that's probably one of the biggest
[1:07:19] reasons why some people in this world
[1:07:23] strive to create a legacy
[1:07:26] because it's the only record there will
[1:07:28] be of their existence here, which is a
[1:07:32] really sad thing.
[1:07:36] Their purpose of existence has been
[1:07:38] dealt with slightly in the rest of this
[1:07:39] book, but we can add two more
[1:07:41] scriptures. Proverbs 16:4, "The Lord
[1:07:43] hath made the wicked for the day of
[1:07:46] evil." Job 21:30, "The wicked is
[1:07:49] reserved to the day of destruction. They
[1:07:51] shall be brought forth to the day of
[1:07:55] wrath." Now, all of that to say this,
[1:07:57] brothers and sisters, since this portion
[1:07:59] of the word is hard for the human mind
[1:08:01] to grasp, it must be accepted and
[1:08:04] believed by faith. Just like we can say,
[1:08:08] "I know that I'm saved. I know that God
[1:08:12] has saved my soul from the wrath of
[1:08:15] hell. I know that I will not have to go
[1:08:18] into the lake of fire because God saved
[1:08:21] me before the foundation of the world.
[1:08:23] How do I know? I had an experience.
[1:08:25] Something happened to me somewhere along
[1:08:27] the way and my thinking changed and my
[1:08:30] actions changed and I became a new
[1:08:32] creature in Christ Jesus. I I'm no
[1:08:34] longer the person that I used to be.
[1:08:37] Something happens to a believer when
[1:08:40] they accept the word of God. It's not
[1:08:42] just something that we say and it's not
[1:08:44] just something that we act. It's
[1:08:46] something that we live.
[1:08:49] Since this portion of the word is hard
[1:08:51] for the human mind to grasp, it must be
[1:08:53] accepted and believed by
[1:08:56] faith. Some will be offended by what I
[1:08:58] have set forth because they fail to
[1:09:00] understand the sovereignty of God which
[1:09:04] sets forth that God is God. And because
[1:09:06] he is God, one cannot defeat his
[1:09:09] councils or thwart his will and purpose.
[1:09:12] But he being omnipotent is ruling in all
[1:09:16] affairs and doing whatever he will with
[1:09:21] all his
[1:09:24] creation because
[1:09:26] all were created for his good pleasure.
[1:09:31] Brother Barry, why are you emphasizing
[1:09:33] that so much? Before the service, when I
[1:09:36] was going over this, I just couldn't
[1:09:37] help but think, yeah, Satan was all of
[1:09:41] God's creation. Satan was created by
[1:09:44] God, just like we were. Satan's not a
[1:09:46] creator, and he'll never create. The
[1:09:49] only thing he can do is pervert. That's
[1:09:51] the only tactic that he has is to
[1:09:54] pervert. But I just couldn't help but
[1:09:56] think, all were created for his good
[1:09:58] pleasure. Even Satan was created for his
[1:10:00] good pleasure so that God could actually
[1:10:03] have a tool in his tool chest. When he
[1:10:06] wants to have something happen, he's got
[1:10:08] something that will actually go and make
[1:10:10] it happen. God doesn't bring sickness
[1:10:13] upon people. God doesn't bring calamity
[1:10:15] on people. Satan allows that to happen.
[1:10:18] Satan brings that to pass. You know the
[1:10:21] story of Job? God was having a
[1:10:24] conversation. Yes.
[1:10:25] Satan turned up as usual and he said,
[1:10:30] "Where you been, Satan?" And he said,
[1:10:31] 'Well, I've been, you know, roaming to
[1:10:33] and fro in the world, checking out the
[1:10:35] governments and the people and all the
[1:10:37] different places. And he said, "Have you
[1:10:39] considered my servant Job?" And he must
[1:10:42] not have considered his servant Job. Or
[1:10:44] maybe he did, but couldn't get through
[1:10:46] to him because at one point he did say,
[1:10:48] "You got a hedge around him. If you just
[1:10:49] remove that hedge, I could get in and
[1:10:50] get him. I'll make him curse you to your
[1:10:52] face."
[1:10:53] We know the story too well. But this is
[1:10:56] the way it happens. This is the way it
[1:10:59] works. God doesn't come and bring the
[1:11:01] calamity. God told Satan in that moment,
[1:11:04] "Okay, go ahead, but don't touch his
[1:11:06] life."
[1:11:09] And and what a story when we think about
[1:11:11] calamities in our life. Job is is there
[1:11:14] and and and oh my, he gets the story of
[1:11:18] one calamity and and while they yet
[1:11:22] spoke while they're having the
[1:11:24] conversation, he's just trying to
[1:11:26] register, oh my my my children are dead.
[1:11:29] My children are are do they're dead.
[1:11:32] These are the ones that the whole the
[1:11:35] whole story of Job starts out with him
[1:11:37] making sacrifices, intercession for his
[1:11:39] children.
[1:11:42] All his children are dead while they yet
[1:11:44] spoke. Oh my, there's another calamity.
[1:11:45] And while he hears that one, he's trying
[1:11:47] to register that one. Yet another guy
[1:11:49] comes in and tells him of another one.
[1:11:52] Oh my. His children, his business, his
[1:11:54] flocks, his herds. Wow. His crops,
[1:11:58] everything gone. God never did it. Satan
[1:12:03] did
[1:12:03] it. The only thing he did was what God
[1:12:07] allowed him to do.
[1:12:09] Satan can only go as far as he has
[1:12:12] permission. Isn't that a beautiful
[1:12:14] thing? All were created for God's good
[1:12:19] pleasure. Even the devil, brothers and
[1:12:21] sisters, he's got no power other than
[1:12:24] what God gives him.
[1:12:27] My I'm going to stop reading that quote
[1:12:29] and I want to jump down. There's so much
[1:12:32] more that I did read last time from that
[1:12:34] one. You know, we talked about this
[1:12:36] about election. We're talking about
[1:12:38] election and understanding that election
[1:12:40] is the purpose for our conversation
[1:12:43] tonight for for the preaching tonight.
[1:12:45] The teaching tonight is about election
[1:12:47] and how some can be raised up created
[1:12:51] for election and some people can be
[1:12:53] raised up and created for destruction.
[1:12:56] How can that possibly be? We have
[1:12:59] already read it the punchline. We have
[1:13:01] to accept it just by faith. We cannot
[1:13:04] understand it as a human. It's
[1:13:06] impossible for us to understand as a
[1:13:08] human. You know the six times in the
[1:13:10] Bible. Romans chapter 9 verse 11, Romans
[1:13:14] 11:5, Romans 11:7, Romans 11 28, 1
[1:13:20] Thessalonians
[1:13:22] 1:4, 2 Peter 1. Our scripture tonight,
[1:13:26] wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[1:13:28] diligence to make your calling and
[1:13:31] election sure. For if you do these
[1:13:33] things, ye shall never fall. just be
[1:13:35] diligent to make sure that we're dying
[1:13:37] out to ourselves daily, checking our
[1:13:40] election, making it sure. That is the
[1:13:43] way to do it. You know, we don't do uh
[1:13:46] we don't do risky things without being
[1:13:49] sure. We don't take and get in our cars
[1:13:52] and drive down the road without being
[1:13:54] sure that all the doors are closed and
[1:13:56] that all the seat belts are clicked. We
[1:13:58] are sure that we're going to be safe.
[1:14:01] How much more ought we to be with our
[1:14:03] salvation? And I I I'm preaching to
[1:14:06] brother Barry here tonight. Election is
[1:14:08] mentioned 17 times in the exposition of
[1:14:10] the seven church ages. It's mentioned
[1:14:13] 258 times in the message of the hour. We
[1:14:17] mentioned this last week. I remember and
[1:14:19] and you know the reason that we did is
[1:14:22] it's just not a foreign concept in the
[1:14:25] Bible or the message. Election is the
[1:14:29] key component to our lives. That is
[1:14:32] where we need to live. And why I I guess
[1:14:34] maybe am I saying this? I want to try
[1:14:36] and encourage us, brothers and sisters.
[1:14:37] This was kind of a a new thing for me in
[1:14:40] my life when I recognized, you know, I I
[1:14:43] even preached it, but didn't really
[1:14:45] fully realize it. But it came to me one
[1:14:47] day. You know, when we fall, not if we
[1:14:50] fall, when we fall down, just get back
[1:14:52] up.
[1:14:54] The worst thing that we can do is live
[1:14:56] in that moment of our fall.
[1:15:00] Today,
[1:15:02] tonight, tomorrow morning, tomorrow
[1:15:05] afternoon, tomorrow night, the next
[1:15:09] morning. Staying in that fallen state,
[1:15:12] saying, you know, I did that thing and I
[1:15:14] just can't get over it. I feel so
[1:15:15] terrible. I'm a I'm a horrible human.
[1:15:22] How can I ever be forgiven by God? Uh
[1:15:24] there's no way that he'll ever forgive
[1:15:26] me for that. It's the I don't know
[1:15:30] 27,000th time that I've done that thing
[1:15:32] and thought that thing or said that
[1:15:34] thing and it just never seems to go
[1:15:36] away. I I don't know how I'm ever going
[1:15:38] to get over it. And to just continually
[1:15:40] drag that thing around just a ball and
[1:15:43] chain. You know what we're doing is
[1:15:44] we're giving credence to the devil.
[1:15:46] That's right. He's saying good. They're
[1:15:48] not praying good. They're feeling down.
[1:15:51] Good. They're depressed. Good. They're
[1:15:53] going to lash out at their spouse. Good.
[1:15:54] They're going to be rude to their
[1:15:56] children. Right on. They're having a bad
[1:15:58] day. Oh my. Now they're feeling sick in
[1:16:00] their body. We're winning.
[1:16:03] No. Just say,
[1:16:05] "Lord, I failed you once again. Please
[1:16:09] forgive me. I I just want to commit my
[1:16:12] life into your hands." You know what?
[1:16:14] David was a man after God's own heart
[1:16:16] simply because of that. because he was
[1:16:18] quick to repent. He didn't drag it
[1:16:21] around with him. And I think that's
[1:16:23] truly the elected's position. When we're
[1:16:25] quick to repent, brothers and sisters,
[1:16:27] we don't give the devil any room. He's
[1:16:29] got no room. He's coming to the place
[1:16:31] where he won't even know what to do with
[1:16:32] us.
[1:16:34] Because he just can't keep us
[1:16:36] down. You know, the sacrifice was made
[1:16:39] before the foundation of the world for
[1:16:40] us. We saw it happen at Calvary. The
[1:16:43] world's going to celebrate it. We will,
[1:16:45] too. next weekend at Easter. We
[1:16:47] recognize it. It's a tremendous holiday.
[1:16:49] It's a tremendous
[1:16:51] uh tremendous thing that
[1:16:55] happened, but it's not where it's at.
[1:16:58] The life is not at Calvary. The life is
[1:17:00] here in each and every one of
[1:17:03] us. But the sacrifice was already made
[1:17:06] and and it's up to us to identify with
[1:17:09] our sacrifice. We will never be that
[1:17:11] sacrifice. So if we're continually
[1:17:13] trying to identify with ourselves, it's
[1:17:16] never going to happen. We're never going
[1:17:17] to measure up. We'll never add up. But
[1:17:20] if we are simply just willing to take
[1:17:21] him at his word, take him at his
[1:17:24] sacrifice, make sure that we work out
[1:17:26] our own calling and election, make sure
[1:17:29] that we know where we stand. We we will
[1:17:32] never fall. It says, "Ye shall never
[1:17:34] fall."
[1:17:35] And you know, for so an entrance shall
[1:17:38] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[1:17:40] the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:17:42] Savior Jesus Christ. I know we talked
[1:17:44] about this earlier in the service saying
[1:17:45] that those brothers have passed over
[1:17:47] from this side of eternity through the
[1:17:50] portal of the word into eternal life.
[1:17:53] And so it's true. That's that's exactly
[1:17:56] right. That's what they've done. But I
[1:17:57] personally think while we're here and
[1:17:59] alive, while we are here and yet remain,
[1:18:02] there is a kingdom of God that is here
[1:18:06] for us to live in. And that entrance can
[1:18:10] be ministered unto us abundantly into
[1:18:12] the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:18:14] Savior Jesus Christ through the baptism,
[1:18:17] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. When
[1:18:21] that happens, that's where we come to
[1:18:23] the place, brothers and sisters, where
[1:18:24] the devil can't touch us.
[1:18:27] where we as believers, we're either up
[1:18:29] or we're getting up, but we're never
[1:18:31] down.
[1:18:33] That's not to say that we don't get down
[1:18:34] in our flesh, in our spirit. We do. And
[1:18:38] isn't it amazing how when we do get
[1:18:40] down, sometimes we just need a little
[1:18:42] nudge from someone to remember to pray
[1:18:44] about it.
[1:18:46] We just get caught up in our lives and
[1:18:48] in our
[1:18:49] minds. But that's the the greatest
[1:18:51] battle ever fought, isn't it? in our
[1:18:54] mind, not on the
[1:18:56] ground. You know, it's not a foreign
[1:18:59] concept election. And hopefully as we
[1:19:02] talk about these things, it will become
[1:19:04] less and less foreign and and more and
[1:19:06] more common, more and more uncommonly
[1:19:09] common to us that we could say, you
[1:19:12] know, I know that I can say I'm one of
[1:19:16] them. Romans 9 verse 20. Nay, maybe turn
[1:19:22] there with me. Romans
[1:19:26] 9:20, talking about
[1:19:28] election. How can
[1:19:30] one be
[1:19:33] made to have that entrance into the
[1:19:35] everlasting
[1:19:38] kingdom and the other one just
[1:19:41] destroyed, created to be
[1:19:46] destroyed? Romans 9:20. Nay, but oh
[1:19:50] man, who art thou that repliest against
[1:19:56] God? Shall the thing formed say to him
[1:20:00] that formed it, Why hast thou made me
[1:20:06] thus? Hath not the potter power over the
[1:20:10] clay? or the same lump to make one
[1:20:14] vessel unto honor and another unto
[1:20:19] dishonor. This is the God we're talking
[1:20:22] about. I just wanted to read those two
[1:20:25] verses. You know, it makes me think of
[1:20:27] the story brother Brandham told of how
[1:20:29] that one girl how she died.
[1:20:33] Brother Brandham prayed for her and and
[1:20:36] she was raised
[1:20:38] up, but yet she died and he went to God
[1:20:42] and said, "You owe me an answer. You owe
[1:20:44] me an explanation for her." And you
[1:20:46] know, how can anyone say that to God?
[1:20:50] And we know that he he understood very
[1:20:52] quickly that statement. How could anyone
[1:20:55] say that to God? He understood the
[1:20:56] scripture. Nobody questions God. It just
[1:20:59] doesn't happen. And uh you know, God
[1:21:02] explained it to him, and I'm not going
[1:21:04] to go too far into that, but there's
[1:21:06] times where we just have to accept God's
[1:21:09] will and say it just like Mary said, "Be
[1:21:12] it unto me according to thy
[1:21:15] will." You know, I uh just makes me
[1:21:19] think about some of the really difficult
[1:21:21] things that we've had to contend with in
[1:21:23] our life. And uh I just I I really
[1:21:27] really appreciate the elders and the
[1:21:30] ability to call upon elders. And for me,
[1:21:33] there's going to be a hole in my life
[1:21:36] because for very difficult decisions, I
[1:21:38] was uh really blessed to be able to call
[1:21:41] brother Pete Clawson. He's my
[1:21:43] grandpa, my wife's grandfather. And uh I
[1:21:46] I spent some time on the phone with him.
[1:21:49] And uh you know he told me this over and
[1:21:52] over again. He said not my will but thy
[1:21:56] will. That's what we want to seek in
[1:22:00] difficult moments. We want to have
[1:22:02] things our way. Many times and and I'm
[1:22:06] not saying that we shouldn't want it
[1:22:08] that way but more than
[1:22:10] anything as a believer I think we want
[1:22:13] to see the will of God in our lives. And
[1:22:17] uh we know brother Brandham he got to
[1:22:19] that place with the story that he was
[1:22:21] involved in. But out of the exposition
[1:22:23] of the seven church ages carrying on out
[1:22:25] of the Ephesian church age, brother
[1:22:27] Branomy says, "Now then I think there is
[1:22:29] something else you ought to know. The
[1:22:32] seven churches which are addressed by
[1:22:35] John are in Asia Minor and are all
[1:22:38] gentile churches."
[1:22:40] He does not speak to the church at
[1:22:42] Jerusalem which was mostly Jewish with
[1:22:45] perhaps just a few Gentiles in it. The
[1:22:47] reason is that God had turned from the
[1:22:48] Jews to the
[1:22:50] Gentiles. Thus the whole of the church
[1:22:52] ages is God dealing with the Gentiles
[1:22:55] and calling out a Gentile bride to
[1:22:58] himself.
[1:23:00] Isn't that a wonderful thing to think
[1:23:02] that he turned from the Jews, the the
[1:23:05] people that he chose to come to the
[1:23:08] world through and to be the Messiah,
[1:23:12] excuse me, to be the Messiah to those
[1:23:15] people he actually turned from so that
[1:23:18] he could call a bride of his own
[1:23:20] choosing.
[1:23:22] Now, this bride of his own choosing
[1:23:24] wasn't someone that he just decided now
[1:23:26] that he's here on earth, he's going to
[1:23:27] go and door knock and pass out pamphlets
[1:23:30] and maybe have some good street
[1:23:32] preachers and go through the ages and
[1:23:34] suddenly people are just going to decide
[1:23:36] that they're going to wow, they're going
[1:23:38] to accept this this thing that's
[1:23:40] happening. It's a tremendous opportunity
[1:23:42] to to hear about a good life, a better
[1:23:45] way to live. No, these are people that
[1:23:47] hear the voice of the vindicated prophet
[1:23:50] in the age in which they live in every
[1:23:52] one of the church ages. As we studied
[1:23:54] this book, we we saw it. We learned it.
[1:23:56] And and this is the people that were
[1:23:59] created before the foundation of the
[1:24:01] world. They were expressed at a certain
[1:24:04] time in a certain place, but their names
[1:24:07] were written on the book of the lamb
[1:24:09] that was slain before the foundation of
[1:24:11] the world. This wasn't something that
[1:24:14] just happened. We didn't just get our
[1:24:15] names inked on the book of life
[1:24:18] somewhere along the way because we
[1:24:20] stumbled into the mission on the corner
[1:24:21] because our parents taught us about the
[1:24:23] message of the hour. That's not the way
[1:24:24] it worked. Our names were written before
[1:24:27] there was even a speck of stardust. What
[1:24:30] a tremendous thing that is. I'm not
[1:24:32] going to read all of this quote here.
[1:24:33] There was just one little part that I
[1:24:35] wanted to talk about in here. Romans 11
[1:24:39] 1-8. I say then hath God cast away his
[1:24:43] people? God forbid. For I also am an
[1:24:46] Israelite of the seed of Abraham, the
[1:24:48] tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast
[1:24:51] away his people, which he forneew.
[1:24:54] What ye not that the scripture saith of
[1:24:57] Elias? How he maketh intercession to God
[1:25:02] against Israel, saying, Lord, they have
[1:25:04] killed thy prophets, and digg thine
[1:25:06] altars, and I am left alone, and they
[1:25:10] seek my life. But what saith the answer
[1:25:12] of God unto him? I have reserved to
[1:25:16] myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the
[1:25:19] knee to the image of Baal. Even so then
[1:25:23] at this present
[1:25:25] time also there is a remnant according
[1:25:28] to the election of grace.
[1:25:33] And that is such a wonderful little
[1:25:35] statement, that little sentence, the
[1:25:37] election of grace. That is such a
[1:25:41] tremendous thing for us. I have it
[1:25:43] highlighted. And I just think it's
[1:25:45] important to just maybe take a note of
[1:25:47] that. According to the election of grace
[1:25:50] and if by grace, then is it no more of
[1:25:54] works? Otherwise, grace is no more
[1:25:58] grace. But we know we live under a new
[1:26:01] covenant. We're living under the New
[1:26:03] Testament, the blood of the lamb. And
[1:26:06] and it's not just uh identifying with
[1:26:08] the blood and and and the bleeding of
[1:26:10] the lamb and going through all of the
[1:26:13] ritualistic technique. It's not about
[1:26:15] that at all. It's about the literal life
[1:26:17] that was in that lamb, the literal life
[1:26:19] that was in that blood, making a way for
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost to come back upon the
[1:26:24] repentant believer. But not only that,
[1:26:27] brothers and sisters, I'm studying this
[1:26:28] and this is just a little look into
[1:26:30] maybe the future. what this is when we
[1:26:32] truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:35] It's not just staying there and saying,
[1:26:37] "Oh, I'm so glad I can say that I'm one
[1:26:39] of them and I can sing and shout because
[1:26:41] I've got the Holy Ghost." It's making
[1:26:42] way for the Holy Ghost himself to
[1:26:46] manifest in that life. And unless that
[1:26:49] happens, brothers and sisters, we can
[1:26:51] say we've got the Holy Ghost all we
[1:26:52] want. We can shout all we want. We can
[1:26:54] say amen all we want. But we have got to
[1:26:57] have that literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] manifesting in this flesh. And and I
[1:27:02] say, "Lord, help me. Help me." Because I
[1:27:06] sure don't feel like it. But isn't it
[1:27:07] wonderful that the prophet said, I say,
[1:27:10] God said through the prophet, the Holy
[1:27:12] Ghost is without sensation.
[1:27:15] We don't need to feel like it. We're not
[1:27:17] supposed to feel like it. It's a totally
[1:27:19] different thing than the way the devil
[1:27:21] has taken and spun it in the rest of the
[1:27:23] world. It's such a beautiful thing, you
[1:27:26] know. I'm going to just jump down
[1:27:29] another paragraph. Romans
[1:27:31] 11:25-29. For I would not, brethren,
[1:27:34] that ye should be ignorant of this
[1:27:37] mystery. Isn't it beautiful? We should
[1:27:39] understand this. Lest ye should be wise
[1:27:42] in your own conceits, that blindness in
[1:27:45] part is happened to Israel until the
[1:27:47] fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And
[1:27:51] so all Israel shall be saved as it is
[1:27:55] written. Now remember though, I'm going
[1:27:56] to throw this out there and I know it's
[1:27:58] probably in here. All Israel is not
[1:28:00] Israel. All those people that claim to
[1:28:02] be Israel are not Israel. In fact, it
[1:28:04] even says in the church age book in the
[1:28:06] Bible, it says it as well that some are
[1:28:09] actually not just in the synagogue of
[1:28:12] Satan. They actually are the synagogue
[1:28:15] of Satan. It's a terrible thing. And so
[1:28:18] all Israel shall be saved, as it is
[1:28:20] written, there shall come out of Zion
[1:28:22] the deliverer, and shall turn away
[1:28:24] ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my
[1:28:26] covenant unto them, when I shall take
[1:28:28] away their sins. As concerning the
[1:28:30] gospel, they are enemies for your sakes,
[1:28:34] but as touching the
[1:28:36] election, they are beloved for the
[1:28:39] Father's sakes. For the gifts and
[1:28:42] calling of God are without repentance. I
[1:28:46] don't know if we talked about this last
[1:28:47] week, but I just think it's so
[1:28:49] important, brothers and sisters, the
[1:28:50] Jews. For those people, I'm sure we're
[1:28:52] all on the same page with it, but I just
[1:28:54] want to say it. Jews are not the enemies
[1:28:57] of the
[1:28:58] Gentiles. Jews are our
[1:29:02] brethren. We just read it in the
[1:29:04] scripture here. I think this is so
[1:29:05] important. And many times I've heard
[1:29:07] people say it, those Jews, they're the
[1:29:08] ones. It's their fault. And I remember
[1:29:10] thinking it as a kid as I was growing
[1:29:12] up, even as an adult when I would start
[1:29:13] to think about this, Easter would come
[1:29:14] and there'd be all kinds of Easter
[1:29:16] programs and Easter movies and you you'd
[1:29:18] see all this different stuff in the
[1:29:20] world and how people talk. And you know,
[1:29:23] the Jews are not the enemies of the
[1:29:25] Gentiles. They're our brethren. They
[1:29:27] were simply blinded so that we could be
[1:29:29] called. How humble ought we to be
[1:29:32] instead of looking at them and and
[1:29:34] thinking that they did something wrong.
[1:29:36] Even though con consider it they chose a
[1:29:40] a murderer and a robber Barabus instead
[1:29:43] of
[1:29:44] Jesus, but it was so the scripture could
[1:29:46] be fulfilled.
[1:29:48] My so that we could be here tonight. All
[1:29:50] of that had to go down. I just feel like
[1:29:52] preaching an Easter service. But that's
[1:29:56] not for me this year here.
[1:29:59] I think it's just an amazing thing that
[1:30:01] we can look at this through the lens of
[1:30:03] the message through the lens of
[1:30:05] revelation and recognize our position as
[1:30:07] being elected out of the exposition of
[1:30:09] the seven church ages and the sourian
[1:30:11] church age brother Brham says but I
[1:30:15] don't want to
[1:30:18] yeah this part's important I'm just
[1:30:21] going to jump down
[1:30:26] though like Israel
[1:30:29] They wonder if God really loves them.
[1:30:31] How can God be just and loving if he
[1:30:33] stands by and watches his people suffer?
[1:30:36] Talking about the people in the dark
[1:30:37] ages. How can he be just and and watch?
[1:30:42] How can he be just and loving if he
[1:30:43] stands by and watches his people suffer?
[1:30:46] That is what they asked in Malachi 1:es
[1:30:50] 1:3. The burden of the Lord, the burden
[1:30:53] of the word of the Lord to Israel by
[1:30:56] Malachi. I have loved you, saith the
[1:30:59] Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
[1:31:02] loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
[1:31:06] Sayaeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob, and
[1:31:09] I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and
[1:31:13] his heritage waste for the dragons of
[1:31:17] the wilderness. You see, they could not
[1:31:19] figure out God's love.
[1:31:23] I think it's so important for us to
[1:31:25] remember the the keystone revelation of
[1:31:28] the Bible. Who remembers the keystone
[1:31:30] revelation of the Bible? Just stick your
[1:31:31] hand
[1:31:33] up. We're we're in school tonight. These
[1:31:36] are these are lessons. The keystone
[1:31:38] revelation of the Bible is that God
[1:31:40] doesn't change. God doesn't change. He
[1:31:44] says it in the church age book. It's
[1:31:45] important, brothers and sisters. We
[1:31:47] change, our minds change, governments
[1:31:49] change, the the countries change,
[1:31:51] borders can change. You never know what
[1:31:54] can happen in this world. We live in in
[1:31:57] shifting sands. Anything can change in
[1:31:59] this world, but God does not change. And
[1:32:03] and we were talking about this in the
[1:32:05] Bible study this morning. I think it's
[1:32:06] so powerful, isn't it, to think that he
[1:32:08] doesn't change. Even though we make
[1:32:10] mistakes all the time, we're always
[1:32:11] changing and evolving and and falling
[1:32:13] down and getting up and having problems
[1:32:15] and issues in our lives, but he doesn't
[1:32:17] change. He's always the same person
[1:32:22] and he has this grace for us. We've been
[1:32:25] called unto elected grace. What a
[1:32:28] tremendous position that is. Goes on to
[1:32:31] say, they thought that love meant no
[1:32:32] suffering. They thought that love meant
[1:32:34] a baby with parental care. But God said
[1:32:38] that his love was elective
[1:32:42] love. Elective love. The proof of his
[1:32:46] love is
[1:32:49] election. Wow. I don't think that we can
[1:32:52] get all that there is out of this just
[1:32:55] in a conversation like this. Every time
[1:32:57] I read this and study it and and even
[1:32:59] speaking it now, I just I just think,
[1:33:01] man, that is so incredibly rich. The
[1:33:04] proof of his love is election. That no
[1:33:08] matter what happened, his love was
[1:33:12] proven truly by the fact they were
[1:33:15] chosen unto salvation. So brothers and
[1:33:18] sisters, when you fall down, when you
[1:33:21] have problems, when you feel like you've
[1:33:24] let God down, when you feel like you've
[1:33:25] let your brother down and your sister
[1:33:27] down and your husband or your wife or
[1:33:29] whoever down, read this. Read this and
[1:33:33] say this. Remember it. His love was
[1:33:37] elective love. The proof of his love is
[1:33:40] election. That no matter what happened,
[1:33:43] his love was proven truly by the fact
[1:33:45] that they were chosen under salvation.
[1:33:47] Who was chosen under
[1:33:48] salvation? Amen. We've been chosen under
[1:33:52] salvation. If we've got salvation, then
[1:33:54] we've been given elective love
[1:33:58] because God hath chosen you to salvation
[1:34:02] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:34:06] belief of the truth. So the
[1:34:09] sanctification of the spirit isn't our
[1:34:11] spirit getting sanctified.
[1:34:14] That's his sanctified spirit coming and
[1:34:16] dwelling inside of us, sanctifying us,
[1:34:19] sanitizing us, cleaning us out, getting
[1:34:22] us ready, set aside for service. Not so
[1:34:24] that we could just be filled with the
[1:34:26] Holy Ghost. So that the Holy Ghost
[1:34:28] himself could come and actually live in
[1:34:30] our lives, live in our bones, live in
[1:34:32] this bag of flesh that we've been given
[1:34:34] here where this pest house no longer has
[1:34:37] preeminence because the King of Kings
[1:34:40] and Lord of Lords is now walking around
[1:34:42] in our flesh, wearing our clothes,
[1:34:45] driving our cars, eating our food,
[1:34:48] loving our families. Goodness, what a
[1:34:51] tremendous thought that is. He may
[1:34:54] commit you to death as he did Paul. How
[1:34:57] many here tonight would be ready for
[1:35:00] that? That's a pretty serious statement.
[1:35:03] We need to be ready for that tonight,
[1:35:05] brothers and sisters. Not tomorrow or
[1:35:07] next week or next month or sometime in
[1:35:09] the future. Maybe I'll be ready for it.
[1:35:12] I just don't know. I I'm just not sure.
[1:35:15] You know what? It's God's plan and his
[1:35:16] purpose. If we have been called unto
[1:35:19] election, it's all fine. Every single
[1:35:22] thing will work out just fine.
[1:35:26] He may commit you to death as he did
[1:35:28] Paul. He may commit you to suffering as
[1:35:30] he did
[1:35:31] Job. That's his prerogative.
[1:35:37] I think I was talking about this before,
[1:35:39] talking to one of the elders about how I
[1:35:42] just had this struggle. I just had this
[1:35:43] struggle. I hate it. Whoa, man. And he
[1:35:47] said to me, "That's your struggle?" I
[1:35:49] said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'Well, what would
[1:35:51] you rather have? The devil's got one
[1:35:52] punch coming to each in individual.
[1:35:54] That's what the prophet said. Would you
[1:35:56] rather have cancer or maybe be a
[1:35:58] quadripollegic or you know what what
[1:36:01] would you rather have? Because you're
[1:36:03] going to have something. We're all going
[1:36:04] to have to suffer with something. What
[1:36:06] would we rather have? It's God's
[1:36:08] prerogative. His love is not to coddle
[1:36:10] us like a little baby, keep us all
[1:36:12] swaddled up so we just can't get hurt
[1:36:14] and nothing can happen to us. He knows
[1:36:17] exactly what's going on. He's watching
[1:36:18] over us. But it's his prerogative. He's
[1:36:22] sovereign, but it's all with a
[1:36:25] purpose. If we can see that it's all
[1:36:28] with a purpose in the midst of our
[1:36:32] trials,
[1:36:33] my if he did not have a purpose, then he
[1:36:37] would be the author and frustration
[1:36:40] of frustration and not of peace. His
[1:36:43] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:36:47] while, we would be made perfect, be
[1:36:50] established, strengthened, and settled.
[1:36:53] Isn't that wonderful? His love is
[1:36:56] elected, elective, and we have been
[1:36:59] chosen to salvation.
[1:37:02] I think this just gives us the ability,
[1:37:04] brothers and sisters, and someone's
[1:37:05] probably going to say, "It's easy for
[1:37:06] you to say, brother Barry, but it gives
[1:37:08] us the ability to forget all struggles
[1:37:10] in our minds." That's why I said, you
[1:37:12] know, when the problems come, when they
[1:37:14] do, maybe read that.
[1:37:17] Maybe just read that and think about it
[1:37:19] because it gives us the ability to
[1:37:22] recognize that we have been chosen unto
[1:37:24] salvation. We have not been chosen unto
[1:37:28] destruction. We're not that other half
[1:37:30] of the lump. The same lump of clay
[1:37:33] divided in two and one is a vessel unto
[1:37:36] honor and the other one is a vessel unto
[1:37:38] dishonor. You're not the vessel unto
[1:37:40] dishonor. Maybe once upon a time we felt
[1:37:43] like we were. But if we have the ability
[1:37:46] to receive salvation, then we have
[1:37:48] received elective love.
[1:37:52] So we have the ability to just take the
[1:37:54] struggles in our life and just put them
[1:37:55] on the back seat, put them on the back
[1:37:57] burner. They're not going to go away,
[1:37:59] but we can just push them aside and
[1:38:00] start to talk about the promise instead
[1:38:02] of the problem. And the more we talk
[1:38:04] about the promise, the smaller the
[1:38:06] problem will actually seem.
[1:38:09] But remember, brothers and sisters, his
[1:38:11] love is elective. And it doesn't make
[1:38:14] room for grace to be a disgrace. We can
[1:38:17] just do whatever we want. We can make
[1:38:19] excuses. We can make the hybrid message
[1:38:22] of the hour and and it'll work out. It
[1:38:25] it might work out. It might look like
[1:38:26] it'll work out here. We have everything
[1:38:29] looked after the way that we need it.
[1:38:31] But boy, when that time comes for us to
[1:38:33] cross over, remember that brother told
[1:38:35] brother Bradam, I don't want any problem
[1:38:36] when I get down to the river. You know,
[1:38:38] I want that token in my
[1:38:41] hand. Once upon a time, I ran a race and
[1:38:44] uh it was one leg of a a race. It was a
[1:38:48] an ultra marathon and it was at night.
[1:38:51] My leg was at night. It was 26 km
[1:38:53] through the woods and halfway through
[1:38:56] that leg of the race in the mountains,
[1:38:58] you had to cross a river and you had to
[1:39:00] get in a boat. There was a guy attendant
[1:39:02] there waiting for the runners to come.
[1:39:05] And the only way that you could get into
[1:39:06] that boat was to take the baton. The
[1:39:08] baton that they used in this relay race.
[1:39:11] It was a relay race if I didn't say
[1:39:12] that. And uh it was actually a coin. It
[1:39:16] was a coin, a token. And and this was
[1:39:19] when I was just brand new to the the
[1:39:21] message. I was two weeks before I got
[1:39:23] married. And I don't know, I just had a
[1:39:26] total transformation in my life. I was
[1:39:28] never ever going to be a runner. My
[1:39:30] brother was into this ultramarathon
[1:39:32] running stuff and and he wanted me to do
[1:39:34] it for a few years before. And I I
[1:39:37] wasn't living a life that would easily
[1:39:39] allow for anyone to be fit enough to to
[1:39:42] do that sort of thing. And anyways, once
[1:39:44] I got saved, my brother came to the
[1:39:46] place where he said, "Who are you?" And
[1:39:48] and what have you done with my brother?
[1:39:49] Because this guy is a brand new
[1:39:52] creature. You're you're you're different
[1:39:54] than anyone that I've ever talked to.
[1:39:56] And uh anyways, when I was running this
[1:39:58] race, we had to take this coin. You
[1:40:00] couldn't get in that boat to finish your
[1:40:02] leg of the race unless you had that
[1:40:04] coin. So while you're running through
[1:40:05] the woods in the dark, tripping over
[1:40:08] roots and going to different places in
[1:40:11] your mind, all of the runners throughout
[1:40:13] the day and throughout the night, they
[1:40:15] had to keep that coin. They had to make
[1:40:16] sure they had that token. And I just
[1:40:17] can't help but think, brothers and
[1:40:18] sisters, how much more do we need to
[1:40:20] make sure that we've got that token in
[1:40:22] our lives when we get to that place? We
[1:40:25] don't want to have to mess around and
[1:40:27] say, "I thought I had it in my pocket. I
[1:40:28] was sure it was right here." Oh my
[1:40:31] goodness. Just give me a second. You
[1:40:33] know, no, we need to know that. We know.
[1:40:35] We know the rich young ruler. He came
[1:40:38] face to face with the exact same word
[1:40:40] that we're talking about tonight,
[1:40:41] brothers and sisters. Many times we'll
[1:40:43] look at that story and say, "Well, that
[1:40:44] was Jesus in the days that Jesus was the
[1:40:46] Nazarene walking on on the earth in his
[1:40:49] flesh." And sure enough, it was. But he
[1:40:52] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:40:53] forever. word. In the beginning was the
[1:40:55] word and the word was made flesh and
[1:40:58] dwelt among us. And that word is the
[1:41:00] exact same word that we preach here at
[1:41:03] Calgary living word. That word is Jesus
[1:41:06] Christ himself. And that is the word
[1:41:09] that will give us that token to make it
[1:41:12] across the river when that day comes. I
[1:41:15] think it's so beautiful. So beautiful.
[1:41:18] So, I'm just going to read as much of
[1:41:19] this as I can and I'm going to pick up
[1:41:21] here when we start next Wednesday, Lord
[1:41:23] willing because I don't think we can
[1:41:25] finish this election yet. It's making me
[1:41:28] want to preach and uh I think we're just
[1:41:30] getting started here tonight, but we got
[1:41:31] to end. Goodness. As Job said, this is
[1:41:34] out of the church age book. Carrying on,
[1:41:37] he puts strength in us. Job 23:6B. You
[1:41:40] see, he himself suffered. He learned
[1:41:44] obedience by the things that he
[1:41:45] suffered. talking about Jesus, he was
[1:41:48] actually made perfect by the things that
[1:41:52] he suffered. And remember, the character
[1:41:54] that he's looking for is made where?
[1:41:56] Through the fiery trials of afflictions
[1:41:58] here. That is the gold that's tried in
[1:42:01] the fire. That gold is not gold that is
[1:42:04] in the catacombs on in uh Rome
[1:42:07] underneath uh the Vatican City. That's
[1:42:10] not the gold we're talking about. Not
[1:42:12] the purest gold that we could find here
[1:42:13] on earth on the periodic table as an
[1:42:16] element. We're not talking about that
[1:42:17] gold. We're talking about character.
[1:42:20] That is the gold. That's the things that
[1:42:22] he suffered. Hebrews 5:8-9. Though he
[1:42:26] were a son, yet he learned obedience by
[1:42:28] the things which he suffered. And being
[1:42:31] made perfect. What made him perfect?
[1:42:35] Obedience. Obedience made his
[1:42:38] perfection. And our obedience to the
[1:42:41] word of God makes our perfection because
[1:42:44] we know full obedience to the complete
[1:42:47] word of God.
[1:42:48] What titles us to the token? It gives us
[1:42:51] the ability to have that token in our
[1:42:53] lives. He learned obedience by the
[1:42:56] things which he suffered. And being made
[1:42:58] perfect, I'll just call the musicians
[1:43:00] up. Being made perfect, he became the
[1:43:02] author of eternal salvation unto all
[1:43:05] them that obey him. I say, 'Lord, help
[1:43:08] us to obey you. In plain language, the
[1:43:12] very character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:43:16] suffering. And according to Paul, he has
[1:43:19] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:43:22] that they too by their faith in God
[1:43:25] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:43:29] place of
[1:43:30] perfection. Why did he want this? James
[1:43:33] 1 2:4 My brethren, count it all joy when
[1:43:37] you fall into diverse
[1:43:39] temptations, when you come into many
[1:43:43] sufferings, knowing this, that the
[1:43:45] trying of your faith workketh workketh
[1:43:48] patience. But patience have her perfect
[1:43:51] work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
[1:43:56] wanting nothing.
[1:44:02] Boy, I'll just I'll just stop there. Why
[1:44:05] does he stand by? The reason is in
[1:44:08] Romans
[1:44:09] 8:17 to 18. Maybe stand with me as we
[1:44:12] close
[1:44:13] tonight. I'm just going to leave it
[1:44:15] right there. We'll pick up right there
[1:44:17] when we start next time. Why does he
[1:44:20] stand by? There's a reason for it and
[1:44:24] it's in his word. It's an amazing thing
[1:44:26] to just know that we have the ability to
[1:44:30] have elective love. We've given we've
[1:44:34] been given elective grace. We've been
[1:44:36] given salvation. And uh I I think that
[1:44:39] it's so beautiful because many times we
[1:44:41] can look at it and think, you know,
[1:44:43] we've been given all these wonderful
[1:44:45] great and precious promises, but yet we
[1:44:48] still have all these different
[1:44:49] sufferings while we're here and
[1:44:52] confusion and misunderstandings.
[1:44:55] But it's all under control, brothers and
[1:44:57] sisters. We just need to trust the Lord
[1:44:59] that he has it under
[1:45:01] control. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:45:04] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[1:45:06] you for your elective love. Thank you,
[1:45:09] Father, for your elective
[1:45:11] grace. Father, I pray that tonight
[1:45:14] somehow some way that perhaps someone
[1:45:18] could be encouraged by the words that
[1:45:20] were spoken to recognize if we have
[1:45:22] salvation, we have healing. If we have
[1:45:25] salvation and we have healing, we have
[1:45:28] elective love. We have the love that you
[1:45:32] had for us, Lord, according to your plan
[1:45:35] before the foundation of the world.
[1:45:37] We're not looking for it. We we don't
[1:45:39] have to go and try and find it. It comes
[1:45:42] with our salvation that you've given us.
[1:45:44] But Lord, let us not confuse the
[1:45:47] sufferings in this life with your
[1:45:49] elective love or our salvation. Father,
[1:45:53] we know that we have to suffer. We know
[1:45:55] that we have to have a character that's
[1:45:57] fit to rule and reign with you in your
[1:46:00] throne. Help us, Lord, as we go through
[1:46:02] this world, as we go through the trials,
[1:46:05] to remember this, to remember that your
[1:46:07] love is elective and that you've chosen
[1:46:09] us and nothing is out of your sight.
[1:46:11] Nothing is out of your control. It's
[1:46:13] happening because you chose it
[1:46:16] to. Father, we just love you tonight and
[1:46:19] we just want to commit each life into
[1:46:20] your hands. Father, we pray for the
[1:46:22] services while we're away. You would
[1:46:24] just strengthen and encourage our
[1:46:26] brothers. Lord, give them all both a
[1:46:28] fresh coal off the altar. Lord, inspire
[1:46:31] them, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, we pray
[1:46:34] that you would just pour out a blessing
[1:46:36] that they can't even contain. And
[1:46:38] Father, we just ask Lord that you would
[1:46:40] grant us traveling mercies on the road
[1:46:43] there and while we're there and on the
[1:46:45] road back. Father, we never take it
[1:46:47] lightly that your angels are encamped
[1:46:49] about those who fear you. Father, we
[1:46:52] love you and we thank you for all that
[1:46:54] you've doing for us tonight, Lord. All
[1:46:57] that you've done for us today and all
[1:47:00] that you will do
[1:47:01] tomorrow. We just commit each life into
[1:47:04] your hands now as we go our separate
[1:47:05] ways. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:47:09] pray.
[1:47:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:16] Jesus. Oh
[1:47:19] Jesus.
[1:47:23] Jesus.
[1:47:28] Jesus. There's just
[1:47:32] something
[1:47:34] about that
[1:47:41] name. Amen.
[1:47:45] Master,
[1:47:48] Savior
[1:47:53] Jesus, like the
[1:47:57] fragrance
[1:47:59] after the
[1:48:06] rain. Jesus.

[1:48:12] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:48:32] Kings and
[1:48:36] kingoms will
[1:48:38] all pass
[1:48:41] away. But there's
[1:48:45] something
[1:48:47] about your name. One more time. Jesus.
[1:48:53] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:49:00] Jesus.
[1:49:06] Jesus is
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] something
[1:49:11] about that day.
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:21] Master,
[1:49:24] Savior
[1:49:30] Jesus, the
[1:49:34] greatness
[1:49:36] after the
[1:49:43] rain.
[1:49:46] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:50:00] Jesus.
[1:50:07] Oh,
[1:50:09] kings and
[1:50:12] king. They will
[1:50:15] all pass away.
[1:50:19] But there's
[1:50:22] something about.
[1:50:31] Amen. Can we sing? You are my all and
[1:50:34] all.
[1:50:37] You are my all and all.
[1:50:42] You are my strength when I am weak. You
[1:50:48] are the treasure that I seek. You are my
[1:50:54] all in
[1:51:02] all. Seeking you as a preious jewel. I
[1:51:08] want the Holy Ghost
[1:51:12] too. Lord, you are my all in all.
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:25] Jesus, lamb of
[1:51:30] God, all
[1:51:33] worthy is your
[1:51:40] name.
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:45] Jesus, lamb of God.
[1:51:52] Worthy is your
[1:51:57] name. Taking my
[1:52:01] sin. Taking my sin, my cross, my shame.
[1:52:07] Rising again. Unless your name. Lord,
[1:52:12] you are my all in all.
[1:52:22] When I fall down, you lift me up. When I
[1:52:28] am dry, you feel my cup. You are my all.
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:45] Jesus lamb of
[1:52:50] God.
[1:52:52] Worthy is your
[1:53:00] name.
[1:53:05] Jesus
[1:53:06] lamb of
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:20] God. Amen. Something keeps holding me as
[1:53:24] we dismiss tonight. We know what that
[1:53:26] something is.
[1:53:31] I remember someone that used to sing
[1:53:32] this song. They would say, "Jesus keeps
[1:53:36] holding
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:39] me." We'll start with a
[1:53:43] chorus. Something keeps holding
[1:53:48] me. Every day I
[1:53:53] see he's helping me
[1:53:57] faithfully to overcome my trust.
[1:54:05] I usern.
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:36] I felt it was all that
[1:54:45] I was on the verge of giving
[1:54:54] over. The strength within
[1:54:58] myself just wasn't there.
[1:55:04] But Jesus keeps holding
[1:55:09] me. Every day I see.
[1:55:14] is helping me
[1:55:17] faithfully to
[1:55:19] overcome my
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:24] trials, guiding me
[1:55:29] constantly, giving me
[1:55:34] victory. He's our
[1:55:37] reality cuz Jesus is holding me.
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:46] Satan lay before me his
[1:55:55] temptation of his desire to steal the
[1:56:00] way my faith but he can't do it. Amen.
[1:56:05] Glory to God.
[1:56:09] found the
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:15] revelation the
[1:56:17] strength
[1:56:23] redeemer. God bless you tonight.
[1:56:30] Every day I see.

[1:56:58] reality is this holy king.
