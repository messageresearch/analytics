father into the communion that we all desire father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians if you have your Bibles today I have a couple of scriptures I'd like to read Ephesians 6 Ephesians 6:10 and I'd like to read from Zechariah Chapter 4 Ephesians 6:1 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might over in the book of Zachariah chapter 4 just start reading with verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick of all gold all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord amen who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings in Grace Grace unto it let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we love you and we thank you for your word thank you for your grace and your mercy to us now we just ask Lord Jesus that we could dip our wicks in that oil this morning Father that Lord Jesus we could trim our lamps today that father we could Lord burn bright and clear father that there would be nothing that would hinder your spirit from shining out through each and every one of us father let that let that flame burn bright and clear in every one of our Lives is our prayer this morning we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated welcome to the house of the Lord once again you know I had this on my heart for a little while the power of His might and uh I don't know what the proper terminology is for it but if if there is a a subtext I would like to to call it what house will you build him because we know that he asks what house will you build me so I just want to have it as a secondary text I guess what house will you build him certainly thankful to be in the house of the Lord today we have a few announcements we've got a a communion service coming up tonight as you can see we have the instruments at the front it's at 6 o'clock and uh we certainly trust it'll be a blessing to each one who can partake we have uh Jim night coming up Friday February the 2nd from 7 to 9:00 p.m. we have a prayer meeting February the 15th at 7:30 p.m. at the church here we have a youth event February 18th it will be at our house after the morning service in the afternoon and uh I think as usual I think as usual if that's the right thing to say if somebody needs a ride just reach out and let us know and we'll see if we can arrange that for you for their children or the youth if anyone needs a ride to it and uh so that will be um the 18th yes after the service and then the end of the month February 29th we will have the annual General men's meeting at the church at 7:30 p.m. downstairs in the basement so uh we'll have all of this on the calendar if you have any questions by all means just reach out to us are you happy this morning I got into the the thought of of zerubabel um years ago I had not really studied it out but it really kind of captured my attention and I was able to really get into it as we study in the exposition of the seven Church ages on Wednesday and uh as you know for those who are a part of it we have been into this very scripture and so I just I felt I felt compelled to go and and look this up and uh zerubabel is mentioned in the book of Chronicles in the Bible and that's where there's a lineage given that shows who zerubabel is in terms of lineage and and how he comes from David and uh on down through the the lineage of the people but he was you know in the lineage for a purpose and his purpose was to go and rebuild the Temple but for a while he had to be carried away into captivity in order for him to actually have that desire to rebuild a temple the temple had to be destroyed the temple had to become um laid to waste and and they had to be carried into captivity into uh Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar took them and we know Daniel was a part of that um we probably won't get too far into that but he was absolutely in in in need of being a part of that to create the desire in his heart and I just think it's so amazing when you look at it how we have to go through trials in our lives to really bring out the best of us to really bring out that that thing that God has placed in there from before the foundation of the world and you know for us to think that we could just step into perfection without going through trials is foolishness because Christ himself learned obedience through the things that he suffered we did not just get a free pass to go to heaven as Christians we will have to suffer just as he had to suffer now I'm not saying we're going to have to be nailed to a cross because only one was nailed to a cross even though some people try and attempt to do that as an expression for their love for Jesus and for what he went through but we're not interested in outwardly expression of works of Jesus Christ of this gospel what we want to do is actually make it an inward work to get his Spirit on the inside because we know that brother bradam he says that the works that we do are an expression of the life that's inside of us of the person for what Jesus has done for us our faith is what he gives us and our works are an expression of that faith it doesn't work the other way around we don't show our faith just by The Works that we do we live our lives according to the faith that he's given us but is uh zerubabel is mentioned in the book of Chronicles in Ezra in Nehemiah in Hagi and in Zachariah and you know just Naturally Speaking I think it's a an interesting thing that's all I'll say about it but in in in terms of natural things we can see Israel brother bradam said it and many people do say it if you want to see what time it is according to God take a look at his time piece which is actually Israel now back when Trump was President I talked about this before I found it fascinating it was back then that I actually really started to look at this um Trump was actually labeled zerubabel by Israel and why is that because he actually said we will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel he took it and actually made the consulate the US Consulate back in Jerusalem and I can't even remember where it was but what I do remember is they actually mented a coin of Trump's inscription and they put zerubabel on it and this scripture for Trump now I'm not saying he is that don't get me wrong I I I just think it's interesting that the natural world Israel those people involved with it would actually identify someone like that in this way but zerubabel is spoken of in the Bible in Cor I Les in Ezra Nehemiah Hagi and Zachariah and by the grace of God this morning I'd like to go through some of this and just talk about it I think it's a real interesting study and and where I got probably the most of my inspiration this morning is from the message of Grace and it's actually called the message of Grace in 1961 0827 in in paragraph 49 brother bradam he uh he just sort of sets a little bit of a background on it and and once we get it up I'll I'll start reading and as we read on farther we find out that God said zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone like how brother Bram talks about this he says I want you to notice he never said bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit now I just want to remind us that we're not talking about building the church as the Catholic Church which is universal or the Pentecostal Church which is denomination or the church as a as a whole we're talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ the restoration of the temple because we know that there's only one place that he will meet us there's only one place that God will meet the True Believer and that is spoken by the prophet in our day that is in Jesus Christ and there's only one way to get into Jesus Christ and that's to get Jesus Christ in you it's got to be Christ in you the hope of glory that only comes by the Holy Ghost there's only one way that we're going to get the Holy Ghost that's to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins titles won't do it titles will be uh a a faked out Affair it will be some something that we think we've done right but we won't have done right it will be wrong and we can be living under the inspiration and the Very life of the truth all the while thinking that we're right but we're wrong sincere about what we're doing but sincerely wrong while we're doing it we have to make sure that we're not actually living off of the life of another another person we have to have our own experience brother bradam says and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now it if if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church age messenger was to restore faith of the children back to their fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by organizing ation not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in in the last day amen I'm just going to pause there I think it's so important um many people will say well brother Barry we've heard this maybe for decades we've heard this we've heard this and that's good if we've heard it but are we living it that's the question what house will you build him is what I want to say today that's the inspiration for this service today brothers and sisters what house are we building him with our lives because we're building him a house if you listen to the message the Rapture brother bradam says it at the very beginning it would be really astounding if you would know what's actually taking place for me to tell you what's actually taking place at this moment he says in the Rapture message right at the very beginning and he says it further on that we're not building a wall for years and years and years hundreds of years we're building a gospel wall and and it's a straight line and and we can say it's straight we know it's straight it's plum and and we've got all the mortar and joints and everything right just right we've got all the mechanics all the stones being hued out everything it's just a great machine but then God sends a dispensational prophet to say hey guys it's time to turn a corner just like it was when Jesus came the prophet prophesied Isaiah prophesied that a virgin shall conceive right and she did how many people brother Bram says were thinking that they could be that virgin oh there was lots of virgins in those days that were probably thinking my my my my my somebody has to be that person to fulfill that scripture but then there was one person where the angel came to and that one person she didn't argue she didn't try and make it her own Doctrine she didn't make it a pet Doctrine she didn't try and make it something out of her tradition she just simply said be it unto me according to Thy word let the words of this messenger Angel come unto me and what happened was the thing that overshadowed her caused Jesus to come forward in her life and it's exactly the same way today brothers and sisters but brother bradam says in that message we're no longer building a wall we're building a house it's a three-dimensional building and it's got to be exactly according to the blueprints and if we don't have the foundation set properly tear it down right because all that can be shaken will be shaken the people who are familiar with earthquakes here if you don't have a proper Foundation under a building if there's a little bit of an earthquake that is going to fall we have to have a foundation and so when we talk about the foundation zerubabel was the one that was commissioned to go and lay the foundation for this Temple and not only lay the foundation but to finish this Temple he was commissioned by the king to come out of captivity and go and build this Temple it's a pretty amazing thing because first they were taken into captivity it was terrible their Temple was torn down destroyed and it was all according to scripture Jeremiah talks all about it he says if you don't repent from your ways if you don't repent the most religious people just repent God said it over and over and over repent repent repent just turn unto me turn from your Wicked Ways if you don't the King of the North is going to come here and destroy you and they wouldn't if you ever see the movie Jeremiah if you ever read the chapter Jeremiah you can see how they treated Jeremiah the prophet they were terrible to him and who is terrible to him just for the record religious ones exactly those those Believers in that day right they were the ones that came against him and said how dare you who are you where did you come from we know who your parents are God's got a program we just need to follow his program because it's not by Our Own Strength brothers and sisters and it's not by our might it's by his spirit that everything is going to happen it's not by a denominational organization it's not by saying that we understand with our minds the way things should be according to the message of the AR so now we're going to orchestrate everything to fit exactly the way we think it should fit it's not by our strength and it's not by our might it's by his Spirit if we have things that we want to see changed in our lives then we need to get together and be as one not pulling in every direction saying this is my way and that's his way and this is the other way brothers and sisters God's not going to move in that midst he's going to say it's confusion but when we can come together and be in one mind and one Accord get all the humanity put aside and recognize we live in this last day this Foundation has been set by the seventh Church age Messenger as we just read the foundation is set and I would say this the building is already finished but you know we all have a part to play what are we doing what house are we building them because he's not not looking at everyone and and and getting everyone to look at everyone else and say what kind of house are you building well how are you doing this and and what are you doing there no that's what the devil does he wants us to look inwardly he wants us to look in the mirror of his word and say are we lining up with his word because if we don't line up with his word then we have the opportunity to change our ways just like Jeremiah was crying out to them to repent just turn from your evil ways I'm not saying everyone's evil here don't get me wrong what I am saying is that we need to make sure we understand that we're building the Temple for the Holy Ghost and it ain't a building it's our lives it's our families it's our marriages it's our relationships they all demonstrate what's going on because all of that is actually the fruit that's in the branch as we've talked about on Wednesday you know the hybrid tree the grafted in tree the tree that's all grafted in brother bradam talks about the orange tree if that tree ever puts forth another Branch it will only put forth oranges but all the other branches are grafted in people come in with different ideas different traditions and they get plugged in and they're just grafted in and what happens is they live off the same life everyone's living off the same life it's the same Holy Ghost and you know what they produce fruit yes sir but what fruit is it is it the fruit of the spirit because that's what brother Bam's talking about when he says if that Branch ever puts forth another Branch if that tree ever puts forth another Branch then it will be just exactly the same as the beginning and he said that it was an orange tree from the beginning and I'm not saying that the fruit of the spirit is an orange don't get me wrong what I am saying is that the fruit of the spirit is in the word and we have a very specific detailed program of what that fruit looks like excuse me and it's not a bunch of different fruits to say that I can just have you know a little bit of joy and a little bit of longsuffering and and a little bit of peace and everything is fine I've got the fruit of the spirit you got a portion of it but we're not talking about a portion here in this day we're talking about the entire word having all of it but it only comes one way and that's by the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my Spirit saith the Lord not by organization and not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last day brother BR goes on to say zerubabel the prince with josua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he had took the people back to the foundation in type which we all know know that these candlesticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the Bible said here and the Olive Branch we are the wild branch that was grafted into the root of the tamed Olive Tree Gentiles and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give light to the seven Church ages I love how brother Bram just brings this right into the church ages how he ties it right in here so we can see that there's a connection to it it's not just talking about something out of the Old Testament an Old Testament scripture where we have to wonder how how does this even tie together so I wanted to talk about this the rubba bell and we will but I just wanted to pause here for a minute and talk about the headstone we know that uh yes verse 7 of Zechariah 4 who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain isn't it interesting to look at that brothers and sisters how many times do we have a mountain in front of us and you know what if you have the spirit of God in your life and you are living by that scripture where it's not by strength and it's not by might but it's by my spirit saith the Lord who is that mountain that stands before you because it's going to turn into a plane brothers and sisters but only if you're living that way and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so I found this interesting headstone all of this is kind of mysterious so I looked at it headstone in in in the Strong's concordat it's h 7222 and and it's it's it's yeah I'm not even going to try to pronounce it Raha and oh by pronunciation it's rosha the definition is it is feminine The Headstone is feminine and it's the headstone from this scripture that I searched in in Strong's Concordance so it's the actual word in this scripture it's not just headstone in general in the Bible but it's from this scripture and it says the definition is feminine of H7 218 the head The Headstone a feminine headstone though isn't that interesting so H 7218 I know this can seem like a an eye Crossing thing when you start to go into the root words and stuff but sometimes I think it's important to look at so we're talking about the feminine headstone here a and the root it's the root of this word here Hebrew is the translation is ro ro roshi is the actual pronunciation but the definition is from an unused root apparently meaning to shake the head as most easily shaken whether literally or figuratively so a feminine head that's being shaken either literally or figuratively how many times can we shake our head and cry Grace Grace unto it but here we have zerubabel setting this headstone this foundation stone not the Cornerstone but the headstone he's setting this Stone in in the foundation of this Temple and we know that he is it's said that he's going to cry Grace Grace unto it h I just can't help but think brothers and sisters there is a people and there is a place where there is a headstone that is a feminine that is the foundation of the church that is by his spirit that can only cry Grace Grace unto that headstone and that's what we heard this morning you know that just that just does it for me when I see a song Maybe people think I'm just stretching it here but you know when you prepare and you come and and you wonder is this the direction to go when we can say that the tomb is empty and that stone is rolled away I just can't help but think it's the same thing as the rubber bell saying that you know that stone has moved and it is cried Grace Grace unto it amen you know I want to read out of Hagi chapter 1 uh this morning if you have your Bibles maybe a little bit of a bible study this morning but just to look at the at the at the story here a little bit about zerubabel and and and how zerubabel was used for this restoration of the temple hegi chapter 1 verse 1 and remember we're paralleling this as we go what house are you building him amen what will you build him in the second year this is Hagi 1 verse one in the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord to Hagi the prophet unto zerubabel the son of shiti Tiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this PE this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of God by Hagi the prophet saying is it time for you oh for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways brothers and sisters I just feel so impressed to to say it this morning we we we we want to see the temple being built but I believe this speaks to something in our day where we can say you know what someday that Temple is going to be built somewhere and we'll do exactly what brother brandham says we'll take and put the coming of the Lord somewhere out there we'll put what's actually taking place somewhere in the future or or we'll look back and say you know he's Jesus Christ of the past or or make him Jesus of the future and ignore what he's doing right now what he's doing right now is building a three-dimensional Temple and it's not the Temple of the building that we're looking at here it's not the Temple of a denomination or the Temple of an organization it's the Temple of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of the Believers that's what he's doing and what are we doing with our lives brothers and sisters what are we doing with our temples I want to say this I I I just it hit me on the way to church this morning and I I'm preaching to myself right along the way here brothers and sisters but what we do with our temples what do we do with our temples when we leave church when we're at church we're Christians and when we leave here we should still be Christians and when we get into our private places and do our private things we should still be Christians but I want to ask the question this morning if we consider this to be a temple of worship and and our bodies to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost as Paul said could we bring our private lives into this building and do what we do in our private lives right here or would we say oh my I wouldn't want to do that you know brothers and sisters there's things in my life where I would say whoa I wouldn't want to do that I wouldn't want to make this building like that I would not want to do that but what would make me think that I could do it anywhere else and it wouldn't make a difference because this building doesn't hold the Holy Ghost your life does our lives hold the Holy Ghost we take the Holy Ghost he created a spot in the heart of every single believer for himself and he's not interested in sharing with anyone anything my so thinking about this this scripture here I'll just start from the beginning and not start preaching again here in the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the Lord to hegi the prophet unto zerubabel the son of shtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time to build the house should be the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord to Hagi the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat and ye have not enough ye drink and ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earnthenecklace working it's just not happening maybe we're considering this message of the hour and we just can't live it you can't live it no one can live it the only way you're going to do it is by his Spirit am because this scripture is not just an Old Testament scripture not by strength nor by might but by my spirit saith the Lord that's the only way you're going to live this gospel it's the only way we're going to consecrate these temples is by his spirit and when we have his spirit it he's going to draw our attention to the things that defile this Temple he's going to say stop doing that I don't like that and we're going to have the opportunity to say okay or say no I can handle it I can actually step over this red flag I've done it for the last 10 years and it's just fine it doesn't matter look at me everything is good in my life is it spiritually good in your life I want to say consider our ways our ways I don't want to say consider your ways I want to say consider our ways let me consider my ways brothers and sisters he says go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house get busy do some work go get some wood obviously this is the natural this is the the natural go up to the mountain how many people here know what it means to go up to a mountain it takes work you don't just go up the mountain with ease one day we're going to travel like a thought but for those people who hike you know what it means to go up a mountain and then get wood my goodness that means you're going to be carrying an axe you're going to be carrying a saw you're going to be carrying ropes maybe a sled or a wagon you're going to take some effort and put it into this it's going to take some effort to put into this Temple that we have here we're not just going to have this Temple and say I was just born into the message of the hour so everything is great in my life you know what I've discovered brothers and sisters is those people who are born into the message of the hour they seem to have a greater struggle than the people who actually come in off the street because they can't really see a defining time or moment when that Holy Spirit comes into their lives and I'm not here to tell you one way or the other that it should be a lightning bolt experience or it should be just a blended Affair I'm not here to tell you that I just want to say get the Holy Ghost that's all and when you get it you know it brother bradam says it's just like having a baby you don't just have a baby and forget you had a baby all those sisters here that have had children you know what I mean it doesn't just happen and then you forget wow I forgot that I had a child doesn't happen but go up to the mountain and bring wood get busy do something about it and build the house he says amen and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified sayith the Lord sometimes in our lives we can try and make him glorified with our natural lives I got a business and I work hard he's not glorified in that brothers and sisters that's not his glory his glory is in this Temple he wants to see us build this Temple he wants to see us push aside all of our carnality all of our nonsense in our lives and get busy building the Temple of the Holy Ghost that's what he wants to see and then he will be glorified then he will take pleasure in it and I'll say this then he'll take pleasure in everything else in our lives and then he'll glorify himself in everything else in our lives if you want to see the Lord move in your life put him first and see if he doesn't bless every single area of your life go up to the mountain bring wood and build the house and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified sayith the Lord not you many times we could say wow look what I've done I've got all these trophies and accolades and things it's all for not it's all going to burn it's all a waste of time if we don't have him first in our lives verse 9 says ye looked for much and low it came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why sayith the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man into unto his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed from her fruit and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the cornn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that brothers and sisters we know this is this is serious if we're not willing to put God first then he will blow on our lives and he'll cause a drought to happen and as Sons and Daughters we'll go so far and then we'll begin to cry out because we can't stand it any longer it will drive us nuts we won't sleep we won't eat we won't be able to work it will make us mad in our heads we will have a desire to serve God we will cry out to God he will have his way in our lives he says and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil we know the corn is a type of food it's being able to actually partake of the food and and get fat inside our lives and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation and the oil is the spirit that comes along with that and we know the oil it causes a stimulation but here he says that you know what if you're not going to put me first you're going to have a lot of troubles you're going to have a lot of struggles in your life and you're going to wonder why you're going to ask why and I'm going to tell you it's because you haven't considered your ways you haven't really realized who deserves to be first in your life but when you decide that time will come if you're a son and daughter of God when you decide to put me first then you'll see fruit you will actually have corn you will have that wine and that oil in your life it will be there it won't stay that way forever I just think it's so rich this this study about zerubabel in ha Hagi chapter 2 verse 1 in the seventh month in the 1 and 20th day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet Hagi saying speak now to zerubabel the son of shaltiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory just going to pause there for a second because I think it's beautiful it kind of ties That headstone together because it doesn't say its Glory doesn't say his glory it says her glory we know the church is always represented as feminine he's the masculine she's the feminine who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your your eyes in comparison of it as nothing yet now be strong o zerubabel saith the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of josec the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land sayeth the Lord and work don't just wait for God to just let it flow down from the mountain because it's not gonna we've got to work we got to put our shoulders to the wheel we got to be willing to come to prayer meeting we got to be willing to come to service we got to be willing to come to communion we got to be willing to take God at his word brothers and sisters to see him move in our lives otherwise we're just going to be saying oh God just rain down your blessings on me I believe the message of the hour and it's not going to happen verse 5 according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so it goes all the way back all the way back to all those people that actually were in bondage for 430 years 440 years they were overtime in bondage and then they started to cry out and when they started to cry out God heard their cries didn't he brothers and sisters I can only think that they started working not just for not just for fa but they started to work for the Lord they started to actually think there's got to be another way there's got to be a better way there's a promise where's our promise and I just can't help but think as Sons and Daughters of the most high God we have got to be willing to cry out for that promise in our lives but we know he'll come verse 5 according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts now this is important I think the silver is mine and the gold is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter host shall be greater than the former am saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts brothers and sisters don't look at this as a as a zerubabel and if that's a word even uh Old Testament Temple even though it is look at it today as the Temple of the Holy Ghost Don't Be Afraid just March forward amen just trust in the Lord let it be his strength his might his power that does it it's only going to come by his Spirit but to think of these temples and how glorious they must have been even the second temple that was done by zerubabel and we know that he was commissioned to go and build this Temple we might have time to get into that today I don't know but he was commissioned by the king to go and build this Temple the one who actually had him in in in captivity there came a time where they were released by The King to go back and were funded by the king to go back and actually build this Temple go and restore this Temple and it's amazing because Daniel is one of the key figures that actually allowed for this to happen and Daniel didn't even get to go back and see it but we have zerubabel here he is this one that went with Nehemiah and all the others to go and actually see this Temple restored and that Glory of that Temple must have been something I can only imagine it would be something to see not not that it would be maybe as fantastic as Solomon's but if you consider all of the oppression and all of the struggle that they must have went through all of the work that they must have done to restore this Temple what that Glory must have been like and you know brothers and sisters for those people who are around anyone who has ever experienced it before when we got this building and we renovated this building there was a lot of work that went into it there was a lot of people putting their shoulder to the wheel to make this building right here in Calgary operational for the for the services that we now have I can only imagine what that Temple must have been like but to think it was restored and the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saeth the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts now what place brothers and sisters not this building in Calgary not that Temple there you am me we've been talking about it on Wednesdays the Sabbath rest there is a rest but it's behind the inner Veil and we've got to be willing to go in behind that inner Veil the only way we're going to ever be able to go in behind that inner Veil if you know the word of God if you know God to be a living God you're not going to just walk in behind that inner Veil because we know that means certain death as a human but if you get his Spirit on the inside to stay out means death and we know once upon a time back in the Garden of Eden there was cherubims that were set with a flaming sword keeping every single way to the tree of life and that was to stop man from being able to just have eternal life because man was promised the soon as soon as you disobey my word as soon as you step out from behind my word is the day you will die and we know that that's what happened he knew what was going on he stepped out and that was what stopped man from being able to get to the tree of life so God put those flaming swords in front of it but now after Calvary we know those flaming swords were pulled away and to actually resist going into that means death now once upon a time to go and put ourselves in front of those flaming swords it meant death now to to to resist it to not do it it means death and we know we could say it this way to resist the baptism of the Holy Spirit to say I whatever whatever you want to say about it to resist the baptism of the Holy Spirit to resist the spirit of Jesus Christ to resist actually getting our temples completely ready is to accept the mark of the beast because these bodies these temples are already marked with the mark of the beast unless you are a son and daughter of God and if you are a son and daughter of God then you will come completely in line with this word there's no way that you will not receive the message of the hour for your day if you're a son and daughter of God the glory of this latter house these bodies these temples shall be greater than the former saith the Lord of hosts and you know we've talked about it you've heard it many times the prophets say it many other ministers I'm sure say it when we get over there to the other side we're going to say Noah what was it like to beat on the wood all those years and only have eight Souls get in the boat Nehemiah what was it like to go back and rebuild the Temple Solomon what was it it like to have all that knowledge all these people Saul what was it like to be the first king of Israel we're going to ask all these people we're going to desire it they're going to say no no no no no no no forget about all that what about you how did you overcome with a lid of Hell being taken off in your age and thousands times thousands of devils chasing you down day and night there is a rest for you brothers and sisters there's a rest for us if we're willing to accept accept it the way that God's given it to us but if we choose to actually try and do it our way then he has to fold his hands and say I don't know what to tell you I'm probably just going to blow on your house on your temple on your on your life I'm going to blow on it and just cause a little bit of a Dro a little bit of a time where you're going to have a little bit of a struggle there's going to be a little bit of a problem and and when you're ready you're going to come back and you're going to say restore unto me Lord all my goodness he knows exactly what we need the message of Grace in 1961 brother bradam I I think it's just this such a good message brothers and sisters they all are I know butth this one here is just what's really doing it for me as of late in paragraph 46 he says then I chose this morning being that being that that message was so attacked another thing that I'm so gotten after about is preaching Grace wow I want to speak on that this morning as I read the fourth chapter of Zechariah a portion of it I just think that's so beautiful brothers and sisters and I want you to know my heart it's not to cre to preach condemnation it's not to preach destruction it's not to preach a a a famine in the land it's to preach Grace we've been given an Open Door we've been given the full book full complete access Hallelujah to the full mind of God and all we have to do is step forward we have to be willing to take the steps to do it though and I just will say it again our lives we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost we'll get to that scripture it's coming we're going to bring it into the New Testament here if we have time um but you know how we have this Temple be in the Holy Ghost it's not this building would we bring our private lives into this building I don't know some people they might want to actually put the hockey game up here and play the hockey game is that going to please the Holy Ghost some people might want World Cup soccer some people might want YouTube now I'm going to really pinch a little bit but some people might want video games and I'm going to say this if we're going to put video games up on the screen what kind of video games are they are there any that please the Holy Ghost now we could say well there's some that you know some video games are just good video games and they teach us good things what's the inspiration behind them who are the people that created those video games are they people Anointed with the Holy Ghost are they people that are true Christian Believers in our day are they the ones that are creating these video games that we're actually feeding our minds on feeding and feeding and feeding because if they are then I would say Amen they'll have scriptures in them they'll probably have message in it and it'll be good it'll be edifying to the body but if it's not brothers and sisters what's it doing to you is it consecrating your temple right what else do we look at on the internet would we want to bring that up on the screens here would we be comfortable if we knew that this is what brother so and so this is his thing this is what he likes to watch this is what sister so and so does in her time this is what we do as a body of Believers if we can't do that in this building then why on Earth do we do it and call ourselves message Believers brothers and sisters this is the consecration that God's looking for he ain't looking for people that are busy slopping around like brother bradam says in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ kissing and slopping with all the Hollywood stuff that's going on and then claiming to be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen yes that's a lie of the devil what's the inspiration behind whatever it is we're into I know I pinched on video games but what is it what what are we into what do we do with our time outside of this building is it edifying to your body to your temple do you believe that scripture that you really are that we really are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen and as I'm saying this I'm saying it to me brothers and sisters do I believe that I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost well if I am then I want to say this God's calling me to a greater Consecration and I know God's calling you to a greater consecration because we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so maybe in 2024 Brothers and Sisters Let's push aside all the nonsense and just get into Christ and I can't help but think in my own life in my own experience I know that I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you know it when you know it but there's times where we get sidetracked and he just brother bradam says it just like a dove he'll just go and set up on a a branch and just wait until we actually get things straightened out what if we didn't have to wait till we get things straightened out brothers and sisters there's times in our life where we need to be able to speak the word and if we're not ready if we're like brother bradam remember the story where brother bradam was there and he had the tax case and we know the tax lawyer whatever was calling and I think it was his wife or his daughter that answered the phone and and and and said you know is is William brandom there and he was there and he knew who it was on the phone and he said I'm not here and he stepped outside remember that that story he knew that he couldn't go and pray for anyone because he lied that's true don't think that that's exclusive just because he was a prophet in the prophet's office that that changed things for him and God that's the way it is for every son and daughter of God you know that it says that there will be no place in the Kingdom of Heaven for liars amen and it doesn't say big hairy black lies or little microscopic teeny white ones which one's a lie we need to know where we stand brothers and sisters this is no joke this is no time you know what the devil is roaming about as a roaring line seeking who he may devour and he just loves to eat children now I'm not saying not to scare the children I'm saying it really to scare the parents because you're the Holy Ghost for your children until the day of accountability so where do we stand do we just let our children go and do whatever yeah that's fine just do whatever you want you know one of the biggest problems that we face today is screens let's just call it out brothers and sisters they're of the devil there's a reason why there's screens in everybody's pocket in everybody's hand is so that they can have a pipeline to the devil to the tree of knowledge of good good and evil instead of the tree of life right if you think about it you can say well I've got the screen and I've got the message on it you know that if you look at the app I wonder if we could do this someone might be smart enough to do it what percentage of the entire internet pipeline of information would the message of the hour be what percentage of that would it be do we really need screens some people will have the tablet where they will just say it's connected to Jeffersonville and you know I don't want to get into that either but you know what if we have a screen what are we doing with it that's what I want to say what are we doing with it if we got a screen we need to be very very very careful with our screens especially when it comes to our children Ezra chapter 5 Ezra chapter [Music] 5 what house are you building them Ezra chapter 5 start reading with ver verse two then rose up zerubabel the son of Shel Tiel and jesua the son of josec and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them at the same time came to them Tatai governor on this side of the river oh my and sherar Bai and their Companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall I just think it's a beautiful thing here I'm just going to pause there bear with me for a second oh my I'm just going to do this this way I think it's interesting when we look at this here how we have oh I can do it this way bear with me for a second there we go then rose up zerubabel the son of Shel jesua the son of josac and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them at the same time came them Tatai governor on this side the river and sherar bosai and their Companions and said thus and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building my they're really taken note they're really trying to dig in to see what's going on here but the eye of their God was upon the Elders of the Jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to Darius right and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter the copy of the letter that Tatai the governor on this side the river and shethar bosai and his companions the aites which were on this side the river sent unto Darius the king they sent a letter unto him whereon was written thus unto Darius the king all peace be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is builded with great stones and Timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls we asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were chief of them and thus they returned us answer saying we are the Servants of the god God Of Heaven and Earth and build a house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of Israel builded and set up but after that our fathers had provoked the god of Heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the chaldon who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon but in the first year of of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the Temple of Babylon those did Cyrus the king take out of the Temple of Babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was Shish Bazar whom he had made governor and said unto him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be build it in this place then came the same Shish Bazar and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet is not finished now therefore if it seem good to the king Let There Be search made in the king's Treasure House which is there at Babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure concerning this matter bear with me for one second here I think it's beautiful this scripture to recognize we have Shish Bazar building this Temple and while he's there under the commission of the king he gets naysayers he gets people who want to come and question him about his motive and about his objective and say to him what on Earth are you doing here why are you doing this who gives you the authority to do this I can't help but think it's a little bit like brother bradam heard who gave you the authority to heal John Ryan and he said straight out it was Jesus Christ it was the Lord Jesus Christ but here we have these guys trying to give them trouble and say why do you think you can build this who gives you authority to do this and they say you know what we're not even going to give you our names no you got to give us your names we're taking names and phone numbers and we're going to the king with this because you're not authorized but they had a greater King's authorization and you know brothers and sisters even while they were laid waste that Temple was laid waste they were taken away into captivity because of their misbehavior God restored them back to the same condition and he not only restored them back to go build that Temple he gave them everything that they needed to do it so brothers and sisters you can draw the parallels to today as we go if we've gone Wayward if we've had times in our life where we've had the Lord blow on our life because of misbehavior it's not too late he's still calling and if we're willing to just get in line with his word he will bless us with all of the blessings that we need he'll give us all of the stuff that we need to bring proper worship unto him he doesn't want to leave us out to pasture he doesn't want to see us going the wrong way he wants us to worship Him the the right way amen and we need to recognize that this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost Zachariah four Grace Grace unto it The Headstone the feminine then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel and just for the record that that that name uh sh I can't remember shajar that is the I think it's the Persian name for zerubabel it's the same person I meant to say that earlier then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou great Mountain before zerubabel that shall become a plane and I want to say who is that mountain before you today brothers and sisters that shall become a plane whatever it is that's in front of you it shall become a plane and he shalling bring forth The Headstone the feminine the feminine thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when we truly catch this revelation of Jesus Christ that this headstone is the feminine it is the church we've been given the opportunity to come and worship Him freely in spirit and in truth all the way that he desires if we're willing to consecrate Our Lives we have the ability to cry Grace Grace unto it we recognize it there's nothing going to hold us back I just heard brother bradam say it again yesterday I thought it was so good you know guy talks about how he gets a shiver oh my there's someone always saying amen so loud in a service and and he says you know what if you get a shiver here you're going to freeze to death up there right because if you think this is loud it ain't nothing compared to the sound that's going to be made up there and you know what it's loud down there as well so you might as well just get used to just giving God glory brothers and sisters cry and Grace Grace unto him for what he's done for us this is the quietest place we're ever going to be imagine that all Heaven is going to stop to listen to the redeemed worship those people that recognize there ain't nothing I ever done he just chose me in him before the foundation of the world and one day I just had the ability to recognize it I could see that that it was my name that was written in that book that John when he wept greatly because no man was worthy to take that book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne in heaven or in Earth or under the Earth no man was worthy oh my but then he saw a bloody lamb step forward and take that book and John was weeping because he recognized that Redemption was there that everybody who ever would be saved was in that book at that moment verse eight says moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel hath laid the foundation of this house and His Hands shall shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you now brothers and sisters maybe I'll get a little sacrilege this morning just in the last 10 minutes here but I can't help but think that you know in this day and age we have had as a rubel lay the foundation for us and and you know what there's hands that are finishing this Temple we have had a prophet in our day come and lay this foundation for us so that we can go forwards and you know brother Bram says it in the message of the hour he says that you know there's things that aren't completely explained and it's going to take you ministers to go and explain it to dig a little deeper and go further with it but this message is a message of Grace this is not a message of legalism a message of legalistic behavior to look down our nose at anybody else our brothers our sisters Sinners on the street the only reason we're not Sinners on the street is because of Grace because of his grace how easy is it to worship brothers and sisters when we re recognize his grace this message is of Grace it's not of disgrace it's not of saying I can just do whatever I want either because I know that I'm going to be saved because of predestination from before the foundation of the world I could just do whatever I want to do no you can't and you know what you'll do if you have his Spirit you'll do exactly what the word of God tells us to do that's what we will do that will be our Behavior we'll be able to live our private lives right here in this building and not have any fear that's right I say Lord help me I like to do Woodworking and it would get messy in here but you know brothers and sisters I've looked at things on screens I've heard music I'm not going to pretend to be innocent here I'm a human being just like everyone else but I want to consecrate my life so it is acceptable in his sight don't you today this is going home time this is going to take more faith than any other age rapturing faith is what we're after the only way that we're going to get to it is to get busy is he building build that Temple Amen brother bradam in the message of Grace in paragraph 53 says now remember in our teaching on the lessons that we've just been through that we took the Great Pyramid and studied that for a while that Enoch must have built and The Headstone was never put on the pyramid I've been there the architecture of it could never be replaced till this day we have no machines that could build a pyramid no powers less the atomic power that could build a pyramid because it's too gigantic stones that would weigh tons and tons and tons stands way in the air so put together that even a thin razor blade could not and they're not cemented they're just cut so they'll Join one with another and that's the way the body of Christ should be so cut by the Holy Spirit by God's Great instrument and tool that we'd be joined as one person we're not divided we should be one person and it goes to show that no Machinery can do that way it takes God to do that no mechanics of organization no lodges none of these things can ever do it as good as their intentions are my sometimes we've got real good intentions we know the bylaws we we know that what brother Bram said we've got all our quotes for our side of the table in our argument we we know all of it right what is it brothers and sisters is it his Spirit or is it our spirit right we should be one person and it goes to show that no Machinery can do that way it takes God to do that no mechanics of organization no lodges none of these things can ever do it as good as their intentions are they can never do it because it takes God to do this the Holy Spirit to build this Temple it takes his holy spirit to do this brothers and sisters that's the only way it will ever happen you know turn with me over to the book of Acts we've still got six minutes here I really don't want to keep us long because we've got service tonight I really don't want to keep us late tonight because I know we have young children that have school what a wonderful time it is to get together and just have a communion service Acts chapter 7 what else what house will you build them we know this is the story of stepen preached to him a good one preach to him a Zinger preached a sermon that pierced the heart of the most religious people in their day and at the end of it he says but s verse 47 sorry of Acts chapter 7 verse 47 of Acts chapter 7 but Solomon built him and house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest he's not interested in a building we know that after Calvary that was over and he proved it by making the very first order of his business to go from the cross into the temple and to tear that that Veil where it held people out for centuries people were held out from going behind that inner Veil only the the high priest could do it and what did he do his first order of business was to rip that Veil from top to bottom to say it is no longer going to be religion you are no long longer going to build a temple and actually offer sacrifices because I am the sacrifice I am the one that was torn so that you can come in and actually be Sanctified now because you are the temple it is not God going to build a building anymore no more Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest he is not looking for a building he's looking for hearts in sons and Daughters of God surrendered hearts of Sons and Daughters of God consecrated hearts of Sons and Daughters of God and you know brothers and sisters when we get to that place when we do that when we take the extra effort and build that Temple this Temple clean it out consecrate it when we take that effort to build it like we said going to the mountain to heue down the wood to come back to build the temple we've got to do the work we got to come to church that's our mountain to climb the devil don't want us to come to church we got to come to church on Wednesday night the devil don't want us to come to church come to church and cut down some trees on Wednesday night brothers and sisters and see if God won't bless you see if he won't give you all the instruments of worship that you need my goodness he will give you all the gold and silver that you need because it's all his we read it earlier Corinthians 6 1 Corinthians 6 let's turn there quickly in the last couple minutes I'll call the musicians just to prove I'm closing 1 Corinthians 6 very familiar scripture here 1 Corinthians 6: 19 now this is really where I want to get to and maybe we'll get into it at a later date because we're out of time 1 Corinthians 6 what know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods don't think that our our spiritual walk is simply at church and then we can just get into the world and then we can just do whatever we want with our lives brothers and sisters no no no no no no no no what happens is we wind up leaving Christ right here which is terrible who wants to leave Christ right here I don't think anybody does if we're willing to take a look at this I would recommend going and reading it maybe later this is speaking about something very specific it's speaking about fornication specifically speaking of natural and spiritual fornication Paul Jesus Christ to the church through the Apostle for the first age bringing this message to the church very specifically and you know it's good to go back and read maybe the the verses before and afterwards just to see what it says 1 Corinthians 6:13 it says Meats for the belly and belly for the meats the natural things are the natural things brothers and sisters they're there Meats for the belly and belly for the meats but God shall destroy both it and them this flesh is not going to inherit eternal life right every one of our bodies is going to perish we've got scars in our Spirits we've got scars in our flesh all of it's going to perish the only thing that's going to live is our soul if we have that Holy Ghost seal of God in our lives and you know if we have it then we don't have to worry goes on to say but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his own power not by strength nor by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord he'll do the work brothers and sisters if we're willing to surrender to him you know looking at this Greek word it's just I thought so good to go and look at it 4202 this word fornication just to just to look at it and see really where it's at and you know what the uh the word is the pronunciation is is pora sound familiar pora the definition is from from G 4203 it's harlotry including adultery and incest figuratively idolatry fornication that kind of surprised me the other one the 4203 is is porn porn Yu the ACT to act the Harlot that is literally indulge unlawful lust of either sex or figuratively practice idolatry to commit fornication I understood this for the longest time that this was the unclean act between human beings but isn't it interesting to say this the the the definition is actually idolatry also it's right there hand to glove so brothers and sisters if we put anything before Christ remember what the prophet said if we put anything before Christ that's idolatry if we put our job if we put our family if we put our church if we put our careers if we put our education whatever it is if we put it before Christ that's idolatry and that's the same sin as fornication I think it's incredible to look at that you know when we're talking about this rest there is a rest brothers and sisters but it's behind that inner Veil and that inner Veil Now isn't in a temple built with hands it's actually in the hearts of the Believers and it's not a day and it's not a place it's not some form of work that we can do it's us ceasing and God doing but we've got to be willing to do the work to build that Temple to find that rest and if we do if we're willing to brothers and sisters he'll give us that rest he'll actually come and abide with us we know the word says that he stands at the door knocking to see if he can come in and we know brother brandham said this is the only church he said through the Prophet this is the only church that ever he stood on the outside knocking to get in if we're willing to open the door and invite him in what does the word say He he'll come in and he'll Su with us that means that he will feed us he'll stay with us he'll encourage us maybe stand with me as we close today there is a place brothers and sisters where we can have that rest where we don't have to worry about anything in our lives come what may we know God's in control we just give him that opportunity amen hallu we cry out your [Music] name father of Life Seated on your throne of grace it's only by your mercy we are [Music] saved Lord you have said
