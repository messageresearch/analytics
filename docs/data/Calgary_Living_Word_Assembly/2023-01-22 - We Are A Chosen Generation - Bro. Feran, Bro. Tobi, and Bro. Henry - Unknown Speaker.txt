Lyrics
The Bride of Christ is returning
Back to the Word,
As it was in the beginning
Before the fall of man.
We're a people that's peculiar,
Believers with a Message;
Christ has called us out from bondage,
Reunited with Him.

Chorus

We are a Chosen Generation,
We are Elected Seed of God,
Predestinated by foreknowledge
We are heirs of a new home;
And by the Life that's in the Blood,
We're given entrance to the throne.
Yes, we're children of Almighty God,
He takes care of His own.

Now we've been privileged
To go within the veil
With this revealed Word of the hour;
Without Its anchor and Its Token
There'll not be one to make it through.
Oh this Word, It must be written
on the table of your heart;
Speak this Word,
Get It into your spirit
and It never shall depart.
