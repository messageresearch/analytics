[0:04] um God bless you
[0:06] um before I sing the song I actually
[0:08] have a testimony
[0:10] um
[0:12] ever since we came here like the last
[0:14] time there was a youth I and we were
[0:16] announced that there was going to be a
[0:17] banquet I was really excited and I was
[0:21] wanting to come
[0:22] but
[0:24] um
[0:25] just last week a certain like a certain
[0:27] type of like discouragement came over me
[0:29] and I just felt like I wanted to find
[0:31] every excuse not to come
[0:32] and like I would tell my friend at work
[0:34] I don't think I'm gonna be coming and
[0:36] then I all of a sudden I got a cold
[0:38] and then I got an excuse that you know
[0:41] what I have a cold I'm not gonna come I
[0:42] don't want to get anyone sick and
[0:44] everything else
[0:45] but um on Wednesday uh I was listening
[0:49] to a sermon
[0:50] and there's something that was said like
[0:53] that really like
[0:55] stuck out to me and then I read it to my
[0:57] friend at work
[0:58] and the testimony is that like in the
[1:01] line of what I I had read
[1:04] um brother Toby spoke about it yesterday
[1:07] um so he spoke about
[1:10] purified purified for service or
[1:13] purifying for service and where I was
[1:16] reading is um it's a message from uh
[1:19] brother Branham
[1:20] where it the title of the message is if
[1:23] God be with us then where are the
[1:25] Miracles
[1:26] and on uh the 1616 paragraph it says
[1:31] um take the cloud away then
[1:33] what happens the sun is right there the
[1:37] only thing on the only thing you have to
[1:39] do today
[1:41] see not oh Jesus come and heal me oh
[1:45] Jesus give me the Holy Ghost just take
[1:48] the cloud away he's already there he
[1:52] came he he come
[1:54] um
[1:55] 1900 years ago and he still there and
[1:59] he'll always be there I'm Alive
[2:03] forevermore the same yesterday to Dan
[2:05] forever and that goes in line with what
[2:08] brother Toby was saying about purifying
[2:10] yourself like most of the time we're
[2:11] asking yourself do I have the Holy
[2:13] Spirit do I have this but there's a lot
[2:15] that we need to get rid of in order to
[2:18] even get to him because he already gave
[2:20] it and like when he came and died for us
[2:22] there's a lot of things that he had
[2:24] already done for us
[2:25] and
[2:27] um I also wanted to thank Sister Lisa
[2:29] for the activity that she did because
[2:31] it's one of the reasons that I'm gonna
[2:34] be singing I was not gonna sing the song
[2:36] I was also discouraged to sing the song
[2:38] but um through the fellowship that we
[2:41] had I got to talk to a young sister and
[2:45] um it pushed me to want to sing this
[2:47] song even more
