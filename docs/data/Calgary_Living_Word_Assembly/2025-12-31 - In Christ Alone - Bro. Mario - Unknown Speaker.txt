Description:
In Christ alone will I glory
Though I could pride myself in battles won
For I've been blessed beyond measure 
And by His strength alone I overcome
Oh I could stop and count successes
Like diamonds in my hands
But those trophies could not equal
To the grace by which I stand

Chorus
In Christ alone I place my trust
And find my glory in the power of the Cross
In every victory let it be said of me
My source of strength, my source of hope
Is Christ alone

In Christ alone will I glory
For only by His grace I am redeemed
For only His tender mercy
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
And now I seek no greater honor
Than just to know You more
And to count my gains but losses
To the glory of the Lord
