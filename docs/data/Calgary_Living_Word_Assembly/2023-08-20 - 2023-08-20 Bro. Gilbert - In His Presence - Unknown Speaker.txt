you as we commit all things now in your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you musicians thank you [Music] I would invite you now to turn to our Bibles Isaiah chapter 6. sometimes it's hard to come and speak after we had such a wonderful Services last weekend and especially from listening from a full-time evangelist now you come to a part-time evangelist I don't know how it's going to be but I hope you have prayed for me you continue to pray for me that God may have his own way our brother took us up to up to the throne and we felt good I saw each one of us was feeling good but now before you go there sometimes it's good to check your ways am I in the right way am I working right have I qualified to be there so that's why sometimes I think it's good to bring up part-time evangelists to bring us down so that we check ourselves once more amen Isaiah chapter 6. we read from verse one in the year that King usia died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphines each one had six wings with the twain he covered his face and with the twain he covered his feet and with the twain he did fly and one cried under another and said holy holy is the Lord of hordes the whole earth is full of his glory and the pose of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with the smoke then said I what is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the meetings of our people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims onto me having a life called in his hand which he had taken with us with the tongues from of the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and say it low this have touched touched their lips and their iniquity is taken away and thy sin is patched and I had the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will cover us then said I here am I send me may God add the blessings you can take your seats this morning I have a short subject which I've picked from the message the prophet preached and he called it in his presence now you can be in the church but you are not in his presence you can go on your knees to pray but you are not in his presence you can praise and shout and do everything that you can but you are not in his presence but there is something special about coming in his presence hello there is something special about coming in his presence and you can never come in his presence and live the way you came in something has to happen and that is what we need each one of us to come into His presence amen now his presence is usually manifested by his voice you can recognize his presence by his voice I want us to be very keen because this morning we need to go into his presence his presence by his voice in the Garden of Eden Genesis chapter 3 verse 8. they had the voice walking in the garden when they had the voice what they did was to hide themselves why because God's presence had come in their meetings now my brother put for me 620909e 6209 09 e paragraph 11. paragraph 11. okay then we realize how little we are when we get when how great he is then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is when you go in his presence and realize how great he is then you will realize how little you are yourself now and how close we come in of coming to his presence somehow or another it's always throat a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God it must have an effect on you when you come in his presence you can never come in his presence and live the way you came in no something has to happen and each one of us we are called now to come into His presence if we will ever have any effect or any impact to anybody anywhere we must come in the presence of God for you to have an assurance that I am going home there is nothing that can hinder me then you must come in his presence God help us move to paragraph 13. okay I've been privileged to hear quarterly men speak it was said one time of Charles Finney little pretty fellow never wait over over about 110 pounds but he had such a forceful way of speaking not me he was trying to the of course he was trying the Acoustics one day in in a building they didn't have PA systems then and there was a man repairing up in the balcony oh up in the roof of the place and he had the man come in so he didn't know who they were he just kept quiet and Mr Finney was going to try the Acoustics after spending much time in prayer for that Revival that he was going to hold he tried his voice to see how it would carry he slipped up quickly to the pulpit and said repent or perish and he said it with such a force after being under the anointing of God till the man dropped out of the top of the balcony down into the floor or out of the top of the building onto the floor why Finn had been in the presence of God and his voice just the just by saying somebody failed failed presence so you cut once you get into the presence that presence transfers into you and you can also impact somebody else and that's what we need today may God help us okay now when the first man as soon as he had sinned and done something wrong and when God came into his presence or he came into the presence of God that was Adam he could not stand in the presence of God he ran under hid himself in the bush and tried to cover himself with a thick Leaf because he not he was standing In The Presence of Jehovah the Creator that was the first man when he realized the presence of God then he felt that he was unfair and worthy he decided to run away but God who is rich in Mercy came out calling where at thou Adam and he's still the same God okay paragraph 16 we could go back and take in Genesis the 17th chapter and the third verse when the Great Partridge Abraham when he came into the presence of God and God spoke to him chapter 17 and in the name of all in the name of almighty God Abraham fell on his face that great part-right servant of God could not stand in the presence of God though he served him for 25 years Faithfully but when God moved into his presence the patriarch fell on his face because he could not stand in the presence of God you can imagine Abraham the son of the Son of God what he did when he came in the presence of God what Adam did when he came in the presence of God now we say it earlier on that the presence of God is recognized by the voice of God now we are living in the days of The Voice now if we since we are living in the days of the voice which means God's presence is here hello which means God's presence is here now if you cannot have a change in you then who is the problem because you can never get in the presence of God and come out the way you went in so if you cannot change and you claim to have been in the presence of God there is something wrong with you God help us I'm already feeling the Heat and they have not started preaching may God help us so we have seen Adam when he came in the presence of God we have seen Abraham when he came in the presence of God oh my in Exodus chapter 3 we find Moses the great servant and the prophet of God when he was back on the back side of the desert that man was a holy man he had been born for the purpose he was born from his mother's womb to be a prophet he had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people because he understood that he was to deliver his people but one day on the back side of the desert when he come into the presence of God he chucked off his shoes and fell to his feet knowing that he was standing on a Holy Ground that was Moses now we've talked of Adam we've talked of Abraham we've talked of Moses how they behaved when they came in the presence of God brethrens follow up with me it is something I want to say this morning about coming in his presence many things we do we do the way we do because we have never been in the presence of God or we have never realized the presence of God in our meetings but we have said God's presence is here now if his presence is here then we need to change we need to feel his presence amen paragraph 19 but when God came down on top of Mount Sinai and the whole Mountain caught a fire and the smoke was flying from it like a furnace and the voice of God roared out Israel fell on their face and said let Moses speak and not God these were God's people chosen people they desired to they desired to hear from God but what happened when he came on the road when his presence came down they said no no no no no no no no that Moses speak but not God we would rather Moses speak to us but not God help us amen any okay they had carried the Commandments and everything but when God spoke and they moved up into his presence they realized that they were out they were they were not right there was something that was lacking because they were in the presence of God so when you get into his presence then you realize what you have and what you don't have but many times we justify ourselves why because we have never come into His presence so I beg you and I plead with you this morning let us surrender ourselves so that we go in his presence it will bring a change in our lives it will make us think right it will make us do right when we come into His presence amen now paragraph 22 Abraham recognized himself wrong Adam recognized himself wrong which was the son of God recognized himself wrong Moses recognized himself wrong Israel as a church and Nation recognized themselves wrong depart from me for I am a sinful man he didn't try to say now I am a holy and worthy to receive this he said I am a sinful man all BattleCraft 23 23 one time a self-style religionist with all the theology that he could learn under a great teacher called kamariel his name was Saul of tassas which which we know as Paul religious to the to the daughter he not all the ins and outs of their of their religion he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees in the Hebrew or a Hebrew of the Hebrews he was anointed man as called as mad shrewd educated claimed he not God from baby up but one day on his road to add Damascus that Pillar of Fire shined over him he fell off his foot on the ground and then passed and said Lord what would you have me to do that's what happens when you come in his presence Lord what would you have me to do okay what about the paragraph 26 what about the great Saint John of Revelation 1 1 7 when he was shot the vision and looked and had a voice speaking to him remember we are we are saying God's presence is recognized by The Voice so mark that one okay when he he looked and had a voice speaking to him and he turned to look to see the voice I don't know how do you dance to see The Voice yeah okay when he turned to see the voice and he saw seven cold and candlesticks and one stood in the meetings of the seven cold and candlesticks with hair like wool eyes like flames of fire feet like pillars of brass he was cudded with a coward and kadle around the pups and he was called the word of God and when the Great Saint John had walked with Christ he leaned upon his possum when he done all these things as I said this morning Paul's Ministry exceeded of them here after John had walked with Jesus talked with him slept with him ate it with him but when he seen him standing there that glorified State he said he fell like a Dead Man At His Feet amen think of it we can come to church we can talk we can praise God and so forth but oh brother when we see him coming that's what we need brethrens when we see him coming something will be different in our hearts when we come in his presence something will be different in our hearts oh my we might think of religious Duty by by to go to church and pay our tithes we might think that he will keep the laws of the church and recite all the crits but once once let us get a look at him the whole things changed all the way around yes it sure will now Isaiah where we read he was a prophet a mighty prophet but when he came in the presence of God he said war unto me for I am an I am unclean dwelling amongst unclean people but he was a prophet why was he and green when he came in the presence of God and we said when you come in the presence of God you feel how little you are and how great he is so many times we do things because we have never come in the presence of God may God help us Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet Isaiah preached the word he was a minister Isaiah was a holy man but one day standing in the temple he fell into a trance and he saw the glory of God he saw the angels with wings over their face Wings over their feet flying with wings crying holy holy is the Lord God Almighty that Prophet realized that he was nothing he said what is me for I am a man of unclean lips a prophet a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of them I am a man with unclean lips and I dwell amongst people that is on clean lips what is me because I see the glory of God I think what we need is to see the glory of God it would help us amen under he said when that angel cried the post of the temple Shook Back and Forth brother that will make not only the boss of the temple going to shake but the whole heavens and the Earth is going to shake when he comes again the mountains will free and the Sea will fit away and the scream hide us from the face of that of him that he sits upon the throne it is going to be a terrible time for The Sinner now remember if such a holy man recognized themselves sinners in the presence of God what will the Sinner and the encodile do on that day now we are not addressing the the Sinners and the unquotely we are tracing those who already claim they have been in the presence of God we talked about Adam we talked about Abraham Moses and the rest when they came in the presence of God how they failed now we want to address now the people who already say they have been in the presence of God so that now we see the effect of coming in the presence of God amen okay now remember if such a holy man okay what what will people do sit in the meetings what will the people do that has that has seen the power of God that has had the countdown of the word that has seen God manifested himself and beyond a shadow of Doubt every scripture fulfilled and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again may God have mercy on us we need now to go in the presence of God if what we have seen it is a proof that God is in our meetings then it behooves each one of us to get into the presence of God that is the only thing that will make you sing I am going home and there is nothing that will hinder me hey amen oh what kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold himself right before us and see the glory of God just the same as the men did and that kind of men Cried Out prophets and searches upon whom the word is best upon if they cried and fell to their feet under screamed I am a ma I am I'm a man of Unholy lips and cleanliness what will it be then for that man who won't even confess his sins what will it be for that hard-hearted man that thinks he knows more about God's creation than God does himself may God have mercy on us let's not assume it's not now time to presume it's time to be sure it's time to come to a point where you can say I am going home and nothing will hinder me I've put everything under the blood I've confessed my sins I am right why I have been in the presence of God help us paragraph 35 this is evangelism this is the time to shake people please sorry I'm not checking you I'm just creating the quote the prophet saying this is the time to shake people then Shake ourselves and see where we are standing we are going I am going so the prophet is saying time to shake people this is the time that God said there would come a time he shook Mount Sinai one time but there would come as shaking again that he wouldn't only Shake Mount Sinai but he would Shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of the scripture but we receive a king a kingdom that cannot be moved if you have received that Kingdom there is nothing to fear you have already received the kingdom you know and you know that you have received the kingdom oh my yes we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved Hallelujah everything that that he shook that peace that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the Earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but that word shall never pass away for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the kids of Hell will never Prevail against it the case of Hell will be against you but they will never prevail if you have been in his presence oh oh my okay God help us paragraph 38 repented Sinners though doesn't have any fear repented you have repented right hello those who have repented right they don't have any fear why they know they have put everything under the blood there is what God wants us to do and he tells us how to do it so the sinner who has repented right there is no fear why he knows that there is a bloody sacrifice waiting to stand in his place that is what gives me the consolation I have seen the glory of God I have felt his power I know the touch of his hand I know the touch of his chastisement I know that he has he is God and I know I am undone but there is one standing there for me there is one who stands there and says father lay all of his iniquity upon me because he stood for me down on the earth Hallelujah then I walk to the throne of God boldly having Grace in my heart to know it is not by good works but it is by his mercies I am saved not what I could do but what I could what I could join but what I could say but it is by his grace that I am saved so we are not ordained to do nothing but to stay in the world take in the word let the word be your guide put everything aside and let the word guide you God help us then after that when we come in his presence when a man once comes into the presence of God he is changed forever oh sometimes I feel I'm on the mountain sometimes I feel I'm in the in the in the valley but the prophet says a man who has been in the presence of God is changed forever he takes over he takes over challenges will come but you know whom you are you have believed you know who goes ahead of you you know where you stand trials will come and let them come hello let them come if you know where you are standing okay about the Samaritan woman when she came in the presence of God she changed her life her life was changed and the prophet says yes they have got to do it a man when a man when once you come into the presence of God you have a responsibility to tell others you have a responsibility to tell others if you have come into His presence how you may not stand on the pulpit to preach but your life can preach to somebody your life can preach to somebody will look at you and say this is a Christian I want to be like this man I want to be like this woman you are alive if you have been in the presence of God your life will preach to somebody you will have a responsibility to tell someone else when the Samaritan woman came into the presence of God what happened she ran into the city telling people come and see the one I have met God help us oh my now Moses was responsible to tell others Peter when he came in his presence he was responsible to tell others Paul when he came in his presence he was responsible to tell others now if you have been in the presence of God you are also responsible to tell someone else your life can speak to somebody oh yes sorry listen to this story paragraph 54. a young lady come from a country Church and her father was an old-fashioned shouting preacher or a member of the church and so she moved into the City and she got all mixed up with the women down there and got through acting like they did and the and and the Fashions and one day she was kind of ashamed of her Papa and Mama to come or her father rather her mother was dead so the old man only thing he will do get up of a morning eat his breakfast get the piper read it and cry and pray and shout all day long I'm sure if you have such a person in our meetings many of us will want to avoid him his business was to read the Bible and pray read and pray and run up and down the room and he was a little embarrassed young ones please don't be embarrassed by your parents don't be embarrassed by this by your parents holding this message don't be embarrassed oh my oh my mom is coming and my friends will see she's wearing a long dress you feel embarrassed God have mercy on you here was our God she was embarrassed by her father being an Old Fashioned believer God have mercy on us so one day he was going to entertain her church members the prophet is not me it's the prophet she was going to entertain her church members so she was a member of a member of a church somewhere and they were going to have a little tea party like they always have you know so she didn't know what she was going to do with her dad after all it was had that day so she decided to put him up in the attic and say daddy you know you don't want to be around where these women are do you say no I don't believe I want to do that he said well we are going to have the church women up here today and we are going to have a little meeting a little prayer meeting it was a prayer meeting I tell you that why don't you just go up in the attic said I just believe I will do so she said read this book so she gave him a geography book because if she gave him the Bible it would be chaotic so she gave him a geography book and told him to sit in the Attic which which he agreed and he was there all right but as he read it as he read it you can read a history book and get a word for me you can you can read a geography book and you get something that can change your life while he was up there or he read about the bottomless beat of the sea things went hey things went wrong upstairs until she had to run Daddy I thought I gave you a geography book he said yes I know but I read something oh that related to what I read in the Bible yesterday can you get something that you read in the Bible yesterday today may God help us oh my about that something Cut Loose upstairs or the screaming and jumping and the plaster falling the old man running up and down through the attic just as hard as he could go jumping up and down and hollering glory to God glory to God the women didn't know what happened up there what they had upstairs so direct so directly down the steps he come hard as he could go she said Daddy I gave you a geography to read God help us amen okay I'm rushing Against Time there is some there is some more we have to know that you know you have been in the presence of God that is the only thing that will matter is to know that you have been in the presence of God please I beg you the things that happens in our meetings is because we have never been in the presence of God may God help us this morning so that we can change how we approach him so that we can go in his presence because what happens in his presence the prophet says you can never be in his presence and come out the same no something has to change amen oh that was Jacob one time he lied to his father his father wherever he was wherever he was going he could lie but one day he was going home and who was waiting a Sao was waiting now he realized that he didn't have what it takes to meet with the Esau hello credit he realized that he didn't have what it takes to meet with Esau I wonder how many of us have what it takes to meet with Esau Esau was coming so what he did he needed to come in the presence of God and when he peeled an altar where he met with God after meeting with God now he had to go to meet with Esau what happened when he met with Esau Esau was confused whether he's going to meet with an enemy or a friend or a brother so I think what we need is to have an experience of me of getting in the presence of God so when you got to meet with your enemies they will be confused They Don't Know Who You Are that's what we need preterance to have what it takes to meet with the Esau and there are so many Sowers around us God help us no wonder the prophet says we need more Jacobs today we need more Jacobs today who can realize that I don't have what it takes to meet with myself amen he had heart signs he had he had heard about God he had had dreams which many of us we always post about oh I dreamed oh I guess God spoke to me we always talk about those things but now it came to a point where he needed to be in the presence of God God help us oh my in the presence God makes a way to get men in their presence then they make their decision some of them will run from him some some to run to him if they are predestinated to life they will believe it okay paragraph 72 Psalms 16 8. David said I have said the Lord before me that is a good thing to do psalm 16 8 I have said the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it he wanted to be conscious of his presence hello when you set the Lord before you you are always conscious of his presence may God help us send the Lord before our face so we will be conscious of his presence put him first why put him fast before you before you why then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you are in the presence of God do we ever realize that that you have constantly in the presence of God help us when you realize God is around you watch what you say hello could some preach with me when you realize God's presence is around you watch what to say amen God help us oh bye listen to this story paragraph 82 there was a man called Charles Charles defidi a lawyer a great Philadelphia lawyer but when he come into the presence of God he dropped his law study and become a mightiest preacher of these nations ever had yet was a preacher because one day he come in the presence of God he thought once he had started the ministry you know his book I got his autobiography he went out to pray he thought he was a preacher hello he thought he was a preacher a mighty preacher he had a desire that he wanted to preach and he had him a few summons he had tried to preach he went out one day out of his office to pray when out in the woods he got down behind an old blown down tree where he had gone every afternoon very religious but he didn't believe in that there was two women in the church kept saying Mr Finney we are praying that you will receive the Holy Ghost he said I go to the Holy Ghost said I am a preacher they say Mr Finney you are a great man and you've got a great hold of the word but you need the Holy Ghost we are praying for you sweet little women I wonder if we have such a sweet little Amen in our house instead of talking about the preacher they say they went to him and said we are praying for you that you receive the Holy Ghost may God help us do we have such a little sisters instead of talking about a preacher they said we are praying for you that you receive the Holy Ghost but the man was claiming to have the Holocaust but these sisters they had this sentiment they knew something had not happened okay so he went on so every day he would go out behind his office his boss and all of them there he walked and he he got out out of his law office and go out there to pray and one day he was out there praying and he had a brush break he thought his post was coming up handing him he jumped up real quick he was saying Lord Oh Lord oh Lord I believe you and some French broke he caught he raised up and said looked around and see what it was broke the brush and it was then he come he realized that that flash had broke for a purpose he stood there tears running down his cheeks he said maybe them women's were right oh my I am ashamed of somebody to see me talking to my God how many of us sometimes when you are with the non-believers and the food is before you you say in Jesus name you cannot even pray you fear hello yeah yeah you fear they will see you pray then what do you need to get in the presence of God have mercy on us oh I am ashamed of somebody to see me talking to my God but I I would think it was a honor for somebody to see me talking to my boss how much greater is my Lord than my boss Lord forgive me and fill me with the Holy Ghost sometimes Soul resistance you have to forgive me sometimes sisters they have two sets of dresses one for the office and one for the church because in the office you want to be like them you will feel ashamed when they know you are a Christian hello God have mercy on us God have mercy on us we need I told Finney today we need a church feeling today who can realize that them women who are right I feel ashamed when they see me talking to my to my Lord and yet I will feel it is a honor to people for people to see me talking to my boss what about talking to my God we feel ashamed when we say let's go before God to talk to him oh some God have mercy on us we need to go in the presence of God what we need is to go in the presence of God and you can never call in the presence of God and come out the same no I need it I need it I need it today that's the only way God have mercy on us Oh my he ran down real quick to his office he caught to screaming so hard he had to go behind the door said Lord I will bring this Grace upon you hide me back here till I get over this spell why he had come in the presence of God has a way to bring you in his presence he has a way to bring you in his presence oh my oh my that was paragraph Okay that was about Moody okay Moody of 85. hardly not his ABCs that is right his karma was poor somebody told him one day your grandma is awful poor Muti said but I am winning Souls with it God help us don't bother about what people will say put about pleasing God I want my life to be pleasing him I just want my life to be pleasing him oh my so Moody's manager happened to see okay there was a there was a news reporter he wrote bad things about him so the Moody's manager happened to see it and said Mr Moody Moody I will read this to you moody couldn't read it he couldn't read it himself so he said I'll read it I'll read you the editorial and he wrote it Muti just Shrugged his shoulder said certainly not they come to see Christ why because he had been in the presence of God amen amen now I can now start by someone that was the introduction when you come in the presence of God that presence of God now transfers from God to you I'll repeat it when you come in the presence of God that presence now transferred where our brother ready to last last weekend all that was that was in God was brought in Christ and all that was in Christ was brought in there now that presence is now in you when you get into his presence that presence now is transferred now once that presence is transferred into you then wherever you are you are his presence now what will happen when you sit some next to somebody who has the presence of God hello what will happen sitting closer to somebody who has the presence of God what will happen if you lie to somebody who has the presence of God what will happen if you occupy to somebody who has the presence of God hello are we following Saints yeah let's look at these things when you are talking about that brother have you ever realized that he could be holding the presence of God hello do we ever realize that's why I started by saying that things men at times we do is because we have never come in the presence of God now when you come in the presence of God and that presence is transferred in you and that sister the presence of God has transferred into her what happens when you meet with the presence of God in you and and her what will happen hello okay now in the message enzyme 530606 kamsa do you believe with all your heart do you believe that you are standing in his presence not your brother his presence in his presence now here the prophet is saying okay come yeah you are in his presence but not in the presence of pranam he was a man but he's saying come you are in his presence why because the presence of God now was in this man so he could say come you are now in his presence so can we also say come you are now in his presence 53 1100 prayer line you also need Jesus Christ as your savior you are not a Christian yet that is the truth it is the same holy spirit that was on Jesus Christ you are standing in his presence now you see what we need his presence in us now oh my in the message testimony do you believe sister you believe do you realize that you are standing in his presence not mine not mine not in your brother but in his presence why all that was in God was brought in Christ all that was in Christ is now in The Believer who has been in his presence okay now going home I am going home yeah now

us we are holding things against other who are having the presence of God in them God have mercy on us we hold something we say it doesn't matter it's just a small thing but there's talkings the story of the stockings it looks so simple a very small thing a small matter actually her mother-in-law that thing he was a prophet he didn't want her to go in the other presence with that thing on her heart
