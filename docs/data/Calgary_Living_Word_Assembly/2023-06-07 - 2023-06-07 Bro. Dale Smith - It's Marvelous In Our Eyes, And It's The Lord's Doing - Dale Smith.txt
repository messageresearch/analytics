I think I got that right um tremendous brother I got to hear him for the first time in the upper room in 2005 and he's just become a real good friend over the years maybe we could sing that song into

foreign [Music] I want to get a good look at everybody I forget what happens after we get started and we thank you all so the berry too think about us and we were we just wanted to I told the church I said well I'm going to go up to Canada I've been up there in about three years so I said I'm going to go on a fishinary trip and uh and while I'm up there I'll get to get to see some of the Saints and stop in and visit thank you all that'll be just fine if while you're standing amen our brothers praying for us and if you have your Bibles I'd like for you to turn with me Into the Book of Psalms and there we want to be in the 118th psalm uh it's a it's a little Evangelistic thought this evening a had a preacher one time said that that every Pastor needs to needs to go out and preach so he can see if he still knows how and so you get to doing you have to kind of change the venue to come and and to work as uh as as a Shepherd over the flock you know you have to you have to kind of change your your uh your Mantra just a little bit and try to be all things to all people and so uh sometimes you have to teach and sometimes you have to you know you have to preach hard and sometimes you have to just be very patient but you know with an evangelist you know you get to kind of just love them and leave them you know you just uh just throw your head back and and let the chips fall at the pastor take care of it and so uh we got to do that for many years always I told Brother Berry today I Never Had a Bad Day in Calgary I just have to say that always been a blessing to be here amen sister Shelly God bless you amen each one that every time we've ever come this way why the Lord has always blessed us amen and trust that he'll be a blessing this evening and the 118th Psalm bring you greetings from the Saints there in Flagstaff Arizona North Country Christian Fellowship where we Pastor presently amen you all come on down see us some of these times amen and we'll treat you so many ways you'll like one of them so uh you just always always welcome and uh so I think we're our church sits at about 7 000 feet elevation so bring your oxygen and then we and so we want to read here this evening just as a little thought as we try to be mindful of our time we want to begin reading at verse 22 18 118th Psalm and verse 22. the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner and this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes and this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it may the Lord Jesus bless the reading of the word this evening as you make yourselves comfortable I want to title the message this evening if I may it's marvelous in our eyes and it is the Lord's doing and we want to uh just take this little thought um striking to me first of all as we look at this passage of scripture that each one of those verses are used many times independently of each other you see a beautiful day this is the day you know you see Sunday you come to church birds are singing It's a resurrection oh this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it you know you and you but you seldom uh uh incorporate that passage of scripture along with the stone that the builders rejected you know you just it your mind doesn't somehow another meld these two together and then whenever you begin to think about how you know you see something how that the Lord does something you say well it's the Lord's doing and it's marvelous you know and you give God praise for those things but in reality as we look here this evening that these three scriptures run in concert with each other that they're all three together and they're there for a very important reason did I fall down and uh and they're they're there together for a purpose that they that the that when the uh when the psalmist then places these things here so now we have to uh we have to look at this in the context that it was that it was pinned because it was it was they were placed together for a very important reason as we as we look at Psalms 118 and verse 22 it speaks of the stone which the builders refuse now first and foremost that this scripture is actually dealing with the nation of Israel that this is speaking not not primarily because remember it's in the Old Testament prior to the coming of Christ David here in this Psalm of Thanksgiving he's actually pointing to a greater day a time because brother Brown said he would get in the spirit as these prophets would get in the spirit and they would begin to prophesy that they actually placed themselves they were under such an anointing that they spoke concerning themselves David in the 22nd Psalm said you know my God my God why is Thou forsaken me you know my bones they stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet and it begins to cry out as though he was the very one that was being crucified well in this in this Psalm of Thanksgiving he comes down into this place and he begins to speak about the stone which the builders have refused and he's speaking of the nation of Israel as a whole and that they because they were A persecuted Church they were a forsaken lot and so and they were and so so he's speaking of that as whole but then you realize that as he speaks of Israel then he also has to speak concerning the very headstone of Israel or the very the very uh the very capping of what that Zechariah would later prophesy concerning The Headstone that was going to come down and there's a rubable and and Joshua would be there building the church and and it was speaking of this one that would come that Daniel had saw this stone that would come out of the mountain that was that was cut out but with without the use of hands and then it would come down and it would strike the image of the Gentile ages in the feet and it would crush it in the feet it would destroy it grind it the powder and this very one well it would speak of would then be personified in the person of Christ and that what Christ then would become that headstone he would become that stumbling Stone and Paul then tells us to the Greeks it's foolishness to the to the Jews it's a stumbling Stone but to us it's the power of God unto salvation and so that there would be this this one that would come but then we realize that he the person of Christ would be personified amen through the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the New Testament Church and that New Testament Church then would be the one that would be crying Grace Grace unto itself and it would then materialize itself in the fruition because remember it was head and Corner he's Alpha and Omega Allelujah and so then he would come down at the end and be personified in the New Testament Church at the end time and so now as it begins to speak of this headstone this one this Builder would read how the builders would refuse that this has become the very the very Crux of the entire message would be this one stone this one that would actually be the very the the that Peter said you have become Lively stones Hallelujah that we are the Living Stones we're the ones that the the Temple of the Living God and this is what the world has rejected and we are the ones that the ends of the world have come upon and now the the very the very the very rejection and we're going to look at a couple of things here as we move along and so this one where the man preached to us a message called the rejected King now when he in this message of the Masterpiece as well he uses this text in Isaiah 53 and in Masterpiece he uses the whole chapter I'm going to take an excerpt from verse 10 Isaiah 53 and verse 10. yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him now look at the language here he hath put him to grief and without shall make his soul and offerings shall for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands so it's a it's pleases the lord it's a pleasure to bruise this one this one that the stone which the builders have refused that this is something that pleases the Lord because it goes into the next verse he said this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in her eyes so now then what what what the Lord took pleasure in smiting the Messiah that and and so this becomes to uh to our our mortality into our to our to our mentality the way that we think that this is a horrible thing that is a terrible that for them to reject the stone for them to forsake the very Chief and Cornerstone for the smiting of the Messiah to see him despise and rejected of men that this becomes that this is not a the the the language of pleasure and the language of pleasing is somehow alienated from these two thoughts but yet the psalmist says it's marvelous in our eyes that that because this is the Lord's doing that when God did these things oh he knew uh the the what the result of what was going to happen from the smiding from the rejection from the bleeding from the torture that was going to happen to Christ that was going to happen to the church through the Dark Ages because the more that they persecuted the church the further the church was able to expand they they went into all the world and began to preach the gospel they forsooked their their their their their homes they forsook their their wealth they forsook everything for the cause of the gospel and there's the more rejection that came upon the church the it was like a casting of seed upon the Earth and and they were the more they murdered them the more the people would surrender their lives to Christ the more that they that they they drove them into the Foreign Fields the more the gospel got spread and it was like shaking a dandelion you know you think you're going to pull that dandelion you better be careful when they get in full bloom and those little those little Tufts you know you better you you go out and mow those things you say well I'm gonna cut those things down well you just spread them and it's a casting of the seed amen it's a it's a it's a a further manifestation and it's a marvelous thing hallelujah it's marvelous in her eyes but it's the Lord's doing the more he smoothed him the more the the more that he he uh persecuted the more despised he became the more rejected he came the more they forsook the Builder the the Cornerstone the greater the population of the church became but it's the Lord's doing in First Peter chapter 2 it begins at verse 8. it says a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they were appointed to their disobedience there's a there was a group that was called to obedience and there was children of Disobedience of which we were one time identified but now through the Regeneration through the for the new birth there's a change that comes he says watch but but ye H ye means me Hallelujah ye means you you are a chosen generation oh think about it Church a royal priesthood awoke Nation so I throw that in there oh we're awoke all right the seals amen woke us up Hallelujah and made us a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that hath called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light Hallelujah so with Marvelous Light in the end time and laodicea he said they would be blind they would be miserable they'd be wretched they would be naked but he said get some ice half anoint your eyes that you could see why because with ice have amen marvelous light shines into your marvelous eyes that you can see marvelous things oh praise be to God so this we're a chosen generation were chosen to see marvelous things we're chosen to see with Marvelous Light I was sharing with the church the other day that when I was a young man and some of you raised in Snow Country you understand this I got out playing with a young man and I got what they call snow blind I got my eyes burnt with the with the bright sunlight because we didn't have sunglasses we were just kids we're out there playing in that snow in the bright Sun shining on it reflected off and got my face all burnt and my eyes got burnt I couldn't see for a couple of days and and then later at different times of you know out welding and I'll be spot welding in your kind of look and turn your head you know pull your hood down and you know you spot weld a lot and that that flash of that of that uh that welder burnt the redness of my eyes and so it you know just just abused myself as a you know as a you know we're rednecks you know we just we just do what we're not supposed to do and and so over time that my eyes have become very sensitive to the to the Sun and to bright sunlight into like snow and and like days like today where it was really bright and I ran off and left my sunglasses and so so I said well tomorrow I know where I'm going I'm going to Bass Pro I'm going to give you some or Cabela's whichever one it is and I'm gonna get me some some sunglasses so and uh but I got to thinking about that and that this is Marvelous Light and so in Marvelous Light you can see marvelous things but yet that so there's many times that church people especially message people that they come in to The Marvelous Light but because of damage and because of Disobedience and because of fears and all these different things and many times it's just a lack of experience with God that they want to put on some kind of tinted lens so that they can take a certain amount of Truth but they can't take the full illumination that there's a certain part of it that they're willing oh I can see that God sent a prophet wonderful I can see that water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus wonderful I can see one God that's great I can you know I can see the serpent seed oh wonderful but holiness oh I better I can't I can't take that because that that goes against what I what I want you know I want I want I want to filter the message through my filter but we can't do that because brother bear said if you have a thinking man's filter then you will have a holy man's taste and so when it comes to Holiness we find that people in the in and we're finding it more and more that they're you know the makeup's coming back you know the shorter skirts are coming back tight clothes are coming back you know men are wearing jewelry and and and and and and bracelets and necklaces and all kinds of things are coming back and you're saying where did that come from it's because they're not able to look at Marvelous Light they're looking at filtered light but the Bible says that we have come into out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light That Eagles are able to look directly at the Sun and go into the Sun and then look down because they've absorbed the light now they're the the pupil is opened up and now they can take in the full illumination they can look down and see fresh kill amen from great altitudes and now we've sworn up Amen in prophetic ability to look down and see fresh kill not some decomposed you know uh Roadkill but no this is this is this is the message of Marvelous Light in times past we were not a people but are now the people of God which have obtained Mercy which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy this word that's used here in the phrase Marvelous Light it's also used there in the Old Testament as the English word marvelous but they're they're actually a little bit different they have app they could be applied the same way but they're I know I kind of bring you the comparison when David uses this this uh this word in Psalms 18 23 that it is marvelous in our eyes what he's showing us how the the the the stone being rejected and and and and and and being forsaken and uh and that that the to look at that and to see it in the in light of Isaiah 53 and to see it in light of Psalms 22 and and all the Messiah signs that speak of the Messiah prophecies that concern the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and so when he uses this word marvelous in this in the in the in the Hebrew text it actually lends to the to the definition of difficult the word marvelous actually means not like not like it is in the New Testament but it means more that this is difficult this is hard for us to look at that this is hard for us to comprehend that our comprehension of the of of this Stone being rejected of this of this despising of the stone this despising of the Messiah this crucifixion this piercing of the hands this one that they that they knew that was going to be God and flesh and that how that he was going to be relative because brother I'm asking the the the rabbi he asked him he said what relationship does uh Christ have to God he said he will be God and so they understood that and so all Jews understood that this one that would come that he would be Isaiah 53 that he would come but yet he would be despised he would be rejected he would be he would be his the chastisement of our peace would be laid upon him and so the Jews understood that and when he looked at this and said he said the stone that is rejected this is difficult for our eyes that's what he was saying it's marvelous it's it's big it's terrible they actually use the word terrible in some places that it's a terrible thing and so much that it's that it's that it's drastic this is this is a this is a this is a big thing that's going on here and it's really hard for us to to comprehend it's difficult for us to comprehend but then when Peter then comes over and he's talking about the same verses scripture and he's and he says now then he said the stone of stumbling this rock of offense he said but he he's called us to be able to see this because of Marvelous Light and so this Marvelous Light that's used in the New Testament actually speaks of a uh a pious admiration admirable excellent it lends to the thought of passing human comprehension so think about it that you're a chosen generation that have been chosen to comprehend something that is beyond human comprehension so now that our human comprehension is is now uh uh unable to comprehend what God is doing but it's something that the Lord is doing but yet you've been chosen and with the choosing you've been pressurized you've been you've been uh illuminated you've been given marvelous highs by marvelous ice have to see Marvelous Light to understand marvelous things that are so far beyond human comprehension that we cannot grasp it humanly oh but but the new birth allows us to supernaturally step away from our from our uh uh uh uh uh uh human ability and say but Lord I see this but I don't understand it it's amazing to me that I even understood I've even called to this message I wouldn't have never called myself I never tried to call myself but this is amazing grace and it's a Beyond human apprehension and it's outside of my human ability but yet God has called me to it that it's it's beyond human comprehension it this word uh marvelous means causing amazement I'm Amazed that he loves me Hallelujah I'm Amazed that he called me I'm Amazed that's why it's amazing grace it's amazement joined with Terror Oh I thought Lord Jesus the Bible says behold the goodness and the severity of God that until you can understand the severity you can never really appreciate the goodness and when you've received the goodness of God and you see what the alternative was then you see the terror behold the goodness and the severity of God it means that it's striking that it's extraordinary it's surprising how many times has the word surprised you that it just shocked you brother Brandon said it's striking over and over he says strike isn't the Striking how that the Lord would do a certain thing a certain way and and and reveal something to you through such simplicity oh my it's it's a wonder and I got to thinking about the different wonders of the world that as man and is it in his exploration that he found these things in men and accomplishments that men did there so you have different things it's called the ancient wonders of the world like the Great Pyramids you know the Sphinx the Wall of China uh uh you know uh Leaning Tower peace these different things were wonders of the ancient world that man actually did and then they got credit accredited for those things but then there was what they called the natural wonders of the world and so you had different things and there's there basically seven of them we'll need to go into all of them but there was you know different ones uh we have some African folk with us so they understand along the what is it Zambia and uh Zimbabwe you have the you have the the Victoria Falls maybe somebody knows about those things they're they're there in Africa they have one of the great wonders of the world there's one in in Asia uh called Mount Everest way way high mountain they have one down in in Australia it's called the Great Barrier Reef it's a it's a it's an incredible uh Reef of crustacean it's got some of the most diverse uh fish life and Aquatic Life in the world South America has one it's called Uh guanara Bay it's actually uh they're in Brazil it's got one of the uh one of the other Wonders of the World which is that huge statue of Christ that looks out over the bay you've seen pictures of that well that bay itself actually is a a an inland Bay it's one of the largest in the world of it is the largest uh Inland Bay in the world uh you've got uh uh there's a volcano and volcano in Central and America it's one of them and then one right by my house there's called the Grand Canyon Joe these are what they call wonders of the world there's the seven uh natural wonders of the world they're naturally occurring man didn't have anything to do with it and so they call these the wonders of the world well even those wanders and then there's the one that's Way Way North up here that you see during the winter when it's real cold uh the Aurora Borealis the the northern lights and that's one of the wonders of the world well these things so man has called him the wonders of the world but then they all have some disclaimer that says well you know Mount Everest it's the highest above sea level but from base to Summit there's another one in Hawaii that's actually taller because but you can't see part of it because it's under the water you know so they have this disclaimer well this Bay is this but you know there's another one that's got this and there's all kinds of there's all kinds of disclaimers that that that that come to these things so it's a wonder that they're even a Wonder you know and and then and then of all of them God sends a Vindicated prophet in the last days and he mentions none of them in the message you know except for one and which I thought was striking because the one that he mentions is the Northern Lights and then he applies that in such a way and and I want to read what he what he's what he says there about the Northern Lights because he applies that in such a way so that so he he makes a spiritual application to it the rest of them they were just you know just a hill out there a hole in the ground or you know some water you know but he doesn't really uh deal with it he says I was standing near the North Pole here a few years ago and here I've seen them Northern Lights sweeping yellow green flashes dark midnight would make it as light as it is in this room I walked by I thought Way Down Yonder in Central America where that Compass will point right straight to that magnetic pole and so he's talking about how that there's you know that there's this this this Northern Lights or they're in the North Pole and that's just north and that's basically the the Crux of what he was saying but what's really goes on to say here he says right straight to that magnetic pole it'll guide you North every time and how glorious that that is that we got a magnetic system in glory so so now then so you have what is called the the uh the geographic North Pole then you have what is called the Magnetic North Pole which are slightly different but then brother Brown then begins to talk about this magnetic system that points us to Glory so we actually have what I want to just throw in here a dimensional North and dimensional North is not a direction at all but it's a it's an atmosphere it's a place it's a dwelling it's a it's a it's it's called Heaven it's called home for the believer and he said how glorious that is that we got a magnetic system in glory and every time that has been every man that has been made a compass to to guide through this life will Point towards Jesus Christ just as certain as we're sitting in this church today and so that so that this this this Marvelous Light that we've received in the end time is the person of Jesus Christ and so that when we're born again there's that little Crystal that little that little uh lodestone that was placed in our soul so that every time amen that we we we lose our direction we begin to look at the word of God and it points us back to Jesus Christ every single time it won't lead us astray it won't lead us to the north it won't lead us to Jeffersonville it won't lead us to Johnson City or Flagstaff or Phoenix Arizona or Calgary amen but it will lead us directly to Jesus Christ the word every single time without fail Hallelujah now this Marvelous Light it's wonderful to our eyes now prophet of God here he says look what taken place at that and that was only preparing for this now he's going to enter into a thought here he's going to give us a list and I got some bullet points here I want to hit uh quickly because we're uh running out of time they went out into the Dark Ages 1500 years in the time of Wesley and Luther that sixth time looking out into the church ages he says that that there was a change come when the church was liberated from darkness and was brought into The Marvelous Light of the Gospel again so he's talking about the message now breaking out during the time of the the Azusa Street Revival 1906 coming down which introduced the message of the hour now he said signs and wonders oh God how no man stood and Divine Healing and signs and wonders took place and it was between the sacrifice and the second coming look what taken place then so all this other was a build up for what was going to take place at the end time the stone had been rejected in the days of Christ it had been rejected all the way down through the church ages persecuted martyred burned at the stake devoured by animals the sheepskin and goat skins and lived in caves and nakedness and Peril and of these things the world was not worthy then it comes on down between the sacrifice and the restoration of the Gospel now watch what he says between the sacrifice and the second coming he said look what taken place what's taking place now we're at the end time we're going into the Millennium every hand pointed that way the old clock is ticking away about two minutes until midnight which is in that time it's closer than that now it's only seconds away watch what he says omnipotence is speaking Angels appearing prophets prophesying prophets are coming on the scene Visions being poured out upon the people of the day the gospel is being preached sick is being raised up the blind naturally and spiritually the blind seed the deaf here the devils are raging impersonators Janice and jambres are here oh but omnipotent speaks hallelujah we're in the last days we're at the junction men's hearts are failing for fear it's a perplexity of time distress of Nations Earth is getting nervous it's bursting forth and earthquakes everywhere what's the matter the Earth knows that she's doomed she's nervous the world is nervous but the church is riding in the gospel well think about it it doesn't matter to the church if it blows up the bombs can come the the the whatever that the Earth wants to burst open like a watermelon it doesn't matter because the church are astronauts Hallelujah they've got a spaceship amen they've got a shuttle that'll take them out of this Dimension until the till the Wrath be passed and then he'll bring us back and we'll be on the earth for a thousand years of Peace amen Oh my he can flood it as in the days of the antiluvian it doesn't matter the church is riding in the gospel The Old Ship of Zion we've got an Ark of Safety amen he can burn it with fire it doesn't matter because we're with the Hebrew children Amen in the midst of the fire the fourth man was in the fire with the church Hallelujah oh it doesn't matter what he does why because she's secure writing in the gospel oh my brother Brown tells us that Paul Rader now that Paul Rader that he was he was he'd gone down into the mission Fields And while he was there he got Blackwater fever which is a death sentence and as he was dying he was there he's passing off into a into a coma now we know the story of Paul Raider but I just want to throw something in here that came to me today that Paul wasn't alone he was there with his wife and he told his wife wife keep praying keep crying out to God he told his wife honey it's getting so dark in here said I'm dying and she said oh Paul and she fell on her face and began crying now this is striking to me because everyone thought it was all Paul Raider's faith when she had great faith but remember he wasn't alone his little wife was there in the field with him she began to cry he told her you keep praying I I can't pray no more I've lost my my voice I I can't pray no more he said honey just keep crying keep crying out to God let me hear your voice let somebody pray I can't pray anymore said well I'm dying I want to hear it and she kept crying out to God oh God don't let him die his work isn't finished yet oh God please don't let Paul die she was laying across him like that and so it was her prayers that interceded it didn't matter if he crossed over he said I'm ready to die I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to die but keep praying all that little faith of that little wife she just kept praying he breaks into the dream and he remembers working up in Oregon where he was a logger and he said he was there and he was in the dream and he had cut down a big blog and he he needed to get it over he need to get it back down to camp but it was too big they kept struggling he said but then he heard his boss say why are you struggling Paul so he said I'm just I'm just tired I said but the river's right there just roll it over roll it over into the river Paul and get on it and ride it down to camp he said he rolled it over he said he'd come to himself with his hands up crying out I'm riding on it I'm riding on it completely healed standing in the middle of the room oh my we know the story here's the rest of the story here brother Adam says let him call me whatever they want to I don't care that doesn't matter to me I'm certain that it's God amen it's the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it this is God's day this is God's doing amen you may have trouble today you may be wore out tired you may be struggling you may be going through who knows what everybody has their own battle just get on it roll it into the river that Old River of Life amen he said what is it going to be flowing out of your bellies shall come Rivers of Living Water he said I'm certain that it's of God and I'm riding on it I've been writing on it now brother I'm gave how I think it was 31 years for him I've been riding on it for 40. Hallelujah 40 years I've been riding on it it gets sweeter all the time because I'm nearing the gate and I'm riding on it When Death strikes my body I'll ride on it just keep writing on it I am the resurrection and the lives of God he that believeth on me though yeah he were dead yet shall he live whatsoever live with them whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die I'm riding on it there's nothing uncertain about it I'm writing on it and it's his word and I believe it with all of my heart brother sister I know the trials are hard you want to hear what a Vindicated Prophet said he said I know the trials are hard and I'm getting old and I've preached and I've done everything I know to do I've got to a place where I can see and can't do no more I just laid the whole thing in the lap of the Lord Jesus and I'm riding on it I'm riding on God's purpose on God's promise I the Lord have planted it and I will water it day and night unless some could come and pluck it from my hand amen God's church WIll endure forever the word of God will stand emphatically right forever and regardless if kingdoms come or atomic bombs will fall or America backslides whatever takes place this is his word he keeps it and I'm riding on it I believe it with all of my heart he said when you see these things happen raise up your head your Redemption draweth nigh omnipotence speaks and the miraculous takes place Hallelujah as our musicians come we've always asked ourselves well I want to see a miracle I want to see a miracle well I was a young Christian one time and I wanted to see miracles one day I was kind of disappointed you know it's because you know I heard all the things about brother Branham and so forth I was walking by an old mirror that was hanging on the door the Lord stopped me and said look in that mirror I looked in there he said there's your miracle you ain't joking you know when I began to look at myself I said look at me where I'm standing today I'm a man in my right mind when three months before that I didn't I wasn't in my right mind I was a victim of drug overdose I'd ate so much acid that I was I'd fried my brains I could even carry on a decent conversation slurred speech slobbers running out of my mouth walking up and down the street like a zombie but then Jesus came it was the Lord's doing it was marvelous in her eyes what he did for me I can't even explain it's outside of my human comprehension brother Adam says this and when you become converted from a sinner to a Christian it changes your opinions it changes your will it changes everything that's in you it brings you into another life it gives you another spirit that bears forth another record who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed that's the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our sight he goes on he said omnipotence has spoke it spoke to my heart and spoke to your heart the miraculous was done once a little cowardly sinner maybe like you did a drunkard a cigarette smoker a runner dances and carrying on like that but omnipotent spoke and he received it and the miraculous was done you change from Death To Life and forsaken your sins omnipotent spoke and the miraculous was done certainly it's about our hearts father this evening Lord we we have to say as the psalmists this is the day the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it omnipotence has spoken we were yet dead in sin and trespassed we were we were living in pleasure and dead while we yet live but omnipotence spoke the miraculous took place and this is marvelous in our eyes it's marvelous this is a day despised and rejected your Prophet said that she has been despised and rejected of men there is no Beauty we would desire in her Lord we're that little bride that little that little despised and rejected Church cut out from the world but you said we would be a peculiar people and we would be a a holy nation the rest of the world is turned over to reprobate minds and fornicating spirits and Evil all the way down into little children loss of identity loss of common sense but Lord your little bride she's she's rising up into the into the Ethereal Realms where she can see that all things are possible Lord she's grasping onto every Pentecostal promise that the skies are are full of Lord to to see the supernatural done in their own lives Lord help these your children tonight Lord I I commit them into your care Lord that they would that they would know you in the power of your Resurrection that they will be prepared for your very soon and imminent coming Lord that they would know you Lord that they would forsake the things of the world and or they would cleave to the cross or until they're trophies they would all lay down they would still cling to The Old Rugged Cross we love you Lord tonight may you bless your church I pray bless our dear pastor Lord officers of this assembly Lord each and every one every mother and father every young person Lord every single person Lord that's Lord that's able to keep themselves holy unto you Lord to serve you without distractions Lord help them Lord we love them give you all

filled with music with all my heart I see I know [Music] that's Darkness Hallelujah [Music] [Music] this can't help but think about that story brother Branham tells when I sing that song the reason I sing it is because I just can't help but think of that story but the random tells about being in that in that in that restaurant where he sees the the woman the ill-famed woman right the two lawmen and how he sees that Vision he's judging them and ask God to to to Smite them to judge them and and God says you know what there's a bumper of blood and you know he sees that vision and he says whose sins are those and he says those are yours the prophet of God those are your sins and if it weren't for that bumper of blood if it weren't for that cross of calvary some place for your sins to be hid my goodness that's why I like singing that that's why I sing that so much I just think about that you know um can we sing in Christ alone as we're dismissed tonight remember the service on Sunday pray for brothers brother uh Dale he's going up to for the Jerry Furies I believe Sunday evening he'll be preaching there we certainly want to remember him there and trust it the Lord will look after his congregation while he's gone uh yeah it'll be the Lord's doing be marvelous in our eyes In Christ Alone will I Glory though I could pride myself in battle's world before I've been blessed beyond measure and my history [Music] oh I could stop account successes like diamonds in my hands but those trophies [Music] good way s by which I stand in Christ the lord I place my trust I find my glory in the power of the Gods in every Victory [Music] is Christ Alone will I glory for only by his grace [Music] but now I see no greater honor than just know you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] it cries [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just remember the service on Sunday as well brother Gilbert will take it here we're traveling to Saskatoon trust that the Lord will do something wonderful
