heard that you are more willing to meet the desires of our hearts Lord when they're according to your word a thousand times more than we're willing to receive it father Lord Jesus tonight I pray that you would hear our prayers father Lord that you would meet our needs father we are a needy people you created us that way father the world tries to teach us that we're successful and that we're Achievers and that we do all these things in this world but father what we need is more of you not more things Lord not more successes or achievements father Lord we need more of you because we know this age needs more faith than any other age Lord Jesus you've allowed this age to get seven times hotter than every other age Lord but you had a people raised up for this situation and father tonight we stand here with our hands raised unto you saying thank you Lord for choosing us to be the ones who get to stand here at the End of Time father we pray that you would meet every need made known unto

that you would just speak to us tonight father that we would just surrender ourselves to your word father Lord that we wouldn't be looking for a man's idea or a Creed or a Dogma but Lord that we would be looking for the manifestation of the full word revealed to us individually Lord father we pray that you would just be glorified now with every aspect of this service every word that's spoken Lord other as we go forwards now we commit this service entirely into your hands thank you for meeting each and every need according to your will we ask all these things now in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] Hallelujah we just have uh scripture I'd like to read tonight thank you musicians a little bit of a different direction but uh just trust the Lord will bless it if you'll turn with me to Daniel chapter 3. very familiar story don't know how much time we'll have to get into it but we'll see God bless you tonight certainly wonderful to have everyone here even our visitors we trust the Lord blesses you abundantly Daniel chapter 3. we'll start with verse one Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plane of dura in the province of Babylon the Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges and the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then and Harold cried aloud to you it is commanded o people Nations and languages that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet the flute heart sackbut sultry dulcimer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so falleth not down and worshipeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbutt Sultry and all kinds of music all the people the Nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews now note I just want to make a note here they didn't accuse the Jews to the Jews they went behind their back to the king verse 9 they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever thou Old King has made a decree that every man shall every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbutt Sultry and dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso falleth not down and worshipeth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews whom now has set over the Affairs of the provinces of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men O King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up the Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they brought these men before the king Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if ye be ready at that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbutt Sultry and dulcimer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace was exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonied and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men Bound in the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true O King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth like the son of God let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this word this story Lord we know that you have a purpose for it and father we thank you for the courage of those three young men Lord that they wouldn't bow down father that they wouldn't be careful to speak to the king because they knew the king and father we just want to commit this service now into your hands father that you would just speak to us about this story father and Lord that you would just say the words that you once said and you would stop the words that you don't father and we'll be careful to give you all the praise we love you we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we just had two praise reports which I wanted to mention before we get into the service tonight I think it's beautiful sister Marion wants to thank the Lord for Journey Mercies back from Nairobi Kenya and the church in Nairobi also sends their greetings and I believe that's brother Wycliffe is it at the moringa School yeah we had a service there uh just a tremendous group of Believers there we're certainly thankful for what the Lord's done in sister Marion and brother tabiso's lives the Lord has certainly worked a wonderful thing there and I'm very interested to hear the uh the report from your auntie sister um for anyone that is curious about that this sister has a story about serving the lord and I think it would be tremendous somehow someway we need to get a microphone on a camera in front of her and and let her tell her story of her husband he is uh he has has been I'll say it this way not a very nice man over the years um he has treated her very very poorly but you know what that has not given her license to actually change her own testimony about the grace of the Lord Jesus in her life she has prayed the blessing upon her family upon her husband and continues to do so even while her husband abuses her verbally and physically while he drinks he has not been a very nice man but she has not changed not wavered her testimony one iota and you know the Lord has answered prayers in ways that maybe sometimes we don't even understand sometimes we can ask for a prayer and the Lord will allow us to go through a valley he'll allow us to go through a circumstance or a situation and and that will be to see how we come out the other side and and we will come out the other side we will actually prove that we are Sons and Daughters of God even in the midst of great trial but it's a tremendous story I would certainly love it if your auntie could come to Canada just let her give a testimony it would be tremendous but uh anyways if you're talking to her just say greetings from your church here sister we also have a praise report from Sister Elaine who uh she lost the ring and uh it's a very special ring it was an anniversary ring I understand and uh it's a very special ring and uh she didn't know where it was for two and a half weeks and the family in the church said you know what we understand this problem and and we'll pray for you sister Elaine didn't tell anyone else she didn't tell her husband it was a gift from her husband for their anniversary she didn't tell anybody because it it it's serious you certainly don't want to lose something like that and and say that you've lost it but she committed it to the Lord we know that the word of God says that if any two can agree on asking for anything that the Lord will grant it to them and and that's actually happened that that that happened sister Elaine was actually looking in her file cabinet and she heard a clunk and she found the Ring The Ring was there now many people would say well she probably just had it on her finger and it just slipped off and fell in there because she's busy at work and you know that's the way life happens and we can just explain everything away can't we who's to say that that ring didn't follow it on the ground somewhere at a store or somewhere else we know we're dealing with a little bit of a different age here and you ask God for anything and there's nothing that he will hold back from you if it's according to his word so we just want to give God the praise for that because we don't know where that ring really was some people will say Well it had to be in the filing cabinet all along and that's fine some people will say that but you never know where it was God knows and one day we'll look back and say thank you Lord but we don't have to wait till we get somewhere to do that we can give him the praise and the glory here so God bless you Sister Elaine and sister Marion for your praise reports I believe he loves to hear it I believe that the body of Believers love to hear it because it's an encouragement to us we serve a living God are you happy tonight I just want to talk about Daniel and and this story about the the fiery furnace and before we get into that there's a few announcements we have the ladies brunch it's coming up on the 16th and I believe it's 10 30 a.m uh if you have any questions about that please just reach out to Sister Lisa we have the Youth Event coming up after service on the 10th and it's going to start at two o'clock and end at five o'clock it will be at the Claussen acreage uh Thursday the 14th we're going to have a prayer meeting at 7 30 at the church here it's always a good time for prayer and testimonies Sunday the 17th at 6 PM we'll have a communion service so uh maybe just make sure we Mark these down in our calendars it's on the actual Church calendar as well Wednesday September the 28th we're going to have brother James new Van de Bandy here and uh I'm trusting it'll be a wonderful time the Lord will certainly move I did send out a text message um for brother Andrew I'm sure that everyone got it and uh understands the the situation I sent it to the brothers but uh yeah brother Andrews being led by the Lord for anybody that doesn't know brother Andrew he's here tonight he uh was here on a work situation from Newfoundland into the Northwest Territories and he was forced to bug out because of the fires they evacuated everyone and he wound up in Calgary with his job and believer of this message he looked for a church and found this church here and so here he finds himself in Calgary and the employer in Newfoundland decided to terminate his employment so now he's just at large and he's not quite sure what to do he feels led to attend here I suggested that we look at the service you know the choosing of a bride by the prophet in our day we know that that's a powerful message not so much about finding a wife but finding a place where you can be spiritually fed and if we can do that I believe the Lord will just pour out a blessing that we can't even really contain so just pray for brother Andrew I believe that someone has already stepped up to the plate to help out brother Andrew we'll certainly talk about that afterwards but if anybody does have anything they can do to help please reach out you know healing comes through the body encouragement comes through the body it's a wonderful thing to be a part of a body talking about our story tonight I think it's just wonderful how we can see the the the progression of of this story and you know before we really even get into this I think it's important to just take a look at the maybe a little bit of the story of how this all unfolded and uh bear with me for a second here I just think it's it's it's interesting to look at the background story of this not just so much that you know at the time the king set up the image and and the children were told to come and bow before this image and we know that we refer to them as children but they were young men they weren't just little children that were unattended without parents the Hebrew kids were were Sons and Daughters of God sons of God um but there was probably many people that were carried away that's why I say Sons and Daughters of God it wasn't just uh men I believe there was a bunch of people that were taken away and they were taken away by Nebuchadnezzar the king of of Babylon and we know that he came and he sacked Jerusalem he destroyed the city and he was merciless he was ruthless and cold he went through and killed and destroyed aimlessly he he saved the Smart Ones though he saved the ones who were educated the ones who actually had skill and talent he did take those and and led them captive into his land of Babylon but you know while he was there in Jerusalem he was ruthless he was he was actually told not to spare a life not to have pity on anyone and that's actually the words of the Lord if you go back into the book of Jeremiah and read what God was saying to Jerusalem to the inhabitants of this city it's not like God just allowed this amazingly terrible uh Misfortune to fall upon the city of Jerusalem they were warned and they were warned and they were warned not just over and over again by Jeremiah they had Ezekiel there to warn them and tell them guys get back to Christ get back to the word forget about the formal Traditions that we have forget about all the man's ideas that we have half get back to the word of God get straight with that word and over and over again what did they do they destroyed the prophets they dismissed the prophets they insulted the prophets they treated the prophets poorly they said we don't have to listen to you because look at we've got everything that we need we've got these Great Walls of security everything that we need is is right here for us we don't have to worry about listening to this who is this guy he's a fanatic we know his parents we know where he came from he's just another another human being just like the rest of us and he goes and makes himself special saying that he's a prophet of God but you know not very many people have the courage to go and put their finger in the face of a king and say thus saith the Lord not many people but Isaiah did and Jeremiah did and so did Ezekiel and all the rest of the prophets get back to the word stay straight on that word and what did they do they dismissed them and so you know what God had nothing but to follow through with his prophecy he told them exactly what would happen if you don't listen to me I'm going to send the King of the North and he's going to March into your city and destroy it and you because they didn't listen that's what he did did exactly that didn't he that's where these boys in in our story come from that's the the situation the the background sort of of what happened and you know when that happened they they were taken because they were healthy they were taken because they were smart they were able to actually be used for some Purpose By The King and we know that the only reason the king wanted them was because God wanted to do something with them it's not just because Nebuchadnezzar wanted something done nothing happens unless God wants it done that that's that's the truth of the matter God wanted these boys saved and God wanted these boys to get right beside the king not just be saved but you know going back in the story right to the beginning of Daniel one of the first things that happened to them when they were actually taken into captivity one of the first things that they did to them is they renamed them they took their old names and said forget about your names that's what your parents called you you're the son of so-and-so no you're not you're the son of Nebuchadnezzar now this is your new name forget about your old life forget about all of your old traditions now even your language that means nothing now you're going to learn the new language you're going to to learn all of the new customs and traditions and you're going to be a brand new person and and if you don't want that then we'll just kill you that's all you can make your choice and so that was the first thing that they did was they were renamed it was Michelle Azariah and and hananiah Shadrach Meshach and Abednego I didn't say it the right way had an eye it was Shadrach Michelle was Meshach and Azariah was Abednego their names were changed it was a psychological method to reprogram them to reprogram their thinking to give them a little bit of Amnesia about who they were and I just can't help but think about this psychological method to reprogram their thinking take a look at at our lives in the world that we live in brothers and sisters you know even if we just look at it at a carnal level at a human level when we thought about our lives as children how did you see yourself and how do you see yourself today many of the children would say well I see myself exactly like a child and I get that but you'll find out children that when you get to be old like me or or some of the other people in the congregation that you will not see yourself the exact same way and some of it is because of learning and maturity but some of it is because of the way this world treats us the situations and and and circumstances that we have to go through it changes the way we see ourselves it changes the way we feel about ourselves and sometimes it can even change the way we talk about ourselves not to other people necessarily but it to ourselves that self-talk now some people might say brother Barry now you're really getting psychological but you know what we do have a voice inside of our head and if we're not careful we'll be listening to the wrong one the one we want to listen to is the one that actually lines up with the word of God now I'm saying it because I've experienced complexes anybody else here ever had a complex you don't have to raise your hand but you know what I'm talking about we get situations in our lives maybe where we're mistreated in a certain circumstance and will never ever allow ourselves to be in that situation again because of the level of embarrassment or or fear or whatever it is that we encountered you can't say that that's not a psychological thing it is but we're not preaching psychology we're preaching a God that can heal a mind that he can heal a body and he can save a soul he's the creator of the entire body and all of those are parts of the body but this is what they were going through a psychological method to change them into different people and I just got thinking about this you know don't we live in a world that's like that we go through a psychological method to reprogram ourselves into different people and and we we go from being children where we have just maybe a happy life and sometimes our lives are happy all the way along but sometimes we have circumstances where we go from the innocence of a child to a terrible World call it a a Babylon experience with a king Nebuchadnezzar and will say the devil in place of Nebuchadnezzar that's ruthless that has no care or concern for our emotions or our well-being or our feelings that wants to destroy us but you know what we have Angels encountered about those who fear Him so he can't touch us he can't destroy us but he can mold us and shape us and we can be assured that God will allow him God will tell the Nebuchadnezzar of today I want you to mold these children because it's going to bring forth my purpose it's going to change them into the way that I want them to be we know that that that brother Branham said it very clearly to us and I'm sure other people have said it too the only thing that we're going to take with us to the other side is our character and the character that we have when we leave this world it's not a gift we can't just say that someone gave me this great character I had such an amazing mother and and my father was so good they were both so successful and they did such wonderful things for the whole entire world and I have those genetics and so I'm going to take their character that blend with me no that's not the way it works is it it's it's what molds us and shapes us it's it's that refiners fire it's that metal that gets heated up pulled out and beaten and then heated up and pulled out and beaten and folded and heated up and pulled out and beaten and folded and continually done that way that's what's gonna happen until he sees his image in that metal brothers and sisters that's what we're dealing with that's that's what's Happening Here but will never be destroyed we'll be beaten down maybe a little bit but we'll never be destroyed remember we've said it we I remember brother Ken saying it you know we're either we're either up or we're getting up but we're never down never completely down but here we have a name and I just think it's important looking at this this scripture here tonight the story that we've read if we're not careful sometimes we can acquire a little bit of a different name in our own minds we can develop a little bit of a complex and we know that we're Sons and Daughters of God that's what the word of God says but the devil is going to tell us no you're not you're a failure you should have done this or or no you're not you're a cheater you actually did this wrong you you go you you could have done it different but you never did and unless we deal with those things properly brothers and sisters they're going to be there in the back of our mind and Satan's always going to have that voice but boy oh boy when that time appointed of the father comes that we can just drive it down we can deal with that problem properly we can eliminate that entire voice from our minds sometimes we can have a complex about our identity and that's what they wanted to do to the children here in in in the Book of Daniel the very beginning and you know it's interesting because they had already learned about the Lord they had already been taught about the ways of this gospel they knew exactly who they were when they went into Babylon I think it's beautiful in in in Daniel chapter 1 one of the next things that happened to them after their names were changed they had a name change one of the next things that happened was they said you know what now you're no longer in your land you get to eat the best food the most organic food out of every single province in the Kingdom nobody has food as good as the King's food and you're going to eat it and and everyone else in the country said sure we'll eat it even the brothers and sisters the ones who were Jews they ate this food but there was a few that said nope we won't touch this food because we know that it's unclean it's sacrificed unto Idols it's killed the wrong way it's the wrong meat we can't eat this meat we can't eat this food we know that that's what males are the the the the the steward for the king he came and told them that's what you're going to do everyone's gonna do it so get on board and they stood up there and said nope we're not doing it we're not gonna we're just gonna starve if that's what we got to do but you know what they said they said prove thy servants I beseech thee 10 days and let them give us just pulse to eat and we know that that's a grain just just a a vegetable just just a a green vegetable just grind it up and eat it with water just give us this pulse to eat with the water and and just see if our countenances don't look good and you know what they did they were proving God in that moment they were saying that we don't serve a god of our imagination we serve a living God you didn't just bring children of Israel here you brought the god of Israel here is what they were telling the steward of the king and and he must have been miffed he must have been mystified at this situation he was really concerned because he said hey you know what I can't mess around with this the king said to feed you the best and if I don't feed you the best and now there's a problem what's gonna happen is he's gonna take my head off because this is a king that's ruthless you got to understand this so what he did was he took a real big chance and you can imagine that there was an anointing that came around that man those boys had some prayer for that anointing to come down but we know that they said that our accountances be looked on in 10 days come back and see and we know that the end of ten days their countenances appeared bad fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of of the king's meat so there was other Jews that were eating all of that perfectly organic beautiful best of the country food and their countenances didn't Prosper nearly as much as these three that committed it to the Lord isn't that interesting and you know what happened after that the steward of the king melzar he took away the portion of the meat and the and the wine that all of these other Jews were drinking and said give them pulse look what it does to them can you imagine that they went from living high on the hog to eating pulse just like the believer it's beautiful but that's the way God does it isn't it he just wants to be proved he's just waiting for us to say prove yourself God we just want you to prove yourself God we're not looking for signs or wonders but when the circumstances and situations come up when Nebuchadnezzar tries to tell us this is how it's going to be we're gonna say no it ain't we're going to serve the god of Heaven we're going to serve the God of this word we're not going to serve the God of this land verse 17 of of chapter 1 says as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams it's just beautiful to look at these children how they came in and immediately they stood out and what made them Stand Out brothers and sisters this is what really encourages me it's it's what I need remember when I talk like this I'm preaching to myself I'm I'm getting encouragement out of this what changed them what set them apart from everyone else is they weren't afraid to stand up for the testimony of this word they weren't afraid to stand in their positions because they know their God they knew their God they knew exactly who they were we know then we go into chapter two and and the next one was the king had the dream remember the dream and and Daniel gives the interpretation of it but first the king says you know what let's let's call in all the musicians or the The Magicians and the and the wise men and the sorcerers let's get everyone in here and tell me this dream I can't believe that I had this dream and they all came in at the command of the king and the King says you know tell me what's going on here and they say well first king just just tell us the dream and and then we'll be able to help you we'll be able to give you the interpretation he's like if you're not magicians and Sorcerers you tell me the dream you give me the interpretation it's gone from me I don't know why we pay you guys who are you guys why are you even here you call yourself a sorcerer or a magician tell me the interpretation of it in fact if you don't tell me the interpretation of it then what's going to happen this was his Hallmark for the people that he cared for that he loved that your families will be killed and your houses will be turned into dunghills this was the king they were serving can you imagine that but Daniel he took a different approach didn't he he stood up he stood up and he said you know O King live forever just give us a little bit of time just give me a little bit of time in prayer alone with my God just just let me have a conversation with him let us go have a little prayer meeting and and we'll just see if we can't actually tell you and we know the story we know it well he went had the prayer meeting came back and and after Consulting the god of Heaven he told them exactly what the dream was he told them exactly what the interpretation was thereof and we know because of that all of them were appointed to the highest positions in the land and you know brothers and sisters that's where we start our story tonight and we're only like half an hour praise the Lord I just think it's so beautiful this story is amazing when you think about it because here they are these children they're they're taken from their land they're they're told all these different things that they have to do and they just won't bow down for a second not one thing will cause them to change their countenance not one thing will change their testimony and did not God reward them took them to the highest position in the land and now when they're in the highest position of the land that's why I wanted to point it out brothers and sisters it's not like they were just part of all the other children of Israel that came out of the land in captivity you would have to imagine it would be real easy for the rest of them to be able to just hide and and not really shine not really be visible but these ones were governing the provinces of the land I can only imagine that they were on a bit of a Podium with some of the other leaders and and judges and and and rulers of the lands so when it came time for them to follow the instructions of the king to bow down to this image they stood out you know I just can't help but think brothers and sisters we're coming to that place rapidly very rapidly where we're going to stand out way more than we do now a lot of the sisters stand out but you know we're coming to the place where we're going to be told if you don't believe it this way there's going to be a problem and and you know I think it'll be beautiful because we'll all of a sudden just like that we'll all be a whole lot more alike than we are different all of these fences that we had talked about will disappear you know where I brought a quote when I was in Saskatoon when we drove North to Edmonton the the fields up there are just tremendous the crops are huge north of Red Deer onwards there's corn crops there I bet you they're about eight feet tall they're ginormous I didn't think you could grow corn like that here but you know there's a quote that brother Branham talks about about an aviator flying a plane and and how he looked down and he could see the different crops and the different fields and and the fences dividing it and he said you know what happens The Aviator said this I guess to brother Brown what happens is eventually those crops grow up and when those crops grow up and mature they actually cover over the fences and you can't see the fences all you see is one big crop of corn and brother badam says I think that's the way it is with the church today I think it's exactly like that we just need to mature a little bit and as we mature all of these little offenses these little things these pet doctrines that get in the way of our lives our maturity they'll just disappear as we mature because we'll all just be one crop and we know that's what it is it's one body it's one bride of Jesus Christ it's not multi-brides all over the place it's one bride but going back to our story here [Music] the uh Hebrew Boys in uh in the fiery furnace we know that they were they were given the opportunity even first they were identified by the accusers the accusers oh they caught them red-handed they weren't falling down at this image and and I'd like to get into the image a little bit you know brother Branham said what that image was the whole entire world runs after the idea that that image was an image of Nebuchadnezzar but it took a prophet to actually say hold on a second boys where does it say in the Bible that that was an image of Nebuchadnezzar that was an image that Nebuchadnezzar created it was a golden image but that image was actually of this man the prophet and isn't it interesting that it was that man the prophet and isn't it interesting that these Hebrew children that stood on their testimony real strong would not bow down to the image of the prophet because as soon as you do that you make that profit Antichrist but here we have these Hebrew children they're not interested in bowing down to an image of a man at all they're only interested in bowing down to the image of the Lord Jesus Christ and that is the word and you know when they actually were told to come and talk to the king get up here we want to talk to you I I thought it was real interesting I was having a conversation with someone a while back about this you know and these Hebrew children raced to the highest positions in the land they understood a whole lot about dealing with the King they understood what it meant to stand in the king's court you only addressed the king when you were told to address the king you only spoke to the king a very certain way you did not just hang out and do whatever you wanted to do it was exactly the way Nebuchadnezzar wanted it and isn't it interesting to think that those ones that were the highest position of the land they said King O King live forever but we're not going to be careful how we answer you we're not going to be careful every other time they would be careful how they answered that King because their lives would depend upon it but this time it doesn't matter what you say doesn't matter what you do we're not going to be careful we're going to tell you the truth we're going to speak this word we're going to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to you today you know out of an absolute 1963-0304 the Hebrew children they would be thrown into a fiery furnace that would be burned with heat seven times hotter than the furnace had ever had that Hebrew children believed God they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this furnace why they had an absolute they had the word of God and the god that could deliver them Hebrew children from the death cell of a fiery furnace how much more can he deliver this little Jewish boy out here that's laying Yonder in a death cell how much more is he and he's still the same Jehovah God that he always was and I want to say this if that's the case brothers and sisters then he's still the same Jehovah God that could deliver any one of us out of any one of these death cells that we get ourselves into any one of the fiery furnaces that we encounter in our lives he's the same same God many times we'll say the same yesterday today and forever but the round says it here and he's still the same Jehovah God that he always was we like the Apostle Paul can realize that same God lives today yesterday today and forever the same then Christians can hold on to God's unchanging hand and change the whole situation Prayer Changes Things that's what we want to do I just want to throw this out there brothers and sisters this last little part here we're able to hold God's unchanging hand and change the whole situation if we want to Prayer Changes Things Satan wants to tell us we're too busy Satan wants to tell us we've had Church four times this month maybe five or six Satan wants to tell us we don't get anything out of it anyways how do you know I was talking to someone earlier and we're talking about prayer we're talking about tithing we're talking about our behavior and we've said it in the past but I'll say it tonight brothers and sisters that our actions today aren't are access towards God aren't just like uh the lives that we live where we have instant gratification on social media or an instant return on an email that we're eager to get a response from or or someone picking up the phone our prayers work in a different way our prayers will be answered every single time but it might be some time and it might not even be us that receives the blessing from those prayers it might be our children that receive the blessings for our prayers oh my or our lack thereof don't let life stand in the way of prayer brothers and sisters I say Lord help me help me I don't want to act I'm not trying to portray A Perfect Image here brothers and sisters I don't pray as much as I would like to as much as I feel like I should and I would say pray for me that that would change in my life because I believe there's a tremendous opportunity in prayer you know brother Bradham said that's the greatest weapon that the Christian has don't get me wrong it's not like I don't pray I do pray but I always feel like I should pray more we know that Paul says to pray without ceasing and that wasn't just Paul that was God speaking through Paul I just think this story tonight is so beautiful on so many different levels to think that they would just say to the king you know what it doesn't matter what you think we're just not going to be careful to answer you we're going to speak our minds you're going to hear the whole truth we're not going to shun to declare the entire gospel unto you tonight but it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the the accusers coming to them directly was it they didn't just come to them and say you know what you know you know you need to be doing this you better get down and and worship this image no they went right to the king they went right for the juggler and what did they do they pushed his buttons didn't they they pushed his buttons in such a way that it caused rage and fury to come up in the king they knew exactly how to get them going and that's exactly what they did but we know that even though he took and made that furnace seven times harder he could have made it 20 times hotter than it wouldn't have mattered brother Branham says somewhere and one of the quotes that you know how hot it was you couldn't get within a hundred yards of that furnace 100 yards of that furnace or it would burn you up and remember it was the most Valiant men of the army of the military that the king chose and while they carried them up there what happened to them they fried because it was hot it was real hot and I just can't help but think the parallel brothers and sisters that's where we are today isn't it spiritually speaking the furnace has been stoked seven times hotter we know that Satan is is going about as a roaring lion seeing whom he can devour but we know that we have a prophet in our day that said he's toothless he doesn't have teeth but he's going about to see who he can destroy who he can actually get after and he doesn't care he's ruthless just like this King Nebuchadnezzar but we know that all of the spirits are against us oh my it's hot spiritually speaking brothers and sisters it is a hot day spiritually speaking all of the spirits the lid of hell was taken off is what brother Branham said and here we are standing in the midst of that fiery furnace and we know that as we stand in the midst of this furnace there is a fourth one in the fire and you know we have the opportunity to know him and isn't it beautiful we look at this story I'm kind of bouncing all over the place I hope it's okay I'm just preaching tonight but to look at this story and think that you know what it tells that when they went into the fire they had all of their garments on all of them shouldn't all of it have burnt but not one hair on their body was singed we know that not one part of their garment had a little coal mark on it or a little tiny burn mark and and it didn't even have the smell of smoke when they came out of that furnace and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters we have all been given Robes of his righteousness there's not one of us that are going to come out the other side with a burn from this fire from from this seven times hotter fire not one of us will come out that way in 1963 remembering the Lord Brother Brown I'm talking about this story he says then we could call another group of people or at least I'd say three and they were Shadrach Meshach and Abednego how that they had took their stand for God remembering that he keeps his promise I want to say that tonight brothers and sisters just remember he keeps his promise it's not up to us to activate his promise he keeps his promise and how that in this great hour because of their stand even their own Brethren many of them had turned off into the world I I just I could talk about that but but they were going to stand regardless and they took a stand for God and when the furnace was hit seven times hotter than it was ever hit before and they was pushed into this furnace see they didn't want to go into the furnace did they they were pushed into it I don't think any one of us wanted to be in the spiritual furnace did we were pushed into it we're pushed into it because we make a stand and in the midst of it we can make a stand and I think it's beautiful in this story it shows that they were thrown in and that they fell into it but somehow they were standing in the midst of the Flames they were standing with that fourth one even though they fell and they can certainly remember that Fourth Man was there with them that kept all the Heat and death away from them there's something about that Fourth Man might talk about him a while yes sir how that he was the only one could make that possible can you think about that for a sec how you could just be in the midst of a furnace like that so hot how on Earth is that even possible it just defies all nature it's 100 percent Supernatural isn't it but this is a story this is a real story We believe this to be an actual account of human beings an attempted destruction of the Bride of Jesus Christ he was the only one that could make that possible and he's the only one that can make it possible for us today brothers and sisters there was no other person could do it but that Fourth Man and he was the one that provided life in the jaws of death amen and he kept the fire blazes back and preserved them can you imagine what it would be like to be thrown on the fire and think that you know what we just we're gonna stand on this word I was just meditating on this those those Hebrew kids uh you know what we're gonna die today that's what's gonna happen because that's the king that we serve the king that we've been forced to come and serve he is going to do us in today and you know what he's going to make the furnace seven times hotter guys so I guess it'll be seven times faster that will die we'll burn up can you imagine what it'd be like to walk the plank with those men those Mighty Men and to see them fall and scream from the Heat and and they fall down and die and as they fall down and die they push shove you in and as you go in you wind up landing on the ground probably felt like a a air cushion or something not a hard ground but an air cushion something that would just be soft and give you the ability to wonder what just happened aren't I supposed to be dead aren't I supposed to be in the fire look at those guys that threw us in they're dead out there and look at everyone else they're looking so intently at us inside this furnace but but here we are are we supposed to be thinking like this when we're dead is this what being dead feels like I've never been in a fire every time I've gone close to fire it really hurts look at those men laying there it must have really hurt them but here we are inside this fire we're still alive can you hear me yeah I can hear you can you hear me yeah shouldn't we be dead and then oh my to see someone else there in that fire to see the one that looks like the son of man in that fire can you imagine that to look at it and think that somehow all of this is defying logic how could this possibly be and then to have the king come and say you come out my goodness and he kept the fire blazes back and preserved them and oh as long as there can be a memory and it'll Never Fade Out so that they can remember that great day down in Babylon brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us when the fires come up around us when we see it we've got to walk into that furnace there's times where we'll have to where we can't escape it he will be there in that fire he won't be a moment too late he will be there exactly when we need him there present stage of my Ministry in 1962. yes it was the Hebrew children under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar when they wouldn't bow to the image I just think it's beautiful as we read this you know how I just we know that there's an account given in heaven for all of this exactly the way it is the way it is written and and the way that it's experienced in our lives he says yes it was the Hebrew children under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar when they wouldn't bow to the image they stayed true to the god to God because God's word said don't bow before any image to worship it they stayed true to the word I think it's so critical for us to stay true to the word we don't want to put any man we don't want to put any Ministry including a prophet on a pedestal we understand the prophetic office we understand the offices according to the word but nobody deserves worship except for God remember John in the Book of Revelation when he was caught up into heaven when he saw that door open and he went up a little higher when he was there two times in the Book of Revelations while he was there in that other dimension he tried to worship an angel and that angel told him no John see thou do it not because I'm just your fellow servant I'm just a man just like you just worship God just worship God he's the one that deserves all of our worship they stayed true to God because God's word said don't bow before any image to worship it they stayed true to the word and it was in the local paper in the news all about it whatever it was in them days they had ways to scatter news not in a local newspaper of course not just saying that so you'll have some idea but it was there was going to burn them in the fiery furnace seven times hotter sounds like they made a spectacle out of it sounds like they really wanted to make it a bit of a festival they're going to make an example out of them don't don't don't embarrass the king don't don't don't cross him but here they were but it was in there they was going to burn them in the fiery furnace seven times hotter for days before that they thrown in all the material to get that furnace so hot that it was seven times hotter overheated seven times why it would have consumed them to get in a hundred yards of it but they went right in the fiery furnace and come right out without even any smell of fire on them and Nebuchadnezzar said every man that fails to worship this God let his children and him be killed his house burned and made a dung Hill his Hallmark the way that he likes to make an example of people what a tyrant that's right see they had a worldwide Revival because they were true to the word that's what happens yes sir stay true to the word yes and it always pays out wonderful I just have been so encouraged by even this quote alone brothers and sisters just to stay true to the word and and watch it start a Revival Watch people get encouraged by it and some people get discouraged by it you know what it's not up to us to to bring people in or or put people out it's up to us to stay true to the word and let the word do the Sorting because it's the word of God that's sharper than any two-edged sword it's not the man it's not up to the man to do that and uh yeah I think it's just beautiful and we can stay true to that word just say what the prophet said that's all we got to do we heard brother Andrew Glover say it just say what the prophet said I think it's so beautiful how he heard that did he talk about that testimony from Brother Wayne was that in person or was that from the pulpit I'll tell it from the pulpit though I think it's so beautiful when he was starting in his ministry he was like how do I preach to the people how do I get the the Mysteries to people how do I get this richness out to the people of the message of the hour and he said you want to speak something new you want to preach something new you just preach what the prophet said because most people aren't doing that anymore I thought wow that's incredible just preach what the prophet said because people don't do that anymore they want to put a spin on it and have an edge on it and try and make it something different that's not what it is brothers and sisters that's going to lead us into destruction what the prophet said is what the word said because he said you know what I preach what Paul preached that's that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here we know that Paul said it twice in the word if if if me or an angel ever come and say anything different to this word then let him be accursed if we try and put our own spin on that's going to bring destruction out of paradox in 61 brother Branham said it was a paradox when the Hebrew children that had decided they would stay with God's word remember the Paradox is something that's incredible but yet it's true and I want to say tonight each one of you are a paradox brothers and sisters because you have the ability to believe this word that's incredible but it's true regardless of what happened that the king built the furnace seven times hotter than it ever had been had and throw those men in there where the intense Heat Of The Furnace killed the men who walked up the Gangplank with them to the mouth of the Furnace they died but yet those men walked in the furnace for perhaps three hours got me wondering about that whole story that I just talked about and you know one part of it could you imagine what it would be like to to fall into it and and poof the coals go up the hotter coals who knows what they use to make the fire but to think you've got them on you you'd be jumping around maybe because you know what's happening but yet you're defying all nature God is defying all nature with you and to maybe just pick up a call and look at it pick up a log burning and look at it maybe hot red hot rocks and look at them and think man this is something hey had three hours in there could it be my I wonder what they talked about I wonder what the Fourth Man In The Fire said to them but yet those men walked in the furnace for perhaps three hours there would be no more even dust of them for the human life that was in them would have perished if it made one human life perish by coming close to it what would it do another human life but they throwed them in there and let's say three hours it might have been five he might have went and had lunch and come back and said open up the furnace door there won't even be dust of them fellows left can you imagine that kind of reminds me of the story of Daniel it's no different than Daniel and and one of the things that he encountered with another king he was told no praying and wasn't it the accusers that went to the king and wrote the ordinance and and did the whole trick for him and he said hey you know what I'm not changing one iota I'm gonna stay exactly the way that I've been I'm gonna pray morning noon and night every single day and in fact I'll roll up my blinds and you can actually see me in my house and that's what I'm gonna do and he did it and we know the King was his friend but the king couldn't change the word could it he couldn't change the law that was the law once the law was wrote you can't change it at all so Daniel he went into the lion's den and this man while he was in there we know the angel of the Lord another man came and closed the mouth of the Lions but what happened to the accusers in that situation it's a pretty sad story when you consider it because it says it very clearly in the word of God that it wasn't just the accusers it was the accusers their wives and their children were thrown into those lions and those Lions they overpowered them those Lions consumed that whole group of people that's the Mighty God that we serve he says here in this quote anyways he might have went and had lunch and come back and said open up the furniture store there won't even be dust for them fellows left but when he opened the door there they were unharmed walking around in that fire incredible but true paradox why he said how many did you put in they said we had put three in he said but I see four that's what made the paradox and that one looks like the son of Gods he wasn't a son of the Gods he was the son of God and they were heathens oh God in his great word I just think tonight brothers and sisters this story here it just really speaks to me in that here they were told to just obey the king just do what the king says and it will all be okay and multiple times along the way in their life's journey they said no way we will will obey the king to a certain place but you know what we can only go so far because we serve our God and you know I just think that's the way of the believer too we're gonna follow the the laws of the land as far as we can but when we're forced to actually stop actually serving God because of the laws of the land what else can we do where do we go what do we have you know there's many people that are actually through coved we got to see people rise up and try and cause conflict and declare it to be the word of God and they're making a stand for their rights and all this stuff what rights does a lamb being led to a Slaughter have what rights did Jesus have as he came and died for all of our sin he didn't he didn't claim to have rights as a lamb speechless he was led to the slaughter who are we to think that we have rights to jump up and down and scream and shout and try and make a scene in all in the name of Christianity the only thing that we need to do is just follow the word stay straight on that word just believe the word that the prophet messenger brought us and you know what that's the word that will see us through we'll still give on to Caesar with Caesar's but we'll give God what's God's and you know what it might actually not be in that order it might be the other way around but that's the way it's got to be and that's the age that we live in this age is is burned kindled seven times hotter brothers and sisters spiritually speaking than any other age and we've been thrown into that fire and you know what there is that fourth man he is in the fire he's with us every step of the way we have big challenges we have little challenges we have hot fires and we have cold fires but he's with us and we don't need to worry we just need to trust him we just need to follow his word his instruction and you know the instruction that was given to him these Hebrew kids where did the instruction come from they knew where the instruction came from it came from Ezekiel and it came from Jeremiah you know in the story of Jeremiah there's a point in the in the word I know we're almost out of time here maybe I'll call the musicians because I feel like I'm just getting started now one of these days I'm going to preach Jeremiah but you know there was a time where the king said to Jeremiah yeah I don't understand it why I I actually I I pray and I cry out and I pray but I just don't hear anything from God and hear you this this Mongrel of a person who claims to be a prophet of God that nobody respects you come in here and you say that you have the word of the Lord why don't I hear the word of the Lord he's got the prophet right in front of him telling him declaring the word of the Lord saying to him thus saith the Lord but he doesn't have ears to hear it brothers and sisters or eyes to see it and what did he do he led the whole city the whole country into destruction my goodness but these three Hebrew kids they were able they were able they had the ability to hear the thus saith the Lord in those prophets the teachings that those prophets brought and you know what some of those prophets might not even have been in the land it might have just been a recorded tape of a prophet it might have just been a printed book from a prophet it could have been a scroll that was rolled up from a prophet the words that were written by a prophet and there was one Hallmark term in those Scrolls and that was thus saith the Lord that actually was able to capture the attention of those Hebrew children and it's no different for us today we serve the same God some people would say oh the apostolic days are over there's no more prophets in the land and there are no more Major Prophets in the land the next major prophet that's going to be in the land is going to be in the Far East that's where that prophet's going to be but right now today the prophet that was here in flesh he said there is a prophet in the land and that Prophet is the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters he's our fourth man in the fire he will lead us and guide us maybe stand with me tonight take courage brothers and sisters don't worry if you're in a fire just look around and know that you're alive still because of that Fourth Man in the fire with us let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord that you change not we know that it's the teaching of Nebuchadnezzar to this world father that wants to put a change that wants to change the way you are and and our perception about who you are we know that you're not like Nebuchadnezzar we know that you don't have rage and fury for your children you have love and compassion and understanding for your children and Lord sometimes you correct your children but your children will always receive that correction and that is the true sign of a true child of yours father Lord help each one of us as we live our lives father to receive your correction when it comes father we don't want to live our lives unto ourselves but we want to live it unto you and we know that your your Prophet said that true eternal life is living for others Lord Jesus we don't have these lives here for ourselves father help us to just Lord put our shoulders to the wheel and Lord just give you all the glory of Our Lives father help us to look for that last predestinated seed as long as we're here father Lord we'll just be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory father we pray that you would just be with those who need a touch from you tonight father Lord and and wherever they are Lord we know brother Justice is traveling we pray that you would just keep your hand upon Him Father and bring him home safely at the appointed time Lord we thank you for your goodness to us we pray that you would be with sister vanderplast Lord in the hospital Lord Jesus father she needs a touch from you that you pray that you would comfort the family Lord in this hour of need Lord we just thank you for being with sister Helen and her family Lord in this trial father of losing a loved one lord it's never easy and

you would keep your hand upon us as we go our separate ways Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen can we sing that song In Christ Alone [Music] let's keep him first brothers and sisters sing this song
