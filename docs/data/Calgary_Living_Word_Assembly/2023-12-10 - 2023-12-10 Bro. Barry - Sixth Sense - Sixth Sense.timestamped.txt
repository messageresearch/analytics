[55:20] amen amen thank you musicians you have
[55:23] your Bibles this morning i' just like to
[55:25] read from Hebrews chap 11 certainly
[55:29] thankful to be back in service again
[55:32] it's been a while we've had quite a few
[55:35] ministers come through and certainly
[55:38] thankful for the five-fold ministry
[55:39] because that's where the perfecting of
[55:41] the Saints are it's not just in in in
[55:44] one of the
[55:46] five that's not where the Perfection
[55:48] lies even though there's lies that say
[55:51] there is we know the Perfections in the
[55:54] five full ministry and we're certainly
[55:55] thankful for each one amen Hebrews chap
[56:02] 11 maybe we'll just start reading with
[56:04] verse one I had one verse verse six that
[56:06] I wanted to get to but we'll just we'll
[56:08] just read one to
[56:10] six now Faith is the substance of things
[56:13] hoped for and the evidence of Things Not
[56:16] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[56:19] good
[56:20] report through faith we understand that
[56:23] the worlds were framed by the word of
[56:25] God so that the things which are seen
[56:29] were not made of things which do
[56:34] appear by faith Abel offered unto God a
[56:37] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[56:40] which he obtained
[56:41] witness that he was righteous God
[56:45] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[56:50] being dead yet speaketh isn't that rich
[56:54] God
[56:55] testified of his gifts
[56:58] yes verse five by faith Enoch was
[57:01] translated that he should not see death
[57:04] right and was not
[57:06] found because God had translated him or
[57:10] before his translation he had this
[57:14] testimony that he pleased
[57:17] God but without faith it is impossible
[57:21] to please him for he that cometh to God
[57:25] must believe that he is and that he is a
[57:29] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[57:33] him let's just bow one more time
[57:36] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[57:38] your word amen thank you for the so very
[57:41] many nuggets that are contained in this
[57:44] word Lord we're so thankful that you've
[57:46] given us the ability by your spirit Lord
[57:49] to read between the lines father we just
[57:52] ask that you would take this word that
[57:53] we've read this morning and that father
[57:55] it wouldn't just be print on a page it
[57:58] wouldn't just be words in our ears but
[58:00] Lord it would be a living word in our
[58:02] hearts Lord father that it would consume
[58:05] our very Souls Lord Jesus that this word
[58:08] would become so encompassing in our
[58:11] lives father that this is what we would
[58:12] live and breathe to this world around us
[58:15] Lord father we love you and we thank you
[58:18] we just commit every single word now as
[58:20] we go forwards into your hands Lord yes
[58:23] just ask all these things in Jesus
[58:25] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[58:27] this morning you may be
[58:31] seated just a couple of announcements
[58:34] before we get going here we have brother
[58:36] Cadre Diggs next weekend he will be here
[58:39] um Saturday night at 6:00 p.m. and 10:00
[58:43] a.m. Sunday morning with a youth event
[58:45] to follow on
[58:48] uh on Sunday after the
[58:51] service we have uh we have have the the
[58:55] month of December upon us and I've been
[58:57] thinking about it and and just praying
[59:00] about it and wondering what we should do
[59:02] and uh I just felt this year I don't
[59:05] ever want to get stuck in a tradition or
[59:07] a routine or a rut that's a religion and
[59:11] I don't want to do that and uh I don't
[59:14] know if I heard it said before but or or
[59:16] I mentioned it before but I heard a
[59:18] brother talking about it you know when
[59:19] you're training your body you don't want
[59:20] to do the same exercise every single
[59:22] time or your body will not
[59:25] strengthen to its full capacity but when
[59:28] you change things up the body actually
[59:31] gets the strongest that it's ever going
[59:32] to go so in light of that and and just
[59:36] the way I felt led to go this year we're
[59:38] not going to have a watch Night Service
[59:40] but what I want to do is encourage
[59:42] everyone to
[59:43] Fellowship I know that so many people
[59:45] have the desire to fellowship and uh we
[59:49] just want to create the opportunity for
[59:50] that because the way Services fall we're
[59:52] going to have regular Services both
[59:53] Sundays so we'll just see what the Lord
[59:56] will do and uh we'll resume the
[59:58] communion service the watch Night
[1:00:00] Service in January I trust that's okay
[1:00:03] with everyone um if not by all means
[1:00:06] just come and talk to me and uh you know
[1:00:09] we can talk about it today I want to
[1:00:11] talk about our
[1:00:13] senses I want to talk about our senses
[1:00:15] and I've got uh I feel a tremendous
[1:00:18] inspiration from the message a super
[1:00:21] sense from
[1:00:23] 1959 and we could just jump right to the
[1:00:25] punch line and I probably will um just
[1:00:28] so you know where I'm going with it and
[1:00:30] and that super sense is is not just the
[1:00:33] ability to believe and it's not just the
[1:00:35] ability to have faith and it's not just
[1:00:37] the ability to come to church and and to
[1:00:40] see that God sent a prophet it is all of
[1:00:43] that but it's none of that what what it
[1:00:45] is is the Holy Ghost that's the super
[1:00:48] sense that we're going to get to today
[1:00:49] that we're going to point to all service
[1:00:51] long and and every service is the Holy
[1:00:54] Ghost because just like Noah preached
[1:00:56] for how many years did he preach uh 125
[1:00:59] years get in the boat he had nothing
[1:01:02] else to say just get in the boat it's
[1:01:04] going to rain but everyone wanted to
[1:01:06] depend on their natural senses and their
[1:01:09] scientific reasoning and and their brain
[1:01:12] power and the ability that they had to
[1:01:14] study and and understand things
[1:01:17] naturally and they said it wasn't going
[1:01:19] to rain there's no rain we can prove
[1:01:22] there's no rain scientifically you're a
[1:01:24] quack remember brother bradam said he
[1:01:26] must have been must have the old bald
[1:01:28] head up on the hill must have got
[1:01:29] sunstroke beaten on the wood saying it's
[1:01:31] going to
[1:01:32] rain but what happened one day God said
[1:01:36] now it's time for you to get in the ark
[1:01:39] and you would think that these people
[1:01:40] I've marveled at this at times and I'm
[1:01:42] sure you have as well but you would
[1:01:43] think the people in that day would have
[1:01:45] said you know Noah said that it's going
[1:01:48] to rain and somehow this guy has the
[1:01:51] ability to capture the attention of two
[1:01:54] of every single living creature with
[1:01:56] breath in their lungs to get in that
[1:01:59] boat how does that
[1:02:01] work nobody seemed to question
[1:02:04] it or maybe they did but still they
[1:02:07] didn't have the ability to believe isn't
[1:02:09] that weird but yet once all the animals
[1:02:12] were in we know God told Noah it's time
[1:02:17] now it's time all things are
[1:02:20] ready get in the boat Noah right and
[1:02:23] when he got in the boat what happened
[1:02:24] happened God closed the door it wasn't
[1:02:27] Noah amen and you know we we've probably
[1:02:30] all heard of it before but the the the
[1:02:32] dramatization of of what it must have
[1:02:35] sounded like they were mocking him on
[1:02:37] the outside of the boat look at the
[1:02:39] crankies in there with all those animals
[1:02:41] the sun is baking hot and must smell
[1:02:43] real good in there now doesn't it Noah
[1:02:46] if anybody's been around animals you
[1:02:48] know what I mean stuck inside a boat in
[1:02:50] the sun it would be it would be really
[1:02:53] difficult 7 days they sat there so he's
[1:02:55] getting mocked from without and even
[1:02:57] from within the children must have been
[1:02:59] saying Daddy what's happening where's
[1:03:01] the rain we're listening we even put a
[1:03:04] tin roof up there so we could hear that
[1:03:06] rain but there's no rain coming Daddy
[1:03:09] and even his wife saying to him honey
[1:03:10] are you sure are you sure this is right
[1:03:13] are we going the right way we've given
[1:03:16] up everything we've spent our our whole
[1:03:18] Fortune building this boat and here
[1:03:21] we're sitting for six days and nothing's
[1:03:23] happened
[1:03:24] oh my thank the Lord for the seventh
[1:03:28] day yes and a prophet of God that would
[1:03:32] listen you know sometimes in our lives
[1:03:36] we don't even understand why the prophet
[1:03:39] said things the way he
[1:03:41] said but we
[1:03:43] follow because we know it'll turn out
[1:03:47] right I was doing a little reading this
[1:03:49] week and I I just thought you know it's
[1:03:52] amazing that we have the ability to talk
[1:03:54] about about a prophet and and to speak
[1:03:56] about prophetic insight and and and to
[1:03:59] say that we believe that God raised up a
[1:04:03] prophet to lead his
[1:04:05] church because how many prophets have
[1:04:08] there been raised up and how many of
[1:04:11] those prophets have been real
[1:04:14] quacks how many of them have done their
[1:04:16] own agendas some sort of demonic
[1:04:19] Behavior that's landed them in prison or
[1:04:23] worse
[1:04:25] how many prophets have there been but
[1:04:27] how many of them have just simply
[1:04:29] pointed to the word have just simply
[1:04:31] pointed to the word of God and said if
[1:04:33] you can't take my word for it take God's
[1:04:35] word for
[1:04:37] it not
[1:04:38] many if any except for one and it's just
[1:04:43] so beautiful to think you know what in
[1:04:45] Noah's day they were dealing on their
[1:04:47] senses they were totally relying upon
[1:04:50] their natural five senses and and and
[1:04:53] today we have people doing the very same
[1:04:56] thing but we know that we've been given
[1:04:58] a a six
[1:05:00] sense it's going to sound really simple
[1:05:03] after all that we've heard recently such
[1:05:06] great ministry every one of the brothers
[1:05:09] just bringing the truth as high as you
[1:05:12] want to go as a message believer and as
[1:05:14] low down deep below the surface as deep
[1:05:18] as you can possibly get in into the
[1:05:20] message of the hour we've heard it all
[1:05:22] recently it's been so good so rich today
[1:05:26] I just want to I just want to skip
[1:05:27] across the surface and hopefully just
[1:05:30] encourage us because we know the
[1:05:32] Mysteries and if we don't know the
[1:05:33] Mysteries there's only one way we're
[1:05:35] going to know them and that is to get
[1:05:37] the Holy
[1:05:38] Ghost because he the Holy Ghost Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ God himself when he the spirit of
[1:05:44] truth comes to you he will lead you and
[1:05:46] guide you into all truth he won't let
[1:05:49] you be led astray by a false prophet he
[1:05:51] won't let you be led astray by some
[1:05:54] black minister or Ministry he won't let
[1:05:57] you be led astray by family
[1:05:59] traditions for yourself you'll say I
[1:06:02] can't I can't follow that there's
[1:06:05] something that's just not right about
[1:06:06] that
[1:06:08] yes but there's no way we're going to be
[1:06:10] able to do that spiritually spinking
[1:06:12] with our senses our natural
[1:06:14] senses and and what I'm talking about
[1:06:16] specifically is the the five natural
[1:06:18] senses that we've been given and and
[1:06:20] we've been given them by God for a
[1:06:22] purpose but it's not to contact the
[1:06:24] spirit world and many times we try to
[1:06:27] deal with a spiritual situation with our
[1:06:30] natural
[1:06:31] senses and it's not going to
[1:06:35] work we know that the the the Deep
[1:06:37] caller to the deep and when there's a
[1:06:39] deep calling there's always a deep to
[1:06:42] respond if we have the ability to hear
[1:06:45] what the spirit saith unto the
[1:06:47] church but I want to talk about faith
[1:06:49] today and and our senses and you know
[1:06:52] I'm just going to start with a quote
[1:06:53] from a super sense in
[1:06:56] 1959 1227
[1:06:58] e brother bam he says I I would like to
[1:07:02] speak just for a short time on the
[1:07:05] subject of
[1:07:06] Senses we are taught that the natural
[1:07:09] man has five senses and those five
[1:07:11] senses control his or or give God gave
[1:07:14] him those five senses to contact his
[1:07:17] Earthly
[1:07:18] home and those senses are known as see
[1:07:21] taste feel smell hear those five senses
[1:07:25] which are known to the Natural man and
[1:07:27] they are good we cannot operate or live
[1:07:31] a normal life when one of these senses
[1:07:34] fail to
[1:07:35] act your sight hearing feeling smelling
[1:07:39] or tasting we cannot be normal without
[1:07:42] them there's something missing some
[1:07:45] portion of life that we cannot contact
[1:07:48] without that sense acting and they're
[1:07:51] good and they're useful and they were
[1:07:54] given to us by God yes but they're for a
[1:07:58] purpose brothers and
[1:08:00] sisters God gave those senses but
[1:08:04] they're given to you as a gift and it
[1:08:05] depends on how you what you yield these
[1:08:09] senses to will be the way that your life
[1:08:12] is
[1:08:14] controlled the way that you yield those
[1:08:18] five
[1:08:21] senses I'm just going to let that sink
[1:08:23] for a minute
[1:08:24] because we can live our lives in such a
[1:08:27] way that we have a a a real holy
[1:08:32] consecrated walk with the
[1:08:34] Lord but if we still go and yield our
[1:08:38] senses to the wrong things what's going
[1:08:40] to happen is we're going to ground out
[1:08:42] all of that power that we
[1:08:44] had the Holy Ghost is just going to take
[1:08:47] a step backwards and say well I'll just
[1:08:49] wait until you know what you're done
[1:08:50] doing whatever you're doing you know you
[1:08:52] shouldn't be doing what you're doing
[1:08:54] you know it because when he the spirit
[1:08:56] of truth comes he will lead you and
[1:08:58] guide you into all truth we're not going
[1:09:00] to go and do something and be like you
[1:09:02] know uh I don't know whether God thinks
[1:09:05] this is good or not if we're Believers
[1:09:08] we're going to know full
[1:09:09] well I remember hearing a minister say
[1:09:12] that you know what happens is there's a
[1:09:13] red flag there and you can choose to
[1:09:16] step over that red flag or not but if
[1:09:19] you choose to step over that red flag
[1:09:21] then you're actually going into a place
[1:09:23] where
[1:09:24] you know you shouldn't be and we know
[1:09:27] that once you're saved you're you're
[1:09:29] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:09:31] you're not going to lose your salvation
[1:09:32] our Salvation isn't going to be
[1:09:34] lost but as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:09:37] he'll allow us to harvest Harvest a
[1:09:41] harvest from the seeds that we've sown
[1:09:44] because whatever we we seow that that's
[1:09:47] what we're also going to reap that's the
[1:09:51] scripture God gave those senses but
[1:09:54] they're given to you as a gift and it
[1:09:56] depends on how you what you yield these
[1:09:59] senses to when have we ever had a time
[1:10:02] where we have so much to yield our
[1:10:04] senses
[1:10:05] to I just can't help but think back in
[1:10:07] the days of Noah I bet you they had a
[1:10:09] lot of stuff that they could yield their
[1:10:10] senses to brother brandom says that back
[1:10:13] then they were more technologically
[1:10:15] advanced than we are
[1:10:16] today I I think that's pretty amazing
[1:10:19] because there's some pretty tremendous
[1:10:21] uh technology in the world today
[1:10:25] but whatever we yield our senses to
[1:10:28] that's the way our life is
[1:10:31] controlled the way you yield those five
[1:10:34] senses your what you see what you hear
[1:10:39] what you taste smell or feel whatever
[1:10:43] those senses are yield to they will
[1:10:45] dominate
[1:10:47] you this just really spoke to me
[1:10:49] brothers and sisters wow if we're in a
[1:10:52] position in our lives where we just just
[1:10:53] seem to not be able to get the victory
[1:10:56] over a certain thing in our lives I want
[1:10:59] to ask the question today what do we
[1:11:01] yield these five natural senses to
[1:11:05] because they're the gateway to our soul
[1:11:07] that's the only way the devil can get to
[1:11:11] us sometimes he'll use people and people
[1:11:14] will say things people will do things
[1:11:17] but sometimes we'll see things sometimes
[1:11:19] we'll hear things what do we yield our
[1:11:22] senses to because that what's going to
[1:11:24] dominate us and you know what's
[1:11:25] interesting is when that happens in our
[1:11:27] lives it doesn't show up when we come to
[1:11:30] church we don't bring that to church we
[1:11:32] bring our best we bring our egame to
[1:11:34] church right we put on our Sunday Best
[1:11:36] and we come to church it's when we're at
[1:11:39] home it's when we're with our families
[1:11:41] it's when we're at school it's when
[1:11:42] we're on our job it's when we're alone
[1:11:45] that's when this problem can actually
[1:11:48] come to the surface but whatever we're
[1:11:51] yielding our senses to that's what will
[1:11:52] dominate us
[1:11:54] that's why I know it just about
[1:11:56] everybody here I'm sure you do and if
[1:11:57] you don't I strongly recommend it just
[1:11:59] play a message in your
[1:12:01] house play a message in your house even
[1:12:04] just super quiet doesn't even have to be
[1:12:05] loud just play it in the background just
[1:12:07] just let the message play now I know
[1:12:08] some people would say brother Barry you
[1:12:10] can never play a message and just let it
[1:12:11] play as background noise but I want to
[1:12:13] say this even if you're not listening
[1:12:15] the devil is and he don't like it none
[1:12:18] because it's a prophet of God but
[1:12:20] brothers and sisters every once in a
[1:12:22] while we're going to tune in and say oh
[1:12:24] that sounds familiar and as we do that
[1:12:26] something's going to happen
[1:12:27] supernaturally in our lives we're going
[1:12:29] to be yielding our senses to the word of
[1:12:34] God but if we just put on a gentle
[1:12:36] background music maybe Calgary soft
[1:12:40] rock oh oh maybe not that because that's
[1:12:43] Rock right maybe shine FM what's the
[1:12:48] difference can someone tell me the
[1:12:52] difference I I I don't think there's a
[1:12:54] difference in fact I think they're owned
[1:12:55] by the same
[1:12:57] company exactly maybe they just play
[1:12:59] Christmas carols on shine that's
[1:13:02] all but what are we yielding our senses
[1:13:04] to brothers and
[1:13:06] sisters and and my my heart's desire
[1:13:09] today is just to give us a a bump
[1:13:11] forwards just a a little bit of a boost
[1:13:13] in our Our Lives to think that you know
[1:13:15] what maybe there's something small that
[1:13:17] we can change that will give us a
[1:13:19] drastic impact in our lives that maybe
[1:13:21] we'll have a supernatural strength we
[1:13:23] didn't even realize we had but I want to
[1:13:26] say it today if you're a son and
[1:13:27] daughter of God you've already got it I
[1:13:29] just hope we can realize it
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:32] amen we know that we're talking about
[1:13:35] the the age the Christmas age the the
[1:13:37] Christmas story and I was so blessed
[1:13:40] this week I just had such a wonderful
[1:13:42] time I've been invited to come and
[1:13:44] minister at a at a chapel in uh uh
[1:13:46] Trinity Lodge it's just off of Glenmore
[1:13:49] Trail and and I've gone three times now
[1:13:51] and and this time I I just went in and I
[1:13:54] I I just told him about the Christmas
[1:13:55] story I thought it was so good but I I
[1:13:57] actually brought it from from Hebrews
[1:13:59] chap 11 you know without faith it's
[1:14:02] impossible to please him for he that
[1:14:04] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:14:06] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:14:08] diligently seek Him and every time I go
[1:14:10] to that Chapel I see the same faces but
[1:14:13] you know these people what do you say to
[1:14:15] people who are in the position of
[1:14:17] wanting to just go home these are people
[1:14:19] in their 80s and their 90s The Pianist
[1:14:22] the second last time I was there she
[1:14:24] said to the the the one man that I met
[1:14:26] there he she she said to he said you
[1:14:29] know well so good to see you we'll see
[1:14:30] you next time and she said I hope not I
[1:14:32] hope I'm already gone by the time we
[1:14:33] have Chapel next
[1:14:37] week I'm thinking wow what do we say to
[1:14:41] these people it's so wonderful though to
[1:14:43] be able to go and understand that even
[1:14:45] though we're in the Christmas season
[1:14:47] it's not about a baby in a manger it's
[1:14:49] about the living breathing word of Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ today
[1:14:54] right and you know it's it's it's
[1:14:56] interesting because they tell you you
[1:14:57] know it's a morning Chapel you get 10
[1:14:59] minutes to speak
[1:15:01] go and I always have to say I'm so sorry
[1:15:05] in advance because I don't know if I can
[1:15:07] just speak for 10 minutes but once upon
[1:15:09] a time I could but I I try to let them
[1:15:12] out on time I know I want to be
[1:15:13] respectful for them and just it's just a
[1:15:16] wonderful thing to think that you know
[1:15:18] there's people that really desire the
[1:15:20] sincere milk of the word they desire the
[1:15:23] the truth and and you see the same faces
[1:15:26] every single time you go and it's just
[1:15:28] wonderful but you know we've been given
[1:15:31] a super sign and and I believe most of
[1:15:34] the world would see it that that there
[1:15:36] is a super sign and that was God said
[1:15:39] I'll give you a sign to the prophet
[1:15:41] Isaiah and that will be that a virgin
[1:15:42] shall conceive and this is what I talk
[1:15:44] to these people about I don't think
[1:15:45] they've ever heard this before this one
[1:15:47] I think was a little bit much I said you
[1:15:49] know how many virgins were in the land
[1:15:51] that were taught this scripture that
[1:15:53] thought perhaps they could be the one
[1:15:56] perhaps I'm going to be that virgin how
[1:15:59] many of them were in the land but there
[1:16:00] was one there was one just like there's
[1:16:04] some today brothers and sisters who will
[1:16:06] not taste of death because they've got a
[1:16:09] testimony just like Enoch right that
[1:16:12] testimony is what that they please God
[1:16:16] because they're not bombarding their
[1:16:17] natural senses with all of the rubbish
[1:16:20] of this world they're taking and
[1:16:22] immersing thems elv in the word of God
[1:16:25] and there's so many different avenues
[1:16:26] that we can do it and one of the easiest
[1:16:28] ways is to just simply press play and
[1:16:31] obey obey the word of the Prophet which
[1:16:33] said obey the word of the
[1:16:36] Lord if we can do that brothers and
[1:16:38] sisters we'll have a testimony that
[1:16:39] we'll just please God and what will
[1:16:41] happen we'll just be like Enoch we'll
[1:16:44] have the same testimony that he pleased
[1:16:46] god without faith it's impossible to
[1:16:48] please
[1:16:49] him so how do we get this faith I think
[1:16:53] it's beautiful we're just going to dwell
[1:16:54] on this for a little bit you know we
[1:16:55] know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:16:57] of the word of
[1:16:59] God so just press play just let that
[1:17:02] message play brothers and sisters if you
[1:17:04] want to see a change listen to more of
[1:17:07] the message press play we we have the
[1:17:10] ability to have the audio Bible as well
[1:17:12] if you get tired of hearing the prophet
[1:17:14] talk you can press play on the on the on
[1:17:17] the audio Bible and listen to the pure
[1:17:18] word of God and I would say this don't
[1:17:21] go don't go and feed upon some different
[1:17:23] translation once in a while okay
[1:17:25] reference it but I would encourage every
[1:17:27] single one of us to follow what the
[1:17:29] prophet laid out as a pattern there's a
[1:17:31] reason why he used the King James
[1:17:33] version of the Bible and it's not
[1:17:35] something that we should just negate and
[1:17:37] maybe try and read a different different
[1:17:39] version of it because maybe that's what
[1:17:41] we've done in the past maybe what we
[1:17:43] need to do is push aside all of the
[1:17:44] things that we've done in the past and
[1:17:45] just press towards the mark for the
[1:17:47] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:17:49] Christ Jesus just follow the pattern
[1:17:51] that's been sent set for us but we know
[1:17:55] we live in the season where there was a
[1:17:56] super sign given and that's really what
[1:17:58] the birth of Jesus Christ was that was a
[1:18:01] super sign that a virgin shall conceive
[1:18:03] when did a virgin ever conceive before
[1:18:06] Mary and we've talked about it many
[1:18:09] times I think it's good there's a virgin
[1:18:11] today a virgin to his
[1:18:13] word and that virgin just says Amen to
[1:18:16] his word and every time she says Amen to
[1:18:18] his word something Supernatural happens
[1:18:20] that life inside of her just kicks it
[1:18:23] just bumps it just comes to life and
[1:18:25] something happens and eventually
[1:18:27] brothers and sisters it's no longer
[1:18:28] going to be just us plus whatever life
[1:18:31] is growing inside of us it's going to be
[1:18:33] the Lord Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ will be
[1:18:37] history right but we live in an age I
[1:18:40] believe today especially that we need to
[1:18:43] preach faith and not you know Faith
[1:18:47] healing okay we can do that we can
[1:18:50] totally do that because we need healing
[1:18:52] in our bodies we're not looking for
[1:18:54] healing on the in the Millennium we're
[1:18:56] not looking for healing in the New
[1:18:58] Jerusalem when when we look at the
[1:19:00] Timeline that brother mvin brought so
[1:19:02] beautifully we're not looking for
[1:19:04] healing once we actually are raptured in
[1:19:06] our bodies we're looking for healing
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] now but we know brothers and sisters the
[1:19:11] word of God says seek ye first the
[1:19:13] kingdom of God and then all these other
[1:19:17] things shall be added unto you we can't
[1:19:19] think that we're just going to come and
[1:19:21] and and bang on God's door and say I
[1:19:23] need healing I need healing I need
[1:19:25] healing without first repenting for our
[1:19:26] sins and saying I know that I'm a sinner
[1:19:29] and I know there's nothing good in me
[1:19:31] first we have to seek the kingdom of God
[1:19:33] if we're willing to come the way he
[1:19:35] wants us to we will please him and when
[1:19:38] we please him brothers and sisters
[1:19:40] something happens in our
[1:19:42] lives we know that Enoch was translated
[1:19:44] and he wasn't found isn't it interesting
[1:19:47] how the word says that by faith Enoch
[1:19:50] was translated that he should not see
[1:19:52] death
[1:19:54] it goes on to say and was not found
[1:19:58] because God had translated him it just
[1:20:01] totally took me to that to that that
[1:20:04] story of
[1:20:06] Elijah and remember the story of Elijah
[1:20:08] when he was taken up we know that the
[1:20:10] prophecy had gone forth that he was
[1:20:12] going to be taken up we know that the
[1:20:13] school of the prophets had heard they
[1:20:16] got the good word they were able to
[1:20:18] listen to The Prophet's message and they
[1:20:20] too knew they were enlightened that that
[1:20:22] there was actually going to be a Rapture
[1:20:24] that something was going to happen their
[1:20:25] master was going to be taken up and we
[1:20:27] know they came to Elisha think about the
[1:20:30] pressure on Elisha if you see me when I
[1:20:33] go you can have what you
[1:20:35] ask but then the prophet says to him you
[1:20:37] know why don't you just wait here I just
[1:20:39] got some business to tend to you know a
[1:20:40] little further down the road just just
[1:20:42] wait here and I'll be right back for you
[1:20:44] and he said not so Master you're not
[1:20:45] leaving my sight I'm not letting you go
[1:20:47] until I watch you go up because I
[1:20:49] believe the word for my day that's why
[1:20:54] but the school of the prophets we know
[1:20:56] that after he was raptured what happened
[1:20:58] they came to Elisha the follower and
[1:21:00] they said oh where's your master where'd
[1:21:01] he go he must be out in the mountains
[1:21:03] maybe he just went fishing he needed a
[1:21:05] break right he's out camping somewhere
[1:21:07] maybe we should send some people and we
[1:21:09] know that they came these were the
[1:21:11] prophets the school of the prophets the
[1:21:12] Believers they came and pressed him so
[1:21:14] much that he
[1:21:16] blushed he was embarrassed by it the way
[1:21:19] they asked him so he finally gave in and
[1:21:21] said go search
[1:21:23] and did they find him they couldn't find
[1:21:26] him I can only think that they must have
[1:21:28] done that for Enoch even though the word
[1:21:31] of God doesn't say it we know that he's
[1:21:33] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:21:35] and forever he doesn't change his
[1:21:37] program he's IM mutable as immutable in
[1:21:39] his nature as he is in his ways so I
[1:21:42] can't help but think that you know as
[1:21:44] Enoch was taken up and was not found
[1:21:47] someone looked for him someone searched
[1:21:51] yes they did but they couldn't find find
[1:21:53] Enoch where was he God translated
[1:21:57] him why because he pleased
[1:22:01] God he wasn't willing to be caught up in
[1:22:03] all the fanaticism in the day he wasn't
[1:22:06] willing to be caught up in all of the
[1:22:08] so-called religious behaviors of the day
[1:22:12] we know brother bradam said that in
[1:22:14] David's day they had all the religious
[1:22:16] motion they even had the Ark of the
[1:22:19] Covenant but they didn't do it the way
[1:22:20] that God said that that Ark should be
[1:22:22] carried over the heart of the Levites
[1:22:25] what did they do they put it on a new
[1:22:27] cart they did this new religion and what
[1:22:29] happened people died for it that's what
[1:22:31] will happen if we're willing to take a
[1:22:33] tradition or some sort of teaching or
[1:22:35] some sort of idea over top of the
[1:22:37] revelation of Jesus Christ in our
[1:22:44] day he had a a testimony that pleased
[1:22:47] God I just think that's
[1:22:49] beautiful it wasn't a quote it wasn't a
[1:22:53] song it was it wasn't something he
[1:22:55] preached it was that he believed he just
[1:22:58] believed the word of God and because of
[1:23:01] that he was translated I think it's so
[1:23:04] beautiful you know out of the Amplified
[1:23:06] I I said earlier I just want to be clear
[1:23:08] I'm I'm bringing it out of the Amplified
[1:23:10] just to try and enhance it a little bit
[1:23:12] but I don't sit at home and study the
[1:23:13] Amplified Bible I I get a an inspiration
[1:23:16] for a scripture and then I'll just look
[1:23:18] at it in the Amplified Bible I'll look
[1:23:19] at in the Strong's Concordance and
[1:23:21] that's as far as I go with it I don't
[1:23:23] even own an amplified Bible but just the
[1:23:27] Amplified Bible Hebrews 11:6 says but
[1:23:29] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:23:32] and be satisfactory to him who wouldn't
[1:23:36] want to please and be satisfactory to
[1:23:38] him for whoever would come near to God
[1:23:41] must necessarily believe that God exists
[1:23:45] and that he is the rewarder of those who
[1:23:49] earnestly and diligently seek him out
[1:23:54] I just can't help but think that it's
[1:23:57] it's it's it's imperative for us yes it
[1:24:01] is to diligently seek him out amen and
[1:24:05] and to me I I looked up the word but I
[1:24:08] didn't I didn't quote it I didn't bring
[1:24:09] it but to me to be diligent about it
[1:24:12] means to be very
[1:24:14] careful a and very very very deliberate
[1:24:18] about what we do and and how we do it
[1:24:20] for the word of God for
[1:24:22] seeking the Lord Jesus Christ in our day
[1:24:26] I believe it's what we do don't get me
[1:24:29] wrong but I just want to encourage us to
[1:24:31] watch watch what's affecting our senses
[1:24:34] because if we're relying on these senses
[1:24:36] in any way to help us down the spiritual
[1:24:39] Road there's potential that the devil
[1:24:42] will come and and and and mess with us
[1:24:45] and and get in our lives and mix us up
[1:24:48] out of a super sense brother Bram he
[1:24:51] says people who talk
[1:24:53] that there was no such thing as the Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit don't know what they're talking
[1:24:59] about now I believe that everyone here
[1:25:01] today believes there is such a thing as
[1:25:04] the holy spirit amen and I believe that
[1:25:07] everyone here today either has the holy
[1:25:10] spirit in their lives right now or will
[1:25:14] have old and young I'm not going to put
[1:25:17] anybody in a category that's up to God
[1:25:19] to do
[1:25:21] that but I just want to say what brother
[1:25:23] bradam said here I I I've never heard
[1:25:25] this story before it's just a little one
[1:25:26] and I thought it was so good he says
[1:25:28] like a boy once peeling an
[1:25:30] apple I was asked by an Infidel debating
[1:25:33] a meeting he said what do you want what
[1:25:37] do you want up here he said I want to
[1:25:39] ask you a question while he was eating
[1:25:41] the apple and enjoying it a very simple
[1:25:43] sort of a a looked like delinquent
[1:25:47] person with hair hanging in his face and
[1:25:49] one tooth out in the front a dirty
[1:25:51] overall all Jack it on he said just one
[1:25:54] question I want to ask you the Infidel
[1:25:57] had just said there's no such thing as
[1:25:59] God it's all emotion there's nonsense to
[1:26:03] it it's all all it is and the boy said I
[1:26:06] want to ask you a question Mister is
[1:26:08] this apple sweet or
[1:26:10] sour he said how do I know I'm not
[1:26:13] eating it it's a pretty fair answer and
[1:26:16] question isn't it right he said that's
[1:26:18] what I thought walked right back brother
[1:26:21] Bram says how do you know
[1:26:22] when you haven't tasted the
[1:26:24] Lord how do we know brothers and
[1:26:27] sisters unless you have tasted the
[1:26:30] Heavenly gift but I want to say this
[1:26:32] it's impossible for you to fall away
[1:26:34] once you have tasted that Heavenly gift
[1:26:37] once you have been sealed with the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost you're not going to fall
[1:26:40] away no we might just bombard our senses
[1:26:44] with the wrong things and cause a little
[1:26:46] bit of a bumpy road for us in our lives
[1:26:50] but once you're sealed you're sealed
[1:26:51] till your day of
[1:26:54] Redemption how do you know when you
[1:26:56] haven't tasted the Lord how do you know
[1:26:58] when you've never received the Holy
[1:27:00] Ghost whether he's real or whether he's
[1:27:03] not how do you know where there's faith
[1:27:06] and power how do you know there's not
[1:27:10] joy unspeakable and full of Glory when
[1:27:12] you've never tasted it to
[1:27:16] see hallu the six sense leads you to
[1:27:20] that the six sense declares that to
[1:27:24] you some might wonder why do you
[1:27:27] continually harp on the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:30] said it at the beginning I'll just
[1:27:31] reiterate it again brothers and sisters
[1:27:33] that's the only hope for our
[1:27:35] children I can teach them how to polish
[1:27:37] up put on the Sunday Best and go to
[1:27:39] church I can teach him all the message
[1:27:41] buzzwords I can teach him all the
[1:27:43] Mysteries but you know what if they
[1:27:45] don't have charity then all of that is
[1:27:48] like a sounding brass and a tinkling
[1:27:50] symbol isn't that what we've heard we we
[1:27:52] know that's the word of God we've got to
[1:27:54] get our children to Christ Jesus and the
[1:27:57] only way we're going to get them to
[1:27:58] Christ Jesus is by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:00] because you can't even call him Lord
[1:28:03] outside of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:28:06] amen how do you how do you know there's
[1:28:10] not joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:28:12] and you know what the beautiful thing is
[1:28:14] brothers and sisters if there's any but
[1:28:15] I don't even know but if there's anybody
[1:28:17] going oh I don't know I just I just
[1:28:18] can't make a decision I don't know I I
[1:28:20] kind of want to and I kind of don't want
[1:28:22] to I don't know can I do it you know
[1:28:24] what unless you've done it you'll never
[1:28:26] know it and you'll always
[1:28:30] wonder but why wouldn't you want joy
[1:28:32] unspeakable and full of Glory in your
[1:28:34] life right why wouldn't you want to go
[1:28:36] to bed at night Joy with joy unspeakable
[1:28:39] where you just can't even put words to
[1:28:40] what you're feeling and you just feel
[1:28:42] like it's full of Glory whe When when
[1:28:45] when you think about oh we're going to
[1:28:46] have church and something happens in
[1:28:48] your heart it just thumps in your chest
[1:28:50] oh my I'm going to church
[1:28:52] some people do things in life to
[1:28:54] actually get a thrill some people do
[1:28:56] things in life and it actually gets
[1:28:58] their heart to pump but you know I think
[1:29:00] the believer gets actually thinking
[1:29:03] about going to church we know that David
[1:29:04] said I was glad when they said let us go
[1:29:07] into the house of the Lord there's
[1:29:08] something that happens in our lives when
[1:29:10] we think about coming to meet at church
[1:29:12] because we're not coming to meet with
[1:29:14] our brothers and
[1:29:15] sisters if we are brothers and sisters
[1:29:17] we got it wrong we come to this building
[1:29:20] we're coming to meet with the Lord Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ amen how do you know there's not
[1:29:25] joy unspeakable and full of Glory when
[1:29:28] you've never tasted it to see it how do
[1:29:30] you know if the Apple's sweet or
[1:29:32] sour I've done that at home I'll just be
[1:29:37] honest I'm not really a big fan of mey
[1:29:40] apples I think they're probably better
[1:29:42] in a a crumble or a
[1:29:46] pie you know I like a really crisp sort
[1:29:50] of Sweet Apple something that's got a
[1:29:52] lot of juice it's juicy I like that kind
[1:29:55] of apple but how would I ever know until
[1:29:59] I taste it and I've seen them sitting on
[1:30:02] the counter in our house and I've
[1:30:03] thought you know that looks Meely to me
[1:30:05] I don't think so ah I'll pass by and you
[1:30:09] know I'll see one of my kids eating it
[1:30:12] and they'll be biting it and slurping
[1:30:14] the juice from it and it'll Crunch and
[1:30:16] crisp and I have to turn around and go
[1:30:18] back and grab one for myself because I'm
[1:30:19] like man that's a good apple I can tell
[1:30:21] just by the way they're eating it you
[1:30:23] know brothers and sisters if we're
[1:30:24] willing to take the time to take a look
[1:30:27] with our eyes you know brother bradam he
[1:30:29] says that we we we look with our eyes
[1:30:33] right but we see with our heart we don't
[1:30:37] see with our eyes as a man thinketh in
[1:30:42] what his heart so is he there's a whole
[1:30:46] thing here about senses that we'll
[1:30:48] probably talk about for a while but
[1:30:50] today we're just dwelling with the the
[1:30:52] natural external senses those five
[1:30:54] external senses but you know what I want
[1:30:56] to get to here and I just go off on a
[1:30:58] tangent and I apologize is that the
[1:30:59] devil wants us to think that it's not
[1:31:01] joy unspeakable that it's just misery
[1:31:03] you're just going to put on a ball and
[1:31:04] chain and now you're just going to drag
[1:31:06] that ball and chain around now you're
[1:31:07] going to be a message believer you're
[1:31:09] going to be a wife you're just going to
[1:31:10] have to be submissive slave for your
[1:31:12] husband every time he snaps his finger
[1:31:14] you're just going to drag that ball and
[1:31:15] chain around and around and around
[1:31:17] that's what the world Paints the picture
[1:31:18] of but you know what that's what the
[1:31:20] devil does because if you ever get to
[1:31:22] Christ you're only going to want to
[1:31:23] follow the word of
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:26] God it doesn't mean you're going to
[1:31:28] treat your wife like a slave you're not
[1:31:30] going to be a
[1:31:31] slave we know Paul said that he was a
[1:31:33] prisoner of
[1:31:35] Christ our wives aren't prisoners and
[1:31:38] you know what a man is going to treat
[1:31:40] his wife just like we want God to treat
[1:31:44] us as his
[1:31:45] bride he's going to esteem us as his
[1:31:49] bride he's going to treat us very well
[1:31:51] every one of us all the men especially
[1:31:53] here want to be treated good by God
[1:31:56] which means every one of us that want to
[1:31:58] be treated good by God is going to treat
[1:31:59] our wives just like we want God to treat
[1:32:01] us right amen if we're not there's
[1:32:04] something wrong
[1:32:07] amen but how do you know there's not joy
[1:32:09] unspeakable and full of Glory if you're
[1:32:12] afraid to taste it if you're afraid to
[1:32:13] see it it's the devil Satan has got in
[1:32:17] the way and and made it look like
[1:32:19] something that it's not because when we
[1:32:21] serve God with all of our hearts
[1:32:22] brothers and sisters it's joy
[1:32:24] unspeakable and it's full of Glory we
[1:32:27] see God come on the scene for us in our
[1:32:30] lives when we have problems in our lives
[1:32:32] and we come to the throne we bring a
[1:32:34] prayer request to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:37] he answers our prayers that's not to say
[1:32:40] he doesn't answer many other prayers in
[1:32:42] this world too right but as his bride
[1:32:46] she's the apple of his
[1:32:49] eye brother brandham goes on to say
[1:32:52] the six sense lends you to that the six
[1:32:56] sense declares that to
[1:32:59] you says there's no intellectual Powers
[1:33:02] at
[1:33:03] all I love this there's no intellectual
[1:33:06] Powers at all will ever bring that to
[1:33:10] you the intellectual Powers will
[1:33:14] reason and say why it's
[1:33:16] psychology it's something this way and
[1:33:20] it's emotion with the people
[1:33:23] remember sometimes people get upset when
[1:33:25] they see too much emotion but if your
[1:33:27] religion doesn't have
[1:33:29] emotion it's dead and you probably
[1:33:32] better bury it that's a direct quote
[1:33:35] from the
[1:33:36] prophet because when we truly find the
[1:33:39] Lord Jesus Christ when we truly find
[1:33:41] that pearl of great price we can't wait
[1:33:44] for those doors to be open to come and
[1:33:46] worship God to bring our praise offering
[1:33:49] unto him it's like someone getting the
[1:33:52] the revelation of tithing whoa that's
[1:33:55] what God wants me to do so that pleases
[1:33:57] him so if I bring my tithe to him that
[1:34:00] pleases him then there's a blessing in
[1:34:01] store for me and it's not about money
[1:34:03] it's about understanding that when my
[1:34:05] children get sick I can say you said you
[1:34:08] would rebuke the Devourer for my sakes
[1:34:11] when my Devil comes and tries to get in
[1:34:13] my marriage and mix it up I can say that
[1:34:15] you said that you would rebuke the
[1:34:17] devour for my sake when the devil tries
[1:34:19] to get into the church brothers and
[1:34:21] sisters if we take God at his
[1:34:24] word we can have a testimony that
[1:34:26] pleases him you know brother randam said
[1:34:29] it we know that God said it through
[1:34:30] brother Bram that God wants to bless us
[1:34:32] what a thousand times more did he say it
[1:34:34] that way than we're we're willing to
[1:34:36] actually accept it from
[1:34:42] him it's not just emotion emotion comes
[1:34:45] with it the Holy Ghost is without
[1:34:48] sensation you don't get a feeling in
[1:34:50] your senses that you got the holy ghost
[1:34:52] in your life you got the ability to say
[1:34:53] Amen to the word and every time you do
[1:34:56] something reacts there's a an emotion
[1:34:58] that comes with it you just can't help
[1:35:00] but say it and when you catch the
[1:35:01] Revelation about what saying Amen to the
[1:35:03] word does because you believe it
[1:35:07] something Supernatural takes place in
[1:35:08] your
[1:35:10] life and you get
[1:35:12] emotional anybody here ever got in the
[1:35:14] presence of God really in the presence
[1:35:16] of God where you know that you've been
[1:35:18] in the presence of God and not actually
[1:35:19] shed a tear
[1:35:25] can you go before the Throne of God and
[1:35:26] not actually get
[1:35:29] emotional I I don't know I'm not saying
[1:35:31] you should or you shouldn't but I know
[1:35:32] that I can't when you really break
[1:35:35] through and you get into that place the
[1:35:37] the presence of God comes in the room so
[1:35:39] strong oh my it does something to us
[1:35:42] brothers and sisters that's why you
[1:35:43] can't say that oh there's no emotion
[1:35:45] with it goodness sakes how can you have
[1:35:48] the pearl of great price and not get
[1:35:50] emotional
[1:35:52] but the bradam says it that the world
[1:35:54] they just love their baseball games and
[1:35:56] basketball games and football games and
[1:35:58] hockey games all the sports games in the
[1:36:00] world and they're not afraid to enter
[1:36:02] right in what about the Sons and
[1:36:05] Daughters of God that know that they've
[1:36:06] been just been freely given eternal life
[1:36:08] you just get to go to heaven you just
[1:36:10] get to go to the New Jerusalem you
[1:36:11] didn't do anything on your own you just
[1:36:13] get to go there because God knew before
[1:36:16] the foundation of the world that you
[1:36:17] were going to be an expression of him to
[1:36:19] this age you just get a pass doesn't
[1:36:21] matter about all your shortcomings or
[1:36:23] your failures you just get a pass my how
[1:36:27] could we not get excited brothers and
[1:36:29] sisters I'm not trying to pump us up but
[1:36:31] I just can't help but think how exciting
[1:36:33] it really is hallelujah boy if I won the
[1:36:35] 649 I'd probably be jumping around if I
[1:36:38] was Cadre Diggs I'd be doing it but I'm
[1:36:40] not so but if I W the Powerball lottery
[1:36:43] I'd be doing it I could buy a helicopter
[1:36:45] I could buy a Pilot I could do all these
[1:36:47] different things I'd be excited amen but
[1:36:51] but to think that all of that's going to
[1:36:53] burn oh my and there's going to be a
[1:36:55] city that comes down from heaven oh and
[1:36:58] it's going to have our name on it he's
[1:37:00] busy preparing that place for you right
[1:37:02] now brothers and sisters it's got your
[1:37:04] name on it it's an inheritance that's in
[1:37:07] heaven it's undefiled it's Incorruptible
[1:37:10] and it's reserved for
[1:37:16] you ram says but when the six sense
[1:37:18] comes in it denies all of those
[1:37:21] things and moves a person straight into
[1:37:24] the bosoms of God oh my he that cometh
[1:37:28] to God must believe that he is and a
[1:37:31] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:37:35] him so I want to say with our senses
[1:37:38] just on the basest level even if that's
[1:37:41] a word forgive me if it's
[1:37:46] not Tom Ernest reminded me that I'm not
[1:37:50] uh gramar correct
[1:37:55] individual God bless
[1:37:59] him what it is brothers and sisters is
[1:38:02] just such a tremendous thing if we're
[1:38:05] diligent when we're diligent when we
[1:38:08] seek Him by faith brother Bram says by
[1:38:11] Faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by
[1:38:14] faith Jacob all by faith it's the sixth
[1:38:18] sense that does it
[1:38:21] six sense denies all
[1:38:25] symptoms all symptoms anything that's
[1:38:29] contrary to God's word any
[1:38:32] feeling emotion somebody say oh well I
[1:38:36] was prayed for but I just don't feel any
[1:38:41] better that's not where the healing
[1:38:43] comes from brothers and sisters we're
[1:38:45] not trying to activate God's hand we're
[1:38:48] not trying to say that just if you do
[1:38:50] this that God will do do that what we
[1:38:52] are doing is saying that God gave us
[1:38:54] these instructions for a reason and the
[1:38:57] reason is that if we're willing to
[1:39:00] believe
[1:39:02] unequivocally not the words of brother
[1:39:04] Barry believe the words of God through
[1:39:06] the prophet believe those words and you
[1:39:10] will see the results that you're looking
[1:39:12] for right let that Sixth Sense take over
[1:39:16] don't worry about your
[1:39:20] feelings somebody say oh well I was
[1:39:22] prayed for but I just don't feel any
[1:39:23] better six cense would never stand still
[1:39:25] for that six cense would say it's a
[1:39:29] lie I feel
[1:39:31] better I'm getting well God said so that
[1:39:35] settles it amen God said so six cents
[1:39:38] only feeds on the word of God how many
[1:39:41] people have ever done that exercised
[1:39:43] that because I know that we all know
[1:39:44] this how many of us have ever done that
[1:39:47] and then started to feel
[1:39:49] worse that's the time to believe
[1:39:51] brothers and sisters because that's
[1:39:53] something's happening in your life you
[1:39:55] can see that the promise is on the
[1:39:58] way sometimes it's not in our time frame
[1:40:01] that's right just about every time it's
[1:40:03] not in our time frame amen it's always
[1:40:06] in his time frame but if we're willing
[1:40:08] to just trust him and take him at his
[1:40:10] word and just allow that time frame to
[1:40:13] manifest it will turn out right amen you
[1:40:17] know we say six sense here I don't know
[1:40:18] how many times he said in this message
[1:40:19] I'd like to look it up but he's talk
[1:40:21] about the Holy Ghost and I think I'll
[1:40:22] bring the quote here I don't know if
[1:40:23] I'll have it in here or not but he's
[1:40:25] speaking about the Holy Ghost Christ
[1:40:27] himself living out through the
[1:40:28] individual that's the six sense that
[1:40:30] he's talking about that super sense it's
[1:40:32] super above the senses it's greater
[1:40:34] sense it's a faith it's a power that
[1:40:37] stirs and drives amen it's something
[1:40:41] that makes you do things that you never
[1:40:43] thought you would do it's the six sense
[1:40:46] the super
[1:40:49] sense I just had this on my heart I'm
[1:40:52] going to say this my words here this
[1:40:54] morning brothers and sisters we're here
[1:40:57] together we heard it on Sunday and I
[1:41:00] believe we heard it in the past many
[1:41:02] times we're not we're not preaching
[1:41:05] Faith healing this is not first and
[1:41:08] second pull stuff we're not looking for
[1:41:10] skim milk we're not looking to name it
[1:41:14] and claim it we're looking for the Lord
[1:41:17] Jesus Christ in our lives we want to see
[1:41:19] the baptism of the holy spirit in our
[1:41:21] lives because that's what's going to get
[1:41:22] us out of here we could find our way
[1:41:25] into the graveyard but there's only one
[1:41:26] thing that's going to get us out of
[1:41:28] there but there's going to be a people
[1:41:30] who will be changed in the moment in the
[1:41:33] twinkling of an
[1:41:35] eye that shall not taste of death just
[1:41:37] like Enoch that's right and you know
[1:41:40] what we're preaching brothers and
[1:41:41] sisters this is third pole preaching
[1:41:44] that's where we're going with this that
[1:41:46] that's what this is that's my heart's
[1:41:48] desire is to just remind us this is
[1:41:50] third Paul preaching understanding who
[1:41:52] we are and what we're raised up for
[1:41:53] we're not just church members we're not
[1:41:56] just message Believers we're the living
[1:41:59] manifestation living attributes of the
[1:42:02] word for our day amen it is a living
[1:42:05] breathing word brothers and sisters it's
[1:42:07] not just a print on a page it's not just
[1:42:09] a a a place in Jeffersonville it's not
[1:42:12] just an app on a phone it's the Lord
[1:42:14] Jesus Christ Living out through his
[1:42:16] bride amen making himself real to her
[1:42:19] over and over and over again wooing her
[1:42:21] telling her just follow my word you'll
[1:42:24] please me and when you do you'll go in
[1:42:26] the
[1:42:29] rapture we know the great revivals have
[1:42:31] already happened in this
[1:42:33] world and people might say well brother
[1:42:36] Barry there's great Revival happening
[1:42:37] over in this continent and over here in
[1:42:40] this portion we know we just saw one
[1:42:41] down is it was it
[1:42:44] Asbury or Ashbury I can't remember the
[1:42:46] name of it but the University of pouring
[1:42:48] out I you know what brother Bram said it
[1:42:49] no doubt it's the holy spirit it's the
[1:42:52] anointed ones at the end time and those
[1:42:55] people were diligently seeking the Lord
[1:42:56] weren't they and you know he's a
[1:42:58] gentleman he always comes where he's
[1:43:01] invited but we can live on the anointing
[1:43:04] or we can live as Jesus Christ because
[1:43:09] if you've got him in you who are you
[1:43:11] brothers and sisters if you've got the
[1:43:12] Holy Ghost living out through you who
[1:43:14] are you you can't be your own
[1:43:17] anymore but we know that where we're at
[1:43:20] brothers and sisters the great Revival
[1:43:22] is over this world being swept over and
[1:43:24] pulling people out and and and like I
[1:43:26] said it can be said there's a revival
[1:43:28] going on and sure enough there is
[1:43:29] there's people crying out saying that
[1:43:31] there's a great revival going on but we
[1:43:33] know we had a prophet in our day that
[1:43:35] was rejected when the Great Revival was
[1:43:37] actually
[1:43:39] happening what
[1:43:41] happened they rejected the word of God
[1:43:44] for their day which means judgment is
[1:43:46] the only thing that's left but when he
[1:43:49] was here preaching when he was here
[1:43:52] bringing the word as God's prophets do
[1:43:55] amen he said that the revivals are
[1:43:59] over there is going to be another one
[1:44:02] though and that's going to be the
[1:44:04] bride's
[1:44:05] Revival and so there is a Revival that's
[1:44:07] happening today and I want to say it
[1:44:09] this way that it is the bride's
[1:44:11] Revival but he also said this when you
[1:44:13] see the unwise Virgin go looking for oil
[1:44:17] get ready look up because your
[1:44:19] Redemption draws
[1:44:21] brothers and sisters I want to say it
[1:44:22] this morning get ready because there is
[1:44:24] a group of people that's out there
[1:44:26] searching diligently for oil but they're
[1:44:28] willing to reject the word of a
[1:44:31] Vindicated Prophet God help us right you
[1:44:34] can't reject God's word through a
[1:44:37] prophet and we know that Jesus said hey
[1:44:39] you know what they couldn't believe him
[1:44:40] we know Joseph we know who your dad is
[1:44:42] we know who your mother is we know
[1:44:44] you're an illegitimate child dealing
[1:44:47] with her senses right y going For The
[1:44:50] Senses oh we're looking at it naturally
[1:44:52] you can't take a a prophetic scripture
[1:44:55] and and and apply it and say that I'm
[1:44:57] going to interpret it naturally it
[1:44:58] doesn't work that way can you take it
[1:45:00] back to the word that's what we got to
[1:45:02] be able to do so long as we can connect
[1:45:04] the dots in the word then we can say hey
[1:45:05] you know what just like Jesus said if
[1:45:07] you can't believe me believe the works
[1:45:09] that I do because they are they that
[1:45:10] testify of who I
[1:45:13] am yes there is a Revival that's
[1:45:16] happening right now but it's a private
[1:45:18] event isn't it beautiful it's a private
[1:45:21] event and it's the bride's Revival
[1:45:23] Hallelujah she's she's having a real
[1:45:25] Fiesta she's really enjoying her time in
[1:45:28] the word with the word as the word
[1:45:32] amen and it's all about knowing who we
[1:45:35] are and and I just think it's so amazing
[1:45:38] because like I said I was looking at
[1:45:40] this stuff and seeing how these false
[1:45:42] prophets rise up and they try and exalt
[1:45:45] people and make people feel like there's
[1:45:46] something Elite and and there's
[1:45:48] something better better class of people
[1:45:50] people we heard about classes of people
[1:45:52] on Wednesday and sure enough there is a
[1:45:54] better class of people but you know
[1:45:55] those better people they're humble
[1:45:58] people they're not puffed up they don't
[1:46:01] walk down the street and think that oh
[1:46:03] Lord I'm so glad that I'm better than
[1:46:05] that person look at that person he's got
[1:46:07] all this this natural sign of the world
[1:46:10] in his life or the thumping music in his
[1:46:12] car or whatever it is all these problems
[1:46:15] we see in this world brothers and
[1:46:16] sisters but for the grace of God there
[1:46:18] go I amen we need to keep that in our
[1:46:21] minds and recognize that the truly elect
[1:46:25] bride of Jesus Christ is probably one of
[1:46:28] the most humble people that you'll ever
[1:46:29] meet because she knows that it's only
[1:46:31] because he called her before the
[1:46:33] foundation of the world he chose her to
[1:46:36] be his bride she didn't say oh I'm going
[1:46:39] to be the bride of Christ doesn't work
[1:46:41] that
[1:46:42] way there is a Revival happening it's a
[1:46:45] bride's
[1:46:46] Revival and it's happening it's in full
[1:46:48] swing it's beautiful
[1:46:51] brother Bram goes on to say in a super
[1:46:53] sense and we are a great we are grateful
[1:46:55] to God that we have the five senses but
[1:46:58] we by no by no means but by no means was
[1:47:02] these five senses given to you to guide
[1:47:05] you they were given to you for Earthly
[1:47:09] contact but there was given you a six
[1:47:11] sense and that six sense is belongs only
[1:47:15] to the
[1:47:18] Christian just letting that soak a
[1:47:20] little bit it and you cannot have this
[1:47:23] six sense until you become a
[1:47:26] Christian it's the only way you can ever
[1:47:29] have any more than the natural than the
[1:47:32] five natural senses for the natural
[1:47:34] person but the six sense is better known
[1:47:37] to the Christian as Faith it's the one
[1:47:40] that governs and guides you and it's
[1:47:43] Superior to all the other
[1:47:46] senses it's Superior to all the other
[1:47:49] senses the other five
[1:47:52] senses and I I want to say this I'll get
[1:47:55] into it maybe later we'll see how the
[1:47:57] the Lord just leads but many people
[1:48:00] might be asking well brother Barry isn't
[1:48:02] there five other senses and there are
[1:48:03] five inner senses and these are the more
[1:48:05] tricky ones because the devil can get
[1:48:07] into our emotions they can get into the
[1:48:10] the inner five senses Consciousness
[1:48:12] reasoning memory memory is a bad one the
[1:48:16] devil can get into memories and and
[1:48:18] cause us to remember things that we need
[1:48:20] to forget and many times it's things
[1:48:23] that we've actually said oh I've
[1:48:25] forgotten and I've forgiven I've
[1:48:27] forgiven and I've forgotten yeah it's
[1:48:29] all good but what happens is the Devil
[1:48:31] comes around when something new happens
[1:48:33] especially in marriages if anybody's
[1:48:35] married you probably encountered this
[1:48:36] and if you haven't God bless
[1:48:39] you but the Devil comes around and says
[1:48:42] remember that thing that she did
[1:48:44] remember that thing that he did and it
[1:48:46] becomes a little bit of Leverage and and
[1:48:48] you can take that and just add it to the
[1:48:50] moment of anger and you don't have to be
[1:48:51] married to encounter you can have a
[1:48:53] friend you can have a brother or a
[1:48:55] sister and say that you know I remember
[1:48:57] they did that to me and and now they did
[1:48:59] this to me and they're always the same
[1:49:01] they're never going to change it just we
[1:49:04] don't need to do that that's the devil
[1:49:06] getting into the inner senses I'm not
[1:49:07] getting into those today I don't want to
[1:49:08] do that but we got to be careful how we
[1:49:11] use our senses we cannot guide ourselves
[1:49:13] spiritually by our natural senses
[1:49:18] right I think it's just so
[1:49:22] important so important to get a super
[1:49:24] sense brother Ram he says going on here
[1:49:27] he says now I would not say that because
[1:49:31] we receive the six sense that the five
[1:49:34] senses are no good no more yes they are
[1:49:38] I love it the way he says stuff there's
[1:49:40] always a balance to it right it's always
[1:49:44] balanced if we're just willing to listen
[1:49:46] to what he says says yes they are those
[1:49:50] five senses were given to you by God and
[1:49:53] they are to be used but when the five
[1:49:56] senses act contrary to the word of God
[1:49:59] then they are
[1:50:01] lying I love how he said that they're
[1:50:04] not just wrong they're not just
[1:50:06] incorrect they're
[1:50:08] lying now the six sense cannot lie it's
[1:50:12] a super sense and that's what I want to
[1:50:14] speak about this morning I spoke on a
[1:50:16] super sign and tonight on a super sense
[1:50:21] and the super sense is the Holy
[1:50:24] Spirit the faith of God that dwells in
[1:50:29] you excuse me and if you let the five
[1:50:32] senses be yielded to the six sense it'll
[1:50:36] guide you and bring all the other five
[1:50:39] senses under control of that super
[1:50:43] sense I think that's that is so rich
[1:50:46] right there brothers and sisters but
[1:50:48] that is not an easy task
[1:50:50] because we got this old man that we deal
[1:50:52] with every single day but you know
[1:50:55] that's why Paul said I Die daily amen I
[1:50:58] I I go on my knees and I say let me
[1:51:01] crucify this flesh Lord let your spirit
[1:51:04] live out through me let don't don't let
[1:51:06] it be Barry living out through this
[1:51:08] world don't don't let it be Barry that
[1:51:10] the children see or that my wife sees
[1:51:12] let it be Jesus Christ amen let let my
[1:51:15] family around me see Jesus Christ Living
[1:51:18] out through me let the friends in this
[1:51:20] world let all the people in this world
[1:51:22] see a totally different individual let
[1:51:24] them see a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:51:27] if we're willing to do that that's
[1:51:29] yielding our bodies that's yielding our
[1:51:32] minds that's yielding all of our senses
[1:51:35] to that single sick sense and when we do
[1:51:38] that brothers and sisters something
[1:51:40] Supernatural takes place and you know
[1:51:41] what even if we're willing to take five
[1:51:42] minutes in the morning because we're
[1:51:44] busy we're rushed we slept in we had
[1:51:46] such a wonderful time of Fellowship on
[1:51:47] Sunday now Monday morning hits we got to
[1:51:49] get the kids to school school got to get
[1:51:50] their lunches got to get out the door
[1:51:52] got all this pressure pressure pressure
[1:51:54] got to get to
[1:51:55] work that's life that's the life we
[1:51:58] live but don't let it get in the way of
[1:52:01] that sick sense Satan wants to squeeze
[1:52:04] the pressure on us and tell us we're too
[1:52:06] busy but even five minutes even three
[1:52:08] minutes even a couple words breathed in
[1:52:10] prayer brothers and sisters can change
[1:52:12] the day Amen brother Bram says that
[1:52:16] super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith
[1:52:17] of God that dwells in you and if if
[1:52:19] you'll let the five senses be yielded to
[1:52:21] the six sense it'll guide you and bring
[1:52:24] all the other five senses under control
[1:52:26] of that super
[1:52:27] sense for it's so far above the natural
[1:52:30] sense that the spiritual man is above
[1:52:33] the natural it's as far as high as the
[1:52:37] heavens is above the natural man and has
[1:52:39] five senses it makes you believe things
[1:52:43] that you cannot
[1:52:45] see it makes you believe things that you
[1:52:48] cannot see amen
[1:52:50] it makes you act where you do not think
[1:52:53] the five senses would ever think about
[1:52:56] it remember this what he says here the
[1:52:59] devil can get into these five senses and
[1:53:01] lie to
[1:53:02] you but he can't touch that super
[1:53:05] sense he can't touch that super Faith he
[1:53:09] can't touch that Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:53:12] can't touch the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[1:53:15] and that's why he can impersonate
[1:53:17] anything but he cannot impersonate the
[1:53:20] word amen that's why we've got to be
[1:53:23] able to take it back to the word
[1:53:24] brothers and
[1:53:26] sisters sometimes we'll hear things in
[1:53:28] our lives and we'll say you know that
[1:53:29] just doesn't ring true but I can't put a
[1:53:31] scripture to it I can't understand it I
[1:53:33] just don't know just ask God just ask
[1:53:36] him and I guarantee you he'll give you
[1:53:38] an answer for it he'll bring a scripture
[1:53:40] or you'll hear a quote from the prophet
[1:53:42] one or the other or maybe a brother will
[1:53:43] say it to you or a sister will say it to
[1:53:45] you you'll hear an answer though God
[1:53:46] will give it the devil can get into the
[1:53:49] these five senses and lie to you but he
[1:53:52] cannot touch that super sense that's far
[1:53:55] beyond his reach that come from God it's
[1:53:58] called faith faith is that great thing
[1:54:02] isn't that wonderful brothers and
[1:54:03] sisters he can't touch that six sense
[1:54:06] don't you want to be where the devil
[1:54:07] can't
[1:54:08] touch want to be in a place where the
[1:54:11] devil can't touch our relationships with
[1:54:14] our husbands our relationships with our
[1:54:16] wives our relationships with our parents
[1:54:18] our relationships with our children
[1:54:19] children oh my all of these
[1:54:22] relationships in our lives if we can be
[1:54:24] in a position like that we know Satan
[1:54:27] won't be able to touch us that's
[1:54:29] incredible I want to live
[1:54:31] there brother Bram going on here he says
[1:54:34] and the five senses does not control the
[1:54:36] six sense but the six sense controls the
[1:54:40] five
[1:54:41] senses the super sense controls the
[1:54:44] natural senses and the five senses is
[1:54:47] see taste feel smell and hear and the
[1:54:50] super sense is something that'll make
[1:54:52] you believe God's word isn't that
[1:54:55] beautiful yes amen it's not going to
[1:54:58] make you be someone that you're not it's
[1:55:01] not going to give you riches it's not
[1:55:03] going to make you speak in tongues it's
[1:55:06] not going to make you have the gift of
[1:55:08] healing or the gift of discernment it's
[1:55:10] not going to be any of these gifts that
[1:55:12] the devil can impersonate he just says
[1:55:14] it right there it gives you the ability
[1:55:16] that'll make you believe God's word for
[1:55:19] that's the only thing it'll speak
[1:55:23] about what do we saturate our senses
[1:55:25] with brothers and
[1:55:26] sisters you know sometimes we don't even
[1:55:29] have to saturate our senses sometimes it
[1:55:31] can just be a little tiny bit I I got
[1:55:34] into uh I got into welding a little bit
[1:55:37] and uh sorry brother Jeff I'm going to
[1:55:39] talk about you a little bit I'm G to
[1:55:40] brag on you brother Jeff's a welder here
[1:55:43] and uh he's got a welding rig and he was
[1:55:45] teaching me a little bit about welding
[1:55:47] but you know while we were doing it I
[1:55:48] just kept thinking if anybody's familiar
[1:55:51] with it you can get a flash from the
[1:55:54] weld that's so bright it can burn your
[1:55:56] eye and and it doesn't take very much of
[1:55:58] it to actually hurt you to really hurt
[1:56:01] your eye but prolonged exposure without
[1:56:04] dealing with it correctly can really
[1:56:05] hurt you as well but you know what I
[1:56:07] just got thinking about sometimes our
[1:56:09] senses can be just like that we can have
[1:56:12] a very very small exposure of something
[1:56:16] just flash in front of our eyes and you
[1:56:18] know what it does it affects us us and
[1:56:20] and it might not be just one and it
[1:56:22] might not be just two but it can be over
[1:56:25] time just a little bit here and a little
[1:56:27] bit there and a little bit here and a
[1:56:28] little bit there and before long if
[1:56:30] we're not careful if we're not guarding
[1:56:32] ourselves putting on the whole armor of
[1:56:33] God brothers and sisters our natural
[1:56:35] senses can allow enough saturation of
[1:56:38] these little tiny things it's not the
[1:56:40] big problems that spoil the vine it's
[1:56:42] the little foxes that spoil the vine the
[1:56:45] little tiny things in our life that we
[1:56:47] might just say it's okay I can do that I
[1:56:50] can handle that it's not a big deal I
[1:56:52] know many brothers that are doing it I
[1:56:53] can do it with many other brothers and
[1:56:56] everybody's doing it it's just fine it
[1:56:58] might not be just fine brothers and
[1:57:00] sisters amen is it is it agreeing with
[1:57:03] the word I would say this whatever we're
[1:57:05] doing are we doing it under Christ
[1:57:08] because if we're not doing it under
[1:57:09] Christ then we shouldn't be doing it I
[1:57:12] say Lord help
[1:57:14] me says that super sense is something
[1:57:16] that'll make you believe God's word for
[1:57:18] it's the only thing it'll speak about
[1:57:20] it'll make you believe for things that
[1:57:22] you can't see taste feel smell or hear
[1:57:26] because it'll take God's word and it
[1:57:28] will deliver that word to you and make
[1:57:32] you walk contrary to any other thing
[1:57:35] there is but God's word by faith faith
[1:57:39] does
[1:57:43] it we live in a world where the devil
[1:57:46] can get into our lives and so many
[1:57:49] different Avenues so many different ways
[1:57:52] of affecting our
[1:57:53] senses but we have the ability to have
[1:57:55] that super sense we've got the ability
[1:57:57] to overcome All Things by the Lord
[1:58:00] living out through
[1:58:03] US brother Bram goes on to say I know I
[1:58:06] got lots of quotes but I'm not going to
[1:58:08] keep us long today he says now you
[1:58:11] cannot believe it until you are
[1:58:13] regenerated the Bible said that no man
[1:58:15] can call Jesus the Christ only by the
[1:58:18] Holy Ghost
[1:58:20] and Jesus means Jesus and the Christ is
[1:58:23] the anointed one the Messiah the sent
[1:58:26] one no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:58:29] only by the holy ghost that six sense
[1:58:32] that we're talking about we went through
[1:58:35] that this last week and it's been such a
[1:58:37] stumbling block especially to the
[1:58:39] Pentecostal believing people when they
[1:58:42] hear me say that Jesus said in St John
[1:58:44] 5:24 he that heareth my word and
[1:58:46] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:58:48] eternal etal life eternal life comes
[1:58:51] from God alone and no man can say Jesus
[1:58:55] is the Christ only by the Holy
[1:58:58] Ghost you're only taking what somebody
[1:59:02] else said what you learned by
[1:59:06] intellectual what you learned by the
[1:59:08] natural five senses but when the six
[1:59:12] sense comes in the Holy Spirit it takes
[1:59:15] away all the reasonings right of these
[1:59:18] six senses
[1:59:20] and five senses and lifts you up into
[1:59:24] that six sense to make you believe
[1:59:26] things that you can't see taste feel
[1:59:30] smell or hear Hallelujah does something
[1:59:33] to
[1:59:35] you then you can say Jesus is the Christ
[1:59:38] because you have witnessed
[1:59:40] it not what intellectual teaching has
[1:59:44] taught
[1:59:45] you but what you've
[1:59:48] experienced
[1:59:50] and that's why brothers and sisters
[1:59:51] today I I just want to emphasize it
[1:59:54] again that's why we preach the Holy
[1:59:56] Ghost here in this
[1:59:58] church and you know we don't we don't
[2:00:00] preach it in such a way that we we want
[2:00:02] to see gifts manifesting and that's
[2:00:04] going to be our true evidence of the
[2:00:06] Holy Ghost In Our Lives what we do is we
[2:00:08] preach Christ crucified and that he died
[2:00:12] and he rose again and it's not just
[2:00:14] 2,000 years ago that he truly lives out
[2:00:18] through his bride body
[2:00:20] today our ability to say that it's not
[2:00:23] an intellectual teaching that's taught
[2:00:25] us but it's what we've experienced it it
[2:00:28] is we know that Pentecost brother
[2:00:30] brandom says that Pentecost is not just
[2:00:32] a denomination in fact it's not a
[2:00:34] denomination even though the world and
[2:00:36] the devil has tried to make it that way
[2:00:37] it's an experience it's an upper room
[2:00:40] experience where we encounter the Holy
[2:00:43] Ghost for ourselves when we do that we
[2:00:45] do become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[2:00:47] but it gives us the ability to to
[2:00:49] overcome all of these five senses if we
[2:00:51] can subdue these five senses I think the
[2:00:53] world would be a better place maybe we
[2:00:55] should start campaigning that if we can
[2:00:57] just get the Holy Ghost in our lives and
[2:00:59] subdue these
[2:01:01] senses we know the world would never go
[2:01:03] for it oh they wouldn't
[2:01:05] never brother bam goes on to say the six
[2:01:08] Sense come for this reason now the six
[2:01:10] sense is the faith the super sense now
[2:01:14] the six Sense come for this reason only
[2:01:16] that was to make the five senses in you
[2:01:19] you deny anything that's contrary to
[2:01:21] God's
[2:01:24] word I find myself many times looking at
[2:01:27] situations naturally and I have a
[2:01:30] natural opinion and I've got a natural
[2:01:33] tendency and a natural thought pattern
[2:01:36] but there's got to be a time where we
[2:01:38] stop doing that and and where we say you
[2:01:40] know I want to see the good in people I
[2:01:43] want to see the Holy Ghost in people I
[2:01:45] don't want to see the natural
[2:01:47] circumstances I don't want to read a
[2:01:49] book just by looking at its cover I want
[2:01:52] to be able to take a look at this
[2:01:53] situation I want to be able to go on my
[2:01:55] knees and ask the Lord to show me what's
[2:01:58] going on to have discernment by the six
[2:02:01] sense and you know if we do that as
[2:02:03] Believers our world would be a different
[2:02:06] place brothers and
[2:02:08] sisters that's what the six sense is for
[2:02:12] the scripture speaks of casting down
[2:02:16] reasonings taking every thought
[2:02:19] into
[2:02:20] captivity right because the devil plants
[2:02:24] a thought in our head doesn't mean that
[2:02:25] we've gone ahead and done it doesn't
[2:02:27] mean that it's our thought it's the
[2:02:30] devil's thought but if we don't take the
[2:02:32] time that Split Second to take that
[2:02:34] thought into captivity and recognize is
[2:02:37] it a the word of God if it's not of the
[2:02:39] word of God brothers and sisters it's of
[2:02:41] the
[2:02:43] devil take it into captivity give it a
[2:02:45] split second and just see where it came
[2:02:48] from and if it's the devil's give it
[2:02:50] back to him that ain't my thought I
[2:02:53] never thought that that wasn't that
[2:02:55] wasn't mine that was from the devil amen
[2:02:59] I think it's so beautiful when we can
[2:03:00] start to look at it that way and
[2:03:01] recognize that it's actually the devil
[2:03:04] we can give it back to him and remind
[2:03:06] him of his future and say maybe once
[2:03:08] upon a time you affected me that way but
[2:03:10] buddy you've got it coming to
[2:03:12] you try and dig up my past let's go to
[2:03:15] your future and you know what there
[2:03:17] comes a time where he'll leave
[2:03:20] he'll split the devil will leave you
[2:03:22] alone he will stop bugging you he'll
[2:03:25] come around again but that's why we've
[2:03:27] got to put on the whole armor of God
[2:03:29] that's why we've got to fortify
[2:03:30] ourselves that's why we need to have the
[2:03:32] six
[2:03:33] sense without that we're going to be
[2:03:36] just beat
[2:03:38] up the five senses will you can
[2:03:42] reason well now why should this man he
[2:03:45] why should but the six sense doesn't see
[2:03:49] that at
[2:03:50] all they see it brother in
[2:03:53] Christ you know we uh I think we read a
[2:03:56] scripture recently or a quote a quote
[2:03:58] sorry um where brother bradam says that
[2:04:00] you know when we get that six sense when
[2:04:01] we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's
[2:04:03] going to give us the ability to
[2:04:06] actually endure with a brother to be
[2:04:09] able to intreat him even when we know
[2:04:11] he's
[2:04:12] wrong are we able to do
[2:04:15] that six sense doesn't see that at all
[2:04:18] it's so far beyond it it's so much
[2:04:21] higher than it is until it don't even
[2:04:24] have any reasonings at all with it we
[2:04:27] believe it it's far beyond anything that
[2:04:30] the five senses would have to say about
[2:04:32] it now get ready for a healing service
[2:04:35] see we believe it you walk by that six
[2:04:39] sense you talk by that six sense you
[2:04:43] live by that six sense you die by that
[2:04:46] six sense and you rise by that six sense
[2:04:50] that super sense something that's in you
[2:04:53] that's different from what the natural
[2:04:55] man is I love the way he says that
[2:04:59] because doesn't leave any room out for a
[2:05:01] Believer doesn't give us room to say
[2:05:04] well I can just go and do this I can
[2:05:05] take Liberty to do that uh you know we
[2:05:07] can do the other thing no we live by it
[2:05:11] we die by it we walk by it we talk by it
[2:05:15] we think by it everything that we do is
[2:05:17] by the six sense which is the Holy Ghost
[2:05:20] amen that's going to give us overcoming
[2:05:23] power brothers and sisters where we get
[2:05:25] to the place where Satan won't even want
[2:05:26] to deal with us we will be so far hid
[2:05:29] back in Christ the devil will say no no
[2:05:31] no no no no we'll go and deal with all
[2:05:33] the other people in this world but not
[2:05:35] them we don't want nothing to do with
[2:05:36] them because we can't get
[2:05:39] through that's where we find ourselves
[2:05:43] turn with me this morning over to First
[2:05:45] Peter just got a couple of scriptures I
[2:05:47] wanted to read
[2:05:52] hope it's okay we still
[2:05:53] got six minutes seven
[2:06:15] minutes I wanted to read a lot but I
[2:06:18] don't know
[2:06:19] maybe
[2:06:24] uh we'll just read verse
[2:06:27] 7 start at verse 7
[2:06:30] anyway but the trial of your faith being
[2:06:33] much more
[2:06:35] precious than of gold that
[2:06:37] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[2:06:40] might be found unto praise and honor and
[2:06:43] Glory at the appearing of Jesus
[2:06:46] Christ whom having not seen ye
[2:06:50] love in whom though now ye see him not
[2:06:55] yet believing ye Rejoice with joy
[2:06:58] unspeakable and full of
[2:07:02] Glory receiving the end of your faith
[2:07:06] even the salvation of your
[2:07:09] souls of which salvation the prophets
[2:07:12] have inquired and searched diligently
[2:07:15] who prophesied of the grace that should
[2:07:17] come unto you
[2:07:20] we know it very well but as we've read
[2:07:24] you know when we're going through the
[2:07:25] trial in our lives brothers and sisters
[2:07:28] it's not the trial for the natural
[2:07:30] senses it's not the trial for the things
[2:07:32] that we see naturally speaking it's for
[2:07:34] the trial of our
[2:07:36] faith the devil wants us to believe that
[2:07:39] we don't have faith and that's why we're
[2:07:41] in a trial but what's happening is it's
[2:07:44] the exact opposite we're in the trial
[2:07:46] because God's proving that you have
[2:07:47] faith
[2:07:49] God is proving his life through you and
[2:07:51] he wants you to know he wants us to know
[2:07:54] all of us that the trial that we're
[2:07:56] going through is more precious than gold
[2:07:58] it's more precious than anything that we
[2:08:00] could encounter here on Earth it's more
[2:08:02] precious than everything that we could
[2:08:04] encounter here because you know this is
[2:08:07] what gives us joy unspeakable and full
[2:08:10] of glory and what is it brothers and
[2:08:12] sisters it's that six sense that we've
[2:08:14] been talking about and I I believe I'm
[2:08:16] not even really doing this justice but
[2:08:18] what it's doing is giving us the ability
[2:08:19] to recognize that the faith we're
[2:08:21] talking about is not just a faith that
[2:08:23] we get from listening to a prophet even
[2:08:25] though hearing gives us Faith it's the
[2:08:28] faith of the Lord Jesus Christ that we
[2:08:30] get through the message of the hour
[2:08:32] understanding that we receive Jesus
[2:08:34] Christ
[2:08:35] today the same yesterday today and
[2:08:37] forever when we receive that Jesus
[2:08:40] Christ we now move into a place where we
[2:08:42] get that six sense where we get that
[2:08:44] Holy Ghost where we actually don't have
[2:08:46] our own faith any longer
[2:08:49] we have faith enough to believe to get
[2:08:52] us to church and that's one thing but
[2:08:55] we've got to have faith enough to
[2:08:56] believe in our
[2:08:58] Salvation if we have faith to believe in
[2:09:00] our Salvation we've got faith to
[2:09:02] actually make it you know Romans 5 I'll
[2:09:05] just read it for the sake of time Romans
[2:09:08] 5 vers1 therefore being justified by
[2:09:10] faith we have peace with God through our
[2:09:13] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[2:09:16] access by what by faith in to this Grace
[2:09:19] wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope
[2:09:22] of the glory of God Amen and not only so
[2:09:25] but we glory in tribulations also amen
[2:09:29] we glory in tribulations also my knowing
[2:09:32] that tribulation worketh patience and
[2:09:36] patience experience and experience hope
[2:09:38] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[2:09:40] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[2:09:43] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
[2:09:47] us
[2:09:49] you know we read in First Peter here
[2:09:50] this is the Salvation what we're talking
[2:09:52] about is this salvation this is the
[2:09:54] Salvation that the prophets they they
[2:09:56] inquired
[2:09:59] diligently but it was prophesied that it
[2:10:01] should come unto
[2:10:03] you all right one final point that I'm
[2:10:07] going to make
[2:10:09] today and and perhaps we can pick up on
[2:10:12] it later on we'll see what the Lord has
[2:10:15] in store I just want to read one little
[2:10:17] story in Matthew chapter 99 brothers and
[2:10:19] sisters maybe just turn there quick with
[2:10:21] me still have 2
[2:10:25] minutes I hope we're okay for a couple
[2:10:27] more minutes
[2:10:28] amen Matthew chapter
[2:10:36] 9 I think the Lord showed me this this
[2:10:38] morning and I just hope that it would
[2:10:40] just be an encouragement to to everyone
[2:10:43] because it just did something to
[2:10:45] me something that I knew but every once
[2:10:47] in a while while we just need to have a
[2:10:49] little bit of encouragement don't
[2:10:51] we it's a very familiar story Matthew
[2:10:55] chapter 9 verse one says and he entered
[2:10:57] into a ship speaking about Jesus here
[2:11:00] and it passed over and came into his own
[2:11:02] City and behold they brought to him a
[2:11:06] man sick of the paly lying on a bed and
[2:11:10] Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
[2:11:12] sick of the py son be of good cheer thy
[2:11:17] sins be forgiven
[2:11:19] thee and behold certain of the scribes
[2:11:22] said within themselves this man
[2:11:25] blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their
[2:11:28] thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in
[2:11:30] your
[2:11:31] hearts for whether it's easy is it for
[2:11:34] whether is easier to say thy sins be
[2:11:37] forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
[2:11:41] but that ye may know that the son of man
[2:11:43] hath power on Earth to forgive sins then
[2:11:46] saith he to the sick and the apy arise
[2:11:49] take up thy bed and go unto thine own
[2:11:52] house and he arose and departed to his
[2:11:56] house isn't that
[2:12:00] wonderful
[2:12:02] Jesus he goes over and they bring to him
[2:12:05] someone sick of the paly and what does
[2:12:08] he say to him
[2:12:11] first he doesn't say to him you know I'm
[2:12:14] God and I can heal all thy diseases he
[2:12:18] says to him first you you know what your
[2:12:20] sins are forgiven I want you to know
[2:12:23] that you are
[2:12:27] Justified you didn't do
[2:12:29] anything I knew you were here and I came
[2:12:32] directly to you and the first thing I
[2:12:35] want to tell you is that your sins
[2:12:38] they're forgiven
[2:12:40] you we're not even going to talk about
[2:12:42] your healing first we're going to talk
[2:12:44] about your salvation because once you've
[2:12:46] been sealed you've been sealed to until
[2:12:48] the day of your Redemption but I want
[2:12:49] you to know that your sins firstly
[2:12:52] they're forgiven you you don't have to
[2:12:54] worry about a thing could you imagine
[2:12:56] God coming and telling you that your
[2:12:57] sins have been forgiven you whatever it
[2:13:00] is that's ailing you now you can get up
[2:13:02] and go home can you imagine that right
[2:13:07] we've been told that today brothers and
[2:13:08] sisters yeah the invisible Union of the
[2:13:11] Bride of Jesus Christ you never did it
[2:13:13] in the first place you've been
[2:13:16] Justified before the foundation of the
[2:13:18] world he chose you in him to be
[2:13:21] perfect and Without Blame the Spotless
[2:13:25] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ this just
[2:13:29] just just made me so happy to see how
[2:13:31] Jesus did so I started to look at it and
[2:13:33] and I would recommend if you have any
[2:13:34] questions go and look at the gospels and
[2:13:35] see that was his sort of Mo first your
[2:13:38] sins are forgiven then we heal you your
[2:13:40] sins are forgiven then will heal you and
[2:13:43] he did it over and over and over why did
[2:13:44] he do that I believe he was setting an
[2:13:46] example for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:13:47] today today to show that there will be a
[2:13:50] person there will be a bride there will
[2:13:52] be a body of believers who will
[2:13:54] recognize that there was nothing they
[2:13:55] ever did from the beginning from the
[2:13:57] start it's all what he has done for them
[2:14:00] and you know we're not living in that
[2:14:02] timeline like brother mvin was showing
[2:14:03] we're not living under the law and we're
[2:14:06] not living under the time of Jesus we're
[2:14:08] living in the time of
[2:14:10] Grace it's all Grace it's all what Jesus
[2:14:13] has done for us the son of man Ministry
[2:14:15] he came and he did it all for us amen
[2:14:18] gave us the ability to recognize that
[2:14:20] through for knowledge you have been
[2:14:24] predestinated in love to be before him
[2:14:27] holy and
[2:14:29] blameless that to me just does something
[2:14:33] amenallah I'll call the musicians now I
[2:14:35] will
[2:14:36] and just remember brothers and sisters
[2:14:40] when we have the problems in our
[2:14:42] lives that he's forgiven your sins
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:46] AMU I think think that we have many
[2:14:49] times I know I have many times taken
[2:14:53] myself back or down to a maybe a
[2:14:55] denominational level spiritually
[2:14:57] speaking because I'm trying to deal with
[2:15:00] God according to my senses but we've got
[2:15:03] to push these senses aside and move into
[2:15:06] that place where all things are possible
[2:15:08] we've got to approach the Lord through
[2:15:10] that sick sense and when we do that then
[2:15:12] we'll get into that presence we talked
[2:15:14] about earlier where we just can't
[2:15:16] contain ourselves where where we know
[2:15:18] the presence of God is with us where he
[2:15:20] has drawn near to
[2:15:22] us I'm just going to read out of Hebrews
[2:15:25] chapter 12 as we close maybe stand with
[2:15:28] me this morning Hebrews 12:1 says
[2:15:31] wherefore seeing we are compassed about
[2:15:35] with so great a cloud of
[2:15:37] witnesses let us lay aside every
[2:15:41] weight and the sin which so doth easily
[2:15:45] beset us let us run with pain patience
[2:15:48] the race that is set before
[2:15:50] us every one of us are sinners saved by
[2:15:53] grace but let's stop looking at the sin
[2:15:56] let's stop looking at the senses
[2:15:57] naturally speaking and let's just press
[2:15:59] towards the mark for the prize of the
[2:16:01] High Calling of god let's run this race
[2:16:04] forget about the sins he said I forgiven
[2:16:07] you you're already Justified you never
[2:16:10] even did
[2:16:11] it you never even did it in the first
[2:16:15] place I just want to close on this
[2:16:17] scripture
[2:16:18] here it's verse two of Hebrews 12
[2:16:21] looking unto
[2:16:24] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[2:16:29] faith the faith that we have brothers
[2:16:31] and sisters he he he wrote
[2:16:34] it before the foundation of the world
[2:16:36] and then he gave it to us amen we don't
[2:16:39] just generate the faith we can't just go
[2:16:42] and buy the
[2:16:44] faith he's the author of it he wrote it
[2:16:48] Satan knows about it but he's the author
[2:16:50] and the finisher he started it and he's
[2:16:53] going to finish it we can't finish it
