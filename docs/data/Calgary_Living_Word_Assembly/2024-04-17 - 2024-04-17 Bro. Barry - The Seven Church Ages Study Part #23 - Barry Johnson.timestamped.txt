[40:43] to the house of the
[40:45] Lord another Wednesday
[40:48] service the saints of God are
[40:51] weary from the trials of this
[40:54] life yes
[40:57] certainly an honor and a privilege to
[40:59] gather together in his name though we
[41:02] just have a few prayer requests we'd
[41:03] like to bring Before the Throne
[41:05] tonight but before we do that we have a
[41:08] praise report Hallelujah and I'll
[41:11] probably say it again on Sunday for
[41:12] those people who aren't here
[41:15] tonight so bear with me but it's just
[41:19] significant this week we got a a praise
[41:23] report from Sister Becky
[41:25] hilderbrand someone whom we prayed
[41:29] for and you know this is the god that we
[41:31] serve brothers and sisters and I just
[41:34] felt so impressed to bring that
[41:35] testimony
[41:37] tonight
[41:39] because what we're dealing with is a
[41:43] giant and the Giants are in the
[41:46] land and they want to boast and they
[41:48] want to make us
[41:51] afraid but we don't
[41:53] come with sticks and Spears
[41:57] we come in the name of the Living God
[42:00] hallelujah this is Sister Becky
[42:02] hilderbrand's
[42:04] words she said good afternoon all I'm
[42:07] here to share the good news with you all
[42:11] I had a CT scan on Friday and that was
[42:14] last Friday I believe and this morning
[42:16] at 8:20 I received an email notice I had
[42:19] a new report in my Sask Health app the
[42:23] report States I have no cancer
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:39] you know this is a sister that stood up
[42:43] in the midst of a Wednesday night
[42:44] service she was probably sitting sort of
[42:47] between sister Shelly and sister Stella
[42:50] in that row with her husband in a praise
[42:53] service she was diagnosed with breast
[42:55] cancer and she heard a voice in her
[42:57] heart say stand up and receive your
[43:00] healing and she did it and she did it he
[43:04] did
[43:06] it many years later in
[43:09] Saskatchewan she gets the similar giant
[43:12] knocking on her door someone delivery
[43:15] guy trying to hand her a box of
[43:17] rattlesnakes and from the very start she
[43:19] said no way
[43:22] uhuh she gets the report and it says no
[43:26] cancer Hallelujah she goes on to say no
[43:29] swollen lymph
[43:31] nodes this is just beautiful that's why
[43:34] I want to read this tonight brothers and
[43:35] sisters because it's not just no cancer
[43:38] and and that's it and there's still side
[43:39] effects and there's other stuff it's
[43:42] very specific there's no cancer no
[43:44] swollen lymph nodes no infected
[43:47] lymphatics or anything else from the
[43:49] chest to the pelvic there are no tumors
[43:52] benign or malignant no swelling anywhere
[43:56] no nothing in any part of my body there

[51:06] again just a few announcements we have
[51:09] uh brother Nestor here this weekend we
[51:12] have a Saturday night service at 6
[51:14] o'clock and a Sunday morning service at
[51:17] 10: we will have the young peoples
[51:20] actually at the church I'm sure everyone
[51:22] saw the notice that went out but if you
[51:24] didn't the uh fin Financial seminar that
[51:27] brother Joel wants to host will actually
[51:30] take place here in the sanctuary and uh
[51:33] anybody that wants to come is welcome to
[51:35] come lunch will be served for the Youth
[51:37] and anybody else is encouraged to bring
[51:39] their own lunch and it will be in the
[51:41] basement of the church um we were going
[51:44] to host it at our house this weekend but
[51:46] as I'm sure everyone who is married here
[51:49] understands that when the wife gets sick
[51:53] uh it can be a lot of pressure to have
[51:55] people coming around and uh the wives
[51:58] always want to have everything just so
[52:01] and I understand that and that's why I
[52:03] said I'm going to remove all the
[52:05] pressure from my wife because she is
[52:07] really under the weather and uh we're
[52:09] just not going to have any pressure and
[52:11] I said to brother Joel if we need to
[52:12] postpone it or if we need to find
[52:14] another venue whatever we need to do
[52:16] that's just fine but we're not going to
[52:18] put pressure on my wife this weekend so
[52:20] I trust that everyone would understand
[52:21] and I do apologize I don't want to make
[52:23] things difficult for anyone I know
[52:25] brother Joel has put a lot of energy
[52:26] into this and a lot of thought and uh I
[52:29] don't want to be insensitive to everyone
[52:31] else's schedule either but I mean uh at
[52:34] the end of the day this is my wife we're
[52:35] talking about I'm going to be a little
[52:36] Vigilant so here we are uh it's going to
[52:39] be at the church I'm sure it's going to
[52:41] be just fine there's no accidents with
[52:42] god um obviously he wanted it to be this
[52:45] way so maybe that we could record it
[52:47] properly uh the portion that brother
[52:49] Joel wanted to so if you want to come I
[52:52] think it'll be a very good time um I'm
[52:54] not sure whether I will be able to be
[52:56] here or not I would like to be I wanted
[52:57] to be a part of it but I also have three
[53:00] boys that I'm looking after as well so
[53:02] we're going to see what happens are you
[53:04] happy
[53:05] tonight certainly excited to get back
[53:07] into the exposition of the seven Church
[53:10] ages um I started babbling before I
[53:13] finished all of my notes Here I
[53:15] apologize um we'll get into the book in
[53:17] a minute we have the Men's breakfast
[53:18] coming up May 18th Lord willing it will
[53:20] be at our house as long as nobody is
[53:22] sick again um we will be working out
[53:25] some of the other arrangements for that
[53:28] as we go forwards Sunday June the 2nd we
[53:31] have brother Dela adadon from Nigeria he
[53:35] will be here Wednesday July 17th we have
[53:38] brother Jack Duff coming here from
[53:41] Florida does anybody here know him he is
[53:44] uh you know him brother too wonderful
[53:47] he's a part of the eagle chat that Bible
[53:50] study that I've been a part of for a
[53:51] couple years now and he's just a
[53:53] wonderful brother he wants to come up
[53:55] and see B and have have a little break
[53:57] and I said whenever you decide to come
[53:58] brother we're going to make a space for
[54:00] you so tentatively we have arranged for
[54:03] Wednesday July 17th he's a pastor in
[54:06] Florida we will have more details as
[54:09] they uh unravel and remember brother
[54:11] Andrew Glover will be here we're going
[54:13] to have three services with him in
[54:14] August it's amazing that we're already
[54:16] like talking that far out I was looking
[54:19] at the calendar this afternoon thinking
[54:20] my goodness pretty soon it'll be fall
[54:23] and we haven't even seen spring yet
[54:25] anyways uh brother Andrew Glover will be
[54:27] here uh Friday night service Saturday
[54:29] night service and a Sunday morning
[54:31] service and the Friday night will be
[54:32] 7:30 Saturday will be 6 and Sunday will
[54:35] be 10 a.m. I'm sure that it will be an
[54:39] absolute blessing amen I'm excited to uh
[54:42] to see him again and just see what the
[54:45] Lord will do uh the special services in
[54:48] Edmonton the convention is being
[54:51] formulated and uh I know one of the
[54:54] ministers that's going there is brother
[54:55] Wayne lock
[54:57] he's going to be one of them and the
[54:58] other one I think is to be determined
[55:00] still so uh that's coming up as well and
[55:04] I think it is the weekend just after the
[55:06] long weekend in August I could be wrong
[55:09] with that we'll definitely confirm it
[55:12] once the flyer comes out from Brother Ed
[55:15] hammermeister
[55:16] you know uh studying the saman church
[55:20] age out of Revelations chapter 2 last
[55:24] week we uh we covered some ground and I
[55:27] think it's really good we got some
[55:29] Headway and uh there's just some real
[55:32] important notes that we covered in there
[55:34] that I just wanted to touch on tonight
[55:35] that are just they're kind of like uh
[55:38] nugget quotes that you hear quite often
[55:41] but they're just super important ones
[55:44] you know and I remember brother Ken he's
[55:46] the first one that said this to me that
[55:48] I heard it um brother Bram he says that
[55:50] no True Believer is any stronger and
[55:53] spiritually healthy and alive
[55:56] than his knowledge of and adherence to
[56:01] the pure word of God just a notable
[56:04] quote that I I I think it's just one of
[56:06] the great ones
[56:09] really um I'm just going to read a
[56:11] couple of these and then we'll get into
[56:14] carrying
[56:15] on you know uh the other thing that we
[56:18] talked about last week which I thought
[56:20] was really good is uh it's not really
[56:23] good because we talked about suffering
[56:24] quite a bit and it's God's plan for us
[56:27] to suffer we will not actually make it
[56:29] to the other side where brother Paul
[56:32] mentioned earlier in the song service
[56:34] where he will come and wipe away
[56:35] everyone's tears and we will be
[56:38] rejoicing with one another shouting
[56:41] because we made it knowing all of the
[56:43] tribulations that we had to go through
[56:45] to actually get there that is the
[56:47] character that he's working out right
[56:49] now and you know while we talk about
[56:50] working out that character what it is
[56:52] brothers and sisters it's a body
[56:54] change and remember these bodies aren't
[56:56] going to be changed this flesh isn't
[56:59] going to be changed it's the spiritual
[57:01] body that's going to be changed and it's
[57:03] the character inside of us that's going
[57:05] to be changed it's that old twin that's
[57:07] going to be changed into the new twin
[57:10] it's not going to be that old nature
[57:12] it's going to be that new nature because
[57:14] the only thing that we take with us is
[57:15] our character and my goodness what it's
[57:18] going to be like to have the right
[57:19] character to make it to the other side I
[57:22] I'm still a work in progress myself I
[57:24] don't know about you but I can say my
[57:26] myself I don't think I'm I've made it
[57:28] but maybe in his sight I have according
[57:30] to the word of God I know I have but I
[57:33] sure don't feel like it many times and I
[57:35] just think it's wonderful because what
[57:37] what I really got out of last week is
[57:39] that it's his elective love and it's
[57:41] nothing that we can actually change he
[57:43] actually elected Us in him before the
[57:46] foundation of the world to be the seed
[57:48] Gene waiting for that word to shine on
[57:51] that genetic seed and as soon as that
[57:53] happens there's a life that comes oh my
[57:56] I feel like I could get going here the
[57:58] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[58:00] sign of God's disapproval neither are
[58:02] the bright skies and Still Waters signs
[58:05] of his love and approval his approval of
[58:07] any of us is only in the Beloved his
[58:12] love is elective which he had for us
[58:14] before the foundation of the world does
[58:16] he love us ah yes but how shall we
[58:19] know we shall know because he said so
[58:22] how do we know he said so we talked
[58:23] about this last week nobody's ever heard
[58:25] Jesus say
[58:26] I love you his voice to our ear have you
[58:30] naturally speaking but to our hearts oh
[58:32] my you read his word and and you hear
[58:34] the prophet say his word my goodness you
[58:37] hear him say it all over the place he
[58:39] said so for sure he did and he
[58:41] manifested that he did love us for he
[58:43] brought us to
[58:47] himself oh my we're standing here
[58:50] because he made a way he brought us unto
[58:54] himself right and gave us of his Spirit
[58:58] placing us as Sons remember we said
[59:00] adoption and how shall I prove my love
[59:03] to him by believing what he said and by
[59:06] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[59:10] trials oh my that he and his wisdom
[59:13] allows to come to
[59:16] pass it's not easy brothers and sisters
[59:18] it's real easy to just say those words
[59:20] and let them roll off our tongue like
[59:22] it's just that's the way it is but it is
[59:25] the way it is
[59:26] and he's chosen to actually have it that
[59:29] way in our lives and there's nothing we
[59:30] can do about it except for count it all
[59:33] joy when we fall into diverse manifold
[59:36] Temptations because that's his
[59:39] will we're talking about that on Sunday
[59:41] his will being his
[59:43] word paragraph 31 here says I Know Thy
[59:46] poverty but Thou Art rich now we're
[59:50] carrying on from where we left off he
[59:52] says there it is again see him walking
[59:53] up and down in the midst of his church
[59:55] like a father he's looking down upon his
[59:58] family he is the head of the household
[1:00:03] he is the provider he is the protector
[1:00:06] yet he looks on at their poverty oh how
[1:00:11] Untold un oh how the untutored believer
[1:00:14] stumbles at this how can God bear to
[1:00:17] look upon his own in a time of need and
[1:00:20] not just stop it all just give in and
[1:00:24] lavish everything material upon
[1:00:27] them here's where you have to believe
[1:00:29] again in the love and goodness and
[1:00:32] wisdom of God this too is needful
[1:00:36] remember he admonished take no thought
[1:00:39] for the moral what she what ye shall eat
[1:00:43] or what ye shall put on your father
[1:00:45] knoweth the things ye have need of he
[1:00:49] who clothes the Lily and feeds the
[1:00:51] sparrow shall do much more for you these
[1:00:54] physical things
[1:00:57] are not the true basic necessities of
[1:00:59] your life for a man's life consisteth
[1:01:03] not of the things he
[1:01:06] possesses but that's exactly opposite of
[1:01:08] what this world
[1:01:10] says exactly
[1:01:12] opposite but rather seek ye first the
[1:01:15] kingdom of
[1:01:17] God and his
[1:01:19] righteousness not just the kingdom of
[1:01:22] God and his
[1:01:24] righteousness and all all the material
[1:01:26] Necessities will be added unto you and
[1:01:30] how many of us here tonight could say
[1:01:32] that he's held back anything after
[1:01:34] seeking his kingdom first and his
[1:01:37] righteousness how much has been held
[1:01:39] back from us he's looked after so many
[1:01:42] things in our lives you know what's
[1:01:45] what's more than our needs is our wants
[1:01:48] and and we need to be careful to
[1:01:50] recognize that just because we get our
[1:01:51] wants doesn't mean that's his Blessing
[1:01:53] in our lives that can actually be a
[1:01:55] curse
[1:01:56] it can turn into a curse very quickly
[1:01:58] it's a real fine
[1:02:01] line the people of God are not Material
[1:02:04] minded they are christm minded amen they
[1:02:09] do not seek the treasures that are below
[1:02:12] they seek those above and I think
[1:02:15] brothers and sisters as we as we speak
[1:02:17] on this tonight and and as we Ponder
[1:02:19] these words that's why we're here amen
[1:02:22] is because we're christm minded We
[1:02:25] Believe
[1:02:26] it is absolutely true the majority of
[1:02:29] Christians are not wealthy rather they
[1:02:31] are on the Poor Side it was so in jesus'
[1:02:35] day it was true in Paul's day and it
[1:02:38] should be true
[1:02:40] today oh it is not too true today for
[1:02:44] the leodan age is one of vast wealth
[1:02:47] where often the Criterion of
[1:02:50] spirituality is an abundance of Earthly
[1:02:54] Goods my how how rich the church is in
[1:02:58] Goods but how poor in
[1:03:01] spirit and we always talk about the
[1:03:03] church
[1:03:04] nominal blessed be ye poor for yours is
[1:03:09] the kingdom of
[1:03:11] God the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[1:03:15] drink Matthew 53 Romans
[1:03:18] 14:17 it is not Material it is within
[1:03:22] us a rich man
[1:03:26] a rich man is rich in God not in worldly
[1:03:32] things oh chres the spirit I see your
[1:03:36] poverty I see your need you haven't very
[1:03:39] much if anything to boast
[1:03:42] of what you did have has been taken from
[1:03:47] you you
[1:03:49] know isn't it interesting when you look
[1:03:51] around and you see we know how
[1:03:53] polarizing Co was UN precedented in in
[1:03:57] everyone's lifetime nobody alive has
[1:03:59] ever seen anything like Co aside from
[1:04:02] maybe those people who dealt with uh
[1:04:05] some of the World War II stuff I guess
[1:04:07] but never in terms of a disease where
[1:04:09] governments step in all around the world
[1:04:11] at the same time that's never happened
[1:04:13] but you know how many people were there
[1:04:15] I I I'm just going to speak honestly I
[1:04:17] was surprised how many people Christians
[1:04:19] Believers of this message immediately
[1:04:22] were were grasping at their rights
[1:04:25] wanting to stand up for their rights and
[1:04:27] wanting to look at the conspiracy and
[1:04:29] all the different angles of all these
[1:04:30] different things and and how it's all
[1:04:32] about control we're sheep brothers and
[1:04:35] sisters and brother badam says it
[1:04:37] clearly what did the Sheep do the Sheep
[1:04:38] doesn't say anything the Sheep just
[1:04:40] gives up his wool just gives it
[1:04:42] all take it it's not mine anyways if we
[1:04:46] have material wealth here it's not ours
[1:04:48] anyways one of these days someone could
[1:04:50] walk in and take it all and how would
[1:04:52] they do that all they would have to do
[1:04:54] is turn off our bank account because
[1:04:55] will not submit to a trinitarian
[1:04:59] doctrin that's all it will be shut off
[1:05:01] your bank account then you can't pay
[1:05:02] your mortgage bank takes your mortgage
[1:05:04] on your house house is gone cars you're
[1:05:08] not going to get insurance you won't get
[1:05:09] a driver's license all the different
[1:05:11] things they could do shut down this
[1:05:13] building all of our rights can be taken
[1:05:16] away brothers and sisters we have it
[1:05:18] good today but make sure that we keep
[1:05:21] him first that we seek first the kingdom
[1:05:23] of God and his righteousness in Our
[1:05:25] Lives because our righteousness if we're
[1:05:28] not looking for his righteousness I feel
[1:05:30] like I could preach on that I really do
[1:05:31] if we're looking for any other
[1:05:33] righteousness it's but filthy rags
[1:05:34] before him that's what the word of God
[1:05:36] says not just the kingdom of God and his
[1:05:39] righteousness brothers and sisters has
[1:05:41] to
[1:05:41] be the people of God are not Material
[1:05:44] minded they are christm minded they do
[1:05:45] not seek Treasures that are below they
[1:05:47] seek those above it is absolutely true
[1:05:50] the majority of Christians are not
[1:05:51] wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side
[1:05:54] it was so in Jesus day it was true in
[1:05:56] Paul's day and it should be true today
[1:05:58] oh it is not true today for the leodan
[1:06:01] age is one of vast wealth where often
[1:06:03] the Criterion of spirituality is an
[1:06:06] abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich
[1:06:09] the church is in Goods but how poor in
[1:06:13] spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is
[1:06:17] the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is
[1:06:20] Not meat and drink Romans 5 sorry
[1:06:23] Matthew 53 Romans 4:17 it is not
[1:06:26] Material it is within us a rich man is
[1:06:28] rich in God not in worldly
[1:06:31] things oh Christ the spirit I see your
[1:06:34] poverty I see your need you haven't very
[1:06:36] much if anything to boast of what you
[1:06:39] did have has been taken from you you
[1:06:42] gladly gave up your possessions in
[1:06:46] exchange for Eternal ones I just think
[1:06:49] that this is something we ought to take
[1:06:52] to heart and remember because if it
[1:06:54] happens it's is that going to change our
[1:06:56] walk with Christ is it going to polarize
[1:06:59] us to a place where we say no I got to
[1:07:01] fight for my
[1:07:02] rights watch it happen there will be all
[1:07:05] kinds of people that do Preppers people
[1:07:09] that want to dig a hole and hide in the
[1:07:10] den in the cave in the Rocks amen even
[1:07:14] that claim the
[1:07:16] message but I love what brother Bram
[1:07:18] says we're going to get into it you know
[1:07:19] what it it's the Holy Spirit or perish
[1:07:24] that's an exact quote that we're going
[1:07:25] to read I don't know if we'll get to it
[1:07:26] tonight Holy Spirit or perish that's the
[1:07:29] only thing brothers and sisters he goes
[1:07:32] on to say you're laughed at you are
[1:07:33] scorned you don't have material
[1:07:36] resources to fall back on but you are
[1:07:38] rich in spite of it all your security
[1:07:41] lies in him who is your shield and
[1:07:44] exceeding great reward your kingdom is
[1:07:47] yet to
[1:07:48] come but it will
[1:07:50] come there's going to be a time and he
[1:07:54] goes on to saying it will be an
[1:07:55] everlasting in one there's going to be a
[1:07:56] time where we will have him wipe away
[1:07:58] our tears from all the struggles and all
[1:08:00] the pain and all the hurt all the stuff
[1:08:03] that we've gone through on this side
[1:08:04] brothers and sisters amen it's going to
[1:08:06] happen amen he says yes I am mindful of
[1:08:10] your trials and woes I know how hard it
[1:08:13] is to get along but I will remember all
[1:08:17] this when I return to claim you as my
[1:08:20] own and then I will reward
[1:08:24] you and you know
[1:08:26] there's going to be a group of people
[1:08:28] who I believe already is right now on
[1:08:30] the earth and I'm sure all of us do
[1:08:32] believe that when they do actually take
[1:08:35] our Goods when they do turn us off some
[1:08:39] people will be here to witness that when
[1:08:41] that happens brothers and sisters what
[1:08:42] did Brother brandham say he what the
[1:08:44] Holy Spirit say through brother brandham
[1:08:45] he said watch the third poll then it'll
[1:08:48] be a short powerful demonstration of the
[1:08:50] spirit of God living through his bride
[1:08:54] body and I've heard people say I don't
[1:08:56] know if brother Bram says it but I think
[1:08:58] he might there will be a restoration of
[1:09:00] Limbs yes amen be able to speak food
[1:09:04] into
[1:09:05] existence we won't need to worry about
[1:09:08] anything because we'll know exactly who
[1:09:09] we are and where we stand amen now this
[1:09:13] is nothing against rich people this is
[1:09:16] where it becomes real treacherous too
[1:09:18] brothers and sisters there's people that
[1:09:19] are in the message that truly have the
[1:09:21] spirit of God baptized with the Holy
[1:09:24] Ghost who are wealthy people it's
[1:09:27] possible for a Believer to have money in
[1:09:29] the bank it's possible for a real
[1:09:32] believer to be wealthy but why are they
[1:09:35] wealthy it's not so they can polish
[1:09:38] their coins it's so they can help people
[1:09:41] that's the reason God makes Believers
[1:09:44] wealthy not so they can create a castle
[1:09:46] to live in but brother Bram he says this
[1:09:48] now it's nothing against rich people
[1:09:50] because God can save a rich man some of
[1:09:53] God's children are rich
[1:09:56] but money can be such a snare not only
[1:09:59] to those who have it but to those who
[1:10:03] don't have
[1:10:04] it way back there in the first age James
[1:10:07] cried out to those who were putting
[1:10:09] stock in wealthy
[1:10:12] people have not the Faith of Our Lord
[1:10:15] Jesus Christ with respect of persons
[1:10:18] James 2 verse one the poor there
[1:10:23] were the poor there were trying to
[1:10:26] butter up the rich in order to get help
[1:10:30] rather than trusting in God don't do it
[1:10:33] says James don't do it money isn't
[1:10:36] everything money isn't the answer and
[1:10:39] today it is not the answer
[1:10:42] either and it's not the answer brothers
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:46] sisters I've heard stories of very
[1:10:49] wealthy Brothers wanting to have
[1:10:52] influence over the church because of
[1:10:55] their wealth and if they can't have
[1:10:57] influence on the church then their
[1:10:59] wealth is not going to be applied to the
[1:11:01] church but what they're missing is their
[1:11:03] wealth isn't applied to a given Church
[1:11:05] geographically their wealth is applied
[1:11:07] to
[1:11:09] God but you can't by
[1:11:13] God he goes on to say we we have ever
[1:11:17] had and sorry I completely got in the
[1:11:20] middle of that we have more wealth than
[1:11:22] we have ever had and yet less is being
[1:11:25] accomplished spiritually I say Lord help
[1:11:28] us it is not with money that God
[1:11:31] works he moves by his spirit amen and
[1:11:35] that moving of the spirit comes only to
[1:11:37] a life consecrated to the
[1:11:40] word but you know brothers and
[1:11:42] sisters the other side of this that I
[1:11:45] want to mention by saying that I believe
[1:11:47] the message of the hour I'm baptized in
[1:11:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:11:51] I've got the holy ghost in my life and I
[1:11:53] don't need money in my life that's a
[1:11:57] lie you've got to be able to provide for
[1:12:00] your
[1:12:01] family to lead your family through the
[1:12:03] not hole sideways to to to put them
[1:12:06] through poverty to to let your children
[1:12:08] suffer financially it's a
[1:12:12] sin now you don't want to go and get
[1:12:14] your children a a a brand new phone we
[1:12:16] were talking about it on the way here
[1:12:18] young children in school with a brand
[1:12:21] new
[1:12:22] iPhone computers clothing
[1:12:26] cars CH children get their driver's
[1:12:28] license and daddy buys them a new car
[1:12:32] seriously I mean sometimes it happens
[1:12:35] but I don't want to throw off on anyone
[1:12:38] if that's what you want to do that's
[1:12:40] that's fine but what I'm saying is we
[1:12:43] can go too far one side or the other we
[1:12:46] can say that having too much money is
[1:12:48] sinful and we can say not having enough
[1:12:50] money is sinful we've got to be able to
[1:12:52] go right down the middle of the road
[1:12:54] brothers and sisters that's what I'm
[1:12:56] saying the synagogue of Satan brother
[1:12:59] bradam he quotes Revelations
[1:13:02] 2:9 B I know the blasphemy of them which
[1:13:05] say they are Jews and are not but are
[1:13:08] the synagogue of
[1:13:10] Satan here is a verse that will bear
[1:13:13] considerable thought not only because it
[1:13:16] is most peculiar in its contents but
[1:13:18] also it is virtually repeated in an age
[1:13:22] over a thousand years later Revelations
[1:13:26] 2:9 I Know Thy works and tribulation and
[1:13:29] poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the
[1:13:32] blasphemy of them which say they are
[1:13:34] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[1:13:37] of
[1:13:38] Satan to begin with the word Jews does
[1:13:42] not describe the religion of the Jewish
[1:13:45] people it refers only to the people of
[1:13:48] Judah and that has the same precise
[1:13:50] meaning if I were to say I am Irish born
[1:13:55] these people were saying that they were
[1:13:57] actually Jews real Jews by birth they
[1:14:00] were
[1:14:01] Liars they were not Jews by birth and
[1:14:04] they weren't Jews by religion if all
[1:14:08] this is true what were they they were a
[1:14:11] deceived people who were already part of
[1:14:15] the church they belong to the false
[1:14:19] Vine they were not of the true church
[1:14:22] but of the false church because God said
[1:14:24] they they were the synagogue of
[1:14:28] Satan now where is the Temple of the
[1:14:31] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters isn't it
[1:14:33] interesting because they're talking
[1:14:35] about a people that are the synagogue of
[1:14:39] Satan you're either going to be a temple
[1:14:41] for God or you're going to be a temple
[1:14:43] for Satan it's one or the
[1:14:46] other I think it just makes it so clear
[1:14:48] here now the word for synagogue is not
[1:14:51] the same word we use for church in the
[1:14:54] Bible Church means the called out ones
[1:14:56] or the summoned ones the psalmist said
[1:15:00] about these elect people in Psalm 654
[1:15:04] blessed is the man whom thou
[1:15:07] choosest and causest to approach unto
[1:15:10] thee that he may dwell in thy
[1:15:14] courts I just think it's so beautiful I
[1:15:17] was I was meditating on this as we
[1:15:20] listen to we're standing here because
[1:15:23] you've made a way
[1:15:25] isn't that
[1:15:27] wonderful he goes on to say but the
[1:15:29] meaning of synagogue is assembly or
[1:15:32] gathering this can be good or bad but in
[1:15:35] this case it's bad for these are they
[1:15:38] whose assembling is not of God but of
[1:15:41] their own
[1:15:43] selves Isaiah said of them Isaiah
[1:15:46] 54:15 behold they shall surely gather
[1:15:50] together but not by
[1:15:52] me whosoever Shall Gather gathered
[1:15:55] together against thee shall fall for thy
[1:16:00] sake and since these were surely against
[1:16:03] the True Vine God will one day deal with
[1:16:06] them in
[1:16:09] destruction just as sure as he will wipe
[1:16:13] away our tears those people will be
[1:16:16] destroyed
[1:16:19] amen now why do we have a people mixed
[1:16:23] in the framework of the church and
[1:16:25] calling themselves
[1:16:27] Jews the reason is this since they were
[1:16:31] Liars they could make any claim they
[1:16:35] wish they could say they wanted as
[1:16:39] though it were a fact and then stick to
[1:16:42] it and in this case they could be lying
[1:16:45] with a very powerful thought in
[1:16:49] mind was it not so that the early church
[1:16:53] was almost if not entirely composed of
[1:16:56] Jews making them the original members of
[1:16:59] his body the twel apostles were Jews and
[1:17:03] the later apostles were either Jews or
[1:17:07] prelit thus for men to swear they were
[1:17:10] Jews would give them a preeminence and a
[1:17:14] claim to
[1:17:16] originality tell a lie stick to it never
[1:17:21] mind fact or
[1:17:23] history just say it and keep saying it
[1:17:27] to the people and soon people will
[1:17:30] receive it now I'm not going to throw
[1:17:33] off one way or the other but I'm going
[1:17:35] to say you don't have to look very far
[1:17:37] brothers and sisters in media in in in
[1:17:39] the stuff that we've seen this that
[1:17:41] we've witnessed in the last decade you
[1:17:43] don't have to look very far and you can
[1:17:45] see that statement to be exactly right
[1:17:48] in society just in society not even in
[1:17:52] the church but here we have brother Bram
[1:17:54] the Prophet talking about this being
[1:17:56] specific to the church and the people
[1:17:59] who are a part of the false Vine who
[1:18:01] actually are the synagogue of Satan but
[1:18:04] mixed right in with the real church
[1:18:08] right just say it and keep saying it to
[1:18:11] the people and soon the people will
[1:18:13] receive it when I was reading that I was
[1:18:15] thinking oh glory to God get the Holy
[1:18:17] Ghost he's the only way the only truth
[1:18:20] the only life without him you will
[1:18:22] perish the Holy Ghost are perish the
[1:18:25] holy ghost or perish I'll keep saying it
[1:18:28] and people will receive it oh I love
[1:18:30] that I know he's talking about a
[1:18:32] negative context but I just wanted to
[1:18:35] smile tonight now did you catch
[1:18:37] something there isn't that the same
[1:18:40] Spirit right in the church today isn't
[1:18:43] there a group that claims that they are
[1:18:45] the original and true church and that
[1:18:48] salvation is found only in her don't
[1:18:52] they claim that they have the keys of
[1:18:54] the Kingdom which they received from
[1:18:58] Peter don't they claim that Peter was
[1:19:01] their first pope and that he resided in
[1:19:05] Rome when there is absolutely no
[1:19:09] historical fact for
[1:19:11] it and even her most educated and
[1:19:14] knowing adherence believe her
[1:19:19] lies Satan's synagogue he
[1:19:23] says and if Satan be her father and he
[1:19:27] the father of
[1:19:28] Lies then it is not strange that those
[1:19:31] in his synagogue are liars
[1:19:35] also consider the thought of
[1:19:38] blasphemy these of Satan's
[1:19:41] synagogue were not blaspheming God in
[1:19:45] this
[1:19:46] instance though that goes without
[1:19:49] saying this is kind of where I've been
[1:19:51] talking about in the past brothers and
[1:19:53] sisters but they were blaspheming the
[1:19:56] true
[1:19:58] church and what is
[1:20:00] blaspheming it's saying that the works
[1:20:03] of God the works of the Holy Ghost is of
[1:20:06] the devil that it's not true the
[1:20:10] persecution of Satan's synagogue in the
[1:20:13] true church the false Vine in the True
[1:20:16] Vine mixing it up they were
[1:20:19] blaspheming the true
[1:20:21] church certainly as Cain persecuted and
[1:20:25] killed Abel because he Cain was of that
[1:20:29] Wicked one we know we've gone over it in
[1:20:30] the scripture and and brother bradam
[1:20:32] talks about it in here that doesn't say
[1:20:34] that Cain was of Adam anywhere in the
[1:20:37] Bible he's not in the lineage of Adam
[1:20:39] anywhere in the Bible we know that Cain
[1:20:43] persecuted and killed Abel because he
[1:20:45] Cain was of that Wicked one that's what
[1:20:48] the word
[1:20:49] says and is the dead formal judaic
[1:20:54] followers Jesus said they were of their
[1:20:56] father the
[1:20:58] devil tried to destroy the Christians in
[1:21:01] the first few years of the first age now
[1:21:04] this same group The False Vine is even
[1:21:08] more strongly attempting to destroy the
[1:21:11] True Believer in the second age that
[1:21:14] Antichrist spirit is
[1:21:16] growing the group that in that inched
[1:21:19] its way ever so slowly into the church
[1:21:23] by its deed
[1:21:25] nickan ISM no longer fears exposure but
[1:21:30] is openly organized in a group of its
[1:21:32] own assembling and is coming against the
[1:21:36] true church in undisguised
[1:21:40] hostility and you know we don't have to
[1:21:41] look very far and we we've witnessed
[1:21:43] that even in the
[1:21:44] message I'm not going to say any more
[1:21:46] about it
[1:21:48] but you can connect the dots now when I
[1:21:51] say this was an organized Antichrist
[1:21:53] Church I am giving you the truth from
[1:21:57] authenticated history the first church
[1:22:00] founded in Rome we will Trace its
[1:22:02] history in the pergan age had already
[1:22:05] turned the truth of God into a Lie by
[1:22:09] introducing a Pagan religion with
[1:22:12] Christian names and meaning and I'll
[1:22:16] just insert this in here just read the
[1:22:18] Apostles Creed and if you ever want to
[1:22:21] see what a church is about just look at
[1:22:22] their about tab on their website click
[1:22:25] about and you'll see the Apostles Creed
[1:22:27] pop up in so many churches even the ones
[1:22:30] who aren't Catholic they're not Roman
[1:22:31] Catholic churches but they've got the
[1:22:33] Apostles Creed
[1:22:35] why because they're daughters right by
[1:22:39] the second age it was so Pagan though
[1:22:43] claiming to be the true church that
[1:22:45] polycarp came 1500
[1:22:48] miles at a very old age to plead with
[1:22:52] them to turn back
[1:22:55] they would not do it they had a solid
[1:22:58] hierarchy and a solid organization and a
[1:23:01] complete departure from the word this
[1:23:04] then is Satan's synagogue full of
[1:23:06] blasphemy in which were already the
[1:23:08] seeds of the doctrine of nanism and
[1:23:11] which would shortly be the actual seat
[1:23:15] or power of satanic
[1:23:19] religion why people think that you've
[1:23:21] got to go to the the World Church of
[1:23:23] Satan to be a part of it and they have
[1:23:26] no idea that it's actually a a a
[1:23:29] deception Satan has deceived the whole
[1:23:32] world and anyone whose names were not
[1:23:36] found written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:38] before the foundation of the world will
[1:23:40] be following that that sounds terrible
[1:23:44] to say it but if we're worshiping
[1:23:46] anywhere outside of the token brothers
[1:23:48] and sisters what are we worshiping under
[1:23:55] I won't go too far with that either
[1:23:56] tonight got to stay focused here and
[1:23:58] this is exactly right for Revelations 2:
[1:24:02] 9B does not say these people are of
[1:24:06] Satan's synagogue but says they are
[1:24:10] Satan's
[1:24:11] synagogue Lord have
[1:24:14] mercy this Spirit of antichrist is not
[1:24:17] new this is not something that just came
[1:24:19] in the church ages it has been here all
[1:24:22] along to get a clear understanding of
[1:24:24] how it works how it goes against God and
[1:24:28] takes over in the church look at the Old
[1:24:31] Testament and see it there I just love
[1:24:34] how brother bam does this over and over
[1:24:36] and over let us examine this Spirit as
[1:24:38] it was manifested in Israel as she came
[1:24:41] out of Egypt to be the church in the
[1:24:44] wilderness just as the early church
[1:24:47] started out under the pure Ministry of
[1:24:51] the holy
[1:24:52] spirit with signs and wonders and
[1:24:56] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[1:24:59] and
[1:25:00] interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[1:25:03] healing so in the days of Israel when
[1:25:06] they left Egypt they were under the
[1:25:08] leadership of the spirit of God
[1:25:11] manifesting in gifts God was the leader
[1:25:15] of the people actually he was their
[1:25:19] King he was a father King he took care
[1:25:23] of isra Israel like a man takes care of
[1:25:27] his
[1:25:28] family as I read this brothers and
[1:25:30] sisters I just want to say this remember
[1:25:32] Hebrews
[1:25:33] 138 the same yesterday today and
[1:25:37] forever he took care of Israel like a
[1:25:40] man takes care of his family he fed them
[1:25:42] fought their battles soothed smoothed
[1:25:44] away their difficulties and settled
[1:25:46] their problems he just busied himself
[1:25:49] over them he just buses himself over us
[1:25:53] doesn't he and they were the only nation
[1:25:56] to which he was truly God but one day
[1:26:00] they got to look and around and they saw
[1:26:02] the Philistines and other nations with
[1:26:04] Kings over them it caught their eyes and
[1:26:07] they decided that they ought to humanize
[1:26:10] their leadership so they wanted a
[1:26:14] king isn't this interesting it just
[1:26:16] struck me so powerfully brothers and
[1:26:19] sisters I've heard it many times we've
[1:26:20] all heard it many times they started
[1:26:21] looking around they saw the Philistines
[1:26:23] they saw they had had Kings but can you
[1:26:25] imagine what they were pattering
[1:26:27] themselves after pattering themselves
[1:26:29] after their enemies these were not
[1:26:32] friends these were their absolute
[1:26:34] enemies to the death the Philistines but
[1:26:39] this is what they wanted to do they
[1:26:40] wanted to be like
[1:26:43] them I say Lord help us not be like this
[1:26:48] world because the Philistines that we
[1:26:50] fight they're not not Giants roaming
[1:26:52] through the land kicking in our doors
[1:26:53] and taking taking what they want what
[1:26:55] they are is is Giants spiritually
[1:26:58] speaking coming to our houses and
[1:27:00] looking to see if we've got the token
[1:27:02] applied and if we don't then they will
[1:27:04] kick in our doors spiritually speaking
[1:27:07] so they wanted a king now God was going
[1:27:10] to humanize the leadership himself in
[1:27:14] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:27:16] they got ahead of
[1:27:17] him isn't that interesting that just
[1:27:20] takes me right back to the Garden of
[1:27:21] Eden Adam and Eve were to be married
[1:27:24] marri they were to come together in in a
[1:27:26] spiritual union and to be able to
[1:27:28] reproduce children and somewhere in the
[1:27:30] message I know I don't have the quote
[1:27:31] again but somewhere in the message
[1:27:33] brother Bram says they just got ahead of
[1:27:34] God that's all they would have
[1:27:36] discovered it eventually but it was a
[1:27:38] spoken word creation That was supposed
[1:27:40] to happen not an actual sex act that
[1:27:43] started it
[1:27:44] all but they got ahead of them Satan
[1:27:48] knew the plan of God so he put it in the
[1:27:51] hearts of the people to get ahead of God
[1:27:53] the word
[1:27:55] so when they approached Samuel and asked
[1:27:57] for a King Samuel was so dismayed that
[1:28:01] his heart almost failed
[1:28:03] him God had been leading his people
[1:28:07] through this consecrated scripture
[1:28:09] Vindicated prophet and he felt that he
[1:28:12] had been
[1:28:13] rejected he gathered the people and
[1:28:16] pleaded with them not to turn away from
[1:28:19] The God Who had carried them like
[1:28:21] children and prospered them and blessed
[1:28:23] them
[1:28:25] him as long as they had God he fought
[1:28:28] all their battles amen of course they
[1:28:31] had to go and stand on the front lines
[1:28:33] they had to get out of bed in the
[1:28:34] morning and go to work they couldn't
[1:28:36] just say God bless me and stay in their
[1:28:38] tents they had to go and stand in Array
[1:28:41] they had to follow the instructions of
[1:28:42] the
[1:28:43] Lord but he prospered them and he
[1:28:46] blessed
[1:28:47] them but they
[1:28:49] persisted they said to Samuel you have
[1:28:52] never been wrong in your leading
[1:28:54] you have never been dishonest in your
[1:28:56] financial dealings you have done your
[1:28:59] best to keep us in line with the word of
[1:29:01] the lord we appreciate all the Miracles
[1:29:05] the wisdom provision and protection of
[1:29:09] God we believe in
[1:29:11] it we like
[1:29:15] it it's this just trips me up when I
[1:29:18] read this when I I listen to it and I
[1:29:20] read it and I study it and I ponder it
[1:29:23] and furthermore
[1:29:25] we don't want to be without
[1:29:27] it it's just you know it's just that we
[1:29:31] want to King to lead us into
[1:29:34] battle now of course when we go out to
[1:29:37] battle it is still Our intention to have
[1:29:41] all the priests go ahead with Judah
[1:29:44] following and we will blow the trumpets
[1:29:47] and shout and sing We don't intend to
[1:29:50] stop any of
[1:29:52] that but we want to King who is one of
[1:29:56] us to lead us I say Lord have mercy
[1:30:00] brothers and sisters we don't want one
[1:30:02] of us to lead us the moment that happens
[1:30:05] we're
[1:30:06] doomed doomed it's got to be the Holy
[1:30:09] Ghost leadership over the congregation
[1:30:12] no matter where no matter
[1:30:14] when I just think it's sad to hear this
[1:30:17] the way he's he's he's he's written it
[1:30:20] you know we know that brother bradam
[1:30:22] said that in in uh trying to do God a
[1:30:24] service without it being his will he
[1:30:26] said that they had all the religious
[1:30:29] motion but still they were out of the
[1:30:31] will of God they never had it right
[1:30:34] because that Ark was supposed to be
[1:30:36] carried over the hearts of the Levites
[1:30:39] it was not supposed to be on a new
[1:30:42] cart but just trying to put our own spin
[1:30:44] on it hey trying to figure it out our
[1:30:46] own way make it sound good the devil's
[1:30:48] going to do that with us make it sound
[1:30:49] so reasonable and rational to our minds
[1:30:52] but the word of God is anything but
[1:30:55] rational and God said to Samuel see they
[1:30:59] haven't rejected you but they have
[1:31:00] rejected me from ruling over
[1:31:05] them be the same thing as a woman
[1:31:07] cutting her
[1:31:08] hair for her
[1:31:10] husband showing that she's just
[1:31:12] absolutely dishonoring her head she no
[1:31:14] longer wants his
[1:31:16] leadership how tragic that was little
[1:31:18] did they realize that when they were
[1:31:21] asking God to let them be like the rest
[1:31:23] of the the world they were rejecting
[1:31:27] him because God had ordained that his
[1:31:29] people act different from the world they
[1:31:33] are not of the world and they don't look
[1:31:36] like the world and they don't act like
[1:31:38] the world they are crucified unto the
[1:31:41] world and the world is crucified unto
[1:31:45] them 2 Corinthians 67 and 18 wherefore
[1:31:50] come out from among them and be ye
[1:31:53] separate it sayith the Lord and touch
[1:31:56] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[1:32:00] you excuse me and will be a father unto
[1:32:02] you and ye shall be my sons and
[1:32:04] daughters saith the Lord
[1:32:09] Almighty you see the one difference
[1:32:11] between Israel and the rest of the
[1:32:13] Nations was
[1:32:16] God put God to one side and Israel was
[1:32:19] like any other Nation right when Samson
[1:32:23] cut off his hair he was like any other
[1:32:27] man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:31] aside and the church is nothing but the
[1:32:34] world with God's name attached to
[1:32:39] it help us
[1:32:41] Lord the world and the church are all of
[1:32:45] the same lump just like Jacob and Esau
[1:32:49] were of the same parents but the spirit
[1:32:51] of God makes the difference you know one
[1:32:53] one of these days I bet they're going to
[1:32:55] take this book and they're going to say
[1:32:56] you're not allowed to actually talk
[1:32:57] about this you're not allowed to say
[1:32:59] these words I I can see it coming yeah
[1:33:04] to think that that really put the
[1:33:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[1:33:09] the church is nothing but the word world
[1:33:13] with God's name attached to it the world
[1:33:16] and the church the the world and the
[1:33:20] church are all of the same lump goodness
[1:33:25] sakes it makes it pretty cut and dried
[1:33:28] just like Jacob and Esau were of the
[1:33:30] same parents but the spirit of God makes
[1:33:33] a
[1:33:34] difference and here brothers and sisters
[1:33:36] this is the Crux of it I think tonight
[1:33:38] this is probably not where I'm going to
[1:33:39] stop but if we had to say one thing to
[1:33:41] take away from this service this is it
[1:33:43] this paragraph it doesn't matter if you
[1:33:45] call yourself a Christian doesn't matter
[1:33:47] if you call yourself a message believer
[1:33:48] doesn't matter if you say that you've
[1:33:50] been around for decades it doesn't
[1:33:51] matter what you call yourself
[1:33:54] anyone can do that the point is whether
[1:33:57] you whether or not you have the spirit
[1:33:59] of God in you for without the spirit you
[1:34:03] are a reprobate you are none of his
[1:34:08] amen so this is where I think it gets
[1:34:10] really really Pinchy brothers and
[1:34:12] sisters even if we're in a message
[1:34:14] church if we don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:16] In Our Lives we're the same as the lump
[1:34:18] of the
[1:34:21] world now I want to say for anyone who
[1:34:24] desires to get the Holy Ghost there's a
[1:34:26] purpose for that it's because you're one
[1:34:27] of his and you're not part of that lump
[1:34:30] children might not have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:31] but the parents better parents better
[1:34:34] not even be married without the Holy
[1:34:36] Ghost in their lives something's
[1:34:38] seriously wrong if that's the case but
[1:34:39] the parents are the Holy Ghost for the
[1:34:41] children until the age of accountability
[1:34:43] when God deals with those children
[1:34:46] sovereignly but there's no difference
[1:34:48] because we're in these walls here
[1:34:49] brothers and sisters just because we
[1:34:51] claim the message of the hour it doesn't
[1:34:53] matter
[1:34:54] but you take this word and put it on
[1:34:56] your lips and you're going to have those
[1:34:58] giants
[1:35:02] trembling he says not too long ago I
[1:35:05] asked a lady if she were a
[1:35:07] Christian she said can you imagine this
[1:35:10] she said to me I will have you to know
[1:35:12] sir that I burn a candle every
[1:35:15] night I love the way brother brandom
[1:35:18] says this what in the world has that got
[1:35:21] to do with
[1:35:22] it I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a
[1:35:26] Pentecostal I'm going to say this I'm a
[1:35:28] message
[1:35:30] believer yeah that hasn't got a thing to
[1:35:33] do with it it's the holy ghost or
[1:35:38] perish that's all brothers and sisters
[1:35:40] it's the holy ghost or
[1:35:43] Parish well starting way back there in
[1:35:46] the first church the people got to
[1:35:47] thinking and reasoning how to improve on
[1:35:51] God how can you improve on God
[1:35:54] the Deeds of the nians began showing
[1:35:57] themselves then a group formed they
[1:35:59] drifted away from the pattern of the
[1:36:01] word all it takes is just one word
[1:36:03] changed and that little leaven then
[1:36:05] leavens the whole lump he that offends
[1:36:08] in one point of the law is guilty of all
[1:36:11] Eve just changed one word that will do
[1:36:13] it and when Satan when that Satan
[1:36:16] centered group was formed it began to
[1:36:19] hate and fight the true believers
[1:36:23] insisting that they the aliens were the
[1:36:27] Church of God now I want to say
[1:36:30] something here about the message of the
[1:36:31] hour when you see that behavior has
[1:36:34] anybody ever seen that behavior in the
[1:36:36] message of the
[1:36:38] hour need I say more notice how
[1:36:41] organization breeds hatred it destroys
[1:36:45] Fellowship it makes
[1:36:48] bitterness but yet we had a prophet who
[1:36:51] actually was the one that we all CL
[1:36:53] claim to believe who drew the circle
[1:36:55] bigger didn't he the testimony was is
[1:36:59] that you couldn't tell his friend from
[1:37:00] his
[1:37:01] enemy and remember there's uh I I talked
[1:37:04] about a little while ago but brother
[1:37:05] Bram says he talks about his church in
[1:37:08] the Tabernacle there's people talking
[1:37:10] about some of the people that left I
[1:37:12] think Junior Jackson might be one of
[1:37:13] them brother Parnell might be another
[1:37:14] one they left brother bram's church and
[1:37:16] started other churches and and some of
[1:37:18] the people in the church were calling
[1:37:20] them uh dead birds that's a direct quote
[1:37:23] quot to dead birds and brother Bram said
[1:37:26] uh uh uh uh uh that is not right you
[1:37:28] need to actually repent for that because
[1:37:31] they're not dead birds they are Brothers
[1:37:33] and Sisters in Christ if they're
[1:37:35] following Jesus Christ then you just
[1:37:37] leave them alone because it's up to God
[1:37:39] to deal with each one of us but yet
[1:37:42] somehow somewhere along the way what's
[1:37:44] crept into the message of the hour for
[1:37:46] people to think that they can be bitter
[1:37:47] about people that they can actually just
[1:37:50] be bitter and separate what is that we
[1:37:53] know what is we're reading all about it
[1:37:55] right
[1:37:56] here notice how organization breeds
[1:37:59] hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes
[1:38:04] bitterness that is what myr means this
[1:38:07] is what Smyrna was full of
[1:38:09] bitterness a root of bitterness defiles
[1:38:13] many so more and more defilement was
[1:38:16] coming in every age would feel its
[1:38:21] scars my
[1:38:24] doesn't time fly when you're having
[1:38:27] fun I better call the musicians the suan
[1:38:31] church had drifted far from the original
[1:38:35] it had become
[1:38:37] hybrid it had hybridized itself the way
[1:38:40] Eve
[1:38:41] did you know that a hybrid is what comes
[1:38:45] of two species mixing the result is no
[1:38:48] longer pure like the original it's
[1:38:51] Mongrel well when e Eve allowed the
[1:38:54] Beast to mingle his seed with
[1:38:57] hers she produced a creature called Cain
[1:39:02] that wasn't pure
[1:39:05] human here we go again he was of the
[1:39:08] wicked one notice how different he was
[1:39:11] from
[1:39:12] Abel notice how different he was from
[1:39:16] Seth he hated God and would not obey the
[1:39:21] word even when God came came to him and
[1:39:23] told him you know what if you would just
[1:39:25] do like your brother but if you don't
[1:39:27] then sin lith right at your door and he
[1:39:29] knew full well what would happen but he
[1:39:31] gave him the space to repent to prove
[1:39:34] who he was to demonstrate his character
[1:39:38] he had to have that opportunity to show
[1:39:40] who he was and that's what happens in
[1:39:42] our age brothers and sisters we're
[1:39:44] living at the end of the seventh Church
[1:39:46] age beyond the seventh Church age even
[1:39:48] in the bride age but the age in which we
[1:39:51] live in is actually it's it's the
[1:39:53] manifesting time isn't it this word will
[1:39:57] bring to life every single seed and
[1:39:59] there's no way that we can hide what's
[1:40:01] inside of us that's why when we have the
[1:40:04] opportunity to get into the Holy Ghost I
[1:40:06] think it's just the greatest thing but
[1:40:08] we know that he hated God and would not
[1:40:11] obey the word and persecuted and killed
[1:40:15] the
[1:40:18] righteous maybe stand with me as we
[1:40:20] close tonight when we see that when we
[1:40:22] see that happening around the churches
[1:40:24] brothers and sisters persecution of the
[1:40:27] righteous my
[1:40:31] goodness we can see the
[1:40:35] nature I just want to say God richly
[1:40:37] bless
[1:40:39] you and you know I'm going to go back to
[1:40:40] that paragraph 54 I'll close with this
[1:40:43] if there's one point to take away
[1:40:44] tonight it doesn't matter if you call
[1:40:47] yourself a Christian anyone can do that
[1:40:50] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:40:52] spirit of God in you for without the
[1:40:54] spirit you are reprobate you are none of
[1:40:58] his amen let's just bow in
[1:41:02] prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:41:04] tonight I believe we can all say Amen to
[1:41:07] this word that we've heard we're so
[1:41:10] thankful Lord that you gave us a prophet
[1:41:12] Lord not because we worship him but
[1:41:16] because you spoke to us through him you
[1:41:20] chose him father to minister your word
[1:41:23] to us and how do we know that it's true
[1:41:27] that it's your word because it points
[1:41:29] directly to your word he doesn't try to
[1:41:33] change your word he didn't try to do
[1:41:35] that he tried to encourage us to not do
[1:41:38] that to take your pure word and to allow
[1:41:41] your spirit to Quicken it to us Lord
[1:41:44] father we thank you for your quickening
[1:41:46] spirit Lord we thank you for the dynamic
[1:41:48] power of your Holy Ghost and tonight
[1:41:51] father I just pray that each and every
[1:41:53] one of us would have your quickening
[1:41:55] spirit living out through US Lord and
[1:41:57] father if we have ever Lord done
[1:42:00] something to diminish that Spirit father
[1:42:02] we pray that you would just show us help
[1:42:04] us oh Father lead us and guide us give
[1:42:07] us the opportunity to get that Spirit
[1:42:09] back to where we know that it should be
[1:42:11] in our lives father and if anybody
[1:42:13] doesn't have that spirit and desires for
[1:42:15] it Lord Jesus Oh Lord let tonight be the
[1:42:18] night father it doesn't have to be
[1:42:19] another night it doesn't have to be
[1:42:21] another day if we have that desire
[1:42:23] father we know that you are more than
[1:42:25] willing to give us of your spirit father
[1:42:28] a thousand times more willing than we
[1:42:30] are willing to accept it father help us
[1:42:33] to deal with this hybrid condition Lord
[1:42:36] Jesus and just get ourselves out of the
