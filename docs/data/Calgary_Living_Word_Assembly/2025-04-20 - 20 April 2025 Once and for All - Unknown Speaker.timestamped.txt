[0:25] And then the stream of
[0:27] pilgrims made their way into
[0:32] Jerusalem to offer up the gold, the lamb
[0:37] and
[0:41] death. Atonement for their sin was made,
[0:45] but only for a
[0:50] season. Their empty hearts still cried
[0:54] out for a lasting peace and
[0:58] love. Then from Bethlehem he
[1:02] came. Remember there was his
[1:06] name. He knew the world would need a
[1:14] sacrifice and a million lambs could
[1:18] never pay the price.
[1:24] Once and for
[1:27] all. He walked the road to
[1:31] Calary, carrying the sins of
[1:36] liberty upon his
[1:40] shoulders once and for all.

[2:05] And the stream of mercy falls like rain
[2:09] from heaven's holy
[2:12] throne to everyone who calls upon his
[2:20] name. Though we all were
[2:23] sinners, he loved beyond our weaknesses.
[2:29] Though we are
[2:31] worthy, he came to suffer in our
[2:35] place. As his blood fell to the
[2:40] ground, our hope again was
[2:44] found. No longer are we guilty and
[2:52] oppressed. For he is thorough of sin as
[2:56] far as
[2:58] east from the
[3:01] west. Once and for
[3:04] all. He walked the road to
[3:09] Calvary, carrying the sins of
[3:13] liberty upon his
[3:17] shoulders once and for all.
[3:21] He conquered death
[3:25] victoriously, tearing down the
[3:29] searing
[3:32] wall. And the price was paid in full
[3:36] once and for
[3:40] all. He walked the road to
[3:45] Calvary, carrying the sins of every man
[3:50] upon his
[3:53] shoulders once and for
[3:56] all. He conquered them
[4:00] victoriously, tearing down the
[4:04] searing wall.
[4:09] And the price was paid
[4:11] in once and for
[4:16] all. And the price was paid
[4:19] in once and for
[4:22] [Music]
[4:32] all.
[4:42] Amen. Thank you.
