Rejoice take joy my king in what you [Music] hear Let It Be a Sweet Sweet Sound in your ear amen do you love him this morning amen maybe uh thank you musicians uh I'll just continue with the with the teaching and preaching that we prepared for over a year now so we'll just put things together and I know you cannot exhaust the word of God because it's it's overflowing amen and even the message of the hour with 1,00 sermons when you read it and listen to it it will always be a new book amen because Revelation upon Revelation but we cannot go beyond the revelation of the Prophet amen we know that but then the thing is it it's already revealed to him right and then it's revealed to us when we think that it's a new revelation to us and then you will check the message of the hour it's already there amen even BR Branham was will just speak it under the anointing and then he will just even don't understand or didn't understand what he meant right but then for us we were given this message for rapture amen it's a special message for us Class A people A1 of the best quality I will I will encourage you brothers and sisters that you are special I special we are special amen and uh maybe if you can put the slides brother just for a test uh it will be a part two amen so giving as an act of worship honoring God with our substance amen and it's a part two and uh while you're standing I don't want to keep you standing too long still the same scripture Proverbs 9 to10 honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presence shall burst out with new wine let's bow our hearts this morning oh Lord Jesus we want to thank you Lord for your goodness and mercy to us oh God we're just so thankful unto you oh Lord Jesus that uh you have elected us even before the foundation of the world Lord to understand these things lord it's not because we're good we're intelligent or we're righteous but because you have elected us you have sovereignty you have your you you have the choice Lord to to elect whom you wanted to but we know because of your forn knowledge you were able to elect us you called us Justified us and transform us according to your image oh Lord and we want to be transform this this morning oh Lord not only the the day uh going moving forward Lord but every time Lord that we we in our lives Lord that you will you will be in us and with us Lord so that we can represent you Lord wherever we go because that's your main purpose Lord to have a bride Lord where you can dwell in that can represent you Lord in this world oh God we love you and we glorify you have preminent on the service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we know that this scripture encourages us Believers Amen to honor God by dedicating the best of our resources Amen to him and uh we mentioned last time the sub substance means anything material possession wealth t uh time amen and that's the substance that uh this scripture is talking about amen and the first fruits symbolize uh the very first and best portion of one's income or harvest amen the verse yeah we we've been talking out there uh with brother Berry and uh there's so many scriptures that pertain to this even when we we pay our tithes we give our offerings it must be the first fruits it means the best amen uh uh that we receive from him and when we honor God he will honor Us in return amen and that's why we're so glad that uh uh we can take the scriptures we can take the message and it will be expressed through Us by by doing it then God will honor it amen but it doesn't mean I know bar can also preach and bar brandom preached that uh Financial blessing is not the the the proof that you are blessed right or or but but then the thing is it's a principle it's like gravity right anything that comes up will go down unless you're like uh starlink that will you know uh that will send the uh satellites right because he's defying the law of gravity but uh we are here if you put a ball up it will go down right right so it's a principle it's a law of nature also and spiritual law also that when you give you will receive amen and it's better to give than to receive right and uh we know eternal life is living for others yes but we don't want that to be ourselves as others it's better that we will be the one who will give to others rather than being the others that others will give to us right so I I'm I'm just saying that uh a a Christian right uh BR Bram is saying does a Christians need to work although you know uh God is coming right so so we know 1977 the the the the prediction is not a prophecy right it put uh it it put a lot of people to to bandid you can say Amen or or or or me mean or maybe Mischief or you know uh they didn't work they didn't send their kids to school you know because God is coming in 1977 because yeah bra Bram mentioned it but he said it's a prediction I predict he didn't say I don't prophesy it's not thus said the Lord amen right but then the thing is what what he's talking about is we must be prepared whatever that time is we need to be prepared and we cannot spiritualize everything as we mentioned last time right right how can we give if we don't have anything to give you can only give what you have right and we have a very good session on finance with bar Joel we thank the Lord for bar Joel's life amen and the ability to to uh to express or or to share his uh gifts gifts and talents right so we should uh recognize those gifts and even even those who are uh have the ability to preach behind this Pulpit we have yeah we we're thankful because we're under the five-fold ministry preaching the message of the hour the five-fold ministry amen and and and and and those gifts are without repentance gifts and callings are without repentance and talking about we cannot spiritualize everything is if you don't have money how can you give right so that's why those principles of Finance if we will have time I yeah they've been discussing the men's anything but then he didn't mention it so I have to research and check what they are which are very good I think I I sent some to to brother Jeff and they're very good principles and they're biblical principles but you cannot just limit them to five because even just Proverbs alone there's so many scriptures there that pertain to finance and it's one of the areas of Our Lives that need to be stable right amen one of of the main problems of a marriage is your finances not in in order it does I'm talking to myself because everyone is uh you know uh have this kind of issues somehow along the way but then the thing is what the what uh the the scripture is saying is honor him and he will honor us amen it's so good that uh you can see here the barns will be filled with plenty means uh it's abundance right that's uh verse 10 and then Joy your presence bursting with new Wine Joy the joy of your salvation amen new wine represent the stimulation of Revelation amen you know that uh when we were talking about the the the uh the two things that bar Bram is saying that you cannot uh overdo one is prayer right you cannot pray enough there's always room or there's always things that we need to pray for health right if if Finance you're already if you have a checklist okay or my finance is good okay check oh my marriage is good uh uh we love each other we we care for each other check something like that right so all these checklist it's good that uh we have to put them it's it's just like inventor ising uh having inventory on on what we need to do but but but the scripture is saying honor me and I will honor you amen and uh and that the second one is the importance of Revelation right you cannot overemphasize the importance of Revelation I might say a lot of words even bar branam has a lot of messages 1200 messages the scripture is so much with 66 words but if it is not revealed to you and me and expressed in front of us then we cannot understand clearly we we might understand what he meant it's just like uh an example of uh my my wife is explaining to me that oh the the house is like this the kitchen is like that and and the the the the toilet is on the right side the the laundry room is on the left and then when you come it's almost the same as what we have in our unit for example right she's explaining something in words and I'm trying to depict or or imagine what uh she's talking about but then the thing is all those words when I came to that room and then check what he she meant oh that's what she meant right you see how important Revelation is it means lots of words but then if it is expressed and you see it yourself experience it yourself then it's so clear unto us amen and the message of the hour for those who are not uh yet uh uh or or who doesn't know yet the the full message of the hour it's just like the compass pointing to the North Star right so the message of the hour is a compass that will point you to the North Star which is the word amen so we we have to know the positions of what the message of the hour is all about right he preached uh BR Bram preached so much that he pointed us back to the word and if it is in the word he said it's a warning don't take my word take the what the Bible said right and it's the same for us even Believers now that when you have something that uh you don't understand or it's vague go back to the source amen and what's that Source we have it in our cell phones right iPad computers everywhere that's why you cannot just rely on man's ideas or man's uh explanation of something because everything is open now amen we're feeding from an open book amen amen and we're so thankful unto the Lord that uh we feed on an open book revealed to us amen and that can only happen if we have the faith of God in us faith is a revelation right right and if it's revealed to us no one can take it away from us amen if God puts you in no one can take you out but if a person takes you in another person can take you out or the same person can take you out that's why following a man in this message we know already that it it failed amen amen and and God you know will will put something on that man a trial right right so that we will not look on that man we have to look on Christ brother brandham was has left the sin right he decreed so that Christ can increase it's the same for us amen and and we know the second coming of Christ is in a bride right now in this bride body we're waiting for the literal coming which is the the body change and it's happening right now we know but the culmination and when we meet him in the air amen amen and we'll have a marriage supper and then Millennium comes and then uh new Heaven and new earth and why am I talking about this because I put a fresh uh thing on the timeline of uh tights and offerings timeline wow wow tights and offerings has timeline I it's just putting things in order okay uh we we we read this before the first times the first time tithing uh appears in the Bible is in Genesis 14:20 right and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tights of all this is Abram Abram okay Abram giving tis to melkisedek and Genesis 4:4 to5 this the first offerings and Abel he also brought off the first Lings of his flat and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very rot and and his countenance fell so offerings you see both children offered they have good intentions right right but then without Revelation you might be giving something but it's not according to the word amen not according to the Revelation and God does not have respect on that that's why we have to be careful titing and offerings are strict things they are in the Bible we're not preaching H legalism here right we're preaching the word amen and it's the truth and if any person that that is holding up something behind the pulpit and not preaching you the truth then something is wrong with that preacher and we are obligated to preach the truth whoever speaks here he's obligated to speak the truth truth hurts amen amen but where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is freedom the truth will set us free so why worry if it if it hurts it hurts right we've been talking I think ver all failures for example failures are not failures in everything that we do it's just the opportunity to learn more their Lessons Learned in anything that we do including our work who doesn't commit mistakes here amen everyone commit mistakes right we we're not perfect we're still in this flesh so that's why we have to put things in order according to the word of God amen amen very popular uh slide here I know but then the thing is uh we believe in the end time amen amen and the end time means we are here right and we will cross over after Rapture we'll have Millennium and then eternity I this is not the topic though the topic is about the timeline for tithes and offering or the t uh where they were mentioned there are so many scriptures but let's put them together amen the first offerings as we we read it's in Genesis 4 4-5 so this is the first offerings amen by by date I put them so that we can follow amen amen it it's 3874 BC approximately how did that uh come from so if you're studying timelines in the Bible you have to refer mainly the person the best person that every Theologian even BR Bram was using before is a bishop Usher he dedicated his life in all this uh timelines and uh he has this book uh yes thank you brother we have a lawyer here so very good thank you brother for the backup so good that one is so good that uh he will give you an Insight so that you know where you're living in h what time you're living in because it's so it's so good we are still carnal and we are not Jews right we're Gentiles that's why the timing for us is based on you know historical facts you know we don't need to reinvent will but but what time uh are we living in right now so that you know the exact timing according to the Lord is look at Israel right he God's time piece but we are not Israelites We Are Spiritual Seed of Abraham that's why we're called spiritual Jews but we're not physically Jews amen so yeah Bishop Asher was the one who put all most of of of this uh uh uh time or or or dates but some are assumptions because even the date or the the the time today or the year today 2024 is also an assumption right it started when when you know it's a Gregorian calendar so they started it so we continued it so we're in 2024 based on our calendar right now but for the Jews they have a different calendar the Japanese they have their own calendar right the the the Muslims they have their own calendar so which calendar are we going to to check of course this is the isites condition they are the time piece but for us we have to just continue and then put things so that we will be warned that we are really at the end time right so 3 874 BC it's around maybe around maybe 20 to 30 year old when uh when when Cain and Abel were uh at that age because they offered sacrifice so it means they might be already matured adult right young adults when they're doing their uh their tights and offerings because nowhere you can find in the Bible all these dates amen so it's an assumption but what I'm saying is offerings it's about 2,383 years before the law so because the the concept here I'm trying to prove to you that titing and offering is even before the law and everybody's thinking that tithing and offering is in the Old Testament no it's not it's even before the law amen that's why we have to put things in proper order so that oh am I giving in vain no these are principles of the Lord amen and we mentioned last time my ending last last week is it will give benefits to the third and fourth generation and for us maybe I'm the first generation that is benefiting from it but my ancestors third and fourth generation before me were doing the good things for me paying tithes and offerings to the Lord that's why I'm having I'm being blessed right now so I'm doing it paying it forward so that my third and fourth generation to come from my ancestry will have the same benefits and we are setting an examples to our children anything that we receive 10% of that is an increase because it's like a gift to us although we render Services right we are paid but then everything belongs to God we already we already know that principle that everything belongs to God and when we think of that then it's so easy for us to give or to pay because it's not ours from the beginning amen we're just returning what is his and take note it's for tights and offerings it's not only tights right so let's go so it's a timeline 200 2,000 years before the law how about the tights the first tights Abraham it's in Genesis 14:20 and that date is 1913 BC approximately and that is again 422 years before the law right amen and the Jacob's bow this is about the Jacob's Ladder before maybe we should read it and then we'll go back to the oops Genesis 28 20-22 I will uh uh so while we are there maybe if you can open your Bible so at least it's a it's a study and then preaching if if if that's good with you Genesis 28 20-22 so these are these are instances in the Bible where it's even before the law and Jacob vow The Vow 2820 Genesis 28:20 okay and Jacob vowed The Vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and rment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God and this Stone which I have set for a pillar shall be with God shall be God's house and and all and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tent of thee so you can see here it's Jacob uh this one is uh in Genesis 28 so you can see about Jacob's L We Know bar Bram talk about the Jacob's lad it's just that ladder is just like Jesus Christ uh mentioning that uh to connect Humanity from God and that ladder is Jesus Christ himself amen just just for that one but what uh what Jacob is saying here is uh he made a vow that he will give all the tent of all that uh that he had that he will have amen and and and that's uh even before the law amen and uh we can go back to the presentation [Music] brother so that is 269 years before the law that is in 1760 BC and then the law came Exodus 20 which is 1491 BC right and uh in the Old Testament there are so many scriptures that are pertaining to tithes and offerings amen we'll not uh talk all of them but uh at least you will see the timeline this is before Jesus Christ came That's the Law amen and then Jesus came under grace there's so many scriptures as well about tithing and offering Matthew 23:23 look uh so many here but I have some in the presentation so we will read them this is in the New Testament after the law right so it means ties and offerings is still valid in the New Testament and how about even during the Millennium so Jes Jews Temple worship if there's a Temple worship there will be sacrifices there will be offerings and that is for the Jews but for us we will be under grace and this one is the when the temple worship will be restored bar branam is saying in 70 weeks of Daniel that will be for the Jews not for the bride because the bride will be in in the marriage supper and will be in the bridal chamber with the King we're the Queen of Heaven Again an encouragement to the Bride of Jesus Christ A1 people amen all right so and then even it will go through eternity because there will be healing of the Nations the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations we we will read some scripture uh some scriptures and and quotes after this so that we can see that the tights didn't start or or it's not it's not by law it's even before the law and will continue all throughout until eternity even right but then with us being the Gentiles we are because of the Jews uh uh not accepting Jesus Christ as their Messiah they were blinded and then all the grace came through US came to us amen it was bestowed upon us by Grace we are saved through faith not by works amen it is the gift of God it's a gift of God meaning we didn't earn it it's a gift it's an unmar Grace amen so let's uh let's read some uh we already read this uh Revelations 21 1 and 2 and he showed me showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations Nations other nations remember there will be other classes of people that will be saved outside that Holy City amen and we are in the holy city but these nations let's [Music] continue the future home the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations that is the kings that live in there bringing their honor in when they bring their honor in and Lay It Before the Throne of God just like the outside you see here I put it in Orange so at least it will be a little bit uh underscored the 11 tribes brought in just like he said right uh just like the outside the 11 tribes brought in every one of them a tent of Levi see when they bring their honor from the blessed land in that they'll reach from the Tree of Life break off a holy leaf or a tree of life LEF and they'll walk out together there's no more war everything is at peace the leaves are a memorial for the healings of the nation healing of the nation there's a meaning here it symbolizes or or the leaf symbolizes restoration and it eternal life available through Christ eternal life remember eternal life is not only for the bride we are redeemed but Salvation is General there are different classes of people we read it last Wednesday so many uh quotes in the message in the books that we are not just the ones who will be in eternity but uh the class being A1 being the bride of Christ is an election right it stands in election it's not by our uh by righteousness amen so so so it's important to understand that so the Tree of Life representing continuous spiritual sustenance and healing of all Nations amen and those nations are not the bride of Christ amen and uh we're thankful that uh for his election for his Revelation amen and and we understanding this is so important amen it it will position us teaching positions a Believer but preaching catches a sinner but we know we cannot be self-righteous we need to be righteous by the correction of the word amen amen we cannot be self-righteous thinking that we know all things remember the principle the more we know the more we realize we don't know amen and we need to be teachable and how can we be thought whatever is said check it in your Bible check it in your message don't re on somebody else you can ask those who are already 40 50 years in the message but then the thing is he he's giving you not the whole thing and is you know isolating coats then that's not the full message of the Hour the full message of the hour is Christ in us the hope of glory it means Christ the word the bride word in US amen amen so I will I'll have a lot of scriptures and quotes bear with me I hope it's it's okay with you amen amen and if it's a correction praise the Lord and if it's this these are not my words but it's the word of the Lord and the word of the Prophet amen amen Le Leviticus 27:30 to35 this is about tiing uh yeah okay so we have 1 hour amen amen I'm happy amen amen there's so many here but uh you know we have a pastor here that can take it and you know for us we're just supporting the pastor amen and uh we need to pray for our pastor amen it's a it's a difficult position here to to preach the truth like what he's saying it's difficult but then the thing is the truth will set us free therefore let's just be free amen what what keeps us in bondage is not accepting the truth and not knowing the truth ignorance to the law excuses no one well I don't know what amendment in that in the US but uh you know the we have American citizens here they might know but is it Fifth I don't know amen ignorance to the law excuses no one so it means we need to be informed that's the reason we go to church so that we will be informed with the word of God preached on exhorted on uh taught on right so we we need all of this and this is the five part of the five-fold Ministry Amen to to have a teacher also to have a Teaching Ministry also amen but the pastor we know is the highest order in the church he has the Sovereign uh he has the so uh I mean church is Sovereign so it means since we have a pastor he cannot be dictated by any other Pastor right we have that's an order in the church we have deacons we have trustees treasur and musicians and all those who serve bar bar barbar can can take advice from older pastors but that doesn't mean that they are there they are his Pastor because he's the pastor here so he cannot have another pastor but the other four ministers they must have a pastor and brother brother Branham gave an example there his Pastor is who bar Neville amen he's an evangelist is the he's a prophet of this age a Vindicated Prophet there are the the other four which is Prophet they prophesy they give dream dreams and everything that's prophetic but that that's not what bar branham's uh Ministry is his his ministry is to bring the word for our day is is the seventh angel messenger so a different ministry as compared to the prophet of of of Ephesians 11 okay so the other four must have a pastor right if you're a a pastor then you cannot have another Pastor your unless you are a pastor yourself right so you must be under that Ministry because an apostle is is is not a homestead he always go establish churches and then then go back to his home church that's how it is you cannot just go forever being a missionary you must have a home Church brother brandham clearly mentioned that amen right so that are we following the message if we follow the message then let's check what the the prophet said not what the other people said right so we just need to be free and free indeed yes amen so Leviticus this is scripture so we will read it and then we'll read some uh quotes and all the ti of the land all right all whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's amen it is holy unto the Lord so you see it's holy unto the Lord very holy that tip of everything that we own is Holy and it is the Lord's verse 31 if a man will at all redeem all of his ties he shall add there to the fifth part thereof I have to I have to uh check the Amplified Bible the tagalo Bible what does this mean on this verse 31 and you see how strict it is if you redeem your tith if you take what is supposed to be tight you have to give 20% interest on it that's what it meant amen it's the truth check any other check any other uh uh translations yes sir read let's read it again I'm I'm just preaching what it is mentioned then you can you can interpret it the way you want it it's up to you but what it meant here is if you redeem out of your tights you shall add the fifth part thereof what you redeemed or what you took back you have to put 20% extra on it so you see how important it is but this correction don't yeah I I hope you'll still love me after I'm just reading it though okay so it means it's just so that we will be in order because Perfection means there's no floww we cannot hold back anything even in our lives right if if if it takes if we need insurance according to the law we need to buy insurance for our house pour our car we cannot just bypass the law we are under the law I mean when it comes to living here same for our finances you cannot evade your taxes brothers and sisters they will be after you right but then the thing is these are principles so it means I'm just putting this again on the 3 second and concerning the tith of the herd or of the flock even of whatsoever passeth under the rod the tent shall be holy unto the Lord so you see here we we we tried to connect because right now we're under the money uh money system right we don't we're not Farmers so we don't give all the the fruit of our lands or you know but even your farmer today you have to sell you don't give tights based on on on what you you know uh you rip right so but maybe yeah in other parts they do that because they cannot sell right away so they give some rice to the pastor I know that so uh let's say they have 100 socks they will give 10 sacks to the the to to to the to the pastor basically or or basically to the church right so what they uh some are doing that but in here we always sell what we have so so for us most of us here we are workers or we are businessmen so anything that we receive we give tithes Amen in the form of money and our account will not receive crypto right so our account is our account is in Canadian dollar right even though you give me US dollar I have to convert it and when I deposit it right to the bank they will convert it to Canadian so let let's be straight on that that uh we're talking about money right ining Canadian dollar so verse 32 he said anything that passeth under the rod the tent shall be holy unto the Lord so let's go with the next one actually he meaning the Israelite okay we we we'll connect it later he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and the chains thereof shall be holy it shall not be redeemed it means for example you have uh you have a sheep so the ninth and then the 10th you found out that it's so good that it can be a a model ship and you wanted to to redeem it or take it back and you know I will keep this and then I'll give the 11 to the Lord me meaning still the 10 will be them but the scripture is saying both the 10th and the 11th will be his amen so you see how strict tithing is right so that's why we need to be careful brothers and sisters and we should know where to put our tights because it's also mentioned where you need to put your tights to amen amen and the 34 is these are are the Commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Si so we're talking about the law now which is in the Old Testament here but it's still prevalent and it's still uh applicable in our age amen I know it's a bit touchy but then we have to take you know we have to read all this right so touchy but uh that's will make us free amen what would a man take tithings for so you see I know I I I read this the first time last time but I will repeat it so that we can emphasize that it's very strict he's talking about melis EDC here if he never was born and never will die and was from beginning to end and never had no father or mother or descent and own the whole heavens and earth and all in it why would he take tide this is melkis EDC why would he ask Abraham to pay tights you see what a strict thing it is to pay tights titing is right every Christian is Duty bound to pay tight that's right never has been changed this is the prophet of God saying so it means he's talking about even Levi on the next one he he paid he paid tight although it's Abraham who paid tights but it's in the third and fourth generation right so so what what what I'm trying to say here is we need to pay tights where it belong to where where it's supposed to amen and then let's read more would it be wrong to use tits on church building P funds here's a touchy little thing for the church now no correctly tights is to go to the minister amen that's right in the Bible they had a box set at the door in the Old Testament when the building this box was a fund where the people put in there for the repairing you've read it many times in the Old Testament they kept up the buildings and things like that all the repairs on the building was taken care out of that fund but a tent of that a tent of the tis all the titing went to their priests their pastors yes TI thingss are to go for nothing else amen amen let's continue I know people take their tights and give them to a widow woman that's wrong yes sir if you're got if you've got anything to give the widow woman give her but don't give her God's money yes that's not yours in the first place that's God's if you sent me downtown to get a loaf of bread and give and you give me 25 cents to get the loaf of bread and I met somebody on the street wanted it you can read it I think I think uh it's it's legible yeah we can read it right so and I met somebody on the street wanted it something something else and I'd give him the 25 cents see I give them your money if they ask me for something let them get it over here in this pocket and give them my money but this is your money and a tent of it is the Lord's and Levi the priesthood live by the tent so what he's saying is if I have this pocket here on the right side this is for Tight money and this is my money let's say this is 10 and then this is 90 I cannot give this tent to any widow woman or any other person because it's God's money it's tight money I have to take it from my 90 here right right so because although everything Belongs to the Lord anyway but that principle is talking about BR Bram is any 10% of that money must go to the church where you are fellowshipping your local home church amen so that's very important BR Branham clearly mentioned that you must have a home church where you will pay your tithes even even before that if there's no message church you can go to a Pentecostal church Baptist Church whenever you go let's say you're in a in a tour or or or you're V you're you're traveling or on vacation you went to for example in Antarctica there's no church there maybe in EUR of course Europe we have so many any other continents except Antarctica I think we have already the church Africa we have a lot of churches so but before that BR Branham is saying if you if you go somewhere and you cannot find any church look for a church that preach the the Bible amen Christian church so that you can Fellowship although they might not be Believers but you can be a blessing to them too yes right but then what he's trying to tell us here because there's no message Church during the the time of bar Branham he preached to different denominational churches but now we have so many message churches that believe that believe this message of the hour so you have to look for a local church where you you you can fellowship and pay your tights to right so that that's what he meant here so it cannot go to to any anything else it's the tight money but uh there's a balance in there I'll I'll let's continue the tent is to be a tiing that's to be brought into the storehouse with the promise of God to bless it and approve he said if you don't believe it come and prove me and I see if I I won't do it see that's right the tithings goes into the church for the pastor and so forth like that to live on okay and the building funds and things like that is separate fund Alto together now that is a scriptural amen maybe let's uh I I didn't put this uh in the slides but then let's read it it's so nice uh brother uh it's so good watch man what what of the night 1958 11:30 what's night uh okay let's read it I hope it's okay amen we have time but uh this one is a it's a principle that uh okay it's a okay while he's looking for it it's 1958 uh 11:30 Watchman of the night and it's in paragraph [Music] 192 I'll wait for it yeah I think okay uh well I got its little baby paragraph 192 you can just click 192 sorry about this but uh then the thing is it's so relevant to to what we're talking about okay let's read it all together well I got this little baby hand in mine just in my fingers like that it was so little and I said Lord hear the prayer of your servant and by faith that I believe that you are I place between this demon of cancer and the baby's life the blood of Jesus Christ between the Killer and the baby the blood by faith I placed that and I couldn't say nothing else 9 193 I just turned around and started walking out the father followed me he said BR branam the Lord places upon my heart to give you some ttings okay oh I said brother don't think of that no I said I don't need money brother he said but I saved up some tithings oh a little money I forget now just exactly I believe about $50 he said the Lord Place it on my heart to give it to you I said I tell you what I'll receive it and then you turn it back and give it to little Ricky over there on his on his hospital bill cuz you're a preacher I know what it is what money means and you a missionary and I know that it takes money and you got a family and all these doctor bills place it right back on little Rick's bill so you see BR Branham accepted it right but then he returned it that's right yes so it means because he's a preacher bar branam and he lives on preaching and then it's a titing that the the person wanted to give him he accepted it right right but then he changed the meaning of that titing when he receive it because we have all our sovereignty as well we have we can do whatever what we want with our money if it's our money amen but it must go to the right person or right uh church or right location right gate GES this is a message gate there are so many gates they're saying Pentecostal Gates Baptist Gates or whatever Gates Right but this is our local home church amen so it must be our ties must be given to the local church and whatever is done after that we have to pray for the pastor for his for God's leadership we have to pray for the officers for God's leadership where that TI will be after right that's why is it bad to give a with a woman for example no it's not but then it must be given to the church first and then it will be appropriated accordingly amen right so we can but you cannot just say oh this is my tight I will give it directly no you cannot do that give it to the church God will bless it and the and and the leadership of the church will determine where it's required the deacons they have the you know the deacons uh they have a very uh good the uh position that knowing what is needed in the in in the body it's one of their uh what do you call it one of their functions the pastor doesn't even need to know that bar Bram is saying because he's dealing with spiritual things so much praying for us all of us but we have to pray for him too amen right yeah it's difficult right being a full-time pastor and so thankful we can support our pastor right but then when it's given already to the church we don't have any say on it it's God who will who who who who upon his leadership what needs to be done on that tiing it's the Lord's uh it's between the pastor's leadership and and the Lord amen and and we we we must respect that amen that's how it is so what what brother Branham is saying in this quote is you know he is re the tis but he gave it to whoever and and and there are many quotes as well when he said uh he paid also tights I think uh I might have it but uh I will I will be ahead of myself what what he he said is I paid tights he said but then I give uh I give tights to ministers as well and then the thing is he was as uh by CRA I I believe so that uh he cannot do that so he what what he did is he bypass it to missions right but but the point there is even bar Branham paid his ties even BR bar pay pays his tis right everyone is entitled because even the Levites when they receive the tis they have to give tights of tights tights of their tights that's why the tight of tights it's not common to hear it it's even against the voice of God right now because uh some are asking because uh they're saying the the tight of t of other churches they're sending it to Jeffersonville I know this is political but uh it's in in in the news but you know that's that's what they said they're feeding on there but then the thing is what I'm saying is I encourage what the prophet said we must have a local church where we can Fellowship live people that I can eat with delicious food amen good Fellowship we can exchange uh our experiences yes is important amen that's that's the encouragement from us and we believe that's what we that's why we're here we have a pastor amen we have other ministers and and uh and uh and officers amen and you can see amen let's let's continue back to the presentation brother sorry I've been hearing the there but uh so good to am okay oops okay we read that the tent is to be tiing that's to be brought into the storehouse with the promise of God to bless it the tiing goes into the church for the pastor and so forth like that to live on and numbers 18 20 20- 24 and the Lord speak to Aaron Aaron the office of the priesthood amen Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel you see Ministries being in the ministry is is difficult because you rely on somebody else's uh tiing and offering but we know who's our portion it's the Lord who's our portion amen when when when when bar Branham was I think he he was checking TL Osborne's uh office right and he has all these big buildings lots of offices and everything and then uh but for bar Bram he has only one typew writer and one you know secretary then he was asking the Lord Lord you cannot uh uh you cannot entrust me with this how come I've been faithful to you and then the Lord told him I am your portion amen right so it means it's not only material blessings am but then you know BR Branham was blessed abundantly especially by Calgary you know that the house in Jeffersonville was funded by by the by the offerings from Calgary amen so you see the Malachi three principle he will bless the land he will bless Calgary because of that so you see he will bless Calgary Living World assembly for for being faithful by honoring God Amen so you see the inheritance the Levites they don't have inheritance right but there is a distinction between Levites and priests in the Old Testament but now it's different so levite Levites they're all descendants of Levi but the priest though they are Levites they're descendant of Aaron Aaron the priest Aaron was the first high priest and only the sons of Aaron can be priests okay not not other Levites so meaning if you if you translate it here in in in in this day and age we don't have priest I mean other denominations they have right like the Catholic and uh and uh Orthodox they have priests AR uh Bishops archbishops Pope right but for us we have sovereignty and we were taught that way so we don't have any priest our priest priest here is the ministry and even the Levites like who served the serve uh in in the music because the Levites were the one who who put the tent bring the tent prepare sacrifices but they are not the one who will offer the sacrifice it's the priest that will do that so that's very theological you can say very uh legal or you can say in the law before but we're not under the law amen we're under grace amen so they don't have inheritance Aaron and and and even the Levites they don't have inheritance among the children of Israel and verse 21 and behold I have given the children of Levi which are the Levites all the tent in Israel for an inheritance why for their service which they serve even the service of the Tabernacle of the congregation so you see the The Inheritance we're talking about here is they didn't have any land in the promised land because when they distributed the Levites didn't have any right so this is what it meant their inheritance is the tiing of all the Israelites amen so let's continue that I know this is that that's uh a bit uh mouthful I guess but uh it's the word so we'll but the Levites shall do the service of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute forever throughout your generation that's among the children of Israel they have no inheritance but the Tis of the children of isra which they offer as a Eve offering unto the Lord I have given to the Levites to inherit therefore I have said unto them among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance so you see so titing is for the minister Ministry basically that preach the gospel and in the New Testament you can see here 1 Corinthians 913 and 14 do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so had the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the Gospel so who preached the gospel the five-fold ministry right so it means that's why we support yes sir we support tithings on on fivefold Ministry Although our pastor is a fulltime we have although we Minister here we you you can say we have love offerings when when we preach because why because for the scripture said Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that threaded out the corn and the laborer is worthy of his reward right and if you bless a minister who preached the gospel you'll be also blessed it's a it's a principle amen amen in discernment of spirit a new testament Prophet is a preacher we all know that just any Minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament Prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization which he should be in an organization here I am without one he doesn't have any organization that's what bar Bram is saying which he should be in an organization he WR I am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right every man every man or woman man means man and woman everyone ought to have a church home that's right amen you ought to have a place not just to float about from Pillar To Post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithes and somewhere that you help support the CA take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern the spirit and see if he got the same purpose in heart then you got Fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ I think that is absolutely true you see supporting ministers that's why we have visiting ministers here right because we you know evangelists who are full-time we need to support them how how can they live that that's that's their work full-time same as for pastors who are full-time we need to support them amen that's that that's how it is mention here and you must have a home Church there's so many uh quotes about having a local church so I I won't argue with that at all amen and that's why we're here tights of tights we another touchy subject but then let's just read it I think and the Lord spake unto Moses saying we have time amen thus speak unto the Levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord even a 10th part of the tight that is tight of tis right and and this your he offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the wine press so you see here the tent of the tent which is tights of tights it's an eve offering but then we don't do he offering here anymore we don't raise any part of any any you know the breast of of an ox or whatever or the fruit of the land we're waving we we don't do that that's in the law but what do we have now it's money we talk about it it's Canadian dollars so tights of tights can be an hi offering so we know every time maybe maybe most of the churches you can see that the offerings that we receive in a church is not enough to take care of the building is uh building uh uh uh expenses and everything so you see the tight of tight is said it will be an hi offer offering so offering means what it can be you know the needs of the people right not only for the building but then it will be taken from the tent of the tights of what we receive that's what it meant here if I'm wrong tell me but what I'm saying is our nature right we're all faithful in tight paying paying our tights but but how about our offerings we're not that generous right but then the thing is do we want to be blessed more if the denominations are tapping on this law as I mentioned before it's a law if anything that goes up will go down law of gravity this one is law of tiing and offerings it's a spiritual law what does it mean if you give more more will be given unto you in return so I know there's a question are you going to tight for the gross or the net or whatever how much do you want to be blessed amen right it's up to you right so I mean what I'm saying here is these are principles that we really want we want to be perfect in in whatever we know if it's already told uh been told us or taught to us that this is the way it is and it's in the scripture why not follow it we we don't want any our was the one who preached we can be a denomination of our own selves right if we think that oh this is how it's supposed to be because this is how I understand it no we have a prophet in the land he mentioned it right and and even the scripture is saying that so why not follow amen right so it means our nature is we are not generous on offerings but do we want to be blessed then offer and we will go to that so that's the title of tights it can be reappropriated although it's a tight before but like what bar Bram did it's poor hospital bills let's say bar Barber it's in his heart to to give somebody because she's in need or he's in need it's up to him right whatever he wants I mean according to the leadership of the Lord but then the thing is like like the church order and Doctrine like what we said any needs in the Church of course we have to protect first the members of the church church it's in the church order Doctrine and that's the job of the deacons to check what needs are those and the pastor doesn't even need to know that it's only they will ask the treasurer bar branam is saying do we have enough money to pay those needs right so it means giving offerings praise the Lord and we're so thankful we have we are charitable org it means 50% will go back to you amen amen I I hope it's not polit IC Al wrong when they will check Calgary Living Word assembly YouTube they will say oh that's the reason why you're giving but anyway we're giving because it's the principle of the Lord O of uh of the word right it means it just gives us the ability to give more I know other churches they don't have the the charitable org because they're thinking oh it will be known no nobody knows the tis here except me right and I have a vow not to dults even to my wife right because it's a sacred thing we have to protect whether you give $1 or, thousands of dollars God is uh is uh pleased amen so let's go to the next one offerings we have time I hope you're I hope you're not bored like a university class or something amen but these are principles brothers and sisters we need to follow this if we if we really want to to obey his Commandments right we need to believe his word that's the first and then you can obey and then you will see the manifestation of what you have followed what you have obeyed you will see it's it's a it's even a a you know it's like a challenge Bram is saying prove me if I will not open heaven right for the blessings that you cannot contain blessings doesn't mean only fin IAL how about how about health how about uh you know friends how about sitting in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus Fellowship the number one cause of uh issues right now is they are alone they don't have anyone to fellowship with amen and and even the young people why do they why do they live they don't have any body that are like them that's why we thank the lord we have brother Joel who's organizing all the youth they they have fellowship with one another so that they can talk about the things of the Lord also amen and and and being in in in this flesh you're still not mortal uh we're still mortal that's why they have to think of the the things of this world also that pertains to them like Finance is a good way to to start that thing as well right we have to put things in order amen so offerings but this I say he which Seth sparingly amen shall rip also sparingly and he which Seth bountifully shall reap also bountifully you see how much do you want to be blessed right I'm not pulling money because I don't need I mean God already provided for me what I'm saying is these are principes so that we'll all be blessed every man according as he per purposed in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver if we give and we're so cheerful God will honor it and it will be will will bless us more and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things so everything will be sufficient when you follow all these principles May abound to every good work amen as it is written he had dispersed abroad he had given to the poor his righteousness remaineth forever now he that ministereth seed to the S both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness amen so it's an increase when you when you give right it will be a an increase amen afterwards amen because you're sowing the seeds the right seed so you saw a mustard right it was said that the fate of a mustard but it's it's a very thin I think it's brother GIF to preach that you cannot hybridize right the Mard seat it means your faith cannot be hybridized cannot be mixed with denominational thinking it must be the pure word amen and with that faith if it is not hybridized then it can grow like bigger than other trees that's what it meant amen so you see you you we have to se the right seeds amen amen Luke 6:38 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over I know this is a song I think yeah shall men give into your bossom for with the same measure that you meet same measure amen will it shall be measured to you again so you see whatever you give it will be given back even more right that that's why it's the principle right amen 1 Corinthians 16: 1-4 this is about being generous to the needs of others if if we are blessed that's why yeah we we all gave some uh love offerings to those uh who who were in need in the Philippines for the blooding you know uh this one is a principle that now concerning the collection for the Saints right as I have given order to the churches of gal galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God had prospered him that there be no Gatherings when I come and when I come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters them will I send to bring your Liber liberality unto Jerusalem and if it be me that I go also they shall go with me so it means uh this this verse or or or this scripture is saying Paul is asking the the Corinthians to to have their uh you know uh offerings first day of the week then when he comes so that they don't need to gather then he will bring and then uh he will bring it to those who are in need in Jerusalem right Paul will not take this for himself he will bring it and then he's saying who shall whomever on on verse three whomsoever you shall approve by your letters them I will send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem it means the person that is handling the money it must be trustworthy amen right it we cannot just you know send um someone that is not trustworthy right that's why you know Judas is a treasurer of of the church it's about money so it's a very delicate thing as well because money we know money is the root of all evil but it's not the money itself we need money it's the love of money that is the root of all evil if you love money and you P you you pursue money then that's evil but then we need money that's why we have to put our finances in order right it's important am amen Exodus 23:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy right fruits and of thy Liquors the firstborn of thy son shalt thou give unto me you see we cannot delay what we give to God that's why he's asking for our first fruits the best of the best we cannot put God last amen it's a it's a challenge to us right when we receive our salary we need to give our tith some sometimes I I delay but oh Lord but I don't want to delay otherwise I have to give 20% remember that it's a principle it's a principle in the Bible imagine and where where to give the tights right so so it's so important brothers and sisters you see here I'm I'm closing maybe I'll call the musicians so at least it's good we have 10 minutes uh Abraham paid tis to melkis EDC melkis EDC is in his what glorified body at that time because he he communed with Abraham so physical physical God right physical God that he communed and pay Tis of all but melis sedc is God why would he need all those you see so but then the thing is for us now in this day and age where are we going to give our tithes is for those who are ministering for the gospel of the Lord right that's why we give it to the church and it will support the ministry and and the needs of the church so it means what what does that mean we're not giving to although it's attributed to God right what we paid tithes and offerings uh on that church but then the beneficiary will be his ministers amen right the F the the ministry but the offerings of course what we needed there whatever is appropriated as an offering it can be it can be uh discussed with with the with the members of the church that's why every church has is sovereignty BR Bram is saying if you want to preach uh Jehovah's Witness Doctrine then as long as everybody voted on it then we will preach you know uh Jehovah's Witness Doctrine here that's what he saying so it means there is a sovereignty in the church but the tits belongs to the ministry and then it can be reappropriated according to the leadership of the Lord whatever uh the pastor would would be led to right and and we're so thankful unto that and uh with with all this I know the more I studied I have a lot of quotes actually but uh we'll we'll stop on that I know Barberry can take from there and uh it will be a really a blessing to us if we follow exactly what the word say and we know sometimes we are also ask because we are here in Canada we came from a church for example back home right do we need to pay also back home or here where do you feed oh oh I also stream anyway no that's not how it is right whatever you give to your church back home that's not your home church then that's an offering and it can be taken from wherever you want from your pocket right but the tent is for the church so God will bless it so you see there are different Gates there are different things there are different offerings but they need to be properly identified that's why when you send your your your donations my request is put tithes or offerings or whatever it is right because for me it's difficult to I don't have the crystal ball but but I can determine whether it's tights or offerings right so but uh it's better there's a note there when you send the E transfers just put whether tith is this much offerings this much mission is this much yeah I didn't talk about missions but then missions is apostleship that's why it's still part of the ministry but then the thing is some other churches they put separate tithes offerings missions Church funds right but then the thing is what I'm saying is we don't need to be so critical on that because the the because the the Bible is saying about tithes and offerings missions can be reappropriated you know uh uh love offerings can be appropriated giving to the needs can be appropriated and it's with the leadership that's why it's so important to pray for the leadership of the church amen it's the Holy Ghost leadership in a man we have to pray for br Berry it's difficult position he's a good worker too he can earn he can earn by working but then he dedicated his life for us what if somebody ask you okay quit and then we will give you this this much will you accept you won't right but then the thing is it's a principle and we we must be thankful brothers and sisters and but the thing is we need to be according to the word always what is mentioned let's do it by the word not legalistically right but according to Revelation faith is a revelation brothers and sisters it's so important amen I will end but but uh it's good I think the onee preparation for a 1 and a half hour preaching times two uh hopefully you learned a little bit and I'm learning too but anyway so the thing here we're brothers and sisters we love each other therefore we want to be corrected if it is if it is wrong we want to be corrected and when we're thinking how come God is Not blessing us maybe we're not doing the right thing amen but again in balance it doesn't mean that you are not a bride amen but it means the principle in this world you're not following that's why you're not blessed right and what are those bless what are those principles I have five key biblical principles here which I wanted to you know uh to to add on or build on B Joel because I I enjoyed the his presentation last Sunday but then maybe for the next time when we have time but it's important those principles are biblical oh I'll tell you brothers and sisters maybe I'll just tell you as a hint a little bit we have five minutes but uh just just for a quick one and then we can we can do it more when when time allows uh next time but uh bear with me I I'll just read them they're so nice amen number one is about stewardship of God's resources we already mentioned what every everything that we own is the Lord's right we need to be good stewards where we put them properly I have scriptures and quates even but I won't mention the next thing is generosity en titing and offerings right generosity en titing and offerings so it means you're if you're generous we we we we mention all those give and it shall be given unto you more than what you gave amen the third one you must avoid debt and not be greedy amen we know owe no man anything but to love one another and in Proverbs 22:7 it's important the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender so it means as much as possible it's a good principle like brother Joel was saying last Sunday as much as possible don't owe anyone as much as possible pay your debts I mean even the banks because they pay a lot of they they ask for a lot of interest right so it's a good principle this is the third one the fourth one is working diligently and honestly it means you're working for the Lord whatever your job is you're working for the Lord no if the boss is not watching I'm working for the Lord amen that's why he will bless you abundantly with that amen and the people one is trusting God for provision when you give you know that God will bless what you gave and even the rest of it imagine he's just asking 10 of of of offering it it didn't say how much what percentage but other churches they say might be five it might be more but you can give more whatever is in Your Heart A Cheerful Giver remember the story about the the the the woman that gave everything that he had she had two mites or three mites right but the others are just giving some of their extras but God is pleased more pleased than that woman who gave everything that she owned amen so maybe maybe can we sing worship I thought brother uh sister Ellen will sing it but uh let's sing worship and I'll ask BR to come after thisen Worship the Lord [Music] reject your [Music] prayer praying makes you [Music] stronger I have never sin the righteous forsaken begging for bread and left to suffer [Music] have [Music] patience is aoid and see but God will [Music] do when you lift up your hands and surrender God will pull you through

Lord Worship the Lord worship the Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord amen so just uh last one I guess Genesis uh 151 brother Genesis 151 just uh as a final verse so that uh can encourage you even further Hallelujah [Music] after these things what's what things after his uh fellowship with melis EDC right uh his communion and paying tithes after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward you see it's an expression or it's the result of of his faithfulness in giving his tithes right to melis sedc who is in the flesh and isn't that a spiritual Eternal reward for us he will be our Shield he will be our great reward oh brothers and sisters if we know if we if we just apply all these principles we know God is behind us and we will be with him amen and uh I hope you enjoy uh all these things I know it's kind of touchy sometimes but uh you know the truth will set us free and we just have to you know be gracious one to another we don't uh we don't need to be we don't need to be bashful when it comes to the word right we need to preach the truth amen in its entirety amen Barberry thank you brothers and sisters [Applause] amen let's just sing that chorus Worship the Lord Worship the [Music] Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord Worship the Lord amen what a wonderful word tremendous to hear the the burden that the Lord has put on brother mvin heart and I personally believe that uh there's a part three on the horizon and you know if we were to wait I was thinking about it when brother mvin goes to Philippines and comes back again it will actually be another year so he's got some time to prepare he could have another year in January we could see that part three Lord willing certainly love and appreciate brother murphin and The Panetta family and all they stand for all they offer to the body and each one I I just have an overwhelming desire to say this morning I thank you from the most inner part of our being for the support of the church to be in this position it is not easy as brother mvin said but he is our great reward he is our shield and it's wonderful to see what happens when we just preach the word and not try and put our own spin on it and listen to anybody else no other human just allow the Holy Spirit to lead and people's lives change we see the Holy Ghost move in our midst we see healing we see salvation we see young people Desiring to get baptized and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit to me that's what it's all about brothers and sisters to see success in marriages to we could go on and on thank you for your support for me and my family for the ministry here for each and every one it takes a body of belever Believers to see growth and we know that's all that God is looking for is spiritual growth in each and every one of our lives and I can tell you I am growing I have grown and I fully intend to grow we need to continue growing and one of these days we will see a body change it's never been closer brothers and sisters it's not time to get weary and well-doing push aside all of the thoughts of the devil and if you want to know if it's a thought of the devil or a thought of the Lord if it's negative it's the devil period anything negative is going to be of the devil that's all we need to remember God richly bless each and every one of you um let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you for your word Lord thank you for the
