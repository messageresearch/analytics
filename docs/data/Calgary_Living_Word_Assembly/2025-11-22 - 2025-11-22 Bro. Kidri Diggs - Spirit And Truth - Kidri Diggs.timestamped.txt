[21:39] comfort.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Father,
[21:40] &gt;&gt; that's why we're raising our hands. So
[21:41] God, meet my needs. I believe that's
[21:43] your prayer.

[49:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; For Lord, you allow us as amateur
[49:12] creators to create an atmosphere where
[49:14] you
[49:15] &gt;&gt; where we can feel the moving of your
[49:17] spirit, Lord.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It takes us beyond this rim of the
[49:22] flesh, Lord. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And Lord, that this seek sense may be

[49:32] sense of faith, Lord.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And we can reach out and grab it because
[49:37] the healer, the deliverer, the allseeing
[49:41] eye, our God Jesus Christ,
[49:43] &gt;&gt; is in the midst of his people.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we lay everything else aside
[49:48] right now and concentrate on you, Lord.
[49:50] Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; For we know that we're in the presence
[49:52] of Jehovah,
[49:54] &gt;&gt; God who dwells with this family,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; and Lord, we're your children, Lord, the
[50:00] sheep of your pasture, Lord. And we pray
[50:02] tonight, Lord, that you would bless your
[50:04] people through your word, Lord.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; not the thoughts of a man, the actions
[50:08] of a man, the mind of a man, but Lord,
[50:11] we want your thoughts, Lord.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to move according as you
[50:17] would have us to move, Lord.
[50:20] And Lord, we pray that the Holy Spirit
[50:22] would dominate the service,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; dominate our minds, our spirits. Lord,
[50:27] &gt;&gt; refresh our souls.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive us for anything that's not
[50:32] like you, Lord.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; And Lord, even in this atmosphere, Lord,
[50:37] there are different needs, Lord. There
[50:39] are different things that we are seeking
[50:41] you for, Lord.
[50:44] And Lord, your presence is so real, Lord
[50:46] God, that we believe right now we can
[50:48] just ask
[50:49] &gt;&gt; and it shall be given.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Seeking we shall find. Knock and the
[50:54] door shall be open.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you told us to ask that our
[50:58] joys may be full.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's your word and we stand on
[51:03] your word tonight.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, bless each and every heart here,
[51:06] Lord. Lord, clear the minds of your
[51:09] people that may be troubled, Lord. Lord,
[51:12] heal the bodies of those that may be
[51:14] feeble, Lord.

[51:18] presence.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, bless this church. Lord, bless the
[51:21] pastor, Lord, this family, Lord, his
[51:24] church family, Lord, all those connected
[51:25] to the ministry.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you let the sheep follow him
[51:30] as he follows Christ. Lord,
[51:34] &gt;&gt; we love you and we thank you in the
[51:36] wonderful name of Jesus Christ.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; The church say amen. Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." Again.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in Calgary again.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for the mercy he's
[51:54] given us to come this way. Amen. And you
[51:58] know, it's in season because it's
[51:59] getting cold.

[52:05] appreciate you all. We certainly
[52:07] appreciate brother Barry. Amen. His
[52:09] precious brother. appreciate him. Amen.
[52:12] Amen. How many love the Lord tonight?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I really [music] trust and
[52:19] believe that the service is ordained of
[52:22] God.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; So many things that have taken place
[52:25] already that's just confirmed things to
[52:27] me.
[52:29] Even with the opening song, the opening
[52:32] song was the last song s song song in
[52:34] the last service I was in.
[52:37] and and that's just something personal
[52:40] for me. So I just know truly believe
[52:42] that God is doing something
[52:45] &gt;&gt; in our midst. So let's let him have our
[52:48] expectation
[52:50] &gt;&gt; and let's take this beyond just a
[52:52] Saturday night
[52:54] &gt;&gt; and it's a gathering with God and his
[52:56] people. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, Amen. Let's
[52:59] turn to um St. John chapter 16.
[53:06] St. John chapter 16.
[53:12] Praise the Lord.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; St. John 16 and um
[53:25] let's start reading at uh just to make
[53:28] the reading short. Let's let's start at
[53:30] verse 12.
[53:35] If you have say amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; St. John 16:12, the Bible says, "I have
[53:42] yet many things to say unto you, but ye
[53:45] cannot bear them now. How be it, when
[53:49] he, the Spirit of truth, is come. He
[53:52] will guide you into all truth. For he
[53:56] shall not speak of himself, but
[53:58] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[54:01] speak, and he will show you things to
[54:04] come. He shall glorify me, for he shall
[54:08] receive
[54:10] of mine,
[54:12] and shall show and shall show it unto
[54:15] you. All things that the Father hath are
[54:18] mine. Therefore said I, that he shall
[54:22] take of mine,
[54:24] and shall show it unto you. A little
[54:27] while ye shall not see me, and again a
[54:30] little while ye shall see me, because I
[54:32] go to the Father.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats
[54:43] as you're sitting.
[54:47] Let's turn over to um
[54:50] St. John chapter 8.
[54:55] St. John
[54:58] chapter 8
[55:09] and I think I want to read at start
[55:12] reading at verse 29 I think. Let me see.
[55:28] Let's start at verse 30.
[55:32] St. John 8 and verse 30. The Bible says,
[55:35] "As he spake these words, many believe
[55:38] on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews
[55:41] which believed on him, "If ye continue
[55:44] in my word, then are ye my disciples
[55:47] indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and
[55:50] the truth shall make you free." [snorts]
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to his word.
[55:59] Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I
[56:00] want to use for a subject, spirit and
[56:03] truth.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spirit and truth. What a
[56:07] combination.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it comes to the Lord, you
[56:12] know, and that trickles down to his
[56:14] bride, spirit, and truth. But we we we
[56:19] got some things we want to examine
[56:20] tonight.
[56:22] Uh when we look right here in the Bible,
[56:26] the Bible says, "How be it when the
[56:28] spirit of truth cometh." Hallelujah.
[56:30] Now, we know that when we look at this
[56:33] right here,
[56:36] we want to find out what kind of spirit
[56:39] he's talking about.
[56:41] Now, yeah, we say Holy Spirit. Amen. But
[56:44] when we look at this church, spirit is
[56:48] not something just out there in the air.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Spirit is something that's real.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "But brother D, what you
[56:54] talking about?" The Bible says that God
[56:56] is a what?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Spirit. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; So for us to have any kind of spirit
[57:01] here tonight, we want God's spirit.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Because behind everything, there is a
[57:07] spirit.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Behind your worship tonight, there was a
[57:11] spirit.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; What kind of spirit?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; That's the question we want to answer.
[57:16] Hallelujah.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now, as you s songs, as you worship or
[57:20] whatever, there was a spirit behind it.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Now, we're believing and trusting that
[57:25] God is is is in our midst. that God is
[57:28] the spirit behind us. But then he says
[57:32] when the spirit of uh truth is come,
[57:35] listen, that spirit is [screaming] a
[57:38] person.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me, church?
[57:43] &gt;&gt; So if there's a spirit in here tonight,
[57:45] it has to be a person.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; There's only two spirits that can be in
[57:50] this room. Hallelujah. All of us are
[57:52] housing one of them. It's either the
[57:54] spirit of God or the spirit of the
[57:56] enemy. Now I want to believe that the
[57:58] spirit of God is behind me. Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Because he says hallelujah. Now, now
[58:04] when we dealing with his spirit, he says
[58:07] his spirit uh uh of truth is to come. He
[58:11] will guide you into all truth.
[58:14] Hallelujah.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; First thing about the right kind of
[58:16] spirit, it'll give you truth.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people say that they got
[58:21] truth. We can identify that by the kind
[58:23] of spirit that's in their life.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of people say, "I love
[58:27] God. I believe in God." But what kind of
[58:30] spirit is behind that?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Some people say they love God and they
[58:34] still doing all kind of things in the
[58:35] world. That ain't the right kind of
[58:37] spirit.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we may see things in
[58:41] church and people want to do things in
[58:43] church, but what's behind that spirit?
[58:45] Hallelujah.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; He said that spirit will guide us into
[58:49] what? All truth. Not partial.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just being able to speak in
[58:55] tongues.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, there we go. Praise God.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just being able to speak
[59:08] in tongues or just being able to come to
[59:11] church or pay tithe. Everybody can do
[59:14] that.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; But the spirit behind it is supposed to
[59:19] be what? Speaking of he.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; He says when he,
[59:24] [clears throat and snorts] the spirit of
[59:25] truth will come, it will guide us into
[59:28] all things.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; All things, good things, true things.
[59:33] Amen. Hallelujah. So, how do you know
[59:35] you got the right spirit?
[59:38] Truth.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; How do you know you got truth? It'll
[59:45] reveal the spirit.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; The right spirit. Hallelujah.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody with me?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Now listen. He says, "For he shall not
[59:56] speak of himself." Now, I want you to
[59:59] examine me tonight as I preach to see if
[1:00:02] I got the right spirit or not.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Because first of all, for any man of God
[1:00:06] to get back here behind the pull pit,
[1:00:09] he's not supposed to be uplifting
[1:00:11] himself.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; He's not supposed to be speaking of
[1:00:14] himself, but he shall not speak of
[1:00:17] himself. Hallelujah. So, what does the
[1:00:19] right kind of spirit will do? It'll
[1:00:21] always bring us back to who? God.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; That's how you know you're in the right
[1:00:26] church. That's how you know the right
[1:00:28] spirit is there. Because the ministry
[1:00:31] will always bring you back to God.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; If it's the right spirit, it won't speak
[1:00:41] of you. Hallelujah. If you're singing a
[1:00:44] special, [screaming] it won't exalt you.
[1:00:46] It'll exalt God.
[1:00:48] That's right.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; So, the right spirit will always speak
[1:00:52] of who? Him.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I just love how the Bible gives us all
[1:01:02] the answers.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; How do we know Brother Brandon was a
[1:01:07] divine prophet? Cuz he didn't speak of
[1:01:09] himself.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; He always spoke of who? Him.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Always bought the church. you and I back
[1:01:18] to Christ.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; I haven't found
[1:01:24] one time in my own personal studies
[1:01:27] where the prophet wanted me to follow
[1:01:29] him.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I got at least one amen. Praise the
[1:01:35] Lord. And that came from the pastor. So
[1:01:36] I know he preaching it to you. Everybody
[1:01:39] else might be,
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; who are you following?
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; We're following Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was following who? Him.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, if if if it's the right
[1:01:53] spirit, it will always bring you back to
[1:01:55] him."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not the man, but the spirit.
[1:01:59] What spirit? The spirit of God.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So, our worship should bring us back to
[1:02:07] God.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Our life should bring us back to God.
[1:02:11] Our prayer should bring us back to God.
[1:02:13] Everything we do under [screaming] the
[1:02:15] spirit should demonstrate who we serve.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Woo. I feel good tonight.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:26] Listen, let's keep reading. He says,
[1:02:30] "But whatsoever he shall hear, that
[1:02:32] shall he speak,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; and he will show you things to come."
[1:02:36] Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Now, just to for our own benefit to say
[1:02:41] that we're in truth, our message,
[1:02:44] hallelujah, which is the Bible revealed,
[1:02:47] speaks of what? Truth.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; How do we know it's truth? Because it's
[1:02:51] showing us prophecy fulfilled.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Look around. US, Canada, wherever you
[1:02:58] go, prophecy, the Bible is being
[1:03:00] revealed for the Bible's being
[1:03:03] fulfilled. That means we have truth.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Look at the state of the world. Look at
[1:03:09] the Gentiles cup of iniquity. It's full.
[1:03:12] The Bible tells us of that. We know that
[1:03:14] we are in truth. How? Because we got the
[1:03:17] right interpretation.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; We're not in a day where well, you know,
[1:03:21] they ask ministers questions and I've
[1:03:23] seen this. They've asked ministers
[1:03:25] questions say, "What do you think about
[1:03:26] homosexuality?" Well, it's not God's
[1:03:29] best.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Huh? It's not God's best. God ain't got
[1:03:35] nothing to do with it.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, we're not H. We don't
[1:03:41] have a gospel that will compromise with
[1:03:44] truth.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you see people leave.
[1:03:46] Hallelujah.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; But listen. I'm going to go back. He
[1:03:56] said the spirit of truth, he the spirit
[1:04:00] of truth is to come. He will guide you
[1:04:03] into all truth. He shall not speak of
[1:04:07] himself
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; over and over again. The right spirit
[1:04:12] never speaks of the individual.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:17] [snorts]
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And I'll go back. I'm I'm going kind of
[1:04:20] be repetitive. Holy. How do you know
[1:04:23] you're in the right worship service?
[1:04:25] The worshipper is not leading you to his
[1:04:28] own glory.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's leading you to something
[1:04:31] greater.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A real worshiper, you won't
[1:04:34] see him. Hallelujah. All or him or her.
[1:04:37] Although you will enjoy the gift, but
[1:04:39] the gift brings you back to who? The
[1:04:41] giftgiver.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah. I love to see somebody that
[1:04:47] can really sing. Hallelujah. But under
[1:04:50] that anointing, under the right spirit,
[1:04:52] it makes me to crave more of him.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see sometimes you can see
[1:04:59] people Hallelujah uh that can really
[1:05:02] really I mean really anointed really got
[1:05:04] a powerful voice but you get nothing out
[1:05:06] of it.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Why the spirit behind it.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz the spirit is exalting them.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me church?
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now God is a spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] And for us to to to get anything out of
[1:05:26] him, we must tap into that same
[1:05:29] self-same spirit.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says if that
[1:05:34] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:05:36] dead
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; does what? Dwell in you. Oh, so it's
[1:05:41] possible.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It's possible for us to have the same
[1:05:44] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:05:46] dead.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So church shouldn't be a maybe or if if
[1:05:54] God was here or maybe God understand. No
[1:05:57] church, we have access access to the
[1:06:00] self same spirit.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That created the [screaming]
[1:06:05] world.
[1:06:08] [cheering]
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; amen. It's too often
[1:06:14] we just, you know, we look at the spirit
[1:06:17] as just a a a good worship service.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; No, the spirit is a person.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And that person is here right now.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And look what I love about
[1:06:32] it, church, what God has done,
[1:06:36] he's allowed us to have interaction
[1:06:39] with his selfsame being.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; It's not something different.
[1:06:44] Hallelujah. Now, I'm going to get into a
[1:06:46] little bit of of things that are more
[1:06:48] direct cuz right now I'm talking about
[1:06:50] the spirit. And you can say anything is
[1:06:52] the spirit, but we going to make it
[1:06:54] direct. Hallelujah. Look, we crave
[1:06:59] the same. Look. Oh my. That one just
[1:07:02] came. Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Church.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; This spirit I'm talking about is the
[1:07:06] same spirit. [screaming]
[1:07:07] Hallelujah.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; That walked up on 12 legions of demons.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And those demons recognized
[1:07:15] the spirit that was [screaming] behind
[1:07:17] that little frail body.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They weren't worried about
[1:07:22] Hallelujah. how big the body was, how
[1:07:24] strong it was, how masculine. They saw a
[1:07:27] spirit behind it
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Hey, we know who thou
[1:07:31] are." [laughter]
[1:07:33] So it don't matter your makeup.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what house you come out
[1:07:37] of. If you got the spirit of God in you,
[1:07:40] it'll do the same thing he did.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Demons saw that spirit and they feared
[1:07:49] and trembled.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we have access to.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. legions of demons. They were
[1:07:57] tormenting everybody. But when they saw
[1:08:00] Christ,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; not his flesh,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; his spirit.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; When they saw his spirit, the Bible
[1:08:09] says, hallelujah, that they were afraid.
[1:08:11] Hallelujah. Demons that tormented
[1:08:14] everybody. When they saw Christ, they
[1:08:16] ran up on him. They thought it was just
[1:08:18] anybody else. But as they got closer,
[1:08:20] hallelujah,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; they look past that flesh. The Bible
[1:08:24] says 12 legions of demons fell down and
[1:08:28] worshiped.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, [screaming]
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; The devil is powerless
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; in your life
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; if you got the right spirit. Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; The right spirit will make demons that
[1:08:48] have been victorious in other lives fall
[1:08:51] down and worship your God.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Church, I was in Quebec about three
[1:08:59] weeks ago and I was I was doing an
[1:09:01] outreach with a with a with a friend of
[1:09:03] mine and it was all kind of people that
[1:09:05] came and different things and and you
[1:09:07] know, we just preached the gospel. I
[1:09:10] ain't knew nobody. He ain't knew some
[1:09:11] people. We just preach the gospel.
[1:09:13] Hallelujah. And there's a spirit that's
[1:09:16] behind the word.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have to do anything
[1:09:21] special.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; If they receive the right spirit, that
[1:09:25] spirit will deliver.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That Hallelujah. If you receive the
[1:09:29] right spirit, that spirit will heal your
[1:09:32] body.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That spirit will give you a peace of
[1:09:34] mind. That spirit will go out and get
[1:09:36] your lost loved ones. You don't have to
[1:09:38] do nothing. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:09:40] But project the right thing.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what I love about this
[1:09:45] spirit, it don't need no help.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; But church, we was preaching and I told
[1:09:56] my testimony this time extensively
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; cuz uh uh uh uh it was different people
[1:10:02] there and they never heard it before. So
[1:10:04] I was telling my testimony extensively
[1:10:06] just preaching and different things and
[1:10:08] showing how God is a healer. And
[1:10:10] although I didn't know nothing about
[1:10:11] him, I received it by faith.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that spirit came into my
[1:10:17] life. Hallelujah.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; But now, hallelujah. That spirit was
[1:10:20] going to show me that he's truth.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz all I had, Hallelujah. Through the
[1:10:28] grace of God, my mom introducing me into
[1:10:30] the word. Hallelujah. She gave me a
[1:10:33] scripture Isaiah 53 that says God is a
[1:10:36] healer.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the spirit and the word
[1:10:42] run together.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's how you get spirit and truth.
[1:10:47] Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Because we know the Bible says in John
[1:10:51] 17 that you are sanctified through his
[1:10:53] word, thy word is truth.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:59] So tonight, hallelujah, we believe that
[1:11:02] we have God's word.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We believe, [screaming]
[1:11:06] hallelujah, that we have the truth of
[1:11:08] God's word
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; more than just a Baptist, more than just
[1:11:12] a Methodist or a Catholic or whatever
[1:11:14] else denomination we may have came out
[1:11:16] of. That was just in part. We believe
[1:11:18] that we have the full revelation of God,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; which is truth.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; No, we ain't going to let that one slide
[1:11:26] by.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You might not understand it, but I'm I'm
[1:11:34] I'm going to help pull you along
[1:11:35] tonight.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; What we have tonight was been revealed,
[1:11:40] hallelujah, through the corridors of the
[1:11:42] ages. We don't have something that's
[1:11:45] partial. We have the full revelation of
[1:11:48] God.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; We don't have a partial spirit. We have
[1:11:53] the fullness of God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; So, we have truth. Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So, we have the word, we have truth. The
[1:12:02] Bible says, "Ye shall know the truth,
[1:12:04] and the truth will make you free."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Church, before I started reading my
[1:12:13] Bible, I was I was quoting that wrong.
[1:12:18] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] Before I started reading my Bible, I was
[1:12:22] quoting that wrong because I would say,
[1:12:24] "You should know the truth." And the
[1:12:26] truth will set you free.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the truth will do what?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Make you free.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; So if you're hearing the word,
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. You can't stop it.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; If you're hearing the word, receiving
[1:12:42] that spirit, [screaming] Hallelujah. It
[1:12:44] says it will make you free
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; against your own will
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. No
[1:12:54] matter [screaming] how hard the enemy
[1:12:55] might fight, if you got truth, if you
[1:12:58] got the spirit, hallelujah, you will be
[1:13:01] made free.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; The devil can't stop it. He can't resist
[1:13:06] it. There's nothing that he can
[1:13:07] [screaming] do about it. The word has
[1:13:10] come to set us, make us free.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; If we receive the spirit
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; and we got the word.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:26] We're free.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; We're free.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we don't we may save
[1:13:35] this for tomorrow cuz I can kind of feel
[1:13:37] you pulling real good.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah. And church
[1:13:43] should be the freest place we could be
[1:13:47] [cheering and applause]
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; on our jobs and different things in the
[1:13:51] public. You know, everybody believes
[1:13:53] something different.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; There are a lot other spirits out there.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; But when we come here
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; under the same umbrella of the word
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; with the same spirit, the same word, the
[1:14:05] same truth. Hallelujah. We should be
[1:14:07] free as a bird.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; That's our right. The word makes us
[1:14:16] free. Every time we hear the word
[1:14:18] preach, hallelujah, it's to take you up
[1:14:20] into another climax.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; But what do we do? We sit down on our
[1:14:28] freedom
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; because some of us don't believe we're
[1:14:31] free.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; but you give me somebody that was once a
[1:14:36] slave.
[1:14:38] [snorts]
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about the natural. I'm
[1:14:44] talking about in the spirit.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I was once housing the wrong
[1:14:47] spirit. I was once doing the wrong
[1:14:50] things. I once had the wrong nature. I
[1:14:52] once talked the wrong talk, walk the
[1:14:54] wrong walk. But then I got the right
[1:14:56] [screaming] spirit.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got the right spirit.
[1:14:59] Hallelujah. And the word came my way and
[1:15:02] set me free. And you don't want me to
[1:15:04] shout about it. Hey,
[1:15:12] [applause]
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I'm at a place now I don't care about
[1:15:16] anybody else's judgment.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I refuse to go back in bondage.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a caged up eagle. An
[1:15:26] eagle was meant to saw.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a caged up lion. A life
[1:15:34] was [screaming] meant to roar.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Are you really free?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; The right spirit dictates freedom.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You ever seen somebody free and they
[1:15:56] sad?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; They don't quite understand.
[1:16:01] I can walk down the streets of the
[1:16:04] downtown Calgary. Hallelujah. Minding my
[1:16:08] own business with a smile on my face.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Snowing.
[1:16:14] As long as I'm wrapped up good, I got a
[1:16:16] reason to smile.
[1:16:18] Hallelu. Hallelujah. Glory. But what we
[1:16:22] do, we let the effects of life
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; dictate our freedom.
[1:16:28] When the Bible says, "Whom the Lord has
[1:16:31] set free
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; is free indeed."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That mean no matter what it looks like,
[1:16:37] I'm free.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; No matter what my bills look like, I'm
[1:16:41] free. No [screaming] matter what's going
[1:16:42] on at home, I'm free. No matter what the
[1:16:45] boss man say, I'm free. And they can't
[1:16:47] take your freedom [screaming]
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; because God has set me free.
[1:16:53] [cheering]
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:16:56] Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Look, I heard my brother just say, my
[1:17:04] little king say, "Free at last."
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Free at last. Who was he thanking?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God Almighty. I'm free at last.
[1:17:12] [screaming]
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; God is the only one that can set us
[1:17:14] free.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Not politicians, not politics, not money
[1:17:19] in the bank. The only one that can
[1:17:21] really set you free is God [screaming]
[1:17:23] Almighty.
[1:17:26] And until God does it, you don't even
[1:17:28] know what real freedom is.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And he didn't know what real freedom
[1:17:38] was.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Because he was basing his freedom upon
[1:17:42] political politics.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; But real freedom is when Christ comes in
[1:17:47] your heart.
[1:17:49] [screaming]
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:54] And you can love past a skin color.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You can love past a dialect.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; You can love past a country.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And you can look at somebody and see
[1:18:05] they got the same spirit you got.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; That's real freedom.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:16] [snorts]
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Spirit
[1:18:19] and truth.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; But I love it, church. Look at what he
[1:18:23] says. He says that, "Oh my, how do we
[1:18:29] maintain real liberty?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; How do we maintain real freedom?"
[1:18:35] It's a question, isn't it?
[1:18:38] Politics? No.
[1:18:42] A new president?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Nope. In y'all case, prime minister,
[1:18:48] no more Trudeau.
[1:18:51] Some of you like, "Oh, praise God."
[1:18:54] The next one going to do what they
[1:18:56] supposed to do
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; because God is in control.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't get all your stock.
[1:19:01] Don't put all your stock in the next
[1:19:02] person elected. Hallelujah. So things
[1:19:05] can be better down here. It ain't going
[1:19:07] to get no better.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; I keep telling the young folks over and
[1:19:10] over again, don't set yourself up,
[1:19:12] hallelujah, to live forever down here.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Set yourself up to live eternity
[1:19:18] someplace else. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. While I'm here, and I'm
[1:19:23] going to shock you. Yes. While I'm here,
[1:19:26] I want the best car. I want the biggest
[1:19:29] house. And I want plenty of money in the
[1:19:31] bank.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] [laughter]
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. I want to live good.
[1:19:42] Yes, I do. I'd be lying to you if I said
[1:19:44] I want to live in poverty.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's that false humility.
[1:19:50] That's right. [snorts]
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus didn't have no place to lay
[1:19:53] his head. But I ain't Jesus. [laughter]
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Solomon did.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David did. Yes, sir.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham did.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of God's people were
[1:20:09] blessed on this earth. Why? Because of
[1:20:12] the right spirit.
[1:20:16] [screaming]
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. King Solomon's God said,
[1:20:19] "What what do you want from me?" He
[1:20:21] said, "Lord, give me a spirit of
[1:20:23] wisdom."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Because you ask for the
[1:20:26] right thing, I'mma bless you in every
[1:20:28] other area."
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; So if you get the right spirit, God will
[1:20:32] take care of everything else.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; What we do first, we run after
[1:20:37] everything else,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; When we should make our life right
[1:20:40] first.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want the nicest car. I want the
[1:20:48] biggest house. I want plenty of money in
[1:20:50] my bank. But I want Christ more.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; So if I never obtain any of those
[1:20:56] things, hallelujah, I'm going to still
[1:20:58] give God all my heart.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve it with everything I
[1:21:01] got.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to let the
[1:21:03] times of life walk me down and put me
[1:21:06] back in the world.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; If I don't get it, maybe it meant that I
[1:21:12] don't I ain't supposed to have it. And
[1:21:14] I'm fine with that. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; But until he tells me no, I'mma keep
[1:21:18] looking for that Maserati.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:21:27] I'm going to get back to the testimony.
[1:21:28] If I if I if I if I keep going, somebody
[1:21:31] shout out testimony. Church, before I
[1:21:34] came to service, I was praying
[1:21:37] and just over my own life, God started
[1:21:40] to bring it together like the things I'm
[1:21:43] praying about. And then it was like God
[1:21:45] was talking to me say, "You've been
[1:21:48] preaching about all this stuff you
[1:21:50] believe God going to do. When you going
[1:21:52] to start walking into it?"
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I see. I put God way out there. I put
[1:22:03] him way out there. I don't believe in
[1:22:04] just a a a God like I believe in a big
[1:22:07] God.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He's always on my
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; side.
[1:22:14] Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I serve a mighty big God.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I don't put them down here. I put them
[1:22:26] way up there. H I throw them way out
[1:22:28] there.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been I've been I've
[1:22:31] been confessing. Hallelujah. In my
[1:22:33] prayers and out loud over churches all
[1:22:35] over the world. I've been saying I
[1:22:37] believe God can bless me with a house
[1:22:38] that's already paid for.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] Get too many amens on that one.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Well, you keep paying a mortgage.
[1:22:50] [laughter]
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; My Bible said you going to stay in
[1:22:54] houses you didn't even build.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'mma eat in vineyards I
[1:22:59] didn't even plant. Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I'm sick of going to the Whole Food
[1:23:03] store.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; I want my own stuff.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in a God like
[1:23:12] that, church.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; But where is it coming from? Hallelujah.
[1:23:15] The Bible says, hallelujah, that he
[1:23:18] could do exceedingly abundantly above.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church, exceedingly
[1:23:24] abundantly above.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; All that you could ask
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; or think. So if I can think it, that
[1:23:33] means God can do more than that.
[1:23:38] So, a house [screaming] without a
[1:23:39] mortgage ain't nothing.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Because I thought about it
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know how God talked to
[1:23:50] you, but that's how he talked to me.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; He was like, "Hey, you've been
[1:23:54] professing, saying all this stuff. It
[1:23:56] ain't just good preaching. It's time for
[1:23:58] you to walk into it." Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; So, I believe somewhere out there,
[1:24:03] either somebody's building a house for
[1:24:05] me
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; or it's already out there they going to
[1:24:07] give to.
[1:24:10] [laughter]
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:16] [screaming]
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; See, some of y'all listen to that. You
[1:24:19] better you getting high. You believe
[1:24:20] what you want to believe.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Just the same God
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; that can heal my body from cancer with
[1:24:26] no bill.
[1:24:31] is the same God that can provide a house
[1:24:35] for this body he heal to stay in with no
[1:24:37] bill.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know how things work over here,
[1:24:47] but you know the Lord was sharing with
[1:24:49] me. He was like, "Hey, see you waiting
[1:24:51] to credit get right and all this stuff."
[1:24:53] He said, "That ain't faith.
[1:24:57] you mapping it out. You trying to get it
[1:24:59] together. He said, "Step out to the
[1:25:01] impossible."
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; The credit might not look right to them,
[1:25:07] but if you got the right spirit,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; oh my, the Bible also says he'll take
[1:25:16] from the healing and give to the
[1:25:17] believer.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. That brother said,
[1:25:21] "That's me." [snorts]
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. See church, when we hear these
[1:25:25] kind of things, what does it do? It
[1:25:27] should challenge you to believe for
[1:25:29] greater things.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Even in business and different things,
[1:25:35] some of us got businesses. You ought to
[1:25:37] be saying, "Lord, I'm tired of running
[1:25:38] this.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of running this business.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Give me some. Put me in a place where
[1:25:43] somebody else can run it and I can just
[1:25:45] be with my family."
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz all I want to do is serve you.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want my business to make me miss
[1:25:56] church or any other opportunity to be a
[1:25:58] blessing for God.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I've tried it. I've tried business and
[1:26:07] all these things and God wouldn't let me
[1:26:08] prosper. You know why? Because it took
[1:26:10] away from who and what he wanted me to
[1:26:13] do in the kingdom.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And that's just me. That's my own
[1:26:17] personal testimony.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah. I believe that
[1:26:21] God can do anything.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I said I said it in Australia.
[1:26:26] Hallelujah.
[1:26:28] Somebody must need this. Hallelujah. I
[1:26:29] was Australia about two weeks ago and I
[1:26:31] said I said hey you know what I said we
[1:26:33] we talking about brother Brandon not
[1:26:35] pulling for money and I know if I say
[1:26:36] right now pull out a basket I need an
[1:26:38] offering.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Y'all look at me like crazy. Better yet
[1:26:41] you'll look at him like what in the
[1:26:43] world is this brother doing? Brother
[1:26:45] Brandon never pull for money. Let's make
[1:26:47] sense out of it. Hallelujah. He didn't
[1:26:49] have to
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; because God hallelujah anointed and
[1:26:53] inspired 20 millionaires to take care of
[1:26:56] him.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; In your books is called the Christian
[1:27:04] businessman.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; H remember he said, "Hey, they bought me
[1:27:08] a house in a gated community. I can't
[1:27:10] stay in there." Who you think was doing
[1:27:12] it?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; They bought me a big old Cadillac. I
[1:27:15] can't drive a car like that. And then he
[1:27:17] say, "Hey, my clothes are bought for
[1:27:19] me." Who you think was doing it?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; People that God made rich to take care
[1:27:24] of his servant.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And then, hallelujah. I stepped way on
[1:27:30] out there. I said, "God, if you gave a
[1:27:32] prophet 20, all I need is one
[1:27:34] millionaire." [laughter]
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Brother D, you
[1:27:41] being conn." No. This is what I believe.
[1:27:43] I believe that God [screaming] is a God
[1:27:45] that says he's never seen the righteous
[1:27:48] forsaken or his seed begging for bread.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; We not beggars, we believers.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the song.
[1:27:59] Hallelujah. You made a way. He made a
[1:28:02] way.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was over. that
[1:28:08] song where the author Travis Green, he
[1:28:11] from my state
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; and you know his wife, him and his wife
[1:28:16] was having she was pregnant with their
[1:28:18] first child and she her water broke I
[1:28:22] think at 21 weeks.
[1:28:25] 21 weeks they had to take the baby out.
[1:28:27] Something like that. It was real real
[1:28:29] super early. 21 weeks they had to take
[1:28:31] the baby out and the doctor comes to him
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; and his wife and say, "Well, we got to
[1:28:37] take the baby. You know, most likely
[1:28:40] ain't going to live, but y'all can try
[1:28:42] again."
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And we be wondering where songs come
[1:28:46] from.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; We Oh my.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; See, y'all pulled me into tomorrow.
[1:28:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We be wondering
[1:28:53] where these inspirations come from. He
[1:28:56] said when the doctor told him that, he
[1:28:58] said he looked at his wife and he said,
[1:29:00] "We trust [screaming] God too much to
[1:29:02] give up now."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here against the
[1:29:09] circumstances, no matter what's going
[1:29:10] on, can say tonight that the spirit in
[1:29:13] me, it trustes God too much to give up
[1:29:16] now?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And that baby that was 21 weeks is now
[1:29:22] living and singing songs with his
[1:29:24] father.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:29] [screaming]
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And that's somebody who don't know the
[1:29:34] truth like me and you know
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; and we got a full revelation of God. We
[1:29:39] should see just as much or even greater
[1:29:42] miracles in our own lives.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; God honors faith. [snorts]
[1:29:51] Hallelujah.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. and say when it looked like it was
[1:29:55] over,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; he said, "Hey, you move mountains.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; You cause walls to fall with your
[1:30:05] power."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You do what?
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; You perform miracles.
[1:30:14] There is nothing
[1:30:17] [screaming]
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; that God can't do.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And I'm standing here today only
[1:30:25] because you made a way.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; See, that's what the right spirit will
[1:30:33] do.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But what if you got spirit and truth?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; He told the prophet, if you could get
[1:30:43] the people to believe, nothing will be
[1:30:46] able to stand before you.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had the right spirit and
[1:30:49] he had truth. So he said nothing will be
[1:30:51] able to stand in front of you, not even
[1:30:53] cancer.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I feel the Holy Spirit present
[1:30:59] tonight.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, so we're free. Why? Because we
[1:31:06] got the word.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; The word makes us free. Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; But on and on. Listen, don't get
[1:31:13] nervous. I ain't going to be too much
[1:31:14] longer. I'm about to close. Listen
[1:31:19] now.
[1:31:20] What is that spirit for us? Hallelujah.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; That spirit for us is really simple.
[1:31:28] It's called something
[1:31:30] that I'm sure you hear about a lot in
[1:31:32] this church.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; It's called the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; He's my friend, so I know what you like
[1:31:41] to talk about.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] Don't never get too spiritual
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; to hear about the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me show you why.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit is that spirit
[1:31:59] we're talking about.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's the comforter.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's he that's going to guide you into
[1:32:05] all truth.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That's he that's going to show you
[1:32:08] things to come. Hallelujah. And if you
[1:32:10] don't want to hear about the Holy Ghost,
[1:32:12] you you can't conquer your future. Amen.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You can't be led, you can't be guided
[1:32:17] into all truth without the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is so important.
[1:32:23] Hallelujah. But but let's look at what
[1:32:27] what does the Holy Ghost mean to you and
[1:32:28] I.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] It's very important
[1:32:34] that we receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost is Christ
[1:32:39] himself.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] W the Holy Ghost is he. Hallelujah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a person.

[1:32:49] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is someone
[1:32:52] living in you.

[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; someone praying through you.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Someone Hallelujah. ordering your steps.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not some mystical
[1:33:03] thought. The Holy Ghost is a person.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm feel I'm going to say this real
[1:33:13] boldly.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I got the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That mean I

[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; If you got the Holy Ghost, you got
[1:33:29] Christ in you.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Hallelujah. The one
[1:33:33] that was in the lion's den. The one that
[1:33:35] was in the fiery furnace. The one that
[1:33:37] split the red she. The one that
[1:33:40] instructed him to build a boat that'll
[1:33:42] go through destruction. Hallelujah. The
[1:33:45] one Hallelujah. that overshadowed Mary.
[1:33:48] Hallelujah.
[1:33:51] [cheering]
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That came four days late
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; just to show what that spirit will do.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Realize that, church. Sometimes God
[1:34:05] comes late just to show how powerful
[1:34:08] what you have inside.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; My mom sing a song. He's an on time God.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh

[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Oh yes he is. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; May not come when you want it, but he'll
[1:34:32] be there right all time
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; cuz he's an old time God.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; that spirit living in you tonight, it'll
[1:34:46] do the same thing it did in Jesus.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because [screaming] it is Jesus.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] See what denominations do? They make
[1:35:00] that spirit three.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; When there's only one
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; God the Father, the Son, and the Holy
[1:35:07] Spirit is one person.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Living in you. Hallelujah.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:16] Cuz we know how the prophet broke it
[1:35:18] down. See, that's that's what I'm
[1:35:19] saying. Truth. Hallelujah. We know the
[1:35:22] father is a title.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is a title.
[1:35:27] Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; But all of that living in one person.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And we have that person. Hallelujah.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody asked me one time, they say,
[1:35:36] "Hey, well, if you saying it's one
[1:35:38] person, well, what color is God?"
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; "What color is God?" He was trying to be
[1:35:44] sarcastic.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; "What color is God?" I said, "Well, if
[1:35:48] he and me, he a black man. He and you.
[1:35:51] He's a white man. Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; See, it ain't it ain't the flesh. It's
[1:35:55] the spirit behind the flesh.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; I ain't never seen a colorful spirit.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit is a life.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I've seen Filipino Holy Ghost.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I've seen Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] Oh,
[1:36:24] I've seen South African Hallelujah. Holy
[1:36:26] Ghost.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Speaking a whole another language.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; What is it? It has nothing to do with
[1:36:33] the flesh. It's the spirit.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, how important is it to have the
[1:36:43] right spirit?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Listen,
[1:36:46] for those of you who don't have the Holy
[1:36:48] Ghost, you're defeating the purpose of
[1:36:50] living here.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Calvary. I'm
[1:36:54] talking about on the earth.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; You're defeating the purpose. Think
[1:36:57] about it. Hallelujah. Wouldn't you
[1:36:59] wouldn't you want to be a person that's
[1:37:01] housing the almighty God?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] [snorts]
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; I I I don't think we catching that one,
[1:37:12] church. Those of you who have the Holy
[1:37:14] Ghost, the prophet of God said,
[1:37:15] hallelujah, if you got the Holy Ghost,
[1:37:18] he said, the same power that created the
[1:37:20] world is living in you.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Just the right spirit can do that.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Joshua looking at the sun say, "Hey,
[1:37:31] son, stand still. Moon, you hang over
[1:37:33] here." And he didn't even have the Holy
[1:37:35] Ghost. Right.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have the person.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He just had a right spirit.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Bible says, hallelujah, that Daniel was
[1:37:47] of an excellent spirit.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the person, the life of
[1:37:52] Christ inside. They just had a good
[1:37:54] spirit.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Now, what should we be able to do?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Or what should I say? What should we be
[1:38:03] able to believe for?
[1:38:09] The Holy Ghost. How important is it?
[1:38:12] Listen.
[1:38:13] Hallelujah. I love how the prophet put
[1:38:15] this. He said, "The Holy Spirit is your
[1:38:18] earnest."
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know brother Paul hope you mind.
[1:38:26] I know he's a builder. Hallelujah. And
[1:38:28] and and and if I'm correct, you don't
[1:38:31] just go build a house. They got to give
[1:38:33] you a little something. They got to put
[1:38:35] a little something down. Got to give you
[1:38:36] a little earnest to show that you're
[1:38:38] serious about it. Honey, you like, "Hey,
[1:38:40] hey, man. I want you to go build me a
[1:38:42] million dollar house and I'll come back
[1:38:44] with the money." No. No. It don't work
[1:38:46] like that. You got to have a down
[1:38:48] payment.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; I got to know that you serious.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost, Hallelujah.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Shows the rims, hallelujah, of the
[1:39:00] world. Hallelujah. How serious you are.
[1:39:02] Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; It's the earnest. It's the down payment.
[1:39:07] Hallelujah. Of the whole deal.
[1:39:09] Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; As long as I've given a down payment,
[1:39:12] you got to give me what I want.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Or give me my down payment back.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I sure don't want my life back.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I'm going on with the
[1:39:22] deal. Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen what the prophet says. Oh
[1:39:27] my. Everybody all right?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "We don't have it now
[1:39:33] in full. We have the earnest of our
[1:39:35] salvation. We have the earnest of
[1:39:38] eternal. We got the earnest of eternal
[1:39:40] life."
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Think about that, church.
[1:39:45] We sing that song uh uh uh we shall
[1:39:50] rise.
[1:39:51] Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; In the resurrection morning.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; When death's prison bonds are broken,
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; we shall rise. Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is the earnest of
[1:40:03] that.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And you you know what we should say? I
[1:40:06] shall rise.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; I will rise.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Listen. He says the earnest of your
[1:40:12] salvation. We have the earnest of
[1:40:14] eternal life of an immortal life. The
[1:40:18] Holy Ghost says that we don't belong
[1:40:22] here.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost says that you have
[1:40:29] residency someplace else.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my immortal life that will live
[1:40:36] forever as we receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:40:39] We also have the earnest of our
[1:40:41] resurrection. Oh my.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; So if I got the Holy Ghost, that mean if
[1:40:46] I die, I'mma automatically raise up.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:52] That's the power of the right spirit.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:40:56] comforter himself in you. He said, as we
[1:40:58] see a frail body, nothing but a shadow
[1:41:02] laying eat up with cancer where
[1:41:05] Hallelujah. where many fine doctors has
[1:41:07] tried to kill or or fail. Hallelujah. To
[1:41:10] see God Almighty heal that person.
[1:41:13] That's the proof of the resurrection.
[1:41:15] Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Now, you guys, Hallelujah, may not even
[1:41:20] realize the power of what I'm just
[1:41:21] reading to you.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He said that the proof of the
[1:41:25] resurrection is a body that's maybe been
[1:41:27] eat up by cancer and doctors didn't try
[1:41:30] to do everything they can do to heal it
[1:41:32] and God supernaturally heals that
[1:41:33] person.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; He said that's the proof of the
[1:41:36] resurrection right in your face.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen on that one? Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts] I just said that that was
[1:41:45] the proof.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, come here what 12, 13, 14, 15
[1:41:50] years.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the enemy tried to
[1:41:53] kill this body with cancer,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; make it look all frail, make it look all
[1:41:58] sick, and God's word came and healed it.
[1:42:01] So, you know what I am? I am to you the
[1:42:04] proof of the resurrection.
[1:42:07] [applause]
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; I don't get the glory. He does.
[1:42:11] See, he's the one that healed my body.
[1:42:13] He's the one that show See what he said.
[1:42:15] He will show you things to come. He
[1:42:17] won't speak of himself. He'll speak of
[1:42:19] Oh my.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It'll speak of him, Christ.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; That's what the right spirit does.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It brings us back to truth. Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] And we when you got the Holy Ghost, you
[1:42:33] got the earnest [screaming] Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] of a body change.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; You got the Holy Ghost. If you drop dead
[1:42:39] right now, you got the earnest
[1:42:41] [screaming] of eternal life.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Because of spirit and truth.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:42:50] Oh my. Think about it. Look at what God
[1:42:53] did.
[1:42:55] Oh my. Listen.
[1:42:57] When we bring all us together, the
[1:42:59] spirit and the word, he says, "But God
[1:43:02] knows what he's doing as long as he has
[1:43:05] as long as he's leading." You see, you
[1:43:08] must always go by the spirit. And the
[1:43:11] spirit will always agree with the word.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; That's how you know somebody ain't got
[1:43:18] the right spirit.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; If they don't agree with the word,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said this. Brother
[1:43:26] Brandham said that he he made mistakes
[1:43:28] here. He made mistakes that. But what
[1:43:30] does the word say?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; See, I'm to a place now
[1:43:37] where I'm not looking for debates.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; On the message.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to debate somebody what
[1:43:44] I believe.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going just live it.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going show you what this message
[1:43:48] will do.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going show you what it means,
[1:43:51] hallelujah, to be born again.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; I'mma show you what it means to house
[1:43:55] the power of God inside of you.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And that has nothing to do with brother
[1:44:00] Brad. Hallelujah. Because he Hallelujah
[1:44:04] came to do what? Turn [screaming] our
[1:44:05] hearts back to what? The faith.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Turn our hearts back to Christ.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And in doing all that, he said, "This
[1:44:14] message made my Bible what?" A
[1:44:15] [screaming] new book.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Brought us back into what? Truth.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. We are blessed people.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; This is not just a Saturday night. This
[1:44:29] is a reunion of truth.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; We got the right spirit with the truth.
[1:44:38] That mean anything is possible today.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now if the spirit leads
[1:44:45] you contrary to the word, then it's not
[1:44:47] the spirit of God." Now, if the Holy
[1:44:49] Spirit is leading you, hallelujah, it'll
[1:44:51] say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:44:54] today, and forever.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's God in you, that mean that
[1:44:59] anything you read in this Bible, he can
[1:45:01] still do it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And even what's not written.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that take people for a loop
[1:45:13] because they be looking for something
[1:45:15] the prophet said or they be trying to
[1:45:17] find it in the script. The Bible says,
[1:45:19] "Hallelujah. If everything that Christ
[1:45:21] did was written, the books wouldn't be
[1:45:22] able to contain it." Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; So, there are some things that we can
[1:45:25] believe for that's not on paper.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You might not be able to find it in the
[1:45:33] message of the hour,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; but God is God.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Look, like I was saying, I was
[1:45:40] preaching. I tell my testimony and and
[1:45:43] uh uh I was talking about God healed me
[1:45:46] and at the end, hallelujah, I say, I can
[1:45:49] feel the spirit of the Lord moving.
[1:45:51] if you want prayer, come to the front.
[1:45:54] So, everybody came to the front
[1:45:55] expecting a traditional prayer line.
[1:45:56] Y'all, but y'all know I'm not
[1:45:58] traditional.
[1:46:00] So, it was just kind of shocking because
[1:46:02] new people and all these things and
[1:46:04] different ones. Hallelujah. I said, I
[1:46:06] want everybody to stand in a circle. So,
[1:46:08] we all stood in a circle. I said, "Let's
[1:46:10] hold hands." And I'm not just going to
[1:46:12] pray, but I want you to pray.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I want you to express to God what you
[1:46:18] want him to do in your life. Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro Digs, why you doing that?"
[1:46:22] Because when I'm gone, you still got to
[1:46:23] have a relationship with God.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; When I'm gone, Hallelujah. You still may
[1:46:29] need things from God. You can't wait
[1:46:31] till next winter.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; For me to come back.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all caught that one.
[1:46:42] [snorts]
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; But when it's something personal,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; When you know that he lives in you.
[1:46:47] Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Ask and it
[1:46:50] shall be given."
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seek. Hallelujah. And ye
[1:46:54] shall find. Knock and the door shall be
[1:46:56] open to you. He said, "For he who
[1:46:59] askketh does what? Receive."
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; That's truth. Hallelujah. So, everybody
[1:47:08] will stand up front. I said, I want
[1:47:10] everybody to pray to God and pray what
[1:47:13] you want the Lord to do for you because
[1:47:15] he's here. Amen.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; So they prayed, I prayed, all of us
[1:47:18] prayed up front, you know, it was just a
[1:47:21] powerful atmosphere.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere it is when everybody
[1:47:25] is praying.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just the person leading
[1:47:30] the service, but everybody knows their
[1:47:32] God.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful atmosphere.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; It was a it was a it was a uh I got a
[1:47:38] testimony back from a uh from the
[1:47:41] parents of a young girl. Her name is
[1:47:43] Judith.
[1:47:45] And Judith was diagnosed with ADHD when
[1:47:48] she was 5 years old.
[1:47:50] And in the in the uh caption of the
[1:47:53] letter, they say that's some 13 plus
[1:47:55] years ago, something like that. And they
[1:47:57] said, "Well, you could always tell when
[1:47:59] she didn't have her medicine. You sent
[1:48:01] her to school and because she didn't
[1:48:03] have the medicine, she get in a lot of
[1:48:05] trouble because she's not focused." All
[1:48:07] these different things that they say the
[1:48:09] effects of ADHD.
[1:48:11] So that was a diagnosed from the doctor.
[1:48:13] But you know, uh, she would get into all
[1:48:16] kind of trouble, all kind of things, and
[1:48:17] they call her parents and say, "Hey,
[1:48:19] Judith is acting up and say, did she
[1:48:21] have a medicine? Oh man, we must forgot
[1:48:22] or she didn't take it." Blah, blah,
[1:48:23] blah. So they get the medicine, too. She
[1:48:25] calm down. They say, "Okay, everything
[1:48:27] all right. She's got a medicine." But
[1:48:29] Judith in church that night,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; 13 or whatever she was, h, Judith got
[1:48:37] home and she told her mama and daddy,
[1:48:39] she said, "Hey, y'all know what? I ain't
[1:48:42] taking this medicine no more and she
[1:48:43] threw it in the trash.
[1:48:46] [applause]
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; 13 or teenager, whatever. Hallelujah.
[1:48:51] She threw it in the trash. And the mom
[1:48:53] and dad was like, "What? What? What?
[1:48:54] What are you doing?" She said, "If God
[1:48:57] can do that for brother Diggs, he can do
[1:48:59] that for me."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; What was she doing? She was tapping into
[1:49:03] the spirit. [applause]
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "Hallelujah." the
[1:49:08] words that they gave me the testimony
[1:49:10] saying that she was so inspired by your
[1:49:13] testimony. She said, "If God can do that
[1:49:15] for him, he can do that for me."
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; So, she didn't take a medicine, threw it
[1:49:19] in the trash and went to school like she
[1:49:21] normally do.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And you know, sometimes parents because
[1:49:24] we love our kids so much, we have more
[1:49:27] doubt than they do.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; They just believe in God, but we love
[1:49:30] them so much. We like, "Oh my, she
[1:49:32] didn't went to school without a
[1:49:33] medicine, this and that." So, they
[1:49:34] waiting on the phone call. No phone
[1:49:36] call.
[1:49:38] waiting a little bit longer. No phone
[1:49:40] call
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; cuz they almost I need to go back and
[1:49:44] read it, but I think they wanted to call
[1:49:45] the school.
[1:49:48] [snorts]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Want to make want to make the girl have
[1:49:50] a fit
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; when she belie
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; if somebody say they believe in God, you
[1:49:56] believe with him.
[1:49:59] [applause]
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Don't be like Saul. Saul had the wrong
[1:50:03] spirit. He told David, you just a you.
[1:50:06] He's been a He's been a a giant killer.
[1:50:08] He's been a warrior since his youth.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And David's standing there saying, "My
[1:50:12] God, my God, I got the right spirit."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; My God going to take care of it. If
[1:50:18] somebody's believing, let's just believe
[1:50:20] with them.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Church, I'm sure. Hallelujah.
[1:50:27] She went through that day with no
[1:50:30] spells, no acting out, no nothing. So I
[1:50:33] think the parents did talk to the nurse
[1:50:35] or whatever say how was Judith was fine.
[1:50:37] Judith ain't come to my office.
[1:50:40] What was it? She received the right
[1:50:42] spirit.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; The spirit of him. Hallelujah.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Glory. In the same service. Hallelujah.
[1:50:50] Hallelu. There's another sister who said
[1:50:51] she came to church and she said, "You
[1:50:53] ever came to church, you say, Lord, I
[1:50:55] need something directly to me.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I need something personal.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; I do that all the time.
[1:51:01] I said, "Lord, I need you to talk to me
[1:51:03] tonight." She said, as she was she was
[1:51:05] saying as she was sitting in service,
[1:51:06] she said, "Lord, I need the minister to
[1:51:08] talk to me tonight." She said, while she
[1:51:11] was praying that, I walked up to her,
[1:51:13] grabbed her by hand, and stood her up
[1:51:15] and say, "You are a miracle."
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; And then I said it again to her, "You
[1:51:19] are a miracle. You are a miracle." She
[1:51:21] said, I said it to her three times.
[1:51:23] Hallelujah. She said, hallelujah. She
[1:51:26] said she knew that was God because she
[1:51:28] had three sicknesses she was being
[1:51:30] challenged by and God healed of all
[1:51:32] three in that service. [applause]
[1:51:36] Hallelujah. It's word to word.
[1:51:39] Hallelujah. If I say anything that
[1:51:42] blesses you through the word, that means
[1:51:44] because you are the word.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] Church, I can go on and on about what
[1:51:55] happens when the room is full of his
[1:51:58] spirit.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Remember what the Bible says,
[1:52:00] hallelujah. When they all got on one
[1:52:02] accord,
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; one mind,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; what happened?
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; He, the spirit of truth, came down,
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Think about that next time you come to
[1:52:15] church.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; What if in your mind you just say,
[1:52:18] "Lord," in your heart you say, "Lord,
[1:52:20] have your way with me today." Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And you take the chains off. Sometimes
[1:52:24] the devil don't put chains on us. We do.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:52:39] I'm about to close.
[1:52:42] But church, when that right spirit comes
[1:52:44] in the congregation and we all believing
[1:52:47] under the umbrella of one mind, one
[1:52:49] accord, and God comes down,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; to seal us
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; under that faith,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; supernatural things become regular
[1:52:59] things.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; I heard a brother say one time they was
[1:53:05] having so many supernatural things
[1:53:07] happening in their church. He said,
[1:53:09] "We're not looking for cancer anymore.
[1:53:12] Cancel is nothing."
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're looking for people that
[1:53:14] are blind."
[1:53:17] [snorts]
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not just cancer, man.
[1:53:19] That ain't We're looking for people that
[1:53:21] are blind.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; We want to see God. We know God can open
[1:53:24] blinded eyes.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; How big is your God tonight?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; How big is that spirit in you? Can it
[1:53:32] believe for anything?
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, I just know
[1:53:39] that God has something great in store
[1:53:41] for us. I don't I don't have time to
[1:53:43] read it, but
[1:53:47] in you know what, if y'all don't mind,
[1:53:50] I'mma read this.
[1:53:52] In one quote, everything I preach to
[1:53:55] y'all is summed up in one quote.
[1:54:00] That's why I know this message is truth.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I didn't I didn't preach
[1:54:05] maybe well my I set my alarm for an hour
[1:54:09] a hour hallelujah of preaching by
[1:54:12] inspiration.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Now what I preach hallelujah catching
[1:54:16] your thoughts and watching catching the
[1:54:18] way of the spirit and move. That's my
[1:54:20] pattern. My pattern hallelujah is to
[1:54:22] touch and agree with the spirit that's
[1:54:24] in the room.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you that's why I say
[1:54:28] you pull I preach. Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; If you think Hallelujah. If you think in
[1:54:32] the right channel, Hallelujah. God allow
[1:54:35] my gift to catch it and talk to you.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; That's just the way I'm built.
[1:54:43] Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; But think about all the things I've said
[1:54:47] tonight. I'm going to read one quote and
[1:54:48] going to sum up the whole thing.
[1:54:51] This is what the prophet of God says. He
[1:54:53] says,
[1:54:55] "The word always comes to the truly
[1:54:58] spiritfilled."
[1:55:00] This is the evidence of being filled
[1:55:02] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Not a dance, not a shout. It's the
[1:55:09] spirit. Hallelujah. Coming to those that
[1:55:11] receive the word.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Holy Ghost is what? You
[1:55:18] living the word for your day.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's how we know you got the Holy
[1:55:23] Ghost. Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; If you can look at this word and don't
[1:55:27] deny any parts of it, but be like Mary,
[1:55:30] be unto me according to your word.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy [snorts] Ghost.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, the evidence of being filled
[1:55:42] with the Holy Ghost, that is what Jesus
[1:55:45] said would be the evidence. He said,
[1:55:47] "And I will pray the father and he will
[1:55:49] send you another comforter." Who is the
[1:55:52] comforter? The comforter is the Holy
[1:55:54] Ghost.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That he may abide with you
[1:56:02] forever. Even the spirit of truth whom
[1:56:06] the world cannot receive. The world
[1:56:08] can't receive what? The Holy Ghost.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth.
[1:56:16] Oh my.
[1:56:18] He said the world cannot receive. Now we
[1:56:21] know what the truth is.
[1:56:24] Thy word is truth. John 17:7. John
[1:56:28] 17:17. Again in John 8 and 43. Now these
[1:56:32] all the things I didn't talk about
[1:56:33] tonight. Hallelujah. John 8:43. Why do
[1:56:37] you not understand my speech? Even
[1:56:40] because ye hear ye cannot hear my word.
[1:56:44] Did you notice that Jesus said that the
[1:56:47] world could not receive the Holy Ghost?
[1:56:50] Well, in this verse I just read, neither
[1:56:53] could they receive the word.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; You'll never get the Holy Ghost unless
[1:56:59] you receive the word.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; And without the word, you cannot receive
[1:57:05] the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; That's for you people who don't come to
[1:57:10] church all the time.
[1:57:13] Well, I think I'mma stay home and stream
[1:57:15] tonight.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Don't miss out on the spirit.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Because they run together, spirit and
[1:57:22] truth.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong. I know sometimes you
[1:57:25] can't make it and all these things, but
[1:57:27] it just ain't the same watching it
[1:57:29] online.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; I like to be there.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; That's like Hallelujah. You watch the
[1:57:37] cooking channel and they cooking
[1:57:39] something really good.
[1:57:41] Boy, boy, that looks so good. Your mouth
[1:57:43] get watering.
[1:57:46] You can't taste it.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Smell it.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Look good. Everybody, you can't smell
[1:57:50] it. Can't All you can do is whoo
[1:57:54] unless you go in the kitchen and make it
[1:57:56] yourself.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; But you got to stick with the recipe.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against streaming,
[1:58:05] but if you can make it, why not be in
[1:58:08] that presence? Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Why not be Hallelujah with those of like
[1:58:12] precious faith?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, he says, uh,
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; neither could they receive the word.
[1:58:19] Why? Because the spirit and the word are
[1:58:22] one.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You heard me tonight. My title is what?
[1:58:26] Spirit and truth.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the word is one. You
[1:58:30] can't separate. You say, "Bro D, I got
[1:58:33] the word and not the right spirit."
[1:58:36] You said, "Brother D, I got I got the
[1:58:37] spirit and not the truth."
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; They work together.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit as the prophets, the word
[1:58:45] will come to come to you. You would
[1:58:47] receive it. John 14 and 26. But the
[1:58:49] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
[1:58:52] the father will send in my name, he
[1:58:54] shall teach you. See, I like the way he
[1:58:56] said. He shall teach you. The comforter,
[1:58:59] he shall teach you. The guide, he shall
[1:59:02] teach you.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:04] He shall teach you all things and bring
[1:59:06] all things to your remembrance. The Holy
[1:59:08] Ghost will bring up things that you may
[1:59:11] have forgotten.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's God keeping his own
[1:59:16] word.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. whatsoever I have said unto you.
[1:59:21] Here again we find we find that the word
[1:59:25] coming because the spirit of God again
[1:59:27] in John 16:13. How be it when he
[1:59:33] hallelujah when he the spirit of truth
[1:59:36] word is come he will guide you into all
[1:59:39] truth. Thy word [screaming] is truth
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; and he shall not speak of himself. Now
[1:59:44] let me ask you something tonight church.
[1:59:46] Have I given you the word?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Have I given you truth? You should say
[1:59:52] amen. Because not one time have I given
[1:59:54] you brother the digs thoughts.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; He will always speak of him.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; The right spirit will always speak of
[2:00:04] Christ.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; That's why me personally, I can receive
[2:00:09] the prophet as a prophet because he
[2:00:11] always pointed when I listen I hear him
[2:00:14] pointing me to Christ. Not the
[2:00:15] Jeffersonville, not the Arizona, not to
[2:00:18] all these different things, these
[2:00:19] different relics. Those are other people
[2:00:21] doing those things. But when I hear the
[2:00:23] spirit move on those tapes and books, I
[2:00:25] hear Christ.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Just like when I read Paul, Christ.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; When I read Thessalonians, Christ.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I read Ephesus, Christ.
[2:00:41] Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; It should always tell us about him.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; If you get up here and talk about your
[2:00:47] life all the time, that's not the right
[2:00:50] spirit.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; The testimonies I share is about what?
[2:00:54] Christ.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, 'I want you to note very
[2:01:01] carefully that Jesus did not say that
[2:01:04] the evidence of being baptized with the
[2:01:08] Holy Ghost while speaking in tongue,
[2:01:10] interpreting, prophesying, or shouting
[2:01:13] and dancing. He said the evidence would
[2:01:16] be that you would be in the truth.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; You would be in the word of God for your
[2:01:24] age. Evidence has to do with receiving
[2:01:28] the word.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; How many got the Holy Ghost?
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't receive that word and not
[2:01:41] have the right spirit.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm in a mess church." So is
[2:01:46] the devil.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; He does everything he can do to get in
[2:01:52] here and mess up the service.
[2:01:55] But there's but then there's another
[2:01:57] spirit.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Come musicians come.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Then there's another spirit.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; So we want spirit and truth.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's the truth by that spirit
[2:02:08] that sets makes us free.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank God for a word.
[2:02:13] Hallelujah.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; That'll always express the life of
[2:02:17] Christ. Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; If there's any word you hear that see
[2:02:21] see that's the problem we have with
[2:02:23] denominations. Hallelujah. Most of the
[2:02:25] pastors always bring the people to them.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; And most of the churches bring the
[2:02:31] people to them.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; You got to be at this church. You got to
[2:02:34] listen. This this is the only church and
[2:02:36] we the only ones got it. This we
[2:02:40] No,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; it's all about Christ.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I can
[2:02:46] witness to somebody and tell them about
[2:02:49] Christ without telling them about my
[2:02:52] church
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; or where I worship. That's between them
[2:02:57] and God.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; My job is to tell them the truth
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; with the right spirit.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God say, "Hey,
[2:03:04] I'd rather have a man wrong in his
[2:03:06] doctrine, but with the right spirit."
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can find people who know
[2:03:14] this message and believe this message
[2:03:15] but just ain't got the right spirit.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; The two got to work together.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Examine your life by spirit and truth.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Because our spirit should reflect him
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and the truth of the word should reflect
[2:03:35] him.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Everything about us should reflect
[2:03:38] Christ.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; The one behind us. Amen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; The one living in us. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:03:45] We should never have to exalt ourselves.
[2:03:48] Christ will do that.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Probably want them some of the saints to
[2:04:01] sing the song with me, but it been on my
[2:04:02] heart.

[2:10:33] Lord Jesus,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Father, you are our peace, Lord.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, and you cover us, Lord, when we're
[2:10:41] hurting, Lord.
[2:10:44] You cover us, Lord, when all hope is
[2:10:46] gone, Lord.
[2:10:48] Lord, and we want that peace, Lord God,
[2:10:50] that surpasses all that we can
[2:10:53] understand, Lord.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; And you are that peace, Lord.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, without you, we are nothing, Lord.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Without you, the service is nothing.
[2:11:03] And Lord, we believe that your spirit is
[2:11:05] here. We believe that the true divine
[2:11:07] revelation of the word
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; was preached tonight.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we ask Lord in our own
[2:11:13] individual lives that you would come and
[2:11:16] consume our sacrifice. [music]
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, if we're truly in your presence,
[2:11:22] Lord, Father, there are needs in this
[2:11:25] place.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, somebody need healings in their
[2:11:28] body. Father, Lord, we've heard the
[2:11:31] truth. You are the Lord thy God that
[2:11:34] health from all our sicknesses and
[2:11:36] diseases. You are Jehovah Rafa. We
[2:11:40] believe that to be truth
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; and we receive it by spirit.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, touch those bodies right now
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[2:11:52] Lord God, some are praying for loved
[2:11:54] ones,
[2:11:56] daughters that are out in the world
[2:12:00] who've heard this truth.
[2:12:02] Mothers of burden for their daughters.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray you take away that burden
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; and put a spirit of confidence there.
[2:12:13] Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; That can speak back to the heart of a
[2:12:17] parent that says if you've raised them
[2:12:19] up in the way that they should go, it
[2:12:22] doesn't matter what they may do.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; That the word will make them free
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; against their own will. It'll make them
[2:12:32] free because we have a promise that the
[2:12:34] Holy Ghost is unto us and our children
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; and even our children's children.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to whomsoever is far off.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, these are the promises that you've
[2:12:46] given that are here tonight on display,
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we've spoken about you to be
[2:12:52] that big God that you are.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, it is so beyond houses and cars
[2:12:58] and all these things, but you're a God
[2:13:01] of satisfaction.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a God of confidence.
[2:13:06] You're a God of deliverance. You're a
[2:13:08] God of healing and joy.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:11] and every attribute of thy spirit is in
[2:13:13] this room tonight.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just want to connect.
[2:13:19] And Lord, we pray right now if there's
[2:13:21] someone here who needs to rededicate
[2:13:24] their life, this is your chance.
[2:13:27] All heads bow, eyes closed.
[2:13:30] You personally may not have been living
[2:13:32] up to the standard of spirit and truth.
[2:13:37] Maybe you've seen it in a parent and
[2:13:40] down in way down in your heart, you've
[2:13:42] been craving it, but you feel like
[2:13:45] you've been bound. That spirit has come
[2:13:47] to set you free tonight.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been longing to rededicate
[2:13:54] your life and live for him because in
[2:13:56] the world you've been hurt.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; This is your night for healing.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:04] All heads bow, eyes closed.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; If God is talking to you to rededicate
[2:14:10] your life,
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; the only person looking at your heart is
[2:14:13] God.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; And if you raise your hand, the only one
[2:14:16] looking at your hand is God. You want to
[2:14:19] rededicate your life, lift your hands to
[2:14:21] the Lord.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Right now in the name of Jesus.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless each and every
[2:14:29] hand.
[2:14:31] But I want to take it a step further.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; You in your heart, you know God is
[2:14:37] talking to you.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; And you didn't raise your hand. This is
[2:14:40] the grace of God still coming after you.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; God don't want your hand. He wants your
[2:14:47] heart.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; If you'll just surrender, he'll do the
[2:14:51] rest.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Because it's by his spirit that we are
[2:14:55] saved.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; It's his spirit that allows us to
[2:14:58] triumph. Don't you want to have that
[2:15:00] life of triumph?
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, it comes with battles. It comes
[2:15:04] with struggle. But it also comes with
[2:15:06] victory.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Will you give God your heart tonight?
[2:15:11] This church was put here to be a
[2:15:13] hospital
[2:15:16] to redeem souls.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And you've come tonight to hear about
[2:15:20] spirit and truth.
[2:15:22] Will you just get your spirit right?
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Receive God in your heart
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; by faith.
[2:15:28] All he wants you to do to accept
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Father, you saw the hands
[2:15:37] that were lifted to you.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; And they didn't lift their hands to me,
[2:15:42] but they lifted to you, Lord.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; For Lord, you said through a prophet
[2:15:46] that in this room, in another dimension,
[2:15:49] that's faster than the eye can see, that
[2:15:51] there are angels in the walls of this
[2:15:53] room. And if angels are here, God is
[2:15:56] here
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; because their whole job is to exalt the
[2:15:59] Lord
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; or to send out the message given from
[2:16:05] God.
[2:16:07] And Lord, you've sent angels in this
[2:16:09] room to deliver.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; You sent angels in this room to exalt
[2:16:14] you.
[2:16:17] So I pray for you that lift your hand
[2:16:19] for rededication unto God.
[2:16:22] that you would in this moment no longer
[2:16:25] doubt that rededication.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; But receive the strength to [music] live
[2:16:30] on
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; receive the strength in happiness and in
[2:16:34] joy and in victory and in triumph
[2:16:37] through every battle, through every
[2:16:38] struggle in Jesus Christ's name right
[2:16:41] now.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; To every hand that was raised, receive
[2:16:45] that spirit and thy truth
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; because thy word is truth.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you can say amen to the
[2:16:52] word
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; with the right spirit,
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; you can be rededicated tonight.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; And to that heart
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; that's on the fence.
[2:17:04] That's to that heart that's young and
[2:17:06] yearning for a better life. All you got
[2:17:09] to do is receive it tonight.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Just receive him.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about Brother Diggs. Don't
[2:17:15] worry about the ministry in this church.
[2:17:18] Just realize that tonight you heard from
[2:17:20] God.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; And if you heard from God, he will
[2:17:23] continue to deal with you.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, touch that heart. Touch that life,
[2:17:29] that rededicated heart right now.
[2:17:37] Peace
[2:17:38] of God, cover me.
[2:17:45] Cover me.
[2:17:48] Pastor cover me.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; The spirit is here.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; this is your time to receive it.
[2:18:08] Cover me.
[2:18:11] Seek with me. Peace of God. Peace of
[2:18:15] God.
[2:18:17] Cover me
[2:18:19] through the storm. Through the storm.
[2:18:24] The Bible says as Peter spake those
[2:18:26] words, the Holy Ghost fell and the Holy
[2:18:29] Ghost is receiving the word for your
[2:18:30] day. Peace [music]
[2:18:33] of God, cover [singing] me. The Holy
[2:18:37] Ghost is here tonight through the storm.
[2:18:44] Cover me. One more time. Peace of God.
[2:18:49] Peace.
[2:18:51] Take full advantage of the opportunity
[2:18:55] to put down your down payment
[2:18:58] to receive the earnest
[2:19:01] of resurrection power, the earnest of
[2:19:04] immortality, and that's the Holy Ghost
[2:19:09] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Through the stone. Only
[2:19:25] you.
[2:19:32] Only in you I'm [music] secure.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:40] Only in you [music] I find peace.
[2:19:44] Yes.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; So cover me.
[2:19:51] [music]
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I am hurting.
[2:19:59] Cover me [music] when I'm not strong.
[2:20:03] Cover me when I [singing]
[2:20:04] am [music] going through the storm.
[2:20:10] Cover [music] me when all seems
[2:20:13] hopeless. Cover me when my faith is
[2:20:16] gone.
[2:20:18] Let the [music] peace that passes all I
[2:20:22] understand.
[2:20:26] Co.
[2:20:34] Amen. God bless you tonight. Maybe just
[2:20:37] stand with me as we begin to close.
[2:20:41] Certainly like to welcome our visitors.
[2:20:44] God bless you, Sister Huckle, Sister
[2:20:47] Lana,
[2:20:49] and each one who's made the effort to
[2:20:50] come out tonight. I believe that we have
[2:20:53] heard from God.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; We haven't heard from a man.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; We heard from the Lord Jesus who is
[2:21:00] here.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Rose, God bless you. It's good to
[2:21:03] see you.
[2:21:05] You know, just the one thing that you
[2:21:07] said tonight, brother, is just so so
[2:21:10] true.
[2:21:12] It's so much better to have the right
[2:21:14] spirit in our lives
[2:21:17] with the wrong doctrine
[2:21:20] and not be so fussed on all of the
[2:21:23] little tiny things. And we say they're
[2:21:25] little tiny things, but sometimes we can
[2:21:28] strain at the knat
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; and have a beam in our own eye.
[2:21:35] And that's a terrible place to be.
[2:21:39] But getting the right spirit is the
[2:21:40] critical key.
[2:21:42] Getting in the spirit. I was having the
[2:21:44] conversation today at the graveside.
[2:21:46] It's all about getting in the spirit.
[2:21:48] It's all about his [music] spirit.
[2:21:50] Outside of his spirit, we just have a
[2:21:52] bunch of knowledge. We just have a bunch
[2:21:55] of wisdom and a bunch of knowledge.
[2:21:58] But we're not going to get to that level
[2:22:00] of faith that we need to to change our
[2:22:02] bodies.
[2:22:04] You know, I'm not going to preach.
[2:22:07] I'm just going to say let's just [music]
[2:22:09] have a word of prayer.
[2:22:12] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:22:14] you for this day. We thank you, Lord,
[2:22:16] for the service tonight.
[2:22:18] We know that you have spoken, Lord, and
[2:22:21] we receive it the way that you've given
[2:22:23] it.
[2:22:25] Lord, we're not interested in making
[2:22:26] excuses.
[2:22:28] We don't want to try and mix something
[2:22:31] with this word for our day. We don't
[2:22:33] want a hybrid religion. That's the
[2:22:35] reason why parents have children
[2:22:37] sometimes that just don't want to serve
[2:22:39] you because they're they see their
[2:22:41] parents mixing something with the word.
[2:22:44] There's something not true. There's
[2:22:46] something not right. Why would children
[2:22:48] want to serve a God like that? Father,
[2:22:51] we pray that you would help us to
[2:22:53] repent. Help us, Lord Jesus, to come
[2:22:55] unto you and ask you, Father, to forgive
[2:22:59] us,
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We know that's the zeal of
[2:23:02] the age is to repent. Father, every one
[2:23:04] of us, every day, we need to repent.
[2:23:07] Father, we need to just go on our knees
[2:23:09] and ask you, Father, to let us die so
[2:23:12] that you could live in our lives so that
[2:23:15] your spirit would lead us, that your
[2:23:17] spirit would guide us, that your spirit
[2:23:19] would speak through us, that your spirit
[2:23:21] would think through us. Forgive us for
[2:23:24] thinking that we could ever do it on our
[2:23:25] own, Lord. Oh father, it takes you in
[2:23:28] every aspect of our lives.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just thank you for
[2:23:33] ministering to us. Lord, we pray for
[2:23:36] those who couldn't come here tonight,
[2:23:37] Father, for whatever the reason. Maybe
[2:23:40] sickness, Lord Jesus. Maybe work, maybe
[2:23:43] just indifference and coldness of
[2:23:46] spirit. But Father, we just want to send
[2:23:48] the agent of your Holy Spirit after
[2:23:50] those people specifically, Lord, that
[2:23:53] they would have a renewed zeal in their
[2:23:55] life, Father, to want to get together
[2:23:57] with your spirit, [music]
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; and be in that atmosphere. And Father,
[2:24:02] those who are traveling away, Lord, we
[2:24:04] pray that you would just keep your hand
[2:24:06] upon them. Thank you for bringing the
[2:24:07] other travelers home safely, Lord.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for the testimony
[2:24:12] of Sister Jine's life, Lord. Father, the
[2:24:16] funeral service today. Thank you for the
[2:24:18] celebration, Lord. Father, thank you for
[2:24:20] the many testimonies, Lord. Father, the
[2:24:23] many lives that she touched. Father, we
[2:24:26] pray that you would just comfort those,
[2:24:27] Lord, whose hearts are broken.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, as we go our separate ways
[2:24:32] tonight, we pray that you would just be
[2:24:34] glorified. We pray that you would be the
[2:24:37] central theme of our lives, Lord Jesus.
[2:24:39] That when we lay our heads down on the
[2:24:41] pillow, that we would think about your
[2:24:43] spirit. that when we wake up in the
[2:24:45] morning, oh Father, we would consider,
[2:24:47] do we have your spirit,
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Father, that you would be the one
[2:24:52] leading us,
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; oh Father, and if it's your will for us
[2:24:55] to gather again tomorrow, we will bring
[2:24:57] a sacrifice of praise, Father. We won't
[2:25:00] be looking for who's here except for
[2:25:02] you. We will be looking to meet your
[2:25:04] spirit once again.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ. Father, we
[2:25:09] pray Lord also that you would restore
[2:25:11] Brother Cadre's strength, that you would
[2:25:13] grant to him a fresh coal off the altar,
[2:25:16] Lord, that you would watch over his
[2:25:18] family while he's away, Lord. That you
[2:25:20] would just lead him and guide him while
[2:25:22] he's here.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we just love you and we
[2:25:25] thank you tonight. We just commit this
[2:25:27] service now into your hands and each
[2:25:29] life here in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:25:32] pray.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? He is our peace.
[2:25:39] He has broken down every wall.
[2:25:45] He is [singing] our [music] peace
[2:25:50] who has broken down every wall.
[2:25:59] He is our [music] peace.
[2:26:06] is
[2:26:08] our peace.
[2:26:13] He is
[2:26:15] our peace
[2:26:18] who has broken down everyone.
[2:26:27] He is our peace.
[2:26:35] is of
[2:26:38] just cast all your cares
[2:26:41] cast [music and singing] all your cares
[2:26:45] on him
[2:26:48] for he cares [music]
[2:26:50] for you
[2:26:56] Heat. Heat.
[2:27:08] asking [music] for your hands on you
[2:27:15] for
[2:27:17] you.
[2:27:34] Can we sing Holy [music] Spirit rain
[2:27:36] down?
[2:27:40] I know we have to have service tomorrow.
[2:27:43] If you have to go, you're more than
[2:27:44] welcome to.
[2:27:46] Something about his presence. We'll just
[2:27:48] sing this chorus here.
[2:27:51] Holy Spirit break
[2:27:56] down,
[2:27:59] break
[2:28:03] down

[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus.
[2:30:05] There's just something about your name.
[2:30:08] We can say that name, but what about
[2:30:11] your name? What about making it personal
[2:30:13] tonight?
[2:30:15] Jesus.
[2:30:18] Oh, Jesus. [music]
[2:30:22] Jesus.
[2:30:24] Jesus.
[2:30:29] There's just something
