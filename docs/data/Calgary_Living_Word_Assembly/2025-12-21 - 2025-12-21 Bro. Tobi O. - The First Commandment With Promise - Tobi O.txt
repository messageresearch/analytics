[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. God bless each one of you. Welcome once again the house of the Lord. Visitors in each one. God bless you [music] richly this morning. Good to be here on a Sunday morning right around the Christmas season. Family gathered in. We're uh just always a wonderful time of the year to celebrate with one another, but just to enjoy each other's company. and each one of you, Sister Rose, wherever she is. She uh left the left left the room for a bit, but she traveled in from uh Pincher Creek area as well. So, good to have each one out this [music] morning. Let's start this this morning. The name of the Lord is a strong [music] and mighty tower. The righteous run into it and are saved. Aren't you glad for that promise this morning? Well, the name of [singing] the Lord is a strong [singing and music] tower. The righteous run into it [music] and they are [singing] saved. The name of the Lord [music] is a strong cow. The righteous [singing] run [music] into it and they are saved. [music and singing] Oh yes. Blessed be the name of the [music] Lord. Blessed [singing] be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of [music] the Lord most high. Oh [music] blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name of the [singing] Lord. Blessed be the [music] name of the Lord most high. The [singing] name of the Lord is [music] a strong cow. The righteous running to it and they are save. [music] The name of the Lord is a strong tower. [music] The righteous [singing] run into it and they are saved. [music and singing] Blessed [music] be the name of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name [music and singing] of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. [music] Oh, [singing] blessed be the [singing] name of the [music] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord most [music] high. [singing] Give me your hand. Let's agree together. And all of our enies [music] [singing] will crumble at our knees. [music] Whatever we find on earth shall be bound [music] in heaven. Oh, and the name of Jesus. [music and singing] Satan has [music and singing] we got the power in the name [music] of Jesus. We got the power. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we've got the power in the [music and singing] name of the Lord.

[applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have the revelation that you're not fighting flesh and blood but principality of darkness and you can separate the person from the demon and just come against Satan, not come against [music] the person. It's a wonderful revelation when you get that and you I know I talking to my wife this week. You just look at at challenges and trials differently, [music] what people are doing to you. You can separate that. Say, "Lord, that's just the devil. Satan, I come against you and it defeats you in the name of the Lord Jesus." That's the way it is. And you can pray for the person or they might try to destroy you. It's a wonderful thing. Believe it's an attribute of Christ. He did that. He died for us. What a day that will be. Just the chorus this [music] morning. Maybe you can stand with me. Oh, what [singing] a day that will be. [music] When my Jesus [singing] I shall see. When I [music] look upon his face and what he say [music and singing] by his grace. When he takes [singing] me by the hand [music] and he leads me through and promises. [singing] Oh, what a day [music] and glorious day that will be. Oh, [music] what a day that will be. [singing] Oh my Jesus. When I look [music and singing] upon his face [music] [singing] and he takes [music] me by and he leads [singing] me through [music] and promis [music] one more time brother saint will you come brother saint [music] Oh, what a [singing] day that will be. Oh, my Jesus. [music] Oh, [singing] when I [music] see [singing] [music] me [singing] by the hands [music] me that promise. Oh, [music] what a day. [music] Shall bow our heads and pray. Almighty father in heaven, Lord, we give you thanks and praise this morning. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your love. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your kindness upon our life.

In Jesus victorious name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you once again. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this morning. have a little bit of a Christmas theme. I just did a little research on some songs here this morning. Some of you might know this, but it's rather interesting. So, the great awakening as Charles Wesley was part of that great awakening and and uh through that period, [music] the man age after after Luther, but his song was written almost 300 years ago, 1730 [music] somewhere in there. And Charles Wesley wrote approximately 6,000 hymns in his lifetime. 6,000 hymns. So very much like Fanny Crosby just was known and renowned for his hymnwriting. 300 years ago, Hark the Herald Angels sing. And this song is sung by many. And when you read the words, they're so pertinent. They're so powerful. Let's sing it with Revelation this morning. We know that Christ wasn't born this time of year, but he was born and he came for us. He came to redeem us. Let's sing it this morning with Revelation. Oh, the herald [singing] angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. Peace [music] on earth and mercy. God [music and singing] and sin is reconiled. Joyful [singing] all the [music] nations rise. [singing] Join the triumph of the skies [music and singing] with angel proclaim. Christ [music] is born in [singing] Bethlehem. The herald angels sing. Glory to our newborn king. [music] Christ by highest heaven adore. Christ the everlasting [singing and music] Lord made great in time. Behold him come [music] up of virgin failed [music and singing] in flesh. Oh God see he [singing] be incarnate. [music] Please [singing] man to hear [music] Jesus now you hear [singing] heart [music] the herald angels sing. [singing] Glory to [music] the newborn king. Hail the hill for prince [music] of peace. Hail the son of rightuousness. [singing] Light and life to [music] all he brings. Risen with healing [singing] [music] in his grace. mouth. He [singing] lays his glory by. Born and man [music and singing] died. Born to raise the [music] son of earth. Born [singing] to give the sacred heart the [singing] angels [music] sing. Glory to the [music] newborn king. Come desire of [music] nations [singing] come fix in us thy humble home. Christ the moment [singing] [music] we see bruising us the ser [music] and it li [singing] now [music] stand by the age [singing] in it [music and singing] state of thy Now heart the herald angels sing glory to the newborn [music] king. Chuckling inside, smiling inside as I think about Charles Wesley, our brother 300 years ago. He had quite the revelation when he wrote that, didn't he? He knew about the deity and boy, just just how God's faithfulness all the way through. Here we are for this song. This was written by a last name gentleman by the name of Wade. But that first song was actually uh Mendlesson actually added the music to that as a commemoration the 400th year of the of the invention of the Gutenberg press. So we know with the Goodenberg press came the Bible the printing of the Bible. So a lot of these things so many things God did just allowed things to happen. [music] Of course the world thinks it's something different. We know it's different. We know exactly why it was printed. that like the recording was was created in our day for the prophet's message. We know that was for us. The printing of the printed the the Gutenberg printing press was printed or invented for the Bible. All these things are wonderful and just wonderful to just enjoy the history of this but sing it with revelation this [music] morning. Oh come all you faithful. Any faithful here this morning &gt;&gt; by the grace of God I'm faithful not because of me but because of the life he's placed in me. Let's sing it this morning. Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant. Oh come ye, oh come ye to. [singing] [music] Oh come [singing] and behold [music] him for [singing] the king of angels. [music] Oh come let us adore him. Oh [music and singing] come let us adore him. Oh come [music] let us adore [singing] him. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The Lord seems [music and singing] singing [singing and music] exaltation. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; will see all ye citizens of heaven [music] above any mighty citizens of heaven this morning. Oh, glory [music] to God. [singing] Oh, glory [music] in the [singing] highest. Oh, let us [music] adore [singing] him. Oh come let us adore him. [music] Oh come let us adore [music] him. Christ the Lord. [singing] Lord [music] we ge [singing] this happy morning [music] [singing] Jesus to thee all [singing] glory [music] word of the [singing] father [music] Now in flesh appearing. [music] Oh come [singing] let us adore [music] him. Oh come [singing] let us adore [music] him. Oh come [singing] let us adore [music] Christ the [singing] Lord [music] for he alone is worthy [singing] for he [music] alone is worthy for he [singing] alone is worthy. Christ [music] the Lord. [singing] If you want deacons when he come, we'll give him all the [singing] glory. [music] We give him all the glory. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Christ [music] Lord. [singing] Oh come let us adore him. Oh [singing] come let us adore him. Oh [singing] come let us adore [music] him. [singing] for us Lord. Why don't we give that Lord a clap offering of praise and we adore him this morning. Thank you Lord. We adore you Lord. [applause and music] God bless you saints. Let's bow our hearts for prayer. Our dear heavenly father, that is the reason why we've gathered here this morning to adore you, to worship you, Lord. Father, looking at the people, looking at your children gathered here, Lord, it is only you that can gather us together around your word this morning, Father. And we've come to say thank you for your grace, Lord. Yesterday we didn't know what we were doing out there. But today we are here and we want to leave everything aside and [music] praise your name this morning Lord. We want to come out of our hearts no obligation &gt;&gt; to say thank you and to praise you Lord. &gt;&gt; Each one of us Lord we have to come according to our faith this morning &gt;&gt; to worship the king. &gt;&gt; You are so worthy to be worshiped this morning Lord. Father, we went to sleep and we did not know how we get up, Lord. But this morning, if blood is flowing through us this morning, we have every reason to rejoice in what you have done for us this morning. We want to say thank you for each and everyone, Lord. This morning that has gathered here this morning, Lord. And this morning, Lord, we know your word is about to come forth. Father, we know that we have needs among us this morning. &gt;&gt; We bring them all together, Lord. Father, may you bless the service once again. We are bringing your tithe and offering, Father. We pray that you receive it and bless it, Father, for us &gt;&gt; for in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song again. Let's take it up one more key if you wouldn't mind. The first verse, [music] first verse. He's worthy of our glory this morning. First verse of the song we just sang. Oh, come let us adore him. Oh, come [singing] all ye faithful, [singing and music] joyful and triumphant. [music and singing] Oh come ye, oh [singing] come ye to heaven. [music] [singing] Oh come and [music] behold [singing] him born the king of angels. [singing] [music] Oh come let us adore him. Oh come let [singing] us adore him. Oh come let us adore [singing] [music] him. Christ the Lord. For he [singing and music] alone is worthy. For he alone [music] is worthy. For he [music and singing] alone is worthy. [music] Christ [singing] the Lord. [music] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. We have a lot of specials this morning and so sorry it'll take a little longer for song service this morning, but uh Sister Kindness, if you'd start the service this morning and then Sister Adena, I believe has a special and then the choir and then we're going to have a Sunday school group at the last. So if you come in that order, Sister Kindness, Sister Adena, the choir and then the Sunday school class. God bless you as you enjoy these specials that these folks have brought their gifts to the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. It's not a Christmas song. Sorry. It's just um a testimony for what God has done for me, for my family and my church back home. I just want to say thank you for all your prayers for our brothers released. Um, and for God seeing my sister through an emergency surgery. She had to go this week. I'm just thankful to God that every day we wake up in the morning. We don't know what's going to happen, but he somehow carries us through &gt;&gt; and he has brought me and my family and all of us here through to the end of this year. And I am just here just his little us to just give him back the praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The room grew still as she made [singing] her way to Jesus. She stumbled through the tears that made her blind. [singing] She felt such pain. Some [music] spoke in anger. Her folks whispered, "There's no place here [singing] for your kind." But still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until [singing] at last she knelt before his feet. And though she [singing] spoke no words, everything she said was hers. as she poured a love for the master from her box of alabaster. [singing] And I've come to pour my praise [music] on him like oil [singing] from Mary's alaster. [singing] Please don't be [singing] angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I try [singing] them with my hand. You went there [singing] the night he found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his love [singing] arms around me. And you don't know the curse of the oil and my alabaster. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I can't forget [singing] [music] the way life used to be. See, I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound. And I've [singing] spent my days I poured my life without measure into a [singing] little treasure box I thought I found. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; until the day when [singing] Jesus came to me and he healed my soul with the wonder of he is touch. [singing] So now I'm giving back to him all the praise he's worthy [singing] of. [music] See, I've been forgi. And that's why I love him so much. I've come to pour my [singing] praise onto him like oil [music] from Mary's alabaster [singing] bus. [music] So please don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I dry them with my hair. [singing] She were there the night he found me. [music] You did not feel what I felt [singing] when he wrapped his loving arms around me. [music] And you don't know the curse of my oil. You don't know the curse of my praise. [singing] You don't know the curse of the oil. In my [singing] head turn. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you all. I come to you with the weight [singing] of all my stress. You pick me up and let me catch my breath. Lord, [singing and music] you never condemn, never make a list of wrongs. In the light of your goodness, all the fear I've known is gone. I'm safe in your arms, [singing] your arms of love. I'm safe in your arms. [singing] Your arms are love. And all of my heart, [singing] my hope, my trust is he and safe in your arms. Your arms [singing] alone. [music] I'm safe in [singing] your arms, your arms of love. You were [singing] there when there was nothing left. A spark [singing and music] of hope where I saw emptyness. Somehow [singing] even in pieces you restore me with your peace. In [music] the dest of bless the everending stream, safe in your arms, your arms [singing] of love. I'm safe in your arms, your arms of [singing] love. All of my heart, my hope, [singing] my trust is held. I'm safe in your arms, your arms [singing] of alone. I'm safe in your arms, your arms [singing] of love. And the only shadow [singing] I see is a shadow of your wings. The shadow [singing] of your wings. And the only shelter [singing] I need is a [singing] shadow of your wings. The shadow of [singing] your [music] wings. I'm safe in [singing] your arms. Your arms are alone. [singing and music] I'm safe in your arms. your arms of love. [singing and music] All of my heart, [singing] my hope, [music] my trust is held. I'm safe in your [singing] arms. Your [music] arms, oh Lord. I'm safe in your arms. [singing] Your arms. all alone. [music] God bless you all. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; While the shepherds kept their watching for silent [singing] flocks by night, behold throughout the [music and singing] heaven &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills [music and singing] and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain that [music] Jesus [singing] Christ is born. as you [music] tr [music] [music] it [singing] on the mountain, over the hills [music] and everywhere. [singing] Oh my Jesus [music] [singing] manger the humble Christ. [music] God sent [singing] us salvation and blessed Christmas. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Jesus [music] Christ. Go tell [singing] it on the mountain, [music] over the hills and everywhere. Go [singing] tell it on the mountain [music] that Jesus Christ is [singing] born. Go tell it on the mountain. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Why don't we give everyone another round of applause? Thank you [applause] for all the gifts this morning. If you stand with me, I believe the choir story of the Sunday school is going to be next Sunday. So, that was my my mistake. Next Sunday, we'll hear from the uh young folks. Looking forward to that. Looking forward to the word now [music] as we change the atmosphere of the service this morning. As we kind of change the tone as it were. Let's move down to 10:52. Word of God. Ever true. It's where we came here to receive this morning. Long preserved. Here we are walking in this word that the Lord descended [music] with, proved, vindicated. Heard the prophet the other day talking about all the things he said. See now he did in one service more than he's been recorded in his entire earthly ministry. He said that then he said then the tens of thousands of times he's done it besides this and I thought you know there's just no excuse. The [music] whole world has heard the whole world's had the vindicated message around and around the world. But here we are this little group of people seeds of God that I believe God's sporting for the foundation of the world. Here we are this morning. What a work of grace he's done in each of our lives. We have so much to be thankful for. Lord, will you just change me with your word as we hear it this morning? Oh, holy word, long preserved for our one in [music] this world. They resound with God's own heart. [singing and music] Oh, let the ancient words impart. Word of God, [music] it's ever true. It's changing me [music and singing] and changing you. We have come [music] with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words [singing] of life, words of hope. It [music] gives us strength [singing] and helps us grow. In this [singing and music] world where we roam the word of [music] God will guide us [singing] of God [music] is never [singing] true. Is changing me and changing [music] you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God imparty [music and singing] words of our faith. They were handed down [music and singing] to this age. Oh, they came to us through [music] sacrifice. Oh, he [singing] the faithful words of Christ. Father Mary, would you come? The word of God ever true is changing [music and singing] me and it's changing you have [singing] come with open hearts. Oh, let the [music] word of God when you come, brother. Oh, [singing] word of God. [music] It's ever true. [music] We have come with open [music and singing] hearts. Let the word of God impart. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Welcome [music] to the house of the Lord. We certainly thank the Lord for his goodness and his mercy to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Today I just want to welcome our visitors. We have uh sister an Anna from Ghana staying with uh Sar Pongs. God bless you, sister. [applause] And sister Mary Olerte has, I think, [music] her entire family here with her today. God richly bless each and every one of you. [applause] &gt;&gt; And if I'm not mistaken, um [music] I'm so sorry I forget your name, but I do know that we prayed for you in Colombia. Is that right? This is the sister that had had the cancer, had such a terrible testimony from the doctors, but we went to the great physician and we stood with you up here in Calgary and we're so thankful that you could be here today. God bless you, sister. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It truly is an honor to have you with us each and everyone. If I haven't mentioned anyone, forgive me. God bless you and welcome. &gt;&gt; I trust you feel right at home today. &gt;&gt; I have [music] a note. I have a note from sister Jarmaine's sister, the auntie that was here visiting with us. and it was given to me today and asked if I would read it. Happy holidays from Sister Charmaine's sisters. They would like [music] to thank you for welcoming them at church. Unfortunately, they did not have the chance to say goodbye last Wednesday due to the road weather conditions. They're wishing everyone a happy holidays and are thankful for the warm welcome to the church community. God bless you all. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; We certainly are thankful for the testimony of the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even though we have to part ways here on this side of eternity, we know that we will meet [music] again. &gt;&gt; This morning, we're certainly thankful to have uh brother [music] Toby Odenovo taking the service for us. and uh he was actually in Nigeria recently and he [music] was able to fellowship with the church that was enduring the issue with the hostages. Just one of the of the many situations where the extremists are actually taking Christians as hostage. And there's many different outcomes, but the best possible outcome happened in this situation. [music] And we certainly thank the Lord for answering everyone's prayers because we know there is people praying all around the world for this situation. &gt;&gt; So we're certainly thankful for that. And brother Toby is going to take the service today and explain a little bit about that and uh you know a little bit more about what the Lord's put on his heart. [music] We're certainly thankful for him and what the Lord's done for him in his life. So we just want to invite brother Toby to come and maybe we could just sing this song again. Word of God ever true. &gt;&gt; And I I just want to ask the question, how many people want to stay the same that came in the building today? I believe every one of us wants to leave here changed individuals. &gt;&gt; And if not, perhaps something that is said today will tweak that that life inside of us to cause us to want to change, to grow into that that [music] manifested word for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that chorus as we invite brother Toby to come. Oh word of God, ever [music and singing] true, changing me, [music] changing you. We have [singing] come with [music] open hearts. Oh, let [singing] the word of God. [music] Word of God [singing] is true. Changing me, [music] changing you. We have come with heart [music and singing] and the word of God. Holy words of our [music] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; changing changing [music] open [singing] hearts. I let [music] the word of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a privilege and honor to stand before the purchased possession of the Almighty God. Brother said if he had a jar with the blood of Jesus Christ in it, he will be very careful not to make it fall. He said, "If you think about that and then you think about what that Lord purchased, which is you and I, he said, which one will we be more careful about?" &gt;&gt; Because what you buy is greater than what you used to buy it. &gt;&gt; So, we're grateful to God for being here this morning. You might have your seat for a little while. want to thank the pastor for [music] the privilege to stand before you. &gt;&gt; I will spend some minutes to bring the testimony from Nigeria and then [music] we'll get into the word. I recognize we're starting a little bit late. Don't be nervous. I'll try not to be long with you, but if I need to be long, I will ask for permission. And I'm sure everyone will be kind enough to give me a few more minutes. I just want to read a scripture before um Yeah, musicians. Thank you. We should be good. Thank you. God bless you. I'll just read a scripture before um I give a brief testimony of what the Lord did. I'll read from Acts chapter 4 verse 20. just bring in a little bit of context from this um that might be different from the actual context. This is when the apostles were arrested for their faith and for what the Lord started to do as the New Testament church was starting and they had been taken and you know they had beaten them and dealt with them in a bad way. And uh Peter and John was replying to those that said they shouldn't talk about Jesus Christ. Verse 20 says, "For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." And I think that's what testimonies are about &gt;&gt; to say the things that we have seen &gt;&gt; and the things we have heard. &gt;&gt; So I'll just uh start with a little bit about the country Nigeria for those that don't know. There's so many Nigerians in here. So if I get anything wrong, I'm sure they can correct me. But I think I'm I'm Nigerian enough to to get it right. So Nigeria is uh one of the many countries in Africa. It's on the west 10 part of Africa, the west coast of Africa. And uh the estimated population is about 230 to 237 million people. Um, they also say that one out of every four black people you meet is Nigerian. So we we're many there are many of us around the world. We have hundreds of ethnic groups about more than 250 ethnic groups and although English is the official language, there are more than 500 indigenous languages that are spoken across the country. the three of them that are the main um languages, but if you have to get to the dialects, there are about more than 500 of them. So, don't see a Nigerian and say, "Do you speak Nigerian?" Because [laughter] there's nothing about there's nothing that's called Nigerian when it comes to language. Uh there is Heb, there's Yoruba and Husa. Those are the three major ones. Um, Lagos is where the message church where uh the brothers that were kidnapped, that's where they came from. I'll also say that uh we have a few people that grew up in that church here. I did not grow up there, but Sister Kindness grew up there. Brother Danielbe grew up there and brother Jason Okawo grew up there. So, um, but we we we moved to there um a few years before we moved to Canada and uh um it just became home to us as well. So Lagos has an estimated population of 17 million people. Um that is about I think Calgary is just about coming up to 2 million. Um so that's that's many eight times almost or more of the size of Calgary. And across Nigeria it's estimated that there are about 612 message churches. Um and this is the account of voice of God. So churches that they support across uh Nigeria are 600 612 and Lagos will have uh definitely will have a large portion of that. um when it comes to percentage of churches that are in the different cities across the country um and the the local Christian assembly Lagos a church in Nigeria um I guess we'll have about 800 to a thousand believers depending on how many people show up in church um we also Lagos being the economic capital of Nigeria it's it's not the political capital but it's it's like uh the biggest city when it comes to trade and all of that. Um, Lagos has uh a lot of people moved to Lagos. They might have lived elsewhere. So, um, churches in Lagos sometimes benefit from that. So, we um already know that seven of our brothers were kidnapped. They were coming from um a funeral service in the eastern part of Nigeria. And um on their way actually there were a few cars or a few buses. They were traveling and uh the the kidnappers actually attacked the the vehicle that had sisters in it. Um and the sisters called and kind of sisters were there. They called the brothers um the vehicle that the brothers were in um and then the brothers had to come um to their rescue so to say. So they they came and um eventually the kidnappers took seven brothers. They were almost going to take eight of them but the vehicle only their ve the vehicle that they used to kidnap them only feed um seven of our brothers. So they they let the sisters go and then the brothers were kidnapped and uh for about 6 days we heard nothing like there was nothing that was uh said um there were no calls there was nothing that uh the families heard and uh of course that would have been a very difficult time because they couldn't tell whether they were alive or something had happened to them. But right after the situation happened, um the news went across the world very fast. Um LCA Lagos is also where the um I'll say the secretary for the voice of God recordings in Nigeria. That's where um he fellowships is one of the ministers there. So he was able to send the news across and uh during the three weeks I I tuned into one of the services um with brother Tims and I was humbled to hear that they were praying for them. So I was very very um interested to know what the Lord did. Um so they were there for about 3 weeks and uh if you remember on the 28 on the 26th of October we were still here and uh we brought the testimony that the brothers had been released. Um I and a few of us had tuned into the service in Lagos that morning because of course there Nigeria is currently eight hours ahead. So we had tuned in and uh it was jubilation and uh celebration in the church. Um um but turns out uh they had not been released yet. It was an action in faith uh because uh the pastor had said that next Sunday we're going to be celebrating the release of our brothers. We're going to have a thanksgiving service here in church. Um so we thought they were released and um we were happy and celebrating and already um making uh just thinking about being there because uh there are certain victories that when it's being celebrated you don't want to watch on the screen. You like to be there in person um because you you were part of the pain. You were part of the process of um calling God on the scene. So we decided uh on this 27th of October, the Monday to make the trip to Nigeria. It was very quick. Um I'll also say was inspired by sister kindness who um we had gone remember that day the 26th there was a um a lot supper service. So we had gone home. She had gone home with us in the afternoon and uh I had gone to take some rest upstairs and came downstairs and uh my wife said well kindness just bought a ticket. she's going to Nigeria. I said, "Is that how you go to Nigeria to just buy a ticket and uh go on uh I don't know how many thousands of kilometers?" Um but I didn't know that God was doing that to also kind of inspire me. So I got home that night. I asked my wife. Um I started checking tickets and the prizes were good. So I looked at my wife and said, "Do we go as well?" She was meant to go for work already and then she said, "Oh, let's all go together." So um we the Lord we prayed about it. I must say that we prayed about it and told the Lord a few things we wanted to see. We wanted to make sure that we wanted to um we asked the Lord that he should grant us favor that I could ask for permission to be away at work and that will be granted. Um Timothy was born here. So at the time he didn't have a Nigerian passport which meant he was a foreigner that was going to need a visa. Um, we also pray that God will make us be able to get a visa very quickly and then uh we also ask that the Lord will keep us all in good health and the Lord answered all of those prayers. &gt;&gt; So we traveled on the 30th of October uh with Sister Kindness as well, my family and sister kindness. We arrived uh early hours of November 1st in Lagos and the Thanksgiving service was on November 2nd. I will say that the service probably took approximately six hours. Um it's it's it's not entirely unusual for LC Legos. See, brother Jason is so um don't worry, we're not doing that tonight. [gasps] But uh it was a service. It was a service. I I was so glad to be home. I already told my musician friends that we're playing together. Um, one of the brothers that was kidnapped um is one of the finest organists I've ever met and a good friend of mine. I remember when they were in captivity, I told the Lord, if Michael gets back to church, if they're released, I will play with Michael. And um God granted that opportunity, that that prayer request. And uh we we had a wonderful service. Um there's too much to say about the service. It was Thanksgiving at at some point uh when the choir was going to sing. It wasn't just the choir actually. It was like everyone came on the platform. I was uh with the musicians at one of the corners and I was sweating too bad because the entire platform was full of people. Full of people dancing. The entire front was full of people celebrating. because it was a great deliverance. And I'll tell you a few things that the Lord did because my curiosity was what did the Lord do in answer to our prayers? It wasn't just their release, but what was happening when they were there? So, it turns out um the people that took them captive um told them that they are part of a a rebel group that is trying to um that is kind of conversing for another country. um like a part of the country to to become uh its own country and they did this to raise money to buy ammunition to be able to fight the Nigerian government. Um that was what they said to them. But one of the brothers that I had the privilege to speak with told me that um as soon as they were they were taken captive, he prayed and said, "Lord, grant us favor before this people." So they took them and they the the place where the vehicle could stop because it couldn't go any further and Nigeria is has a rainforest so that makes it very difficult as well because there are big trees everywhere. They had to walk three hours into the forest to the camp of the kidnappers and uh some of them had to walk barefoot because they told them to take off their shoes. And he said he prayed and so they had a tent where they kept them and at night well during the day and night they had guards on shifts that will come and go and God granted them favor before one of the guards. Uh the guards don't call their personal names. They use code names. But this actual guy told them his name and told them not to be afraid. He said, "We're not going to kill you. All we want is money and uh once we get the money, we'll release you." But there's another group that you should be grateful that you did not get um captured by like they were not the ones that took you because this group will collect the money and we kill you. So um we're not going to kill you. We just want the money. Of course they maltreated them the bit then they did too many things. I like what uh a pastor in Nigeria said. He said we will not boast about what Satan did. We want to boast about what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; So um so I want to talk about a few things that Jesus did. First that God granted them favor before the guards. Um one of the brothers doesn't do well with cold at all. So, um it was it's it's not as cold as here, but at night it gets cold, Nigerian type of cold when it rains. Um and they were they didn't have beds. They they hardly even stood for most of the time. They were either lying down or sitting down. Um and they were lying down on bamboo um bamboo trees. So they like bamboo beds, beds made of bamboo, like just makeshift beds. And at night um one of the brothers would shiver like really shivering and you will hear the bamboo bed really um cringing and all of that and and many times they will just pray and God will come on the scene and and heal them. One of the most spec spectacular miracles that God did for them and sometimes it might be hard to believe this but our God is he does the impossible &gt;&gt; because the Nigerian government knows that they're there and the military knows that they're there. Sometimes they have operations and they will have the military fighter jets that will be shelling those areas. But the brother told me that this particular day they could feel the fighter jet right above the tent shelling but nothing dropped on the tent. &gt;&gt; He said his testimony is he felt that the Lord just put his angels and made them spread their wings so that as those shells were coming down, those bombs were coming down, he was just dispassing them. And um one of the brothers as well um has an atm asthmatic condition and he passed out twice um and they prayed that the Lord restored him as well. So that was also a miracle because in that condition where they couldn't shower for 3 weeks um they they were in distress. they had maltreated them, beaten them, and done all sort of things. Um, for someone to pass out and be able to come back, it was just God's grace. &gt;&gt; Um, and then the strength that God gave them to walk for three hours in the forest, the way in and the way out, it was just the grace of God. So, I want to on behalf of the brothers and the church, thank you all for your prayers. um we will never really be able to tell what the Lord did. &gt;&gt; The whatifs are too many &gt;&gt; that we can only say thank you Lord. And I'll also mention that the grace that God gave the brothers and sisters in the church to react the way God wanted or what the way God wants us to react in situations like this was another miracle. &gt;&gt; The devil wanted to bring panic. The devil wanted to bring uncertainty uncertainty and fear and all of that. But I will tune into the services whilst the brothers were still in captivity and you will find people dancing. You'll find people praising the Lord just like Paul and Silas did. &gt;&gt; And in their pain, in their chains, they continue to praise and I think the Lord was pleased with that. &gt;&gt; So that was the 2nd of November. We had the Thanksgiving service. Um, on the 9th of November, I had the privilege to speak at my father-in-law's church. Um, like I said, there many churches across Lagos and uh, the Lord gave us a message, Jesus is in your sheep, wake him up. An inspiration from the message brother preached called, uh, calling Jesus on the scene. &gt;&gt; And uh, we had testimonies from that service, people that came directly to say that the Lord spoke to them and uh, we're grateful for that. And on the 16th, just a day before we left, uh we had the privilege to speak at brother Daly's church. Brother Daly has been here um a few times. I was here in the summer. Um so we had the opportunity to speak for them. Brother Lee has about 250 people, I guess, in his church. Um and we spoke about uh for this cause, which I I think I took care in March, I guess. Um it turned out that there had been a wedding the night the the Saturday before and the couple were in church on the Sunday. I didn't even remember um until the day before and uh there were testimonies from that service as well. One other testimony I will bring from that service was so they will have morning morning service and evening service and uh the evening we were going to go say goodbye to our friends. So I told brother Dy that I will only take one service. I'm sorry. And as we're closing out the service, he really enjoyed what the Lord did. And he was saying like, I don't even know why you have to, you know, go somewhere else rather than taking the evening service. And he was like, you've got to come back next year. I said, well, we have no plans coming next year. Um, so the Lord had laid it in his heart to invite another brother to take the evening service. um when I told him I wasn't going to take it and uh his associate pastor is my good friend and and that night my friend texted me and said, "Have you listened to the evening service?" I said, "No." And he said, "You've got to listen to it. I'm going to send it to you." So he sent it to me and it turns out that the things that I didn't get a chance to get to, &gt;&gt; that brother preached about it. The brother was he didn't his his title was nothing that had to do with marriage. His title was about prayer &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit led him to talk about marriage. The Holy Spirit led him to take examples the same ones I took in the morning &gt;&gt; to preach on it. So brother Daily came after the service and said well I as a man was thinking the same man needed to come but the Holy Spirit has as many men &gt;&gt; and he knows how to use them. [snorts] So, thank you for your prayers. It was two weeks of being in Nigeria, but uh the Lord was gracious to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise this morning. [applause] All right, if you don't mind, let's be on our feet to go into the word for this morning. It's 13 minutes past 11. We're going to see how we will do this. and we're done by 12. We'll read first from Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 to 28 and maybe you take your seat after so that I don't keep you standing for too long. I'll take my other context scriptures after Genesis 1:26-28. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him, male and female created ye them." And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. You may have your seat for I was going to say for a little while, but we'll see. I'll go to the Psalms uh 1 7 and I'll read from verse 3 to 5. It says, "Lo, children and are an heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youths. Happy is the man that hath his quaver full of them. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Dependenca. You know when people come and like, "Oh, your quaver is not full yet." I'm like, "You don't know the size of my quaver." [laughter] [gasps] So depends on the size of your quaver. God will give you as many arrows. He said, "Happy is a man that has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. &gt;&gt; And very quickly, Ephesians chapter 6 for from verse 1 to three. Ephesians 6 verse 1-3. It says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor thy father and mother, which is the first commandment, with promise, that it may be well with thee, thou mayest live long on the earth. Let's just have a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear father, we are grateful once again for the privilege to be here. We've given a report of what you did and we know that Lord that will bring faith and strength Lord Jesus that we never want that kind of situation but many other situations in our lives that we go through that we'll know that if we can just pray then you will answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ask you bless your word this morning. Speak to us Lord Jesus in your own way &gt;&gt; and let the glory and honor be thine at the end of the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. So I guess the last time I was here I the Lord gave us a message about parenting and someone must have been praying. I don't know if it's the parents that were praying like Lord this was really spicy. Can you give my kids something to or maybe the kids praying like Lord you spoke to the parents will you speak with me as well? So right after this that service uh this thought came into my heart and uh I just trusted that the Lord would give us an opportunity as his own appointed time and uh he pleased the Lord that it is right now. So kids, the Lord is thinking about giving you your Christmas present just before Christmas. I want to speak this morning on a title, the first commandment with promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first commandment with promise but said in the message leadership speaking to children he said you know Jesus loves little children &gt;&gt; you know he does and there was a little boy one time named Moses we're going to talk about him in just a little bit and he was a very fine you know what made him helped make him a fine boy he had a good mother to raise him See that's what she taught him about the Lord. And you little boys and girls has got the same kind of mothers to raise you, teach you about the Lord. Just mind them. So children, brother Abraham is saying, mind your parents. You know what? You know what the first commandment is in the Bible? The first commandment with promise. with a promise. Maybe a little hard for you to understand this commandment. The first commandment is not to have any other god but him. But the great commandment, the first commandment that has a promise to it, see, is to the children. Did you know that? He said, "Children, obey your parents, which may lengthen the days upon the earth that the Lord thy God has given thee to mind your parents and do what you're doing. It may give you longer life upon the earth &gt;&gt; that the Lord has given you more time to serve him. &gt;&gt; I hope today that I'm making I'm looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelists of the day that is to come. If there is a day after ours. So, brother Abraham was saying there is you are the future. You children today are the future. I was anytime I'm in the pastor's room, my eyes will just go to that picture that was taken. I can't remember where it was. I I wasn't here. Um it it was 12 years ago. 12 years ago. Anyone that is below 12 years that was here at that time was not born yet. But if you look at those that were there, I'm looking at Andy, [laughter] they looked so tiny. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. And if you look at even the adults, they look younger than they look now. But 12 years has come and gone. And gradually the children of that time are becoming the adults of today. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So that means that at that time we could say that they are the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that is the future of the past is today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram is saying that I'm looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelists of that of the day that is to come if there's a day after ours. But that is dependent on how the children listens and obeys their parents. &gt;&gt; Now I want to start with the fact that it was God's design. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That they are parents and that there are children. It was God's design that parents will have children. We read in Genesis 1, the Lord said, "Be fruitful after he made man." Remember, he made the spirit man. He had not yet created flesh for him. And he said, "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth." So God was saying that I want you to have children. Now God made Adam and Eve, he made them as adults. God could have used the same process to make the rest of us. But it was God's design that man and woman will come together to have children. Now, why did God give us parents? According to the scripture, the first reason is that God gave us parents to train us up. That's why the wisest king told us in Proverbs, he said, "Train up a child in the way that he should go &gt;&gt; and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Now, training or training up will also mean to initiate or to discipline. Sometimes when you use the word initiate, you understand it better when it comes to the point of view of cults. &gt;&gt; When you talk about initiation, it's a process to make someone who's not a member of a cult to become a member of that cult. In becoming a member, there are rules. in becoming a member. There are things they do. There are ways to behave. And the word the the the the the Hebrew word that was used for train up which you'll pronounce as chanak also translates to initiate. Now I'm not saying that we must indoctrinate our children. But the responsibility that God gave parents over your children is to bring you up in a way that they tell you the values that they want you to um um incure in your life, the values to embibe in your life, the way you should live your life. And brother prefaced it by saying that Moses had a godly mother. And because Moses had a godly mother, the godly mother was going to train Moses up or did train Moses up in the way of the Lord. So you have a responsibility to obey your parents because God has given them a responsibility to bring you up. &gt;&gt; Now, as we're thinking about this as adults, we are also children of God. &gt;&gt; So we can also apply that to us as God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. The second reason why God gave us parents, the second responsibility that God gave parents over us children is that our parents are to diligently teach us God's word. Now you remember that God will have his first church. Brother said the first church was Israel coming out of Egypt journeying to the promised land. And as they came out of Egypt, it got to a point where God started to give them instructions. Now you are a church. A church must have order. A church must have conduct. A church must have doctrine. They were God's people in Egypt. But brother said that when they came out of Egypt, they became God's church. And that's how God started to give them instructions on how they must behave, how they must live together, what they allowed to do, what they are not allowed to do. Now God knowing that he did not just want that for that single generation gave the parents a responsibility to diligently teach their children God's word. So he tells us in Deuteronomy he said here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. And this word which I commandest this day, I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. Now the parents have the responsibility to make sure that the word is in their heart. But he did not stop there. He said, "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children." So when your parents gather you together and have a family devotion and they're going through a Bible study, they are doing exactly what God wants them to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And children, we must not take that for granted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou shalt and shall talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou riseest up." If you start to think about this, it gets to a point you start to ask yourself, is it all about the word of God? Maybe your parents will remind you what the word of God said in every situation. Maybe about school, maybe about your diligence with school work. They will always point back to the word of God. And you're like, why do you spiritualize everything? They are just doing what God said they should do. &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. He said, you shall diligently take them to your children. You will talk of them when you are sitting down in your house. You will talk of them when you are walking by the way, taking a walk, taking the your dog on a walk with your parents and they start to tell you about the Bible. That's exactly what God said they should do. And when thou liest down, maybe you're young, your parents come and you say, "I want I want you to tell me a story, a bedtime story." And daddy says, "I'm going to tell you about Moses." Said, "No, I want to know about Harry Potter. But God said they should tell you the same things you hear in church even when you're lying down. &gt;&gt; And when you rise up, we wake up in the morning. We gather the children together at breakfast table. We tell them about the word. Parents are only doing what God said they should do. He said, "And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand." Why? So that they remember it could be bracelets on their hand was what the Lord was saying just to keep it right in front of them every time. And they shall be as frontless between thy h thine thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on the gates. In Isaiah he said and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the peace of thy children. &gt;&gt; Amen. God-given parents the responsibility to diligently teach the children the word of God. When you talk about diligent, it means it's continuous. It means it's intentional. It means that they never give up on doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when you don't smile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Another responsibility that God gave parents is they are to provide for our needs. First Timothy, Peter, Paul was saying to Timothy, he said, "But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he had denied the faith and is worse than an infidel." So we know that actually the story here was it had to do with widows in the church who were like very dependent on the church and and uh it was becoming a financial problem or a financial management problem in the church and and Paul was saying that people that can take care of their family members who are widows should do it right. But &gt;&gt; though that was the context, this still covers providing for the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he didn't say widow, he said for his own. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Which means his children, his extended family, his nuclear family. So God has given our parents as children the responsibility to take care of us as well as they can. Brother Abraham advised parents. He said, "Make your home so sweet that your children can bring their friends to the house." &gt;&gt; I'd rather for my kids, I'd rather their friends come for the play date in my house &gt;&gt; than for &gt;&gt; me to take them to their friend's house on the play date &gt;&gt; just so that they in the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Now, our parents correct us and we're going to get to it. It is naturally difficult at certain age to appreciate the correction. I won't say to take the correction. I'll say appreciate the correction because sometimes you take the correction but you don't appreciate it. Now, Proverbs tells us the importance of responding to correction. I'm speaking slowly because I'm speaking to children. So, I'm trying not to preach. I'm trying to just have it as a conversation. I do want to be here and they there, right? Let's be at the same level &gt;&gt; as we go through the word. &gt;&gt; Everyone loves the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the wisest king advises us children. He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction, but he that refuseth reprove er that is going in the wrong way. And then he also told us in Proverbs 15, he said, "A fool despiseth his father's instruction, but he that regardeth reprove is prudent." And prudent means smart, right? So sometimes you actually feel that listening to your parents is not smart but listening to your parents the Bible say is smart. Now you realize as you know people do normal observation of how children grow up in life and we use our own personal um examples that um for a son the view of the father or or his point of view of his father changes as he grows up. So you often find that they say that at two years old uh a 2-year-old will believe that daddy knows everything and by the time he's five he feels daddy knows a lot. By the time he's 10 he starts to realize that daddy doesn't know everything. At 15 daddy doesn't know anything. At 18, dad becomes old-fashioned. At 25, well, dad knows a little, but times have changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at 35, then perspective starts to change. Oh, before we decide, let's ask dad, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; At 50, what will dad have thought? Amen. &gt;&gt; Most of the time at 50 that is probably very old or that has passed. At 60 that knew everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And at 70, I wish I could talk to that &gt;&gt; one more time. &gt;&gt; That did not change. &gt;&gt; It was the point of view of that child that changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; A pastor was talking the other Wednesday about perspectives and that was so profound because I was thinking about it. If we are looking at something from different positions, we'll have a different point of views. You might have a point of view that does not adequately describe what you're looking at. It's not an illusion. You just need to change your position to a place where you have an adequate knowledge of what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; It also happens with girls. At four years old, they believe mom can do anything. At 8 years old, oh, mom knows a lot. A whole lot. At 12, they realize mom doesn't know everything. At 14, teenage. Oh, mom is so mom is so embarrassing. At [snorts] 18, mom is out of touch with reality. At 25, mom might know a few things. At 30, maybe I should call mom before I decide. At 40, how will mom handle this? At 50, I finally understand mom. At 60, mom was right about almost everything. And at 70, I wish I could talk to mom again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that our youthful years are the most critical times of our lives. God is interested in those years, but so is the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because those are the years where we become shaped. &gt;&gt; That is what determines for most people who they will become &gt;&gt; later on in life. And that's why the wisest king again says, "Remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not." Because evil days are going to come when you hardly have time for yourself. &gt;&gt; When you hardly have time for anything else. It's easier to have a better prayer life as an unmarried young person that has no responsibility, no bills to pay than when life starts to happen. &gt;&gt; And I know a lot of kids like to be adults as fast as possible, but if you have not heard the news, adulting is scam. is real scam. I want to pay my bills. I want to have my house. You know, our kids many times will have their conversations. Just reminds me of how we used to think back in the day. And oh, I want to have this. I'm like, okay, you can have it when you have your own house. I'm going to I'm going to do this. I'm going to have this. Right? You you it's natural because God has put us put something in us that desires to grow. But remember, it's not going to get easier. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the reality. &gt;&gt; It's not going to get easier. &gt;&gt; I feel like I am at what they call middle age. And I think about middle age as the peak, right? For those that don't know, I'm 45. So middle age means you can see childhood and growing up days as well as you can see growing old and that's where crisis happens because you start to see that you are now getting to the declining state of life where things start to gradually go down. You have so many years to work, yet you're looking at your mortgage and asking yourself, "When am I going to get it paid off?" You see your kids growing, but you also see your parents growing older. And if you are sincere with yourself, might not take too long for that and mom to go if they are still alive. So, it puts a lot of pressure. So the point is when you're younger, you have a huge opportunity. When you want to, if you want to pick up a skill, you can do it better when you're younger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to learn a musical instrument, you want to get into sports, you have more time when you're younger. So God is saying, "I need your youthful days." But remember, Satan is also saying, "I need your youthful days." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we can look at examples in the scriptures of young people that had to make decisions, but I want to just point us to one for the sake of time. One, let's look at the life of Esau. Now, Esau was one of the twin boys, right? It was Esau and Jacob that were born to Isaac and Rebecca. These were children that God had foretold. Rebecca knew that she had this two children coming. God had given her a foresight of who they were going to be. The the the older shall serve the younger. She she already knew that. And then this children were born. And the Bible would tell us in Genesis 25, he said, "And the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents." So they had two personalities, two different personalities. And Isaac loved Esau. And the Bible tells us why. Because he did eat of his venison. The venison was the reason why he loved him. But Rebecca loved Jacob. Bible didn't tell us why. But we know that J Rebecca had the revelation &gt;&gt; of those kids. The Lord showed it to her. And Jacob sought pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was faint. Therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy birthright." So Esau came, he was hungry, his body wanted something, &gt;&gt; right? Right? &gt;&gt; His body wanted something. &gt;&gt; He had a desire. But the problem was he did not think [snorts] before he let go was more important than the desire he had at the moment. And Isa said, "Behold, I am at the point to die. And what profit shall this birthright do me?" Now the birthright inside the birthright was the blessing. &gt;&gt; The blessing was meant for who had the birthright. Now he wasn't sincere with himself by saying that if I don't eat right now I'm going to die. Anyone ever got hungry to the point of like if I don't eat right I'm going to die. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's more of thirst. But the reality is there will be an alternative. &gt;&gt; You've got to measure it. Now, Esau, he despised the birthright. The Bible told us that he despised it. When you despise something, that means you undervalue that thing. &gt;&gt; We've heard many times the birthright today is equivalent to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, when you undervalue the Holy Ghost, you are doing exactly what Esau did. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. And many times why do we undervalue the Holy Ghost is for the things that please our flesh. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Why did I not get saved when I was 12 years old?" He said, "The devil hung over my shoulder telling me, wait a little longer. &gt;&gt; You're too young to get saved. You're too young to get the Holy Ghost. Enjoy your life just a little bit more." So, Esau made that decision because he wanted the pleasure of a moment. &gt;&gt; And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day." And he swore unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. The Bible said, "Thus Esau despised his birthright." Now we see that this problem already started from the garden of Eden. The problem of a pleasure, the pleasure of a moment of instant gratification. And that started with the first mother Eve. The Bible told us that when the serpent offered her the fruit of the tree, the Bible said, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, &gt;&gt; number one, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, number two, and a tree to be desired to make one wise." So, three things that made our fall, the lust of the eyes, &gt;&gt; the lust of the flesh, &gt;&gt; and the pride of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So good for food lost of the flesh satisfies the flesh. Pleasant to the eyes, lost of the eyes. and a tree to be desired to make one wise. The pride of life to be wiser than God. &gt;&gt; That's what this devil was selling to her. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; She didn't realize it. &gt;&gt; And many times you can think that is far off. But anytime you step over the word of God and expect a different result, the devil is trying to make you think you are wiser than God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Esau went on like that. He had dropped the birth right. He had despised it. And the Bible would tell us that when he was 40 years old, he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Barry the Heatite, and Bashmath, the daughter of Elon the Heatite. The Bible said which were a grieve of mind unto Isaac and Rebecca. &gt;&gt; So he despised the birthight which is the Holy Ghost. When he got to the point of marriage, he got it wrong. &gt;&gt; Why? Disobedience. Now, if you remember, God called Abraham out of his kindred, out of his father's land, told him to take a journey to the land of Canaan, and he said, "I'm going to give you this land." Why was God going to give Canaan to Abraham? Because the people of Canaan were evil in the eyes of the Lord. Now they came from a different lineage. If you trace it back, they came from Ham, the same man that despised his father &gt;&gt; and saw his father naked. &gt;&gt; So when it was time for Isaac to get married, Abraham will call the chief servant of his house, Eleazar, and tell Elezah to go back to his father's family. go back to Abraham's family where he came from and get a wife. Says, "Swear to me that you will not get a wife from here." &gt;&gt; That's why Elazar had to go sought for a wife from the same lineage as Abraham. Now, Esau did what was contrary to that commandment. And when he did that, he became a weariness to his parents. The Bible said they were grie they were which were a grief of mine unto Isaac and Rebecca. When you get to chapter 27, and Rebecca said to Isaac, I am weary of my life &gt;&gt; because of the daughters of those are the daughters of the the Hittites. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of such as this, which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?" So at this point we find that Jacob has already gotten the blessing by deceiving his father and Esau was going to kill Jacob. But this was the time when Rebecca was also telling Jacob to run away. But she brought a very vital reason why Jacob must not be allowed to marry from the women of the land. Now, the phrase weary of my life is an Hebrew expression of deep distress. It wasn't meaning that she wanted to kill herself. She was tired of life. That was not what it meant. But she was grieved of the possible loss of Jacob, not only physically, but spiritually if Jacob were to marry from the women of the land. Now, when this happened, we find that Esau tried to fix things. 28 Genesis 28 says, "And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Padan Aram to the house of Bethl, thy mother's father, and take the a wife from then of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people, and give thee the blessing of Abraham to thee, and to thy seed with thee, that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. And Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethwell, the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's, and Esau's mother. And when and Esau when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padanaram to take him a wife from then, and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, "Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan." and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother. &gt;&gt; See obedience there. &gt;&gt; The one who was the deceiver, the sunplanter, &gt;&gt; he had a weakness in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yet he obeyed. &gt;&gt; Because his deliverance was tied to the obedience. Boys and girls, as you grow older, you'll have your struggles. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you that everything will be fine. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you that you not do things that you know your parents have said you should not do that you're ashamed of and things like, but just continue to obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a friend that we grew up together. I like to bring his testimony. Many times when I talk about this, he's currently a pastor in the UK. This brother at some point in his life was addicted to drugs and smoking and all of that and he was we were all living in Nigeria and we all knew that he was into stuff. He was even as far as getting into diabolical stuff and he said there are times he would have smoked weed. Maybe it's a Wednesday night &gt;&gt; and he will come to church still. And he had one prayer request and that prayer request was God give me revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now God answered that prayer when he left the temp the the the tropical warm weather of Nigeria and moved to the temperate UK where he gets really cold and God delivered him from the demon of smoking. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew that the answer was in revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; The answer was in obedience. &gt;&gt; Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was going to pardon a ram. And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father. &gt;&gt; So that means that when he was going to get married, he did not even go ask his parents, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; for their opinion &gt;&gt; or for their counsel or for their guidance. He just went after his own heart &gt;&gt; just the same way he did with the birthright. Then when Esau then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had, Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Neboth, to be his wife. [snorts] Now we see three categories of women here. We see the Canaanites, right, in the land. Then we see the daughter of Ishmael. But who was the mother of Ishmael? &gt;&gt; Can remind me. &gt;&gt; Aar, right? Where was Aar from? &gt;&gt; Egypt. So Ishmael was a hybrid. &gt;&gt; Although he was the son of Abraham, but he was a hybrid. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then the sec the third category will be Abraham's family. So we have believers make believers and unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Many times we talk about how you should not marry an unbeliever. But let me also remind you there are make believers in the church. &gt;&gt; And it's as bad as marrying an unbeliever if you marry a makeeliever. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A young brother asked me a question when we were in Nigeria and said, "What do you think, brother Toby?" Brother Ram said, "Marry who believes." Marry someone that believes what you believe. We have different understandings of the message, different doctrinal differences. So who is the person that believes what you believe? So I started by telling him that that advice that brother gave is applicable not just for people in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is applicable generally when you think about marriage and what comes with it. &gt;&gt; If you're not on the same page with the person you're married to, you are setting up yourself for failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when brother said marry someone that believes what you believe, that's why there is the phase of courtship &gt;&gt; where you get to know this person, know their family, know where they came from, know what they were brought up with, know their belief system, &gt;&gt; regardless of whether they're in a message church or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then check that with what you have been taught and what you believe. &gt;&gt; And as much as possible, take counsel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take counsel. Ask questions. Go to the pastor. Let him know what you're going through. Go to your parents. Ask questions because it will be easier when the storms come. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that last year the Lord gave us a message that's we titled the definitive importance I guess of the foundation and I brought that from the parable that Jesus Christ gave of the wise men and the foolish men. Now, the wise man and the foolish man, if you read that story in Matthew, it tells you that there was a wise man that builds on the rock and then there was a foolish man that builds on the sand. And from that, if you think about it, the context will be that they built in two different locations, right? There was a location that was rock, there was another location that was sand, maybe by the seashore. But if you go to Luke chapter 6, I believe, let me see if I can find it. Otherwise, I'll just paraphrase. Luke chapter 6 explains it a different way. I won't say a different way, but just kind of throws more light to it. Luke chapter 6, I found it from verse 47. Let's read it together. Whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings endureth them. I will show you to whom he is like. It is like a man which built an house and did what? &gt;&gt; Digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this tells us is the same location. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was just dependent on how deep &gt;&gt; the duck &gt;&gt; and what does rock signify? &gt;&gt; Revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the revelation of how God intended marriage to be and how it should be approached is what differentiates the person who lays his marriage on the right foundation and the person who does not do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The person that says I don't have to listen to the counsel of my parents. I don't have to listen to the counsel of the word of God. This is too easy that they are making it. This is much more easier than they're making it. I can make this happen. I love this person and I'm going to go ahead. The Bible said the person is not digging deep enough. &gt;&gt; When the floods arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation without a revelation, &gt;&gt; right? Built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the rain of that house was great. The ram told us as children to honor our parents while we have them because here we have no continuing city. &gt;&gt; He was given his own life story and in the message here we have no continuing city. He said, "And young people, remember if you are fortunate enough today to have a daddy and a mother living, love them. Honor them." &gt;&gt; The hour will come when you'll think that they are the greatest people in the world. &gt;&gt; If you don't now, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; There's a face in your life where your parents actually don't mean a lot to you because they're just those old folks. I went through it as well. &gt;&gt; But my testimony is not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm at the point where I don't think I want to do anything major without asking dad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because now I can see the wisdom &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that he has &gt;&gt; which some time ago I despised. But Rama said and some of this he said the hour we come where you think that they're the greatest people in the world if you don't now and don't never little fellows don't never give the slandering word &gt;&gt; old man and old woman that's not the old man and old woman that's daddy and mother &gt;&gt; in the time of Abraham that was the slandering words that was used for parents I don't know what's used today. But if the word is a slandering word, &gt;&gt; don't use it on your parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't take from what your classmates will do when they look down on their parents and just find some nicknames for their parents or some slandering words for their parents. Don't do that. But the Ram said that is daddy and mother. And some of these days when they go out of the room in the casket of flowers, you hear them lowered down in the ground. The pastors say ashes to ashes and dust. It won't be the old man then. The old woman, it'll be mother. You'll be ringing your hands and crying. Said, "That's right. Now, while she's leaving, give her her flowers now. &gt;&gt; And give daddy's flowers. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the best flower you could give them is obey them. &gt;&gt; The best flower you could give is obey them. &gt;&gt; Even when their ideas look old-fashioned, still obey them. Even when you think they've not connected with the reality of the Gen Z's and the Gen Alphas, still obey them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible told us there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We thought a lot of things were new when we're growing up, but as you grow older, you realize actually there's nothing new. &gt;&gt; Amen. the advice that you that that you you you you did not take from your parents as an older person, you realize that that was to my heart. I wish I listened. &gt;&gt; And that's the first promise in the Bible. The first commandment with promise, honor thy father and mother, which may lengthen the days upon the earth that the Lord giveth thee. Now we talked about the challenge with obeying. The Bible made us to know that it's one of the spirits of the age. Paul was writing to Timothy. He said, "This also know that in the last days times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud blasphemers, disobedient to parents." So it's something that you have to fight. &gt;&gt; Now anytime we are tempted the location of the beginning of that temptation is our minds. That's why brother Brown preached the message the greatest battle ever fought. And he said the location of that battle is in the mind. James was telling us that said, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, &gt;&gt; which the Lord had promised to them that love him." Let no man say, "When he is tempted, I'm tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempted he any man." Let me just explain that very, very quickly. So he said, "The man that endureth temptation," and then he used another word. He said when he is tried, &gt;&gt; he shall receive the crown of life. So it's the same event, but where it's coming from is different. &gt;&gt; God will allow the devil to tempt you. And that temptation becomes a trial. &gt;&gt; Now this is how you differentiate the weakness. The the the difference. The difference is based on the intent of where it's coming from. When Satan is tempting you, he wants you to fall. &gt;&gt; When God is trying you, God is putting you in the test with the notion that you are going to pass the test. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he knows that he has trained you well enough. &gt;&gt; Remember the cheater, the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; he's trained you well enough. He's giving you enough lessons to know that in this situation now, you got to calm down. But God inspired that person to speak rudely to you. &gt;&gt; Well, not God inspiring the person. God allowed the devil to inspire the person &gt;&gt; because there's no evil that comes from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. So God allows the devil just like the lying spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Barry preached about it. The lying spirit had to come from where? From hell. Came into the presence of God. God had an assignment and God had to give it to the lying spirits to go do so that God's word can be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So he's telling us here James that you cannot say God tempted me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now this is how temptation happens. &gt;&gt; He said but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed. &gt;&gt; It starts with that desire to have something. said, "Then when lust has conceived, it bringeth forth sin and sin. When it's finished, bringeth forth death." Let me read that in the amplified version. He said, "But each one is tempted when he's dragged away, enticed." When someone is enticing you, it's not actually what you want to do, &gt;&gt; but the person is jingling a reward that you hardly can say no to. &gt;&gt; Look at this. This looks so nice. This is chocolate. You can't say no. And that's what the devil does, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It will bring it right before your face, tell you the benefit of it. Your entire body is saying, "Yes, I want. Yes, I want. Yes, I want." But then it's not good for you. That's &gt;&gt; right. So he's telling us that when you are dragged away and enticed and baited to commit sin by your own worldly desire, the Adamic nature in you. So then when the illicit desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin and when sin runs its curse, it gives birth to death. Now, we've said all of these things, but I want to use the same words in closing. Yes, it's 5 minutes past 12. I'm closing. That Paul used in Hebrews when he said, "But beloved, we're persuaded better things of you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have brought this warning. We have brought the reminder &gt;&gt; that God expects us to obey the first commandment with promise which is obeying our parents. God has been kind enough to give us godly parents. And we can have enough confidence not in them but in God that God had given them those responsibilities to train us up to diligently teach us the word of God and to provide for us that God will give them all they require to do that. Will our parents make mistakes? Yes, they will sometimes. But God will take care of it. All that God is looking for is for you to obey. Now, Brother Abraham told us, and I want you to always remember this regardless of what Satan tells you. Brother Abraham told us that you kids are the best kids in the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me read that to you. &gt;&gt; He said, "I said to Brother Fred, his kids, why? They can just hear me say one thing that's wrong. They're ready to stop it right now, you see, and set with the highest respect instead of being a hot roden rambling around. When they hear you speak about the gospel, they are ready to sit right there and listen. &gt;&gt; You kids come to church with your parents knowing that you'll have to sit down maybe for an hour or two to listen to the word of God, and you still come. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "Now I know we all want our kids is renegades and things like that, but we must stop that." Speaking to the parents, I believe that we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world because they are our children and we claim them for God. [applause] &gt;&gt; They're the best children. &gt;&gt; You are the best children. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might have your troubles. You might have difficulties. You might have things you're struggling with. &gt;&gt; But never let the devil tell you &gt;&gt; anything different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Each one of you as babies or as toddlers were brought forward and prayed for, &gt;&gt; dedicated to the Lord, &gt;&gt; initiated into his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Though futuristic, but that sea germ that is inside of you, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit is watching over it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, he will fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you go through, you just obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just obey. It might not make sense. It might not line up with what your friends are doing, what is in vogue, and things like that. You just obey. The Lord will lead you and you will have a wonderful life. &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians. Let's be on our feet. I want us to sing the song as I invite the pastor. Where he leads me, I will follow. I'll go with him all the way. God wants us to do that as his children. Whether we adults or children, God wants us to follow him. I think it's is a different song. I can hear my savior calling. Thank you. That's the right one. I can hear [singing] my savior [music] calling. I can hear my savior calling. I can hear [music] [singing] my savior calling. What did he [music] say? Just take thy cross and follow for [singing] me. [music] Do you want to make the promise to him this afternoon? Where he [music] leads me, I will follow. [music] He [singing] leads me. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] I go far. [music and singing] I'll go with you. I'll go with you. with [music] him all [singing] the way. &gt;&gt; I'll go with him through the garden. I [music] go [singing] with him through the garden. [music] I'll [singing] go in truth. [music] the [singing] dark. I'll go with [music] him through [singing] God. [music] I'll go with thee. I'll go with you. [music] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse three now. I'll go with him through the judgment [singing] of [music] the world. I'll go with you and I'll go [music and singing] with you through the judgement over [music] [singing] [music] the judge. Will you go with me? I'll [music] go away [singing] through the judgement. [music] I'll go with you. I'll go with [singing] you. [music] With [singing] [music] verse four, he will give me grace and glory. Does that make you happy? He will give [music] me praise [singing] and glory. [music] Yes, he will. He will. Just trust and obey. [music] &gt;&gt; He will give you grace and glory. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Give me grace [music] and glory and go with [singing] you. Yes. [music] And go with me. Oh, [music] [singing] grace now. Follow me as I call. Oh, [music and singing] he is willing. [music and singing] [music and singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Follow [music] me. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that [music] this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to hear how the word of God works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, speaking [music] directly to the children, &gt;&gt; but let's not take it and shovel it off on the children &gt;&gt; because we're all children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just couldn't help but think about it. You know, how parents, even when we're adults, we can look at [music] our parents and and see that they make mistakes. But that doesn't change who they are. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't change the value of them. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing with [music] the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the message in itself has no flaws. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Humans [music] have flaws. And you know what's happened in the day in which we live [music] is many different versions have been preached of what we would consider to be the message. [music] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change the fact that there is a truth in this message. &gt;&gt; And that truth is what will make us free. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To this age. [music] But many times we can look at it and say well you know this person they represented it this way and this person they represented it that way. Therefore I have liberty now [music] to disobey. When do children have the liberty to disobey the parents? &gt;&gt; Never. There's no liberty. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. It's powerful. I feel inspired. I could preach on this for a long time. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only fault with people who have misrepresented this message. &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's so good because it's where I find all of my comfort and strength about this message is just say what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; And I love what he said today about the children. The children that we have, they're the best children. &gt;&gt; And you know, the devil can't have them. &gt;&gt; We claim every single one of them in the name of Jesus Christ for the kingdom. [applause] They might not look like it. They might not sound like it, but that's got nothing to do with it. You know, my dad always told me that I was never as far from God as I thought. And if you're watching right now, I love you, Dad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said that. And you know what, brother Toby said right at the end here is so true because I know even though I was I was dedicated in the Pentecostal church, I was not dedicated to the Pentecostal church. &gt;&gt; I was dedicated to God. as a baby. &gt;&gt; And every single one of us that is dedicated, we're dedicated to God. &gt;&gt; Who knows how he works? &gt;&gt; He's a wonderworking God. He's magnificent, isn't he? &gt;&gt; My goodness. Let's let's just bow in prayer as we close. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for your goodness, Lord. We thank you for your your [music] tender mercies to each and every one of us, Lord. Father, we pray that you would help us, Father, to recognize the only success we're going to have is to follow your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not grievious to serve you, Lord. Oh, Father, you said that my yoke is easy and my burden is light. &gt;&gt; Father, when we live in this world thinking that we're going to do it our way, &gt;&gt; it becomes so difficult. But when we finally lay down our own will and surrender to you and your word, &gt;&gt; oh father, something supernatural takes place. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord, &gt;&gt; we're so thankful for your goodness, Lord. Thank you for the word today. Thank you for brother Toby and his family, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for the representation they have. We thank you that they had parents, Lord, that trained them up in the way they should go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, and here he is now giving credit [music] to his dad who raised him in your ways &gt;&gt; and his mom. Father, we pray that you would bless Brother Toby. &gt;&gt; We know the devil doesn't like this kind of talk, so he's not going to let it go easy. But Lord, we we [music] so thank you. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways. Lord, thank you for the many, many testimonies we heard about this morning. You are the same today that you were before and that you will be in the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; We know that your word is just as enforced today as the the day that it was written, the day that it was thought in your mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Father, today we are here as living witnesses that [music] your word is alive. &gt;&gt; We just pray that you would be glorified now, Father, as we go our separate ways. Keep your hand upon each one of us. be with those [music] who couldn't make it today, wherever they are, Father. Maybe some are hurting. Maybe some are lost. Maybe some are just disillusioned. Maybe some haven't just heard it the right way. But we pray, Father, for each and every one that you would minister to to them sovereignly, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And help us, Lord, to find that last predestinated seed in the city of Calgary. [music] We pray that you would give us that burden, Lord, in our hearts that we would desire to find that person whether it's at work or at school, oh father, in the shopping center, wherever we are, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that we could just bring more to your kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song, Hosana? I just couldn't help but think about that. Blessed be the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the rock, not of our or their but my salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh [singing] magnify. &gt;&gt; Let's do [music] the verse.

I'm not going to keep us too long. &gt;&gt; Just remember that you're God's attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put it on, brother Brandham. Don't put it somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Take it the way it's written. [music] It's beautiful. God's attributes were manifested [singing] to his bride in this last age.
