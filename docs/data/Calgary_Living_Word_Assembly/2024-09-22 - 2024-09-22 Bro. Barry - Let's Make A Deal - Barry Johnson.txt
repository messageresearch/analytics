prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord that while we stand here on this Earth Lord knowing that it's in the shifting Sands of Time time father everything is changing around us Lord you never change father we thank you that we can depend on that Lord we're so thankful that you've given us your rock of Revelation your word Lord Jesus and father the ability to hear it in the day in which we live father we just ask Lord that you would meet each need made known unto you today by way of an uplift hand father and Lord if there's a need that wasn't made known unto you physically Lord we know that you know mentally father we know more than anything that you know spiritually we just want to commit each and every need into your hands father and Lord we'll be careful to give you the praise and the glory for answering those prayers Lord father as we've said in the past we'll say it again today Lord Jesus let us not be like the other nine lepers father that were healed of their unbelief that Lord just turned and ran and celebrated and reveled in what you did for them but never once took the time to turn back to you and say thank you Lord for what you've done oh Father give us strength in the day in which we live father we pray that you would just bear us up on the wings of an eagle father we thank you for your tender loving kindness to each and every one of us Lord we know that you're more than willing more than able to meet each need as we commit them into your hand hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians certainly appreciate each one continually bringing of their gifts offering them as a free will offering certainly does something for the service to have musicians so talented if you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read from 2 Kings chapter 20 a familiar story just an inspiration that I believe the lord gave me and we'll just certainly trust him second Kings chapter 20 a story not the story but a story amen about King Hezekiah amen it's probably one of the most most famous stories of Hezekiah chapter 20 verse1 and second Kings says in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said unto him thus saith the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass at four Isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard heard thy prayer amen I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word thank you that you are the faithful one thank you that you are unchanging Lord father we just pray that you would take this word that was spoken that was written that was inspired father that you would take it and just break it open to us fresh once again father I know your children have come hungry and father Lord I pray that I could just get out of the way father and that you would just have the preeminence Lord that you would just speak to all of us this morning Father and Lord that we would have hearts to receive what you have to say we love you and we thank you we just commit all the rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just can't get in his presence and not get emotional I think it's just wonderful just a few announcements before we get started here we have a communion service tonight at 5:30 p.m. just a wonderful opportunity to get together and uh discern the Lord's body just thank him for what he's done for each and every one of us we have an opportunity to partake of the communion table um as well as give a testimony for what the Lord's doing and it's a wonderful thing when we can give a testimony for what the Lord's doing whether it's seemingly great or whether it's seemingly small if the Lord's doing it it's perfect and uh it's just a wonderful time in the Lord so service tonight at 5:30 p.m. the communion service we haven't had one for a few months kind of took the summer off and uh I hope it's okay we have uh brother isacson coming here on uh the 25th on Wednesday from from Ghana he'll be here and uh he I think has a a Ministry that he's been ministering over western Canada he was with the Saints in Manitoba and I don't think he's been in Saskatchewan but I know he's heading to Edmonton as well so I spoke to brother Ed hammermeister and we coordinated a little bit of a schedule brother Ed did coordinated a bit of a schedule uh for his Alberta visit and uh our lot landed with the 25th so he'll be coming here and uh we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has put on his heart we have uh October 1st we'll be going forwards with the church officer officers vote and uh it'll be the same thing that we've done in the past it will be uh by proxy so it will be an email and you can just answer the questionnaire either yes or no to each one brother mvin Panetta as the treasurer brother Paul clawen as a trustee brother Henry dick as a trustee brother Emanuel sarpong as a deacon Brother Don snow as a deacon brother Peter Boi Manu as a deacon brother Toby odoo has decided to step back from his duties of Deacon to pursue his ministry and uh he's been promoted to minister this gospel in many different places and the Lord has really blessed his ministry and we certainly want to encourage him in his leadership of the Lord so he has felt like he just hasn't been able to be strong in his position as a deacon here and it's really kind of bothered him and I don't think anyone has had issue with it at all understanding that he's been putting his shoulder to the wheel in a really strong way with the Saints in Lethbridge helping that church become established and rooted and grounded in the word and uh so he's really made a lot of efforts him and brother Gilbert to actually establish that that church and you know the church in Lethbridge has really come a long ways and I can tell you that myself I could never do what those two brothers have done there and that's the leadership of the Lord in their lives and I think it's well worth celebrating I think it's well worth congratulating them and uh you know the labor of love that they have for the Saints to see the gospel spread and to see a church established in Lethbridge I think that's nothing short of the leadership of the Lord in our brother's lives and you know they haven't been around many times and maybe we've wondered why they haven't been here it's not because they've stopped coming here it's because they're working to establish the church in Lethbridge and I know brother Jose he has been integral with what's happened in Lethbridge he carried the ball for a while down there and really labored and we certainly thank brother Jose for his efforts and uh you know it's a many membered body that makes things happen so brother Toby has decided to step back from um Deacon duties and he actually reminded me of it that he he spoke to me two years ago and said I don't know how long I'll be able to actually uphold this position because he knew he was going to travel and Minister and I just think it's wonderful to see the leadership of the Lord and so that is what we'll be voting on uh brother Toby will stay on he said until the end of the year so I don't think there's really a need to vote for him unless somebody has a an issue with him come and see me directly but I don't think we'll put him on the ballot I don't think there's any need for it um so if anybody has a leadership from the Lord where they would like to stand in the capacity of a deacon I want to call upon you now and say if that's what you feel led to do and you qualify there's very specific qualifications in the word and I think it's well worth going over we can certainly talk about that but if you have a leadership from the Lord to serve in that capacity we certainly do need someone um to actually help so we'll be going forward with a vote uh look for that it will be open from the 1st of October until the 4th of October it's not going to be very long so you'll have to watch for that and then just take your opportunity to vote and we'll go forwards from there on October the 12th we have the Men's breakfast we've been invited to in Edmonton and uh I think we're going to have I think it's brother Alistair from South Africa and uh and brother uh Matthew Watkins from uh North Carolina North no I'm getting it wrong South Carolina so I think that'll be a wonderful time as well there's been a tremendous response too from the brothers and uh I think it'll just be a wonderful time in the Lord and you know it's a bit of a sacrifice to go and do that and uh you know just come back but we know that uh through sacrifice there's gain so uh we also have the youth event coming up on the 20th I think it is is that right the 20th of October it's the weekend yeah that's what I thought so we certainly look forward to that as well are you happy this morning it's nice to see the weather changing see the snow dust the mountains and feel the little teeny bit of cool air fortunately it hasn't been really cold we haven't had a hard Frost yet which is a real blessing from the Lord I'm certainly thankful for that but we uh we'll just see what the Lord has in store it's been a a wonderful year and we're certainly excited to to see what the Lord has in store uh for anyone that might be wondering uh there's been a little bit of Buzz I guess a little bit of discussion uh we're going to be putting a monitor up on the back wall here um and I apologize um to everyone I'm terrible when it comes to communication and I know some folks have had questions about things um maybe what I'll try and do is just overc communicate a littleit bit what I would feel might be overc communicating a little bit so and you know if you do have any questions please by all means feel free to reach out to me directly I don't bite in fact I I really think a lot of confusion can be eliminated if somebody has a question if we could just have a conversation there's nothing wrong with talking to the pastor and a pastor that won't receive a conversation is actually got something wrong with him because he's there for a purpose and that's to help people so um anyways all that to say we're going to be putting a monitor up on the back wall it's going to hang from the ceiling and it's going to help those people who are leading songs here uh we'll be able to see the words up there and we won't have to try and look around the reflection of the lights on the screen here and so on so um if you see something different back there that's what's happening it's just so we can actually see a little easier God bless you this morning today I want to talk about a little bit about uh Hezekiah the story of Hezekiah and how he was the King and uh the king of Judah and just to see how the Lord really blessed him in his life and uh if I had to make a title for today's sermon it just hit me that uh I I'm I'm going to call it this and I might actually take a little bit of a series on this we'll see what the Lord has in store but let's make a deal let's make a deal and you know that's what the devil wants to do the devil wants to make a deal and we're going to talk about this now in uh I think a bit of detail here as we go forwards but we know that Hezekiah he was struck with an illness and uh he prayed and isn't it wonderful to see in second Kings chapter 20 verse 5 the prophet of God who had gone into him and was told by God to pronounce to him put your house in order because your house maybe is a little a little bit out of order and you're going to die in your flesh you're going to actually go to where your fathers were buried and you're going to now die and and then because of his prayer is kind of what I'm I'm so inspired by because of this man's prayer God turned his Prophet around and sent him back before he even left the premises and he said to him I've heard your your prayer has come to my ear and I have also seen your tears I understand that you're not ready to die you don't want to die so that's okay you know what because I I know I know who you are and I know how you love me I am prepared to give you 15 additional years I think it's just wonderful if you listen to the message I've got a bunch of quotes that I'm going to be uh pulling for from today and and you don't have to bring any of them up just yet brother but it's out of uh does god um I just have to look it up because I'm going to get it wrong God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him I think it's just a beautiful message if you listen to that message brother Bram he talks about this and and he says here we have Hezekiah the king a human being remember he's a human being he's in flesh he's a man of like passions and and probably struggles maybe even a little more than many people because anything he wants he's got because he's the king he just has to go like that right or maybe it's like that that's what I want and and he can have it but here he's got something now that's beyond his control and he takes it to the Lord but the way he brings it to the Lord brothers and sisters is I think so significant he says I beseech thee Oh Lord verse 3 of 20 remember how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart yes sir now who on Earth has a perfect heart we know that David he was a man after God's Own Heart wasn't he and why was he the prophet of God said he was a man after God's Own Heart because he was quick to repent he wasn't interested in dragging around balls and chains he wasn't interested in in in in in the garbage from the past he wasn't even interested in making a deal with the devil he knew that the devil came around and tempted him but he never one time said it's all the devil's fault David said oh lord it's my fault and he went on his face himself to repent for his sin but here we have this King now death is brought to his doorstep you you are sick you're up on your bed and you're not coming down buddy get your house in order write out a will make sure that everybody knows what's going to happen when you die plan your funeral make sure everything is in order because now that's it's beyond your control even though you're a king you can't stop this what's coming to pass but my to be able to look to the Lord how many of us this morning can look to the Lord with confidence in your hearts I'm not looking for a hand I'm just trying to stimulate our hearts this is is really I guess the heart purpose of what I felt for today how many of us can say that we've walked before the Lord with a perfect heart I don't think it depends necessarily on how we walk every single day of Our Lives even though it does I think more than anything it depends on how willing we are to subject ourselves to the word of God and repent because the Zeal of the age is to repent it's not to say that everything is fine and live a different life behind the scenes that is not a Christian walk but here this king is saying remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight I say Lord help me to do that which is good in your sight why you know looking at this King how could he have that confidence let's just back up a little bit let's turn the page back a little bit in uh in Second Kings if you just turn back to 2 Kings chapter 18 2 Kings chapter 18 now it came to pass in the third year o of hos son of ela king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of ahaz King of Judah began to Reign 2 and5 years old was he when he began to Reign and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his mother 's name was also Abby the daughter of Zachariah and here's the key to it right here verse three and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his father did what did he do that was right in the sight of the Lord you ask verse four he removed the high places break the images cut down the Groves break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made now when I read this I thought wow he broke the Brazen serpent wouldn't that be a sacred artifact it truly would be wouldn't it because God told them if you look at this thing you'll live when the serpents come through and bite you for murmuring cuz that's what it was about when you look upon this Brazen serpent you'll live now here we have this King that had a perfect heart that walked perfectly before the Lord he smashes this this sacred artifact this is why For unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and called it and he called it n hushan why did he break it because they took this thing that God gave them and they perverted it brothers and sisters if we're not careful we can take this thing that God's given us and pervert it and the devil loves that the devil loves to get right in that thing that God has given us and get us to pervert it right and all the while we'll think we're doing right while we're burning incense to the serpent but thanks be to God for a king that would have the desire in his heart to not do what his fathers did to not look around and say I don't need to be like the people of the land we don't need to be like the amorites or the parasites or the kenites or the moabites we don't have to be like any of the IES all we need to do is serve the Lord follow the lord holy Hallelujah I think there's a critical key here brothers and sisters and I'm going to harp on it for a little bit he removed the high places and break the images I believe there comes a point in time in a believer's life where we need to examine all of the artifacts that we've got going on in our Christian walk all of our belief structures everything that that that gives us this idea this ideology that we're a Believer what is it that surrounds us is it truly just the word of God or do we have a little bit of a high place something that we just keep there it's just it's just tradition it's just what we've done so we're just going to keep that there and we'll just continue on with the Lord it'll be okay a grove Grove a nice beautiful garden a nice surrounding area of trees where you can go and prostrate yourself before your God do we have any of that is there anything in our lives that comes before the word of God that we're willing to actually say you know I I know the Lord's just calling me in my heart he's in my heart and he's speaking to me and he's telling me I don't like you doing this thing I I want you to stop whatever it is you're doing but I just can't seem to do it and and and I just don't know how I'm ever going to get over it and maybe what I need to do is just reside to the fact that you know maybe it's genetics maybe it's actually a curse from the past maybe it's my for for fathers maybe there's a grandpa or a grandma or something in my life's history that just had this thing and now it's just come down to the generations we're living in an age brothers and sisters with the culmination of all the devils in Earth but we're also living under the Full Gospel Light of the Lord Jesus Christ we don't have to make a deal with the devil and say no no it's a genetic curse it's it's something from the past and I can just make make an excuse for it and say I I just need to accept it I just have this thing whatever it is the devil loves to make a deal he's just agonizing pining for us to say yeah just accept it it's okay you can't help it you don't have to worry about it you just keep going forward just keep marching forward and going to church brothers and sisters keep marching forward and going to church is right that's what the prophet said that's what the word of God says forsake not the assembling of yourselves even more so as you see the day approaching and be willing to exhort one another encouraging one another what I'm getting at today is we don't have to make excuses we don't have to make a deal with the devil because when we say that I've got this thing in my life and I'm just going to make an excuse for it we're making a deal with the devil Hezekiah never made a deal Hezekiah brought his case to the Lord he didn't say okay I'm going to die that's okay now I I know some people are probably saying but brother Barry you know brother bam in this message does God ever change his mind about his word he says very specifically his first word is his only word that's it and Hezekiah changed the mind of God to give him 15 years instead of taking his life right then you know one day or other sooner or later we all have to perish in this flesh we all have to give up the ghost whether we go in the Rapture or whether we go in the grave this flesh is corrupt we can't hang on to this flesh but brother bradam he says the problem with this is that even though God gave him 15 years he corrupted himself he went from walking with a perfect heart to being puffed up with pride and it says in the word of God that God stepped back from him and said I just want to see what he'll do now and what did he do he got puffed up with his riches he brought the the friends in from Babylon and he had a little party and he showed them all of the wealth and the treasury he showed them all of his treasures in the treasure room he showed them all of the spices in in the pantry he showed him everything there and the Prophet even came to him and said what did you do what did you do were you bragging were you showing everyone how good you are don't you know that's only because God has blessed you in your life that you're here just because we ask for something doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be for our good brothers and sisters we need to seek it very carefully what we're asking the Lord for but I think it's interesting to look at the past of Hezekiah and to see how he could have such confidence in his prayer to say don't you remember Lord how I walked with you before you with a perfect heart he trusted the Lord God of Israel verse five so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah nor any that were before him that's quite a king says for he clave to the Lord and departed not from following him but kept his Commandments What Commandments Not Just the Ten Commandments but all the Commandments amen and the Commandments which the Lord commanded Moses and who was Moses Moses was the prophet Moses brought the word for the day and you know if we want to walk with a perfect perfect heart brothers and sisters we just need to follow the word of the Prophet we just need to follow the word of God for our day but you know what happened was in in hezekiah's life he had a challenge and you know brothers and sisters when we get ourselves into the position where we are in the channel where the Lord wants us to be the devil don't like that none not one bit so what's he going to do he's going to come guns blazing he's going to come after us and he's going to try everything in his Arsenal to try and get us and and I just think it's interesting you know how you you look at the life of Hezekiah if you go further in in chapter 18 over into 19 and maybe if we just look at uh verse 12 maybe 11 and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel into Assyria and put them in halah and into h by the river Goan and in the cities of the mes because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord there God but transgressed his Covenant in all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them now in the 14th year of King Hezekiah did Senate cherub king of Assyria come up against all the fence cities of Judah and took them and Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria tashas saying I I have offended return from me that which thou put us on me and I bear and the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah 300 talant of silver and 30 talant of gold so he he says I think I've offended you what can I do to make this right and the King says to him I'll tell what you can do I'll tell you what you can do to make this right let's make a deal right verse 15 says and Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord that wasn't even his silver but that's what the devil's coming for brothers and sisters all that's not even his right and in the Treasures of the King's house and at that time did Hezekiah this is where it gets really hard if we're not careful as Believers we can find ourselves doing this trying to make a deal with the devil just to get him to go away at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the Temple of the Lord and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and gave it to who to the king of Assyria the devil's going to come around and try and strip our worship he's going to come around and try and strip our ability to feed upon the word he's going to come around and try and strip our ability to have a solid marriage to have a solid relationship with our children to have overcoming power in our lives he's going to come around and try and strip that gold from our Temple we don't have to make a deal with them right we don't have to say okay I I'll just give you this because remember what what is the saying if you give an inch they're going to take a mile and that's what the devil's going to do he's going to try and take way more than we're willing to give verse 17 says and the king of Assyria sent to Tartan and and to this guy's a bad guy RAB zeras and to rashaka from Lees to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem and they went up and came to Jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the Fuller's field and when they had called out to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hila which is over the household of she shebna The Scribe and Jonah the son of Assaf and the recorder Assaf the recorder and RAB Sheeka said unto them speak ye now to Hezekiah and and this should have been the very first indicator right here and I'm sure it was in the ears of Hezekiah thus saith who the great king who is this great king thus saith the great king of Assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trust us thou sayest but they are but vain words I have counsel and strength for the war now on whom Dost thou trust that thou rebelles against me here we have a giant standing in the valley boasting out his commands boasting out just like Goliath and the whole entire Israeli Army standing there with their knees knocking and all afraid even the king afraid to go down and face this giant but one little Ruddy man is all that God needed just one little runt right the one that didn't even his father didn't even think he qualified and Samuel came to his house and said show me your sons because one of them is going to be anointed today to be king of Israel amen even his dad didn't have confidence in him but God who is rich in Mercy put something in the heart of that boy David that Shepherd boy and when he heard this he said are you serious the whole host of Israel is making a deal with the devil oh yes don't you realize this is our land he he's standing in our land this is our property we've got the title deed to it and we're going to let him do that oh and and they and they said oh okay okay okay if you want to do it you can do it our way isn't that interesting yeah yeah let's play politics now let's get political and say oh God's got a revelation in your heart now if you want to do what God's put in your heart just do it the way that we say take the king's armor and we know that David said I can't do that just take it off it weighs tooo much I'm not I'm not made that way I've got an experience where I met a lion myself and I never made a deal with that lion and I met a bear myself and I never made a deal with that bear and I know the same God of Israel is with me right now and that devil down there in the valley boasting doesn't stand a chance that's right and when he went down there what did he do brothers and sisters he didn't go down there with just a little bit of confidence where he was a shy Ruddy little boy he says in the word that he ran to the battle he ran to it because he knew exactly where he stood he was not interested in what everyone else was interested in let's make a deal no deal This Is Our Land this is our promised land and I want to say today brothers and sisters this is no time to make a deal with the devil we have been given a Promised Land that's Jesus Christ saying yesterday today and forever through the message of a Vindicated Prophet let's take our [Applause] land we don't have to make excuses if there's people murmuring let them murmur God hates it and he hears it yes he does don't make a deal with the devil Hallelujah you know talking about the same story here in 2 Chronicles chap 32 vers 7 it says be strong and courageous amen this is what the King was now saying this one who had a perfect heart walking before the Lord he knew where he stood King Hezekiah was going to his generals was going to the armies and saying to them be strong and courageous Be not Afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria remember the cities were under siege right right they had a host of army they had a lot of of people there A lot of soldiers Be not Afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with usj than with him does that sound familiar Lord open that boy's eyes and what happened we know there was Chariots of Fire and hosts of angels same thing Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there is more with us than there is of these Devils that are boasting and let me tell you these devils are boasting in our midst they're boasting in our families they're boasting in our congregation amen but we don't need to make a deal with them in fact I'm not going to make a deal with them I simply refuse to make a deal with them because I know that he called me and I know where I stand and I'm going to give it to him to say let's have a showdown this is God's work it's not mine and it's not yours it's up to him verse 8 of 32 it says with him is an arm of Flesh this is the king of Assyria Sienna cherub this really strong guy with all the host of the armies with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord Our God to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of Ziah the king of Judah this guy Hezekiah he had an experience with the Lord and you know brothers and sisters I want to encourage us if we're going through a battle if we're going through a giant in our land trying to boast against us in any way from us living in peace in our Promised Land you don't have to accept it have you ever had an experience with the Lord amen have we ever seen him come on the scene when there's no hope when there's no way out when there's no way in the world we can make a change that's exactly where God loves to see us get amen and that was exactly what he wanted to see with the king of Assyria coming up against Hezekiah it was no accident that the king of Syria he wanted to come up against Hezekiah it was no accident that their whole city was under siege it was no accident this was God testing to prove who his son was amen this guy coming around saying thus say the great king the king of Assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trust us my if you've ever had an experience you can have confidence amen you can have confidence you don't have to look at David and say only David can have that kind of of faith and maybe only brother brandham can have that kind of Faith brothers and sisters they've both passed on if someone doesn't pick up that level of Faith then all that they have done is in vain that's right there has to be someone that says I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them God has called me and I know where I stand amen Hezekiah had an experience with the Lord and I believe today that we've had experiences and that's why I'm I'm preaching and harping today brothers and sisters because I want to say if we have had an experience just dig find that experience and say Lord remind me of that experience bring it back to me show me the joy of my salvation show me the strength of that kind of faith in my life because I know that you're God the devil's going to come around and say no everything's wrong nope everything's out of order nope it shouldn't be this way nope it shouldn't be that way no no no no no who are you putting your confidence in put your confidence in me and you know verse 25 this is beautiful this is beautiful this is where I think we need to really just remember verse 25 it says am I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it the king of Assyria his messenger is saying it to to Hezekiah now he's talking about the Lord yeah yeah and he goes on to say the Lord said to me oh which one go up against this land and destroy it Lord I I'll say it this way I would say the Lord of hosts remember the story of the Prophet Micaiah how how how he was brought up into the heavenly host and he was told he was shown the Lord sitting on his throne and he said who's going to get my will my word to come to pass in ahab's life H and we know a few mingled around but one came and said I'll go down I'll go I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of all the prophets amen there's no doubt in my mind the Lord said to him go up go up and you'll be able to destroy him just just carrying on further in in Second Kings verse chapter 18 it it's terrible the way this guy boasted and and I know we're in a mixed audience it's the word of God I'm just going to say it I wasn't going to but I think I should verse 27 said this bad guy remember RAB shakah he said unto them here my master sent me to speak to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you this is what this King thought about these people this is what the devil thinks of you this is what the devil thinks of me yes he has zero respect for us brothers and sisters he wants to destroy us he doesn't want us to just make a deal by making a deal we open the door for Destruction amen amen yes sir then RAB Sheeka stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language I didn't read it but if you want to go back and read the whole story they said please don't talk in in in our language just speak to us in Syrian because we the elders can understand let's not get everyone else upset they they asked him to do that and that's just the devil you can say let's make a deal just please don't talk in that language I don't want to get the family upset and the devil's going to say all right I know exactly what to do I am going to cry with a loud voice in that language and spake again saying hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria the great king the king of Assyria thus saith the king let not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand and he is right right wasn't he right amen the devil brings truth yes he's not afraid to actually bring truth brothers and sisters there's no way Hezekiah could have done it verse 30 neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord uh oh now he's going too far sir now he's going too far he's stepping over that line yes sir saying the Lord will surely Deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria hearken not he just works on them and works on them and works on them hearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria can you believe this make an agreement with me let's make a deal don't listen to him don't listen to the leadership just forget about it let's make a deal listen to me I've got something for you to hear let's just make a deal right make an agreement with me by a present H we'll have a token right and and we'll all be happy we we'll we'll make an an agreement we'll come to a an arrangement here and he says come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own Vine and everyone of his own fig tree and drink ye every one the Waters of his sister this is the king of Assyria is speaking here the great King right yeah yeah until I come and take you away to a land like your own land why would they want to go to a land like their own land it's kind of like Eve in the garden you'll you'll be as gods they were God of the earth amen until I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and Vineyards a land of oil and olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and he just reinforces it he underpins it here the devil speaking hearken not unto Hezekiah when he persuaded you saying the Lord will deliver us can you believe this guy boasting his way around trying to get everyone on side with him to say just forget about it don't listen to them look at the circumstances look at all the natural circum isn't it obvious can't you see the Army surrounding can't you see all the natural circumstances of course it can't turn out right listen to my voice don't listen to him he's saying that God is going to deliver what God he says and and you know this king of Assyria he goes on to talk about it uh I'm oh in in verse 34 where are the gods of harath and arpad where are the gods of sephar vam and and Hina and of IA have they delivered Samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of the countries that they have delivered their country out of mine hand that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand now this is a beautiful part we read it out of out of uh 2 Chronicles it doesn't actually say it here specifically like it did in 2 Chronicles but verse 36 but the people held their peace amen and answered him not a word I believe that's a critical Factor key brothers and sisters when the Devil comes around and boast just hold your peace amen don't even say a word to him don't even give him a word just do the opposite that's all just do the opposite for the king's commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilka which was over the household and shebna the scribe and Jonah the son of Asaf the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of this bad guy RAB Shaka verse n Chapter 19 Verse one I I just think it's so beautiful this is where we see this man we see this this one excuse me that was walking perfectly before the Lord he knew where he stood he knew exactly what he was commissioned for verse 19 chapter 19 ver1 I I mean and it came to pass when King Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord he didn't go look to some sort of other Guru some other source he went right to the message for his day amen he went right to the house of the Lord to see what could happen and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the Scribe and the Elders of the priest covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet Hallelujah he went right to the word for his day didn't he Hallelujah the son of Amos and they said unto him thus saith Hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to birth and there is not strength to bring forth you know brothers and sisters I can't help but take and look at this as a spiritual connotation for the day in which we live the devil is Raging our city our our Jerusalem City this Promised Land the Holy Ghost is under siege and if you think it's not you're deceived our cities are under siege by the devil today doesn't mean they're taken by the devil what I'm saying is just like this story he's making his boast continually making his boast saying are you going to follow the leadership of the message of the hour are you really going to do that are you going to follow the word of the Prophet for your day are you really going to do that continually trying to break us down to wear us down and we know the word of God says that you know he's going to try and Stamp Out the residue of the Believers on the earth out of the Book of Revelation he's going to try and wear down the Saints and the word of God says that he will wear down the Saints right but he won't destroy them hallelujah amen but this scripture here that says this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy me for the children are come to birth and there is not strength to bring forth the mothers are just about ready to pass the baby they're just about ready to give birth but you know if they don't have strength to push what's going to happen they're going to die they're going to die trying to give birth now I can't help but think brothers and sisters this goes a long ways our way when we get that opportunity to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the new birth saying that I believe the message of the hour that's not the new birth saying that I was raised in the message of the hour is not the new birth and even going and getting baptized in water is not the New Birth the new birth is Jesus Christ the person coming in taking aode and living out through our lives that's the new birth sir and it all comes exactly how we just described but I wonder if some people aren't to the place where they're just about ready to have that new birth but there's no spiritual strength to bring them forward and what causes that oh there's a multiplicity of things that will cause that but I'll say this probably the biggest thing is not feeding on the word of God properly and you know what when we don't hold this word of God continually before our eyes day and night when we don't follow the word of God and hold it before our children's eyes day and night and teach them the statutes of this living God that Hezekiah followed when we don't do that what happens is we cause them to live a life thinking they're saved and they're not yes sir yes sir and they come to the place of the new birth and they're just not able they just don't have the strength I want to say today brothers and sisters push aside all of our cares all of our thoughts all of our for former thinking our Traditions our ideas and have the strength the spiritual strength to be able to bring forth properly verse four says it may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words it may be that the Lord can hear all his words right this bad guy RAB RAB Shaka who the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the Living God and will reprove The Words which the Lord thy God hath heard wherefore for lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left so the Servants of King Hezekiah came to who prophet Isaiah and Isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith who Lord the Lord when the Devil comes around and says thus saith the king we have the key we have thus saith the Lord brothers and sisters and if you wonder whether you do or you don't the prophet of God God who is rich in Mercy through the prophet to us in the day in which we live he ha he said she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that yes Lord amen and I want to encourage us what to do with that is when we hear thus saith the king thus saith the master thus saith whatever it is that we serve thus saith whatever it is that we feel like we're burdened under that we just can't escape when we hear that thus saith remember thus sayith the lord it's for you and Isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master you you you the prophet of God now taking over grabbing the rains and saying you just give him this word right thus sayith the Lord be not afraid of The Words which thou Hast heard with which the Servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me behold I will send a blast upon him isn't this interesting when I first was going through this I thought a blast upon him maybe a nuclear blast maybe a uh a non-nuclear but really powerful blast maybe a a furnace wind blast what was it the blast was a rumor it was a rumor murmuring chattering behold I will send a blast on him and he shall hear a rumor and shall return to his own land and I will cause him to Fall by The Sword in his own land and you know that's exactly what happened to this guy he fell by The Sword in his own land and how did he fall by the sword he was in his Temple he was worshiping his gods and it was his son his own offspring came and skewered him thus saith the king let not thy God in whom thou trust us deceive thee that is what he said to the king verse 10 says thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah saying let not thy God in whom thou trust us deceive thee saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria he was bold he had an anointing same with the devil today he's bold he's got an anointing this is his evil age he's the God of this evil age brothers and sisters this is the only age where he was labeled that the God of this evil age yes Lord but you're the bride of Christ he can have this age can't he he can have this whole world but give me Jesus right amen why verse 14 says and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of The Messengers and read it and when Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord what did he do this was the letter that this King The King The Great king thus saith the king this guy he had his letter head he probably had an official sealed stamp on it you could imagine he was a very pompus guy he had this great letter what did The King The King Hezekiah do he took it he re received it but he took it up and he spread it before the Lord he didn't summon together a a group of Believers to have a meeting to see what we should do in a council meeting and and decide as a committee how we should go forwards with this what did he do he took it to the Lord and He spread it before the Lord and he said Lord you know all of the circumstances of my life and and now this is what this king is trying to do and I want to encourage us brothers and sisters if we've got problems in our lives if we've got devils in our lives don't be afraid the devil is going to tell us you've got too much to do there's way too much on your plate you don't have enough time I want to encourage you to take the time to bring that letter that the devil is trying to boast in your camp and bring it before the Lord in prayer take the time to pray bring it to the house of the Lord come to prayer meeting and see if God is not God see if he won't honor your sacrifice do you know the greatest sacrifice that we could give him is our time that's the greatest Talent the greatest sacrifice that we could ever give him some might say well brother Barry I'm sorry for spitting I can't help but get excited some might say brother Barry I I work hard and I earn hard and I tithe hard that's not the sacrifice he's looking for you can say that to your children all you want your whole life and your children are going to say but where are you I don't want your money all I want is you that's all all he wants is us if you want to give him a sacrifice give them your time take from your time say I know I've got a full schedule I'm so busy that's the world we live in but see if he won't honor you maybe he'll give us the opportunity to have less to do and actually earn more from it because we're putting him first we're not putting other things first we're not putting Devils first we're saying Lord be God in my life am let my children see god with skin on Hezekiah had an experience he took this problem and he spread it out before the Lord and verse 15 says and Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord God of Israel which dwellest between the cherubims Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou Hast made heaven and earth right Lord bow down thine ear and hear Open Lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of Sienna cherub and remember all of these Messengers aren't who he labeled he put it right back on The King and I think brothers and sisters it's important for us to remember we need to put it right back on the devil don't put it on the symptoms don't go for all of the symptoms for a topical ointment all along the way go right back to the source and say it's the devil this is the devil all the words of Sienna cherub which ha sent him to reproach the Living God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed the Nations and their lands you can see it with natural causes all around it's it's naturally there's no hope and have cast their gods Into the Fire for they were no Gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore have they destroyed them now therefore oh Lord Our God I beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God am even thou only then Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos sent to Hezekiah saying thus saith the Lord God of Israel oh my that which thou Hast prayed to me against the king against Sienna cherub against this guy the king of Assyria have I heard brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us don't worry he hears he's listening and and I think he's actually agonizing to hear our words to him and when we get so busy in our lives and we just don't have words to him we're busy with everything else in our lives it pains him because he wants to bless us what a thousand times more than we're really willing to actually get it you know going back a little bit I just think it's really good I I just want to dwell here for a few minutes we've got a few minutes left I I didn't even get to any quotes today maybe next time maybe we'll get one in but just going back into uh 2 Kings chapter 18 verse 31 hearken not to hez a for thus saith the king of Assyria I just think it's real important to highlight this part here which I did in my Bible make an agreement with me let's make a deal right make a deal with me make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat every eat ye every man of his own Vine and everyone of his fig tree and drink ye every one of the Waters of his sistern until I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and Vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die isn't that interesting he's actually saying exactly what the children of Israel have already heard and they were already there I think it's just amazing how we can look at this and say wow this is exactly what the the Lord told him turn back to numbers turn back with me to numbers let's just bring it out in the scripture here I think it's so so good to show that the devil he's going to come with truth he's going to come with the word and I'll say this he'll even try and come with a message and try and confuse us and try and bring situations and problems and make us look at natural circumstances and think there's no way that this is right there's no way this could be God be careful yes sir God can be moving in people's lives but here we have this guy this this this guy coming and and saying that he's going to come and deliver everyone and and give them this this this land and and in numbers 14 verse 23 talking about the spies remember there was 12 that went up of them they said oh no the natural circumstances uh-uh I mean Naturally Speaking how could this ever be this is never going to work there was only two right out of all the Valiant men 23 and they came unto the brook of eshkol and cut down from then a bunch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff two men had to carry that bunch of grapes they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called The Brook eshal because of the cluster of grapes with the children of Israel cut down from then and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of peran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it they brought it all as evidence and they showed it to him and now here we have the children of Israel in their promised land with the king of Assyria coming and trying to tell them preach to them the same gospel they're already in their positions but yet he's coming and trying to make his boast what a terrible thing thing I'm just so thankful in our day that we had a prophet that actually came and and brought us into the parallel of the Book of Joshua and that is the book of Ephesians if you want to turn over there with me today I think it's real good for us to just sometimes have a little refresher to remember that it doesn't matter what the king of whoever is going to say whatever the devil is whatever his boast is is irrelevant he's going to try and bring truth truth but the truth is what's going to make us free you know out of the book of Ephesians chapter 1 remember brother bradam said that the book of Ephesians what does he say mostly parallels it he says it perfectly parallels the Book of Joshua Amen in the Book of Joshua God commissions Joshua right at the very beginning and says Don't Be Afraid don't be dismayed don't be discouraged but be strong and of a good courage because every single place the soul of your foot Treads is yours amen that's your position that's your promise land and we're in our day we have a prophet that would take us and lead us to the book of Ephesians telling us this is our promised land in the Holy Ghost so everywhere our feet tread in the word of God in the Holy Ghost is our possession amen it doesn't matter what the Devil comes around and tells us you don't got the Holy Ghost tell them to beat it I've got the Holy Ghost because I believe this word am I think it's just beautiful I could read the whole thing I I I don't know I don't think I want to today but just for time's sake verse four out of Ephesians chapter 1 according as he hath chosen Us in in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love we're not we're not going to fall amen if we're willing to accept this word brothers and sisters you can never fall because he's chosen us to be holy and Without Blame period that's all he's he's predestinated us verse five having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will aren't you thankful that God would send us a prophet in our day and say that this word adoption is not saying that I'm just going to go out into the highways and the byways I'm going to go to a an orphanage and I'm going to find a little child and I'm just going to take it and adopt it and and call it my own and give it my name and and we're just going to live our lives together pretending that we're the same family that's not what this word means what this word means is this was always my son this was always my daughter and now I'm going to take them because they're mature and I'm going to declare to the devil and all of the host of Heaven this is my beloved Son hear ye him now some people are going to say brother Barry you're going forwards and saying that you're talking about Jesus well who's in you that's right the devil don't want us talking that way people are going to start getting nervous when you start talking like that but let's call it what it is who is the Bride of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen we can't put anyone in or take anyone out because it's the good pleasure of his will brothers and sisters to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted and the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace Hallelujah the devil's going to say look what you did look who you are look at what's going on in your life you can't get over it and you know what if you say yeah I don't think I can you're making a deal with the devil that's right but if you say I don't like it I know I I don't like it I know what it is and I hear it every single day when I hear that voice when I get that Temptation when that thing comes around and I can just simply say no I hate it no I don't like it and I don't want nothing to do with it when you have that desire brothers and sisters that means there's life still inside of you so long as you've got the desire get up get up and keep marching don't give up don't give in don't don't don't don't listen to the devil wherein he hath abounded to us in all wisdom and Prudence he's given us the ability to understand all of this it's not something that we need to poke at and prod at and say it's a mystery because verse n says having made known unto us the mystery of his will remember we talked about his will at length what is his will it's his word and it's not just a word in print it's the word that's been quickened to us through the word of a Vindicated prophet that's the word we're talking about the life of Jesus Christ in our Lives having made known unto us he's made known unto us what the mystery of his will is and it's according to his good pleasure again which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times are we at the dispensation of the fullness of times I would say we're we've never been closer have we he might gather together in one amen all things in Christ both which are in heaven and are in Earth even in him I think it's so beautiful we look at that verse there how can we ever say that there needs to be division there needs to be walls there needs to be separation I personally believe when we start hearing those words and we start hearing those rumors what it means is it's not according to his will that's right amen because his will says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him and then he goes on to talk about how we have an inheritance and you know we're not just getting an inheritance we actually are an inheritance Jesus was given an inheritance by the father and he went to the cross and paid the price and bought our Redemption for all the transgressions that could ever happen in the life of a human being he bore it all upon himself and every single person who is called before the foundation of the world is his inheritance and he will not lose one of them because Jesus Christ is not just on Earth hoping and waiting for the father to actually say now I give you permission to do this and now I give you permission to do that like we might with our children Jesus Christ remember we know this this is Elementary Jesus Christ was God he he was God Only God God could actually step out of the back of the ship when everything was going crazy around all the storm there and just put his foot up on the bow and just simply say not even yell just simply say peace be still all creation follows the voice of that man who could do that but God who was it that walked up to the grave of Lazarus and wept oh my it was a man that had compassion for his brother he knew where he was and he knew how everyone around couldn't understand what was happening but we know the prophet in our day said when he stepped forward and put his shoulders back and puffed his chest out and he said Lazarus come forth that was all man but it was also all God because only God could do something like that why in whom we also have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen not even our will yes his own will brothers and sisters I just can't help but think we've got every single reason to Rejoice this is God's work this is God's word this is God's message this is God's Redemption this is God's grace to each and every one of us to understand that we don't need to be bound by Devils we don't need to be bound by the king of Assyria and all of his bad guy Messengers we can tell all of them you just take that letter from thus saith the king you just take him thus sayith the Lord I am redeemed I don't have to listen to you I just think it's a wonderful thing brothers and sisters I I just wanted to try and encourage us today don't make a deal with the devil don't make a deal with that thing in your life don't make a deal with that thing in your relationships don't make a deal with that thing in your business don't make a deal with that thing in your school whatever it is don't make a deal with it simply say thus sayith the Lord be it unto me ACC according to Thy word and say Lord God I know I've had an experience with you and I need another one right now and I guarantee you his ears are open just like they were to Hezekiah because if you have the ability to hear this message then all the words that we just spoke out of Ephesians chapter 1 are about you yes Hallelujah so if Hezekiah was righteous and pure in heart before the Lord so are you amen speak the word brothers and sisters don't be AF afraid to March forward because he's with you there's way more with us than there is against us don't make a deal with the devil we're not interested in making a deal this is not let's make a deal this is thus saith the Lord I know who I am God bless you this morning let's stand to our feet we've got a service tonight I don't want to keep us long I'll call the musicians Romans 5 verse verse one therefore being justified by faith what we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where we stand access by faith we believe we've got access to it and rejoice in the hope of the glory of the Lord amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations also oh my do we I don't like tribulations but we're able to glory in those tribulations knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience what has aaya been able to pray the way he prayed if he didn't have experience sir if he didn't have trial in his life think about what he must have gone through yes sir at 25 years of age to take the throne yes of Judah and smash the images and tear down the Groves think about the resistance that he would have had to put up with from all of the elders all of the religious ones all the ones with tenure how much he would have had to put up with how much tribulation he would have had to go through but he knew the god of Israel amen hallelujah and not only so but we glory
