The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto everyone of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled may the Lord at a reading to the blessing of his word please be seated good and blessed morning to each and every one of you I

praise the Lord thank you so my title this morning is the souls Under The Altar and this is the fifth seal amen fif seal so who are they who are these Souls under the altar that has been crying before the Lord how long oh Lord how long shall you avenge our blood from them that killed us in the message entitled uh the fifth seal 1963 now notice this these Souls under the altar well these Souls understanding now that's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful men like ikan see they're holding right on millions of them but they remain Jews they were killed for the word of God's sake not for the testimony of Christ did you understand that but remember the church come in also the martys of the church was for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ excuse but this did not have the test Tony of Jesus Christ the Jews and Hitler hated them so did ikan so did Stalin all of the rest of the world see but they stayed true to what they believe and they killed them because they were Jews did you know Martin Luther Kind of had the same idea too it's the truth he said all Jews should be taken out their Antichrist but he was just under another dispensation and did not see it did not see the word amen in another quotation prophet of God said notice they ask for Revenge if that had been the bride it's been like steepen far forgive them you know but these are Jews that's just come in they ask for revents notice it's thy Brethren the Jews the hundred they wanted Revenge they said we want you to Revenge us down there and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth Earth and white robes not linen linen is for the bride white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little season until their fellow servants till thy fellow servants thy fellow servants and also thy Brethren that should should be killed thy Brethren they thy Brethren had yet to be killed which means the 144,000 yet to be killed in the tribulation 144,000 that's called now watch they have to be martyred by the Antichrist which just come through and notice in his last ride when he breaks that Covenant with them Jews there the these Jews the 144,000 is to be called out by two witnesses of Revelation 11 and those Souls that's been martyred down through here real true Jews down through there that had their name on the book that Liv the life the right life and done the right thing leave Judaism to the dot there they were marted by ikan and many others honest people millions of them down there Germans shut them to death murdered them and killed them hung them on the fences and burned them up cremated them and everything else that bloodless bloode hearted hungry Hitler and Stalin and musolini and all of them people that hated them Jews amen can we say Amen praise the Lord when was these Souls under the altar slain the prophet of God said in the PIP seal 1963 those Souls watch under the altar of the breaking of this seal that had been [Music] slain in the time between the death of Christ and the going up of the church praise the Lord amen the next question is when will the two two prophets and the 144,000 Jews will be killed Daniel chapter 9:27 and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week seven years and in the midst of the week three and one half he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even until the consumation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate and in Revelation 11:7 to12 it says and they shall have finished and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast the Antichrist that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which is spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where our where also our Lord was crucified and they of the people and Kindred and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in Graves see how cruel the word will be and they that dwell D upon the Earth shall rejoice over them and make Merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them with plagues to be put that dwell on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them with saw them and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up heeter and they ascended up Hallelujah that's the six Rapture up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them to God be praised to God be the glory amen now after the three and one half years tribulation the prophet of God said then the Antichrist turns on the Jews and and that is what the Bible calls Jacob's trouble if you read in the Holy Bible the Jacob's trouble comes after the great Revelation when the Antichrist begins to kill the two prophets and the 144,000 question and answer 1964 the church is ending and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered into the tribulation period no no no no no I wish I could just have more time on that the bride when she is taken from the church then the church AIDS will cease Le leoda goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation sets upon tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for how many years for three and a half years while while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon Israel see they are not at the same time the tribulation or Jacob's trouble does not happen at the same time as the foolish virgins because the prophet of God said while there is tribulation to the foolish virgins the two prophets are preaching peacefully amen no plagues to the Israelites amen but they're just sounding the seven trumpets okay to call out the 144,000 Israelites amen I hope we can follow that from the message of the Prophet amen so the Jacob's trouble happened after the Great Tribulation and at that time shall Michael let's get Daniel 12th chapter of Daniel and at that time shall Michael who is Michael the prophet of God said Michael is Christ amen amen and you know who who that is shall stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble what is it right after this tribulation see that's a Jacob trouble there brothers and sisters amen when the Antichrist the prophet of God said break his Covenant in the midst that's after 3 and one years that's when he persecutes and kills the two prophets Moses and Elijah and the 144,000 praise the Lord amen I hope the holy spirit is is clear on these things my brothers amen all right and that will happen after the wedding ceremony in heaven question and answer 1964 even his wife was in the palace the type that the bride will be in the palace in glory at that time then Jesus makes himself known to the Jews after the wedding ceremony the three and a half years in Jacob's trouble that three and a half years the end of the 70th week of Daniel praise the Lord amen to God be the glory and the prophet of God said in the message 70th week of Daniel 1961 he said notice these two prophets what will they do it's Moses and Elijah that will rise on the scene they will tell those Jews their mistake and out of that Jewish bands that's there now to be 144,000 God will call by this prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah of this Gentile Church listen the spirit of Elijah will just from the Gentile church will just continue Hallelujah right into that Jewish Church go right on in and call Moses with them Hallelujah you see it and he will preach the same message of Pentecost to those Jews this same message amen amen will be preached to those 144,000 that they rejected the Messiah amen you see it it will be the same Pentecostal message that these Jews will preach right over to them and they will hate those Jews so bad till they killed them and they were hated by All Nations and in the mids of the week because that they had raised up a great powerful 144,000 they had the Holy Ghost and brother you talk about doing Miracles they did them they stopped the heavens and it did not rain in the days of their prophecy smoke the Earth with plags as of as they want to they give plags and everything else they'll give them Romans a hard way to go but finally they'll be killed our God is a terrible God when he is angered but remember that's over in the 70th week and the church is in glory amen the wedding supper is going on yes the 17th week this G goes on during the 70th week in threee in the tree in the middle of it he breaks because he he kills see after breaking the Covenant because he kills those two Pentecostal prophets blessed be the word of the Lord amen now who are these two prophets okay Revelation 11:4 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and who is the god of the earth Matthew 171-3 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him who is the god of the Earth none other our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and the two o of trees the two prophets standing beside him now there are many interpretation to Moses and Elijah to the denomination they said Moses and Elijah is the old and the New Testament that's what they believe it's not a person it's the old and the New Testament but we know that is wrong now even in this message there are many interpretation to Moses and Elijah they said that reading about what the prophet of God said about Moses and Elijah I would not want to add any of my thoughts here that's why all these quotations are compiled before you I don't want to add anything from my own thoughts because I believe that the Bible and the message of the hour can interpret itself you don't need to add to it you just have to have patience in reading and searching and praying for the leading of the Holy Spirit to bring these things to the people not your own thoughts I I don't want to add my own thoughts on anything of this my brothers and my sisters it's very dangerous for a preacher to put any interpretation to this amen and this is we know that the prophet said said this about Moses and Elijah hear ye him Peter got all excited the supernatural had been done there stood Moses and Elijah but been dead for years here they were standing alive standing there with Jesus witnesses to of the mightest prophets that ever walk on the earth standing by the side to watch God adopt his own son and another quotation question in answer 1957 okay the first one is 1958 the second one is 1957 the prophet said this and after a while down from heaven come one Chariot of fire and angels of fire horses of fire and Elijah stepped on and went up into Glory he never tested that he was translated then the prophet said he's got to die and then in paragraph 726 he said there stood both Moses and Elijah standing there talking to him certainly they did they're not dead they had never died they're Mortals they got to die that's what the prophet of God said there but in 19 in another quotation the prophet of God said here he was asked if the two prophets are literally Moses and Elijah or the Jews and this is what he said the six seal now here are these two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to Nature they want to and they shake the Earth and it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah re patterned again amen and in the six 1963 it's Moses and Elijah cuz there is there is their Ministry re impersonated it's both men and then in this one quote question and answer 1963 the prophet said this brother Bram it was asked if all of The Godly was taken up in the Rapture where will Elijah and Moses come from will they be Jews or will our Elijah given to us be with them he said the Gentile that will be Anointed with this Spirit to call out the Gentiles will be taken away because the whole church has been taken up these two prophets the 11th chapter is brought down and the day of Grace is ended with the Gentile and being sent to the Jews no it won't be the same man I'm pretty sure of that remember they're just the best of my knowledge see what the prophet said before that he said the spirit of Elijah that was on the Gentiles will move on Amen to the 144,000 amen so so I remain with this quotes of the Prophet because why because Elijah like Enoch has been translated to Heaven a long time ago amen and you cannot enter Heaven without being glorified because 1 Corinthians 15:50 says now this I say Brethren the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit corruption see they have to be translated they have to be changed because flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven amen and again we know that the prophet that the Bible says here there are six raptures that happened amen about to happen the prophet of God said three rapture in the Old Testament and three Rapture on the New Testament the first Rapture is Enoch Genesis 5:24 the second Rapture is Elijah 2 Kings 2:11 the third Rapture is Jesus Christ acts 1:9 now we have already had three raptures in the Old Testament did you know that Enoch was one Elijah was the other one and Jesus Hallelujah was the other one can we say Amen brothers and sisters and in the New Testament the first Rapture is Matthew 27:45 to 53 that's the Old Testament Church resurrected after our Lord raised from the dead amen and the prophet said that the New Testament 1 Thessalonians 4:12 to18 is the second Rapture of the New Testament amen and the third Rapture is revelation 111-12 the two prophets amen now there has been one Rapture already passed and that's Matthew 27 and the graves were open and many of the bodies of the saints that slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many one Rapture dis passed that's the Old Testament the second is fulfilled in 2 Thessalonians 4 and that's our Rapture hallelujah amen and that's under the seven seal the opening Hallelujah of the word and the third the prophet of God said is revelation 11:11 amen there is your three raptures of the New Testament three raptures of the Old Testament all of them now okay okay passed but of course the Rapture of the church is we are waiting amen everybody say praise the Lord are you ready for the rupture of the church amen now the next question is who else is under the altar who else is under the altar this is what the prophet of God said Hebrews 1957 just remember how many has died in each generation that has been Christians down through the age they're all resurrect that makes up the body you expect there be a 100 billion in this America come out or some other this world today there might not be 50 come out but the great Ransom church is laying in the dust a waiting they are God's they are God's Jewel that's resting in the dust but their soul are under the altar of God Amen they are not in their right state they're in a body truly but a theop and they C cry out to God how long they could see one another but they could not shake each other's hands that kind of body amen I I I I believe the prophet's quote is clear to us brothers and sisters amen okay so it's not only the juice that is under the altar but even the Believers the bride who have died before us from Pentecost to this day they are there wait K amen blessed be the name of Jesus all right where is under the altar the prophet of God said here is what happens if you die now according to the word of God you go out of the existence of the people who can see you into his presence and there you live you can look back you're not in the world no more you're in another world and then what do you do you're like those Souls under the altar saying Lord how long will it be see you will never be an angel you was not made an angel you were made men and women so you are longing to come back cuz you can see then when you get up here and say oh I see what it's all about I know why I had to die there I know why that taken place you the prophet of God said then you say paragraph 233 how long is it Lord now listen listen church cuz you was not made to be there you say Amen to that you are not made to be there you was not made to be there you was not made that because you are a human being and you're longing to come back into this body perfect again can we say praise the Lord after you go out of this body 235 out of the cosmic light and petroleums and what you're made up of you go into the fourth d Dimension out of that into The Fifth Dimension then the sixth Dimension then God is in this heav you are right under his altar amen praise the Lord to God be the glory then hallelujah when God lets your spirit loose it picks up what comes out of the sixth dimension in into the fifth Cosmic light come out of the light into petroleums out of petroleums into the senses and there here you are back on Earth again a brand new person not old and broke down never to be sick your hair will never turn gray will never be wrinkled you'll never separate no more you'll never die you'll never be hungry you'll never have a worry you'll walk with your loved ones shake their hands eat and drink build houses and inhabit them and live forever and ever in the presence of the Lord Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord amen what a message amen the message is the thought of God telling us what he had in mind before the foundation of the world so what happens when a Believer dies now where will he go okay the prophet of God said under the altar sixth Dimension because God is on the seven another quotation 1961 faith when you die your soul will go under the altar of God okay right in the presence of God your spirit will go to God you cannot come back remember in the Bible the souls under the altar crying how long how long Lord and they could not return until the scriptures fulfill Christ could not return till the scriptures fulfill see but the souls under the alar the Believers and Christ himself cannot and could not return until the scripture is fulfilled then after all that had been done all the suffering is over and the Brethren have suffered the same things or we have suffered like they suffered and so forth then on that day Hallelujah you'll know exactly where you're buried your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to the soul amen paragraph seven the soul which is a body that does not have to eat if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you are raised up again this natural body for that great millenum amen see Soul Celestial and spirit United reunited again and the glorified body for the millennial Reign amen now in what form we go into that under the altar the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 51 two for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown in this Tabernacle earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven Heavenly house amen the Bible calls it the Heavenly house waiting for us and what is exactly this heavenly house is prophet of God said once more okay let me read one more scriptures 1 Corinthians 15:40 to 44 and 50 there are also celestial bodies Celestial means Heavenly and bod is terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is about is one and and the glory of the terrestrial is another it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body now this I say Brethren flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit in corruption prophet of God said in the message life and when we die from this life we go into the body which if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have aop to go into a body Celestial see the prophet inter change the word theop and Celestial Heavenly Body and theop now what is a theop or a Celestial body message of the Prophet question and answers again 1961 are you still there my brothers and sisters thank you as soon as is it born in this world and breaths its first breath it becomes a living Soul because as soon as this Earthly body is Born Into the world there is a Celestial body or a spiritual body to take hold of it and as as soon as this natural body is dropped there is a Heavenly Tabernacle waiting for it if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there is a Heavenly Tabernacle waiting for it as soon as the baby is dropped into the Earth in flesh there is a spiritual body waiting to receive it and as soon as the spiritual body natural body is dissolved there is a spiritual body waiting y there see at theop we call it a theop question answer 1961 well now this body this theop body is temporar that temporary brother pending the resurrection of this body brother Bon was asked is that body the open is Celestial temporary the prophet said yes it's temporary oh yes that's the condition that we are going to live until the resurrection amen amen I hope that's clear brothers and sisters amen that's right paragraph 333 and when that Tabernacle that soul that theophany they left there in that body they come back back to the Earth and that type of body they had took on immortality the dust of the earth gathered into that theop the dust of the earth gathered into that theop Hallelujah and somehow they become human again amen had to eat like they did in the Garden of Eden amen amen hallelujah you believe that we will e amen at that glorified body Jesus our lord ate after the resurrection but we don't need restroom it's a powerful body amen amen we don't need restroom amen it's a complete perfect body that God will make amen now if we eat today one kilo there is a waste maybe half kilo or 1/4 because our body is just not perfect you know we could not consume everything right but in that body you can eat and don't need anything all right that's what the prophet of God said we will eat in that body and we will even drink at that day communion and bread at that day amen amen at the married supper of the Lamb amen hallelujah now this is what the prophet of God thirsting for Life what is theop to open it's a body that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a b that's waiting for you Christians as soon as the life lives this you go into that body when the this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting at the open amen praise the Lord a body without a spirit the prophet of God said in another quotation in Hebrews chapter 4 the prophet of God said it's a theop the kind of body that we go to not a glorified body but an in jail body like has shape and form and another quotation adoption someday Jesus is coming and this Angelic body this theop that I'm living in will not come through the womb of a woman anymore it will not come through sexual desire anymore but because that he was born without sexual desire I'll be resurrected without it and he will speak someday and the dead in Christ shall rise and that body that I once live in that theop Angelic form will resurrect into a glorified body and I'll walk and talk and I live and enjoy Hallelujah I will live through the Eternal ages that is to come through Jesus Christ Our Lord woo there you are brother that's the gospel hallelujah amen and amen hallelujah I hope you're still there my brothers and sisters amen hallelujah I'm still inspired I hope you're still inspired amen making a way in that chesal body we cannot shake hand the prophet of God said amen prophet of God said when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting we enter into that we'll know one another we cannot shake hands we have no senses of that feeling I could shake your hand how do you do brother you would not have that type of hand but yet we're not in a Corporal body and we are now we are in a Celestial body body Hebrews chapter 6 again now when we go from here there's Tabernacle a theop just an image of a man that don't eat Don't drink don't sleep and awake forever that's what the prophet of God said that's how he defined and explain the theop and Celestial without adding my thoughts on it my brothers and my sisters because I believe the message is complete you don't have to interpret it let it interpret itself the Holy Ghost can interpret itself he doesn't need any man know to interpret the Holy Ghost can interpret by just the dailing the scriptures and the quotations there you go the revelation of the Prophet from God is given to the bride in these last days now the souls under the altar are they in their right State even though they are in theop even though they are in the heavenly bodies Hebrews chapter 4 again the prophet of God said the the great ransome church is laying in the dust awaiting there are God's Jewels that's resting in the dust but their souls are under the alter they are not in their right Tate amen they are in a body truly but a theop and they cry out to God how long they could see one another but they could not shake each other's hands that kind of a body amen and this question how long shall they stay in that body amen I say they because we are not there yet amen we are here and I believe not all the Believers will die some of the Believers will be waiting here for a chance for the coming of the Lord amen but we are not scared to die to go under the souls on under the altar right amen and this is what the prophet of God said how long shall they stay in that body God perfect perfecting his church when a saint dies I'm not able to tell you what kind of a body he receives but it's not a glorified body it's not a spirit but it's some kind of a body that will last that will last until the resurrection amen it's a temporary body the first one that we have read from the message of the Prophet it will last until the resurrection and that body is not complete according to the prophet God's only provided place of worship 1965 amen and there's one body here then that body there which is the celestial body amen the open Celestial and then the glorified body in the resurrection Hallelujah see that makes it complete hallelujah hallelujah that makes it complete amen it's a temporal body that will last until the resurrection then it will become complete when it picks up the glorified body in the resurrection everybody say praise the Lord brothers and sisters and the prophet of God in another message in the question and answer 1953 he said see Let Me continue let me go Direct to that paragraph 87 but now here's the Glorious part hallelujah amen on the return of Jesus at the resurrection it won't be that body that body then that supernatural being that God created in the beginning that will return to the Earth to get a another body not born by woman but created by God Hallelujah to never get old or have a rinkle never have a gray hair on your head but the be perfect forever amen that would make me shout on a hot night Hallelujah that's right this robe of Flesh I'll drop rise and sees the Everlasting price oh hallelujah what in the word we got to worry about amen the mighty conqueror 1956 and when we go out of this earth when we die we're going into another type of body that's not the kind of body we was not made for heaven hallelujah amen we were made for Earth we are Earth people do you remember in the Bible Souls under the altar crying they were crying to get back to a body shake hands with another hand and eat and fellowship that's what we were made that's how what we were made for hallelujah amen W it made for heavens we are made for Earth our soul is from heaven but our body it came from the earth amen and that's why we will live here we'll stay here new Heaven and new earth amen hallelujah we were not going to stay in heaven we are going to stay here Amen Let It Be The Name Of The Lord so we was not made for heaven and that part of that body that's what the prophet of God said amen making a way someday he will rise Hallelujah in that Corporal body he will rise my brothers and my sisters amen he will rise in that Corporal body and when he returns back this celestial bodies which were under the altars they will take onor glorification and we will be like him and we will live forever in that body amen hallelujah hear his voice 1958 but then when that body kind of celestial body when it returns back to Earth it picks up the substance that it once lived then it becomes a glorified body and that body Hallelujah is is the one that we will see our lord Jesus in his resurrected body is that not appear yet what we shall be said Paul but we know we shall have a body like his own glorified body for we shall see him as he is amen see brothers and sisters those Souls under the altar they're crying see now that we are living in this earth we are groaning for our Heavenly Body we are groaning for that Celestial body but when you get there you will be we will begin to cry how long Lord we come back to our body amen hallelujah it's a different dimension when you are here Lord I Want to Go to Heaven Lord I want to go to the souls under the altar when I die when you get there you will be crying how long how long Lord will you sit on your throne because all the souls under the altar are just waiting for that Corporal body to sit or to stand up see the souls Under The Altar and even us we are looking at that Corporal body of the Lord Jesus Christ to stand up because the moment he stood from that throne those Souls under the altars the Believers brothers and sisters they will return pick up the glorified body brothers and sisters and we shall be changed the Believers that are alive we shall be changed amen we don't have to go there although the Bible says we will we will go for three years and a half married subur of the lamb but we don't have to die if Jesus comes and we are still alive he will change us completely amen amen and we will enter there with a glorified body amen are you still there brothers and sisters amen and this is what the prophet of God said question answer 1957 someday goes right back to there and then when the theop becomes Immortal bless again now no this this last last word when the theop becomes Immortal flesh again like it was in the beginning what beginning when was this beginning when we had this Immortal body brothers and sisters as it was in the beginning see there's a revelation hidden there amen prophet of God said as it was in the beginning this theop becomes Immortal flesh again like it was in the beginning amen so all the souls Under The Altar and these people down here on Earth we are waiting for that Corporal body to stand but the prophet of God said it will not stand there it will wait for the last name to be called to be washed by the blood to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we can all go to the Rapture you see and that's why and that's why we need to go out and preach the gospel to all the world because that's how the Lord will call that last name amen and the prophet of God said if you can go because you're so busy amen you know what he said there amen hallelujah you can go send somebody amen amen somebody that will look for the soul not to make their pocket fat because of your support and to make them themselves rich and above all the rest of the ministers no amen sometimes we have to be careful with our money brothers and sisters amen hallelujah make sure it's going to the lost souls and that's going to the wallet and the pocket of the people who enrich themselves amen then we have to answer to God for all those things amen so God help us amen God be with us are you still there my brothers and sisters amen thank you for your patience now what is really AR theophany this is one of the question has been lingering in the minds of many ministers and members as well this really AR theop now you will be surprised when you read this Co more prophet teaching clearly what is the opening okay prophet of God said okay let me go to this when God made man he made him aop in the message Hebrews question answers on Hebrews part 3 1957 God help us please continue your focus to this it is very important my brothers and sisters on this part of the message it's very important to really focus your attention here CU there's so much misunderstanding about the theop now in this message but we don't want to interpret anything we just want the prophet speak for itself the word of God Amen and this is what the prophet of God said paragraph 8:22 when he the logos went out of God which was God coming from this one big Fountain into a body in the form of a man and it made the logos which we call theop okay so God the spirit has a body and it's a the prophet of God said it is a form of a man logos theop amen paragraph 824 if you take the theophany when you're looking at that that's a man see that's what we were in the beginning okay now you do not understand it now but you was back there in the beginning that way when God made Man In His Image he made him a theop and he only placed him in flesh when God made Man In His Image in his likeness Genesis 2 or Genesis 1 128 I believe there was no man yet to till the soil and God had done made male and female that's right no man to te the soil amen amen see 825 then God brought man a little lower and put him in animal life that's this body amen just like the animals so that he could till the soil could touch that theop doesn't touch he doesn't see taste smell and hear the senses that we have so God put man down there to touch and to F amen see the combination of the theophany and the body Genesis 1:28 26-28 and Genesis 2:7 God for man from the dust of the earth 826 now listen to this church please amen and he walked through the Garden of Eden first as a Theo like the holy spirit is in here now walking in here it led the animal life it controlled everything but it could not till the soil see theop walking in the Garden but it could not till the soil so what God did to the theop amen are you still there brothers and sisters thank you so God put him in flesh what did he what did he put in flesh that the he put him in flesh so that he could tell the soil give him five senses to till the soil The Vineyards and so forth and the man still look Lonesome oh this is a beautiful picture paragraph 8-7 notice now when he first made he made two people together he was made both male and female that man was the Bible said he was God made both male and female he created he him notice now when man was separated from the theop and put in flesh he was not just allog together there part of his being was still at the open but it did not look right part of his being was still a theop but it did not look right the prophet of God said that's why that's why he put him in the flesh not theop he said okay right let me go to paragraph 8:30 now my brothers see she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in aop she was part down here in this creation she could not be divided in other creation she had to be made in the same creation okay and paragraph now let's let's let let us go to this next quotation here this is going to shock some of us if not all Hebrews chapter 2 1957 okay let me go back go down to the yellow to the last paragraph then God made man out of Out of the Dust of the earth now okay let me go let me read it here in to paragraph 278 to complete now the logos that went out of God the logos all this begin to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholar logos theop that went out of God in other words a better word for it it was what we call a theop now close parenthesis theop is a human body that's glorified that is the complete theophany amen theophany alone soul and Celestial is not complete it has to have a glorified body amen and when we pick up that glorified body the prophet of God said Hallelujah the is a human body that's been glorified amen that is what the prophet of God and this last paragraph says amen hallelujah but the difference between an animal and a man God put put a soul in a man and he did not put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany youbody say praise the Lord see what is our theop our soul that so when we die this soul that the prophet of God called will go directly to the souls Under The Altar and wait for that Celestial body for a while until the resurrection a theop without the spirit a theop the prophet of God said not complete a theop that you cannot shake your hands and it waits for the resurrection that's why the prophet of God said theop is a human body Hallelujah that's glorified that's the complete the body that God has planned before the foundation of the world my brothers and my sisters amen hallelujah and notice the prophet of God said before we close amen prophet of God said before we close we bypass our theop that's right many of us know that quote but we must interpret that cot not with our own intelligence but with what the prophet of God said because you can get wrong because some people are thinking that we left your te open in heaven be careful of that my brothers and sisters let's follow the teaching of the Holy Ghost in the prophet God said when God he created man he did the soul and that soul in that man is is the opening amen so when we die that soul is released and temporarily waits in Souls under the Elder it's not complete it's going to wait for his glorified body before he can become complete to open open now the prophet of God said we bypass our theop let's let's read that see who is this milk acidic you see come right regular before the foundation of the world his name is put on the Lambs Book of Life he become the word the theop what kind of theop that could appear and disappear see that's theop body of God it could appear and disappear amen that's the body that's the theop the prophet is talking about the theop body that could appear and disappear amen but what did the prophet of God said he became the word that theop that could appear and disappear amen then he become flesh and returned back again resurrected in the same body in a glorified condition but you bypass that theophany that kind of body that could appear and disappear you become pleased man to be tempted by sin see we bypass that kind of body that could appear in this the prophet of God said we came directly into flesh like Adam everybody can follow that right and this is what the prophet of God said what is theop body he said theop it's called a word body this then is the state he was in when he made Abraham was called mesc he was in the form of theop see theop is not complete without a body a form and that's why God showed himself to Abraham in a theop body visible physical tangible that's what we bypass prophet of God we went directly to flesh can you say can we follow that amen now see God is Not Without a body God has a body it looks like a man in to men see so the prophet of God said he had a body he was B father Holy Ghost and dwelt in human form the theop of God the great image of God that he made man then he plac him in the earth he had a body God is Not Without a body God has got a body and it looks like a man see that brothers and sisters when you talk about theop you don't talk about the soul only you talk about the physical form of God showing himself and he could appear and disappear at the same time if he wants see the prophet of God that's what we bypassed we went directly into flesh the prophet of God called the spirit and the soul of Jesus Christ theop inment his soul his Spirit his theop of his own being went down to hell but his body was left in the grave right but his soul his Spirit his theop see God called that theop the spirit and the soul of Jesus Christ that went to hell but the body was still laying on the grave see you see understand that the open it is the spirit and the soul and the combination of a glorified body that's the complete re reation of theop brothers and sisters amen hallelujah and the prophet of God called that word form body theop he said we have not yet entered into that word form body amen but a theop see we are a theop but we have not yet entered into that word form body okay but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to byass that theop that body see you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin then the prophet of God said then from that paragraph 770 he became the word the theophany that could appear and disappear and then he become flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theop and become man to be tempted by sin we have not yet that bodies we have not yet entered the word form see so the prophet of God said how that theop is formed now because we have not yet entered the prophet of God said in who is MDC he said we are form to the word image here here we are formed to the word image where here not there here is that clear brothers and sisters here we are form to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning see where do you form your word body here by listening to the word you are forming that image of the now into this body brothers and sisters amen now let me close in a while when will you begin to form the word image who is this m mic 1965 when do we form this body paragraph 18 then hallelujah after you recognize the very word of God was heal food then you left the other thing you have then form into this living image of the Living God hallelujah here on Earth we form the theopathy word Body by listening to the word by believing all the word by being obedient to all the word by subjecting this blessing to the word here you form that image brothers and sisters if you're not believer if you are not obedient then your theophany will not happen to you amen the prophet of God said that here we form that Living Image by listening to the word and that's why the prophet of God said you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theop this revelation of the message that has been made clear to you that's your the talking to you that one day amen we will have this body blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's why the prophet of God said theop is a human body that's glorified amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord remember that was the original creation you will be surprised the prophet of God said before I close see what was Adam before he fell in sin what was he see prophet of God said but what God did paragraph 186 he breathed the breath hope eternal life amen then he become a living Soul a soul that cannot die now watch we're going to get into the honey plum to your elbows breath the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul then you say Adam died brother Bram but remember before he died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah because already this nostrils had become the breath hope Eternal God blessed be the name of Jesus see that's what the body of Adam is eternal it cannot die amen the prophet of God said Adam is a perfect spoken word and a spoken word cannot sin see one time they was not that way where did Adam fell Adam fell from eternal life then when Nature and people the Bible says are groaning they're not in their ought to be condition see they haven't fallen they have fallen from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims of eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam an animal would not die before Adam he was given premoral agency he was given to them amen you see that's what the prophet of God said amen and the prophet of God said he could control the nature amen amen he said Adam could say to this mountain move there and it would Adam could say let this tree be pled and planted over it would do it for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under our god what happened to the body of Adam that cannot die after he sin this is what the prophet of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but sin after the fall blinded every fiber in his body his mind his heart but now don't never try to study it out you cannot figure it out see prophet of God said it blinded the whole body of Adam amen it blinded everything after he become he become unconscious because of the sin all of his great channels clug up now through the fall he lost that power he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clug up and he could not get through that's what happened to the body of Adam it's not supposed to die but because of sin all his great channels of God were clug up and the prophet of God said that's what clogging us also this day the teachings of denomination the Creeds and dogmas and our worries about this life is clogging the channels of God within us and the prophet

part of this corrupt Earth and this flesh will remain here in this earth only in corruption will go to the other side but when the incorruption our soul goes to meet with our the bodies then we have the perfected body it's a tremendous thing I I just really enjoyed the thought that right now we are forming that word image body we just need to unclog the channels and you know what's the best way to unclog the channels brothers and sisters just go on our knees and speak to the Lord but we can allow the things in this life to become too busy to give us the opportunity to do that I'm preaching to myself here here remember the prayer meeting on the 7th come unclog the channels we just uh want to remind everyone we have a baptism this morning this afternoon a real special day sister Linda kabanda has the Revelation that it's her time to be baptized to be identified in a watery grave and we know this is the very first step to seeing that word image body form in our lives amen and we know that this is not where the battle stops this is merely where the battle starts but we know that he will actually guard us that he will look after us how many are going to pray for sister Linda kabanda today after she gets baptized and the days coming forward the devil doesn't want her to go on to receive the Holy Ghost we're so thankful that she wants to work on that word image body here

Hallelujah Lord it's important for us to recognize who we are and where we stand and Lord we we thank you Father that you have created us in your image and Lord you gave us the opportunity to bypass our theophanies Lord that we could come to Earth to be tried and to be tested to be born in sin shaped in iniquity it and come into this world speaking lies in this hybrid condition father but Lord nothing could change that Gene that you put inside of us from before the foundation of the world and Lord when we hear this word it causes something to LEAP inside our womb and father there's a life that Springs forward and that life the only form of incorruptable life is your very life Lord Jesus and that's what Springs to life inside of us we thank you you for that Lord thank you for our theophany bodies thank you for the ability to rise above all of the sin and the corruption in this world Lord Jesus and recognize you as you are father we just want to remember Brother Don Snow's Aunt
