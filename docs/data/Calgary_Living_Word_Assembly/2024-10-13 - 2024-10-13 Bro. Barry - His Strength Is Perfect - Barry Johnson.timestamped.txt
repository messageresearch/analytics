[45:15] I had a thought I was reading Matthew 14
[45:18] when Peter was walking on the on the
[45:20] waters and I was thinking a lot of times
[45:23] we always seem like Jesus is the one
[45:24] that called him on the water but it was
[45:26] Peter's aidea Peter wanted to go and God
[45:29] just granted it in a way in a sense it
[45:31] was like a prayer
[45:32] request and Jesus or Peter had his eyes
[45:36] solely and directly on God or on Jesus
[45:39] when he was asking the request but he
[45:41] took his eyes when he got granted the
[45:43] request and that's as Believers that's
[45:45] I'm speaking to myself it's a constant
[45:47] thing let's not forget the reason for

[53:24] Provisions that you make for us in our
[53:26] Our Lives along the way so that we could

[53:31] so we could gather this way father
[53:33] according to our natural senses Lord not
[53:36] according to our feelings father but
[53:38] it's according to your word and the way
[53:40] that you've provided is in you father
[53:44] and Lord we humbly accept your provision
[53:47] for us spiritually speaking today Lord
[53:50] oh Father our desire is to push aside

[54:20] selves and father my prayer today is
[54:23] that Lord we could just die out to
[54:25] ourselves Lord that those past hurts
[54:28] would no longer be coming to the
[54:30] Forefront of our minds causing us to act
[54:33] Lord Jesus but Lord that it would be
[54:36] your spirit that would be leading us and
[54:38] guiding us father that we would
[54:40] recognize our position Lord Jesus that
[54:43] there's no devil in hell that could
[54:45] stand before us when we are in our
[54:47] promised land in you Lord

[55:06] here today that wouldn't hear from you
[55:09] Lord amen father if there is any
[55:11] unbelief in our midst we just rebuke it
[55:13] in the name of Jesus and we invite it to
[55:15] leave in the name of Jesus if there's
[55:18] any iniquity in our hearts Lord that
[55:20] would get in the way father Lord please
[55:22] take it from us Lord let this not be
[55:25] just an ordinary Sunday boring service
[55:28] Lord but let this be a gathering oh
[55:30] Father where we can hear from the king
[55:32] of kings and Lord of lords father let us
[55:35] not leave this building the same way
[55:36] that we came in but change our hearts oh

[55:53] you with Father we know that you know
[55:56] them
[55:56] you've given to them to us for a purpose
[55:59] you've allowed them to come to pass in

[56:59] this morning I would like to read from 2
[57:02] Corinthians chapter
[57:05] 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 very
[57:09] familiar scripture and we just trust
[57:12] that somehow some way the Lord will
[57:16] bless our meeting
[57:22] today 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[57:26] verse
[57:33] 9 and he said unto me my grace is
[57:37] sufficient for
[57:39] thee for my
[57:42] strength is made perfect in
[57:49] weakness most gladly
[57:51] therefore will I rather glory in my
[57:54] infirmities
[57:57] that the power of Christ May rest upon
[58:01] me therefore I take
[58:04] pleasure in
[58:08] infirmities in
[58:10] reproaches in
[58:12] Necessities in
[58:16] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[58:19] sake
[58:29] for when I'm weak then I am strong amen
[58:34] let's just
[58:36] bow gracious Heavenly
[58:39] Father Lord we have
[58:43] persecutions Lord Jesus we have
[58:47] distresses we have
[58:50] afflictions we have everything that's
[58:52] mentioned here in this scripture that we
[58:54] just read Lord
[58:56] and we know that that scripture was for
[58:58] Paul speaking about his life but we know
[59:01] that we need to see ourselves in every
[59:03] single
[59:04] scripture there was a time where we
[59:06] needed to see you in every single
[59:08] scripture and we do Lord but father we
[59:11] know that through progressive revelation
[59:14] we need to see ourselves in every
[59:16] scripture as well father because if
[59:19] you're in us then we're with you in
[59:22] every word and father we have these
[59:25] afflictions
[59:26] L father sometimes they're in our flesh
[59:29] sometimes they're in our
[59:31] minds sometimes Lord Jesus they're in
[59:34] our Spirits sometimes they're just from
[59:37] without other people attacking us father
[59:40] Yes Lord Lord Jesus we have these
[59:42] afflictions and we know they're for a
[59:44] purpose and that is so that your
[59:46] strength can be made perfect lord it's
[59:49] so that you can allow us father to come
[59:52] to that place where we recognize we have
[59:54] no strength where we recognize there's
[59:56] no control that we have over any
[59:59] situation in our lives and the only
[1:00:01] thing we have is you and Lord help us
[1:00:04] not to diminish Our Lives to the only
[1:00:06] thing we have is you but help us Lord
[1:00:09] Jesus to acknowledge that the only thing
[1:00:11] we have is you and everything else is
[1:00:13] secondary father Lord Jesus help us to
[1:00:17] recognize you in every single area every
[1:00:20] single facet of Our Lives Lord Jesus
[1:00:24] father we love you and we thank you and
[1:00:26] we just invite you father to have your
[1:00:28] perfect will and your perfect way in our
[1:00:31] lives father in our service this morning
[1:00:34] Lord we pray that you would just Lord oh
[1:00:36] Father brood over us as a hen does her
[1:00:39] chicks Lord Jesus that when we leave
[1:00:41] this building truly as we've already
[1:00:43] asked father that we would say you spoke
[1:00:45] to us as you walked with us along the
[1:00:47] way we love you and we thank you Father
[1:00:50] we just ask all these things now in
[1:00:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[1:00:55] God bless you this
[1:01:07] morning I guess maybe you might wonder
[1:01:10] why brother Barry's getting emotional I
[1:01:13] just can't help but read this scripture
[1:01:15] and I asked the Lord for something and
[1:01:17] this is what I believe he gave me and I
[1:01:18] just think it's wonderful
[1:01:20] because I guess
[1:01:23] maybe the more mature I get
[1:01:26] the more I recognize how weak I truly
[1:01:29] am and how little strength I really have
[1:01:33] and truly it's the Lord living out
[1:01:35] through me because I I could never do
[1:01:38] this I could never be who I am outside
[1:01:42] of the goodness of
[1:01:44] God in our scripture this morning Paul
[1:01:48] speaking we know that he's talking about
[1:01:51] his
[1:01:53] troubles and I guess before we get into
[1:01:55] that I'll just make sure we have uh
[1:01:57] couple of announcements here I apologize
[1:02:00] I get ahead of
[1:02:03] myself we have
[1:02:05] uh the 20th will be the uh October Youth
[1:02:10] Event and that will be brother Jerry Fox
[1:02:12] is coming from Edmonton end time message
[1:02:15] Tabernacle to do a little bit of a I
[1:02:17] guess a discussion on how the Lord has
[1:02:19] helped him in his life and how to
[1:02:22] prioritize Our Lives as young people so
[1:02:24] we're certainly excited to
[1:02:26] to hear from him that'll be on the 20th
[1:02:29] and then we have brother ciz atuan will
[1:02:32] take the service on the 27th before he
[1:02:34] departs to Toronto so we're certainly
[1:02:37] excited to uh have him as
[1:02:40] well and then uh one other announcement
[1:02:43] we have is that the neighbors who have
[1:02:45] been attending here for the last few
[1:02:47] years are planning to move to Edmonton
[1:02:49] and they will depart from Calgary on the
[1:02:52] 23rd of
[1:02:54] October and so we're certainly going to
[1:02:56] miss them and we wish God's richest
[1:02:59] blessings for them and for their family
[1:03:02] and we know that it's going to be for
[1:03:03] the best because they'll be closer to
[1:03:05] family on both sides and uh what a
[1:03:08] blessing it is and they'll be going to a
[1:03:10] wonderful church with a wonderful
[1:03:12] Ministry uh it's just a win-win except
[1:03:15] for
[1:03:16] us we'll have a bit of a loss but we
[1:03:19] know we'll all be together permanently
[1:03:22] one day and we certainly just want to
[1:03:24] invite you to shake their hand and say
[1:03:27] God bless you we uh didn't really have
[1:03:29] time to plan a a getaway uh appreciation
[1:03:33] for them as we desired but um Lord
[1:03:36] willing maybe we can do something in
[1:03:38] time maybe they'll be coming back again
[1:03:41] but it's just not going to work out to
[1:03:42] do something on the weekends before they
[1:03:44] go away so make sure you uh reach out to
[1:03:46] them and shake their hands and continue
[1:03:47] to pray for them moving is always a
[1:03:50] difficult thing and we just trust the
[1:03:51] Lord will continue to part the waters
[1:03:53] and open the doors and uh just help them
[1:03:56] along their way God richly bless you
[1:03:58] Sister Naomi and brother
[1:04:01] Levi if you uh are following me we are
[1:04:04] into 2 Corinthians chapter 12 this is
[1:04:08] Paul talking about the Lord's Grace how
[1:04:11] God showed him that his grace is
[1:04:13] sufficient for him and uh we know that
[1:04:17] if you go back in the scripture a little
[1:04:18] bit in uh chapter
[1:04:21] 12 Paul talking about how he was caught
[1:04:25] up into a a different realm and I can't
[1:04:26] help but think that maybe it was just a
[1:04:28] little bit like brother Bram he got to
[1:04:30] go and see beyond the curtain of time
[1:04:32] but only it wasn't time to talk about
[1:04:34] what he saw on the other side because we
[1:04:38] we know that uh he said he was caught up
[1:04:41] into paradise and he heard unspeakable
[1:04:43] words that which is not lawful for man
[1:04:46] to utter but yet there was a time we
[1:04:49] know where a man did go up into another
[1:04:53] heaven and he went beyond the curtain of
[1:04:54] time and was able to actually bring back
[1:04:58] word from that land and we know that the
[1:05:01] last words that he heard was keep
[1:05:03] pressing on and you know that's kind of
[1:05:06] where I want to get into today that's
[1:05:08] not going to be the title for today but
[1:05:11] I just think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:05:12] in verse six he says for though I would
[1:05:14] desire to Glory I shall not be a fool
[1:05:17] for I will say the truth and what a
[1:05:20] concept hey let us just speak the truth
[1:05:22] in love he goes on to say but now I
[1:05:25] forbear lest any man should think of me
[1:05:28] above that which he seeth me to be or
[1:05:31] that he heareth of me and we know the
[1:05:34] word of God says to not know any man
[1:05:38] after the flesh if we do that we are not
[1:05:42] following the word of God if we get a
[1:05:45] bee in our Bonnet or a bur in our saddle
[1:05:48] about another man or another woman we
[1:05:51] are not in the way of the word we're
[1:05:55] actually getting a little bit outside of
[1:05:57] the word we're beginning to transgress
[1:05:59] it we don't want to see anybody looking
[1:06:02] at anybody after the flesh verse 7 says
[1:06:06] and lest I should be exalted above
[1:06:09] measure through the abundance of the
[1:06:13] revelations God allowing this to happen
[1:06:17] abundance of Revelations there was given
[1:06:19] to me a thorn in the
[1:06:21] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[1:06:24] me I want to ask this morning how many
[1:06:26] people here experience that thorn in the
[1:06:30] flesh that messenger of Satan coming
[1:06:33] around to Buffet you if you're
[1:06:35] experiencing that you're being honest if
[1:06:38] you're not experiencing it I want to say
[1:06:40] today you're not being honest because as
[1:06:42] human beings Believers we're
[1:06:45] experiencing Satan coming around to
[1:06:47] Buffet us now you might say well brother
[1:06:50] Barry everything's good in my life I'm
[1:06:51] healthy I've got a good bank account the
[1:06:53] house is good the car is good the kids
[1:06:55] are good the wife is good everything is
[1:06:57] good is it I want to say is it good is
[1:07:01] it good spiritually if it is God bless
[1:07:03] you but we know the prophet said that if
[1:07:05] there's no battle there's a
[1:07:08] problem there's something
[1:07:11] wrong because that's the way we're
[1:07:12] created we're going to be buffeted we're
[1:07:15] going to be buffeted for a reason and
[1:07:17] that is so that his character can come
[1:07:19] out in us we know that brother bam
[1:07:21] talked about how the the the Native
[1:07:23] Americans for the proper terminology
[1:07:26] once upon a time they would take gold
[1:07:28] and they wouldn't smelt it they wouldn't
[1:07:29] melt it down to refine it what would
[1:07:31] they do to it they would fold it and
[1:07:34] they would beat it and fold it and beat
[1:07:36] it and fold it and beat it and when
[1:07:38] would they
[1:07:39] stop the prophet said when they would
[1:07:42] begin to see their own image reflecting
[1:07:44] back in it it's no accident the prophet
[1:07:47] chose to bring that as an example if
[1:07:49] we're being buffeted it's so that he can
[1:07:52] see his image reflecting back in us to
[1:07:59] him and lest I should be exalted above
[1:08:02] measure through the abundance of the
[1:08:04] revelations there was given me a thorn
[1:08:06] in the flesh the messenger of Satan to
[1:08:09] Buffet me lest I should be exalted above
[1:08:12] measure for this thing I besought the
[1:08:14] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[1:08:18] the first church age messenger Lord take
[1:08:20] it away from me please Lord take this
[1:08:24] away from me but isn't it interesting
[1:08:27] that he came back excuse me he came back
[1:08:30] with verse n and God's response to him
[1:08:34] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[1:08:37] for thee my for my strength is made
[1:08:41] perfect in weakness my strength is made
[1:08:43] perfect when you recognize how weak you
[1:08:45] really are how you can't stop Satan from
[1:08:48] buffeting you but you can respond to how
[1:08:51] Satan is buffeting you you can have joy
[1:08:54] amidst all your
[1:08:55] trials and we know that that's what's
[1:08:58] going to put Satan in a position where
[1:09:00] he won't even know what to do with us
[1:09:02] because whether we're up we're happy and
[1:09:04] we're praising and whether we're down
[1:09:05] we're happy and we're praising all we're
[1:09:08] doing is praising that's what we're
[1:09:10] going to do one day is just praise and
[1:09:12] worship that's it therefore I take
[1:09:15] pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in
[1:09:17] necessities and persecutions who does
[1:09:21] that I want to say that who does that
[1:09:23] who takes pleasure in infirmities in
[1:09:25] sickness in our bodies who who takes
[1:09:27] pleasure in reproaches people that will
[1:09:29] do things to us step on our toes who
[1:09:31] takes pleasure in that who takes
[1:09:33] pleasure in Necessities I don't have
[1:09:35] enough food to feed the children I don't
[1:09:37] have enough money in the bank account to
[1:09:39] pay the bills who takes pleasure in
[1:09:42] that or in persecutions
[1:09:45] my but it's when we're weak brothers and
[1:09:48] sisters that's when he's made strong and
[1:09:51] when we're stepping up to the Forefront
[1:09:52] and saying look at me whoa What a Mighty
[1:09:56] Kingdom I've created I've got my
[1:09:58] investments I've got my rsps and I've
[1:10:01] got my my esps or whatever you want to
[1:10:04] call them I've got all the Investments
[1:10:06] maybe the 401ks or whatever they are
[1:10:08] when we've created our own little
[1:10:10] kingdoms he can't help
[1:10:12] us and you know what to be clear
[1:10:15] sometimes the financial Empires that we
[1:10:17] can create here on this side are not a
[1:10:20] blessing of God they become entrapments
[1:10:23] to us because we have created something
[1:10:25] that now consumes us if we're not
[1:10:29] careful but we've got to make sure that
[1:10:31] we know exactly where we stand so long
[1:10:33] as we're putting him first in every
[1:10:34] single thing it's not an
[1:10:37] entrapment I'm not going to throw off on
[1:10:40] anybody that's doing anything good with
[1:10:42] their lives that has a a business or
[1:10:44] whatever I know what it takes to run a
[1:10:45] business and it's not easy it takes a
[1:10:47] lot of energy but God will bless that
[1:10:49] business when we put him first when we
[1:10:52] put him first in everything in every
[1:10:54] area of Our Lives
[1:10:55] He blesses us beyond what we ever
[1:10:57] imagine he would bless us with and
[1:11:00] that's just the way he
[1:11:02] is but his strength is perfect and
[1:11:05] that's what I want to title today his
[1:11:07] strength is perfect our strength is
[1:11:11] corrupt our strength is crooked our
[1:11:15] strength is unbalanced our strength is
[1:11:18] going to get us into trouble when we
[1:11:20] start trying to operate in this life as
[1:11:23] Believers of this message Accord
[1:11:25] according to our strength we are in big
[1:11:29] trouble we're in big trouble because
[1:11:32] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:11:34] their strength right but his strength is
[1:11:37] made perfect in our weakness it just
[1:11:40] really spoke to me uh as I was thinking
[1:11:43] about this as I was pondering this we
[1:11:46] were having a discussion over the
[1:11:47] weekend we went up to Edmonton
[1:11:50] yesterday actually that's not true we
[1:11:51] came back from Edon yesterday we went up
[1:11:53] on Friday night and we went to the the
[1:11:55] The Men's breakfast and we heard brother
[1:11:58] Alistair uh Francis he spoke brother
[1:12:02] Jeff Fair he spoke and uh our dear
[1:12:06] brother Jeff Paige he spoke as well he
[1:12:09] could be a preacher you
[1:12:12] know we all are preachers aren't we
[1:12:15] we're written Epistles read of all
[1:12:17] men but each one brought of their sacred
[1:12:20] portion yesterday and uh what a
[1:12:22] tremendous tremendous time it was uh I
[1:12:25] hate to say it but I'm going to those
[1:12:27] who didn't come you missed out it was it
[1:12:30] was a really good opportunity just to
[1:12:31] Fellowship we just had a quick
[1:12:32] fellowship and then we left and uh
[1:12:35] brother Toby and brother faren and
[1:12:37] families are still up there they went
[1:12:38] for the weekend but it would have been
[1:12:40] nice to stick around but it was just
[1:12:41] wonderful to to to fellowship with the
[1:12:44] Brethren and and to hear you know that
[1:12:46] we're all
[1:12:47] human there's nobody that's perfect in
[1:12:50] our midst and uh you know we all have
[1:12:53] struggles and the struggles that we have
[1:12:55] are are normal they're human
[1:12:57] struggles but many times they're just
[1:12:59] not talked about and I think that's the
[1:13:02] most amazing thing and uh for those
[1:13:04] people who did listen I put it out there
[1:13:06] on the men's chat I highly recommend
[1:13:08] listening to it it's probably going to
[1:13:10] be come a bit of a discussion for us as
[1:13:13] we go forwards uh with the men because
[1:13:15] you know if we're not willing to talk
[1:13:17] about the problems that we have in our
[1:13:19] lives then we're going to have
[1:13:21] situations where there's no Deliverance
[1:13:23] for the problems in our lives we're
[1:13:25] going to suffer alone and we're going to
[1:13:26] think that we're alone we're excluded
[1:13:28] the nobody else knows what our problems
[1:13:30] are nobody else knows what our struggles
[1:13:32] are but that's what the devil wants the
[1:13:33] devil wants to isolate us he wants to
[1:13:35] separate us he wants to divide us and
[1:13:37] then conquer us but if we won't do that
[1:13:40] if we won't allow him to do that if
[1:13:41] we'll make sure that he knows that we
[1:13:43] are united and that we're not afraid to
[1:13:45] call out a devil because an exposed
[1:13:47] Devil is a what it's a defeated devil
[1:13:51] but when we don't confess our faults one
[1:13:52] to another and pray for one another
[1:13:54] guess what's going to happen we're not
[1:13:55] going to be healed right we're going to
[1:13:58] just make room for the devil all over
[1:13:59] the place and we're not interested in
[1:14:01] giving him any room no room no more than
[1:14:04] what the Lord will allow and that's the
[1:14:06] only reason we have afflictions from the
[1:14:07] Devil is because the Lord allows it but
[1:14:10] he's also given us an overcoming power
[1:14:13] he's also given us his holy spirit the
[1:14:15] ability to overcome not to be defeated
[1:14:17] not to be slapped around his strength is
[1:14:21] made perfect and I think that's just a
[1:14:24] beautiful thing our strength is perfect
[1:14:26] in our weakness his strength is perfect
[1:14:28] in our weakness you know I just was
[1:14:31] thinking about this you know as I was
[1:14:33] studying this here his strength is made
[1:14:35] perfect and and the idea I'm going to
[1:14:38] get into this a little bit I'll probably
[1:14:40] get into it a lot more as we go forwards
[1:14:42] but the idea of progressive revelation
[1:14:45] how wonderful it is isn't it that once
[1:14:48] upon a time we we knew the word of God
[1:14:51] and and we had a whole bunch of loose
[1:14:53] ends in the word word of God there was
[1:14:56] things that weren't explained there was
[1:14:57] seals that were sealed up for many many
[1:15:00] generations thousands of years and there
[1:15:04] was a time where those seals were opened
[1:15:06] we know that we believe that we believe
[1:15:07] God sent a prophet that all seven seals
[1:15:10] are open there's some people that want
[1:15:11] to believe that six seals are open and I
[1:15:14] personally believe you have to struggle
[1:15:15] to believe that only six seals are open
[1:15:18] but
[1:15:19] hey the majority I think of the people
[1:15:21] who believe this message of the hour
[1:15:23] will say that all Seven Seals are open
[1:15:26] because the way the Scrolls were written
[1:15:28] the seven Seal closes all of them amen
[1:15:31] that's the last one you can't open and
[1:15:33] get to the first one without opening the
[1:15:35] seventh
[1:15:36] one it's the seventh one that opens all
[1:15:39] other
[1:15:40] six but his strength is made perfect and
[1:15:43] I can't help but think about this idea
[1:15:44] of progressive revelation and how you
[1:15:46] know 60 years ago the prophet was here
[1:15:49] standing on Earth saying there won't be
[1:15:50] two of us standing here at the same time
[1:15:53] it will either be him or it will be me
[1:15:55] there won't be two of us here and we
[1:15:57] know that God called The Prophet off the
[1:15:59] scene so we can say look you know we
[1:16:01] know that the Revelation has gone just a
[1:16:03] little bit further not further than the
[1:16:05] word that was got brought To Us by the
[1:16:07] prophet that's a perfect word but what
[1:16:09] happens is that word begins to perfect
[1:16:11] the people amen and if it doesn't
[1:16:14] there's something wrong and there's
[1:16:16] nothing wrong with the word there's
[1:16:18] nothing wrong with that word that was
[1:16:20] brought by the Vindicated Prophet what
[1:16:22] it is is distractions of the devil
[1:16:24] people trying to live under their own
[1:16:26] strength having a head knowledge about
[1:16:28] the word of God having a head knowledge
[1:16:31] about the message of the hour but not
[1:16:33] able to actually come to the knowledge
[1:16:35] of the truth entirely because if we come
[1:16:37] to the truth the knowledge of the truth
[1:16:39] entirely what happens is we come
[1:16:41] according to the word we get the baptism
[1:16:42] of the Holy Ghost when we get the
[1:16:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost he the spirit
[1:16:46] of Truth begins to live out and teach us
[1:16:49] how to
[1:16:51] live talking about this progressive
[1:16:54] revelation
[1:16:55] just thinking about the book of
[1:16:57] Ephesians we'll probably get into it a
[1:16:59] little bit later here but just how we
[1:17:01] have this idea of progressive revelation
[1:17:03] but yet sometimes you still hear people
[1:17:05] saying that you know the husbands
[1:17:07] they're supposed to just have their
[1:17:08] wives submit to them and that's what the
[1:17:11] word of God says and we know that it's
[1:17:12] been preached I heard it when I first
[1:17:14] time I heard this I was amazed because
[1:17:16] it's not with conditions the wives are
[1:17:19] supposed to submit to their husbands
[1:17:21] according to the word of God
[1:17:23] period but the husbands are supposed to
[1:17:25] love their wives according to the word
[1:17:28] of God exactly the way that Christ loved
[1:17:30] the church where he would give his
[1:17:31] entire life for his
[1:17:34] bride so where do we stand today as
[1:17:37] husbands and wives not just according to
[1:17:40] the word not just according to a
[1:17:41] tradition one one way maybe that was
[1:17:43] taught a few years ago that was maybe a
[1:17:45] little bit legalistic where we could
[1:17:47] just say submit and the woman would
[1:17:48] submit because everyone in a message
[1:17:49] Church would just do what they're
[1:17:50] they're doing and and we all behave the
[1:17:52] same way but where are we today
[1:17:54] according to this Progressive
[1:17:56] Revelations progressive revelation about
[1:17:58] the all the Seven Seals being open about
[1:18:00] all the mystery of God being finished
[1:18:02] that we understand there's an invisible
[1:18:04] Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:18:06] want to say there is indeed an invisible
[1:18:09] Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:18:11] that invisible Union causes a physical
[1:18:13] manifestation that is
[1:18:16] visible and it's not contrary to the
[1:18:18] word of
[1:18:19] God it's not contrary to the word of God
[1:18:22] it is not an invisible Union of the
[1:18:24] Bride of Jesus Christ when she is one
[1:18:27] with him she lives her life according to
[1:18:30] the word of God the husband loves his
[1:18:33] wife at all costs and understands that
[1:18:37] he is responsible for all of it for the
[1:18:40] wife for her behavior for the house for
[1:18:43] the children all of it rests on his
[1:18:46] shoulders and we know that in the Garden
[1:18:48] of Eden God didn't come down and say hey
[1:18:51] Cain or Abel Where Art Thou
[1:18:55] he didn't come down and say Eve what's
[1:18:57] going on with your husband he came down
[1:19:00] and said Adam where are you because Adam
[1:19:02] the man is responsible for all of
[1:19:05] it so when our wives are acting up when
[1:19:08] our our situations are going a little
[1:19:10] bit
[1:19:10] arai it's not her
[1:19:15] brother where do we stand with the verse
[1:19:17] verses in Ephesians 5:21 according to
[1:19:20] Progressive Revelations not tradition
[1:19:23] don't look at tradition don't don't look
[1:19:25] at the theories of the past we know
[1:19:26] there was an age where it was all
[1:19:28] legalism maybe not all I should back up
[1:19:31] on that mostly legalism and people were
[1:19:34] taught that their behavior the way they
[1:19:36] acted was going to reflect their
[1:19:38] Revelation according to the word of God
[1:19:41] and and that's CA
[1:19:43] Catholicism it's tradition that Creeps
[1:19:45] in to the message and we know that that
[1:19:47] spirit will be around because the word
[1:19:49] of God says that it will creep into the
[1:19:51] brother bradam said it that it will
[1:19:52] creep into the framework of the
[1:19:54] Christian church
[1:19:55] that that lukewarm formal and
[1:19:57] powerlessness it will happen but the
[1:20:00] only reason it happens is because people
[1:20:01] are trying to do it on their own
[1:20:03] strength if we are willing to surrender
[1:20:06] ourselves to submit ourselves verse 21
[1:20:08] of Ephesians chapter 5 submitting
[1:20:10] ourselves
[1:20:12] therefore one to another in the fear of
[1:20:15] God so long as we're willing to do that
[1:20:17] then all the rest of the verses can
[1:20:19] actually be activated but when we're
[1:20:21] willing to just simply say no I'm the
[1:20:22] Man submit to me or or or I'm the wife
[1:20:26] and and it's supposed to be this way or
[1:20:28] it's not going to work it's going to
[1:20:31] ground the effects of the word of God
[1:20:34] you know in
[1:20:37] uh
[1:20:43] my
[1:20:44] Psalms
[1:20:46] 37 verse
[1:20:49] 1 Psalms 37 verse1 a Psalm of David
[1:20:56] fret not thyself because of
[1:20:58] evildoers neither be thou envious
[1:21:01] against the workers of iniquity don't be
[1:21:03] looking around this
[1:21:05] world for they shall soon be cut down
[1:21:07] like grass and wither as the green herb
[1:21:11] I just can't help but think that this
[1:21:13] just can bring so much consolation for
[1:21:16] us when we look around in this world and
[1:21:17] see how maybe other people have things
[1:21:20] easier naturally speaking in their lives
[1:21:22] maybe they have health maybe they have
[1:21:24] wealth maybe they've got just things
[1:21:26] seem to be fine with them there's never
[1:21:28] any problems in their life everything
[1:21:29] they set out to do just happens every we
[1:21:31] know the world says sometimes people
[1:21:33] just have What's called the mest touch
[1:21:35] everything that happens in their life is
[1:21:37] just so easy and Flowery from the
[1:21:39] outside but there's always stuff going
[1:21:42] on behind the
[1:21:44] scenes but those people Naturally
[1:21:46] Speaking they shall soon be cut down
[1:21:48] like grass and wither as the green herb
[1:21:50] verse three says trust in the Lord and
[1:21:52] do good just trust in in the Lord and do
[1:21:55] good don't don't worry about all of the
[1:21:57] other stuff we see going on in the world
[1:22:00] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[1:22:03] verily Thou shalt be fed once upon a
[1:22:06] time we would look at this scripture and
[1:22:07] say thou shalt dwell in the land we'll
[1:22:09] dwell in the promised land we can travel
[1:22:11] to the promised land we can travel to a
[1:22:12] place that we buy maybe a a piece of
[1:22:15] land and we'll be able to dwell in our
[1:22:17] land on Earth but as progress of
[1:22:19] Revelation takes over according to the
[1:22:20] message of the hour we're not looking at
[1:22:22] that land as being a natural place it's
[1:22:25] not a geographical location it is the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost In Our Lives we shall dwell
[1:22:31] in the land and verily truly Thou shalt
[1:22:35] be fed that's what that word verily
[1:22:37] means truly Thou shalt be fed Delight
[1:22:41] thyself also in the Lord and He Shall
[1:22:44] give Thee the desires of thine
[1:22:47] heart seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:22:51] brothers and sisters in every single
[1:22:53] decision every single area every single
[1:22:55] action we know that the word of God says
[1:22:58] that we should do everything in word and
[1:23:01] deed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:03] Christ and if we can't do that then we
[1:23:05] should not do it right the prophet said
[1:23:08] that if you got any questions about
[1:23:09] anything just don't do it Delight
[1:23:12] thyself also in the Lord and He Shall
[1:23:15] give Thee the desires of thine heart he
[1:23:17] will Way Beyond what we can
[1:23:20] imagine commit thy way unto the Lord why
[1:23:26] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[1:23:28] to pass and he shall bring forth thy
[1:23:31] righteousness as the light and thy
[1:23:34] judgment as the Noonday rest in the Lord
[1:23:37] wait patiently for him fret not thyself
[1:23:40] because of him who prospereth in his way
[1:23:43] because of the man who bringeth Wicked
[1:23:45] devices to
[1:23:47] pass here's what I want to get to about
[1:23:50] this fretting stuff that happens cease
[1:23:53] from anger if we're getting angry in our
[1:23:55] lives brothers and sisters that's
[1:23:57] contrary to the word of God the word
[1:24:00] says cease from anger and you might
[1:24:02] thinkk brother Barry who you talking to
[1:24:04] here I'm talking to
[1:24:05] me brother
[1:24:07] Barry cease from anger that's what I'm
[1:24:11] saying cease from anger stop getting mad
[1:24:14] about things in my life and forsake
[1:24:18] wrath forsake that idea that I'm going
[1:24:22] to deal with that situation yeah it's
[1:24:23] coming up man I'm going to I'm going to
[1:24:25] get after it I'm going to get it done
[1:24:28] we're going to have a conversation
[1:24:30] something's going to change because I'm
[1:24:31] angry about this that's not the word of
[1:24:34] God it says cease from anger and forsake
[1:24:36] wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do
[1:24:42] evil now let's just clarify this evil
[1:24:46] anything contrary to the word of God is
[1:24:49] evil evil isn't taking a baseball bat
[1:24:52] and wrapping something really sharp
[1:24:53] around it and thinking you're going to
[1:24:55] go and solve problems right we're not
[1:24:57] talking about evil maybe even it can be
[1:25:00] as simple as speaking something that's
[1:25:02] contrary to the word of God there's good
[1:25:06] and there's evil remember we were
[1:25:09] talking about this a little while ago
[1:25:11] there is no such thing as a little white
[1:25:15] lie if it's a lie it's a big black stain
[1:25:19] on our lives there's good there's evil
[1:25:22] there's right there's wrong that that's
[1:25:24] it there's no gray areas and that's one
[1:25:26] of the things the devil has specialized
[1:25:28] in our days to try and make a a gray
[1:25:30] smear let's talk about it well you know
[1:25:33] I really said it this way and and it was
[1:25:35] only meant like that you know what we're
[1:25:37] either telling the truth or we're
[1:25:38] telling a lie flat
[1:25:41] out and as soon as we're telling a lie a
[1:25:44] little teeny one it could sound a little
[1:25:46] bit like something and maybe we can
[1:25:48] constru it I really meant it that way
[1:25:50] did you God knows how you meant it God
[1:25:52] knows exactly how you meant it if we
[1:25:54] have a lying spirit it's a spirit ask
[1:25:59] God to take it out of the way and he
[1:26:00] will to bring it to our remembrance to
[1:26:03] say Lord help me not
[1:26:06] lie and you know what every one of us
[1:26:10] how many in here has never told a
[1:26:13] lie none of us can put our hand up
[1:26:16] because how many of us were not born in
[1:26:18] sin come on raise your hand who wasn't
[1:26:20] born in sin
[1:26:24] shaped in iniquity every one of us born
[1:26:28] in sin shaped in iniquity we come into
[1:26:29] the world speaking lies I'll never
[1:26:31] forget my pastor saying it children you
[1:26:34] don't even have to give them the
[1:26:35] opportunity to learn how to lie they
[1:26:38] just know how that's because of the word
[1:26:41] of God it's because of the hybrid
[1:26:42] condition we have Cain's DNA inside of
[1:26:45] us I'm sorry that's why the prophet of
[1:26:48] God said to reject to resist the baptism
[1:26:52] of the Holy Ghost in our lives means you
[1:26:55] already have the mark of the
[1:26:57] beast you don't have to go and get a
[1:27:00] chip in your hand you don't have to get
[1:27:02] something in your forehead we had the
[1:27:04] prophet teach very clearly that that
[1:27:07] Mark in the hand is the action toward
[1:27:10] sin a and the thought in the forehead is
[1:27:13] what causes the hand to move that is the
[1:27:15] mark of the
[1:27:16] beast when we're acting out of our own
[1:27:22] will evildoers shall be cut off and they
[1:27:26] will be oh my but those that wait upon
[1:27:30] the Lord they shall inherit the earth
[1:27:33] those that wait upon the Lord are we
[1:27:35] waiting upon the Lord or are we quick to
[1:27:37] wrath quick I got a I got a hair trigger
[1:27:41] temper on me I got a buzza that's in my
[1:27:44] backpack just just you try me and see if
[1:27:47] that's how we are we're contrary to the
[1:27:49] word and all we need to do is line up
[1:27:52] with the word
[1:27:54] let's turn over to Acts chapter
[1:28:02] 9 Acts chapter
[1:28:07] n just want to talk a little bit about
[1:28:18] Paul before he was Paul he had a nature
[1:28:22] didn't he he had a nature nature that
[1:28:24] had to change he couldn't Remain the guy
[1:28:27] he was and be who God wanted him to
[1:28:31] be he didn't just have a name change did
[1:28:34] he and you know sometimes brother bradam
[1:28:37] says it I if we're just trying to live
[1:28:40] this message if we're just trying to be
[1:28:42] a Christian if we're just trying to live
[1:28:45] a good personal life we're an
[1:28:47] impersonator of
[1:28:49] Christianity we'll get into that quote
[1:28:51] later but Paul the Apostle for the age
[1:28:54] the very first church age the one who
[1:28:56] actually set the pattern for all other
[1:28:58] Church ages we've learned as we've been
[1:29:00] studying the exposition of the seven
[1:29:02] Church ages he says here in verse one of
[1:29:05] chapter n acts and Saul yet breathing
[1:29:08] out threatenings and Slaughter against
[1:29:11] the Disciples of the Lord went unto the
[1:29:14] high priest and desired him letters to
[1:29:16] Damascus to the synagogues that if he
[1:29:18] found any of this way whether they were
[1:29:22] men or women he might bring them bound
[1:29:25] unto
[1:29:26] Jerusalem and we know that he wasn't he
[1:29:29] wasn't very good to these people he was
[1:29:32] breathing out Slaughter he was breathing
[1:29:34] out persecution for these people and as
[1:29:38] he journeyed verse three he came near
[1:29:40] Damascus and suddenly there shined round
[1:29:44] about him a light from heaven and what
[1:29:47] happened when that light sha round about
[1:29:49] him he fell to the Earth and heard a
[1:29:53] voice saying unto him him Saul Saul why
[1:29:55] persecutest thou
[1:29:57] me it's just beautiful because the next
[1:30:00] verse he says Paul Saul speaking he said
[1:30:03] who art thou
[1:30:05] Lord he knew who he was who art thou
[1:30:11] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[1:30:14] thou
[1:30:16] persecutest I am Jesus whom thou
[1:30:20] persecutest it's hard for thee to kick
[1:30:22] against the pricks
[1:30:25] and he trembled and astonished said Lord
[1:30:28] What wilt thou have me to do and the
[1:30:30] Lord said unto him arise and go into
[1:30:32] this city and it shall be told thee what
[1:30:34] thou must do and the men which journeyed
[1:30:37] with him stood
[1:30:39] speechless hearing a voice but seeing no
[1:30:43] man and Saul arose from the earth and
[1:30:46] when his eyes were open he saw no man
[1:30:49] but they led him by the hand and brought
[1:30:51] him into Damascus and we know that he
[1:30:54] was there for three days he was there
[1:30:57] blind he didn't
[1:30:59] eat he probably had very little to drink
[1:31:02] he might not even have drank at all but
[1:31:04] here he sat wondering what what was
[1:31:08] going to happen to him what actually
[1:31:10] happened to him who really was it that
[1:31:12] he called lord who who is this Jesus
[1:31:16] whom he is persecuting he must have had
[1:31:18] all manner of thoughts and I just
[1:31:20] couldn't help but think you know what
[1:31:21] brothers and sisters when we truly hear
[1:31:23] that that voice for ourselves in our own
[1:31:26] lives when it's not someone else's
[1:31:29] experience that they're trying to thrust
[1:31:30] upon us what what it is is is it's a
[1:31:33] name changing voice it is a lifegiving
[1:31:37] voice it is that Pillar of Fire that
[1:31:39] brother bradam said I can see it now
[1:31:42] it's it's hovering over those people up
[1:31:44] in the balcony and I can see it it's
[1:31:46] moving around it's over that man over
[1:31:48] there in the back don't miss it now and
[1:31:50] he would start to call out all of the
[1:31:52] things going on in their lives the same
[1:31:54] thing as the woman at the well come and
[1:31:55] see a man who told me the things that
[1:31:57] I've done it was only the spirit of God
[1:31:59] but it was that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:32:01] came and met Saul on his way to
[1:32:04] persecute but that that Pillar of Fire
[1:32:06] wasn't there to actually harm him that
[1:32:09] Pillar of Fire was there to give him a
[1:32:10] new name to change his name but not just
[1:32:13] change his name to change his nature we
[1:32:16] know this man had a new birth experience
[1:32:19] right there and once he actually went
[1:32:21] into the city God worked on the other
[1:32:23] end just like he does now he's the same
[1:32:25] yesterday today and forever he's not
[1:32:27] going to work just on one end he always
[1:32:29] works on both
[1:32:31] ends he told the man
[1:32:34] ananas I've got this guy right where I
[1:32:37] want him and I want you to go pray for
[1:32:39] him now isn't it interesting because God
[1:32:41] could have just gone and done it he
[1:32:43] could have gone down he could have just
[1:32:45] picked up all the different elements
[1:32:47] like brother bradam talked about and
[1:32:48] just created a body and stepped into it
[1:32:51] and went right down there and actually
[1:32:52] did it but what did did he do he took
[1:32:55] someone who was in position someone who
[1:32:57] was praying someone was in in their
[1:33:00] position with the Lord who knew where he
[1:33:02] stood with the gospel and what did he do
[1:33:04] he used that individual to now go and
[1:33:07] pray for the other individual we heard
[1:33:10] about it yesterday sometimes we have
[1:33:11] experiences in our lives where we we we
[1:33:16] ourselves understand the situation but
[1:33:18] there's other times where other people
[1:33:20] have experiences in their lives and and
[1:33:22] the way those experiences are we just
[1:33:24] can't relate to them because we've never
[1:33:26] gone through those experiences but that
[1:33:28] other person they can relate with other
[1:33:30] people who have gone through those very
[1:33:33] same experiences and situations and
[1:33:36] those are the people that God will take
[1:33:37] and use to go and pray for other people
[1:33:40] to be able to reach the other people and
[1:33:43] that's exactly what happened here when
[1:33:45] he went into Damascus he thought he was
[1:33:47] going into persecute but he actually got
[1:33:50] a name change he got a nature change
[1:33:52] more than just a change and I think it's
[1:33:55] so beautiful because it was right there
[1:33:57] that he was able to understand that his
[1:33:59] strength is made perfect in his weakness
[1:34:03] I can't help but think our scripture
[1:34:05] this morning out of second Corinthians
[1:34:07] Paul was going right back to that moment
[1:34:09] where he was high on his horse wasn't he
[1:34:11] and God came around and sha that Pillar
[1:34:13] of Fire on him and showed you know what
[1:34:16] without me you're
[1:34:19] nothing he had to put him right to the
[1:34:21] ground to say look look up son look up
[1:34:25] and we know that he couldn't see
[1:34:27] anything after that it's interesting all
[1:34:29] of the different types that are in there
[1:34:31] but I just want to carry on a little bit
[1:34:33] and think that you know immediately
[1:34:35] Verse 18 immediately there fell from his
[1:34:38] eyes as it had been scales and he
[1:34:40] received sight forth with and arose and
[1:34:43] what he was baptized he was willing to
[1:34:46] take that word and apply it in his own
[1:34:48] life he understood what needed to happen
[1:34:50] at that point I just can't help but
[1:34:52] think that he already knew it too but he
[1:34:55] received the Holy Ghost when annias went
[1:34:57] and prayed for him he followed the word
[1:34:59] of the lord we know that an ananas must
[1:35:01] have been very much afraid to go in
[1:35:03] there to see this one who had been
[1:35:05] laying waste the Church of the Living
[1:35:07] God he he had Steven stoned he was the
[1:35:11] one that was just coming in to start
[1:35:13] destroying people taking prisoners back
[1:35:15] to Jerusalem and yet God called him to
[1:35:18] go and pray for this man we need to know
[1:35:20] exactly where we stand brothers and
[1:35:21] sisters when we go on our knees and we
[1:35:23] hear voice we need to make sure we know
[1:35:26] that it's the Lord Matthew chapter 7 you
[1:35:29] know we know I think it's beautiful that
[1:35:32] he was told ananas was told go arise and
[1:35:36] go into the street which is called
[1:35:38] straight and inquire in the house of
[1:35:40] Judas for one called Saul gave him the
[1:35:43] exact instructions didn't he it's just
[1:35:46] exactly out of Matthew chapter 7 enter
[1:35:48] ye in at the Straight Gate don't just go
[1:35:52] anywhere I want you to to go to the
[1:35:54] Straight Gate for wide is the gate and
[1:35:56] Broad is the way that leadth to
[1:35:58] destruction that is what this whole
[1:36:00] world is going towards it's a big wide
[1:36:03] gate you can get to heaven all these
[1:36:06] manner of ways all these different ways
[1:36:09] religions and and and peoples and ideas
[1:36:13] we know we serve a mighty God that's
[1:36:14] what this world is propagating but we
[1:36:17] know we had a prophet in our day that
[1:36:18] said no way there's only one truth
[1:36:22] there's only one life and that that that
[1:36:25] truth and that life who is our way he is
[1:36:27] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:36:29] he's only exactly according to his word
[1:36:32] and that's what Satan hates but you know
[1:36:35] this man was told enter ye in at the
[1:36:37] Straight Gate get down there to that
[1:36:39] that street which is called straight and
[1:36:41] inquire at the house of Judas for one
[1:36:43] called Saul of Tarsus for behold he
[1:36:48] prayeth it's beautiful he must have been
[1:36:50] praying saying I don't even know who I
[1:36:52] am anymore I don't even know what's
[1:36:54] going on what happened to me back there
[1:36:56] I got knocked off my high horse and I
[1:36:58] can't help but think brothers and
[1:36:59] sisters that is exactly the same way it
[1:37:02] is when we have a new birth experience
[1:37:05] we're not the same person something
[1:37:07] happens inside of us people around us
[1:37:10] will say who are you and what have you
[1:37:12] done with brother so and
[1:37:14] so it's not it's not a joke it's real
[1:37:18] the prophet said a real New Birth is
[1:37:20] messy it's not just a pleasant thing
[1:37:23] it's not just is something that we say
[1:37:25] it's it's not a big thing you know we
[1:37:28] know that verse 14 here of of Matthew
[1:37:30] chapter 7 it says because straight is
[1:37:32] the gate and narrow is the way which
[1:37:33] leadth unto life and few there be that
[1:37:37] find it I want to say today if you can
[1:37:39] understand the message of the hour if
[1:37:41] you have the ability to hear the word
[1:37:44] that the spirit says to the church today
[1:37:47] you are one of those few you can sing
[1:37:50] that song I I I'm one of the few I'm so
[1:37:54] glad that I can say I'm one of them I I
[1:37:56] I know that not many people in this
[1:37:58] world will ever be able to understand
[1:38:00] this message let alone hear it and what
[1:38:03] is the percentage it's a percent of a
[1:38:06] percent out of 8 billion people in this
[1:38:09] world my we have the ability to just go
[1:38:11] on to eternal life
[1:38:15] whoa perfect strength by Perfect
[1:38:17] weakness
[1:38:20] 1961 just an amazing message by the way
[1:38:23] 122 brother batam says but God's side
[1:38:25] was weak and
[1:38:27] humble that's how God uses them that's
[1:38:30] God's
[1:38:32] opportunity that's God's way of getting
[1:38:34] to
[1:38:35] us when we're
[1:38:37] weak we get something then and I know
[1:38:41] myself I can speak plainly and and
[1:38:43] openly that many times I'll just be
[1:38:45] going along through life and maybe I'll
[1:38:47] start to go off on a little bit of a
[1:38:49] tangent I'll start to stray a little bit
[1:38:51] and God will just allow a little
[1:38:52] pressure to happen in brother Barry's
[1:38:54] life and that pressure comes around and
[1:38:57] immediately I start to consider my ways
[1:39:00] immediately I start to think Lord what
[1:39:02] what's going on what am I doing wrong
[1:39:03] what's what do you want you want to get
[1:39:05] my attention that's God's way it's God's
[1:39:07] way of getting to us when we're weak
[1:39:10] when we get something then this
[1:39:12] encourages of course because God's whole
[1:39:16] kingdom is built out of these kind of
[1:39:19] people isn't that beautiful then when
[1:39:22] you get to that kind of a way then you
[1:39:25] can you're you're in his
[1:39:28] kingdom I say Lord thank you for the
[1:39:31] persecutions thank you for the times you
[1:39:33] come and and allow me to go through
[1:39:36] something because it shows me that I'm
[1:39:37] in your
[1:39:38] kingdom he says the case is with us that
[1:39:42] we're not that we're too weak the cas is
[1:39:46] we're too
[1:39:48] strong we're just too strong that's all
[1:39:53] I love the way he goes even further with
[1:39:54] it he starts to talk about human nature
[1:39:56] here he says the thing of it is we're
[1:39:58] too stronge headed we're too stronge
[1:40:00] headed I I've done it this way my whole
[1:40:03] entire life there's nothing that you're
[1:40:04] ever going to tell me I I know all about
[1:40:06] the message of the hour there's nothing
[1:40:08] that you're ever going to say that's
[1:40:09] going to encourage me you know what
[1:40:11] we're living in a place where we're
[1:40:12] we're we're dealing with progressive
[1:40:14] revelation it's not about just staying
[1:40:16] back in 1964 or 1963 imagine if we just
[1:40:20] said no I just believe the message right
[1:40:22] up to 196 2 that's all none of the seals
[1:40:25] would be open for
[1:40:27] me it's
[1:40:29] Progressive it goes on and on he reveals
[1:40:32] himself on and on we know the prophet
[1:40:34] said that he's going to reveal himself
[1:40:35] to us throughout
[1:40:36] eternity we're going to only see parts
[1:40:39] of him in the
[1:40:40] beginning the case with us though is
[1:40:43] that we're just we're we're just a
[1:40:44] little too strong that's all the thing
[1:40:46] of it is we're too stronge headed that's
[1:40:48] right we're too strong in our head
[1:40:51] remember my strength is made
[1:40:54] perfect in
[1:40:57] weakness he says that's right we're too
[1:40:59] strong in our head we we know too much
[1:41:02] and when was there ever an age where we
[1:41:03] had so much information about the
[1:41:05] message of the
[1:41:07] hour God wants to get that out of us
[1:41:11] that's right we're too strong we're too
[1:41:14] strong to yield to him and I want to say
[1:41:17] today what the problem is from my
[1:41:19] perception is we're too strong to yield
[1:41:22] to a Ministry
[1:41:24] we get to the place where we say oh it's
[1:41:25] just brother so and so I know him I know
[1:41:28] his parents I know his lineage he's okay
[1:41:31] but I like this other minister over here
[1:41:33] or whatever that's what we do in our
[1:41:35] lives we're too strong we're too strong
[1:41:38] to yield to him we've got to yield
[1:41:41] ourselves got to think well now here I
[1:41:44] got sense enough to
[1:41:46] know you know I want to I want to talk a
[1:41:48] little bit about that how we can we can
[1:41:50] begin to have a little bit of a
[1:41:52] perception that way let's turn over to
[1:41:54] Philippians the book of Philippians is a
[1:41:57] wonderful book such an
[1:42:01] encouragement the book of
[1:42:15] Philippians
[1:42:17] Paul the messenger of the church age
[1:42:19] this was this is an example of maybe a
[1:42:22] little bit how he had a a personality
[1:42:26] change and I love the way he describes
[1:42:28] it here in in Chapter 3 of Philippians
[1:42:30] verse one says finally my brethren
[1:42:32] rejoice in the Lord to write the same
[1:42:35] things to you to me indeed is not
[1:42:37] Grievious but for you it is
[1:42:40] safe beware of dogs beware of evil
[1:42:44] workers Beware of the
[1:42:47] concision for we are the circumcision
[1:42:50] which worship God in spirit and re
[1:42:53] rejoice in Jesus Christ and have no
[1:42:55] confidence in the flesh and we know at
[1:42:57] that time there's a whole sect of people
[1:42:59] that were trying to say that unless we
[1:43:01] have the Covenant of Abraham in our
[1:43:04] flesh then then we're not Believers and
[1:43:06] he's preaching the New Covenant to him
[1:43:08] saying there's a new way you don't have
[1:43:10] to do it in your flesh you have to
[1:43:12] Humble your flesh and allow him to do it
[1:43:14] in your life he's already done it that's
[1:43:17] what he's preaching about here though I
[1:43:19] verse four though I might also have
[1:43:22] confidence in the the flesh if any other
[1:43:26] man thinketh that he hath whereof he
[1:43:29] might Trust In the Flesh I
[1:43:33] more circumcised the eighth day here he
[1:43:36] goes describing his life who he is this
[1:43:39] man Paul now with the name change not
[1:43:42] breathing out persecutions on the church
[1:43:44] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[1:43:46] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a
[1:43:49] Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law a
[1:43:52] Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the
[1:43:55] church the church touching the
[1:43:58] righteousness which is the in the law
[1:44:03] blameless to all outwardly experience or
[1:44:06] appearance this man was
[1:44:08] perfect he had everything going for him
[1:44:11] he was a message
[1:44:13] believer he came from message parents he
[1:44:16] went to a message church he had
[1:44:18] everything absolutely correct but what
[1:44:21] does he go on to say here in verse 7
[1:44:23] but what things were gained to me those
[1:44:27] things I counted lost for
[1:44:30] Christ because brothers and sisters you
[1:44:32] might say why are you talking about the
[1:44:34] message that way I want to say it this
[1:44:36] way the message was to bring people to
[1:44:38] Jesus Christ that's the purpose of the
[1:44:41] message the message isn't just to say
[1:44:43] that's the message that there's a
[1:44:46] messenger the message was to introduce
[1:44:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:44:52] Christ because the church church nominal
[1:44:56] had drifted away through denomination we
[1:44:58] were going through all of that in the
[1:44:59] exposition of the seven Church ages from
[1:45:02] this time that Paul was here as the
[1:45:03] first CH Church a messenger it didn't
[1:45:05] take very long for them in Ephesus to
[1:45:07] drift away from the word we know that
[1:45:09] we've studied it already but whatever
[1:45:12] things were gained to me I counted those
[1:45:15] things for loss for Christ verse 8 yay
[1:45:18] doubtless and I count all things but
[1:45:20] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:45:23] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:45:28] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:45:31] count them but what I count them but
[1:45:34] dung all those things that he just
[1:45:36] listed off my my personal position in my
[1:45:39] family my tenure in the message all the
[1:45:42] goodness that I've done all of the
[1:45:44] learning that I've had all the degrees
[1:45:46] that are on my wall all that I think
[1:45:48] that I am in my person are Dum
[1:45:53] why is that because he was no longer
[1:45:56] Saul of
[1:45:58] Tarsus he was Paul the Apostle he was
[1:46:01] the one that God created before the
[1:46:03] foundation of the world to be in his
[1:46:08] position he counted all them but dung
[1:46:11] that I may win
[1:46:14] Christ
[1:46:16] my and we know that that is the the
[1:46:19] acronym you just made me think about it
[1:46:20] I made me think about it someone made me
[1:46:22] think about it I believe the Lord did
[1:46:24] we'll say it that way the acronym Faith
[1:46:27] you know that acronym forsaking all
[1:46:33] I take him I'm actually getting it wrong
[1:46:37] but this is this is what the Apostle did
[1:46:40] he he forsook everything in his life all
[1:46:43] of his teaching everything that he
[1:46:45] thought he was his own righteousness and
[1:46:47] being found in him not having my own
[1:46:50] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:46:52] that which is through the Faith of
[1:46:55] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:46:58] by faith that I may know him and the
[1:47:02] power of his resurrection and you know
[1:47:04] brothers and sisters that is my prayer
[1:47:06] for every single one of us that we would
[1:47:09] know him in the power of his
[1:47:12] resurrection not just know him that he
[1:47:14] died on Calvary that we could have maybe
[1:47:17] a cross on the wall or or or some sort
[1:47:20] of an emblem or or or just something
[1:47:23] we're a part of that we would know that
[1:47:25] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:47:26] forever in our own lives and you know
[1:47:29] our children they need to see that the
[1:47:32] children in this congregation need to
[1:47:34] see a god with skin on they need to see
[1:47:37] that there is a living God but we need
[1:47:40] to know him Paul's saying that I may
[1:47:42] know him I just want to say read that
[1:47:45] and think your own name that I may know
[1:47:48] him and the power of his resurrection
[1:47:50] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:47:52] being made conformable unto his death if
[1:47:56] by any means I might attain to the
[1:47:58] resurrection of the dead that's what we
[1:48:01] have to do if we're going to attain to
[1:48:03] that resurrection that General
[1:48:05] Resurrection if that's going to happen
[1:48:07] verse 12 says not as though I had
[1:48:10] already
[1:48:11] attained we've never just arrived
[1:48:13] brothers and sisters as message
[1:48:15] Believers we're marching forward we're
[1:48:18] marching to Zion not as though I had
[1:48:20] already attained either we all already
[1:48:23] perfect but I follow
[1:48:26] after if that I may apprehend that for
[1:48:30] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[1:48:34] Jesus
[1:48:36] Remember You don't have to take it down
[1:48:38] brother you can leave it up there
[1:48:39] remember that he became a
[1:48:42] prisoner of Christ
[1:48:44] Jesus that means that he had no control
[1:48:47] over what he was going to do amen that
[1:48:50] meant that he had a master that was
[1:48:52] going to tell him what he was going to
[1:48:53] do he became a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:48:56] verse 13 He says Brethren I count not
[1:48:59] myself to have apprehended this is the
[1:49:02] Apostle of the age he counted himself as
[1:49:05] not making
[1:49:07] it I can't think myself as a Believer
[1:49:10] how we could ever think that we've made
[1:49:11] it we've never attained every single day
[1:49:14] as Paul said I Die
[1:49:17] daily we've got to Die daily if we can't
[1:49:20] die daily then there is a prideful
[1:49:22] Spirit trying to rise up inside of us
[1:49:25] and I want to say this I know we have
[1:49:27] pressures of life sometimes we don't get
[1:49:29] on our knees to pray uh let's be real
[1:49:31] sometimes we don't have the time
[1:49:33] sometimes we're tired sometimes the
[1:49:35] pressures of life sometimes we want to
[1:49:37] take a little time in prayer and we just
[1:49:39] can't because life is going to push us
[1:49:41] that's why we need to know that we've
[1:49:42] already
[1:49:44] prayed it's like that but let's be real
[1:49:47] we can't always pray we can't always Die
[1:49:49] daily we desire to do we desire to every
[1:49:53] day to see this old man die so that
[1:49:56] Christ could
[1:49:58] live Brethren I count myself not to have
[1:50:02] apprehended count not myself to have
[1:50:04] apprehended but this one thing I do this
[1:50:06] is I think the critical key this is the
[1:50:08] Nugget if I could impart anything to us
[1:50:11] today I want to put this out there and
[1:50:13] harp on this a little bit forgetting
[1:50:16] those things which are behind amen and
[1:50:19] reaching forth unto those things which
[1:50:21] are before
[1:50:23] I press towards the mark for the price
[1:50:25] of the High Calling of God in Christ
[1:50:27] Jesus now I want to say brothers and
[1:50:29] sisters where do we stand with the book
[1:50:30] of Ephesians are we willing to say that
[1:50:33] I've had a new experience like Paul has
[1:50:36] I'm not going to attain I'm never going
[1:50:38] to be a perfect husband but I sure want
[1:50:40] to be I sure want to try to be I sure
[1:50:43] want to line up with this word of God
[1:50:45] according to the book of Ephesians I
[1:50:47] want to give of myself for my wife and
[1:50:49] my family just like Christ did for the
[1:50:51] church I don't want to just simply say
[1:50:54] get in line woman children you better
[1:50:56] obey if you get out of line you're going
[1:50:58] to get a switch I got a few trees on the
[1:51:01] property we could go and peel back a
[1:51:02] nice one maybe the size of my thumb just
[1:51:04] a nice green one that'll Flex a lot I
[1:51:07] don't do that but I'm just saying
[1:51:09] there's people that could just take it
[1:51:11] and mix it up and say yeah that's what
[1:51:13] he's talking about no we're not abusive
[1:51:16] we don't abuse our children the word of
[1:51:18] God says spare the rod you'll spoil the
[1:51:20] child if you try to take and mix
[1:51:22] psycholog ol with this word you're not
[1:51:24] going to get the right
[1:51:28] results but to think about the things in
[1:51:30] our lives as husbands and wives even as
[1:51:34] children even as children we can look at
[1:51:36] our parents and think about my parents I
[1:51:38] could think about my dad and think you
[1:51:40] know I don't like the way that he did
[1:51:41] this and I don't like the way that he
[1:51:43] did that and because he did or didn't I
[1:51:45] have hurt in my life now I can talk
[1:51:48] about my life I'm not going to slam my
[1:51:51] dad I love my dad
[1:51:53] he did the best he could with what he
[1:51:54] had he actually took me to church he
[1:51:57] actually showed me that there is a
[1:52:01] redeemer he showed me that there is a
[1:52:04] way a truth and a life and you know as a
[1:52:07] child it wasn't according to the message
[1:52:08] of the hour but what's that got to do
[1:52:10] with me it was exactly what I needed for
[1:52:13] the time that I got it because there
[1:52:15] came a time where that seed that was
[1:52:17] planted actually heard the word of God
[1:52:20] and I'll tell you what I had an exp
[1:52:22] experience like Saul I went to a boring
[1:52:25] regular Wednesday night service heard
[1:52:27] the pastor preach his heart that he'd
[1:52:29] been preparing he probably never knew
[1:52:31] that I was even coming but then
[1:52:32] something happened in that service and I
[1:52:35] can imagine nobody saw a pillar of fire
[1:52:37] nobody saw Sparks and lightning but I'll
[1:52:39] tell you what I said God if you're God
[1:52:41] then be God to me in my life it wasn't
[1:52:45] about anybody else it was my own selfish
[1:52:47] little moment but that moment turned
[1:52:49] into something because I became a new
[1:52:50] creature in Christ I no longer desired
[1:52:52] the things that I
[1:52:55] desired but what I was getting at is I
[1:52:58] could say my dad never brought me up in
[1:52:59] the message my dad did this my dad did
[1:53:01] that my dad did the other I'm so
[1:53:03] thankful that my dad taught me something
[1:53:05] real important he said you know what be
[1:53:07] accountable for your own actions blaming
[1:53:10] your problems on other people is a cheap
[1:53:14] excuse it's an excuse to behave
[1:53:17] poorly thank you Dad for teaching me
[1:53:20] that be accountable for your own action
[1:53:23] you know what we need to do brothers and
[1:53:25] sisters to be accountable for our own
[1:53:27] actions is what exactly Paul says here
[1:53:29] forget those things which are behind now
[1:53:32] if anybody had the desire to forget
[1:53:34] about the things which were behind it
[1:53:36] must have been Paul
[1:53:38] yeah persecuting the church his
[1:53:42] Brethren the people that are supposed to
[1:53:44] love him now how is he ever going to
[1:53:46] have the opportunity to go and share
[1:53:48] with them what happened on the road to
[1:53:50] Damascus they're not going to want to
[1:53:51] talk to them and we we know they didn't
[1:53:53] want to talk to him naturally speaking
[1:53:55] they wanted nothing to do with this guy
[1:53:57] because they were looking at the flesh
[1:54:00] but here we have the first Apostle the
[1:54:02] first church age messenger saying forget
[1:54:04] about all the things in the past so you
[1:54:06] know what the prophet said in the
[1:54:08] exposition of the seven Church ages he
[1:54:09] said he set the pattern for all other
[1:54:12] ages yeah you agree with me there say
[1:54:14] amen he set the pattern for every other
[1:54:16] age so brothers and sisters we've got no
[1:54:19] right dragging around a ball and chain
[1:54:21] saying I remember this hurt I remember
[1:54:23] this pain I remember what happened we're
[1:54:26] doing it
[1:54:32] wrong some might say
[1:54:34] well this is the prophet he's an apostle
[1:54:37] he's got a supernatural Edge he's got a
[1:54:40] supernatural ability to forget those
[1:54:42] things brother Barry you don't know my
[1:54:44] heart you don't know what I've gone
[1:54:45] through nope I
[1:54:47] don't but you don't know what I've gone
[1:54:49] through
[1:54:50] either and I could go through my life
[1:54:52] and say that it's this person's fault
[1:54:54] and that person's fault and the other
[1:54:56] person's issue and because of all the
[1:54:58] rest of it now it's this and it might be
[1:55:02] but what's that to you and we know
[1:55:04] that's what Jesus said what's that to
[1:55:06] you follow thou me we don't have any
[1:55:09] right to try and drag around ball and
[1:55:11] chain because if we if we were to do
[1:55:13] that we wouldn't have his spirit inside
[1:55:15] of us brothers and
[1:55:16] sisters Paul recognizing that he counts
[1:55:20] himself not having to apprehend it he
[1:55:22] did not apprehend it he didn't make it
[1:55:24] there but this one thing he does he
[1:55:26] forgets those things which are behind
[1:55:29] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:55:31] which are before amen now really where I
[1:55:33] want to go this morning and we still
[1:55:36] have a little bit of time praise the
[1:55:37] Lord let's do some marriage
[1:55:39] counseling as husbands and wives how
[1:55:42] many things are we
[1:55:44] remembering how many things are we
[1:55:46] remembering how many times has our
[1:55:48] husband stomped on our toes how many
[1:55:51] times has our wife
[1:55:53] made us
[1:55:54] bitter how many times have we gone
[1:55:56] through all of that are we dragging that
[1:55:57] stuff
[1:55:59] around now I'm preaching to me
[1:56:02] amen I'm preaching right here brothers
[1:56:04] and sisters this is where we live this
[1:56:06] is the life we have as children are
[1:56:08] parents they freaked out and and they
[1:56:10] they maybe put their fist through a wall
[1:56:12] maybe they kicked a door in maybe they
[1:56:14] slammed the door maybe they they treated
[1:56:16] mommy badly because they were mad
[1:56:18] whatever children we don't have the
[1:56:20] opportunity or occasion to now I don't
[1:56:23] have to serve the Lord because of the
[1:56:24] way my dad
[1:56:26] acts we need to get aligned with the
[1:56:28] word and we need to honor our father and
[1:56:31] our mother that's what the word of God
[1:56:33] says and it is without condition it
[1:56:35] doesn't matter what the parents have
[1:56:36] done to us and some parents have been
[1:56:39] very very bad
[1:56:41] parents very bad
[1:56:43] parents but that does still doesn't
[1:56:45] exclude us doesn't give us the license
[1:56:48] to misbehave according to the word of
[1:56:50] God because Paul said follow me as I
[1:56:52] follow Christ follow me as I follow
[1:56:55] Christ forgetting those things which are
[1:56:57] in the past I forget all those things I
[1:57:00] forget the things that I think my wife
[1:57:03] has done wrong to me it's not going to
[1:57:05] do any good for the situation and you
[1:57:07] know what I'm I'm real good at it I'll
[1:57:09] tell you honestly I'm real good at
[1:57:11] taking a moment in time and saying this
[1:57:13] little problem right here is this
[1:57:15] problem right here from the very first
[1:57:17] time I got married we had this s problem
[1:57:20] this situation and and take this little
[1:57:22] tiny thing and make it this thing it's
[1:57:25] not that's my
[1:57:28] nature pray for
[1:57:30] me I'm so thankful that I've got a wife
[1:57:32] that does she prays for
[1:57:35] me and you know what when that prayer
[1:57:38] goes through something happens and I'm
[1:57:41] able to just not look at that that that
[1:57:43] whole thing I can just look at that
[1:57:44] little thing and say you know what just
[1:57:46] forget it just forget those things and
[1:57:48] put them behind us because as husband
[1:57:50] and wife we want to press to rewards the
[1:57:52] Mark or the prize of the High Calling of
[1:57:54] God in Christ Jesus we don't want to
[1:57:57] stay
[1:57:59] here it's coming a Time brothers and
[1:58:01] sisters where we when we do this when
[1:58:04] when we do press towards the mark for
[1:58:05] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:58:07] Christ Jesus long enough the Rapture is
[1:58:09] going to happen and we're not going to
[1:58:10] have to endure here in brother Barry
[1:58:13] harp we're not going to have to go to
[1:58:15] church we're not going to have prayer
[1:58:16] meetings we're not going to have any of
[1:58:18] the stuff that we contend with in our
[1:58:19] lives what we're going to have is
[1:58:21] perfect
[1:58:22] affection and a thousand years to
[1:58:25] express all of the joy that's in our
[1:58:28] hearts for all of the battles that we
[1:58:30] fought all the sleepless nights that
[1:58:32] we've had we're going to be able to just
[1:58:34] get that out of our system we're going
[1:58:35] to have a thousand years to do that amen
[1:58:38] I just think it's wonderful though to
[1:58:39] think how Paul the Apostle first he goes
[1:58:41] through and names out all of these
[1:58:43] different attributes that he has all
[1:58:45] these great things according to the
[1:58:47] world according to the church all of
[1:58:49] these these maybe stickers and badges
[1:58:51] and diplomas that he's earned and he's
[1:58:53] earned them but he counts them all as
[1:58:55] dung they don't mean nothing they don't
[1:58:57] mean nothing compared to that
[1:58:59] relationship that he has with the Lord
[1:59:01] Jesus Christ my but you know to think
[1:59:04] about all the things that he had to put
[1:59:05] behind
[1:59:07] him we have to do the same thing in our
[1:59:09] lives brothers and sisters he said
[1:59:10] follow me as I follow Christ and I'm
[1:59:12] forgetting all those things which are in
[1:59:13] the past the things that I can't change
[1:59:16] because they're going to only Bring Me
[1:59:17] Down they're going to make me think you
[1:59:18] know if we did that in our lives if we
[1:59:20] just wandered around and we just said my
[1:59:23] I did this wrong and man I did that
[1:59:27] wrong all the different things that we
[1:59:29] do wrong in our lives could you imagine
[1:59:30] if we had that list we know the devil
[1:59:32] has that list he has that list and he's
[1:59:35] not afraid to bring it and he's not
[1:59:37] afraid to start reading it out and and
[1:59:39] saying it to us in our minds and in our
[1:59:42] hearts and making us think about all the
[1:59:44] terrible things that we've done but I if
[1:59:46] we're willing to die out to ourselves
[1:59:48] and humble ourselves one to another in
[1:59:50] the fear of God he he will come around
[1:59:53] and lift us up he will give us a release
[1:59:55] from all of that garbage in our lives
[1:59:58] that selft talk is so terrible in our
[2:00:01] lives I just want to say it today let's
[2:00:03] press towards that Mark for the prize of
[2:00:05] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:00:07] let's not live in the past you know if
[2:00:10] we're living in the past there's no way
[2:00:13] that we're ever going to have any
[2:00:15] future how can we have future living in
[2:00:17] the past many people will say well you
[2:00:19] can judge the You can predict the future
[2:00:21] by looking at the past and sure enough
[2:00:23] you can when you're talking about
[2:00:24] history but let's talk about the Church
[2:00:26] of the Living God like Christians out of
[2:00:29] perfect strength by Perfect weakness in
[2:00:34] 1961 brother bam he says God took Paul
[2:00:38] and made a slave out of
[2:00:41] him he took Paul and made a slave out of
[2:00:44] him bound him to himself and sent him to
[2:00:48] the
[2:00:49] Gentiles which he hated
[2:00:52] that wasn't God that hated him just to
[2:00:54] be clear it was Paul he didn't like the
[2:00:58] Gentiles says he hated them but you see
[2:01:01] he had to be loosed from his
[2:01:04] ecclesiastical power to be bound to the
[2:01:07] power of
[2:01:09] God and brothers and sisters I just
[2:01:11] think this is so important for us to
[2:01:13] just maybe examine a little bit just
[2:01:16] think about sometimes we can have maybe
[2:01:19] a little bit of a a message theological
[2:01:22] ecclesiastical power in our lives that
[2:01:25] we can become bound to we need to get
[2:01:27] rid of that and say the whole purpose of
[2:01:29] the message of the hour is so that we
[2:01:31] can get to Christ Jesus so that we can
[2:01:34] have that new birth experience like Paul
[2:01:37] where all the people that knew him
[2:01:39] before would say who is this guy how
[2:01:42] could he be this
[2:01:46] way to be bound to the power of
[2:01:49] God he had to be loose from his
[2:01:52] ecclesiastical power to be bound to the
[2:01:55] power of God he had to lose his strength
[2:01:58] and become weak and nothing in order to
[2:02:01] receive the strength of God to be bound
[2:02:04] to God to do what God would tell him to
[2:02:08] do brother Bram says that's what we have
[2:02:11] to do today that's what I need I I say
[2:02:14] that's what I need amen I I need that
[2:02:17] that's what every man needs is a loss of
[2:02:20] himself loss of his ability loss of what
[2:02:24] he is that he might have a complete
[2:02:27] yielding to the Holy
[2:02:30] Spirit and we know that if you're a
[2:02:32] child of God and you're
[2:02:35] running you will
[2:02:37] come you will
[2:02:40] come oh my we can listen to that message
[2:02:42] a man uh running from the presence of
[2:02:44] the Lord a man running from the presence
[2:02:47] of God will come he goes on to say
[2:02:50] that's what we have to do today that's
[2:02:52] what I need that's what every man needs
[2:02:53] is a loss of himself loss of ability
[2:02:56] loss of what he is that he might have a
[2:02:59] complete yielding to the Holy
[2:03:02] Spirit the housewife needs that the
[2:03:06] school boy needs
[2:03:08] that we take even our little children I
[2:03:12] think it's so beautiful we all need that
[2:03:15] he says it in such a way that it's
[2:03:17] Crystal Clear there's no just guessing
[2:03:19] about it and saying well that's maybe
[2:03:21] just the minister and maybe it's just
[2:03:22] the the deacons of the church and and
[2:03:25] maybe it's the trustees of the treasurer
[2:03:27] maybe it's just the the whoever no it's
[2:03:30] every single one of us we all need that
[2:03:32] dying out and when we get that dying out
[2:03:35] there is a life that comes
[2:03:37] forward sometimes maybe even as a child
[2:03:40] it can sound a little frightening I
[2:03:41] don't want to die maybe even as an adult
[2:03:44] it can be that way man I like who I
[2:03:47] am I could look myself in the mirror and
[2:03:50] say I'm ridiculously good-look
[2:03:52] I don't want to die man I've got
[2:03:55] everything going for me I've got H uh
[2:03:57] nice cars I got a nice house I got lots
[2:04:00] of nice clothes I got a beautiful wife
[2:04:02] everything's going for me I don't want
[2:04:03] to die we're not talking about dying in
[2:04:06] this flesh we're talking about dying in
[2:04:08] our spirit remember what I I said on
[2:04:11] Wednesday I think it's so good you know
[2:04:13] there's the soul and there's the spirit
[2:04:16] and the spirit is who we think we are
[2:04:19] our spirit is who we think we are and
[2:04:21] who the whole world World sees us as I'm
[2:04:24] this great guy my goodness aren't I good
[2:04:27] but then the Soul on the inside is who
[2:04:31] we really
[2:04:32] are and when we go and present ourselves
[2:04:35] as this really good guy really good girl
[2:04:38] we're movers and shakers and we can do
[2:04:39] all this and we've done all that and
[2:04:41] we've got all of the other stuff in our
[2:04:43] lives everything's going good you know
[2:04:45] what that's a sign that that Soul on the
[2:04:48] inside is a skunk there's something
[2:04:51] wrong on the inside there but you know
[2:04:54] the the spirit is who we think we are
[2:04:56] the soul is who we really are and
[2:04:58] there's only one way to get those two
[2:05:00] divided and that's the word of God that
[2:05:03] that that sword that word that's a sword
[2:05:05] a two-edged sharper than a two-edged
[2:05:06] sword that that divides the suer the the
[2:05:09] bones and the marrow that that goes even
[2:05:11] to the Discerning the heart of a man
[2:05:14] that that is what we need brothers and
[2:05:16] sisters and when we can get that then we
[2:05:18] can recognize that we haven't
[2:05:20] apprehended that what we're going to do
[2:05:22] is forget about all the stuff in the
[2:05:24] past and we're just going to press
[2:05:25] forwards we're just going to live an
[2:05:27] example in our lives to show the world
[2:05:29] around us that we truly believe this
[2:05:31] message of the
[2:05:32] hour this progressive revelation thing I
[2:05:35] think it's so beautiful how far along
[2:05:37] down the road are we really from when
[2:05:39] the prophet was here we're not going to
[2:05:41] progress into a new message don't get me
[2:05:43] wrong we're not going to progress into a
[2:05:46] new theology or a new teaching that's
[2:05:48] not going to happen the prophet when he
[2:05:50] was here he already said we've gone
[2:05:52] beyond the actual leoan Church age and
[2:05:54] I'm just ad living here I'm not saying
[2:05:56] that's an exact quote but he did say
[2:05:58] that we are now in the bride age amen so
[2:06:02] what age are we in are we in the leoan
[2:06:03] age or are we in the bride age I would
[2:06:05] personally say that we're in the bride
[2:06:07] age because that's what the prophet said
[2:06:09] how far along are we brothers and
[2:06:10] sisters now that the word is completely
[2:06:12] open how far along are we that that we
[2:06:16] understand that we're the Bride of Jesus
[2:06:17] Christ that all of the Bible is open
[2:06:19] that all of the loose ends are tied up
[2:06:21] now how far along down that road are we
[2:06:23] and how now is our lives reflecting that
[2:06:26] progressive
[2:06:28] revelation are we still groping in
[2:06:30] darkness in certain things in our lives
[2:06:33] as a husband as a wife as a child as a
[2:06:36] brother to a sister as a sister to a
[2:06:38] brother are we still behaving like
[2:06:40] nominal church members or are we
[2:06:42] behaving according to the word of
[2:06:44] God now remember brother Barry's
[2:06:47] preaching to
[2:06:48] himself sometimes when I'm preaching
[2:06:50] I'll feel like maybe I shouldn't say
[2:06:52] that but I know what that is I know
[2:06:55] exactly what that is that's time to say
[2:06:58] it progressive revelation brothers and
[2:07:01] sisters where are we at we can have all
[2:07:04] the Revelation in the world but are we
[2:07:05] dying out to ourselves have we died out
[2:07:07] to ourselves do we know that we truly
[2:07:10] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:11] there's only one way that we're going to
[2:07:13] see The Rapture and that's to have the
[2:07:14] baptism of the Holy
[2:07:16] Ghost and if we go through life
[2:07:18] resisting the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:20] we've got the mark of the beast it's one
[2:07:22] or the other remember it's truth or
[2:07:24] error it's black or white there's no
[2:07:27] middle ground there's no in between
[2:07:28] there's no many different ways to get to
[2:07:30] Christ there's only one way one truth
[2:07:33] and one
[2:07:36] life so why do we seem to
[2:07:39] struggle why are so many people tossed
[2:07:42] about why are so many Christians not
[2:07:44] able to
[2:07:45] overcome why does that
[2:07:48] happen it's because they're too busy
[2:07:50] trying to do it on their own
[2:07:54] just say what it is let's just be honest
[2:07:56] with it and just say we're too busy
[2:07:58] trying to do it on our own we're too
[2:07:59] busy trying to make it happen we need to
[2:08:03] die out to ourselves so that he can
[2:08:07] live but why do we seem to continually
[2:08:10] struggle it's it's our own will you know
[2:08:13] the overcoming power in this life is to
[2:08:16] overcome the devil and it's to overcome
[2:08:18] sin and it's to overcome death but that
[2:08:22] overcoming power is also to overcome
[2:08:24] ourselves because if we can't overcome
[2:08:27] ourselves then we can't overcome any of
[2:08:29] the other stuff all of that other stuff
[2:08:32] maybe not all of it maybe it'll just be
[2:08:33] one little speck of of the devil and and
[2:08:36] maybe one little tiny Speck of sin in
[2:08:40] our lives not much live a good clean
[2:08:43] Christian life but there's one thing
[2:08:45] remember one one thing to be guilty of
[2:08:48] the least is to be guilty of the whole
[2:08:50] remember Jesus talked about the story of
[2:08:52] the leaven I I'm into sour dough I think
[2:08:55] it's fun I love to build things and
[2:08:58] create things and and I especially love
[2:09:01] to bake things now I got into it because
[2:09:03] you can actually eat what you make it's
[2:09:05] pretty cool I've done lots of
[2:09:07] Woodworking and I haven't really tried
[2:09:09] eating the wood I don't think it would
[2:09:10] taste good but you know baking bread is
[2:09:13] fun and you use the sourdough starter
[2:09:16] which is the same as yeast natural yeast
[2:09:18] and you know when there's a little tiny
[2:09:20] bit of yeast in in that jar and you put
[2:09:22] food and water in that guess what
[2:09:24] happens that yeast comes to life and it
[2:09:26] just bubbles over it just builds and and
[2:09:29] there's a life in there and if you have
[2:09:31] any of that contaminant with new flour
[2:09:33] and new water it's just going to happen
[2:09:37] if you don't want that you can't have
[2:09:39] any at all yeast get in that flour and
[2:09:42] water and it's the same thing in our
[2:09:44] lives if we have one little speck of sin
[2:09:46] we're we're guilty of all of it that
[2:09:48] little speck of sin that's not dealt
[2:09:50] with is going to cause us to be corrupt
[2:09:52] individuals in other areas of our lives
[2:09:55] but the word is completely open to
[2:09:56] Deliver Us from that isn't that a
[2:09:58] beautiful thought that's why the prophet
[2:10:00] came to give us the overcoming power to
[2:10:03] give us the open book to actually be
[2:10:05] used by God to be the mouthpiece for God
[2:10:07] to speak through for the angel of the
[2:10:09] Lord to meet with him seven nights in a
[2:10:11] row and explain to him the truth of the
[2:10:14] message of the hour and what those seals
[2:10:16] are so that he could preach Deliverance
[2:10:19] to us so so that he could give us the
[2:10:22] entirety of the word in our
[2:10:25] lives so that we could overcome our own
[2:10:28] will and say just like Mary not not my
[2:10:31] will but let thy will be done because
[2:10:33] you know brothers and sisters there's
[2:10:35] only one way that we can ever do that
[2:10:37] and that's according to the Free Will
[2:10:39] that he's given us if if we're willing
[2:10:41] to do that one
[2:10:43] time that's all he needs one time for us
[2:10:47] to say truly if you're God then be God
[2:10:50] to me see God for me in my life I can
[2:10:53] see God in other people around I can see
[2:10:55] God in my parents I can see God in my
[2:10:57] spouse I can see God maybe in in in the
[2:11:00] pastor or the treasurer the deacons or
[2:11:03] the trustees and my brother my sister I
[2:11:05] can see God all around but I need God to
[2:11:08] be real to me if you ever do that just
[2:11:10] one time you will never be the same if
[2:11:12] you genuinely mean it you will never
[2:11:15] ever be the same what that is is dying
[2:11:17] out to your own will and and I'll say
[2:11:19] this you'll be dying out to your own
[2:11:21] personal complexes you'll be dying out
[2:11:24] to every single thing in your life
[2:11:27] because what you get is overcoming power
[2:11:29] you get Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:11:32] today and forever taking up a boat
[2:11:33] inside of
[2:11:35] you we can talk about Abram on the
[2:11:38] plains of mammory when he gets a name
[2:11:40] change when he saw three men coming
[2:11:42] towards the tent In the Heat of the day
[2:11:44] he was just relaxing waiting upon the
[2:11:46] promise that God had told him but we
[2:11:48] know brother brandom talked about just
[2:11:50] taking those those elements and blowing
[2:11:52] and a body and he stepped into and his
[2:11:55] two angels came down with him that went
[2:11:56] down to Sodom he doesn't do that anymore
[2:12:00] what he does is has a man and a woman
[2:12:02] come together in a union and they have a
[2:12:05] child and once that child reaches a
[2:12:07] certain age I'll call it of
[2:12:08] accountability whatever age that is it
[2:12:11] could be six years old it could be three
[2:12:12] years old it can be 50 years old it can
[2:12:15] be 70 years old brother bradam said he
[2:12:17] led a woman to Christ when she was 90
[2:12:19] years old that's what the prophet or
[2:12:20] that's what the Angel told him when he
[2:12:22] was there on the other side right that
[2:12:24] woman that you didn't recognize she was
[2:12:25] a 20-year-old
[2:12:27] woman God will take and use any one of
[2:12:29] us at any time in our lives but he'll
[2:12:32] give us the ability to overcome this guy
[2:12:37] ourselves I should probably call the
[2:12:39] musicians we're close to 12 now but you
[2:12:41] know brothers and sisters if we can ever
[2:12:42] really humble ourselves to the
[2:12:44] word recognize that our own
[2:12:48] weakness is where he's made perfect
[2:12:51] am I just think it might be a little bit
[2:12:54] of a help to us because sometimes we can
[2:12:57] live our lives and present strong
[2:13:02] strength we're we're we're strong
[2:13:05] individuals and we've got a really good
[2:13:07] solid Constitution sure enough we do but
[2:13:11] sometimes it doesn't hurt to be weak
[2:13:14] sometimes it doesn't hurt to say that
[2:13:16] I'm not Invincible that I hurt in my
[2:13:19] heart that I hurt hurt in my spirit that
[2:13:22] I've got pain in my life and I don't
[2:13:25] know how to fix it sometimes it doesn't
[2:13:28] hurt to admit those things because when
[2:13:30] we're willing to be honest that's when
[2:13:32] he's going to come on the scene and help
[2:13:34] us but as long as we're busy doing it
[2:13:37] and being
[2:13:38] strong he's going to say
[2:13:41] okay when we can recognize our own
[2:13:43] weakness I'm not going to look for
[2:13:45] anyone to recognize and speak out your
[2:13:47] own weakness you know your own weakness
[2:13:48] you we know we know exactly what our
[2:13:50] weakness is is because if we have the
[2:13:52] desire to serve Christ and we have come
[2:13:56] all the way up to the promised land
[2:13:57] maybe we've even got our foot over into
[2:13:59] the promised land but then we get a
[2:14:01] little bit nervous and we step back a
[2:14:02] little bit and then maybe we try again
[2:14:04] and and and maybe we get a couple steps
[2:14:06] in but then it just gets a little bit
[2:14:07] scary because we know the Giants are
[2:14:09] there and they see us as grasshoppers
[2:14:10] according to what the people said not
[2:14:12] what God Said but we just come to that
[2:14:14] place where we're just not sure and we
[2:14:16] just can't go all the way you know what
[2:14:18] happens
[2:14:20] is we can become a little bit tainted we
[2:14:22] can become a little bit calloused in our
[2:14:24] walk and and it can become normal for us
[2:14:27] to just go in and out and in and out but
[2:14:30] I want to say today brothers and sisters
[2:14:32] if you've never taken and just marched
[2:14:34] right into that Promised Land do it with
[2:14:36] all your might try it with all your
[2:14:38] might and we're not talking about a
[2:14:40] geographical location we're talking
[2:14:41] about the true baptism of the Holy
[2:14:43] Spirit the the the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:46] taking up his Abode in ourselves we know
[2:14:48] the word says to submit yourselves one
[2:14:51] to another in the fear of God try it try
[2:14:54] and submit yourself one to another maybe
[2:14:56] there's a circumstance maybe there's a
[2:14:58] situation in your life where there's
[2:15:00] unforgiveness where there's something in
[2:15:02] our lives that we just can't seem to get
[2:15:03] over just submit yourself one to another
[2:15:06] in the fear of God in genuine humility
[2:15:09] and you know what brothers and sisters
[2:15:10] where it seems like there's a mountain
[2:15:12] where it seems like there's an an
[2:15:14] immovable object there is a situation
[2:15:16] that cannot be fixed ever on this side
[2:15:19] of Eternity we are dealing with a God
[2:15:21] that specializes in in Miracles he can
[2:15:24] do anything brothers and sisters there's
[2:15:26] nothing that he can't fix in our lives
[2:15:28] he's just waiting for us to genuinely
[2:15:31] submit ourselves unto him and say I'm
[2:15:34] willing to forget about all those things
[2:15:35] in the past and alls I want to do is
[2:15:37] reach forth unto those things which are
[2:15:40] before me I only want to see the power
[2:15:42] of God move in my life if you're willing
[2:15:44] to do that genuinely I promise you he
[2:15:46] will he will this book will become a new
[2:15:49] book maybe stand with me as we close
[2:15:51] today this message of the hour will
[2:15:53] become a brand new message of the
[2:15:57] hour I want to say today brothers and
[2:15:59] sisters true Revelation doesn't puff us
[2:16:02] up true Revelation humbles us we were
[2:16:06] talking about it on the weekend on the
[2:16:07] car ride there's nothing better than
[2:16:09] having a car ride with Believers when
[2:16:11] all you've got to do is talk and you
[2:16:14] know true Revelation doesn't puff us up
[2:16:17] the further that I go down this road in
[2:16:19] in the message of the hour in this Walk
[2:16:21] With Jesus Christ the more I recognize
[2:16:23] that there's nothing that I did I did
[2:16:26] nothing to deserve this he did it all he
[2:16:29] paid it all he actually slew the lamb
[2:16:33] before the foundation of the world
[2:16:35] before this world was even created he
[2:16:38] spoke our names into
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:16:45] existence
[2:16:47] my 1957 why is it so many Christians
[2:16:51] find it so hard to live the Christian
[2:16:53] Life brother Brandon preached a message
[2:16:55] called that
[2:16:56] 1957 why is it that so many Christians
[2:17:01] find it so hard to live the Christian
[2:17:06] life now he's talking about
[2:17:09] watches clocks that have Springs inside
[2:17:12] them Precision Instruments he says now
[2:17:15] it's the main spring that does it it's
[2:17:18] the holy spirit that does it
[2:17:21] it isn't your church that does it it
[2:17:25] isn't your pastor that does
[2:17:28] it it isn't your
[2:17:30] shouting that does it it isn't your
[2:17:33] speaking with tongues that does
[2:17:36] it it isn't your healing service that
[2:17:40] does it because a brother has a healing
[2:17:43] gift and people are continually blessed
[2:17:46] with healings at that church that's not
[2:17:48] what does
[2:17:49] it it's it's the holy spirit that does
[2:17:53] it God's holy spirit in the middle of
[2:17:57] your new
[2:17:59] spirit that's what does
[2:18:02] it it makes the whole church operate
[2:18:06] just exactly one big bundle of
[2:18:09] love that sounds kind of pie in the sky
[2:18:13] doesn't
[2:18:14] it but here we have the prophet the
[2:18:17] messenger for our age saying this oh
[2:18:20] don't we need it
[2:18:22] friends examine ourselves today and I
[2:18:26] love how he says it every time he takes
[2:18:27] it back to that and I just love to point
[2:18:29] it out examine it by the word
[2:18:32] see is your life ticking off just like
[2:18:36] that see everything love what's the
[2:18:40] fruit of it I'm a good husband I live
[2:18:43] according to Ephesians chapter 5 my wife
[2:18:45] is supposed to submit unto me yeah
[2:18:49] what's the fruit in our marriage
[2:18:51] what kind of fruit is hanging on our
[2:18:53] husband Tree is it Joy is it love is it
[2:19:00] peace is it patience is it
[2:19:05] longsuffering oh don't we need it
[2:19:07] friends examine ourselves today examine
[2:19:09] it by the word see is your life ticking
[2:19:11] off just like that see everything love
[2:19:14] what's the fruit of it how do you know
[2:19:16] it's keeping right time it's got
[2:19:19] love because we're talking about keeping
[2:19:21] time with the word love is out of
[2:19:23] Corinthians now vth not itself doesn't
[2:19:27] say I'm the king submit to me love
[2:19:32] vaunteth not itself it's not puffed
[2:19:36] up it's
[2:19:39] sociable it's sociable it loves to get
[2:19:43] together with the brothers and the
[2:19:44] sisters because that's what we're going
[2:19:46] to do for eternity it's sociable it's
[2:19:49] neighborly
[2:19:51] loving believing all things hoping all
[2:19:54] things love joy peace longsuffering
[2:19:57] goodness gentleness patience Meek Faith
[2:20:01] All These Fine qualities is ticking out
[2:20:03] of that person's life when the holy
[2:20:06] spirit's in there ticking it
[2:20:10] around I love how he brings this he says
[2:20:13] it why people find it so hard to live a
[2:20:17] Christian Life why people find it so
[2:20:20] hard to live in that realm he says it
[2:20:23] it's the Holy Spirit now it wasn't by
[2:20:25] intellectual conception it's not by
[2:20:27] saying that I understand the message of
[2:20:28] the hour I know all the quotes there's
[2:20:30] nothing you can throw at me that I don't
[2:20:31] know it's not by intellectual conception
[2:20:34] that brings this forth and I think that
[2:20:37] is unfortunately the trick or the Trap
[2:20:40] it's the problem in and around this
[2:20:42] message that causes people to just be
[2:20:44] right there on the edge they're never
[2:20:46] able to come in all the way they're just
[2:20:48] so
[2:20:49] close because because it's intellectual
[2:20:51] conception it can't be that that's not
[2:20:53] what it's going to bring it forth it's
[2:20:56] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[2:20:58] brings this and he says this if you're
[2:21:01] trying to live a Christian Life I'm
[2:21:02] going to say this myself if you're
[2:21:04] trying to live a message life you're
[2:21:06] only
[2:21:07] impersonating don't impersonate brothers
[2:21:09] and sisters get the Holy Ghost in your
[2:21:12] life and that's why this message was
[2:21:14] given so that we could get the Holy
[2:21:16] Ghost the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ the
[2:21:19] person of Jesus Christ the thing that
[2:21:23] all the a throughout all the ages all
[2:21:25] the sages and Prophets and Angels
[2:21:27] desired to
[2:21:29] see we've got it and what is it it's
[2:21:33] Jesus Christ Living out through us let's
[2:21:36] just bow in prayer as we close Heavenly
[2:21:39] Father Lord help us not to impersonate
[2:21:44] Christianity help us Lord to go all the
[2:21:46] way into the true baptism of your Holy
[2:21:48] Spirit help us Lord to die out to
[2:21:51] ourselves father oh Lord Jesus not to be
[2:21:54] bound to a Creed or a tradition but Lord

[2:22:17] pray that something that was said somewh
[2:22:20] where along the way with their visit

[2:22:27] better father maybe come to know you a
[2:22:29] little more Lord Jesus and father maybe
[2:22:32] not change the way they are but that

[2:22:41] chiefest of Sinners if we really were to
[2:22:44] look at it Lord Jesus and father we all
[2:22:47] rely on that very same Grace Lord Jesus
[2:22:50] that Grace that you gave before the
[2:22:52] foundation of the world when you said

[2:22:56] sake and I know they're going to sin
[2:22:57] they're going to be born in sin shaped
