Lord we judge ourselves tonight according to your word father and Lord we know that that's our assurance that we can step behind that Veil Lord Jesus and get into that that Holy Place father where you

musicians you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Saint John chapter 4. are you happy tonight Saint John chapter 4. we'll just start reading with verse 1. when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee it's interesting because he must have known the ministry had taken off the next Ministry the next stage the next level verse 4 and he came and sorry verse 3 and he left Judea and departed again into Galilee verse 4 and he must need to go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called saikar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me a drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat excuse me then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asketh asketh drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to to thee give me to drink that would have had have thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Once then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that setest thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that Messiahs cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for this story tonight and Lord we just ask that you would break it open fresh to us once again Lord that we could see you just like that woman at Samaria saw you father Lord we pray that we could just recognize it that it would become so clear to us where we are who we are and where we are standing in the Sands of Time Lord we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated isn't he wonderful how many enjoyed that service on Sunday my there's so many points in there that uh I'm still chewing on God bless you brother Ben certainly appreciate you surrendering and I just want to say a big thank you also to brother Faron for stepping up and taking the songs while brother Paul was sick and it just was a wonderful time it's it's tremendous to hear the different Ministries in the body and you know song leading is a Ministry and I know there's a bunch of songs that we need to learn and I'm excited to be able to learn them it's such a variety of of worship to be able to learn new songs and uh and just be able to to expand our Horizons and so I just want to say a big thank you to brother Faron for stepping in and it's a big responsibility but uh you know we have to set the environment we have to set the atmosphere to hear from the word of the Lord and we know that worship is a tremendous part of the actual service and and God bless you visitors uh I didn't see you there I apologize this is Sister Grace's family yeah from Connecticut God bless you welcome [Applause] I uh I'm sorry I don't have everyone's names so I'm not even gonna attempt it but it's Grace's family we'll be certainly happy to greet you after the service God bless you um yeah it's just uh it's such an important thing to to be able to come and and be a part of the worship and uh set that atmosphere and you know we set the atmosphere in the room we do that but more than anything we set the atmosphere in our heart and that's what brother Branham said about coming to service half an hour early he said to do that that was an instruction from Brother Branham and uh I think some might be able to interpret it and we know that it's it's difficult on a Wednesday I'm not trying to come down on anyone I'm not trying to do that I'm not like that at all I'm just saying what the prophet said and the reason for it the reason for it is to set the atmosphere we want to be able to hear from heaven when we come to church we want to leave this building differently than when we come in and you know the prophet also said that we do whether we recognize it or not we will actually leave here warmer towards God than we were when we came in or we will leave colder than we were before we came in and that's the way it is we're either living or we're dying we're growing or we're shrinking there's no just staying in a neutral position in this world that's not the way that God created life you know we can take a look at plants and and see how plants are they're either growing or they're dying they're they're getting bigger or they're shrinking back and it's the same thing spiritually because we know brother Adam said it the natural types the spiritual so we just want to make sure that we we're in uh in uh I guess the proper order and we're thankful for the direction of the word in our day and we're thankful for each one that puts their heart into the services that puts their shoulder to the wheel week after week all of the musicians the sound technicians every single one is a volunteer nobody has paid for their positions here and uh it's just tremendous the desire that's in the hearts of each one to continually offer their gifts the deacons to stand at the doors the treasure to look after the finances the trustees to make sure that the building is always ready to go for us when we come to church it's it's a body effort and each one plays a part so we're certainly thankful for each one willing to step up and and help um we just have a few announcements before we get into the scripture tonight we'll be traveling next week so brother Emanuel has agreed to take the service on Wednesday we'll be back in time for Sunday service Lord willing and I trust it'll be a blessing I will be likely driving so I'll try and stream and if I can't stream I'll pick up the archive I don't know if everyone is aware that we have the archives I'm just going to mention it they're available on YouTube and uh what a tremendous thing it is I've been listening and listening to Sunday's service and there's so many nuggets in there and so I'll definitely be picking up the service on Wednesday and one of the things that the deacons and I have spoken of and I have failed to mention and I don't know why and I'm sorry for the visitors and everyone that's here is uh just a little bit of housekeeping we're growing in terms of the size of uh people in the congregation we're running out of seats so we're going to start actively pushing everybody forward there's always a hole right here this part's empty all of the time except for when we get into Sundays but then it's sporadic so the people who don't have small children we're going to invite you to move forward as we go forwards the people with smaller children we're going to invite you to move further forward as well so that the back rows are left open for the parents with small children because it doesn't make any sense for a parent with small children to be you know a third of the way up or half of the way up with a small child that can't sit still that makes noise it's the way children are we're not going to say that you have to have your children completely silent in church the only thing is and we've said this for years if your child does start to get a little noisy if it's crinkling papers or if it's talking or if it's crying just simply take it out just just take the child out of the sanctuary and maybe go downstairs with it don't don't don't worry about it being a big fuss nobody's going to come and and try and drag you out of the sanctuary but just be mindful of the people that are around you sometimes as a parent it can be very very difficult to actually pick up the sounds that our children make because we're used to children making sounds but you could be sitting beside someone that's not used to having children crinkling paper and and maybe tapping or clicking pens or doing things that are just like continuous sounds we want to make sure that we keep the reverence of the sanctuary brother Bonham talks about it there's paragraphs and pages that we could talk about keeping the reverence of the sanctuary he even goes so far as to say you know what a child running in the sanctuary could upset the Holy Ghost for the next service so we want to make sure that we are mindful of our children in the church especially when the service is happening so that being said we want to invite everyone who doesn't have the smaller children to move forward fill in these seats here so we leave room at the back for maybe late comers people who are maybe new to the church and for parents with small children I haven't said it we've talked about it for months and I apologize deacons I've said it and I'll just continue to remind us one of the other things I want to throw we talked about in the uh in the deacons meeting was potentially having some of the younger children just come and sit in the front rows and I know that could be a traditional thing that some other churches do but I think there's a reason for it when you start to get like small or larger group and you need to fill in some seats it's an opportunity for the children to actually really be attentive they're right in the front row and I can keep my eye on them it's just uh maybe an opportunity though for the children to feel like they're maybe growing a little bit right they don't have to sit beside mom and dad and I'm not trying to come between parents and children if you want your children to sit beside you then God bless you but I'm just saying that you know it's open if if the children want to do it and the parents are in agreement with it then we certainly welcome it we will be continuing to remind everyone to move forward don't be surprised if you have a deacon tap you on the shoulder and say please move forward or if they try and see you it's not because we're trying to come down on anyone like I said but we need to make room we've been talking about potential next steps with the building if we continue to grow the way we have been where we'll go what we'll do we don't know for now this is what we have and we want to try and make the best of it so if you can just please be mindful of everyone else around you then I'm sure it will make a difference God bless you tonight we appreciate every single one being here tonight I want to talk about this scripture I know I've talked about in the past but just from a little bit of a different perspective two points you know how we ended on verse 26 of of John chapter 4 and and it's Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and I think it's just beautiful because you know there's a couple of scriptures in here but verse 25 there's there's a such a dialogue with this story and I think it's so amazing verse 25 the woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things she was she was waiting for something she knew something was going to happen somewhere along the way somebody taught her she learned that this was supposed to happen and that's why I think it's so beautiful she recognized her day and its message and you know we have the same ability and I know every one of us recognize our day in its message but sometimes maybe it can get a little bit foggy we can get a little bit clogged up as we heard on Sunday we can get those those channels clogged up a little bit maybe with denominational teaching maybe with with Traditions maybe with culture maybe with misunderstandings you know we heard it when we were in Saskatoon brother Wayne brought it so clearly I had asked him years ago and I had forgot about it until we were actually on our way home you know I I think it's in the message things that are to be I could be wrong it's one of the latter messages in 1965 brother brownham he before he gets into the message he starts talking about a vision or a dream and how he saw those people trapped behind those bars and and he saw them and they were they were in trouble and and he saw brother Roy borders in there and he cried out to Roy borders and said I I love you my brother and and he saw them trapped in this situation Behind These Bars and and it wasn't long before the spirit of the Lord said to him deliver those people and and and I guess one of them said to him this is the house of hell I think brother Roy border said that this is the house of hell so brother Brown and he said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and set those people free but brother Wayne he brought it in such a way that he said those were bars of misunderstandings misunderstanding so many times we can have a misunderstanding I can be saying one thing to one person and I assume I think they're saying this they're understanding what I'm saying what I'm communicating to them but I come to find out a week later they're not actually they didn't hear what I said to them they didn't understand it they heard it with their ears maybe saw it with their eyes my lips were moving and and my voice and everything maybe my hands if I talked with my hands but they didn't actually understand the message that I was speaking to them sometimes we need to to make sure that we're actually recognizing what's being spoken and what's being said we can have misunderstandings and they can cause a lot of problems and that's why the word of God says if there's ought then just go to your brother your sister and just eliminate that that bar of misunderstanding eliminate a misunderstanding from becoming a bar because sometimes if that happens if it doesn't get resolved then it's going to keep the fellowship from happening there'll always be a space but I just think it's amazing this woman here she recognized it she wasn't living in a perfect condition isn't it such a beautiful story to think that she or she was a a woman with with maybe brother Bradham I think somewhere calls it a prostitute Spirit she's with her fifth not husband the fifth man she's with isn't her husband so what was she doing with her life shacking up with men and and living in sin but she recognized there was no hope for a while for a long time she was probably raised in a call it a message home in her day she was probably taught message teaching in in her time she was probably given the ability to to have a good life a good upbringing but somewhere along the way something happened to her we know there's a story brother bottom I think talks about where someone actually slipped something into the girl's soda pop and she drank it and she became defiled he took advantage of her maybe that happened to this one maybe something happened in it and it caused her to find her off in a position where she was no longer as pure as she desired to be and when that happens in our lives it's easy for the devil to say you know what you're already lost you've already changed your life you've already fallen from Grace so you might as well just go on and and go out there it's never going to get better and you know that's the life that we live that's the condition that we're in but it's so beautiful that we've been given an opportunity to recognize we have to stay there because if we've heard the message of the hour then then I that speak unto thee am he has come we've been able to recognize the coming of the Messiah in our day and that's what I want to get to is is the coming of our messiah in our day many people are looking for the Messiah to be coming riding on a white horse coming in clouds and and it's going to be like that one day brothers and sisters but that's Revelations 19. that's a long ways away in terms of where we're at spiritually today what we're living in today is the word coming of the Messiah and we have the ability to recognize it because you know the word of God says if you can't believe me the words that I speak to you then believe the works that I do because these are they that testify of who I am and we know that was one of the things brother Branham said and not just to who he is but where he is because he's come but Revelation power gifts manifestations of the Spirit and you know when we have his life living within us brothers and sisters it's not a bad thing to have power in fact we need to have his power in our lives and if we don't have his power in our lives then Satan is going to run roughshod over us he's going to steamroll us brother Branham goes on to say the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things I think it's just so beautiful I didn't count it but I think I'd like to go back and do it I'm sorry brother Ben I'm not picking on you but I just love that service anybody listen to it again you hear how many times he said holy ghost how important it is to get the Holy Ghost you have to get the Holy Ghost it's not optional the Holy Ghost is the only way that we are going to know for our day so in this day the Samaritans woman she said that she recognized that Messiah is going to come she knew there was a time coming that Messiah was supposed to come which is called the Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things she had full confidence that someday somewhere somehow he was coming to them she was taught that she believed it with all of her heart even though she couldn't live it because of the circumstances that was she as she was in but she had something on the inside of the inside just like a real believer today has to give her the ability to receive it when she recognized it when it came across her path when he came across her path and you know we know the scripture says that when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead us and guide us into all truth he the spirit of Truth is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the word of God lived out in a Believer today which is the Holy Ghost it's not just us saying oh I'm just going to take the word of God I'm going to study it I'm going to be so good at it just like the just like the Pharisees I remember brother Ken pointing it out the Pharisees or the Sadducees one of the two could roll up the scroll and put a pin through it poke a pin through it and be able to tell you exactly what words of the scripture that pin is actually piercing that's how well they knew the word that's not going to do it for us in our day brothers and sisters studying isn't going to get us in there actual travel going to a a special location isn't going to get us in there the only thing that's going to get us into heaven is the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that's going to open this word to us in our lives brother Branham says so I believe with all my heart I believe that we're nearing the age that where people are going to recognize these things I think it's so beautiful are you recognizing it brothers and sisters he says that we've had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it has set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the word of God it's Satan just eroding the word of God from the hearts of of children the hearts of the the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't have to let them we don't have to let them do it we can recognize our position we can recognize our day and its message and know with the surety that we don't have to allow all of that to happen and here I'm saying this brothers and sisters I've got to say it this way I I'll say it that way I believe the message of the hour and I know that I've got to say it that way and I've got to say it with conviction and I'm not just trying to put it on we can say oh brother Barry it's easy for you to preach Divine Healing when you haven't been sick before in your body but you know what brothers and sisters there's coming a day where I know that I'll be sick in my body but what am I going to do I'm not going to groan and lament and say oh I'm sick in my body and I've got to accept the the doctor's report and everything that's happening maybe it's coming for me pray for me I don't even know why I'm going this way the only thing I know is that Divine Healing is truly the children's bread that's what the prophet of God said that's what God Said through the prophet to his people and you know what we need to accept it or we need to reject it and by not accepting it we're rejecting it brothers and sisters we don't remain neutral like we said at the very beginning to say that I'm going to take the doctor's report over everything else the doctors report plus the symptoms and say just you know what this is my circumstance God if you want me to be healed you'll heal me we just need to say his word is greater than any circumstance in my life I love how brother Ben said it on Sunday when we're in different countries we have different privileges citizens of Kingdoms have different privileges and we in Canada probably I would say myself I I don't even fully recognize the Privileges that I have here I've gone to a couple different countries and seen a couple different ways and I've seen some things that have made me very thankful to be able to be back home and I think it's tremendous and you know it's it's amazing how how we can just sometimes take things for granted but here we are living in Canada and we have privileges because we're born as Canadian citizens in every country that we come from we have privileges according to that country that's the way it is when you're a citizen of that country and every country has it maybe some countries have more than others but you know what when we're talking about it spiritually we can't just go into the kingdom of God and obtain privileges it doesn't work that way we need to have a new birth and the only way that we have a new birth is to have a death there has to be a dying out to ourselves and as long as we're willing to do that there will be a new birth and I think it's so beautiful because if we truly earnestly contend for the faith if we are willing to be absolutely honest with ourselves not anybody else everybody else doesn't matter as much as they do we're a body here but I just want to bring it down to the personal level it's got to be that personal where nobody else matters in this world it's between me and God and you we we need to be willing to say just just let this body die let this person inside of me die and and let God live I want to see God live out through me so much that I don't want to see any more of me and just feel me so full of your Holy Spirit your holy ghost that there's no more of me and if we do that if we're willing to be honest about that completely he will fill us he will do it but you know in our our world the world that we live in North America where we have all these privileges it's interesting because brother Ben said it and I think it's just important to to really emphasize this stuff is that Satan he's come around and we know that that this already happened in like 57 was it 57 58 when they rejected Jesus Christ when they rejected the Lord Brother Bradham said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and most people said you're crazy now you're going off on your Doctrine when he said that but here we have in this world that we live in in North America Satan now is the God of this evil age and brother Branham said that the prophet for our day said that this is the only age where Satan is the God of this age and here he now enters into the hearts of the people all over the place we've talked about it there's a so many different things about all these pronouns and people and the way all this is going I'm not getting into that tonight but what I am saying is we can see all of that as an actual result of Satan entering into the hearts of people and now they fly a flag that says it's freedom they believe they're free the people are thinking that there's freedom in it when they don't recognize they're completely contrary to the word of God and if we were to actually speak these words to people that believe they're free we would be a fanatic I love how brother Ben brought it as well you know what in our uh in Noah's day Noah's manifestation of the word of God in his life was the ark that he built I thought that was so powerful you know when we have a manifestation in our lives there will be a manifestation in our lives is what I'm trying to say when when God speaks to us when we truly have that death burial and Resurrection in our own lives it's not something that we say oh it just happened in Israel one day or or somebody else in the congregation maybe the pastor the Deacon somebody else my grandma my grandpa my parents they've had that experience but I I haven't had it you know what we have to have it we all have to have it and when we have it something happens in our lives that was said very clearly on Sunday something takes place it's not like it's just wow I just continue to go to church and nothing changes in my life something changes in your life if you ask God to come and fill you with his Spirit brothers and sisters something changes Noah in his day he believed and when he believed he acted on what he believed in and that's what happens in the life of a Believer we act on what we believe if we believe that God sent a prophet then we act on what that Prophet said to us we go to church half an hour early we go to church when it's open on Wednesday we go to church when it's on Sunday we don't plan to stay away from church we go to church there's so many different things that we do when we're Believers when we act on it brothers and sisters now I'm I I say you know there's times where we go away we do have a holiday I'll say that but we don't stay home from going to church when we could go to church that's what I mean by that very specifically if you want to go on travel that's great sometimes you'll travel and you'll be away you can't go to church but when you do travel and you go away sometimes you can actually come to another church you can find other believers and you know that's such a wonderful thing to be able to do is to go on fellowship and meet new Believers but I just want to be clear I'm not trying to say that you know what it's you got to come to church and then you can't travel I'm not saying that at all I'm saying staying at home and streaming and saying that I don't have to go to church that's not right and I'm just going to stop there but you know we had this uh we had this other thing and then I'm gonna really get into our scripture tonight I got a half an hour I think it's so good though it's so tremendous though as Believers we don't chase money we don't chase money Believers don't chase money we chase the word of God we chase the leadership of the Lord in our lives and when we do that Money Follows and and you know I love the way brother Ben said it on on Sunday and I'd say the Lord said it's you brother Ben you know whatever it is we do we do it as unto the Lord and we do it with all of our might and you know if we can't do it that good he said don't do it I'll leave it up to you to say who he was that said that some will say it was brother Ben was it just brother Ben I don't know we need to do all that we can do with all of our hearts brothers and sisters and and just good enough is not good at all right to say oh it's good enough I'm guilty I know how many others are I might be the only one but I've done it in my life that's good enough who cares you know what there's times where we need to know where we have to stand with that but just good enough it's not enough God is going to hold us accountable and I don't think I'd heard it the same way that uh that brother Ben brought it on Sunday I just can't stop sorry brother it was just so good you know the the story of the talents the parable of the talents you know there was there was five and and two I think it was and one and you know the first two they were both 100 return on the investment and the next one was the zero return on the investment and we're going to be guilty if we don't have a return on our investment and all it takes is Just Surrender unto the Lord that's the key to it brothers and sisters it's not saying that I need to go and create a whole bunch of money I need to create an empire of wealth to give to the Lord that's not it at all it's a principle behind it giving all that we have to the Lord giving him 100 return on the gifts that he's given us in our lives and that's why I think it's tremendous a great example of it is someone that wants to serve in the body of Christ someone that wants to do something for the body somebody wants to go out and witness for the Lord somebody that wants to to try and do something put their shoulder to the wheel it's a return on on the parable of the uh Talent but here we have this woman in the city of psychar she recognized the woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh which is called the Christ when he has come he will tell us all things she recognized this man before he even said it when he said it he just confirmed all that she was saying because in verse 19 she says the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet I perceive that something in me is telling me that there's something different about you I've heard a lot of different people but wow there's something that you're saying in the way that you're saying it and she goes and talks about her tradition our fathers worshiped in this mountain we've been here for a long time and we've heard a lot of messages we've heard a lot of preachers but there's something about your ministry the words that you're saying are are speaking to my soul in such a way that I've never heard it before and that was the word of God coming across that seed Gene of God that he placed in there like we've talked about from the book of Ephesians before the foundation of the world the woman saith unto him sir I perceive thou art a prophet she recognized there was something about this man our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet Jerusalem worship the father there's come in a time where it's all going to be just scattered and you won't even know who it is that you worship verse 22 ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worship worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him and we know that Jesus said you know what if you don't want to worship it's fine the Rocks themselves will immediately cry out if you don't want to worship and I'm going to get into it eventually we're going to get there but how important is worship brothers and sisters I want to say this I would say it's probably as important to the preaching of the word on this side of Eternity or maybe even a little more because if we don't have worship we are not pleasing the father if we don't have Worship in our services brothers and sisters we could become cold and starchy what does the word of God say that they're lukewarm formal and Powerless we've got to be willing to understand that where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty there's Freedom we're we're not going to go over onto the other side of Eternity and preach the message of the hour we're going to be the message of the hour and the message of the hour is going to be behind us because we're going to be headed to Eternity but first we're going to spend a thousand years showing Satan that he has absolutely powerless he is bound with chains of circumstance where he can't even touch us for a thousand years we're going to go and live out that life that Adam and Eve were supposed to live that's what we're going to do for a thousand years and once that's over brothers and sisters then there's a New Jerusalem City coming down out of heaven and the top of it is going to be just about as high as that space station it's going to be so incredibly big and huge and there's going to be a spot for each one of us our own very special place in that New Jerusalem City and all the kings of the Earth are going to bring their Wares into it there's still going to be people in this world but not one of you not one of us are going to be affected by Satan and his Antics in this world when that time comes but you know this woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh and when he which is called the Christ and I want to say the anointed one because we know brother Bradham preached the false anointing ones at the end time he said there's many christs and they're anointed ones there's many anointed ones in this world even today brothers and sisters but what happened when she recognized what happened when she recognized something happened to her wasn't there she didn't just say wow amen she didn't just sit there and and was cool and said you know just have a nice day it was good to talk to you sir what does the word of God says says that she ran into the city she dropped her water pot she no longer cared about the cares of his life she wanted to let the people know hold on a second something serious is going on here and you all need to hear about it and you know brothers and sisters the same thing for us today when we recognize who it is that we are fellowshipping with in this word it's not brother Barry it's not the the former Pastor it's not a great Minister somewhere else it's not William Mary and Branham when we listen to the message of the hour brothers and sisters that's not William Miriam Brown I'm doing all those signs and wonders that's the Holy Ghost through me William Miriam Branham and you know what it's the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's got to be his life living out through us and when it happens then we'll be the ones running into the city when we recognize that brothers and sisters there's an action that takes place in our lives when we truly have that that experience with the Lord Jesus Christ we're not the same person brother random says it out of it is I be not afraid I thought it was so so fitting and and suiting and I'm probably gonna stay here for a little while just in terms of services coming up but it's just so beautiful brothers and sisters be of good cheer don't worry is of the devil worry is thoughts that come into our mind and we think about things and we think about things and we think about things that never happen sometimes they happen but most times they don't most times it's just a bunch of things that we think about and all it is is things that we think about and it can make us worried it can even make us literally physically sick if we're not careful don't worry brothers and sisters be of good cheer why should you be of good cheer because it is I when we're in the midst of the storm he's going to walk right towards us in this message um a fundamental Foundation of faith brother Bradham he talks about it how Jesus knew exactly where the disciples were he says it in this message it is I be not afraid he knew exactly where the disciples were when that storm was there when they were out in the boat he knew exactly where they were he knew what they were doing he knew what they were thinking he knew what they were saying and what did he do he came to them he didn't just leave him he didn't he this word says I'll never leave you or forsake you he will never leave us brothers and sisters he says now he was dealing with a Samaritan woman and the brethren in the boat said you know what we all thought that he'd been caught in a trap they're trying to trick him try and get Jesus the one who was the Christ who is the Christ in the story but try and trick him and get him together with an ill-famed woman the men of the city the Pharisees of the Sadducees they sent out the woman they weren't Beyond trying to trip him trick them trip them up or trap them right they brought the woman who was caught in the act of adultery and threw him her down at his feet and what did he do he didn't even care he wasn't fussed and they're like oh Master we we we should apply the law in this situation right and what did he say you know whoever has no sin here you can just cast the first stone he without no sin just go ahead you can be first who's going to go who's gonna do it who's gonna throw the first stone and they started to recognize oh man yeah ah drop the stone drop all the stones everyone quietly leave nobody wanted to throw a stone at that point because they all recognized they had a problem every one of us does we can't be throwing stones I saw a meme this week just made me think of it I think it's good to just be natural normal but I saw this Meme and it was a man washing another man's feet while a group of people were sitting there this was from someone who isn't really even a message believer I was surprised maybe I'll try and find it and I'll share it but this man was was washing it was like a cartoon washing a man's foot and it said it's impossible to throw stones when you're washing another man's feet I thought my goodness how pertinent to a Believer today how many times do we miss a communion foot washing brothers and sisters it's an opportunity to actually wash not our brother's feet but to wash the Lord Jesus Christ's feet it's a tremendous opportunity but looking at this uh looking at this story here brother Branham he says he he was dealing with a Samaritan woman and the brother in the boat said you know what we'd all thought that he'd been caught in a trap we wondered what he would do now she denied it she said I have no husband but listen what he said I can hear Andrew say but Brethren you remember what he said he said thou Hast said true you've got five husbands and the one you're living with you're you're you're now living with is not your husband you said well now we thought the Samaritan woman being an evil character five husbands it's pretty terrible an evil character but here we have Jesus sitting there just talking to her and we know that he went there for one reason one woman that's the reason he went there now we thought the Samaritan woman being an evil character that she'd say like the well-trained preachers did say well you must be Beelzebub she knows more about God than a lot of ministers does today she said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet now listen to our words read it Saint John 4 I perceive thou art a prophet we we Samaritans we know that Messiah is coming and the Messiah will tell us these things what's going to be the sign of Messiah that's what's going to be the sign of Messiah sorry but who are you he said I am he that speaks to you and she run into the City and she said come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah isn't that the sign the Messiah was supposed to show the Bible says the men of Samaria believed on him because of what the what a woman told them what he'd done was that Jesus yesterday that be Jesus today if he's the same Messiah much more we could go to we haven't time just talking about this story I think it's just amazing to look at it because when we recognize that God sent a prophet God sent a prophet for a purpose it wasn't so that we could say wow God sent a prophet and I believe that Prophet he's my prophet sure enough he is our Prophet but that Prophet was Eliezer and Eliezer came to introduce Rebecca a type of the Bride to her husband Isaac and again what happened when Ellie easer got her all the way there he brought her gave her all the gifts dealt with her family she had all the signs and wonders all along the way the camel train all the gifts everything happened in her life it was so tremendous and when she finally got there when Ellie easer finally took her to where her husband was she recognized him and as soon as she recognized him there was an action that took place in her life there was a manifestation of that word from Eliezer that's where your husband's gonna be he's going to look like this he's going to be doing that and when that time comes you don't have to wait for anybody and when she got there when she saw him she lighted off of her camel meaning she jumped off and she ran she was no longer interested in what Eliezer had to say about it because she saw him right there her husband her Isaac was right there and he was waiting for her in the evening time and you know what she went into the marriage at that point and it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters when we recognize what it is that we've come in contact with when we recognize that brothers and sisters something happens in our lives and maybe it's not something where we can say I've become a new creature in Christ Jesus because as a child I got baptized in the name of the of of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins that I truly got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was a kid so my whole entire life I felt the same you might feel the same but there might come a time where you actually go out and become adopted son and daughter of God where you truly become verified by the Lord Jesus Christ where the maturity level of the word in your life is there and now you start to see the manifestation of signs and wonders in your life and that is truly the life of a believer in our day William Miriam Branham wasn't the only one some people will say that all of the gifts that William Mary and Bradham had were all for him and that was it and that's where they stopped brothers and sisters I I personally don't believe that I personally believe he was the wave chief that was waived over the congregation for this age he was waived over the Bride of Jesus Christ to say this is what it's going to be when you come to full maturity you're not going to become a prophet because a prophet is a prophet from the womb that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that you will have the same life of Jesus Christ Living out through you you'll have discernments you'll be able to speak in tongues you might even want to run around the building and scream and shout you might want to dance in the spirit you might want to sing in the spirit you might want to actually just speak the word of God Anything is Possible if we don't limit God I think it's just an amazing thing this whole this whole story recognizing it recognizing our day and its message recognizing Who We Are The Bride of Jesus Christ not because of anything we've done because he chose us and how do we be the Bride of Jesus Christ we have to be a virgin right he won't accept anything else but how do we be a virgin when when we can look at our lives spiritually speaking and say that I fell down here and I did this there and this other thing and if you only knew my past oh my goodness it's so checkered how could I ever be a virgin it's got nothing to do with this flesh nothing to do with this flesh and it has absolutely everything to do with our hearts what's on the inside of the inside do we say Amen to this word when it comes across our path if we say Amen to this word when it comes across our path then we are truly a virgin to this word and that's what he's looking for as a virgin to his word not somebody that's going to take this word and try and mingle it with something else and say that I'm just going to make it work the way that I like it to work because that's what suits me and my family you can do that but I uh we can do that but you know brothers and sisters that might put us in a position where we're not sitting in that Throne where we're standing in front of it and the word of God says that it would be better for them to not have known than to actually have gone all that way we don't want to chance it that way I've heard people say that there's going to be other people in that City that that have walked away from church and I think goodness sakes is that really what we're going to do we can't just take the word of God and just put it on the shelf and say I'd rather just live my life according to what I think is going to work we need to follow the word for our day if Rebecca decided to say no I want to just drive the camel just a little bit off the path I want to take the shortcut to go and see Isaac he'd say no no no no no don't do that just just stay with us just stay with us we're going the way we'll get you there it might look longer but we're going to get you there she'd say no no no I remember I got a little road map maybe I got a little GPS maybe somebody told me that if you just go down through the valley and around the corner you'll be able to get to Isaac a little sooner brothers and sisters there's only one way one truth and one life and according to the message of the hour is that way that truth and that life we know that brother Branham was not the son of man he was a man revealing the son of man that's that's what he was doing and if he was revealing the son of man then where is the son of man today if we have the ability to recognize that there's an action that takes place Noah recognized the word of God in his day and he took action there was something that happened and the same thing happens to us in our day sometimes we get the desire to go and preach we never want to Discount that if anybody has the desire to preach that's God working in your heart because I'll promise you this Satan don't want you to preach Satan doesn't want you to preach the word of God so if we have that struggle in our lives and we're wondering oh I just got this thing where I just feel like I should preach Satan doesn't want you to preach it's God out of Investments brother batam says and this little woman had nothing she probably kept away from church she had seen so much in it because down in her heart was laid a seed eternal life brothers and sisters we know in our day we can come to church and we can see a lot and unfortunately we can get real hurt at church things can happen at church and you know Satan comes to church he likes to get in the middle of it and try to give us bars of misunderstandings but you know I would just want to say this brother Brown when he went across the curtain of time what was it that voice said to him that voice said to him keep pressing on when he came back into his body that's the thing that he kept hearing keep pressing on I just want to say it don't matter what happened in church brothers and sisters the grass ain't going to be greener anywhere else just keep pressing on just ask God to actually help the situation and he will and this little woman had nothing she probably kept away from church she had seen so much in it because down in her heart was laid a seed eternal life all that the father has given me will come to me and as soon as that light flashed upon her she didn't call it a devil look at the difference between that woman and the clergy she said sir I perceive thou art a prophet we know that when Messiah cometh that's the things he is to do we're looking for a messiah we haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years but our leader Moses told us that there would raise up a prophet in the last days and he would be Messiah which means the anointed one anointed excuse me he was the word God is the word and was in Christ and the Bible said that the word of God the word is quicker more powerful sharper than a two-edged sword Hebrews 4 piercing asunder the marrow of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and intents that's in the heart that's the reason he could look upon them and perceive what they were thinking about because he was the word he was life he is still the word and he is still life and he knew and he does the same thing I want to say this brothers and sisters he is the same thing he knows exactly what's in our hearts right now he knows exactly what's in our minds right now we cannot hide from him we can hide from my brothers and our sisters sometimes we can even hide from ourselves but we can't hide from God he knows exactly what our thoughts are and we have the ability to receive him or to reject him and I just want to encourage every one of us to receive him isn't it interesting though to look at the parallels of this she knew that there was someone coming she knew that there was a messiah coming she knew that there was a Christ coming and she wasn't interested in trying to say well I thought that it should come this way because he was able to discern her heart who had been able to discern her heart in the past nobody nobody had ever been able to discern her heart isn't that interesting to take a look at the ministry of William Miriam Branham I had the the opportunity this week to to witness to someone we have it's so strange there's no accidents in this world I love the way God does stuff we had a man drive into our driveway and ask if he could board some horses at our property and uh I guess they used to do that there for a time but we we got talking and he started to speak about uh things that that were interesting and Time stuff and we started to talk about the vaccine and and the pandemic and different things and I thought you know this is tremendous I love this conversation and he said what did you do with your congregation how did you deal with it because I told him I was a minister and I said you know what we just said what what God Said what Jesus said just Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's but give God what's God gods we didn't try to rock the boat we're not trying to prove anything we want to see people get to Christ that's what we want to see Christ in our day not Christ of of an imagination but Christ in our day is tremendous so I I told him you know I asked him the question I said if God sent a prophet to the Earth today would you want to hear what he had to say and he said oh yes I would and I said oh good great and he said well what what what what are you talking about I said well just just take a look at William Mary and Branham I said I can I can explain more about it and he typed it into his phone right away and I said okay you know what you're going to do you're going to find a whole bunch of fanaticism that's going to be the first thing that you find but what I want to say is just take what you actually see about him and compare it with the word of God because he has a knowledge of the word of God compare it with the word of God and see if it's true or not and uh we'll see and I said you know what I'd love to have a further conversation with you and he said sure enough I would and he sent me a text message after hours after and he was really warm about it he said this is tremendous I've never heard of this before I would like to talk about this so uh just remember this fella I can't remember his name offhand but um I think it's Lyle but just remember the the man with the horses and we'll just see what the Lord will do but you know there's something about the word for our day brothers and sisters and and there's people in this world that still need to hear about it and we have the opportunity to go running into the city to explain to them that God sent a prophet that this Messiah has come that he's not coming he's already come and people have a perception in their mind about what he should be like what's going to look like what's going to happen and what it is it's bars of misunderstanding it's going to keep people behind those bars but we've had a profit in our day say House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ not give way to the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost give way to the name of Jesus Christ this woman here she recognized it even though she was a fitful sinner she was in a bad State wasn't she an ill-famed woman with five husbands an evil character is what brother Branham said but something on the inside of her was able to recognize it and when she recognized it she acted on it and when she acted on it what happened all the men of the city came out to meet Jesus how many people are in the city of Calgary brothers and sisters I think it's a tremendous thing but here we have in our day for people maybe that don't know this I know that we all know this here but what about Revelations 10. one to seven so familiar scripture to us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel messenger when he should begin to sound when are those days I just want to ask the question when when is that going to happen and we know everyone here knows maybe people watching already know it's already happened but many people are still thinking this is out there in the future when it's already taken place and the days of the seventh angel messenger when he begins to sound what's going to happen the mystery of God will be finished in our day brothers and sisters it's happened I just want to encourage us tonight don't don't don't discount it if you have the ability to hear this and recognize this for your day throw down your pot run into the City and go and tell the men of the city what you know what you've heard about there's still people in the City of Calgary I thought it was amazing brother Ben asked how many people in the City of Calgary would go if there was a Rapture today who knows the answer to that we don't know that but we know this that God said through that Prophet you you be that one screaming and crying Lord be it unto me according to your word let me be that one that goes in the rapture brothers and sisters can we recognize where we are today in our lives today in our message today in the word of God we know that we have to plant our potatoes we have to hoe our potatoes is what the prophet said which means we have to do our gardening we have to go to work we have to go to school we got to pay bills we got to pay taxes we got to Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's but we need to give unto God what's God's and you know I would say this we need to give unto God what's God's and then Render unto Caesar what's Caesars and we could get into all of that with tithes and offerings you can pay your taxes first but what if you tithe first God will bless you beyond your wildest imagination there's a whole thing about that too someday we'll get into but you know brothers and sisters can we recognize it today can we recognize who has come and set down by our will and said to us you know what it doesn't matter I'm not concerned about all of that I want you to know that I know all about you I want you to know very clearly that there's nothing hidden in your life but none of it matters I want you to know that if you can receive this word for your day then none of that matters because you're not living under law you're receiving Grace the grace that's given to you in my presence and you know what that's the way the Lord is he's not looking to destroy us he's looking to save us Satan wants us to think that he's looking to destroy us brother Branham said I used to think that that God was mad at me and Jesus loved me and come to find out one day that they were the same person that they just want to love us they're just knocking at the door hoping that someone on the inside would just open the door to us just turn that latch and allow him to come in and these word of God says that if you do you open that door then I'll come in and I'll sup with you you won't eat alone you know brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us tonight if we can recognize it I'll call the musicians as I close this if we can recognize that brothers and sisters then every single promise in the book Is Ours every single promise in the word of God is yours and you have every single right to it and I want to say this when a devil comes around and tries to tell you that you don't have the right to it tell him he's a liar when the Devil comes around and tries to say that I've got right to it tell him he's a liar because when Christ went to Calvary he died he went down into hell and he took those keys of death and hell right off of Satan's belt and and we know that he knows that it was made very very clear we don't have to accept the devil in his Antics is what I want to say tonight brothers and sisters if we've accepted this word in its fullness then we have right to every single promise the full entire book is completely revealed to us maybe stand with me tonight as we close through this ministry in our day brothers and sisters all that was lost in the fall has been restored we've gone right back to that perfect state of the Garden of Eden spiritually speaking here we are in this world living in this flesh dealing with all this sin the God of this evil age Satan's Eden this terrible nature that we're born into but yet somehow God has chosen us to be here and he chose us to be here to be the ones to say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I recognize what he's done for me I recognize this word for my day that the mystery is no longer a mystery it's completely revealed and I might not totally understand it but I do understand this that he has called me by my name and you know when he's called you by your name nobody can ever talk you out of it because nobody ever talked you into it let's just pray tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just pray that we can all recognize who it is that we are talking to Father Lord Jesus help me to recognize it Lord help me to recognize you father Lord I've had conversations with brothers and and I know that I'm the same way I'll get caught up in the circumstances of this life and then eventually after much heartache something will say but have you prayed father help me to not wait for a traumatic experience to pray oh Lord but help me to just have that that that constant communion with you father I pray that would be every one of our experience Lord to just have a constant communion with you Lord and understand who you really are in this age that you're not some dirty old grandpa living out on some other Universe floating around on clouds but Lord that you are truly alive and well in the hearts of your children Lord father help us to recognize our position because we know when that day comes when we fully recognize it Lord then the Rapture will go we know there's many many miles to go father many lives that need to come in many people that need to hear the Cry of that woman from the well that knows that Messiah has come father help us to recognize the fullness of the coming of Messiah father we love you and we thank you tonight we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us Lord be with those who are traveling Lord bring them back home safely at the appointed time we just pray that you'd be glorified now in all that's said and done as we close the service father and if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday we pray that you would just anoint us father one more time Lord with your word and hearts to receive that word for our day we love you we thank
