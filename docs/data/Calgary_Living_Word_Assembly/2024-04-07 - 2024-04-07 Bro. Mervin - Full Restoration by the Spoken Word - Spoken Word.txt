reports I believe the Lord he likes to hear thank you daddy's like to hear thank you amen and we have a praise report from Sister Rebecca snow about Brother David Smith he had a bad March 9th he broke all the ribs on his right side fractured his right shoulder fractured vertebrae he had a grapefruit sized H chuma on the tailbone he was very sick very injured March the 12th we prayed for him March

was up in a brace I apologize but what a mighty God we serve amen I would also like to bring a praise report uh yesterday we were on our way to the gym for the event for the families and we were driving past the Rocky View Hospital and my sister who was in there I knew she was in there and I said to Lisa I said I I need to go there I need to go and see my sister I can't explain it I just know I need to go there today so I dropped the family off at the gym and I went back to the hospital and what I found was that she was being released as I got there so I was able to drive her home [Applause] she had sepsis and uh she had a kidney stone and the infection got on the kidney stone and infected her kidney and she was very sick the doctor said that 46% of the people with that illness die and uh so we're certainly thankful I told told her we prayed I could bring her things and do things but the only thing that really makes a difference is prayer oh my so I just want to thank each and everyone who took the time to pray for her it means a lot for me if you could continue to pray for my sister Aaron that the Lord would not just heal her body right but now that she can see he can

and as we feed on we have to express it amen and we're so thankful barar gave us that uh opportunity to to unload the the burden amen and we when we are fully loaded we want to we want to explode if we don't unload it amen and as long as we're feeding the word amen it's good it's good for growth maturity amen and uh I'll try this if it will it will go oops okay so there's some technicalities here he doesn't want to go to the next one bear with me here I don't know Josh okay maybe I'll just say next slide or something yeah so full restoration by the spoken word we just uh had a great uh meetings with the Brother David dinh har and he amen he reminded us amen we didn't hear anything new because we know we've been uh feeding on the message of the hour and if we heard something new then there's something wrong right right we're not parroting the or we're parroting the prophet of this age because uh he gave us the instruction on how we can live a full life according to the word amen we don't put a hybrid word we don't feed on hybrid word because that's not good so it's a it's something like uh we need to be restored because that's the word of the Lord amen because we we lost it before but then God is faithful by election He restored us amen by his full word so full restoration by the spoken word next slide please uh while you're standing let's let's read Joel 1 1 to4 the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pel Amen hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land had this been in your days or even even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation you can see here it's a passing of generation amen amen that which the Palmer worm had left had the Locust eaten and that which the locus had had had left had the conquer conquer worm eaten and that which the Conqueror worm had left had the C caterpillar eaten you can see here it's a death they being eaten Joel 22526 and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the conquer worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen may the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so full restoration by the spoken word so just put uh let's uh put a foundation in it uh let's go with the next slide here amen uh paragraph 83-85 the restoration of the Bride tree amen now BR Bram is saying in in this message the restoration of the Bride tree that's what Webster says the word restore means to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition bringing back to the former owner it means it's like uh Redemption right when you pawn something it can only be redeemed by the owner and uh I preached last time here in uh last year during during the Easter justification you are made righteous but then the other meaning of it is you are fully owned amen so you cannot be made righteous if you're not own because all his will be called will be pulled towards him amen and if you are his amen that's right you will be called No Matter What amen you will be brought back to the to your former owner which is God himself amen and that is only by election brothers and sisters not by our own might not by our own works not by our own understanding it's by his election by his grace alone not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone amen and if I claim if and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place amen this is beautiful brothers and sisters because we were restored by the message of the hour Amen to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs thank God the Lord we belong to him amen therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner amen we were Sinners all of us we were just we were just saved by his grace alone amen and when we did know that we are his when we accepted the message of the hour when we received the Holy Ghost and then the spiritual Amnesia was cured amen amen we know now who we are amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural state amen where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition and in order to do this we have a right to enforce amen we can enforce our rights we can uh if if there's a squatter in the land it has been preached many times we can enforce the the law amen because that is our rightful possession amen amen if there is a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner into its liable First Estate amen amen before the foundation of the world brothers and sisters I'm not preaching anything new it's just for us to be reminded amen we're so thankful unto him that uh uh we have a prophet God sent a prophet and it's important to hear that Prophet amen and I have a lot of scriptures here to show we will be teaching and preaching so that at least it can put a a great foundation in our faith do we what do we really believe okay God sent a prophet is is that the end right no God sent a prophet for a purpose amen is what to declare his word amen for us to be matured grow fully amen so bear with me if we will read a lot of scriptures and I think that's the purpose of our being here is to feed on scriptures and feed on the quotes for for the message of the hour amen just to prove it nothing new Isaiah 11:12 just to prove to you that the word comes through prophets you can see here Isaiah 1112 the vision of Isaiah amen the son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and J Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah jotham ahas and ezekiah kings of Judah so you see vision of Isaiah Vision prophets have visions amen amen here o heavens and give here o Earth for the Lord hath spoken so it's just like th said the Lord amen I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me next slide Jeremiah 1112 I'm putting all the prophets here the book of prophets if you can see all their starting messages or scriptures it's about the words of the Lord through the prophet amen Jeremiah 11:12 the words of Jeremiah this is the words of Jeremiah saying right the son of Hil of the priest that were in an anath in the land of Benjamin to whom who is that whom to Jeremiah the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah in the 13th year of his Reign that's Jeremiah I'm just talking about the the Major Prophets here and we can go with the Minor Prophets as well Ezekiel he said at the end of verse one I saw visions of God and and then verse three the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest we know he's a priest but at the same time he's also a prophet the son of buai in the land of Chalan by the river chibar and the Hand of the Lord was there upon Him amen Hosea 1 one the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea you can see here and then Joel 111 the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pel obadah the vision of obadia th said the Lord God concerning Edom you can see there's a pattern here brothers and sisters the word of the Lord comes through prophets am the word of God they are not God but the word of God comes through the prophets amen and we believe yes right the prophet for our AIDS that's why amen we reap the benefits amen of what he receive amen and if you're the bride the bride means there's a bride and the bridegroom is living in US amen so Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophet so you see brothers and sisters I'm just putting a foundation here and then we will read lots of quotes hopefully you will not be bored with quotes we've been reading a lot of quotes which is good so that you know that where it came from right so at least we are safe no one can criticize us that we're preaching a different thing but you can see here he's very just brothers and sisters right the Lord is just he reveal it his secret unto his servants the prophets and he will not do nothing until he reveal it amen and we are given the chance brothers and sisters to hear the word to hear the message of the hour while still there's breath in our lungs we have the Hope amen and we are the hope of our brothers and sisters our relatives our colleagues everyone that we will meet amen amen so we will read some quotes here Christ is revealed in his own word it will be a little bit of a long read but uh bear with me just just to show that BR Branham although he said that I'm not a prophet but we know he's the prophet amen otherwise we will not be believing him but uh we see there is a change why do we believe a prophet because it change our lives and it brought us back to the word of God fully amen amen he's a word prophet amen and it's important to know which prophet we will believe so Christ is revealed in his own word paragraph 118 amen now we realize then that God sent His prophets amen that was the way he had of bringing his word to the people and notice you know Moses this time is he's talking about Moses you know Moses said if you want to read it in Exodus the 4th chapter and the 10th and 12th verse MO Moses said God spoke to him amen God talked to a man lip to ear amen that's how prophets work amen they hear it lip to ear amen and he said I'm slow of speech Moses said I'm not sufficient I can't go he said who made man to talk or who made him dumb who made him to see or who made him to hear then I the Lord said I'll be with you with your mouth see next slide and Jeremiah this time is Jeremiah said and if you want to read that in Jeremiah 1:6 Jeremiah said that God put words in my mouth so you see we cannot just say our own words amen because our words don't mean nothing if they are not according to the word of God Amen see he talked lip to ear with one prophet and spoke through the other prophet he had no control at all and spoke through his lips we're so thankful that bar branam just uh uh you know he he surrendered his life amen that's why God was able to use him because a fully surrendered man is omnipotent amen and he can use only a fully dead person amen this still I'm I'm putting a foundation here because these are very rich and uh I just hope you are okay to read them amen one to one he got he's got ways of getting his word out you know yes sir you see the Bible is God's word not man's word amen 121 Moses said God spoke to me with a voice and I heard him I wrote down what he said amen we're so thankful that he wrote down otherwise we won't have anything written now beautiful Jeremiah said I couldn't speak at all and the first thing you know my lips was talking amen and I was writing God spoke through his lips and it come to pass yes that's the Vindication of a prophetic message amen it will come to pass we've been yeah brother don't talk about it bra talk about it the the the written word the spoken word and the manifestation amen it's so important if it doesn't come to pass not yet maybe right but it will come to pass otherwise that word is not coming from a prophet and it's not the word itself amen it must come to pass amen and this message we know it Chang Our Lives amen no one can steal our testimony it's our personal amen did it change you did it it changed my life I know amen the old mvin was dead amen I hope your your old self was dead too amen we we talk about two Natures amen the old nature and the new nature the old nature we know is the flesh amen Romans 8 Romans 7 end of seven but then once you cross eternity it's Romans 8 you see the seven and eight these are numerals in the Bible then they are very important imagine one verse away one one chapter away but you're Crossing eternity you might not be in eternity now but you're Eternal amen because whether you live or you die chist you're Christ you'll be Crossing eternity amen and it's just a vehicle death is just a vehicle so that we can cross over another dimension amen don't be afraid of death amen amen but physical death is important so that God can use us amen yes it is amen oh God is so good amen next uh quote sorry but these are so rich that I I wanted to to read them 123 you know the Old Testament alone it's more than 2,000 times those prophets said th said the Lord amen now if a man said that's said the lord it's not the man talking right amen if he would he wouldn't be a prophet amen he'd be a hypocrite see cuz it wouldn't never come to pass one chance out of 10,000 times see they might guess but it's thus said the Lord the Lord God has said it amen if I would say thus said or man Neville my brother say that's said Mr man I'd say that's said brother Veil out here or some other other Brethren any of you I'm speaking what you said if I'm truthful I'm saying just what you said amen and this man being Prophet said it's not time I have nothing to do oh it's not me he said it's not me I have nothing to do with it but it is thus set the Lord so the Bible is thus set the Lord Brother s by whom by the prophets that's why we believe the prophets it's so important brothers and sisters I have a lot more bear with me notice they took Christ Spirit upon themselves and forast you see the events that would come to pass talk about forecasts so forecast right because they they can prophesy the the future amen the prophetic insights amen and we know and we're given that word amen and they said what would take place down Through the Ages as they set stood laid walked with the spirit of Christ upon them in so much that they acted like Christ and the readers would read it and think that the prophets was speaking of themselves that's not the the thing you remember the Uno when he was reading Isaiah 53:1 about how that he that he had wounded he had wounded for our transgressions Bruce for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we were healed the Uno said to Phillip who is the prophet speaking of himself or other men see the prophet spoke as it is it was himself amen but it's the word of the Lord amen amen yes look at David crying my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me my bones they stare at me at David they pierced my feet and my hands they pierc my feet and my hands but thou will not live my soul in Hell neither Willl thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption as though David was speaking of himself being holy it was the son of David that gerti amen spiritual seed coming down through here though David himself was a cockle bir the flesh is a cockle bir right but on the inside Hallelujah of there was a wheat grain you get it it's not a cockle bir from the beginning but this flesh is like our our flesh that's why it needs to be born again right it needs to be changed because it's a cockal bur but the thank the Lord God planted the seed the wheat seed in US amen so the whole Bible is the the word of man neither was it wrot by man brought by man or neither can it be revealed by man it's God's word amen revealed by God himself Hallelujah his own interpreter Christ revealing himself in his own word oh brothers and sisters I still have more here so the last one here how the word of God so perfect trust in it folks it's the only thing that can save you amen it's not the word of man brothers and sisters it's the word of God Amen next slide God speaking himself through the prophets it's so good here because uh the topic is God spoke through prophets and uh that's how Christ is revealed amen amen it's by his own word in his own word amen God Speak himself through the prophets see they absolutely it it isn't the prophets it was God Amen because the prophet themselves they could they couldn't say those things who has believed believed our report Isaiah saying you see who has beli our report you see even the power of prayers the praise reports here amen it's it's the prayers of the Saints here and and and of course uh whoever is praying that God we we tapped on on God's laboratory and he heard and he heard our prayers amen there's a power there amen there's a power and and and when we are sick who who are we going to believe amen it's we believe the report of the Lord amen not not the doctor's report Amen to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he shall grow up before us as a cough in a stall and how that yet he was wounded for our transgressions amen bruis for our iniquity Chas chastisement of our peace upon him with his stripes we are healed amen so you see the cross of Calvary has two two Co covenants there for salvation and for healing amen amen it's so it's so good to to to know that uh he he gave his life for us amen for our salvation and for our healing we were healed way over here in this age here and Isaiah back y 800 years before Christ by stripes we were pastent amen already here amen oh my how the word of God so perfect trust in it folks it's the only thing that can save you amen so good so good amen and even in uh Galatians uh 1 1:8 if an angel would come to you from Heaven we've been talking about it if it's already said if it's already spoken that's it amen amen and even an angel from heaven will come and and say different thing he will be a cursed amen so it's very important brothers and sisters to know where we stand and to know what word We Will We Will Follow amen and it's according to the word for for our day amen the last uh last quote here 129 page 18 brother well now you know he's a good God he didn't say he wouldn't you know but surely oh me there he is and if he was deceitful like that and the Bible said in the last days he would deceive the elected if it was possible where ought we to be today friends now this little Sunday school lessons are should be carried pretty close you know to our hearts to see we ought to listen real close and see how deceiving that thing is we will be deceived I mean the elected will not be deceive amen if if it was possible but for us it will not be possible but how can we not be deceived because we have everything in front of us we have the message of the hour on our tablet I forgot my phone all my notes are there but God is good I know it will bring it to to my remembrance and then that's good it means I will not preach on my notes it will be preached according to his leadership amen notice we cannot we must must not this is a warning to us listen to any other man's word right we don't care how smart how educated the Bible in Proverbs says we must cast down reasonings we cannot reason on the word brothers and sisters amen we cannot isolate coat and then live with it and run with it we need to have the full message of the hour amen amen and sometimes we we we we are guilty in uh oh this will justify what I'm doing because BR Bram said this but how about the other things that he said but how about the word BR branam is always giving us the direction go back to the word amen go back to the full word amen don't don't think if if what I said is against the word leave it alone amen we were we were given that instruction so now we'll go to the topic that's a foundation so it means every everything comes through prophets the word comes through prophets amen amen and we're so thankful Ezekiel 37 1-14 this is uh basically my T because the the restoration by the spoken word you can see here that's a a this is a a very very strong uh or or you can say familiar scripture that we have uh read before but uh let's dissect it and uh it will be a like a Sunday school with preaching amen Ezekiel 37 1-4 oh 1 to4 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry so you see setting the the theme or the uh the setting of The of this eek Ezekiel 37 he was uh carried out in the spirit of the Lord amen and he was in the midst of the valley and they were full of Bones amen so it means many dead people right and then in the second verse and caus me to pass maybe if you can put the the thing here brother I mean my my slide in instead of the individual one so at least we can see the the highlights here if you can see the first two verses here he is in the midst of the valley amen and and an open Valley and there were bones they were very dry so it means they're dead amen very dry bones it means inanimate thing no life at all amen and he said unto me son of man son of man a prophet so we we're trying to to check the restoration by the spoken word through the prophet here amen and and he's a son of man this is Ezekiel it's the Lord talking to the son of man and he said unto me son of man can this bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest that's a good answer brothers and sisters if we think that we know everything we are in trouble amen it means we cannot be taught amen amen it's better to say I don't know rather than saying something and then we we actually don't know and he said unto me can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest amen it's only the Lord who knows everything again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord prophesy prophetic something being said amen something being uh uh you know forecast amen but then he's talking to dry bones prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord but you know where the pun line here is how can they hear if they don't have any ears they're bones amen amen they are bones nothing very dry very dry bones inanimate things but he was commanded to prophesy unto them amen talk to them and then verse five thus said the Lord God unto this bones behold I will cause breath to enter you and you shall live amen so let let's go deeper amen okay now it's working the hand of the Lord oh sorry verse 6 and I will lay Senus upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord hallah so you see here there's a process he will lay Senus I will lay Senus upon you and bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord there's a process there brothers and sisters we'll just continue so I prophesied as I was commanded as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone first process bone to his bone you see the these are many bones these are many people brothers and sisters think of it as the bride of Christ with many bones but he said the bones came together bone to his bone with this uh word the proper bones came because bones came can be scattered right that's the setting right we have different locations but it came when he spoke the bones came to the proper bone so it means the bone of brother Paul will not go to brother Henry's bone right and each and everyone so we will have our own bones we will be set in order right because the flesh cannot come into a different bone you know you know what I'm saying what what I'm saying here is bone bone to his bones proper bone to his bone brother Henry's bone Brother Paul's bones will come together amen that's the first step but it can only come to pass as it has been prophesied as it's been spoken by the prophet amen amen and when I beh beheld L the Second Step the Senus and the flesh came up upon them so you see if if it's a different bone if it's a missing bone by itself it cannot be it it must be a full Bone full structure of a of a human being before the Senus and the flesh can come upon them amen proper order brothers and sisters but it's the word of the Lord that can only make that happen amen the third one is the skin covered them above so you see that's the third step but there was no breath in them so it means it's just a flesh bones of his bones flesh of his flesh but there's no breath in them so the fourth step then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind that's the fourth step brothers and sisters prophesy it's always prophesy because we the bride has a Ministry in this last age is to prophesy again in Revelations 10:8 to11 amen prophesy means to teach and preach the Full Gospel the message of the hour prophesy unto the wind John 3 we know the wind bloweth if you want to be born again you you must have the Holy Spirit In You amen because uh uh New Birth is revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus said the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breath up and breathe upon this Lane that they may live amen so you see the the last verse here on on on the tent so I prophesied as he commanded me so you see the prophet Ezekiel is just following the instruction from the Lord he cannot say anything different he was commanded same for the message uh for the prophet of thisa he was commanded to to forerun the second coming Amen to bring back to the full word amen not partial word but to tithe the Loose Ends and everything amen so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them amen and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army oh amen look at that what uh because of his spoken word amen so you can see here if you if you think about it he was prophesying to the bones Dry Bones very dry they are dead inanimate so what can we conclude there that it's the one Speaking that can bring forth the Dead the inanimate objects it's the faith of God in this Prophet right that made them alive it's not the faith in God but the faith of God it was uh preached many times that the faith of God is important and how how faith comes by hearing and Ezekiel we can see here he heard the word of the Lord he understood the word of the Lord and for us when we hear the word of God then the faith of God will be in us a and we can prophesy amen and we can make things happen that's why the restoration by Spoken Word it's very powerful brothers and sisters I want to encourage each and every one of us because we have that power potentially brother Bram is sake it's already in US amen we we must we must and uh we we must heed to that uh word amen through the prophet amen so you can see here then he said to me verse 11 son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts you see brothers and sisters here our hope is lost that's the only thing God can work on our lives when our hope is already lost when we when we uh typically a human being will try to solve especially in North America we think that we have everything we have need of nothing because we are rich right but we are poor actually amen amen but then the thing is the Lord can only can only work on our lives when our loss is totally lost amen amen when we when we already surrendered ourselves unto him amen therefore prophesy and say unto them thus said the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Gades and bring you into the land of Israel we know this is physical Israel but spiritual Israel we are we are the spiritual seed amen and you can see out of our Graves out of for us this this is a grave actually this flesh because it needs to it needs to be changed that's the reason why it's a it's a flesh it's corruptable Amen it must be chained amen and shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves and shall put my spirit in you which Spirit the holy spirit amen and ye shall live that's the only thing that can make us alive is is his spirit amen and I shall place you in your own land adoption amen then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it said the Lord so you see it's all about him amen not us we are just his tools we're just we know we're the bride he cannot uh he's perfect with us amen and we're perfect with him because there's Unity at that day you shall know that I in my father and the father in me and ye in me and I in you what's that Oneness right it means he's not perfect without us he's the head we are the body amen it's so good to understand that uh you can see here the pro the Ezekiel 37 is about order right before the breath can come in everything must be in place even with our lives brothers and sisters before the Holy Ghost can come in our lives should be in order amen amen otherwise even small things we always talk about it little foxes spoil the the vine amen those little things brothers and sisters they they matter because even even the even the message of this hour he tied the Loose Ends not the big uh big doctrines of justification s sanctification or baptism of the Holy Ghost he tied the Loose Ends because they are important it's honing time right we need to be shaped In His Image amen we all those imperfections in our bodies in our in our character amen they need to be cut and and honed we need to be home to his image amen the image and likeness of His Image amen you see here just tie tying in this uh Ezekiel 37 with the the restoration of the brighter in the message it's so good when uh when you read the scripture and then the message of the hour will just du tail uh uh because the message of the hour is none other than the Bible itself it's just a tool for us so that we will understand the the Bible you cannot just say that oh it's already revealed the you don't need a prophet but how can you how can you understand the message without the prophet he is our magnifying glass he our compass pointing us to the North Star right right it's not and if it doesn't point to the North Star then it's a different message right so that's why we have to place this properly the absolute is the word amen the message was used so that we can go to the absolute amen you you can see here just dub tailing here with this four de Messengers listen real close now look there was four four death Messengers killed that tree the bride tree amen that's right what was it palmerworm Locus conqueror caterpillars is that right four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree dogmas and Creeds oh nanism we know we're in the study of the seven Church ages he will give more details on it amen but uh this is just a bit of a summary I have 30 minutes I I'll hurry so amen are are you okay brothers and sisters it's so good this message is Rich that we Cann just uh uh exhaust it but we we thank the Lord that we still have this chance to to know it amen I hope you're still enjoying amen am amen four death Messengers killed that tree Palmer w worm Locus conqueror caterpillar is that right four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree amen one took its fruit one took its bark took its leaves one took its bark one took the life oh is that right four messengers of dogmas killed the tree all but the roots amen The Roots is still there because when you have the seed you have the seed amen and four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree oh thank you Lord amen we have the four messengers of life for God said I will restore it amen if God said so be it that's it amen no ifs no ends no buts amen no reasoning about it right he will restore it he will restore the bride Amen to its proper position to its proper place he's going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification amen you see here uh it's a process again we we'll talk about process and even timeline amen what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the gifts the holy the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost but we don't stop there what's the fourth the word what the word there were four great prophets brother brothers and sisters restoration of the full word that's what we are living on right now amen amen it has been uh all all of these processes are very required so that the Holy Ghost himself can can come upon us and live in us and we're the one representing him amen wherever we go isn't that beautiful the word the word himself amen o so good so good brothers and sisters I'll I'll I'll be a little bit uh slow because these are very next slide brother it doesn't want to go again next slide yeah okay one of them Martin Luther he begin to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along come Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great in another great prophet see but in the last days amen of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word amen because he's a word Prophet that's why we believe in BR Branham amen the word of the Lord came to the prophet so you see we're we're just trying to dub tail all these things together in the evening light is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God forth light amen that's very important four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restore her back again thank the Lord amen hallelujah amen so you see the the Commandment again prophesy son of man can this bones live wish we had time I got it right down here but I have to miss that prophesy can this bones live what's the fourth what what are the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the S senor knew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life amen so you see it's a process when when we are in order then the message of life will come in amen I will restore said the Lord Allelujah Glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the p sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal amen we're not against the Pentecost the Pentecostal but they denominated right we're against the organization amen the way the way they denominated amen but uh we love the people amen amen but the the denomination of Pentecostal is is is the issue it's not the Pentecost Pentecost is uh you know uh having the spirit of God in us amen 513 what the fourth was the word itself it's just to to emphasize clearly that it's the word coming the bride coming amen the second coming of the Bride is is a timeline it doesn't happen in only in 1963 it's happening right now because we are in the Rapture amen and when you're in the Rapture you canot go out of the rapture but the culmination is the meeting in the air amen and that's what we are looking for amen the chains of bodies happening right now amen it didn't stop uh or it's not an event it's a timeline it's a it's a process amen amen what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted amen sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out as Christ has again centered himself like the cup of the pyramid amen I have that uh in the next slide first line justification amen sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then what then coming of the cup amen it's a process am th perfection I I believe so and then the fourth one is you can see is a living the life itself what is it that God that the Holy Ghost 5 on4 what is it the that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can be it can fit with the same kind of ministry fitting so you see the mortar there's no mortar between the the cap and the and the pyramid I'll show you after he had he had when he went away that when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified and baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again yes the tree of life is growing again amen it's being restored so I added more here because we we read Ezekiel 37 so we know this is very important and we know as a hole it will be a hole that's the cap and this bottom here must be equal to this bottom here so that it can fit otherwise there will be uh there will be holes or licks right so I think it's brother meno who who preached that there's no mortar between this and here and Barberry expounded on that that this is a whole pyramid now amen this is the body but this is Jesus Christ the head amen but you can see here it's a process it's a maturing thing we need to so that we can we can bear fruit right it it has to go to the uh the the WID it has go through the stock tassel Shack and then the the wheat itself amen from rotten seed to matur seed which is a Rapture seed raptured seed amen but if I will connect it to to ezekiel's uh thir Ezekiel 37 very dry bones death we we know that uh through through Through the Ages until until tayra we call it dark ages because of doctrines bra Bram is saying even uh it's in the church seven Church ages it died out because of doctrines because of uh dogmas because of uh the nanism uh bism everything and then there's no T is Dark Ages amen so it means it's just like a very dry bones there's no life in it but then the message of Life comes through the bones sinu skin is through Luther Wesley and bar Branham here and then now we will have the great the Breath of Life restored great Army which is the bride age we have brother brother David just uh reemphasized uh the bride AIDS we're living in the bride AGS right now brothers and sisters though we see the loudy out there we're living up here on the bride AIDS and you can see here this is where we're living it's the bride coming of Jesus Christ in the of you and me amen it's very important to see all this uh uh process that uh when you think that uh something it hurts right when when God is correcting us correction is is good for us CH chastisement we need those even even the oysters we we I just checked uh it's just a simple thing is uh it came out of wounds in the Oyster that produces the pearls so it means uh yeah you can you can search that that it's good so all these wounds all these uh trials afflictions they're important to us so that we can produce pearls or pearl of great price amen amen so anyway so the proper the proper uh process is it has to go bones to his bones and then sinus of and flesh and then skin and then it will be restored the the life the the breath of life it will each and every one of us we are great armies not only it's on not one bride it's many member body amen I I have some uh uh science trivia here I I I just thought uh it's so nice to share uh so you know that uh we have a cardiovascular system in the body in our body right cardiovascular means uh it's it's a network it's a system so it's it's composed of members of the of the cardio or you can say organs and the main main organ there is the heart and the Heart con uh is connected through blood vessels arteries coming out of the heart to individual organs and veins to go back to the heart but in between in between the the connection of the arteries and and veins they are capillaries and science is saying I checked it in J gbt Google everywhere they are around 100,000 kilomet of blood vessels the length Okay the distance you think of 100,000 kilometers if you think about it when you're driving it's typically average of 20,000 kilometers per year so if you drive today you will be there in 2029 if if you will model the the the length of the the blood vessels right so what so but what are the per or or or the functions of these blood vessels is to bring and and uh I mean to to send blood to each organ right to each part of the body right so that they can have oxygen so that they live amen and uh long story short of this is uh we need to make our vessels blood vessels to be unclogged because most sicknesses are caused by not having the the blood flowing through that part of the body spiritually if we are disconnected we might not receive blood from the heart so it means we need to to be part of a body of the body so that we can function properly right amen so how can we make this vessels unclogged science is saying eat the right diet balanced diet I'm I'm guilty I love sweets amen I'm sure many are right not full of cholesterol exercise uh regularly which I'm struggling right but physically what's that feeding the word right amen right if you natural types the spiritual I I was just amazed by by this trivia here science trivia which is so important that if you disconnect or something is clogged then that portion or organ or part of that body will will suffer right so so how to unag that channel is to eat the right word not hybrid word amen right pure word amen amen if it is a hybrid with cholesterol High fats right all these things GMO right genetically modified we don't want those we want the full word that's coming from the mouth of God amen amen it's so important and exercise what exercise our faith amen through what through prayers we we we've seen a lot of uh praise reports brothers and sisters it's almost impossible to think that uh uh you know uh brother or sister uh Snow's brother he fell broken ribs and everything and now he's discharged there's power in that brothers and sisters but we need to be connected to the body amen it's very important that uh we need to be there amen we need to be connected amen and so that the blood can flow through US amen it's so important so you can see it's a process amen and what once everything is in Pro proper order then the life can come in amen that's why the bride AIDS is so important to to understand where we stand right now amen let so I know I I talk about this last time so you can see Ephesus 118 years but loud this is already 119 years but we know we're living in the bride age right now but laa as we can see out there is is still laa but we are seeing it because we have that prophetic Insight we have the Flying Eagle anointing that we can see what's going on that's why for us we already Eternal amen because we have Christ in us that's why whether we live or we die we will we will cross eternity so you can see here it already passed Ephesus brother Bram is saying L DEA will be a quick age you can see here the corn of wheat listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age very important I will keep encouraging you and keep uh uh telling this that we need the prophet of this age amen what he says from God the bride will say so you see pting the prophet is not a problem it's not a it's not a it's not an issue we don't need to make it look good or sound good we just have to to to say what he says amen because you see Ezekiel he he just followed What the Lord said to him prophesy so did he say anything no so it's so important for us brothers and sisters we know we if you mix this with psychology there there will be a problem it's a hybrid amen same for our organs in the body they will be sick if it is a hybrid food that we eat amen it it will not be a good flowing Blood Bad circula uh circulation amen yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride amen will be saying the same thing am Hallelujah and what they will say will have already been said in the word we're just repeating what the word says brothers and sisters they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate the shock is separating so that the full width can be uh in the Garner amen the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age so you see louia is the last age but then because we're Eternal amen praise the Lord so we are we are in the bride age amen the corn of wheat the bride wheat in order to understand sorry the wealth of of meaning involved in behold I have set before you an open door and no can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age Barberry already explained that that it's not a direct cut that after Philadelphia it will be loud there will be overlapping and same for the bride age right so before going to Bright AG there will be a a transition amen it's not a direct cut but then the thing is spiritually we are in the bright AIDS because God Spirit holy spirit is in us that's why it's very important to know that our election is sure amen we have to make our calling and election sure amen the seventh age a very short age gathers up into himself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of Pentecost Hallelujah once the Philadelphian age has about run its course the ludian AIDS quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to harvest first bind the tears to burn to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn that's Matthew 13:30 amen you see here so that we know uh uh it's just a reminder for us always right in in in paragraph 64 Fe of the trumpets now if I come with the message of Pentecost I would be in the Lan Church age and it wouldn't be right so you see when when we're trying to study we should not isolate although they they need to Dove tail with what uh what the message of the hour is because he he progressed his Revelation progressed but we cannot go the bride beyond the revelation of the Prophet because we are under him amen the message that we preach the gospel that will be preached the five-fold ministry will be under the umbrella of this message of the hour we cannot put Beyond it amen and and people are saying some some who who went out or they were longtime Believers of the message they saying we don't need the message anymore because the full word is already revealed how did that word got revealed to you amen if you are honest in ourselves we didn't even know anything amen right we might know the Bible but then to dve tail scripture to scripture you need a prophet reading between the lines you need the prophet it's it's very important for us to understand that we need a prophet amen so that we understand he's not God but the word of God comes through him and for us being the bride we are not God but the word of God comes through us and then we yes sir we say it we we preach it we teach it amen you see that's the reason that West could not take Luther's message Luther was in one age Church age and Wesley was his was in another age if Jesus would come in with the message of Moses it would not have worked if Moses would have come with the message of Noah it would not have worked so you see important why it's called message of the hour what hour this hour yes sir amen it's so important for us to know because uh what's the evidence that we have the Holy Ghost we have the ability to receive the word for our day we know all this amen brothers and I'm just reminding you brothers and sisters because uh so to to show that we are really in the bright a brother Branham said there are six places in the b in the message if you if you will search it but I will only read two the word that fell on the day of Pentecost so you see that's Lan Church AIDS the message there of for laia is Pentecost but actually the bride AIDS is more than that it's beyond that the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day that's no sir that was for Pentecost yes sir this is for the bride amen going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we are in the bride age amen no more than the word of law would work in the days of Moses right no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that amen oh Brothers again another one which is good too we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in the Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture amen that's the age that we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth you see we are in the Rapture age right now brothers and sisters the second if if I will just do this quickly you can see the bride AIDS here is the second coming of the lord it's a it's a timeline when the seals were open 1963 until the Rapture the only thing that we don't know is when he will come exactly when we will meet him in in the air but we know we already came he appeared right so you can see here the shout the voice and the trumpet the trumpet is the meeting in the air and we don't know when exactly is that because no one knows even the scripture is saying but we know it will come amen right so you can see here I will not tackle this because this is a a sermon by itself so you can see so it's a process brothers and sisters you can see you can see you can see it's a process it's it's good for our living it's life amen amen if if this message of the hour will not produce life in you then something's wrong because the thing is we we are bound to you know we're human beings we need to work we need to live uh we we we we are created uh so that we can live amen and we live by dead sub substance and uh uh we need to work so that we can leave it's not the other way around we don't leave to work so it means uh we we were checking what will we we will do when we retire because uh most of my colleagues who retired they're kind of a little a little bit uh older but then they come back and then my first question is why did you come back I have nothing to do what but for us it's different right we have something to do because the thing is uh uh I've been in fellowship with with some of the brothers and uh about about the the programs in the church because uh the brother in the Philippines was a missionary and established around 200 churches his life he's a missionary at the same time pastor and his message is uh uh missions for him is not just a program in the church he said it's the purpose of its existence because the thing is when I thought of it even Jesus Christ didn't have his own church because he's the church he's the one going he he built or I mean established church in Antioch in in in Ephesus wherever he he went right but then the thing is churches were established where he will go but for us we we are product of of something that uh uh you know uh this church as I can see is a is a product of someone that has the burden right to to have a church and it's it just evolved and and it's so good that but then the thing is what what I'm trying to say here is it's uh missions is are important missions are very important because they establish churches and missions means apostleship right that's why bra Bram is saying you might be the three of the people there you might be a prayer Warrior you might be a financial supporter or you must be a minister who goes to Mission so either way you will be used if if you cannot go send someone but it doesn't mean you have to go overseas or wherever because our our mission field is our home it start starts with our home I'm always guilty in that because the thing is we're we're busy in in this daily in our daily lives and we work we have to feed our families but we have to think of the focus as well we need to balance as well that we need to Fe our families too right we cannot just go and forget about our families because uh that's not how it is designed amen amen but uh yeah going back to that they they come without they're saying they have nothing to do but for us if we will retire we know we have a lot of things to do for the Lord amen and we can surrender ourselves amen five minutes so about this Romans 10:17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God but in Ezekiel it's the one Speaking that has the faith the the one that operates is the faith of the one speaking it's not the bones because they didn't have any ears right but then the thing is that faith of that Prophet was operated because he heard from the Lord amen the faith of God was in Ezekiel that's why he was able to prophesy and do it and and and it came to pass same for us when we hear the the faith of God when we hear it cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God when we read the when we read the Bible when when we feed when we pray we hear right the faith will come by hearing hearing by the word of God do you hear it do you understand it that's that's what it meant amen and it's very good to know that it's the faith of God in us that will operate it amen through the prophet of this age amen so important he that receiveth Matthew 10:41 so you see it's not only what brother Branham say it's also the word says amen he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man are you Righteous Brothers and sister we are Justified amen we are made righteous because he owns US fully amen he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward what is the reward of a righteous man eternal life amen and if if if they will hear us and they will receive us they will have eternal life that's right even they will not be bride but they can be a amen they can have eternal life the cup of cold water Matthew 24 important that's why we must not provoke other people to blaspheme us or blaspheme the Holy Ghost in US amen it's so important be careful that if they don't understand they might not be redeemable but then if they give you a cup of cold water they can be Eternal they might not be in the city they might not be bride right am but they can be in eternity with us amen amen so important important though brothers and sisters oh that's good we are on time I have three more slides I think so God through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is amen there are two seeds right exactly right we are wheat and tears but I mean there are two seeds wheat and tears but we are the wheat amen and uh how did we become Wheat by his four knowledge he knew that we will accept the message of the hour that's why we be he he predestinated us amen it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone that's so important brothers and sisters oh that seed is so is it's very important to know what kind of seed we have right and and and by their fruits you shall know them amen and and and and actually uh I I just saw a a good uh reading here there because uh there are two types of Salvation that uh that's being said by by others the wrong non-biblical way is uh they're saying Faith plus Works equals salvation ation so those are Faith oh th those are Works based salvation you cannot you cannot work your salvation right uh by by doing good works but the right biblical way is salvation is equal to Faith plus Works our faith when we are saved it will produce the fruits fruits of the holy spirit amen that's that's the proper way to to check uh how Faith Works because for by grace Ephesians 28:9 we are saved through faith not by works less anount should boast because when we think that oh we're doing good oh we give all these things uh we we we we tight uh Faithfully yes that's good and and and and that will uh that that will benefit us I I I I just uh I just remember one thing here about paying tights and paying our offerings so basically if we do good things it is it is said you pay your tis it's not you give your tis I don't know why I went there I just remember that paying means you owe you owe it giving means you're freely giving it but uh you pay your tithes because it everything belongs to God even our time right so it means wow wow that's that's a good thing because that word will make a difference because we think oh I'm I'm giving all my tights no you're not giving you're paying because because you owe the Lord everything Belongs to the Lord and he's just giving 10% we cannot even uh Escape taxes right imposed by the government how about the Lords right but then the thing is I I I was just surmising here and and and thinking or not even presuming because it's in the word what you do today right because um uh Abraham paid tis to melkisedek I know it has been preached before then it was accounted for Levi but Abraham is not oh Levi is not Abraham's son it's even to the Next Generation what you're doing today and sorry I'm a Treasurer so I I was just I was just thinking oh those people I will not name names but if if he's okay I I would tell I would want to thank brother Paul for example what once I'm seeing he had that desire to have this church established he wanted baren to be a full-time Pastor sorry BR bar Paul I just I just thought I will tell this but look at the inheritance all the children grandchildren because he's so he's so honest faithful in it I just want to make it as an example just to give BR Paul and his family a bouquet of flower I I was just so amazed that uh a man can can have that desire so that this church will be built and you can see we are growing God is God is good I mean what I'm saying here is if you do something good today it might you might not be the one who will reap the consequences it could be your children and your grandchildren Grand grandchildren if the Lord ties am there's a good cause in it brothers and sisters amen oh it's just so important but then it's the same thing when you do evil things your descendants could also reap those consequences oh brothers and sisters sinning it's your choice it's our choice if we sin but the consequences is not our choice amen so we better choose the right thing brothers and sisters it's so important sorry bar Paul but uh I hope you are also blessed in it that giving is not giving tis it's paying TI it belongs to him anything beyond 10% can be an offering but you can you can give what you what everything uh all all all of what you have if if the denominations are are tapping on that principle of Malachi 3:10 give give give give they're all give give give right but they are being blessed because it's a principle it's a principle in the Bible right although they might not have the word the full word but they are reaping the consequence of what they they're tapping on right because it's the word of God the word of God will we will will not come void amen It's always important amen oh I don't know why I went there but then the thing is it's so good to encourage you brothers and sisters that uh amen when you pay your tis amen when you give your offerings amen there's a good uh consequence that will come out of it amen and it's it doesn't belong to us even that's why we pay that's right amen if we don't pay our our mortgage they will your house will be foreclosed and we cannot even uh do anything about it because the it's the law they will enforce because it's theirs from the beginning right so it's the same if if you cannot give your 10% then God will take it somehow in a different form so I'm just encouraging you it's it's a good way to uh to practice our faith amen and it's the law apply it brothers and sisters amen I don't know why I went there but uh I think uh that's good so you see here even Revelations 108-111 and he said unto me this is John he was asked to to take the open book we're feeding from an open book brothers and sisters amen because if it's still closed then who will open it right but yeah it's an open book it's not just revealed before but now it's revealed through the message of the hour amen and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings this is the bride ministry right now is to prophesy again amen amen so it's a we we must know who we are we are the bride so we must prophesy again prophesy again means we will make dead bones very dry bones live we can make all problem go away we can make sickness go away amen everything that is inanimate it's us speaking that's why we are being restored by the spoken word through the prophet of this hour amen amen now this is the last slide and then I'll I'll wrap up I'll call the musicians now he's called the church he has called the Church through what through justification called it through sanctification and then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire am and he took it what what did he take this it is the church through a process so you see it's always a process so don't don't worry if you're not yet perfect because you're in a process but once you're in a process you will mature you will grow Amen to the image and likeness of God Amen amen he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart amen now it has it we're talking about the church Capital C here which is the bride the bride has to go through that before he can move into it hallelujah amen before he meaning the Holy Ghost himself can move into us so that's why our our life should be in order so that he can move into US am it's very important to put things in order even the Small Things brothers and sisters amen are very important right so you can see here we have some examples of the Bible God called Jacob but he's a deceiver that's right Rahab was a harlot but he but God called her David was an adulterer but he called him so you see mvin is a sinner but God called me amen it's the same you can put it in your name because we are all sinners but you can see here God did not call the qualified amen we were not qualified but he qualified the called amen because we are called according to his purpose and we have a purpose brothers and sisters we are so thankful that he had this uh in his mind his election before the foundation of the world we know we know we will be with him in eternity you can see the seventh and the eth is so important Romans 7 and Romans 8 because there's now therefore no condemnation Amen to them who are in Christ Jesus so you see we are all sinners don't worry that's already given right because that's the purpose of his coming to save us he didn't call for the righteous he didn't come for the righteous he came for us the Sinners and we're so thankful that we can submit ourselves to his word amen amen oh we are being restored brothers and sisters yes we are how by the spoken word amen through the prophet of this age brothers and sisters is important heed is call heed is me message he he his command amen it will not do you wrong it will better us off amen oh I hope your I didn't take much of your time I hope and uh I hope it's uh it encouraged you the original life sister if we can because this original life is so important even the verse of them by the spoken word amen amen God's attributes were manifested to this bride of last days we have brought the Revelation by the God's prophets message and we know who we are and wonder us for praise the Lord the original life the original life the original SE the original word is what I believe the son of man is Reed the seven SE is unveiled theive the original SE we are the word made flesh today is what the say and our names are s within with but perfect without our s yes we are anointed and and inspired by our God Amen original the origal SE the original word is what I believe the son of man is revealed the seven seal is a the original life the original sea our right of understanding he has openen up at last and With Victory ours who were came down in the past trly as sounded and we have responded to our god the original life the original life the original s the original World what I believe the is the seven SE is UN bu the original Life The Original Seed last verse we are called unto adoption full Authority and power sleeping Saints will wake and join us for translation in this hour Gentiles days will soon be over Glory Hallelujah to our god the original life the origal life the original SE the original word is what I believe the son of man is revealed the seven s is unveil the original life the original SE amen I just uh remembered something here because uh we are in Easter we have the resurrection at that day you shall know the Oneness of Christ in us I just thought uh I just put this as a as a little object illustration it was done before I think eight years ago by Brother David Nash but I will do it a little bit different so if you think God is in us how would we show it if you think God God is a fountain of spirit so he doesn't have a vessel so what he did is God poured himself into Christ right so think of this as the whole Fountain of spirit but you cannot you you need a container for for water so think of it that it will be poured into Christ and this is Christ and all the that Christ was he poured into his church individual so I'm one of them so I will take the spirit of him in me so where's God now where's the spirit of God now it's in me and it's in you he poured in the day of Pentecost to many 120 people and then it went it progressed until now we're in 2024 you can see the time is at hand amen we are here brothers and sisters and remember that Spirit the holy spirit of God is in you right now the bride coming of Christ am amen I hope everything is uh it's a blessing amen amen uh let's just bow in prayer and then I'll ask BR bar to come oh Lord Jesus we're so thankful unto you Lord for your word Lord that is living in US Lord we know we are in the process of being perfected of maturing oh Lord the only thing we can do as a start Lord is to die to ourselves Lord so that you can live in us oh God and we and when we surrender ourselves Lord we will be entitled to your token Lord token of Life the blood the life in that blood Lord Jesus is important and it's living in us oh Lord Jesus you have to go Lord we know so that your Holy Spirit can dwell in us and as we are filled Lord fill our cups Lord every time oh Lord Jesus as we feed on your word you're feeling us every day daily oh Lord Jesus help us Lord that uh we we will continue Lord uh thinking of the Eternal rather than the the the physical oh Lord the natural the all this natural will pass away oh Lord but your word will never pass away oh Lord Jesus that uh oh Lord we are Eternal as Eternal we can be oh Lord because you you elected us destinated us before the foundation of the world oh Lord may may we be different people Lord when we come out of this uh Church oh Lord Jesus to to recharge us Lord for for the week for the week coming Lord we know we we have to work Lord so that we can earn something to feed our families oh Lord we know and and that's a curse that uh uh that's given Lord but uh we know Lord we have something that is uh uh of value the pearl of great price Lord the message of the hour which is the full word manifesting in US Lord we want to thank you Lord may you bless your people now Lord as we go our separate ways and I ask all these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] me enjoy that today it's just nothing but the truth you know the spirit the prophet and the bride are all going to say the same thing amen he said it very clearly today and if they're saying something different there's something wrong either it's the wrong word coming to them or it's the wrong seat in them right but the beautiful thing is I love this I love this I love this alls we have to do our responsibility is just to reflect the word just to preach the word to speak the truth because that truth that word it will make every single seed come to life whether it wants to or not and it will bear fruit of the life that's inside of it whether it wants to or not and it's just the way it is it's just a beautiful thing and if we have the fruit of the spirit in our lives we've got every single reason to rejoice and my prayer for each and every one of us today moving forward is that we would be able to recognize the fruit of the spirit in our own lives Jesus Christ himself not some inanimate object not some dead bones that that have creeds and dogmas and traditions and ways but the literal life of Jesus Christ Living out through each and every one of us so many points that I got out of it I just think you know the word of God it comes through the prophets so well laid out sometimes I wish I could actually explain things the way I see it explained just a beautiful uh teaching today about that the word only comes the word of God only comes to the prophet only comes to the prophet and and that word that comes to the prophet is the same word that we believe and that word alone is what will change our bodies yes sir and we've said it before I'll keep saying it brothers and sisters the body changes now we're changing these bodies now we want to see the old twin die out we heard that last week so that the new one can live my once we get everything in proper order everything will happen the way it's supposed to am not one second late and not one second to too soon it's just a marvelous thing we serve a mighty God today can we just sing blessed be the name
