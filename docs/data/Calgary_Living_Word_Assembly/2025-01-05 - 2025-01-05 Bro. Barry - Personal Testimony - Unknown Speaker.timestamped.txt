[41:04] love through the
[41:08] storm. He
[41:09] is
[41:11] Lord, Lord of all.
[41:17] [Music]
[41:39] Woo! Amen. God bless you, brother Faren.
[41:41] So appreciate that special this morning.
[41:44] Resonated with all of us. I know that.
[41:46] God bless you. Stand with me if you
[41:47] would as we change the order of the
[41:48] service this
[41:50] morning. We fall down. We lay our crowns
[41:53] as we call our
[41:56] pastor. Trusting in the in no man but
[42:00] trusting in the office of thinking about
[42:03] Ephesians 4. It's just amazing how God
[42:05] would use fallible men to bring his word
[42:08] for the perfecting of the saints. It's
[42:10] an amazing paradox. But we believe the
[42:12] word of God and we came this morning
[42:14] expecting to be changed through the
[42:17] office of a pastor once again. Oh, we
[42:21] fall
[42:22] down. We lay our
[42:26] crowns at the
[42:30] feet of Jesus.
[42:34] Oh, the greatness
[42:38] of his mercy and
[42:41] love at the
[42:45] feet of
[42:47] Jesus. And we cry holy,
[42:53] holy,
[42:55] holy. And we
[42:57] cry holy,
[43:01] holy, holy.
[43:04] And we
[43:05] cry, holy,
[43:09] holy,
[43:11] holy
[43:12] is the lamb coming from redeemed lips
[43:15] this morning. The first verse. Oh, we
[43:19] fall
[43:20] down. We lay our
[43:24] crowns at the
[43:27] feet of Jesus.
[43:32] Oh, the greatness
[43:35] of his mercy and
[43:39] love at the
[43:42] feet of
[43:45] Jesus. And we cry holy,
[43:51] holy,
[43:52] holy. And we
[43:55] cry holy,
[43:58] holy, holy.
[44:01] And we cry
[44:04] holy,
[44:06] holy,
[44:08] holy. Is the lamb crying holy. Oh, and
[44:14] we cry holy,
[44:18] holy,
[44:20] holy. And we
[44:32] Holy,
[44:34] holy,
[44:36] holy is the
[44:40] lamb.
[44:43] Hallelujah. God bless you today. Is it
[44:46] turned on? Welcome to the house of the
[44:48] Lord. If you have a need this morning,
[44:51] just make it known unto him by way of an
[44:53] uplift hand. We have a request from
[44:56] Sister
[44:57] Emily. Says, "Please keep me in your
[44:59] prayer. I had a gall stone measuring 6
[45:02] mm found in my recent
[45:07] ultrasound." That was in November in 24.
[45:09] I know God is more than able
[45:14] to get this stone to disappear. Yes,
[45:18] and you know, if you heard Sister
[45:19] Emily's testimony on New Year's Eve, you
[45:23] would say, "If anybody knows that God is
[45:25] able,
[45:27] let's just go to him in
[45:29] prayer." Our gracious heavenly father,
[45:32] Lord Jesus, thank you for this morning,
[45:35] Lord. Thank you for this opportunity,
[45:38] Lord Jesus, one more time where we could
[45:40] gather together and bring our voices,
[45:42] Lord. the
[45:44] the Lord, the ability that we have been
[45:48] given in in this side of eternity,
[45:52] Father, to worship you, Lord Jesus. What
[45:55] an honor and a privilege it is, Lord, to
[45:58] sing holy, holy, holy is the lamb.
[46:04] Lord Jesus, when we've recognized what
[46:06] you've done for us, it's just so easy to
[46:08] worship you, Lord. Father, we love you
[46:11] and we thank you for your tender
[46:13] mercies, Lord, your goodness, your your
[46:16] many manifold promises in your word. And
[46:20] Lord Jesus, this morning, we just we
[46:22] come as needy children, Father,
[46:26] you've created us this way. And Lord, we
[46:28] accept the way that you've created us,
[46:31] and we thank you for it, Lord. And we
[46:34] know that we are in a transitional state
[46:36] right now where this world is falling
[46:39] apart. Oh Lord Jesus, but your body is
[46:42] not falling apart. Your body is growing
[46:45] fitly joint together, Lord Jesus.
[46:49] Word cell upon word cell. And Father,
[46:52] this morning we're just so thankful that
[46:54] we can bring our needs to you. And we
[46:57] just want to thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[46:59] this request from Sister Emily. Lord,
[47:01] that it's another opportunity for you to
[47:04] come by her way and express yourself to
[47:06] her and through her, Lord. Amen. And not
[47:09] just to her and through her, but Lord,
[47:12] through your body. We know that your
[47:14] prophet said that healing comes through
[47:16] the body. And Father, we accept your
[47:19] provision.
[47:21] So Lord, we just thank you for touching
[47:24] Sister Emily. Lord, one more time.
[47:27] Lord, give her strength. Give her faith.
[47:29] Lord, take away pain. Oh, Father, give
[47:31] her courage. Yes, Lord.
[47:34] Father, we just want to commit her into
[47:36] your hands now for your glory. And Lord,
[47:39] we want to remember each and every hand
[47:41] that was made known unto you today.
[47:43] Lord, each person that decided to defy
[47:46] gravity and to bring their need to you
[47:50] personally, we just thank you for
[47:52] meeting that need, Lord. And for each
[47:54] one, Lord, that maybe didn't raise a
[47:57] hand, that maybe didn't acknowledge a
[47:59] need. Father, we know that we all have
[48:01] needs. Father, I do as well. And we just
[48:05] commit them all into your hands. Amen.
[48:07] And we will be careful to give you the
[48:09] thanks. Amen. Lord Jesus, this morning
[48:11] as we go forwards, Father, help us to
[48:14] get out of the way. Yes. Of the speaker
[48:17] and the hearer to become one. Father,
[48:19] let every single word that's uttered
[48:21] today be for your glory, Lord.
[48:28] [Music]
[48:30] I'm sure we're all thankful, Lord, for
[48:33] Yes, Lord. What you've done for each and
[48:35] every one of us. Amen.
[48:38] And Lord Jesus, if there's anybody here
[48:40] today, young or old, that doesn't know
[48:42] you the way that we're going to talk
[48:45] about you
[48:48] today. Father, I pray that you would
[48:51] grant to them
[48:53] that measure of grace. Amen. That they
[48:56] would be able to acknowledge it, Lord.
[48:59] Because we know that you've granted each
[49:00] and every one that level of grace. But
[49:03] only few, oh father, few are able to
[49:06] recognize it. Lord, many are called, but
[49:09] very few are chosen. Father, we just
[49:11] pray that you would be glorified.
[49:14] We love you and we thank you. We just
[49:16] commit this service into your hands now
[49:18] for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name
[49:21] we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:26] Hallelujah. Thank you, musicians.
[49:30] If you have your Bibles
[49:32] today or just have two scriptures I
[49:35] would like to
[49:37] read, Romans chapter
[49:44] 12, Romans chapter
[49:47] 12 and then 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[50:06] Romans chapter
[50:09] 12. So beautiful. Verse one.
[50:17] My says, "I beseech you, brethren,
[50:20] beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[50:23] mercies of God, that you present your
[50:25] bodies a living
[50:28] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[50:32] which is your reasonable
[50:35] service, and be not
[50:37] conformed to this
[50:40] world, but be ye
[50:42] transformed by the renewing ing of your
[50:45] mind that ye may prove what is that good
[50:51] and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[50:55] For I say through the grace given unto
[50:57] me, that every man that is among you,
[51:01] not to think of himself more highly than
[51:05] he ought to
[51:06] think, but to think
[51:10] soberly, according as God hath dealt to
[51:13] every man the measure of
[51:16] faith. For as we have many members in
[51:19] one body, and all members have not the
[51:22] same office, so we being many are one
[51:27] body in Christ, and every one members
[51:32] one of another.
[51:35] Let's turn over to second
[51:38] Corinthians chapter 5.
[51:48] 2 Corinthians chapter
[51:53] 5 verse
[52:01] 17.
[52:03] Therefore, if any man be in
[52:06] Christ, he is a new
[52:09] creature. Isn't that wonderful?
[52:12] It doesn't say that he will be a new
[52:16] creature. It doesn't say that he was a
[52:21] new
[52:21] creature. It says that he is present
[52:25] tense a new creature.
[52:29] Old things are passed
[52:32] away. And behold, not some things, not
[52:35] most things, not many things, all things
[52:39] are become new. Amen. Let's just bow in
[52:42] prayer one more
[52:44] time. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful
[52:47] for your goodness. We're thankful for
[52:49] your word. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[52:53] a vindicated prophet. Amen. And Lord, I
[52:56] was just thinking as I was meditating
[52:58] today, how amazing it would have been
[53:02] for the people, how how many people in
[53:04] the days of the prophets actually
[53:07] recognized the prophet in the
[53:11] land. I'm sure it was very few people.
[53:14] It wasn't until many, many times, many
[53:18] seasons, many years after that people
[53:21] recognized the prophet. But father, you
[53:24] have given us the ability to recognize
[53:28] that there was a prophet for our day.
[53:31] Father, we pray that we could just
[53:32] consecrate ourselves fresh unto you once
[53:35] again. Yes, Lord. Lord, that we could
[53:36] bind ourselves together in one mind and
[53:39] one accord. That you would be the
[53:41] central theme of the words that are
[53:43] spoken today. And Lord, that you would
[53:46] receive all of the praise and all of the
[53:48] honor and all of the glory. We love you
[53:52] and we thank you. We commit each life
[53:55] now and this service into your hands in
[53:57] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[54:01] God bless you this morning. You may be
[54:03] seated.
[54:07] My I
[54:10] uh I just wanted to mention a couple
[54:13] things here from our first scripture.
[54:17] Maybe before I even get into that, I
[54:19] just would like to thank everyone once
[54:21] again for the tremendous service we had
[54:24] on Tuesday night. It was absolutely
[54:28] exceptional. I'm sure that everyone
[54:30] probably left here feeling the same way.
[54:33] Some people maybe didn't. Maybe they
[54:35] felt that it was way too long. And but
[54:37] I'm sure that many people, if not
[54:39] everyone, left
[54:40] here not sure that we actually spent
[54:43] that much time here. I I couldn't
[54:45] believe it. I did the math and we were
[54:47] over 5 hours in service. It was just
[54:50] tremendous. Just an absolutely
[54:52] phenomenal meeting. And it was the Lord.
[54:55] It was truly his presence that made it
[54:57] that way. It wasn't anything that we
[54:59] did. Just tremendous to get together and
[55:01] fellowship around the things of the
[55:04] Lord. And uh I just would like to
[55:07] welcome our visitors. God bless you
[55:09] Classins. Good to have you here. And
[55:11] anybody else who might be visiting, I'm
[55:13] sorry if I've missed you. God richly
[55:15] bless you. Um, today I want to do
[55:18] something that I've talked about doing
[55:21] for a long time and I'm going to go
[55:23] forwards with it. I'm going to give my
[55:25] testimony today. Many people have heard
[55:28] it, but many people haven't. And uh, you
[55:32] know, God did something spectacular in
[55:35] my life and I don't feel like I I
[55:37] deserve it. I don't feel like I merited
[55:40] anything in my life to be here today to
[55:43] even be alive really. But it's God's
[55:47] choice. And to recognize that is just
[55:51] it's phenomenal. It's a paradox
[55:54] actually. You know, in the scripture
[55:55] that we read, uh, the first one out of
[55:58] Romans chapter 12, I beseech you
[56:01] therefore, brethren, that by the mercies
[56:04] of God, that ye present your bodies a
[56:07] living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
[56:09] God, which is a reasonable service. I
[56:12] just think it's so beautiful how the
[56:14] word it it gives us direction. And it
[56:17] gives us leadership and and it tells us
[56:19] very plainly that we ought to be looking
[56:22] after this temple, this temple, our
[56:25] bodies, that we present our bodies as a
[56:29] living sacrifice. A and you know, it's
[56:32] interesting because we can look at
[56:34] sacrifices. I've just been going through
[56:36] the Old Testament and and just taking my
[56:38] time and studying through it. And if you
[56:41] look at the different types of
[56:42] sacrifices, every single animal
[56:45] sacrifice is a dead
[56:48] sacrifice. It's death.
[56:50] But here we have the word of God saying
[56:52] to present our bodies as a living
[56:55] sacrifice.
[56:58] Not just as a dead one, a living
[57:01] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[57:05] which is your reasonable service. And I
[57:07] I just think I can't help but think, you
[57:10] know, um just remember a as I preach, I
[57:14] preach to myself. I'm not preaching
[57:16] about anybody except for this guy. I
[57:19] need to present myself as a living
[57:21] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.
[57:25] You know what? It's not the big things
[57:27] that spoil the vine, is it? What is it?
[57:31] It's the little foxes that spoil the
[57:33] vine. It's those little time wasters
[57:35] that spoil the vine. It's those little
[57:37] tiny things that we do that we know the
[57:39] Holy Spirit's not pleased about, but we
[57:42] still do them. Preaching to myself here.
[57:45] I know it. But isn't it wonderful that
[57:48] we have a God who is rich in mercy?
[57:50] Amen. And he won't just destroy us. He
[57:54] won't just make us a bug on a
[57:55] windshield. That's the devil that wants
[57:58] to do that. And when we start to feel
[58:00] like that's what's happening, that's the
[58:02] devil. Put him in his place. We serve a
[58:06] God who is rich in mercy. He's not
[58:08] looking to destroy us. But he does have
[58:11] a way. He does have a truth and he is
[58:15] the life and his way is his word. That's
[58:17] his will. We went over that a little
[58:19] while ago. But I beseech you therefore,
[58:21] brethren, but by the mercies of God,
[58:22] that you present your bodies a living
[58:24] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[58:26] which is your reasonable service, and be
[58:28] not conformed to this world. Don't be
[58:30] looking to be like this world. Don't be
[58:32] trying to implement the things that are
[58:35] going on in this world in your life.
[58:38] Because when you're doing that, you're
[58:40] contrary to the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[58:43] Don't be conformed to this world, but be
[58:45] ye transformed
[58:48] by the renewing of your mind. Amen. I
[58:51] think that's so beautiful.
[58:53] That you may prove what is that good,
[58:56] acceptable, and perfect will of God. And
[58:58] you know, I I just a couple of words
[59:00] jumped out of that scripture for me.
[59:02] Conformed. We don't want to be
[59:04] conforming to this world. It's it's it's
[59:09] G4964 to fashion alike. And and you
[59:13] know, I I can't help but think, you
[59:15] know, how easy is it for us to fashion
[59:19] alike? Isn't fashion a big deal today?
[59:24] Sometimes you can't even tell the
[59:25] difference between a believer and an
[59:26] unbeliever because of the fashion.
[59:29] We need to be careful where we stand.
[59:33] There needs to be a differentiating
[59:35] factor and and the word of God we read
[59:36] it it gives us the direction but to
[59:38] fashion alike conformed i.e. conform to
[59:42] the same
[59:43] pattern. And you know, brothers and
[59:46] sisters, I got to say it. I I have to
[59:48] say it. I can't not say
[59:51] it. I'm guilty of it. As Christian
[59:56] believers, is it becoming of us to be
[1:00:00] presenting our body as a living
[1:00:02] sacrifice when we talk like the
[1:00:05] gangster? Yo.
[1:00:08] And we've got the abbreviations all
[1:00:11] down. Dog,
[1:00:15] right? Is that becoming of a Christian?
[1:00:18] When we're out in a restaurant in the
[1:00:20] world and people hear us talking like
[1:00:23] that, does that encourage them to
[1:00:25] Christ? Or does that actually show that
[1:00:28] we're what are we doing? We're
[1:00:29] conforming to the world.
[1:00:32] Amen. That's no place for a believer,
[1:00:35] brothers and sisters, to be talking that
[1:00:37] way.
[1:00:40] Gangsters are not Christians.
[1:00:43] That is not something that we want to
[1:00:45] do. If you have a gangster spirit, look
[1:00:48] out.
[1:00:49] Brother Brandham said, "When I've got
[1:00:51] the Holy Spirit, I behave like Christ."
[1:00:55] Oh my. But if I had the spirit of
[1:00:57] Beethoven, what would I do?
[1:01:00] I would compose music. It would be
[1:01:03] beautiful. Amen. And if I had the spirit
[1:01:06] of John Dillinger, I would be a
[1:01:09] gangster.
[1:01:10] And a gangster is someone that murders,
[1:01:13] someone that steals.
[1:01:16] On and on and on. That's not something
[1:01:17] we want to do.
[1:01:20] We don't want to conform with this
[1:01:22] world, brothers and sisters. We should
[1:01:23] be totally different than this world.
[1:01:25] Amen. And I want to say it, when we hear
[1:01:27] young people in the message talking like
[1:01:29] the world, there's something wrong. And
[1:01:32] it's time to get back to Christ. And
[1:01:34] parents, when you hear your children
[1:01:36] talking that way, drop the hammer. Amen.
[1:01:39] You're the ones in control, not the
[1:01:41] children.
[1:01:43] The children don't they're not the tail
[1:01:45] that wags the dog. The parents are the
[1:01:48] ones who are the Holy Ghost for the
[1:01:50] children. Amen. It's very important to
[1:01:53] remember you are your brother's keeper.
[1:01:56] Amen. The elder
[1:01:58] brothers, let's encourage the younger
[1:02:00] brothers. Amen. Let's be positive
[1:02:03] influences one on another. Not not
[1:02:06] sounding like gangster rappers.
[1:02:09] That's not cool. If you're a believer,
[1:02:12] in fact, I would say that you're
[1:02:13] actually sending the wrong message.
[1:02:17] We don't want to be conformed fashioned
[1:02:19] alike this world. We don't want to
[1:02:21] conform to the same pattern. We don't
[1:02:24] want to speak the same. We don't want to
[1:02:25] look the same. We don't want to act the
[1:02:27] same.
[1:02:28] We don't want to conform to. We don't
[1:02:30] want to fashion ourselves according to
[1:02:32] this world. That is
[1:02:35] G4964. We are supposed to be
[1:02:37] transformed.
[1:02:40] Transformed. That is
[1:02:42] G3339. to transform literally or
[1:02:45] figuratively.
[1:02:48] Metamorphos is what the word is. Isn't
[1:02:51] that beautiful? Amen. Metamorphos.
[1:02:55] And we all know what that word means. It
[1:02:56] means there's supposed to be something
[1:02:57] that happens. We change. And didn't we
[1:02:59] read that scripture that we become a new
[1:03:01] creature? We don't remain the same. All
[1:03:04] of the old things in our life, what
[1:03:06] happens? Behold, they pass away. Amen.
[1:03:10] And behold, how many things become new?
[1:03:14] All things. All things become new.
[1:03:17] That's right. We're supposed to
[1:03:20] transform.
[1:03:21] Be
[1:03:22] transformed by the renewing of our
[1:03:25] minds. Amen. And I'll tell you the
[1:03:28] formula for that, brothers and sisters.
[1:03:29] It's real simple. Just repent for the
[1:03:31] remission of your sins. Get baptized in
[1:03:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:03:34] the remission of your sins. And what?
[1:03:35] You'll receive the Holy Ghost. When that
[1:03:37] happens, you will begin the process of
[1:03:41] renovating. Amen.
[1:03:43] And that is the renewing. Renewing is
[1:03:47] G349.
[1:03:49] Renovating. Renewing. This is out of the
[1:03:52] the concordance, the the the Hebrew
[1:03:55] concordance or the Greek concordance. I
[1:03:58] think it's beautiful though. We we are
[1:04:00] not supposed to be conformed. We're
[1:04:01] supposed to be transformed by the
[1:04:03] renewing of our minds. The only way
[1:04:06] that's going to happen is to be fully
[1:04:08] surrendered. Not partially, not mostly,
[1:04:11] not sometimes, not kind
[1:04:13] of. Except for when I'm whatever. Throw
[1:04:16] in the adjective. Except for when
[1:04:19] whoever. Throw in the people. No, no,
[1:04:21] no. We're supposed to be the same people
[1:04:23] at work as we are here right now in this
[1:04:25] moment. Right now, we're the same people
[1:04:27] at work. Amen. When we are at school, we
[1:04:31] are the exact same people we're here
[1:04:33] right now. Amen.
[1:04:36] Thinking that we can just be a different
[1:04:37] person when we get home as a husband
[1:04:41] than I am right here, right now. You
[1:04:43] know what? You're only fooling yourself.
[1:04:46] You're not fooling anyone.
[1:04:49] We need to be the same. The same. The
[1:04:52] same. When we've been fully renovated,
[1:04:54] brothers and sisters, we are the same.
[1:04:56] We're not We're not actually different
[1:04:58] people. We don't have different
[1:05:00] personalities.
[1:05:02] And and you know, I'm I'm going on like
[1:05:04] this, I guess, just because I think it's
[1:05:06] really important for us to recognize
[1:05:07] there is a transforming power in this
[1:05:10] world. It doesn't matter how many false
[1:05:12] witnesses there are. It doesn't matter
[1:05:14] how much confusion there is. It doesn't
[1:05:16] matter whatever we've gone through in
[1:05:18] this world. I am a living witness to
[1:05:20] tell you there is a transforming power
[1:05:22] in this world, brothers and sisters.
[1:05:26] So, here we go. I I was born July the
[1:05:29] 18th in
[1:05:30] 1972 in Claire's home,
[1:05:33] Alberta. I was one of four children born
[1:05:36] to Allan and Sharon
[1:05:38] Johnson. We lived on a farm east of
[1:05:41] Claire's home. And that's actually where
[1:05:43] my dad lives right now. Some of the
[1:05:44] people, a couple of the brothers might
[1:05:46] have been there with me at one point
[1:05:48] when we were going to Lethbridge and we
[1:05:50] stopped in there and met my dad. That's
[1:05:53] where I live for the first year of my
[1:05:54] life and that's where my dad currently
[1:05:57] lives and uh it's just just a wonderful
[1:06:00] place. Clarisome has a real special
[1:06:01] place in my heart. I I was one of four
[1:06:04] children born to Al and Sharon Johnson
[1:06:07] and uh you know just after they were uh
[1:06:11] after I was born actually uh I was about
[1:06:14] a year old my mom and my dad they
[1:06:16] divorced. they had a a real hard time.
[1:06:19] And my dad, he packed the family up and
[1:06:22] we moved to Calgary in 1974, I think it
[1:06:25] was. And uh so maybe I was just over a
[1:06:28] year. And so we uh started our our life
[1:06:32] in Calgary. And uh at that point, my dad
[1:06:35] remarried a woman named Carolyn. She was
[1:06:38] Carolyn Goodbrand. She became Carolyn
[1:06:41] Johnson. And this was the woman who
[1:06:43] raised me. She was my stepmother. And uh
[1:06:46] she was diagnosed with multiple
[1:06:49] sclerosis I think before even uh she got
[1:06:53] married with my dad. But you know
[1:06:55] because of that our family life was
[1:06:57] pretty much hinged upon her health. And
[1:07:00] so we had a lot of uh ups and downs and
[1:07:04] ins and outs in the home. If anybody
[1:07:06] understands the disease muscular or uh
[1:07:09] multiple sclerosis then uh you'll
[1:07:11] understand what I'm talking about.
[1:07:14] My stepmother Carolyn, she had it. And
[1:07:16] uh you know what it's like in the home
[1:07:19] when mama gets sick, when she has a
[1:07:21] cold, when she has allergies, when
[1:07:25] mama's just not happy. We know what
[1:07:27] that's like. This was next level, I
[1:07:30] would say, for a mother with four
[1:07:32] children to get that level of a disease
[1:07:36] impacting your life. It changes
[1:07:37] everything. And uh so we grew up with
[1:07:41] her and uh we understood that when mama
[1:07:44] was sick it was, you know, time to pitch
[1:07:46] in and help out and and maybe just give
[1:07:49] her a little bit of a wide birth and and
[1:07:51] not really be too much of a problem. And
[1:07:53] fortunately, she had many remissions and
[1:07:56] uh she also had terrible attacks from
[1:07:58] the disease. And you know, she uh did
[1:08:02] the best she could, I think, with what
[1:08:04] she had. She passed away. I I was
[1:08:07] thinking about it. I think it was either
[1:08:09] 2007 or 2008 in Red Deer, Alberta. And
[1:08:13] uh you know, through the course of my
[1:08:15] life, I became quite I think estranged
[1:08:18] is the word. Um after my dad divorced
[1:08:22] her, they had a divorce when I was
[1:08:24] probably about 14 years
[1:08:26] old.
[1:08:28] Um yeah, I didn't spend very much time
[1:08:31] with her or talk to her until I actually
[1:08:33] wound up getting saved.
[1:08:36] But it's wonderful because um even
[1:08:38] though I had a bunch of anger and I had
[1:08:40] a bunch of confusion, I had a whole
[1:08:42] bunch of feelings, emotions, it's
[1:08:44] wonderful how the Lord actually
[1:08:46] transforms us. Amen. And he makes us a
[1:08:49] new creature because I was able to go
[1:08:51] there and see her with uh my wife after
[1:08:55] I was married and she was at the
[1:08:57] position where she couldn't even move.
[1:09:07] But
[1:09:08] I I just said to her, you
[1:09:12] know, I had a lot of problems in my life
[1:09:15] and I didn't know how to deal with some
[1:09:17] of the stuff
[1:09:20] and can I read the Bible to you? It was
[1:09:24] the one thing that I felt like would be
[1:09:25] real common ground. And and she just
[1:09:28] blinked her eyes and started to cry and
[1:09:31] nodded her head.
[1:09:33] And so I was able to just take take the
[1:09:36] time to read Romans chapter 8 with her.
[1:09:40] And uh you know that
[1:09:42] was the one time I saw her before she
[1:09:45] passed away. And I was so thankful that
[1:09:48] I was able to go and see her and just
[1:09:51] tell her that I'm sorry for my behavior.
[1:09:54] I can't be accountable for anyone else's
[1:09:57] behavior in this world, but I know what
[1:09:58] I can do for me and apologize for me and
[1:10:02] everything that I had done and the the
[1:10:04] mistreatment that I had for her. Because
[1:10:06] even though I had a biological mother, I
[1:10:08] didn't really know her well at that
[1:10:09] time. And I had the ability to say that
[1:10:13] there was someone that did take the time
[1:10:16] to raise
[1:10:17] me. And she did raise me. She raised me
[1:10:20] as good as she could. I remember one
[1:10:22] time distinctly where I I was not even
[1:10:25] in school yet and and this might sound
[1:10:27] really silly but it really impacted my
[1:10:29] life. Here I am at 52 years old talking
[1:10:31] about it. I was running down the road
[1:10:33] and I was just a kid. I don't know. It
[1:10:36] was before school and I think we're
[1:10:38] walking one of the older kids to school
[1:10:40] and I remember distinctly running down
[1:10:42] the road and just using my imagination
[1:10:45] and and there was cars and we needed to
[1:10:46] stop the cars so we could go across the
[1:10:48] road. And I remember running to the edge
[1:10:50] of the sidewalk and screaming out stop
[1:10:53] in the name of
[1:10:54] God and my stepmother correcting me
[1:10:57] sharply saying you don't use the word of
[1:10:59] God in vain.
[1:11:01] You don't do that. and and I thought,
[1:11:04] "Wow, it really stuck with me." And you
[1:11:07] know, she she did the best she could
[1:11:09] with what she had. But I recall spending
[1:11:11] time with her parents growing up in in
[1:11:14] Red Deer. And uh it's interesting now
[1:11:18] looking back because I remember hearing
[1:11:20] her parents talk about spiritual things.
[1:11:23] I remember them being uh I believe they
[1:11:25] were Baptists and they had a real strong
[1:11:28] Baptist faith. And uh I remember hearing
[1:11:31] her her her parents, my grandparents as
[1:11:34] I knew them, talking about the things of
[1:11:36] the Lord. And it was just sort of a
[1:11:37] normal thing for me. I had no idea about
[1:11:39] any of the dynamics as a child growing
[1:11:41] up other than these were the people in
[1:11:43] my life. And it was just the way it was.
[1:11:47] And I I think I even vaguely recall
[1:11:49] hearing them talk about faith healing. I
[1:11:54] I I was sure that I I heard them talk
[1:11:56] about it one time, but um I came to find
[1:11:59] out later that her parents tried
[1:12:02] desperately to get her to Calgary to be
[1:12:05] in some faith healing meetings back in
[1:12:07] the 50s.
[1:12:09] And that was Brother Brown's meetings.
[1:12:11] Amen.
[1:12:13] They tried to get her here, but it just
[1:12:15] didn't work out. For some reason, they
[1:12:16] couldn't get her here. And uh anyways,
[1:12:18] God rest her soul. She's gone on to her
[1:12:21] reward and Lord willing we'll see her
[1:12:25] again one
[1:12:26] day. When we moved to Calgary um we
[1:12:29] moved from a
[1:12:31] farm so from from the country. My dad
[1:12:35] was a farmer. He grew up on the farm and
[1:12:36] that's all he knew was farming. He came
[1:12:39] to the city, moved us into Dover into a
[1:12:42] a duplex. That's where we lived for the
[1:12:44] first few years. And you know, my my
[1:12:46] older brother tells a story of uh being
[1:12:49] 6 years old, how maybe he was even
[1:12:52] seven. He was in that range anyways. But
[1:12:55] in the winter time, it was very cold. He
[1:12:57] he went to school, uh I'm not sure, one
[1:13:00] of the schools real close there in
[1:13:01] Dover. And he came home and there's a
[1:13:03] bunch of duplexes all the same. He lived
[1:13:05] on the farm. He remembers what it was
[1:13:06] like to live on the farm with the dog
[1:13:08] and, you know, being in the country. And
[1:13:11] uh now he's in the city and he finds
[1:13:13] himself coming home from this new
[1:13:15] school. And what he did was he came into
[1:13:18] the house and he took off his coat and
[1:13:20] his gloves and he went and sat down in
[1:13:21] front of the television that was
[1:13:22] playing, which is what people did. It's
[1:13:25] what I did when I was growing up.
[1:13:26] There's always a TV in the house and you
[1:13:27] just go and sit down and and maybe, you
[1:13:29] know, warm up a little bit and then go
[1:13:31] and get some lunch. And my brother, he
[1:13:32] did that and he came to find out that he
[1:13:35] was actually in someone else's house.
[1:13:38] He wasn't in our house, but it was all
[1:13:41] brand new for him. He was just trying to
[1:13:43] navigate as a as a little guy and it was
[1:13:45] cold and found out that he was in the
[1:13:48] neighbor's house. But dad dad got us
[1:13:51] into this place in Dover. And then as
[1:13:54] time moved on, he was able to earn some
[1:13:56] money every way that he could. And uh
[1:14:00] you know, he worked real hard for our
[1:14:01] family in many ways. And uh he did
[1:14:06] various jobs. As I said, he was a farmer
[1:14:09] and he moved to the city and he he did
[1:14:10] all kinds of jobs. Whatever he could do,
[1:14:12] he never sat idle. He made sure that
[1:14:14] there was milk in the fridge, that there
[1:14:16] was food in the cupboard, and that we
[1:14:18] had clothing. And I'm certainly thankful
[1:14:21] for everything that my dad has done,
[1:14:23] including taking us to church. But he
[1:14:26] did exceptionally well with life
[1:14:29] insurance. After a while, he was able to
[1:14:31] get a job with life insurance and he
[1:14:33] became a life insurance salesman and
[1:14:35] went on to actually own a life insurance
[1:14:38] brokerage and uh you know he always
[1:14:41] provided the best he could for our
[1:14:43] family. Dad went on to have uh another
[1:14:46] marriage um after Carolyn passed away.
[1:14:51] Before he did, he had another child with
[1:14:54] Carolyn, my stepmother. And so I have a
[1:14:56] stepbrother Ian. And some folks here
[1:14:59] might have met him before, but he's my
[1:15:02] brother. I've never looked at him as my
[1:15:04] stepbrother. That's a technicality or
[1:15:06] formality to me, but uh anyways, um so
[1:15:11] there was five children that my dad had
[1:15:12] to provide for and a mortgage and
[1:15:15] vehicle and and he did it. He was able
[1:15:18] to do it by the grace of God. One of the
[1:15:20] first things that he did when he came to
[1:15:21] Cal Calgary with the family was he
[1:15:24] started attending a church in Calgary
[1:15:26] called Emanuel Church downtown. It's
[1:15:29] still there. It's on 1st Street and 17th
[1:15:32] Avenue. And that's the church that I was
[1:15:34] raised in. And uh we went every Sunday.
[1:15:38] There was two services every Sunday. And
[1:15:40] we had Wednesday services as well. It
[1:15:42] was a a a
[1:15:44] Pentecostal offshoot, if you will. And
[1:15:49] uh Pastor John Lucas II was the
[1:15:52] presiding pastor when when I was there.
[1:15:55] And it's interesting because this is a
[1:15:58] man he gave his life for
[1:16:00] Christ. I don't think that he was able
[1:16:02] to receive this message. I know that he
[1:16:04] wasn't. Um but I think that uh if I'm
[1:16:08] not mistaken, he is one of the longest
[1:16:11] serving clergy in the city of Calgary.
[1:16:14] He's about 85 years old. uh he might
[1:16:17] even be older, maybe 89 right now, but
[1:16:20] in his late 80s, he's still flying
[1:16:22] around the world to support Christians.
[1:16:25] He's not pastoring anymore. He is uh the
[1:16:28] president of an evangel evangelical
[1:16:31] society that raises money and uh
[1:16:34] distributes it. And as I understand, he
[1:16:37] has orphanages. His organization has
[1:16:40] orphanages all around the world. And two
[1:16:43] of them that are notable are in
[1:16:45] Philippines and in
[1:16:47] Mexico. And uh he's currently got a
[1:16:50] radio station, a radio ministry, I mean,
[1:16:52] not a radio station, but if you've ever
[1:16:55] listened to 11:40 a.m., he has something
[1:16:57] called the Sunrise Gospel Hour. And uh
[1:17:01] just uh fun fact, he is the one who
[1:17:05] actually helped us secure financing for
[1:17:07] this building right here. And uh I just
[1:17:11] think it's wonderful. He he was able to
[1:17:13] do that through a a company called Link
[1:17:15] Charity out of Toronto and uh it was
[1:17:18] just exactly what we needed at exactly
[1:17:20] the right time. And we know there's no
[1:17:22] accidents with God. Amen. It's a
[1:17:24] tremendous thing. He's a good man with
[1:17:27] an amazing record of helping people. His
[1:17:30] son currently presides over that church
[1:17:32] now as the pastor. He's uh John Lucas
[1:17:35] III and uh he's pastoring the same
[1:17:38] church. Um, and it's interesting. I I
[1:17:42] had met with him uh uh early on after I
[1:17:45] got saved. My dad had tried to get me to
[1:17:48] go and sit down with him and have lunch
[1:17:49] with him many times when he didn't know
[1:17:51] what to do with me. And uh as I was
[1:17:54] growing up and I thought, why would I
[1:17:55] ever go and sit down with a pastor when
[1:17:57] I'm a ranked sinner? I know where I'm
[1:17:59] at. And I'm not going to go and have
[1:18:02] lunch with this pastor guy. I don't
[1:18:04] think that's going to happen.
[1:18:06] And uh so once I got saved, I thought,
[1:18:08] you know, I really would like to sit
[1:18:09] down with him and just tell him God's
[1:18:12] done something for me. Like I'm I'm
[1:18:14] saved. Like I can't even explain it.
[1:18:18] Saved. And uh so I did. I met with him
[1:18:21] for lunch and uh we had a real good
[1:18:23] discussion and I told him what I was
[1:18:25] following. And some people had uh some
[1:18:30] people might have heard this before, but
[1:18:31] I just thought it was so good. this is
[1:18:33] the way this man operates. When I first
[1:18:36] got got into the message, call it this
[1:18:38] way, or or or better yet, when the
[1:18:40] message first got into me. And I went
[1:18:43] and told my dad, I expressed to him that
[1:18:45] something's happened to me, Dad. I I got
[1:18:47] saved and and and my life is different
[1:18:49] now. I'm I'm not rocking and rolling,
[1:18:51] and I'm not carrying on like I used to,
[1:18:54] and I'm I'm going to church now. And and
[1:18:56] I think my dad was just like a little
[1:18:58] bit unsure about what he was hearing
[1:18:59] from me. And and I he asked me, "Well,
[1:19:02] what is it? where you going? What are
[1:19:03] you doing? And I said, well, I don't
[1:19:04] really know what to tell you. The the
[1:19:06] church that I go to, I think they they
[1:19:08] follow a guy named William Brham. And I
[1:19:11] mean, this was very early on. And uh for
[1:19:14] my Christian walk, I mean, in the
[1:19:16] message and and he was quite concerned.
[1:19:18] He said, "I think I heard about him."
[1:19:20] And so, what did he do immediately? He
[1:19:22] phoned Pastor
[1:19:24] Lucas. What is this William Brham guy?
[1:19:26] What's he doing? and and John Lucas, his
[1:19:30] response was, "Is he serving
[1:19:32] God?" And he said, 'Well, yeah. And he
[1:19:34] said, 'Well, leave him
[1:19:37] alone. I thought, man, that was a real
[1:19:40] neat testimony.
[1:19:42] You know, we're we're here to get people
[1:19:44] to Christ. And as soon as we forget
[1:19:46] that, we've lost the the total meaning
[1:19:50] of what the gospel is.
[1:19:53] And so anyways,
[1:19:56] um meeting with uh I call him Pastor
[1:19:59] Lucas still. He's just always been
[1:20:00] Pastor Lucas. He probably always will
[1:20:02] be. When I met with him and and he
[1:20:04] started to express I asked him, you
[1:20:06] know, he he told me that he was in the
[1:20:08] meetings with Brother Brandham. And I
[1:20:10] said, "You were here in Calgary and
[1:20:11] Brother Brandham was here and you were
[1:20:13] in those meetings?" He said, "Yeah, we
[1:20:15] helped sponsor those meetings." And I
[1:20:17] was like, "Man, really? Wow." And he
[1:20:20] said, "Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. we were
[1:20:22] there and he said, you know, when he
[1:20:23] would preach, he had like five services
[1:20:25] or seven services, I can't remember what
[1:20:27] it was, but he said when he would
[1:20:28] preach, when the anointing would leave
[1:20:30] after the prayer line, he and Billy Paul
[1:20:33] Brandham would have to jump in and grab
[1:20:35] them or he would just collapse when the
[1:20:37] anointing would lift. And I thought,
[1:20:38] wow, that's incredible. Just just
[1:20:41] amazing to think that that man was there
[1:20:44] in those meetings. But, you know, the
[1:20:46] church that he was pastoring was an
[1:20:48] independent Pentecostal. In the 1970s,
[1:20:50] there was a Jesusonly movement going
[1:20:51] through North America and uh there was a
[1:20:54] lot of people, they call them the
[1:20:55] hippies. They were coming to church, the
[1:20:57] young people, you know, 1920 year olds.
[1:21:00] They were getting saved off the street
[1:21:01] in Calgary and they were coming into the
[1:21:03] church and they were a part of the
[1:21:04] Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, the
[1:21:05] PAOC. And some of the elders in the
[1:21:08] church were like, "Oo, we're getting
[1:21:09] uncomfortable. There's people getting
[1:21:10] saved here. They're they're getting a
[1:21:12] little bit out of order. They're getting
[1:21:14] a little bit excited. We like it nice
[1:21:16] and calm and collected. We don't want
[1:21:18] anybody getting too loud and excitable
[1:21:20] in our midst. Remember, Brother Bradom
[1:21:22] said, "We ought to be just as
[1:21:23] exuberant," Amen. as the people at their
[1:21:26] sporting events
[1:21:29] as Christians.
[1:21:31] But these people were getting
[1:21:32] uncomfortable with all these hippies
[1:21:33] coming in, all these young people. And
[1:21:35] so what did they do? They they actually
[1:21:37] told him, "You need to make a decision.
[1:21:38] You need to here's your ultimatum. You
[1:21:40] need to actually straighten up and stop
[1:21:42] doing that. you're making the elders
[1:21:44] uncomfortable or we're going to pull the
[1:21:47] actual accreditation of the Pentecostal
[1:21:49] assemblies. And he said, "Here, let me
[1:21:51] help you with that. You can have it."
[1:21:54] We're going to go on our own because
[1:21:56] we're here to get people to Christ.
[1:21:57] Amen. And I thought that was so good
[1:21:59] when I heard that because that's just
[1:22:01] exactly it, isn't it? Get people to
[1:22:03] Christ and let Christ do the work. It's
[1:22:05] not up to us to try and clean them up.
[1:22:08] But this was an independent Pentecostal
[1:22:09] church. Just to give you a little bit of
[1:22:10] a background where I come from there,
[1:22:12] man, there was healings, there was
[1:22:14] speaking in tongues, there was
[1:22:15] interpretations, there was prophesying,
[1:22:17] there was all of it. There was people
[1:22:18] slain in the spirit. All kinds of stuff
[1:22:21] were going on in this church. And you
[1:22:24] know, when I first came into the
[1:22:25] message, I remember thinking, man, it
[1:22:27] was all all wrong. They couldn't do
[1:22:30] that. It had to be terrible. Like, it
[1:22:32] had to be of the devil to do that. But
[1:22:34] when you really listen to the message
[1:22:35] and you hear what brother Brandham says,
[1:22:37] listen to the anointed ones at the end
[1:22:38] time. He says that it's the exact same
[1:22:41] anointing. Amen. It is not another
[1:22:44] anointing. There's only one anointing.
[1:22:46] Amen. And there's different vessels. And
[1:22:49] that's what happens. And that's why I
[1:22:51] love the word of God so much. If we just
[1:22:53] preach what the prophet taught, what
[1:22:56] will happen is that word of God will
[1:22:58] actually do the dividing. It will cause
[1:23:00] every single seed to grow.
[1:23:03] Good seed and bad seed. And there's
[1:23:06] nobody that can stop it. I think it's so
[1:23:08] beautiful. That's why I just love to
[1:23:10] quote the prophet. That's all we have to
[1:23:12] do is quote the prophet, speak the word
[1:23:14] of God, and watch that anointing take
[1:23:17] charge.
[1:23:18] But I recall this church that I was
[1:23:20] growing up in, it was a very dynamic
[1:23:21] church. And I I came to realize as a
[1:23:25] believer that it was the right
[1:23:26] anointing. It wasn't the wrong
[1:23:27] anointing. And you know, it it it made
[1:23:30] me real really desire it to see it as a
[1:23:33] child to see that this there's something
[1:23:35] going on here as a child. And I I I
[1:23:38] don't know. I don't want to just watch
[1:23:39] it. I I want to be a part of
[1:23:41] it. So at about age 10, I realized the
[1:23:46] importance of water baptism according to
[1:23:49] scripture. And so I I requested to get
[1:23:51] baptized. I I said I I would like to get
[1:23:54] baptized. If there's the free gift of a
[1:23:56] Holy Ghost going around, I I want I want
[1:23:58] one. I'd like to get my free gift so I
[1:24:01] can go home with it and study it and
[1:24:04] have it. And and you know, at this
[1:24:06] church, it was interesting. They had a
[1:24:08] real big ceremony. And I know every
[1:24:10] church is probably a little bit
[1:24:11] different, but there's a big stage and
[1:24:14] uh even if you go on their website, I
[1:24:15] was taking a look at it just recently.
[1:24:17] They've got a cutout in the back of the
[1:24:19] stage and they've got a baptismal tank
[1:24:21] right there. Many different churches
[1:24:22] have that, but this one was that way.
[1:24:24] And it was a it was a real interesting
[1:24:26] ceremony on a Sunday evening. and and I
[1:24:28] vividly remember it getting baptized in
[1:24:31] titles and uh I didn't feel anything. I
[1:24:35] I know that it happened. I know that my
[1:24:37] desire was there but I didn't feel
[1:24:39] anything. And it's so beautiful to think
[1:24:41] that we shouldn't feel something
[1:24:43] necessarily getting baptized. That's
[1:24:45] right. It's not about emotion. That's
[1:24:47] right. Sometimes people try and make it
[1:24:50] that way, but it's not that way. So
[1:24:52] after some time after getting baptized,
[1:24:55] nothing was changing. Nothing happened.
[1:24:57] I didn't feel anything. I didn't see
[1:24:59] anything. Everything was the same. I I
[1:25:01] as actually asked for some followup. I I
[1:25:03] said, "Hey, can can you help me get a
[1:25:05] handle on this here? I I'd like to learn
[1:25:08] more about it. How how am I supposed to
[1:25:10] get it? What am I supposed to do to
[1:25:12] exercise it or see it or handle it or
[1:25:15] whatever." And and so they they paired
[1:25:18] me up with someone to to maybe mentor me
[1:25:20] a little bit. And and and they took me
[1:25:22] on a Saturday into the church and and we
[1:25:24] began to pray. and and he said basically
[1:25:26] you just need to pray and and once you
[1:25:28] pray after a certain amount of time it
[1:25:31] will start to actually well up inside of
[1:25:33] you and before long you'll actually be
[1:25:34] speaking in tongues and you'll have the
[1:25:36] initial evidence to know that you've got
[1:25:37] the Holy Ghost in your life. And I I
[1:25:40] thought okay I think if that's the way
[1:25:42] it is. I mean that's what's happening in
[1:25:44] the services. I really would like to see
[1:25:46] it. So, I watched the brother pray and I
[1:25:50] watched him speak in tongues and and and
[1:25:53] I thought, you know, I don't know, man,
[1:25:54] if I can do that. I don't know if that's
[1:25:56] actually going to work for me. But, uh,
[1:25:59] I'll try it. We came this far. So, I
[1:26:02] actually tried and and prayed and, you
[1:26:04] know, I just couldn't do it. And and and
[1:26:06] I said to him, it just I can't do it. I
[1:26:08] don't know. It's just not working. And I
[1:26:09] know I remember thinking they probably
[1:26:13] think I just there's no hope for me at
[1:26:15] that point. And I know that was the
[1:26:17] devil right there in my head saying
[1:26:19] there's no hope for you. You're, you
[1:26:20] know, you're not going to follow suit.
[1:26:23] You're just going to go and uh get
[1:26:24] washed up somewhere out out in the
[1:26:26] world. And uh so I said, you know,
[1:26:29] whatever. It doesn't sit right with me.
[1:26:31] So I just couldn't do it. In uh sort of
[1:26:34] parallel with all of this in my school
[1:26:37] life, um it was pretty good. I had a
[1:26:41] pretty good school life. I had a pretty
[1:26:43] good upbringing in my house. There was
[1:26:46] some confusion as I mentioned a little
[1:26:47] earlier with my stepmother's illness.
[1:26:50] Um, paralleling what I was just
[1:26:52] describing in church though, my school
[1:26:54] life, it was pretty good up until about
[1:26:56] grade
[1:26:57] five. And what happened at about grade
[1:27:00] five was I started to fall under the
[1:27:03] influence of other
[1:27:06] people. And what it was was the wrong
[1:27:10] people. I remember vividly there was
[1:27:13] good people and there was bad people.
[1:27:14] Call it good people, bad people. They're
[1:27:16] all wonderful people. They just were in
[1:27:19] situations in their lives where they
[1:27:23] were acting out because of whatever the
[1:27:25] the behind-the-scenes situations were
[1:27:27] for them and their lives. And what
[1:27:29] happened was I was I was
[1:27:32] unfortunately I I fell under the wrong
[1:27:35] influence of so-called friends. And you
[1:27:38] know, I I don't say this to give the
[1:27:41] devil any glory. I I say these things to
[1:27:44] give God the glory. I want everyone who
[1:27:47] might hear my voice, either live or
[1:27:50] recorded, to understand that this is not
[1:27:53] about glorifying this flesh or the
[1:27:56] devil. It's what happened. Maybe we
[1:27:59] could call it an agreed statement of
[1:28:01] facts.
[1:28:03] But you know, these wrong
[1:28:06] influencers, they caused me to do things
[1:28:08] that I didn't really want to do. One of
[1:28:11] them was to listen to rock and roll. I
[1:28:14] remember going over to a friend's house.
[1:28:15] I probably said this many times, but
[1:28:17] maybe some people haven't heard it when
[1:28:18] I was young. I would go over to this
[1:28:20] friend's house and he had all the cars,
[1:28:22] the little toy cars and all the balls.
[1:28:24] He had all the toys and and I had very
[1:28:26] little toys at home and and I always
[1:28:28] wanted to go and play with him at his
[1:28:30] house and and hang out with him when I
[1:28:31] was young. really young, like five, six
[1:28:33] years old. And uh he would always play
[1:28:37] for a little while, but then he had this
[1:28:38] little record player, a 33 or 45 record
[1:28:42] player. It was like a pressed cardboard
[1:28:44] thing with a little lid on it and he
[1:28:45] slide it under his bed, but he pulled it
[1:28:47] out and his his brother or someone gave
[1:28:49] him this broken record. It had a chip
[1:28:51] out of the corner of it and it was a
[1:28:52] Beatles album. And he'd always want to
[1:28:54] play this Beatles album. And I would
[1:28:56] think, why do you want to do that? This
[1:28:58] is such a stupid waste of time. Why
[1:29:00] don't we just play cars? Why don't we do
[1:29:02] something useful like little boys do?
[1:29:04] But no, no, no. He wanted to play this
[1:29:06] music. And so I would say to him, I I'm
[1:29:08] not going to listen to rock and roll. I
[1:29:09] know rock and roll is bad. So I'm going
[1:29:11] to go home. And he would say, oh, come
[1:29:13] on. Don't go. And he'd close it and put
[1:29:15] it under his bed. And that happened two
[1:29:16] or three times. And then eventually he
[1:29:18] said, "You know what?
[1:29:20] Go." And I was like, "Oh no, now what? I
[1:29:26] want I want to stay and play. He's my
[1:29:27] friend or something. I don't know what
[1:29:29] to do. So I re relented to the
[1:29:32] influence. I didn't want to listen to
[1:29:34] rock. I didn't want
[1:29:35] to. But it was a situation I found
[1:29:38] myself in. And the only way that I could
[1:29:39] do what I wanted to do was to allow
[1:29:42] that. And what that was was the
[1:29:44] fingernail of the devil in my life in
[1:29:47] the door to just get it open just a
[1:29:49] little bit. He doesn't need much, man.
[1:29:51] He doesn't need much at all. He just
[1:29:53] needs a sliver of room. And so anyways,
[1:29:56] this influence of rock and roll started.
[1:29:58] It started, it was a seed that was
[1:30:00] planted in my life and it didn't
[1:30:02] actually grow until I was an adult till
[1:30:05] way later in my life. But here I was,
[1:30:08] grade five. Another influence that
[1:30:11] happened in my life was kids at school
[1:30:14] had
[1:30:15] cigarettes. Grade
[1:30:17] five. I don't even know how old you
[1:30:19] would be in grade five.
[1:30:22] 11. Seven. 10.
[1:30:26] cigarettes. First time I tasted weed,
[1:30:29] grade
[1:30:30] five. Got high and and foolishly ran to
[1:30:34] school because I was
[1:30:36] late. But that's what I
[1:30:38] did. I began smoking cigarettes as a
[1:30:41] regular thing. It wasn't just a a a
[1:30:43] sample thing. It was a regular thing in
[1:30:46] grade six. Grade six was a real turning
[1:30:48] point in my life. I began to associate
[1:30:52] with children who were troubled at that
[1:30:54] point. And I I remember one time in in
[1:30:56] the car with my family and uh there was
[1:30:59] static at home. It wasn't really good.
[1:31:01] Maybe I was I was probably misbehaving.
[1:31:03] I can't remember the exact
[1:31:04] circumstances, but I remember very well
[1:31:06] vividly being in the back of my dad's
[1:31:07] station wagon coming out of 52nd Street
[1:31:11] and Memorial Drive shopping plaza there.
[1:31:13] There used to be a Texico gas station
[1:31:15] right on the corner. We were coming out
[1:31:16] of there and we're going to go, I think,
[1:31:18] to the farm to my to my grandma's and
[1:31:20] Claire's home that day. And and anyways,
[1:31:22] I had a pack of cigarettes in my pocket
[1:31:24] and I was thinking, how am I going to be
[1:31:26] able to smoke these cigarettes with my
[1:31:27] family around? Am I going to be able to
[1:31:30] not be smelled and just get away with
[1:31:32] it? And I had them in my pocket and I
[1:31:34] was in grade six at the time. And I
[1:31:35] remember hearing a
[1:31:38] voice, audible, I don't know, in my
[1:31:40] heart, I don't know. I heard it. That's
[1:31:43] all I know. And that voice said, "You'll
[1:31:45] never make it without me."
[1:31:48] And I remember thinking, "What is
[1:31:50] that? What is that? Is that God? I don't
[1:31:53] know. I don't know." And I just carried
[1:31:55] on. But here I am, 52 years old. I
[1:31:58] remember it
[1:31:59] vividly. I began to associate with
[1:32:02] children who were in trouble because of
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:07] ease. The devil loves it for it to be
[1:32:10] easy for us, brothers and sisters. It is
[1:32:14] harder to walk the right way.
[1:32:18] The easy way is the devil's way.
[1:32:22] To all the young people, I'm speaking to
[1:32:24] you right now. You know, because of the
[1:32:27] disease of my stepmother, it was very
[1:32:30] difficult for her to parent actively. It
[1:32:33] was very difficult. So, what it did was
[1:32:35] it caused a bit of a maybe a leadership
[1:32:37] or a parental vacuum in our home. And so
[1:32:41] I was able to do a lot of things without
[1:32:44] her knowledge. One of them being able to
[1:32:46] smoke. And uh you know my dad I I don't
[1:32:50] hold him responsible for it. He was busy
[1:32:54] working hard to try and support the
[1:32:56] family. And he did he did a great job
[1:32:59] with it. But you know in doing that as
[1:33:03] the sole provider he wasn't around much.
[1:33:05] He didn't have a university degree or a
[1:33:07] college degree. He he didn't have a a
[1:33:10] tremendous salary coming in like uh some
[1:33:13] folks might have in doing that. Um he
[1:33:16] had his own business and having your own
[1:33:18] business means that you have got to be
[1:33:20] fully engaged. There's no time off. The
[1:33:24] time off means no pay. So anyways, he
[1:33:27] works real hard and yeah, I just want to
[1:33:29] say this for parents. Life gets busy.
[1:33:32] And if I just could make a suggestion,
[1:33:34] please don't allow yourself to get so
[1:33:36] busy that you can't connect with your
[1:33:38] children. Don't allow yourself to get so
[1:33:40] busy that you don't know where your
[1:33:42] child is at in his life, in her life,
[1:33:44] who's whose friends they're hanging out
[1:33:46] with, what the influence is in their
[1:33:49] life. Because if you can see that it's
[1:33:51] going the wrong way, you need to take
[1:33:53] decisive action. You, as the parent,
[1:33:56] you've got to do it. Amen. You can't
[1:33:58] just tell them, "Don't do that." If you
[1:34:01] do, they're just going to do that. Amen.
[1:34:04] And sure, you take the time to develop
[1:34:06] relationships so that they value the
[1:34:09] discussion and and when they do, they'll
[1:34:12] listen. You know what? When I came to uh
[1:34:14] the end of grade six and it came to
[1:34:17] grade seven, I I hope I'm not boring
[1:34:19] everyone with this. It seems weird, but
[1:34:21] I I'm just getting into the good stuff
[1:34:23] here now. The Lord really did something
[1:34:24] for me. when I when I started to get
[1:34:27] into grade seven is when I I I really
[1:34:29] started to the wheels started to fall
[1:34:32] off the wagon as it were. And uh when I
[1:34:35] went into grade seven, I was lost, man.
[1:34:38] I I I I don't know how I even functioned
[1:34:41] as I did, but I was just going through
[1:34:42] the motions. We get up and go to school
[1:34:44] and then we come home. Get up and go to
[1:34:45] school, come home. And you know, I
[1:34:47] didn't know how to
[1:34:49] study. I I found myself in a situation
[1:34:52] where homework was almost impossible for
[1:34:55] me. And I'm not trying to make excuses
[1:34:57] for it. I'm not trying to make excuses
[1:34:59] for any of this. It's just like I said,
[1:35:01] maybe an agreed statement of facts. It's
[1:35:03] just the way life was for me in my life.
[1:35:06] And you know, as this progressed, I
[1:35:09] began to become distant even to myself.
[1:35:13] I I didn't even really know who I was. I
[1:35:16] didn't know who I was supposed to be. I
[1:35:18] I didn't know what should happen. I I
[1:35:21] know that my dad said just go to school
[1:35:24] and get good grades, but I didn't know
[1:35:26] how to do that. I I couldn't put it
[1:35:30] together to be able to do that. My older
[1:35:32] brother was doing it fine. My older
[1:35:33] sisters were doing it fine, but I just
[1:35:36] couldn't do it fine. It just wasn't
[1:35:37] happening for me. It wasn't connecting.
[1:35:39] So, I became to become even more and
[1:35:42] more distant from the family. I became
[1:35:44] more and more distant. I was basically
[1:35:47] done church by then and uh just wasn't
[1:35:50] into it. If I went, I would be falling
[1:35:52] asleep or I would be getting up and
[1:35:54] going anywhere so long as I didn't have
[1:35:56] to sit in the seat too long. But my
[1:35:59] grade averages were terrible. And and
[1:36:01] you know what happened was because of
[1:36:03] the influence of the people that I was
[1:36:05] hanging out with, one of the kids that I
[1:36:07] hung out with, his parents gave him
[1:36:09] cigarettes. This was grade seven. We'd
[1:36:12] go to his house for lunch and I would
[1:36:13] sit there and watch him eat lunch and I
[1:36:16] never had a lunch and then his parents
[1:36:18] would give each of us a cigarette and
[1:36:20] that was the thrill of the day and then
[1:36:22] we would go to school and do nothing and
[1:36:24] it became a race to the bottom and grade
[1:36:28] averages were terrible, absolutely
[1:36:29] terrible. And uh I failed grade seven at
[1:36:33] Earnest Moral Junior High School. And
[1:36:36] that year, while I was busy failing
[1:36:38] school, I got picked up for shoplifting,
[1:36:40] if you could believe it. It was just
[1:36:42] following the perfect pattern to go the
[1:36:45] wrong way with my life. And you know, it
[1:36:48] was it was just the grace of the Lord
[1:36:50] that allowed this to happen because I
[1:36:52] got charged. I got prosecuted. And when
[1:36:56] I was in court, I'm just thankful to the
[1:36:59] Lord that I was handed a total
[1:37:02] discharge. My dad went and actually
[1:37:04] petitioned for me before the judge. And
[1:37:07] you know, it I remember it vividly. He
[1:37:10] actually took the responsibility for it
[1:37:12] all himself. He said, "It's my
[1:37:15] responsibility. I failed my son. A and
[1:37:18] for me, it never left me. And and I'm so
[1:37:20] thankful that he was able to do that for
[1:37:23] me, that he was willing to do that for
[1:37:25] me. And you know, it just makes me
[1:37:26] think, brothers and sisters, we have a
[1:37:28] father, too. One day, we're going to
[1:37:30] stand before a judge. And to know what
[1:37:31] that feeling is like, to not know what
[1:37:33] the outcome is going to be like, but to
[1:37:35] have someone that will petition for us
[1:37:38] in front of a judge, man, when we have
[1:37:40] no hope on our own, what a tremendous
[1:37:42] thing it is. Thank you, Dad, for doing
[1:37:44] that.
[1:37:46] My because of this my dad saw there was
[1:37:50] there was need for some some serious
[1:37:52] action had to take place in my life. We
[1:37:54] could not just allow him to continue on
[1:37:56] in in the trajectory that he's on
[1:37:58] hanging out with these kids. He didn't
[1:38:00] know my friends by the way. He had no
[1:38:03] idea who my friends were. He didn't know
[1:38:05] any of the stuff that was going on in my
[1:38:07] life. He just saw that Barry got picked
[1:38:09] up for shoplifting and that his grades
[1:38:10] were terrible and he's distant. we got
[1:38:13] to do something about this kid. So he
[1:38:15] took me and was able to arrange with my
[1:38:17] grandmother in ClariSome, that was his
[1:38:19] mom, to go live with her. So in
[1:38:22] February, weather like this outside,
[1:38:24] never forget it, really cold, the city
[1:38:27] boy moves to the country and I get
[1:38:29] introduced in the country school class.
[1:38:31] We have a new student and and it was
[1:38:33] just this this thing. It was so
[1:38:35] difficult to be the city boy introduced
[1:38:37] into a country school. It it was not an
[1:38:40] easy integration. Although the people
[1:38:42] there were were mostly very
[1:38:45] kind. It was so tremendous to live with
[1:38:48] my grandma. You know, my uh siblings, my
[1:38:51] my older sister will say even today, how
[1:38:53] is it that you get to misbehave and you
[1:38:55] get to pass to go and live with grandma
[1:38:58] and we all have to stay living
[1:39:01] here. But it's the way the Lord works.
[1:39:03] And uh you know, because of this, I was
[1:39:06] absolutely shocked to see that there was
[1:39:10] a different life.
[1:39:11] there was a different way of living from
[1:39:14] the way that I was experiencing at home.
[1:39:16] And uh it's just the way it worked out.
[1:39:18] I'm not laying blame or fault to anyone.
[1:39:21] And the reason I keep saying that is
[1:39:23] because for years, brothers and sisters,
[1:39:24] I I was at the place where I hated my
[1:39:26] mom. I'll say it. I I was at the place
[1:39:29] where I hated my dad. I'll say that,
[1:39:31] too. And I blamed them for everything.
[1:39:34] My mom, she didn't do this. My mom, she
[1:39:37] did do this. My dad, he didn't do this.
[1:39:39] my dad, he did do this, all these
[1:39:41] things. And you know, I would go and
[1:39:43] talk and talk and talk about all these
[1:39:44] people to other people and other people
[1:39:47] probably scratched their head and
[1:39:48] thought, "Man, this guy's troubled.
[1:39:50] There's something wrong with him." But
[1:39:52] you know what happened was I had to come
[1:39:54] to the place where I recognized that
[1:39:56] neither one of my parents were
[1:39:58] superheroes.
[1:40:00] They were only human beings.
[1:40:02] And both of my parents were fallible
[1:40:05] human beings. It's shocking. I know it.
[1:40:07] But young people here today, hear my
[1:40:09] words. Your parents are fallible human
[1:40:12] beings. Amen. They make mistakes and
[1:40:15] they will make mistakes. Amen. But we
[1:40:18] forgive them. We love them just like
[1:40:22] they forgive our mistakes and they love
[1:40:25] us. But because of this, I got to go and
[1:40:28] live with my grandmother Doris Johnson
[1:40:30] in Claire's home. I got to go to a
[1:40:33] Pentecostal church. And you know, one of
[1:40:35] the things that uh really captured my
[1:40:38] attention when I came to church the very
[1:40:39] first time was it was just like
[1:40:41] grandma's church. When you came into
[1:40:43] service, there wasn't people talking.
[1:40:45] They weren't moving around. They came
[1:40:46] in, they sat down, they meditated, there
[1:40:49] was soft music playing in the
[1:40:50] background. You could feel the spirit of
[1:40:52] God moving in the building. Amen. I
[1:40:54] remember it vividly going to grandma's
[1:40:56] church and you did not talk. If you did,
[1:41:01] whack. She made sure you knew, right?
[1:41:05] Grandma was uh call it old
[1:41:09] school. She made sure you knew. But in
[1:41:12] anyways, in Claire's home, the
[1:41:14] environment was good. The people wanted
[1:41:16] to prosper and I was able to get the
[1:41:18] influence to just barely pass grade
[1:41:20] seven. And although I had good good
[1:41:24] times in school and made some good
[1:41:26] friends down there, I still was
[1:41:27] rebellious in my spirit. I still had
[1:41:29] that, you know, be home for supper at
[1:41:31] 6:00. I would turn up at 6:30. Grandma
[1:41:35] would be fit to be tied would be exact
[1:41:37] phrase that she would use. She would be
[1:41:39] hot and I'd be like, "Why are you so
[1:41:41] mad?" Like, "What's up?" And and she
[1:41:44] would be like, "No, no, no. You you come
[1:41:46] home when you're told to be coming
[1:41:47] home." And I just couldn't understand
[1:41:49] that at the time. It just wasn't
[1:41:50] computing at all in my in my being. So,
[1:41:54] she said, you know, we just can't do
[1:41:55] this anymore. And I had to come back to
[1:41:57] Calgary. And you know it was right
[1:41:59] around this time just before this that I
[1:42:01] had gone through the desire to uh get
[1:42:04] the Holy Ghost in my life to get the
[1:42:06] baptism and uh coming back to Calgary
[1:42:10] was not a really positive thing for me
[1:42:14] to look forward to. I really did not
[1:42:17] want to come back to Calgary because
[1:42:18] there wasn't a whole lot of positive
[1:42:20] like I said to look forward to um in the
[1:42:23] family life. So, I went for the
[1:42:26] attention that I could get when I got
[1:42:27] back to Calgary because I had to come
[1:42:29] back. And that was with the troubled
[1:42:31] people again because it was so easy to
[1:42:33] be accepted. And you know, the troubled
[1:42:36] people at this stage were more troubled.
[1:42:39] They weren't just a little troubled,
[1:42:40] they were more troubled. And the
[1:42:42] acceptance was pretty easy. And I just I
[1:42:46] think it's so important for the young
[1:42:48] people to recognize what can appear as
[1:42:50] easy when you're young. Hear my words
[1:42:53] now. Every young person in the building,
[1:42:55] every young person that would listen to
[1:42:57] this later, every single one of you
[1:43:00] listen. What can appear as easy when
[1:43:03] you're young can curse the rest of your
[1:43:07] entire life. Amen.
[1:43:12] I'm a living witness to that. I've got
[1:43:15] scars. I I'm telling you, I would love
[1:43:17] to have a university education now. I'd
[1:43:20] love to have some kind of college
[1:43:21] education. I'd love to have had a career
[1:43:23] where I could say I've got investments
[1:43:26] and I've got I've got pensions and I've
[1:43:28] got all of these things, but I chose a
[1:43:31] different route and and I thank God for
[1:43:33] it now. I can look at it and say,
[1:43:35] "Thanks be to God because I am where I'm
[1:43:38] supposed to be. I know it." I've told
[1:43:40] people since I've been a pastor, they
[1:43:41] say, "What's it like being a pastor?"
[1:43:42] And I say, you know, for the first time
[1:43:44] in my life, I know I'm where I'm
[1:43:46] supposed to be. And alls I can do is
[1:43:49] rejoice at that. Amen.
[1:43:53] But just because it seems easy, it
[1:43:55] doesn't doesn't don't mean it's right.
[1:43:56] I'm telling you, be careful. So, I began
[1:44:00] to meet people now outside of school.
[1:44:02] Influences outside of school. How'd that
[1:44:04] happen? Let me tell you,
[1:44:08] parties. Hey, Barry, we're going to have
[1:44:10] a party. It's going to be at 7:00 at
[1:44:13] this address. It's going to be awesome.
[1:44:14] There's going to be this. There's going
[1:44:15] to be that. There's going to be them.
[1:44:17] Let's go. And I'd be like, "Oh, man. I
[1:44:19] don't know if I can get out. But I don't
[1:44:20] know if my parents will let me. I don't
[1:44:22] know. I don't know, man. Sometimes I'd
[1:44:24] have to wait until my parents were in
[1:44:25] bed and then open the window and jump
[1:44:26] out and
[1:44:28] go. But guess what? These people were
[1:44:33] even worse influence. These people were
[1:44:36] bad news. And you know what? Came to the
[1:44:38] place where I began to detest school. As
[1:44:40] I was going through all of this, I
[1:44:43] skipped out on many classes. After
[1:44:45] living in Clarison with my grandmother,
[1:44:46] I came to Calgary and and and my dad
[1:44:49] enrolled me into something that he
[1:44:52] thought would actually fix me. And and I
[1:44:54] say, "Thank you, Dad, for for doing
[1:44:57] that, but it just didn't work." And that
[1:45:00] was to enroll me in Heritage Christian
[1:45:02] Academy. If anybody has ever heard of
[1:45:03] it, it's a pretty popular Christian
[1:45:05] school in the city now, but uh it was a
[1:45:08] bit smaller at the time. Again, my
[1:45:10] sister, she really wanted to go to that
[1:45:12] school, Heritage Christians. She said to
[1:45:14] me, "How is it that you get into trouble
[1:45:15] and you get to do all the good things?"
[1:45:18] I say, "I don't know. I wish I didn't
[1:45:19] have to go here, but here I am." And and
[1:45:22] it went from bad to worse there. I
[1:45:24] vividly recall being berated and
[1:45:26] humiliated by the math teacher. And and
[1:45:29] I won't name him. His name is in my
[1:45:31] head, but I just don't want to slander
[1:45:33] anybody. But, you know, maybe you've
[1:45:34] seen a movie. Maybe you've heard stories
[1:45:37] about kids in school and how the teacher
[1:45:39] would come and berate them in front of
[1:45:41] everyone. And maybe they've got the
[1:45:43] wrong book, the wrong binder. I only had
[1:45:46] one binder. I didn't care. I just
[1:45:48] carried a binder to every class. I
[1:45:51] didn't have any study. No, you know, I
[1:45:53] was terrible. And I'm not saying this to
[1:45:55] glorify my my incompetence. I'm saying
[1:45:59] it because the Lord really did something
[1:46:01] for me. Amen. And if you want to see how
[1:46:04] much he did for me, let's have a
[1:46:05] discussion about our children and what
[1:46:07] they're doing in school now. But here I
[1:46:10] find myself in a situation. I'm enrolled
[1:46:12] in this Christian school. I don't want
[1:46:13] nothing to do with church. I don't want
[1:46:15] nothing to do with Jesus people. I don't
[1:46:17] want nothing to do with any of this
[1:46:19] religion stuff. I don't want to be in
[1:46:21] school. And here I am being forced to go
[1:46:23] to this place now. And and this guy,
[1:46:25] this one teacher, he would come and and
[1:46:26] and pick on me in front of everyone
[1:46:29] instead of actually trying to help me.
[1:46:31] He would open my binder and scream at
[1:46:33] me, "What is this?" and he would start
[1:46:35] tearing pages out of the binder and rip
[1:46:37] it out and make a big huge scene in
[1:46:39] front of everyone and then tell me to
[1:46:41] get out of my class and you should, you
[1:46:44] know, just on and on and on. I still
[1:46:45] have vivid nightmares about doing
[1:46:48] homework and not having homework done
[1:46:50] and not being ready to write the test.
[1:46:52] That is a very real dream of mine that
[1:46:55] still happens in my life. And you know
[1:46:57] what? It's my fault. I don't blame the
[1:46:59] teacher, but he was pretty harsh. He
[1:47:01] could have been nicer. And ironically,
[1:47:03] this was the guy that taught
[1:47:05] religion. He was the religion teacher,
[1:47:08] and he just loved to go on about the
[1:47:10] Godhead. Oh my goodness. The three
[1:47:13] persons of the Godhead. I vividly
[1:47:15] remember it, too. The triangle of
[1:47:17] circles. He He just would go on about
[1:47:19] that. The irony. Hey. So, after this
[1:47:22] school year was done, in my mind, it was
[1:47:27] over. I I was finished with school.
[1:47:32] But uh my dad had different plans. And
[1:47:35] what did he do? He didn't know what to
[1:47:36] do with me. So he he just gave me over
[1:47:39] to the Lord and he said, "You know, we
[1:47:41] just have to get you back in school
[1:47:42] again." So he put me back in Ernest
[1:47:43] Mororrow junior high. And uh so I found
[1:47:47] myself
[1:47:49] back back in Hearn Moral for my second
[1:47:53] year now of uh this was my first year of
[1:47:58] grade 8
[1:47:59] actually in uh Earnest Moral. And so
[1:48:03] while I was there, I was halfway through
[1:48:06] this this school year in in grade eight
[1:48:10] and uh just barely passing grade seven.
[1:48:13] And the vice principal, he said to me,
[1:48:15] you know,
[1:48:17] um, you need to get out. You're wasting
[1:48:20] everyone's time. We don't want nothing
[1:48:23] to do with you. If you want to go to
[1:48:24] school, just go across the field to
[1:48:26] Forest Lawn High and register there.
[1:48:29] They'll help you. And, and I know what
[1:48:31] he was doing. He was going like this,
[1:48:32] just washing his hands. He didn't want
[1:48:34] nothing to do with it. It was just a
[1:48:35] problem child, another problem child for
[1:48:38] him to deal with. And at the time, there
[1:48:39] was a lot of problem children in that
[1:48:41] school. I don't know how it is now, but
[1:48:43] it was pretty problemmed then. And he
[1:48:46] was just seeing me as that. And you
[1:48:48] know, in my heart, I was like dancing a
[1:48:51] jig. Glory to God. I don't have to go to
[1:48:54] school anymore. Hallelujah. And my dad,
[1:48:57] he took a different stand on it. He
[1:48:59] said, "You will go to school. It'll be
[1:49:00] in the fall at Forest Lawn High, and
[1:49:03] until then, you'll get a
[1:49:05] job." So I said, "Okay, I'd love to
[1:49:07] work. I prefer to work, actually." So he
[1:49:10] he connected me with a friend and I went
[1:49:12] lived in Golden for a little while and
[1:49:14] lived out there and worked as a mechanic
[1:49:16] helper and sort of got my hands uh
[1:49:19] introduced to mechanics and it was kind
[1:49:22] of an interesting thing. But you know
[1:49:24] that uh that tenure wore out and I had
[1:49:28] to come back to Calgary and I had to
[1:49:29] face the music as it were and began
[1:49:33] school in grade
[1:49:34] 10. And what's interesting about this is
[1:49:38] as I began grade 10, I was missing a
[1:49:42] huge part of the concepts that I should
[1:49:44] have learned in grade seven and grade 8
[1:49:47] and grade nine. There was no grade nine.
[1:49:50] It was just grade seven, sort of a bit
[1:49:53] of grade 8 and then grade
[1:49:56] 10. So because of that, I I thought, you
[1:49:59] know, for everybody's sake, I'll just
[1:50:01] give it a try. I'll just give it a try.
[1:50:03] We'll keep the peace. and I went and uh
[1:50:06] I got about halfway through the first
[1:50:08] semester and uh biochem was a breeze for
[1:50:11] some reason I was able to do it. It was
[1:50:13] it was a breeze and maybe it was just
[1:50:15] simple stuff in the beginning. I don't
[1:50:17] know. But the rest of it I just couldn't
[1:50:19] do. And uh you know after after that
[1:50:22] first little bit I I was done with
[1:50:24] school. I was just out. I quit and uh
[1:50:27] found myself with nothing to do except
[1:50:30] for hang out with those people that I
[1:50:32] shouldn't hang out with. And uh my dad
[1:50:35] said to me, he you know what? If you're
[1:50:36] going to live in my house, you're going
[1:50:37] to work or you're going to go to school.
[1:50:39] You're going to do one of the two
[1:50:40] things. And if you work, you're going to
[1:50:41] pay me rent. You are not going to sit
[1:50:43] here and just freeload. It's not my
[1:50:46] responsibility to support a dead beat. I
[1:50:49] taught you better. You chose different.
[1:50:52] Now, A or B, school or work, whichever
[1:50:55] it's going to be. And so, it took me
[1:50:57] some time to connect the dots on how
[1:50:59] life works. I went and hung out with
[1:51:01] some of these people and saw that you
[1:51:04] know what? If you do anything in life,
[1:51:05] if you want to do anything in this life,
[1:51:08] you're going to have to dig in your
[1:51:09] pocket first. You're going to have to
[1:51:11] dig in your pocket first and see if
[1:51:13] you've got enough money to do what
[1:51:15] you're thinking about doing. Otherwise,
[1:51:17] all of the advantages, the things that
[1:51:19] people paint and portray online to make
[1:51:22] it look so glamorous and fun, forget
[1:51:24] about it. And that's what I had to
[1:51:27] learn. Oh my, I need to forget about a
[1:51:29] lot of things in life now. And you know
[1:51:31] what happened was I I was able to
[1:51:33] connect the dots in my life and and
[1:51:35] recognize that you either work hard in
[1:51:37] school to work less hard in your career
[1:51:40] or you take it
[1:51:43] easy in school and realize one day. I
[1:51:47] was having this conversation with Isaac.
[1:51:49] What would it be like to one day
[1:51:52] realize I made a mistake that I can't
[1:51:55] fix and now for the rest of my life I'm
[1:51:58] going to have to pay for that
[1:52:00] mistake and that was just
[1:52:03] education. Sometimes people do that in
[1:52:06] relationships and children come on the
[1:52:09] scene. There's things that can happen in
[1:52:11] life, brothers and sisters, if we're not
[1:52:13] willing to follow the leadership of the
[1:52:15] Lord, the leadership of our parents,
[1:52:16] which is the leadership of the Lord. We
[1:52:18] can have lifong
[1:52:22] consequences. It took me some time to
[1:52:24] connect the dots on how life works. You
[1:52:27] either work hard in school or you take
[1:52:30] it easy in school and you will reap the
[1:52:33] rewards. But you know, for me, I grew up
[1:52:37] in a situation where we didn't have a
[1:52:39] lot and I I just desired to go and get a
[1:52:44] life. And it sounds real terrible, but I
[1:52:47] I just that's kind of the way it felt.
[1:52:50] If if I was going to have it in my life
[1:52:52] now, I recognize fully there was no
[1:52:54] tether to my parents. There was no we're
[1:52:56] just going to, you know, give you some
[1:52:58] living. We're just going to give you
[1:52:59] some support. They they help me in in
[1:53:02] terms of different things along the way.
[1:53:04] I'm not saying they didn't, but I
[1:53:06] recognize now because I had forfeited my
[1:53:08] schooling, my chance at
[1:53:11] schooling. It was up to me if I was
[1:53:13] going to have any money in my pocket, if
[1:53:15] I was going to be able to check and see
[1:53:16] whether I could do that thing or not. It
[1:53:18] was up to me. No one Dad wasn't just
[1:53:21] going to give me a credit card. He
[1:53:22] wasn't just going to say, "I'll just
[1:53:23] give you money and you can go skiing
[1:53:25] with your friends." No, no, no, no, no.
[1:53:27] If there was going to be any fun to be
[1:53:28] had, it was because I worked to get that
[1:53:31] money. So being being a bum and living
[1:53:35] broke, it was never an option for me. I
[1:53:38] came to know many many of those bums who
[1:53:42] were broke in my years of delinquency.
[1:53:45] And I went and I got a job. I I had
[1:53:48] tried many different jobs.
[1:53:51] Um, one job that I got which I had
[1:53:55] potentially told at different times was
[1:53:58] uh one of these one of these people who
[1:54:00] were a bit
[1:54:02] unsaavory actually worked as a shoe
[1:54:04] repair at a shoe repair. And I I said to
[1:54:07] him, "Can you get me a job? I think
[1:54:08] that's something I could do. I
[1:54:10] potentially could do it. I mean, if you
[1:54:11] could do it, obviously I could do it,
[1:54:14] right?"
[1:54:15] So uh anyways after much proddding and
[1:54:18] bugging he was able to get me a job and
[1:54:20] I was so immature in in my thinking in
[1:54:24] my ways but what happened was I was able
[1:54:27] to demonstrate eyehand coordination I
[1:54:29] was able to show that I could actually
[1:54:32] do it even though that I could see with
[1:54:34] my eyes at that time I was a blind shoe
[1:54:36] cobbler brothers and sisters I was not
[1:54:38] serving the Lord I was able to get a job
[1:54:40] and and with this job it was in a
[1:54:43] national franchise it was called Money's
[1:54:44] Worth and best. It was uh from Toronto
[1:54:46] to Vancouver all across the country. I
[1:54:49] think they had a hundred different
[1:54:50] outlets and
[1:54:52] uh you know th this type of shoe repair
[1:54:55] was so much different than the old old
[1:54:57] guy in the dim back room type of shoe
[1:55:00] repair. It was a very different thing
[1:55:02] and uh anyways I was able to learn it
[1:55:05] and and very well and and I progressed
[1:55:07] into a place where I was I became a
[1:55:09] managing partner of the South Center
[1:55:11] Mall outlet in Calgary. I worked there
[1:55:12] for about 12 years. And uh it's
[1:55:14] interesting because during this time
[1:55:17] they actually tried to get me to move to
[1:55:18] Edmonton to take on the West Edmonton
[1:55:20] Mall store. There was a shop in the West
[1:55:22] Edmonton Mall and they took me out for a
[1:55:24] weekend and showed me a good time and
[1:55:26] tried to get me to move. And even in the
[1:55:28] world as a kid, I was like, I just don't
[1:55:30] like Edmonton. I can't do it, man. No.
[1:55:34] So, I didn't. And uh they said to me,
[1:55:36] you know, because of that, we don't have
[1:55:38] any work for you. You can uh choose what
[1:55:40] you want to do. He was trying to
[1:55:41] strongarm me with it in the shoe repair
[1:55:43] industry. And I said, you know,
[1:55:45] whatever, man. I got a life to live. See
[1:55:46] you. And I just left. I went and did a
[1:55:49] few other jobs. And then I he said, "If
[1:55:51] you ever change your mind, just call
[1:55:53] me." And so in the end, I I changed my
[1:55:56] mind and I called him and I went back
[1:55:58] and and wound up working with him for a
[1:56:00] long time. Uh we had about 12 or 13
[1:56:04] years of of work together. And I I just
[1:56:06] came to the place where I got tired of
[1:56:07] working retail hours. And you know, it
[1:56:10] was every holiday, it was every weekend,
[1:56:12] and every evening. And if you ever uh
[1:56:15] consider shoe repair in in sort of the
[1:56:18] age in which we live in, I mean, it's a
[1:56:19] lot different now than it was um 20
[1:56:22] years ago, but uh trying to find someone
[1:56:26] who knows how to fix shoes and is
[1:56:27] reliable is a very difficult thing. Very
[1:56:30] difficult thing. So what would happen is
[1:56:32] as the managing partner it would be my
[1:56:35] responsibility the buck stop with me to
[1:56:36] make sure those doors were open in the
[1:56:39] mall. You couldn't just not open the
[1:56:40] doors in a mall. You have to open at a
[1:56:43] certain time and you have to close at a
[1:56:45] certain time. So I just got fed up with
[1:56:48] working those hours. And uh along the
[1:56:52] way, the power of influence. I had
[1:56:55] pulled up my socks by then and I was
[1:56:57] working really hard and not really
[1:56:59] hanging out with the other people that I
[1:57:01] was. They were busy doing their thing
[1:57:03] and I was busy doing mine. I realized
[1:57:05] that I wanted a house. I wanted security
[1:57:09] and and I wanted to be my own boss. I
[1:57:12] wanted to be the master of my own
[1:57:14] destiny. And so I was busy working on
[1:57:17] getting a house. And I was able to do
[1:57:19] that while I was being a shoe maker. And
[1:57:23] you know, under the power of influence,
[1:57:25] I wound up working with a guy who was a
[1:57:27] shoe maker. And uh he was an alcoholic.
[1:57:31] And I didn't really worry about anything
[1:57:34] because I had my own problems and saw
[1:57:36] the way um these people lived their
[1:57:39] lives. I had been around a lot of
[1:57:41] alcoholics and it never really affected
[1:57:42] me. And there was all kinds of other
[1:57:44] stuff going on. And what happened was by
[1:57:48] by the reason of influence, the power of
[1:57:51] influence, hanging out with this guy,
[1:57:53] this character, I wound up drinking
[1:57:55] myself. I started down that road of
[1:57:57] drinking. And uh what happened was I
[1:58:00] became a functioning alcoholic. I would
[1:58:02] go to work and uh when I was done work,
[1:58:05] then I would go to drinking and once I
[1:58:08] was done to drinking, I would go to
[1:58:10] sleep and get up somehow, I guess, by
[1:58:14] the grace of God. and and stumble to
[1:58:16] work and work all day and just continue
[1:58:18] that cycle. It was bad. It wasn't
[1:58:20] good. Through the process of time, I
[1:58:23] wound up quitting that job as a
[1:58:24] shoemaker and I wound up getting a job
[1:58:26] at a home builder. And uh I started out
[1:58:29] as a as a junior laborer because that
[1:58:32] was all that I could do. I didn't have
[1:58:34] credentials to be uh anybody else. So
[1:58:38] that's where I found myself as a junior
[1:58:39] laborer. And uh I was probably about 28
[1:58:43] years old when I did
[1:58:44] that. And I worked my way through the
[1:58:47] company into a position of service and
[1:58:50] warranty after a few years. And by this
[1:58:53] time I had a house of my own and I had
[1:58:55] done some renovations in it. So I was
[1:58:57] quite familiar you know with the ins and
[1:58:59] outs of houses and you know basic
[1:59:01] construction. And all the while I was
[1:59:04] consuming alcohol like crazy. And uh one
[1:59:07] of the things I discovered working for
[1:59:08] the homebuilder was they liked alcohol
[1:59:10] too. So it was almost kindred spirits.
[1:59:13] There was, you know, party celebrations.
[1:59:14] They always had an open bar. It was just
[1:59:17] it was awful. But it was uh it was
[1:59:20] convenient for me in my situation. And
[1:59:22] it was the grace of God that I was able
[1:59:24] to hold down the job during the week.
[1:59:26] But uh you know, evenings and weekends
[1:59:29] were just a wreck for me. And working
[1:59:32] here, I I had worked with many different
[1:59:34] companies as as a home builder. If
[1:59:36] anybody I know a few of us here have
[1:59:38] built new homes, you understand what it
[1:59:40] means to have deficiencies, a deficiency
[1:59:43] list. I was the guy that actually
[1:59:45] facilitated fixing all the deficiencies
[1:59:47] in every single house in the area in
[1:59:49] which I worked. And uh there was this
[1:59:52] one company in particular. It was our
[1:59:54] kitchen supplier where there was someone
[1:59:57] in the service department there that
[1:59:59] really stood out to me. There was two
[2:00:00] service coordinators there, but there
[2:00:02] was one that just really seemed to make
[2:00:04] it easy to do our job. And uh you know,
[2:00:08] the the other one was was pretty good,
[2:00:10] but but but the one that I'm talking
[2:00:12] about was absolutely
[2:00:13] spectacular. It made it so easy for me
[2:00:16] to get things done. And and she really
[2:00:19] stood out to me. I was like, how is it
[2:00:21] that someone can be so good at what they
[2:00:24] do and and make it so easy when everyone
[2:00:27] else doesn't seem to be able to? there
[2:00:29] was something different there anyways
[2:00:31] and uh so she was currently doing so
[2:00:34] well in her position in the company that
[2:00:35] they wanted to move her into another
[2:00:36] department and she didn't want to do it
[2:00:39] but she wound up doing it because she
[2:00:40] had no choice and uh that meant that we
[2:00:44] would lose contact now we weren't even
[2:00:46] friends really we just worked together
[2:00:49] and whenever I needed something for the
[2:00:50] kitchen company I would call and hope
[2:00:52] that I would get her because it was
[2:00:54] friendly it was immediate it just worked
[2:00:58] And uh so one time she told me that she
[2:01:01] was moving on to a different department
[2:01:02] and I said, "Well, you know,
[2:01:04] farewell, have a nice day. I wish you
[2:01:07] well." And carried on with life. I
[2:01:10] wasn't really, you know, it's the way
[2:01:12] things go. I understood that. I wasn't
[2:01:14] looking for anything. And uh I was
[2:01:16] certainly thankful that I I had the time
[2:01:19] that I did. We were able to get things
[2:01:20] done together. It was wonderful. And I
[2:01:22] was at a place in my life, just to be
[2:01:24] clear, where I wasn't interested in
[2:01:26] settling down with any woman. I had come
[2:01:28] from a position in my life where
[2:01:30] divorce, my dad had uh, you know, broken
[2:01:33] marriages, and it's just the way it
[2:01:35] worked out there. Uh, I don't fault him
[2:01:37] for it. He's a human, as I said. Um, I
[2:01:41] hung out with people who were the
[2:01:44] unsaavory ones where that was sort of
[2:01:46] the mainstay there. There was a a place
[2:01:49] where people just don't even believe in
[2:01:51] marriage. They just shack up together
[2:01:53] and it's just terrible having children
[2:01:56] and the people that did get married,
[2:01:58] they would divorce and I was just wasn't
[2:02:00] getting married. Not going to do it at
[2:02:01] all. I'm going to have a house. I'm
[2:02:02] going to be the master of my own
[2:02:03] destiny. Nobody's going to divorce me
[2:02:06] and take half my house and and on and on
[2:02:08] and on. That's not going to happen. I I
[2:02:11] did it differently. And uh so anyways, I
[2:02:13] was at a place in my life where I was
[2:02:14] quite content that way. I wasn't
[2:02:16] interested in settling down with
[2:02:17] anybody. And and it was just the way it
[2:02:21] was for me. All in the midst of it, I
[2:02:24] was hungering and thirsting for
[2:02:26] righteousness. And and there was
[2:02:28] something in my life that I was really
[2:02:30] thirsting for. If you ever listen to the
[2:02:32] message thirst, brother Brandham talks
[2:02:35] about it. The human being has been
[2:02:37] created to thirst. Amen. We have been
[2:02:40] created to crave the spirit of God. And
[2:02:45] you know what the devil has done? Has
[2:02:48] perverted the avenues to feed that
[2:02:51] craving. He's come out with alcohol.
[2:02:54] He's come out with entertainment. He's
[2:02:55] come out with music. He's come out with
[2:02:57] movies. He's come out with all manner of
[2:03:00] distraction to try and keep people busy
[2:03:03] enough with all these things to miss out
[2:03:06] on the true satisfaction of that thirst.
[2:03:10] Amen. Here I found myself hungering and
[2:03:13] thirsting so much. I was drinking so
[2:03:15] hard, thirsting for it so much through
[2:03:18] my whole life. I desired God, but had no
[2:03:20] idea where to find him and and and
[2:03:23] didn't want to find myself getting
[2:03:26] connected with some denomination or some
[2:03:28] cult. You hear about all the different
[2:03:30] things in the news and as I grew up, I
[2:03:32] saw all the weird people and the and the
[2:03:34] TV evangelists and you hear about the
[2:03:36] ones who get caught sinning and all they
[2:03:39] do is want your money and on and on. We
[2:03:42] all know about all this. And so as a as
[2:03:44] a call it a backsliden Christian, I
[2:03:47] desired God but couldn't find him. He
[2:03:50] just wasn't anywhere that I could see. I
[2:03:52] just went my own way and tried to make
[2:03:54] it the best I could. And I was afraid to
[2:03:56] get connected with the wrong thing
[2:03:59] because of what could happen. So alls I
[2:04:01] did was carry on. It was because of the
[2:04:04] pain I suffered. I felt like God, he
[2:04:06] didn't really care for me about where I
[2:04:09] was. So why would I bother really trying
[2:04:11] to go after God in any avenue, in any
[2:04:14] way, shape, or form? And you know what
[2:04:16] that is? That's the devil's lie. That's
[2:04:19] the lie of the devil for us to think
[2:04:20] that God doesn't care.
[2:04:23] And you know it just came to me as I was
[2:04:25] as I was preparing these notes. It was a
[2:04:28] superficial justification for
[2:04:32] sinning. It gave me the ability to say
[2:04:36] because he did or didn't then I can. And
[2:04:39] what a lie. Such a terrible place to
[2:04:42] find yourself. I found myself to be a
[2:04:46] drunk. I found myself alone and not
[2:04:50] knowing how to ever find God.
[2:04:53] And you know, brothers and sisters, I'm
[2:04:54] not joking about that. I found myself a
[2:04:56] drunk. I would I would consume way too
[2:05:00] much alcohol to the place where my
[2:05:02] stomach would reject
[2:05:04] it. And I was at the place in my life
[2:05:06] where I I felt like then I was satisfied
[2:05:10] for some twisted reason. That's the way
[2:05:12] the devil gets us, isn't it? We get
[2:05:14] sprayed with his DDT and then we find
[2:05:16] ourselves in some strange realm of
[2:05:19] existence which is so far from the way a
[2:05:22] son and daughter of God should live. But
[2:05:25] that's the way I was living. I was I was
[2:05:27] drinking alcohol at night until I would
[2:05:29] get sick and then I would say I've had
[2:05:31] enough. What a terrible place to be.
[2:05:33] That's where I found myself. It was my
[2:05:36] thirst. It was my desire for God though
[2:05:39] that was happening in my life. And the
[2:05:41] devil is just trying to put anything he
[2:05:43] could in my front of my path. Banana
[2:05:45] peels I talk about. So I found myself to
[2:05:47] be a drunk alone and not knowing how to
[2:05:50] ever really make it right or get back.
[2:05:52] And you know what did it? It was that
[2:05:55] initial time where I started to listen
[2:05:57] to rock and roll. Way back when I was
[2:06:00] little, it was that initial time where
[2:06:02] my dad said, "Don't do that." And I knew
[2:06:05] that he said, "Don't do that." But I did
[2:06:07] that when he said don't hang out with
[2:06:09] that kid. I don't want you to see you go
[2:06:11] and and spend time with that child.
[2:06:13] Don't do that. And what did I do? I did
[2:06:16] that. Every time we start to step over
[2:06:18] those flags in our lives, what happens
[2:06:21] is that voice grows dimmer and dimmer
[2:06:24] and dimmer until we find ourselves in a
[2:06:27] position where we're a drunk and we're
[2:06:29] alone. Where we're an addict, maybe on a
[2:06:31] street somewhere, maybe we're in a bar.
[2:06:34] Maybe we find ourselves in jail. You
[2:06:36] know what? The devil doesn't care how
[2:06:37] far down we go. He wants to take us all
[2:06:39] the way to the grave.
[2:06:43] And it all starts with the facade. Let's
[2:06:46] go party. Let's go have fun. It's fun.
[2:06:51] It's exciting. It's not fun and
[2:06:53] exciting, brothers and sisters. It's the
[2:06:54] path to destruction.
[2:06:57] I'm telling you by experience.
[2:07:00] So, I tried moving away at this point. I
[2:07:03] sold my house. I said, "Man, I got to do
[2:07:04] something drastic. I got to get away
[2:07:06] from these people." the the neighbors
[2:07:08] that I lived beside, the people in the
[2:07:10] area, we we all drank together. There
[2:07:12] was this this this call it a club and
[2:07:15] and I just had to get out of there. So,
[2:07:17] we sold the house. I sold it. I found
[2:07:20] myself living in a basement suite. I was
[2:07:22] building a new house with the home
[2:07:23] builder that I was working for. And and
[2:07:26] I was still a drunk. Even though I moved
[2:07:28] away from all the friends, I still had
[2:07:30] the drinking with me. I still had the
[2:07:32] desire. And you know what happened is it
[2:07:34] grew stronger. The more that I tried to
[2:07:36] do something on my own, the worse it
[2:07:39] got. And I didn't know how to change
[2:07:41] things in my
[2:07:43] life. You know, one afternoon while I
[2:07:45] was working, I started to feel sick. And
[2:07:48] and after a day or so of not getting
[2:07:51] well, I went to the hospital. I just
[2:07:54] went to the hospital. I just paused my
[2:07:56] appointments and I drove myself to the
[2:07:58] hospital and I found out that I had
[2:07:59] appendicitis and they scheduled me for a
[2:08:01] surgery.
[2:08:03] And little did I know that this would be
[2:08:05] the door that God used to open the way
[2:08:09] back to him.
[2:08:11] While I was in the hospital recovering
[2:08:13] from surgery, this service coordinator
[2:08:16] that I had respected, but I didn't know
[2:08:19] well. I had only met her one time for
[2:08:21] not even five minutes, she turned up at
[2:08:24] the
[2:08:25] hospital. And I I was shocked. While I
[2:08:29] was in the hospital, I had no alcohol
[2:08:32] for three days. I had no cigarettes for
[2:08:34] three days. I had no marijuana for three
[2:08:38] days. I I had no influence of friends
[2:08:41] for three days. All I did was sit and
[2:08:44] watch a beacon of light
[2:08:46] spin in the night. If you've ever
[2:08:49] experienced it where you just can't
[2:08:50] sleep, that's what I was doing in the
[2:08:52] hospital. I was watching this cell tower
[2:08:54] and this light would just spin. And and
[2:08:55] I remember thinking, you know, in my
[2:08:58] life, what is my life going to amount
[2:09:00] to? My my grandmother, God rest her
[2:09:03] soul, she was a Pentecostal Christian.
[2:09:06] Am I ever going to see her again? She
[2:09:08] was the one who who was always the same.
[2:09:11] She never really changed in her life and
[2:09:13] and the religion that she believed and
[2:09:15] everything having to do with God, she
[2:09:18] just sort of stayed the same. And she
[2:09:19] kind of reminds me that that cell tower
[2:09:22] out there, that light kind of reminds
[2:09:23] me, that beacon that just continually
[2:09:25] does it exactly the same. Is there any
[2:09:27] hope for me to see her again in my life?
[2:09:31] And I remember vividly thinking, "Nope,
[2:09:33] not in this condition. I don't know how
[2:09:35] on earth I'm going to be able to do it."
[2:09:37] And the next day, like the third day I
[2:09:40] was in there, maybe it wasn't the next
[2:09:42] day exactly, this service coordinator
[2:09:44] turns up and I'm like, "H how are you
[2:09:48] here?" like, "What are you doing? What's
[2:09:51] this?" And I didn't know what was going
[2:09:53] on at that
[2:09:55] time, but I had respect for her because
[2:09:58] everybody told me she's a
[2:09:59] Christian. Don't you swear or she'll
[2:10:02] hang up the phone. And we've talked
[2:10:03] about this in the past, but maybe some
[2:10:05] people don't know. This is the testimony
[2:10:07] of how I met my
[2:10:09] wife. She came to visit me in the
[2:10:11] hospital and she witnessed to me. I I
[2:10:14] had been in there for a while without
[2:10:16] all this influence in my life and and
[2:10:21] reflecting and wondered where am I going
[2:10:23] to go? Am I ever going to see grandma
[2:10:24] again? What's going to be the outcome of
[2:10:26] my life? What will people say about
[2:10:28] me? And this one person who was a
[2:10:32] representation of Christianity that I
[2:10:35] had seen in modern history in my life,
[2:10:37] she came
[2:10:38] in and you know she didn't preach to me
[2:10:40] or have a lot of theological discussion.
[2:10:43] She just simply said to me, "Come and
[2:10:46] see." Cuz I asked her, we actually went
[2:10:49] from the the area where the pay phone
[2:10:51] was when she came in and I saw her and
[2:10:53] we went to the lounge and sat down in
[2:10:55] the hospital ward. We're sitting there
[2:10:57] and I said to her, "What tell me about
[2:10:58] your church? Tell me about you. What is
[2:11:01] it about you? Cuz there's I I see a
[2:11:04] light about you when I talk to you on
[2:11:07] the phone. There's something different
[2:11:10] about you. What is it?"
[2:11:13] and she just said, "You know, come and
[2:11:15] see. I could give you a book or
[2:11:17] something. I could tell you about it
[2:11:18] when you get out of the hospital." And
[2:11:19] right when we're having this
[2:11:20] conversation, three of the drinking
[2:11:22] buddies walk
[2:11:23] in right in front of her, right in front
[2:11:26] of me. And I'm like, "Oh my goodness,
[2:11:28] this good Christian girl is here in
[2:11:31] front of me." And I'm finally trying to
[2:11:32] get some answers about the clarity
[2:11:34] moment that I'm having. And and now this
[2:11:37] this representation. And it was
[2:11:40] interesting for me because
[2:11:42] really, brother Brandham says it,
[2:11:44] doesn't he? Show me your people and I'll
[2:11:46] tell you who you
[2:11:48] are. My people just came in. And and I
[2:11:51] was like, "Oh my goodness, that's how I
[2:11:52] am."
[2:11:56] Oh.
[2:11:58] So through the process of time, I got
[2:12:00] out of the hospital and I didn't
[2:12:02] immediately come to church. Why not?
[2:12:05] Because it was so easy to go back to the
[2:12:06] old ways of life. This old man don't
[2:12:08] like dying. Are we okay for time,
[2:12:11] brothers and sisters?
[2:12:13] Amen.
[2:12:15] This old man didn't want to
[2:12:17] die. The service coordinator at the
[2:12:19] kitchen
[2:12:20] company, she had moved on to another
[2:12:23] position and we lost
[2:12:25] contact and there was no relationship
[2:12:28] outside of work. So there was no reason
[2:12:30] to be in touch.
[2:12:33] And our conversation in the hospital had
[2:12:36] sparked an interest in me, but that pull
[2:12:39] of the old life was just way too strong.
[2:12:42] And it's interesting because I had
[2:12:43] gotten rid of most of my old friends. I
[2:12:46] had gotten rid of most of my old ways. I
[2:12:48] wasn't going and associating to the
[2:12:50] places that I used to. I was doing my
[2:12:52] own thing, but I still had this this
[2:12:54] this devil was haunting me with
[2:12:57] alcohol. So here I found myself one day
[2:13:01] with my boss. We were sitting in the
[2:13:03] back office and and the company was just
[2:13:06] exploding. It was Morrison Homes for
[2:13:08] those people who are interested. There
[2:13:10] was 40 employees when I started working
[2:13:12] there and by the time we left there was
[2:13:14] 140 employees and we had a brand new big
[2:13:16] brand new office building in East Lake
[2:13:18] Industrial. But one day I was sitting in
[2:13:20] the back room of the warehouse because
[2:13:22] they had no more room for the service
[2:13:24] department in the office building. We
[2:13:27] were sitting back there drinking coffee
[2:13:28] before work. It was about 6:30 or 7 in
[2:13:30] the morning and and he just told me just
[2:13:32] off the cuff, we're hiring a new service
[2:13:34] coordinator in the office. And I was
[2:13:35] like, "Yeah, okay, that's great. Cool.
[2:13:37] We could use it. We're getting real busy
[2:13:39] and we need more help." And he said,
[2:13:41] "Here's the applications. Why don't you
[2:13:43] look through them? Tell me what you
[2:13:44] think." And I was like, "Wow." Okay. So,
[2:13:46] I looked through them and there was one
[2:13:47] that caught my eye in there and and it
[2:13:49] looked like this one woman from the
[2:13:51] kitchen place. I was like, "Is that is
[2:13:53] that her? Like, is that the one?" And he
[2:13:55] said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?" And I
[2:13:57] said, "Throw the rest in the garbage and
[2:13:59] hire
[2:14:00] her. Hire that one." And you know,
[2:14:03] brothers and sisters, it wasn't because
[2:14:04] I I knew her. It wasn't because we hung
[2:14:07] out and were friends. There was I never
[2:14:10] come to church. I'd never really heard
[2:14:12] her even witness to me other than coming
[2:14:14] to the hospital the one time to say,
[2:14:16] "You know what? There is a living God."
[2:14:18] That was
[2:14:19] all. But she did her job. That's right.
[2:14:22] There's one thing that I want to say
[2:14:24] about her in her position as a
[2:14:26] Christian. She was not lazy.
[2:14:29] She wasn't stealing from her boss by
[2:14:32] going and doing other things when she
[2:14:33] should be working for the salary that
[2:14:35] she was given. She was actually on it
[2:14:39] with every single thing. So much so, she
[2:14:42] completely cleaned up the service
[2:14:43] department. They're like, "Wow, if
[2:14:45] you're that good, we want you to move
[2:14:46] over to the renovation department
[2:14:48] because that's messy."
[2:14:50] And if you've ever done renovations,
[2:14:51] it's
[2:14:52] messy. But anyways, so he says, "Yeah,
[2:14:55] that's her." And you know what? So he he
[2:14:57] took me up on it. This was one time
[2:14:59] where he listened to me and he said,
[2:15:00] "Okay, that's fine." He brought her in
[2:15:04] and and this kind of sense of humor that
[2:15:06] he had. He said, "You know what? Since
[2:15:08] you actually suggested that we hire her,
[2:15:10] she's going to be your service
[2:15:11] coordinator. She's going to become your
[2:15:13] boss
[2:15:14] now. She can schedule your life for
[2:15:17] you." And I was like, "Okay, that'll be
[2:15:19] fine." because I know she's on it.
[2:15:20] Everything will work out. That'll be
[2:15:21] great. Perfect. I like it. And she came
[2:15:24] to work with us and uh it was just a
[2:15:26] wonderful time. And you know, she began
[2:15:29] to witness to me. We we we interacted in
[2:15:32] the office and and we started to maybe
[2:15:35] become friends at work. Um there was
[2:15:38] zero hanging out. There was no
[2:15:40] communication other than what would
[2:15:42] happen in the normal course of work. And
[2:15:44] this woman that I worked with began
[2:15:46] inviting me to
[2:15:47] church. And I I she knew that I had a
[2:15:50] curiosity about it, but I just could not
[2:15:54] allow that old man to die. That old man
[2:15:56] just did not want to die. So, she would
[2:15:58] invite me to church and I would resist
[2:16:00] and invite me and I'd resist. And, you
[2:16:02] know, eventually I gave in and and this
[2:16:06] is the way it worked out. She had called
[2:16:08] me because there was going to be some
[2:16:09] special services this one weekend in
[2:16:12] 2005. And uh she called me and and and I
[2:16:16] didn't pick up because I I was on my way
[2:16:17] out to Oktokes where my new house was
[2:16:19] being built. My first house. This is
[2:16:21] while I was living in the basement
[2:16:22] suite. And and and I thought, you know,
[2:16:24] I I don't want to go to church this
[2:16:27] weekend. I'm going to go look at my my
[2:16:29] house. I'm going to go and get some beer
[2:16:30] and go and do my thing. And you know,
[2:16:33] she's just going to invite me to church
[2:16:34] anyways. And so I didn't answer the
[2:16:36] phone. And and when the phone stopped
[2:16:38] ringing and I was driving along, I
[2:16:41] remember distinctly again hearing a
[2:16:42] voice in my heart, in my head, I don't
[2:16:45] know, in the van maybe, but but it said
[2:16:48] to me, "That just might be your last
[2:16:50] call." And if you've ever been to a bar
[2:16:52] with alcohol, you know, they do a last
[2:16:54] call at the end of the night. You know,
[2:16:55] you got to scramble to get another drink
[2:16:57] before they close. It's kind of the way
[2:16:59] it is. But I I remember distinctly not
[2:17:02] thinking about the bar and my last call
[2:17:04] on alcohol. What I was thinking about is
[2:17:06] that that donut-shaped thing that's tied
[2:17:08] to a rope on a ship when you're drowning
[2:17:10] and they throw it to you. That's what I
[2:17:13] remember thinking about vividly. That
[2:17:14] just might be my last call. My last
[2:17:17] opportunity to be saved from drowning.
[2:17:20] And I thought, man, this is weird. I
[2:17:22] don't know what to say. I guess I'll
[2:17:24] call her back. And so I called her back
[2:17:26] and she laughed and said, you know, I
[2:17:28] guess you uh you thought I was going to
[2:17:30] invite you to church again, right? I
[2:17:32] said, well, I don't know. and she said,
[2:17:34] "I wasn't going to call you and invite
[2:17:35] you to church because I know you're not
[2:17:37] going to come. But what I wanted to do
[2:17:38] was invite you to a barbecue. I wanted
[2:17:40] to invite you to a gathering." And so I
[2:17:42] thought, you know, that's that's cool. I
[2:17:44] could do that. Might not be so so so
[2:17:49] preachy. So I thought, you know, okay,
[2:17:51] that's fine. And uh it was it was a real
[2:17:54] nice evening. I went to a a fellowship.
[2:17:56] I think it might have been a potluck
[2:17:58] even, which is a a tremendous thing. And
[2:18:01] you know, I I just can't help but think
[2:18:03] this was actually my first service. The
[2:18:05] first church service that I went to was
[2:18:07] actually a fellowship. And some people
[2:18:09] might say, "Brother Barry, that's not
[2:18:10] possible." But I want to say it this
[2:18:11] way, brothers and sisters. We live Jesus
[2:18:14] Christ.
[2:18:16] We are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:18] Amen. The lives that we live represent
[2:18:21] Jesus Christ. Or they don't. There's no
[2:18:25] middle ground here. That's right. So
[2:18:28] getting together with the believers, it
[2:18:29] really did something for me. It showed
[2:18:31] me something that there is actually a
[2:18:33] life. These people, they're not
[2:18:35] salivating to get my email so that they
[2:18:38] can get me to tithe and and get their
[2:18:40] claws into me. No, no, no. That wasn't
[2:18:42] it at all. They were really kind people.
[2:18:44] And I I thought this is really nice. So
[2:18:47] I enjoyed the evening there. We had such
[2:18:49] a wonderful time. That was at the
[2:18:51] Fulkerson's acreage, their first acreage
[2:18:53] out southwest of Calgary here. And you
[2:18:56] know, it was just a wonderful time, the
[2:18:57] evening. And there was this guy sitting
[2:18:59] around the fire. I've told this story
[2:19:00] many times. It was brother Aaron McGiri
[2:19:02] and he's from Texas where it's really
[2:19:04] hot and he was here in Calgary where it
[2:19:06] was really cool. It was in July. He was
[2:19:10] wearing a hoodie and he was wearing
[2:19:11] baggy jeans. He had his hood up. Um, and
[2:19:14] so I thought, you know, there's no
[2:19:15] pressure sitting beside this guy. He
[2:19:17] looks like my kind of people, motocross,
[2:19:19] snowboarders. And I sat down beside him.
[2:19:22] And his first words, I made it the whole
[2:19:23] night. It was safe the whole night.
[2:19:24] Nobody preached to me at all. We just
[2:19:26] had a tremendous buffet of food. And if
[2:19:29] you ever have been to Sister Joannne's
[2:19:31] house for ice cream, the dessert is
[2:19:35] phenomenal. We had a wonderful evening.
[2:19:37] And uh anyways, sitting beside brother
[2:19:40] Aaron Mciri, he says to me, "So, what
[2:19:41] church do you go to?" And I'm like, "Oh,
[2:19:44] here we go." So, I took the time. I
[2:19:46] said, "You know, we got nowhere to go.
[2:19:48] I'm going to tell you what church I go
[2:19:49] to. I don't go to church. and the reason
[2:19:51] I don't go to church and and my parents
[2:19:53] and and the church and and and all these
[2:19:55] different things. And in the end, I
[2:19:57] summarize it all by saying they're
[2:19:58] hypocrites. It's it's hypocrisy. We go
[2:20:00] to church and we pretend to live Jesus
[2:20:02] Christ, but yet there's no power of God
[2:20:04] in the church. So why would I want
[2:20:06] anything to do with it? And he said,
[2:20:08] "Well, you know what? The way that
[2:20:09] you're judging all those people is
[2:20:12] causing you yourself to be a hypocrite
[2:20:15] because there couldn't be a false
[2:20:17] without their first being a true.
[2:20:20] And I was like,
[2:20:23] h maybe you got something
[2:20:26] there. So anyways, we just sort of
[2:20:29] brushed it off and carried on with the
[2:20:30] night. But you know what happened was
[2:20:32] the words that he spoke to me resonated
[2:20:34] in my heart. And those words from that
[2:20:37] church service sitting beside a campfire
[2:20:39] outside. It got me to church Wednesday.
[2:20:43] The very next Wednesday, I think that
[2:20:45] was a Sunday night or maybe even a
[2:20:47] Monday night. I can't remember exactly.
[2:20:49] You can look it up. July 27th, 2005. It
[2:20:52] got me to a Wednesday night
[2:20:55] service. And you know what what is
[2:20:57] interesting is uh it got me to that
[2:21:01] service, the first church
[2:21:03] service. And and it gave me the ability
[2:21:07] to to not have fear to go by actually
[2:21:10] just getting together and fellowshipping
[2:21:11] with the believers. It was wonderful. My
[2:21:13] my experience at the fellowship at that
[2:21:16] night, it caused me to try. Now, it
[2:21:19] could easily have gone the other way had
[2:21:21] somebody said, "What church do you go
[2:21:23] to?" "Well, why don't you go to church?
[2:21:24] How could you behave that way? Don't you
[2:21:26] know that that's sinning? Don't you know
[2:21:28] you're a sinner? Someone could have just
[2:21:30] started giving me God sent a prophet and
[2:21:32] we are are here to tell you that you
[2:21:35] need to repent." And and they could have
[2:21:37] done all that, right? What would that
[2:21:39] have done? I would have been like,
[2:21:42] "Right. See, I knew it. I knew it. But
[2:21:46] instead it was love.
[2:21:49] Everyone there exuded love to me and
[2:21:51] showed me that there was a better way to
[2:21:53] live. And and I was like man and you
[2:21:56] know honestly I don't think anyone was
[2:21:58] pretending there except for one guy. He
[2:22:01] made a joke. He cracked a joke at the
[2:22:02] very beginning which wasn't good. But
[2:22:05] aside from that everyone else they were
[2:22:08] just living their life. They were just
[2:22:09] being who they were. Doves are just
[2:22:11] doves. Sheep are just sheep. We just are
[2:22:14] who we are. But that caused me that
[2:22:18] experience to come to church. I desired
[2:22:21] to see what this was all about. So July
[2:22:23] 27th, 2005, I came to service in the
[2:22:25] upper room. I heard the preaching. I
[2:22:27] couldn't understand it, but something
[2:22:29] inside of me said, "That ain't nothing
[2:22:31] but the truth. This is truth. There's
[2:22:34] truth here in this building." And you
[2:22:36] know, I said in my heart, God, I want
[2:22:38] you to know that I need to know you are
[2:22:41] real. If you are God, then be my God.
[2:22:45] Amen. This is my testimony. And I'll
[2:22:48] tell you what, brothers and sisters, he
[2:22:50] answered my prayer. He showed me that
[2:22:52] he's God. And he became my God that
[2:22:55] night, that moment. And I said to him, I
[2:22:59] surrender all that I am to you right
[2:23:02] now. This was all in my heart, in my
[2:23:03] head. I surrender all that I am to you
[2:23:06] right now. There's nothing in my life
[2:23:08] that I reserve. I don't reserve any hurt
[2:23:10] that happened to me when I was a child.
[2:23:13] I don't reserve any emotions or
[2:23:15] feelings. I don't reserve any
[2:23:17] resentment. I invite you to come inside
[2:23:20] of me and take complete control of my
[2:23:23] life. Wash me by the water of your word.
[2:23:27] That was my prayer and he answered it.
[2:23:31] Skeptically, brothers and sisters, I
[2:23:33] came. Remember, I was a raging alcoholic
[2:23:35] at the time. I smoked a pack a day of
[2:23:38] cigarettes. I drank until I got sick. I
[2:23:41] didn't know where to go. I was thinking
[2:23:43] maybe a 12step program would help me.
[2:23:45] Maybe I could go to some program where I
[2:23:48] could live in it and and somehow they
[2:23:50] would be able to stretch me out and let
[2:23:52] me not live with it and somehow I would
[2:23:54] come out a better person. One service,
[2:23:58] complete surrender,
[2:24:01] delivered me from all of the effects of
[2:24:03] my past. Amen. Amen. And you know, it
[2:24:07] took me years to even recognize the
[2:24:09] power of that testimony. It took me
[2:24:12] years to recognize that. I didn't even
[2:24:13] realize it. But what happened, brothers
[2:24:16] and sisters, in that moment, because I
[2:24:19] fully surrendered personally. This is my
[2:24:21] opinion. I believe that God gave me the
[2:24:23] Holy Ghost right there. Amen. When I was
[2:24:26] 14 years old, he took me right back to
[2:24:28] where I left off with him. And you know
[2:24:30] what? It's exactly with what the prophet
[2:24:32] said. He doesn't leave us. We leave him
[2:24:35] and all we've got to do is get back to
[2:24:37] where we got off.
[2:24:39] My genuine desire was to get the Holy
[2:24:42] Ghost in my life. Oh my. Many years
[2:24:45] later, he gave it to me. I'll call the
[2:24:50] musicians. You know, I realized that
[2:24:52] there was another baptism because of it.
[2:24:55] I didn't realize that I got the Holy
[2:24:58] Ghost in that moment. Some people might
[2:25:00] dispute it and that's okay. You can. In
[2:25:02] the Bible, people got the Holy Ghost
[2:25:04] without water.
[2:25:07] But what happened to them afterwards?
[2:25:09] They when they got the Holy Ghost. When
[2:25:11] they got the Holy Ghost, they came in
[2:25:13] line with the word.
[2:25:15] They didn't say, "I got the Holy Ghost.
[2:25:17] I don't need to be baptized. I've
[2:25:18] already been baptized in titles." No,
[2:25:19] no, no, no, no. They came in accordance
[2:25:21] to Acts 2:38. They said, "I know that
[2:25:24] who the Holy Ghost is is alive in me,
[2:25:27] and I will never ever deny the word."
[2:25:30] Amen.
[2:25:31] And I realized there was another
[2:25:32] baptism. So I said,
[2:25:35] "Hey, I want to line up with that word."
[2:25:38] So, you know, I I was so thankful. We
[2:25:40] were talking about this just recently. I
[2:25:41] couldn't remember exactly when it was.
[2:25:43] And Sister Shelley helped me with this.
[2:25:45] It was in September 8th, 2005. I got
[2:25:49] rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:25:52] Christ. Amen. For the remission of my
[2:25:54] sins. Brother Ken baptized me and
[2:25:58] Brother Logan. And that's uh the late
[2:26:01] pastor here, Sister Shelley's husband,
[2:26:03] Brother Ken. Maybe stand with me as we
[2:26:05] close today, brothers and sisters. I
[2:26:06] just want to read one quote, and I don't
[2:26:08] know if I sent it to you. I apologize if
[2:26:10] I didn't. It's
[2:26:14] 195345E
[2:26:16] witnesses. If you type in the search
[2:26:18] app, and that's right, comma
[2:26:25] 2. And that's
[2:26:31] right, brother Brandham says. And that's
[2:26:33] right, too,
[2:26:34] Christian. Be sure that down in your
[2:26:38] heart, God has separated you from the
[2:26:42] things of the world
[2:26:48] and made you a new
[2:26:52] creature. and then go tell people you're
[2:26:54] a
[2:26:56] Christian. Until that's happened, stay
[2:26:59] right at the altar and die till you're
[2:27:02] just as dead as you can
[2:27:05] be. All right. Die till you're so dead
[2:27:10] till you can
[2:27:12] even Well, that's right.
[2:27:14] Dead. He says, "You know, I think today
[2:27:18] we bury too many live
[2:27:22] people. You bury people after they're
[2:27:24] dead. Isn't that
[2:27:27] right?" He says, "Yes, sir. Listen,
[2:27:30] brother. A dead man won't argue with
[2:27:34] you." Now, you might say, "Oh, Brother
[2:27:37] Perry, you can definitely get into
[2:27:38] arguments with people." Listen to what
[2:27:40] the prophet says. Listen to what the
[2:27:42] Holy Ghost speaks to this generation
[2:27:45] through the prophet. He says, "Listen,
[2:27:47] brother. A dead man won't argue with
[2:27:50] you. You can say anything to him. You
[2:27:54] want
[2:27:55] to call him all kinds of
[2:27:57] names. He won't say a word.
[2:28:02] Why? He's dead.
[2:28:06] And a man that's dead in Christ, you can
[2:28:09] offer him a
[2:28:11] drink, you can give him this, that, or
[2:28:14] the other, but he's dead.
[2:28:17] Hallelujah. And he's hid in
[2:28:20] Christ through God, sealed by the Holy
[2:28:25] Spirit. Amen. He says, "That's it." Now
[2:28:27] then, he can't do those
[2:28:30] things because he just can't do it. It's
[2:28:33] against his nature.
[2:28:36] He becomes a new creature.
[2:28:41] He says, "You take an old hog and wash
[2:28:43] him up and scrub him up and manicure his
[2:28:47] toenails and give it lipstick and put it
[2:28:51] on all the nylons. You want
[2:28:54] to turn it loose. It'll go right to a
[2:28:58] wallow and wallow.
[2:29:01] The scrubbing don't do no good. It's
[2:29:05] still got the nature of a hog. And when
[2:29:08] you take a lamb and put him in a mud
[2:29:11] hole, he'll squeal till you get him out.
[2:29:14] Why? He's the nature of a lamb.
[2:29:17] Now, the only way to keep the hog out of
[2:29:20] the mud is to change his nature. That's
[2:29:22] right.
[2:29:25] This is the Holy Ghost speaking through
[2:29:27] the prophet. Yes. That's the only way to
[2:29:30] make a
[2:29:31] Christian. Let his nature be changed.
[2:29:35] Brothers and sisters, let's let our
[2:29:38] nature be changed.
[2:29:41] Let the Holy Ghost inside of our lives
[2:29:43] just one time. We read this quote before
[2:29:45] Christmas. Just once, just try him and
[2:29:48] see what happens.
[2:29:50] He says, "That's the only way to make a
[2:29:52] Christian. Let his nature be changed
[2:29:54] from a sinner to a saint." You see, and
[2:29:56] there's only one remedy, and that's the
[2:29:58] Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2:30:01] Then you're a witness. Amen. Amen.
[2:30:05] You know, brothers and sisters, after a
[2:30:07] few months of attending service, coming
[2:30:10] to services on a Wednesday night
[2:30:14] pre-ervice, I can tell you, brothers and
[2:30:17] sisters, Wednesday services are some of
[2:30:19] the most powerful services that you will
[2:30:21] ever encounter in your life. They're
[2:30:24] some of the most powerful that I've ever
[2:30:26] encountered. If you can make Wednesday
[2:30:28] services, there's something special
[2:30:30] about
[2:30:31] them. But, you
[2:30:33] know, I heard the Holy Ghost say to me,
[2:30:36] "Why are you here?" I had my eyes
[2:30:39] closed, my head down. I was meditating
[2:30:41] with pre-ervice music going and I was
[2:30:44] just in the moment just thanking the
[2:30:46] Lord, praying to the Lord to search my
[2:30:48] heart and try me. Just allow me to come
[2:30:51] into this service with the right motive
[2:30:53] and objective. Let me not be dragging
[2:30:55] any sin. Let there be nothing in my
[2:30:57] life, Lord, to get in your way. And I
[2:30:59] hear a voice say to me, "Why are you
[2:31:01] here?" With my eyes closed, are you here
[2:31:04] for the girl or me? And I opened my eyes
[2:31:08] and I had to look around and say, "Who
[2:31:11] said
[2:31:12] that? Who said
[2:31:14] that?" I didn't speak the words, but I
[2:31:16] looked around and thought and there was
[2:31:18] nobody there. Nobody was talking. It was
[2:31:22] just quiet. The pre-ervice music. And it
[2:31:25] was in that moment that I had to
[2:31:28] realize that was God. That was God
[2:31:31] speaking to me sovereignly.
[2:31:34] And you know, brother Brandham says that
[2:31:35] he might only ever speak to a man one
[2:31:38] time in their life.
[2:31:40] My And I found him speaking to me. And I
[2:31:43] know in my heart, I said, "No, no, no.
[2:31:45] I'm not here for a girl. No, you know my
[2:31:47] heart, Lord. I'm here for you." If
[2:31:49] that's you talking, you hear my voice
[2:31:51] right now, my heart. I'm here for you
[2:31:53] and you
[2:31:54] alone. And you know what, brothers and
[2:31:56] sisters? If we put him first in our
[2:31:59] lives, seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[2:32:04] and then all these things shall be added
[2:32:07] unto you. I'm a witness. I'm a witness.
[2:32:09] Amen. Four children later, a beautiful
[2:32:12] wife, a wonderful family. It's all the
[2:32:15] Lord. The only way it comes is by full
[2:32:19] surrender.
[2:32:21] I want to say God bless you this
[2:32:22] morning. Thank you for listening. I pray
[2:32:24] that somehow someway it would be a
[2:32:26] blessing to someone. There is nothing
[2:32:28] glamorous about dealing with the world,
[2:32:30] about making ourselves fashioned in any
[2:32:33] way with the world. Brothers and
[2:32:35] sisters, it is the path to destruction.
[2:32:37] It will take you down. Trust in the Lord
[2:32:41] with all your heart. Lean not unto your
[2:32:43] own understanding and all your ways.
[2:32:45] Acknowledge him and he will direct your
[2:32:47] path. Listen to your parents. They won't
[2:32:50] do you wrong. Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:32:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:32:56] godly
[2:32:57] parents. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the
[2:32:59] leadership of your Holy Spirit. Oh,
[2:33:02] Father, I pray that Lord, you would just
[2:33:05] minister to the hearts, Father, that
[2:33:07] could be searching this morning. Father,
[2:33:09] maybe there's some that have things in
[2:33:11] their lives that don't seem to want to
[2:33:13] leave them. Father, maybe there's some
[2:33:16] that have never come to know you in the
[2:33:17] full power of the baptism of your Holy
[2:33:20] Spirit. Maybe there's some weward
[2:33:22] children. Oh, Father, maybe there's
[2:33:24] marriages. Lord, any of these problems
[2:33:27] are not too great for you, Lord. You are
[2:33:29] able, more than able to solve every
[2:33:31] single one of them. And they all stem to
[2:33:34] one avenue, and that is full surrender
[2:33:36] to you. Father, I pray that Lord, we
[2:33:40] would be able to surrender our lives
[2:33:41] completely unto you, Father. That we
[2:33:44] would be able to see the full
[2:33:45] manifestation of your life living out
[2:33:48] through us, Lord. Not trying to seek
[2:33:50] signs and wonders, but Lord, trying to
[2:33:52] seek the the liveless of your word,
[2:33:55] Father, that we could live our lives as
[2:33:57] a lively stone, Father, in the midst of
[2:34:00] a crooked and perverse generation, Lord
[2:34:03] Jesus. Father, I just pray that somehow
[2:34:06] someway the word spoken today would be
[2:34:08] for your glory. I'm so thankful, Lord
[2:34:11] Jesus, for what you've done for me.
[2:34:13] Lord, you make it so easy to worship
[2:34:15] you, Father. Lord, I don't have to look
[2:34:18] at the past. I don't have to look at the
[2:34:19] things that that I did in my life in the
[2:34:22] past, but I can look towards the prize
[2:34:24] for the high calling of God in Christ
[2:34:27] Jesus. Father, I pray that each and
[2:34:29] every one of us would desire that, Lord,
[2:34:31] to to press on, Father, not to fall
[2:34:34] backwards, Lord Jesus, or sideways, but
[2:34:37] Lord, to just go forwards in you and to
[2:34:39] allow you to have the preeminence that
[2:34:41] you desire in everything that we do,
[2:34:44] Lord. And if you can't be with us in
[2:34:46] everything that we do, then help us to
[2:34:48] stop those things that we don't want you
[2:34:51] to be a part of,
[2:34:53] Lord. Father, we love you and we thank
[2:34:55] you. We just commit each life into your
[2:34:57] hands now as we go our separate ways.
[2:34:59] Bless your children, Father. If it be
[2:35:01] your will for us to gather again on
[2:35:03] Wednesday, Father, we'll be careful to
[2:35:05] give you praise and honor and glory,
[2:35:07] Lord. You're so easy to worship, Father.
[2:35:10] We love you so much, Lord. Yes. Continue
[2:35:13] watching over your children. We pray in
[2:35:16] Jesus Christ's
[2:35:17] name. Amen. Amen.
[2:35:22] God bless you today.
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:33] [Applause]
[2:35:37] Can we sing that chorus in the presence
[2:35:39] of
[2:35:40] Jehovah in the
[2:35:45] praise? There's nothing that can't be
[2:35:48] fixed by
[2:35:49] him of Jehovah.

[2:37:51] king. Can we sing that song? I don't
[2:37:53] know what the title of it is. I
[2:37:55] apologize. He walks with me and he talks
[2:37:57] with
[2:37:58] me and he tells me I'm his
[2:38:05] own. No.
[2:38:08] [Music]

[2:39:41] talks with
[2:39:43] me and he
[2:39:46] tells me I am his

[2:40:22] [Music]
[2:40:24] it? It's so
[2:40:27] sweet. The birds touch their
[2:40:35] singing and the me.
[2:40:41] All I need to
[2:40:46] be
[2:40:48] within my
[2:40:51] heart is
[2:40:58] ringing. And he
[2:41:02] walks with me. And he
[2:41:07] talks with me.
[2:41:11] And he
[2:41:12] tells me I am his

[2:41:43] I stayed in the garden with him.
[2:41:52] Though the
[2:41:55] night around me be
[2:42:02] falling, but he
[2:42:05] with me
[2:42:07] go through the

[2:43:05] can

[2:43:12] before service. Can we sing it again?
[2:43:14] 758. Sorry about that last one,
[2:43:17] brothers. Victory in Jesus. Amen.
[2:43:22] These two songs, they speak to my heart.
[2:43:25] These are the Christian songs that my
[2:43:28] grandmother used to sing all the time
[2:43:30] when you were in her
[2:43:32] house. I heard an old old
[2:43:37] story. How a savior came from glory.
[2:43:44] how he gave his
[2:43:46] life on
[2:43:49] Calvary to save a wretch like me. Amen.
[2:43:56] I heard about his
[2:44:00] groaning of his precious
[2:44:03] blood
[2:44:10] at my sins and I won the victory.
[2:44:14] Hallelujah.
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:44:17] Oh,
[2:44:19] victory in
