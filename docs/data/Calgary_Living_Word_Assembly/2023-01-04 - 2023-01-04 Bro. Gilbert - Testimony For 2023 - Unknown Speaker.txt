thank you musicians thank you God bless you Saints Happy New Year I feel a little bit nervous for taking the first service of the year I prefer the pastor taking the first service for the year so that at least he gives Direction for the other ministers to follow but now here it has fallen my Lord I don't know which side to go but I'm just trusting that uh God will come down and say something that will help you uh I was thinking now what what where do I go then I remembered people on 31st they gave testimonies and we enjoyed them so I'm also going to give now my testimony but if you feel comfortable and say that will be too personal then you can give it a different title because the Pastor said God's calls the said call for the year 2023. so God has set a call for 2023 so you can make that one to be your your subject but me I'll call it my personal testimony so I but uh I've borrowed from the subject we covered in late preach which we called God's covenant so for those who are Inlet preach please don't switch off and say with your right-handed please remember the inspiration is the same but the anointing is different foreign encourage me to preach so that at least we can see what God has for us this fast service of 2023 let's turn to our bypass Hebrews chapter 8. Hebrews chapter 8. amen good all the time okay from verse 8 for finding fold with them he sayeth behold the days come says the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I met with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my Covenant and I recorded them not says the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days says the Lord I'll put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I'll be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more in in that he saith a New Covenant he has met the first old now that which decayeth waxes old is ready to vanish away let us pray our most gracious father we call upon thy name because you told us to call and you will answer and you are not a man that you can lie your what is true your promises are yeah and amen so we believe as we call upon thee you are going to answer at the cries of our souls this after this evening Lord we want to commit the service in your hands father Lord Jesus we have seen you on many occasions we have called upon thee and you have always you have never failed us father you have always come down to speak to our hearts Lord Jesus even as our brother prayed earlier on May you do something as you did to those who came from a mouse when you opened their eyes and they knew you father Lord may you break the Word of Life unto us this evening so that we can know you better than we have known you before father I commit myself now in your hands just take hold of me Father take me take me away Lord Jesus so that you come down and speak to your children father there is nothing I can offer them Lord but you have something for them so Lord Jesus grass as they come hunkering and fasting to hear from you master may you honor the cries of their souls so that you speak to them Father bless the reading of the word as we commit it now in your hands for it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray you can take your seats sorry for keeping you standing okay what is a covenant a covenant is an agreement entered into by two or more parties and you cannot just enter into a covenant for nothing there must be something you want to achieve so when God enters into a covenant with man there must be something that he wants to achieve now people make different Covenants we have marriage covenant you can put in any other Covenant that you know of we don't have time to go into details but people make different Covenants and the prophet says in the orient times how they used to make a Covenants in the message Israel in Egypt but the Oriental custom was to kill a beast and stand in between this beast and then write out over here you find it in Leviticus and they write out their agreement and that agreement is stored into two over this dead beast and they take an oath over the dead Beast that if they break this Covenant May their body be as this dead beast and they give each one a piece and they send them away you can imagine you kill an animal you stand on this side and your partner stands on the other side and as you look at the dead animal you say if you fail to honor This Promise may you die the way this animal is dead and because people fear death people will honor that argument but we have advanced so much until nowadays we will sign but because you don't want to honor the agreement you say can you prove that actually this signature is mine why you don't want to fulfill the agreement but God is faithful when he makes an agreement he fulfills his part amen now we've had different Covenants there was adamic Covenant there was Noah's Covenant there was abrahamic Covenant now the prophet says adamic Covenant it failed why because God made an argument with man and any time God makes an agreement with man man will always fail his part I can prove it how many times have you met ackermans or covenants with God that I'll be being the first person to come to church and you find yourself the last person you've already broken the agreement oh this year I will do this you find yourself doing the opposite which means as long as you remain a man or a woman there is no way you are going to fulfill God's covenant you will always fail so in conclusion we can say for God to make an agreement that will be binding it has to be it has to be God making a covenant with God remember we are following my testimony so in a nutshell I'm saying for me to make a covenant with God I must become God anything short of that there is no way you are going to fulfill you are part of the agreement may God help us oh my now in the message called Covenant with Abraham paragraph E7 and I want you to notice that God said in here I will now when God as we were speaking last evening he met a covenant I joined Covenant with the children but with a fast fast parent the hidden Covenant it was conditional Covenant God when he spoke to Adam and the Blessed Adam he made a covenant between he and Adam if Adam would do a certain thing he would do a certain thing and then we find out that Adam broke his part of the promise so if you are going to remain a human being there is no way you are going to fulfill your part of the Covenant but God wants to make a covenant as we shall see may God help us are we following okay amen now when it came to Noah Noah's Covenant it also fails that is the prophet who says that so the prophet says Noah's Covenant Noah failed and that's why the scripture where we read the Bible says a new covenant why because the only one it failed but God doesn't want to fail so he had to make another Covenant and that's why he came now with abrahamic Covenant now how did abrahamic covenant not fail God had to take part of his name and joined it to Abram to make it Abraham so that now when he's making a covenant he's not making a covenant with Abram as a man he's making a covenant with God himself I love it laughs so that was Abraham that God had to take part of his name and join it to apram to make it Abraham so by that now he's not making a covenant with man but he's making a covenant with God and now because he was making a covenant with God that Covenant was eternal it could not fail may God help us remember he wants to make a covenant he wants to make a covenant with you and we say it okay by the way this is just a background of the sermon that is coming because I've been preparing it for quite some time so I just wanted this one to be an introduction so if you catch this one then when the other one comes you will say Amen or else I might remain by myself to say Amen oh yes so that was Opera now listen to this the prophet says in the message this day this day this scripture is fulfilled paragraph 235 not one time has the history Church of the world ever had an evangelist to go to it with a name ending ham until this day oh my so for Abraham God had to identify himself with apram before he could make a covenant with him now here the prophet is saying there has never been I'm evangelist with a name ending in harm but with seven letters Graham had six letters so we have Branham seven letters so we can say God has taken part of his name and joined it to this man so that now he can make a covenant with him now how do we become beneficiaries of that Covenant the scripture says he who receives a prophet in the name of the Prophet receives the prophet's reward I wonder how many people have received the prophet we he who receives the prophet for you to become a beneficiary of that Covenant then you must receive the prophet so if you have received the prophet William Marion pranham there is one thing to say you have received the prophet then there is another thing to live the life of the message that he brought so for you to say that you have received that message or for you to say you have received the prophet then you must live the life it is your life that will prove whether you have received the prophet may God help us oh my so far so good are you following my testimony may God help me to bring this testimony in the right way that people will get it but don't pick up quarrel with me it's my my it's my testimony so you can also make yours [Laughter] amen may may God help us I will not be long tonight being the first fast service of the year but if I stretch a little bit you bear with me because I remember my friend was was my my friend came where I was seated and then he was like why can't you say something I couldn't say something at that time because I knew I will have time to give my testimony so I have all the time but I'm following the thought of our pastor that God has said the calls for 2023. so we are following which is which is this core and thank you forever brother Paul you say that you sang that song he has called me and I've answered so I will follow all the way so you have to follow all the way until your character becomes God's character if I may go ahead of my someone let's read this scripture because this is going to be our our subject for today John chapter 10. John chapter 10. verse 30. it says I and my father are one I and my father are one when Jesus Christ said I and my father are one the Pharisees picked up quarrel oh so if you miss anything in our service tonight take that scripture that I and my father are one if you can come to that point my brother my sister where you can say I and my father are one even the Pharisees in our meetings will pick a quarter with you so that is the climax of our calling I and my father are one and that is all that God is looking for in our meetings for us to get to a point where you can say I and my father are one at that time the human element is not there at that time you are no longer a human being you will be seated here you can talk you can shake hands but you are not here when you come to a point where you can say I and my father are one so that is the set call for our 2023 Lord lead me until I come to a point where I can say I and my father are one it's gonna happen that's why we come for for the service so that he's we are work in progress so as we approach the year 2023 let that be your prayer I want to hit that Mark where I can say I and my father are one anything short of that you are just a church member foreign [Music] now we talked about that agreement that how the Chinese used to use to make covenants our agreements they could take a piece of paper you take your laundry then because they didn't know how to write so they just used to take a piece of paper and they tear that piece of paper so they give you your part and the other part remains in the in the cleaning or in the dry cleaning so when you come to claim your property you have to come with what you are given oh my I expected a very big amen you have to come with what you are given so they take what you are given they match it what with what remained in their laundry if it doesn't match you are told go away you are a pretender please don't don't pick a call with my testimony we are coming closer Home this is my inspiration for 2023 I want to come to a point where I can say I and my father are one okay oh my okay listen to this there in the message Israel in Egypt there God showed Abram what he was going to do that through the seed of Isaac he would bring forth his only begotten son Christ and was slain Yonder between the heavens and the Earth when the sun went down the Blackness over the Earth and there he tore his part God pulled his soul out of him and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth I hope we were part of that family okay when that precious and adulteriorated blood of the almighty God dribbling from Emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out of him he said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me his face full of mockery speed the crown of quail mockery pulled down over his his Pro his nails drove was Roman spikes his his back ribbon until his ribs shot through swinging on the cross screaming dying Cena's death the sin of the world upon him and there God rivaled his sights tore his soul out of him when he said into the enhance I commend my spirit and he dropped his head under the Earth Shook and Purge belched out its rocks there he is there God was making a covenant now paragraph 94 of the same message now here he comes don't Riven tour to Pieces his soul went to God God blessed him and then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up their mind clean up their heart live a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and when the Holy Ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus Christ out of the Grave will will rupture and that Covenant has to dovetail as he taught as he taught there and became the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth then your spirit will have to be the same kind of spirit or it will miss that place all together remember we said the Chinese they had to give you a piece you go with it so that is what you will bring so he has given you the holy spirit so that spirit that was in him it has to be the same Spirit In You and the prophet is using the word dovetail so this it has to be the same what was in him has to be in you then by that you can say I and my father are the same or I and my father are one can it happen can it happen that's what he's looking for that is the purpose of the Covenant so he wants to make a covenant how he can only make a covenant remember we say it as long as you remain a man or a woman there is no way you will feel you will fulfill you are part of the Covenant so it has to be God making a covenant with God and we started by saying you make an agreement for something to achieve something so that's what we what we will look for or that's what we will discuss next time why he has made a covenant with you what does he want to achieve for those who are in let's preach we we talked about it briefly we said he makes a covenant with you so that you can fulfill in the message what the Holocaust was given for he says so that you can continue the work that he did not finish what was part of that work he was to forgive sins so if you have an unforgiving spirit there is no way he can make a covenant with you and there's more thing you walk away there is no way he can make a covenant with you he was to impart eternal life so you are here if he makes a covenant with you he wants you to impart eternal life somebody talks to you then you talk you talk to him back or harm it changes the person that is if he has met a covenant with you amen so far so good I hope you are following my testimony oh my goodness okay still in the message faith paragraph e45 the prophet says then what did God do at Calvary he took Christ Jesus his son and put him on the cross and he tore him in two he rented the soul from the body and he took the body up into heaven and sent back the Holy Ghost to the church that on that day The Same Spirit that was upon Christ Jesus has to be in the church is that too much for us if we can hit to that point where you can say I and my father are one if we if each one of us can get to that point it will make the work for the pastor easier where you can say I and my father are one okay so that on that day The Same Spirit that was upon Christ Jesus has to be in his church to dovetail one with the other on that day and the god swore by himself that he he would raise that church up a glorious Church how can it fail that is God's Everlasting Eternal Covenant he swore by himself he cannot make a covenant with man he wants to make a covenant with God I want to make I want God to make a covenant with me but remember he can only make a covenant with me if the human element has to be taken away amen hey now listen to this love story I love it so much I hope you'll also love it that's why I included it in in my testimony okay the prophet says in the message Hebrews chapter 7 from paragraph 3 57. how did David Livingstone make a covenant with the African negro to go into his land he went and got the chief that he could pass through up there to preach the gospel and to do the work and they took a glass of wine here is the Covenant of the Negro in Africa they had a class of wine and the nickel Chief blocked his own veins and bled them out in this glass of wine and David Livingston plucked his own veins and bled it out in the class of wine this tired it up Livingstone drunk half of it and the necro Chief drank half of it then they give a present one to another this is the part I love David Livingston said to the chief what do you require of me then he said that white court that you caught on saw Livingston took his coat off and give it to the necro chief he said what do you require allow me to explain this the chief he was interested in the White Court of doctor Livingston why he was interested in the gift of healing what that gift of healing no wonder most of our testimonies are centered around healing so it shows if we were there on which side we could have been because here are two people the African chief and David Livingstone Livingstone when he when he asked the when the African Chief asked what do you want from me David Livingston said I want that spear okay allow me to say this the spear under the sword can do the same the same job if somebody comes here with a spear I'm sure all these seats will be vacant and if somebody comes here with a sword the same the same thing will happen so which means the spear under the sword will do the same job so we can reframe it and say David Livingstone said give me that sword okay listen to the story now a great spear that you caught in your hand because he knowed he could go in with art so that he took the spear and they were brothers because they met a covenant the Covenant was not just drinking the wine the Covenant was exchanging the gifts now when it comes to exchanging the gifts what do you ask David Livingstone he knew that when he gets that sword or that spear he can now go with the spear let me read the story and as we are and as he went forth the tribes would run out to kill him he raised this sacred spear and they knew who is the owner of the spear you raised the sword and the enemy will know who is the owner of this world so instead of asking for the white coat ask for the sword so what happens when you have the sword the enemy will know Who is the is there okay so now we can start in the message indictment the prophet says paragraph 62 I am you as Lord I lay myself on this order just as consecrated as I know how to make myself take the world from me Lord make the things from me that is perishable give me the imperishable things the word of God may I be able to live that word so closely till the word will be in me and I in the word granted Lord may I never turn from it may I hold that King's sword so right so tightly creep it so closely granted Lord I went up in Canyon climbed I climbed Plum up where the ecos was flying around I was watching some deer standing there I knelt down to pray and raised up my hands and a sword struck my hand I looked around I thought what is that am I am I not beside myself here is that sword in my hand bright shiny crystalline in the sun I say it now there is not people in in miles or away from me from here this Canyon where could that have come from I had a voice said that is the King's sword oh I said a king's night a man with a sword he The Voice came back said not a king sword but the Kings sword the word of the Lord said fear not it is only the third pool okay a brother you can give us that slight now flight number 13. brother mavin presented this one and I picked this one from here so okay now the first pool was to conduct the body are you following the first pool was to conduct the body what for sign in the hand that is for healing hello second pool was discernment brother what do you say I I I I I I wish I I came with that Court where the Prophet says there was a case then I think I think it was Sister woods so her mother was sick then they went to the prophet and said has God shown you anything has God spoken to you about the case then the prophet says he was rebuked for waiting for a sign instead of relying on the promise so the promise is more sure than the sign the sign is to attract the small fish are we following Saints so the first pool under the second pool is just for the body or the spirit but the 30 pool now is to conduct the soul and that's why now the sword that came in the hands of the Prophet when you get that swallow that sword where does it direct it directs to the soul and once it changes you from inside then you can come to a point where you can say I and my father are one are we following Saints okay amen oh and Justin I thought now ever who that is has talked to me all my life since a little a little bit baby boy he's standing right here and I can't see him at all I said the Kings sword that would be God is the king and what is this what the word so let me ask we enter 2023 let this this is now my prayer let me live so close to the word until I become that word so that I can now get to a point where I can say I and my father are one so that is the call for 2023 God has set the call for us as a church as a family as an individual God has set the call I told you I I told our pastor you don't know what that statement means because I told him that would be my my sermon so he wherever he is he's okay with me thank you okay now do you see the call that is the call God has said for us until we come to a point where you can say I and my father are one amen may God help us okay listen to this now in the message Revelation chapter 4 part 2 paragraph 198 notice in half circle half's not yet half is not yet known now surely these things represent something all these things I've been talking about they represent something now let's see the picture because if you are just seeing there the negative you need to see the positive okay now in Exodus chapter 23 verse 13 and in Hebrews 6 12 God made a covenant with himself and the sword by himself Hebrews 13 tells us that or Hebrews and 9 13 but it was eight that he swore by himself there was no greater swear swear by when he told Abraham and Isaac there he told Abram that he would make a covenant with him an Everlasting Covenant a covenant is always made by an earth so there is nobody you take an Earth by somebody greater than you take an Earth by your mother take an Earth by your nation take an Earth by something take an oath by God but you can't take an oath unless it is somebody greater than you and there was nobody greater than God so he took an earth himself what an assurance that he took an oath by himself so in that case he wants to make a covenant with himself anything short of that you are just a church member God have mercy on me he wants to make a covenant 2023 God wants to make a covenant somebody will surrender himself or herself until he or she comes to a point where he or she can say I and my father are one somebody will do it and that's why I said my testimony that is where I want to be that is my prayer that is my desire that is where I want to be anything short of that I'll just be a church member and they don't help me yeah you can help to keep to keep company yeah I was saying this I think it was in Edmonton that uh when you start thinking about the rapture when you start seriously thinking about the rapture then you hear WhatsApp clip click when you check it is a reminder about potluck so it changes your mind from thinking about the rapture now you start planning what you take to the airport lock because the devil knows when you start thinking so close you just feel I wish the Rapture could come tomorrow when you come to that point and the devil knows so he brings something that will distract your attention so that you change your mind foreign may we not be at the mercy of the devil amen in the message Jehovah childre but this Covenant was not met between God and man God made this Covenant with himself it is all together by grace it is not what you have done or what you can do it is by grace there is no law to eat at all he never said if you do a certain thing he said I have already blessed thee and that now brings us to pretestination how will you know that you are pretestinated he flushes your citizenship and you realize you don't belong here amen now back now to our scripture Saint John chapter 10. please to encourage those ones who are already thinking home we are almost concluding so you can wake up let's finish now this scripture I know you have been reading about it but let's look at it now from a different angle verse 30. I and my father are one then the Jews two cup stones again to Stone him Jesus answered them any good works have I shot you from my father for which of those Works do you stunn me now we just this good works I was reading in the morning then I I pumped into the Matthew chapter 4. okay you can read it at your own time which are these good works they said for the good works we have no problem now which are these good works when they were hungry he multiplied the bread that was a good work when they were sick he healed their sick you can imagine you can even imagine those ones who brought there sick person over the roof and dropped him they were serious yeah they wanted their person to get healed so that was a good work they had no problem with that so as far as getting food is concerned we have no problem with that as far as healing in the sick we have no problem with that oh my goodness he even raised the Dead oh we have no problem with that that was good then as far as the good works are concerned they had no problem so we can also bring it closer Home as far as the good works are concerned we have no problem where it will become a problem is when one of us says I and my father are one We Are One in our meetings will come to a point where he or she can say I and my father are I will not be surprised if the they need to be careful some of the statements you can very easily blaspheme and they say they say to him for the good works we have no problem but for blasphemy you being a man you call yourself God so I and my father are one can we get to that point can we get to that point where you can say I and my father are one leave around the good things the good works those ones are okay they will help the body yeah but where you come to a point that you can say I and my father are one you would be in this world but you don't belong in this world we can prefer shipping here but you are not here we can talk about so many things but you are not here why because from inside he was the word now you have to become the one for God to make a covenant with God God is the word so you become the word then he makes a covenant with the word and until you become the word there is no way you will say I and my father are one so now that is the challenge for us for 2023 . can we make now that one to pay our testimony that was what mutated's testimony can you also make it your testimony but I want to come to a point where I can say I and my father are one can it happen can it happen he has shown us the way he cannot just leave us in the wilderness no he has shown us the way how we can do it and we can become we can become that because he wants to make a covenant I wonder how many of us are ready for God to make a covenant with them he met a covenant with the prophet and why he met a covenant with a prophet Peter Paul said you could not differentiate the way he treated an enemy and the way he treated a friend so by that he could say I and my father are one he could say I was not the one but I was only there yeah I was not the one I was not the one who did this I was only there then we can say he could say or he could have said I and my father I that is my testimony that is my prayer for 2023. let us stand up [Applause] I and my father are one that is my target that is my prayer so let this year be idea with that difference let it not be ah no more thing oh it is another awareness day we are going to each other oh it is another Sunday no let's have a different vision I and my father are one the prophet says when you come to that point where you can say I and my father are one then the Jews will have to manifest themselves in our meetings those who will pick up quarrel with you and say oh no you are almost you are almost blasphemy if it means that if that means blaspheming let me blaspheme it that way where I can say I and my father or happy day let's let's sing this let's let's let's look at the words of this song There is a verse that I like which says uh the great transaction is already made I am my Lord and He is mine if you can make it that way if you can make a resolution don't make up don't make oh people make resolution or from this no no no no no no no be supper and they know exactly what you are doing if you can say I and my father are one is my target for 2023. don't just let it not be emotional no we have seen people come with emotions but they end up living a life that brings reproach to the word of God so you have to be supper whether it means going in your closet and say Lord that is now my target for 2023 I want to Crucify My Flesh until I come to a point where I can say I and my father are one I've always looked forward for somebody to give us our testimony and say I have been praying for the baptism of the Holocaust and the court has answered my prayer if you are a doubting Thomases watch my life I will love such a person and I will love such a testimony and that's what I want to hear watch my life let it start from your partner you can't say watch my life worry from your parents mom dad watch my life you tell your children watch my life I have received a change you can watch my life do you know when it comes to saying watch my life that is not just asleep by a slip of the tongue it must be something you have searched yourself and you know and you know that you know oh happy okay [Music] yeah and my God rejoice and that is right [Music] baby [Applause] when Jesus walked my sins are away taught me how to watch and pray and live rejoice sing every day [Music] happiness when Jesus won my sins

my sins are before we sing the last stanza [Music] before we go to the last stanza I would like us to make this service to be authentication to our lives for the year 2023 I and my Lord are one so let us be sober as I asked brother Peter to come and pray for us let this be authentication Service it's the first year first service for 2023 but let it be a dedicational service I want to look different brother Peter Khan As we sing the last stanza my Lord [Music] fixed on this place [Music] happy day when Jesus my sins are away he taught me how to watch and pray and Liberation sing every day when Jesus [Music] I believe it is no brother Gilbert that is speaking to us this evening I believe that God is speaking to us and this is a challenge to each and every one that we can boldly say I and my father are one we have a song that we used to sing back home in a different way that what I'm doing would Jesus be pleased with whatever that I'm doing you always have to ask yourself whatever that you are doing would God be pleased if God will not be pleased then we stop I think our former Pastor used to say that anything that you are doing when you are by yourself that you cannot show somebody that means you're not supposed to do it oh yes Lord as we bow our heads I want us all to pray yes [Music] yes and tell the Lord to help us that as we enter into this year that we can boldly say our most precious Heavenly Father what a wonderful Lord that we say yes Lord we never come before you that you leave us orphans Lord you can take any thing to speak to you and tonight you took brother Gilbert to come and speak to us Lord father this time of the year everybody is making a resolution what they are going to do and father brother Gilbert has come tonight even if we don't have anything he is come to help us to study the year by consecrating Our Lives yes yes by telling our family by telling our children yes yes that watch my life for somebody to come out and say that watch my life they mean it and father we cannot do it by ourselves oh yes Lord unless you help us help us so we humbly ask you Lord Jesus that we are taking this challenge yes Father to say that I and my father are one help us Lord we will fail miserably if we have to do it on our own we need you to help us to take this journey to take this challenge yes and I said Church yes as a family yes no we are calling upon thy name this evening oh yes each one of us yes to take up this challenge Yes master but otherwise we'll be church goers oh yes we will just come here day in and day out at the end of it all will be free to us yes so we pray the Lord you will help each one of us Lord to sincerely yes yes Lord go through our lives whatever is wrong in our life how do we make it yes we have to make sure that we completely surrender our life to you so that you can use us Lord yes and we pray tonight Lord yes father we open every door in our hearts to you this evening come into this Earth Lord Jesus and father

name yes Lord we don't come here Lord play Church yes we come to serve you Lord and it's not only here when we are by ourselves oh yes Lord that is the most important knowing that we are not with a group of Believers when we are by ourselves that is when he tries to attack us Lord but when we have confessed and said that we and you we are one yes Lord that we can stand yes Father once again we thank you so much for speaking to us tonight Lord we pray for brother Gilbert as he says he's waiting upon you Lord yes to continue to speak to him so that he can speak to us help him Lord as he's feeding upon your word yes Father tonight we want to pray for each and every one here Lord yes Father increase our faith Lord yes Lord Jesus if we are becoming weak this is not a time to become weak
