[4:45] bless you tonight welcome to the house
[4:46] of the Lord
[4:49] used to have a couple of prayer requests
[4:51] we'd like to bring before the Saints
[4:53] like to remember Sister Joanne Fulkerson
[4:56] he's at home tonight and she's
[4:58] encountering back pains we know that
[5:01] that's that's a terrible thing to have
[5:03] to contend with
[5:04] but we know who can help with that
[5:09] just want to remember Sister Joanne
[5:11] tonight we'd also like to remember
[5:14] baby Caleb petite
[5:16] he's been in the hospital for over a
[5:18] week now
[5:19] with Caesars and a fever
[5:22] and we know that that's an attack of a
[5:24] devil
[5:26] and we know the great physician can
[5:27] intercede in that case as well
[5:31] we'd also like to remember Jerusalem in
[5:34] our prayers tonight
[5:36] my brothers and our sisters over there
[5:38] are encountering a major major event
[5:43] that's going on and I can forward you a
[5:47] speech that was forwarded to me by
[5:50] Benjamin Netanyahu but the gist of it is
[5:53] he's given them an ultimatum to stop
[5:55] throwing Rockets they've got 24 hours to
[5:58] stop and if they throw one more rocket
[6:01] they're going to March forward with the
[6:03] ground defensive and an air offensive
[6:06] and every single inch of ground that
[6:08] they March into they're going to claim
[6:10] as their very own
[6:12] and they're not going to give it back
[6:14] that is a major turn of events if that
[6:16] happens I would just like to pray for
[6:19] the Lord's will to be done in Israel
[6:22] thank you
[6:25] you just
[6:27] you just can't help but look at God's
[6:30] timepiece
[6:31] and recognize Where We Are
[6:37] let's just go to him in prayer tonight
[6:42] our gracious Heavenly Father
[6:45] Lord tonight
[6:46] we're so thankful that we can
[6:49] recognize our position in you Lord
[6:52] not by anything that we have done
[6:55] Lord not by anything that we could ever
[6:58] accomplish in this world
[7:01] but what you did for us Lord Jesus
[7:04] you had us in your mind
[7:06] before the before before the foundation
[7:10] of the world
[7:12] you said to yourself that I will have a
[7:16] people that I will redeem
[7:20] and even angels don't understand what it
[7:22] means to be redeemed
[7:26] oh God tonight there's some people that
[7:29] understand what it means to be redeemed
[7:32] to know that our souls dangle over hell
[7:37] by a chain
[7:41] a chain that you have ordained Lord God
[7:44] a Scarlet chain a Scarlet thread
[7:48] oh Father to have that revelation of
[7:52] what it means to be redeemed to have a
[7:54] revelation of what it means to be bought
[7:57] back because you owned us from before
[7:59] the foundation of the world to know that
[8:01] you see us as your sinless spotless
[8:05] virtuous bride contrary to what this

[27:34] yeah as our pastor has said I was
[27:38] scheduled to be in late preach
[27:41] and I actually wanted to conclude the
[27:49] the thought that
[27:52] okay
[27:54] the thought that we were having I
[27:55] started in I started it in 11th Bridge
[27:58] and we were saying just as the brother
[28:01] Paul has
[28:02] been inspired to think that that song
[28:04] that he's here
[28:12] is it okay
[28:14] thank you my brother
[28:16] we were saying fear not he's here
[28:21] fear not he's in the board
[28:23] so if he's in the boat he knows all that
[28:26] is happening
[28:27] regardless of where the weeds the the
[28:30] the the the the the the the the the the
[28:32] winds are blowing recruitness of the
[28:35] situation he knows each and everything
[28:39] so now that he is there just Reach Out
[28:42] And Touch him
[28:43] and you'll never be the same
[28:46] that's all that we need just reach out
[28:49] if he's here then touch him
[28:52] amen oh my goodness
[28:55] Saint Mark chapter 11. the pastor has
[28:58] been speaking on this subject and I
[29:00] can't deviate from it
[29:02] it happened that those are the
[29:04] scriptures I'm going to read and I
[29:06] believe we are going to be blessed I I
[29:09] just failed so humble when the pastor
[29:12] prayed he con he he gave a summary of
[29:15] the of the salmon now I said what am I
[29:17] going to do to preach because people
[29:19] might say we are hard talked about it
[29:22] but anyway that was the prayer God
[29:24] intended it to be that way so for those
[29:27] who are following the prayer that was
[29:29] the summary of the sermon
[29:34] Mark chapter 11.
[29:38] we read from verse 23 to 25.
[29:43] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[29:46] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[29:49] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[29:51] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[29:54] shall believe that those things which he
[29:56] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[29:59] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[30:03] you what things so ever you desire when
[30:05] he pray believe that he received them
[30:08] and he shall have them
[30:10] and when he stand praying forgive if he
[30:13] have ought against any that your father
[30:16] also which is in heaven May forgive you
[30:18] your trespasses
[30:20] then we'll also turn to Hebrews chapter
[30:23] 6 verse 1 to 3.
[30:36] therefore leaving the principles of the
[30:39] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[30:43] Perfection not laying against the
[30:45] foundation of repentance from dead works
[30:48] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[30:51] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[30:54] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[30:58] Eternal judgment and this we will do if
[31:01] God permit may God bless the reading of
[31:04] the word you can take your seats
[31:13] laughs
[31:16] now this evening
[31:19] I've called it the title of my sermon if
[31:22] you say not if I say
[31:28] not if I say
[31:31] that is a quote the prophet said
[31:34] if you say not if I say
[31:37] that is the power that God has given to
[31:40] the church
[31:42] if you say
[31:45] not if I say
[31:47] but if you say so that power has been
[31:50] given to us
[31:52] so it is now us to recognize that power
[31:57] that is in US then we exercise it
[32:01] but if we have the power and we cannot
[32:04] exercise it what is the problem
[32:08] we have not allowed ourselves to
[32:11] recognize Who We Are
[32:14] now
[32:15] the ultimate promise of the pride is the
[32:18] speaking condition
[32:20] I'll repeat it again the ultimate
[32:23] promise of the pride is the speaking
[32:25] condition
[32:28] I expected a very big amen
[32:34] that is that is the climax of the
[32:36] message of the hour
[32:38] the speaking condition the third pool
[32:43] and that's why I said if you say not if
[32:46] I say
[32:47] that is God Christ is said he's telling
[32:50] you if you say to this mountain
[32:53] not if I say to this mountain if you say
[32:56] to this mountain so it is now you to say
[33:00] amen now we've been saying we are we
[33:04] were saying that fear not
[33:07] now the absence of fear is faith
[33:10] and we say it
[33:13] fear
[33:15] is
[33:18] a captive
[33:19] of all situations
[33:22] but the faith is the master
[33:25] now when the master comes every other
[33:29] thing has to keep quiet
[33:32] oh my
[33:34] God can it happen
[33:37] yes yes when the master comes
[33:39] everything has to keep quiet and listen
[33:42] to what the master has to say
[33:45] so let us invite now the master
[33:48] to come and say
[33:51] now
[33:52] for fear to be cast out perfectly we
[33:55] need perfect faith
[33:58] and the perfect faith is different from
[34:00] normal faith
[34:03] we have to differentiate that
[34:06] you woke up in the morning you had faith
[34:08] that you will come to church and
[34:10] unbeliever woke up in the morning had
[34:13] faith that he will accomplish what he
[34:14] planned to do
[34:17] he had faith we had Faith but now the
[34:21] rapturing faith is a different faith
[34:25] we will see how to come to the rapturing
[34:27] faith
[34:30] now
[34:32] these are the faith that we had in seven
[34:35] Church ages it could not take it could
[34:38] not bring the rapture
[34:43] so we need a different faith that will
[34:47] bring the translation of our bodies
[34:53] now
[35:00] no no believer will get I will I will
[35:03] explain that statement No believer will
[35:05] get that faith on the rapturing on on
[35:07] the Rapture Day
[35:09] that it will be being dished
[35:11] or you can have it you can have it now
[35:13] you can have it no those who will make
[35:17] it to the Rapture they are packing the
[35:19] proctoring faith now
[35:22] they are packing it today how by hearing
[35:26] because faith comes by hearing and
[35:29] hearing by the word now the word that
[35:31] you hear it brings Faith every time you
[35:35] hear it increases your faith
[35:42] so you cannot just sit there that I will
[35:45] make it by chance no
[35:48] because faith comes by hearing
[35:57] amen
[35:58] and that faith comes from only one
[36:02] source
[36:05] that is the perfect word of God
[36:12] now our calling today is perfect Faith
[36:15] which comes by hearing perfect word or
[36:18] the complete word
[36:22] now it is not your effort
[36:24] but what you believe in
[36:31] may God help us
[36:35] now in the message perfect Faith the
[36:37] prophet says paragraph 39 I want you to
[36:40] catch this now
[36:42] we the church has got to lift itself in
[36:45] the power of God how we are too close to
[36:49] the end
[36:51] now
[36:52] and I believe the church is in a
[36:55] condition where we can teach it a little
[36:58] deeper things and wrap some of this make
[37:01] believe out
[37:07] so
[37:09] and that's why Paul said we need
[37:12] let us
[37:14] forget about the foundations
[37:17] perfection
[37:20] how are we going to go into perfection
[37:24] we have received it but the perfect word
[37:27] but why is it not producing fruits
[37:32] anytime message has to produce anytime
[37:35] fruits
[37:38] we will come to eat
[37:41] amen
[37:45] now in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 13
[37:48] from verse 13 is a familiar scripture
[37:52] that we know when Jesus said who two
[37:56] people say I am
[38:00] then the disciples saying what people
[38:02] say
[38:05] when it comes to what people say we can
[38:07] quote it very much
[38:09] perfectly
[38:11] but then he changed the scenario and
[38:14] said who do you say
[38:17] now when it comes to an individual you
[38:21] must know exactly what you are talking
[38:23] about
[38:29] remember
[38:30] the other time I say it my inspiration
[38:33] came from two messages
[38:35] one is I know my redeemer liveth
[38:43] now you need to come
[38:45] where you say I know
[38:51] that is not we know
[38:53] I know so it has to be a personal
[38:57] revelation
[38:59] so when Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[39:04] it was a personal revelation
[39:10] so that's why I said when it comes to
[39:13] you giving a personal testimony you must
[39:16] know exactly what you are talking about
[39:18] and where you are standing
[39:27] one time
[39:29] after I had just believed
[39:32] then
[39:33] I met a man
[39:36] who was out of his mind
[39:39] he was running around kicking everything
[39:43] then I said but but I'm a Christian I
[39:46] should pray for this guy I I almost had
[39:49] it very rough
[39:50] [Laughter]
[39:54] then another another uh another time
[39:58] we were invited by a sister to go and
[40:00] pray for her mother who was in an insane
[40:03] Institution
[40:04] so I went with a brother a friend of
[40:06] mine
[40:07] and uh when we met with the mother she
[40:11] was okay we were chatting and she was
[40:15] she she was good then another Pharaoh
[40:18] came by he listened to all that we were
[40:21] talking about
[40:22] that the brother that I was with he
[40:24] asked him
[40:26] do you want us to pray for you
[40:29] that statement woke up the demons
[40:31] [Laughter]
[40:35] when he when he heard about prayer
[40:39] that guy became Wild
[40:41] why am I saying this you must know where
[40:45] you are standing
[40:48] some situations you must know who you
[40:50] are
[40:51] when you are confronted with those
[40:53] equations you must know exactly who you
[40:55] are why am I saying like this
[40:58] we are manifested sons of God
[41:02] now if we are manifested sons of God
[41:04] then we are the manifestations
[41:11] amen
[41:16] now for you to come into the faith of
[41:19] this hour you must be ready to lose your
[41:22] opinion
[41:23] you must be ready to lose your intellect
[41:26] you must be ready to lose your feelings
[41:28] and you must be ready to lose the way I
[41:31] see it
[41:36] it has to be the way he has said it
[41:40] will get there
[41:43] now
[41:44] but our faith is not not perfected until
[41:50] the opening of the seals
[41:53] until the seals are opened to you
[42:00] oh my goodness
[42:04] of the serious revealing
[42:11] Korea open to you they reveal Christ to
[42:14] you then you being in him you see
[42:17] yourself
[42:19] and that's why the prophet said when the
[42:21] seals were opened the Bible became a
[42:23] newborn a new Bible
[42:32] amen
[42:39] okay
[42:42] now
[42:44] faith is based on forgiveness
[42:50] and then as we said this morning that's
[42:52] uh in in in the message perfect Faith
[42:55] paragraph 19.
[42:58] as we said this morning try to get the
[43:01] church into the place to where we could
[43:03] really see Apostolic times moving Among
[43:06] Us
[43:07] that is what we all hunger
[43:10] and it's just laying right at the door
[43:13] we see it but we want to see it more
[43:20] we wanted such a flow that it will help
[43:24] it will be helped to us
[43:26] and flow us and flow from us to others
[43:36] oh my
[43:39] I pray that it will come out the way the
[43:42] way it got revealed it to me
[43:45] it flows through you until you can give
[43:49] it to others
[43:54] it reminds me the scripture where Jesus
[43:56] Christ said whomsoever since you remit
[43:58] it will be remitted
[44:00] we are the only people who can forgive
[44:03] people sins
[44:07] do we believe it
[44:11] whomsoever since you remit they will be
[44:15] remitted what if you don't forgive
[44:25] I believe we need to get to a point
[44:27] whereby we know ourselves and when you
[44:31] are walking you know it is Christ who is
[44:33] walking
[44:37] the human element has gone so far and
[44:41] then when you walk as well it is Christ
[44:43] who is working and whatever you do you
[44:46] do it because Christ has shown it to you
[44:48] we are going to say I have the quote he
[44:50] shows you and and you whatever you do
[44:53] you do nothing except what he has shown
[44:56] you to do
[45:01] if you cover yourself
[45:03] you'll be disappointed
[45:09] amen
[45:14] stealing the message perfect Faith now
[45:16] listen close see it is not what you
[45:19] imagine it is just as real to you as
[45:22] innocence of your body will declare
[45:24] anything else it is just as real as my
[45:27] eyes says this is a piece of paper it's
[45:30] just as real as to say that that is
[45:33] light it's just as real as to say I feel
[45:36] my court it's just as real as as as as I
[45:40] hear that people talk Talking there or
[45:42] making its noise see that's real as
[45:46] music playing it's just as real as I
[45:48] test anything in my mouth it is it is
[45:51] that real only you can't show it to
[45:54] somebody else you have it alone I am man
[45:57] it is yours faith is a substance it is
[46:01] yours
[46:02] amen
[46:04] thank you Lord
[46:08] now these are real deep lessons and I
[46:11] will catch the top of it then you dig
[46:13] down into it
[46:15] imagine the prophet saying it's a deep
[46:17] teaching he will just touch it on top of
[46:20] it but then you go deeper
[46:22] oh my now that's where we are going
[46:27] oh my I feel like jumping up now
[46:30] [Laughter]
[46:32] oh my
[46:34] God okay
[46:36] now notice it is something that you
[46:39] possess not imagination
[46:42] if you really have it it's just as real
[46:45] as you as any other thing that could be
[46:48] it is just as real as you know that you
[46:51] are writing in your automobile it is
[46:54] just as real as you know that you are
[46:57] sitting in the church you are sitting in
[46:58] the church it is just as real as you
[47:01] hear my voice it is a substance not an
[47:04] imagination not an emotion but it's
[47:07] something that you have and it comes to
[47:09] you by hearing the word of God only
[47:13] okay
[47:14] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[47:17] word of God that puts it back to where
[47:20] you are Faith then it is not it is not
[47:23] in some individual it is in a man it's
[47:27] not in an organization but it is in you
[47:30] as a person
[47:32] amen
[47:35] Faith cometh by hearing
[47:39] maybe Pastor if you will allow me I'll
[47:41] say if you can allow me to say this
[47:45] if I think many of us
[47:49] have taken advantage of covet so that we
[47:52] don't even listen to the word
[48:00] I hope the rest you will forgive me
[48:03] Pastor you'll forgive me to say this
[48:06] sometimes I beat for the Deacons
[48:09] two more slots remaining one more slots
[48:12] remaining and it goes for one hour
[48:14] without somebody responding
[48:22] and yet Faith cometh by hearing
[48:32] we want faith
[48:34] but we don't want the process
[48:40] God have mercy on us
[48:45] have we lost the interest
[48:50] the more closer we are
[48:54] the more we need to be focused
[49:00] the more we need to
[49:03] get away all the distractions
[49:07] we know we have the challenges but
[49:09] remember our subject is Jesus is in the
[49:12] pot
[49:13] so even with those challenges Jesus
[49:16] Christ is still in the body
[49:18] he's still the same yesterday today and
[49:20] forever
[49:21] so if he is in the boat he knows exactly
[49:24] what you are going through
[49:25] he knows exactly what I'm going through
[49:32] he's here
[49:35] we only need to touch him
[49:37] but Faith cometh by hearing
[49:41] amen
[49:43] okay
[49:47] now when you get this kind of Faith or
[49:50] this type of Faith you better doubt what
[49:53] you are seeing than doubt that Faith
[49:56] which is a super sense
[49:59] can somebody without what he's seeing
[50:07] you doubt what you are seeing
[50:10] I don't know if I'm seeing Barry or I'm
[50:12] seeing somebody else
[50:15] God help us
[50:17] now in the spirit Realm
[50:19] are ready to
[50:22] you are ready to doubt even your
[50:24] memories you are ready to doubt even
[50:26] your affections you are ready to doubt
[50:28] even your your reasonings
[50:33] if you end that channel
[50:37] now
[50:39] and this comes by how much of this what
[50:43] you have packed in your soul
[50:48] it comes by how much you have packed
[50:56] now that brings us to the to the point
[50:58] where
[50:59] quality and the quantity
[51:02] quality
[51:03] is what that we have it is quality
[51:06] it has addressed every situation in this
[51:09] in this world
[51:11] so as far as what it is concerned we
[51:14] have no problem
[51:15] but now what we need is the quantity
[51:20] and the quantity depends on how much you
[51:23] Feast on it how much you eat how much
[51:26] you are packing
[51:29] how much how many how many hours how
[51:32] many what fraction of the day do you
[51:34] give to this world
[51:48] so
[51:52] the quantity is the difference between
[51:54] where I am and perfect faith
[51:58] I love that
[52:01] the quantity is the difference between
[52:03] Where You Are
[52:05] and perfect faith
[52:07] so we want to talk about perfect Faith
[52:10] but how much quantity do you have
[52:18] hello
[52:20] I believe I'm talking to somebody I'm
[52:22] also speaking to myself
[52:24] the difference the quantity is the
[52:27] difference between where I am and
[52:30] perfect faith
[52:38] amen
[52:44] okay
[52:45] in the message presuming paragraph 77
[52:48] the prophet says Paul according to
[52:51] Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 5 he said God
[52:55] predestinated us before the foundation
[52:57] of the world to the adoptions of sons in
[53:00] Jesus Christ
[53:02] how are you going to stop it all devils
[53:06] in hell you might as well quit fasting
[53:08] about it it is going to be there without
[53:11] spot or wrinkle
[53:14] it is going to to be what a bright judge
[53:18] Hallelujah God said I will restore
[53:22] restore what one without organization or
[53:26] touch one without pure another one one
[53:29] with the pure and not alterated word it
[53:32] has to come
[53:36] the other time I say it
[53:39] God's purpose
[53:42] however however how how it doesn't
[53:45] matter how many demons comes in your way
[53:49] God's purpose has to be fulfilled
[53:53] now God's purpose in our day is to get
[53:57] upright without spot or wrinkle that is
[54:01] his purpose
[54:02] oh no matter you are unbelief or
[54:05] whatever God has to achieve his purpose
[54:08] so there has to come somebody that will
[54:11] believe this word a hundred percent
[54:17] remember we said about the the three the
[54:21] Hebrew children
[54:23] when the when when when the king said
[54:26] the fire had to be multiplied seven
[54:29] times the prophet said multiplying it
[54:32] even a thousand times would not change
[54:34] God's purpose
[54:36] oh my goodness
[54:38] [Laughter]
[54:40] oh my
[54:42] God that is somebody who knows where
[54:44] he's standing
[54:46] oh God help us
[54:51] amen
[54:53] okay
[54:58] okay
[55:01] Bye by his faith in his word we
[55:06] he conquer us
[55:12] that is paragraph 141 of perfect faith
[55:15] the prophet is saying by his faith in
[55:19] his word we
[55:21] he
[55:22] congas
[55:25] are we getting that English
[55:29] we
[55:31] he conquers
[55:33] who is Conquering him
[55:40] through US amen
[55:42] we he conquers
[55:46] so through you he conquers
[55:50] so without you how is he going to
[55:52] conquer
[55:54] then how is he going to conquer by how
[55:57] much you have packed in your soul how
[56:00] much the word you have packed in your
[56:02] soul
[56:05] Prophet says
[56:07] you become the one
[56:09] as you hear the word
[56:12] so what you hear is what you become
[56:17] but we have come to a point where
[56:20] we feed the plaque dog more than we feed
[56:23] the white dog and yet we want the white
[56:25] dog to be victorious
[56:33] oh my I love this
[56:38] we he conquers
[56:40] we can conquer anything
[56:44] anything
[56:49] both death hell under the grave
[56:53] we know that God is God
[56:56] that perfect faith in God's perfect
[56:58] world
[56:59] he conquered everything that he came in
[57:04] contact with
[57:09] death he could not even death could not
[57:11] even stand in his presence sickness
[57:14] could not even stand in his presence
[57:16] flowing from him was like rivers of
[57:19] virtue going out constantly what you
[57:22] going from his comment all those people
[57:24] laying in his Shadows step put their
[57:27] finger on his comment and were healed
[57:31] there he was walking in a world with
[57:35] perfect Faith because he was the word
[57:41] how do we become the word
[57:44] feet on the word
[57:47] pack it
[57:49] pack it
[57:51] pack it
[57:53] by the way the more you listen to the
[57:55] word when the preacher comes here you
[57:57] will know whether he's preaching the
[57:59] message whether he's preaching the
[58:01] message or his own ideas
[58:03] you are so much in tune with the word
[58:06] until every statement that is made you
[58:08] at least have an idea where it came from
[58:14] it's happening
[58:16] it can happen
[58:19] but some but it it happens that many of
[58:23] us we wait until what we will hear from

[1:03:47] storm and you have believed his word you
[1:03:50] have the potential also to calm the

[1:04:32] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:04:35] anything until sin of the father or the
[1:04:38] father shot him first Harmony between
[1:04:40] God and the Christ see John 5 19 so is
[1:04:45] the pride he shows her his word of life
[1:04:49] he shows how she receives it
[1:04:52] she never doubts it
[1:04:54] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:05:01] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:05:05] will raise it up again amen then I go I
[1:05:09] caught a great big Hallelujah here is
[1:05:12] the sacred the word is in the bride
[1:05:14] under the might of Christ to know what
[1:05:18] he once done with the word
[1:05:22] that's right
[1:05:24] the what is in the pride
[1:05:27] how did it end
[1:05:29] you pack it
[1:05:31] the more you pack it
[1:05:34] the more you pack it
[1:05:36] actually the the okay I I hope we'll get
[1:05:39] there the prophet says
[1:05:42] it will come from inside you
[1:05:45] it will not come from outside it has to
[1:05:49] come from inside you and it it depends
[1:05:52] on how much you have packed inside
[1:05:56] oh my goodness
[1:06:00] oh my
[1:06:03] amen the what is in the pride the mind
[1:06:06] of Christ to know what he once done with
[1:06:09] the word and he does it in his name
[1:06:12] she has thus says the Lord then it is
[1:06:15] traumatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it
[1:06:19] until it is grown and serves its purpose
[1:06:24] this ministry has no place for fear but
[1:06:28] perfect faith
[1:06:31] fear not
[1:06:33] fear not
[1:06:34] he's here
[1:06:36] fear not he's in the body
[1:06:39] fear not so that's the ministry that
[1:06:42] this ministry that we have
[1:06:45] no place for fear
[1:06:47] but it has placed for perfect faith
[1:06:51] and the perfect faith is a master of
[1:06:54] circumstances
[1:06:56] but it doesn't mean that the storms will
[1:06:58] not come
[1:07:00] the storms will come
[1:07:02] but what happens allow the master to
[1:07:04] take control of the situation
[1:07:07] oh my
[1:07:10] oh yes they do only his will
[1:07:14] I will believe that no one can persuade
[1:07:16] them different they have that says the
[1:07:19] Lord or they keep silent then they will
[1:07:22] do the works of God for it is himself in
[1:07:26] them continuing his word to fulfill as
[1:07:30] he did completely in his days all things
[1:07:33] when he was here he did not complete and
[1:07:37] when he was here for it was not yet time
[1:07:46] so now who are to fulfill that
[1:07:50] somebody has to fulfill it
[1:07:53] I pray that I be the one to fulfill it
[1:07:57] no wonder the prophet said if there is
[1:07:59] only one person in Calgary let me be the
[1:08:01] one
[1:08:04] oh my now let us stand like Joshua and
[1:08:08] Karen now watch close this is going to
[1:08:10] have a spiritual background
[1:08:12] now let us stand like Joshua in the
[1:08:15] caliph as we see the promised land
[1:08:17] coming inside it is nearing the time to
[1:08:20] be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior
[1:08:22] and represents the promised end-time
[1:08:25] leader to take the church over Cara
[1:08:28] represents the True Believer who stayed
[1:08:31] with Joshua do we have Joshua
[1:08:34] do we have Joshua
[1:08:37] then there must be Academy somewhere let
[1:08:39] me be the caliph
[1:08:41] let me let me be the caliph
[1:08:44] The Pride that stands with Joshua
[1:08:47] with the message of Joshua let me be the
[1:08:50] Caleb
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:55] now
[1:09:02] okay
[1:09:09] now listen to this now remember
[1:09:12] they had the power Jesus had given them
[1:09:15] the power to heal the sick to raise the
[1:09:18] dead and to cast out Devils just a few
[1:09:21] days before that they had the power but
[1:09:24] not the faith to use the power now there
[1:09:28] is the pranam tapanaku there is the
[1:09:30] church The Pride today the holy spirit
[1:09:33] is here with the power but you haven't
[1:09:36] quoted that Faith to move it
[1:09:42] it takes Faith to move it here I got a
[1:09:46] shell that I had loaded I think he's
[1:09:48] talking of a gun I know what it will do
[1:09:51] by ballistics like the word but it has
[1:09:54] got to fire the gun the fire has to get
[1:09:57] to the powder and the powder has got the
[1:10:00] power but it has got to have the fire to
[1:10:03] light it off and the same thing the
[1:10:06] powder is in the Shell but it needs
[1:10:08] Faith to charge it and throw it out that
[1:10:12] is what it takes see perfect Faith to
[1:10:15] ignite the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:17] which we have now
[1:10:20] foreign
[1:10:25] if you say
[1:10:27] he has given you the power
[1:10:29] if you say
[1:10:31] he has given either power now what you
[1:10:35] need is the faith
[1:10:37] and how do you get that faith faith
[1:10:39] comes by hearing and hearing the word so
[1:10:43] brothers and sisters let us create time
[1:10:46] to hear the word
[1:10:47] let us take time let us take time to
[1:10:50] pack this word
[1:10:52] because Faith only comes by hearing the
[1:10:55] word
[1:10:59] oh my
[1:11:01] God now the more you surround yourself
[1:11:03] with the atmosphere of the world the
[1:11:06] more you gain faith
[1:11:09] how are we going to advance into the
[1:11:11] speaking condition the power is here we
[1:11:14] need the faith and the faith cometh by
[1:11:17] hearing and hearing by the word
[1:11:21] I hope I'm communicating
[1:11:25] we need to understand
[1:11:28] because you just can't go down and say
[1:11:30] oh I need perfect faith I need he has
[1:11:32] given us the way how to get it
[1:11:36] Faith cometh by hearing the word
[1:11:42] so let's take time
[1:11:45] there was like there was a clip I think
[1:11:47] somebody sent me and they they I think
[1:11:50] there are small kids who are saying oh I
[1:11:53] thank God for Corona it has it because
[1:11:55] of because of lockdowns I have more time
[1:11:58] to read the word I have more time to
[1:12:00] pray
[1:12:04] I hope I'm not making fun
[1:12:07] but it makes sense
[1:12:12] it limits some other commitments then it
[1:12:15] creates time
[1:12:17] to listen to the what even more
[1:12:21] so
[1:12:22] as
[1:12:24] much as
[1:12:25] all things worketh for good
[1:12:30] to them that love
[1:12:34] so it might have come this way but on
[1:12:39] the other side it has made some people
[1:12:41] to throw closer to God
[1:12:49] now
[1:12:51] we are promised manifested children of
[1:12:54] God
[1:12:57] hence we need to make the speaking
[1:13:00] conditions our Target
[1:13:10] now the only thing you have to do then
[1:13:12] is have faith in what you are
[1:13:15] how faith in what the word says you are
[1:13:19] and Jesus had faith in the word of God
[1:13:21] that said what he was it is written of
[1:13:25] me didn't David in the Psalms and the
[1:13:28] prophets and all of them speak of him
[1:13:31] I am the bread of life that come from
[1:13:34] God out of Heaven amen I am that tree of
[1:13:38] life from the Garden of Eden I am all
[1:13:41] these things I am I am that I am and he
[1:13:45] knew with that perfect faith that he was
[1:13:47] the anointed Messiah that the spirit of
[1:13:50] God was upon him he said now I in myself
[1:13:55] do nothing but it is my faith in God and
[1:13:58] God was in him the word met manifest and
[1:14:02] when the word of God comes in you it
[1:14:05] made manifest for you as a Believer and
[1:14:10] as a Believer it is the faith of God
[1:14:12] that moves in you
[1:14:16] all that Jesus did was because he was
[1:14:19] the word
[1:14:23] and if I become the word then I will do
[1:14:26] all that is written of me
[1:14:31] that is not milk
[1:14:34] if I become the word then I will do all
[1:14:38] that that is written of me
[1:14:46] oh my
[1:14:48] recognize then recognize your position
[1:14:52] recognizes that you are Revelation 10
[1:14:57] you are the one to eat the book
[1:15:00] hello
[1:15:02] recognize that you are Revelation 10 7.
[1:15:05] recognize that you are sent Luke 17 30.
[1:15:08] recognize that you are America before
[1:15:10] recognize that you are saying John 14
[1:15:12] 20. recognize your position
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ recognized his position
[1:15:18] because he was the one and we have said
[1:15:21] you become the word as you eat the word
[1:15:23] so if you have become the word then
[1:15:26] recognize your position
[1:15:31] you can say that's who I am
[1:15:34] I'm revelation 10.
[1:15:36] and you can prove it
[1:15:38] you can say I am Malachi foe
[1:15:42] how behold I will send you Elijah
[1:15:47] behold I will send you who me
[1:15:51] he sent this Elijah to me
[1:15:54] and I've recognized what Elijah has done
[1:15:57] in my life
[1:16:01] this message of Elijah it turns the
[1:16:04] hearts of the children it changes people
[1:16:08] if it has not changed you then it is you
[1:16:11] is the problem
[1:16:14] these Faith changes people
[1:16:19] can turn a drunkard into a saint
[1:16:25] it can turn a prostitute into a saint
[1:16:29] this faith
[1:16:30] and that was the purpose
[1:16:32] of Malachi 4. he was two to two things
[1:16:38] he was to turn
[1:16:41] so for you to say that you have been
[1:16:45] changed then let us see we will cut you
[1:16:48] are a proof of what Malachi 4 has done
[1:16:53] but if there is no change
[1:16:57] you still have time
[1:17:04] amen recognize your position
[1:17:08] Jesus Christ recognized his position
[1:17:11] oh my
[1:17:16] now
[1:17:18] don't have time to read all these
[1:17:21] but in the message the seventh seal
[1:17:24] from paragraph 284.
[1:17:28] but I will jump because of time
[1:17:30] paragraph 285.

[1:17:35] say did I go to sleep that he's talking
[1:17:38] about the subpo canyon

[1:23:40] now this may just choke you to death but
[1:23:44] you know that men that are sons of God
[1:23:46] are amateur gods
[1:23:49] how many ever note that
[1:23:52] how many knows that Jesus said so the
[1:23:55] Bible Jesus said Did You Know Your Law
[1:23:59] say itself that you are gods and if you
[1:24:04] call them Gods which God said in Genesis
[1:24:07] 2 that they were caught because they
[1:24:10] were had full domain over the over the
[1:24:13] Dominion of the world he gave him
[1:24:16] dominion over all things and he lost his
[1:24:19] courtship he lost his sonship he lost
[1:24:21] his domain and Saturn took it over but
[1:24:24] brother we are waiting for the
[1:24:26] manifestations of the sons of God who
[1:24:29] will come back and take it over again we
[1:24:32] are waiting for the fullness of time
[1:24:35] for the manifestations of
[1:24:37] the children the sons of God and
[1:24:40] remember the Bible says all creatures
[1:24:43] are groaning
[1:24:45] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:24:48] sons of God
[1:24:49] and here are the sons of God when you
[1:24:52] tell them you are the sons of God they
[1:24:54] doubt
[1:24:58] and yet the creature outside there all
[1:25:01] nature is groaning waiting for the
[1:25:04] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:25:06] oh my goodness
[1:25:08] so in adoption is where there is
[1:25:12] inheritance
[1:25:16] Pastor do you have time to read for us
[1:25:18] Genesis chapter 25 I want to finish over
[1:25:20] there
[1:25:21] read Genesis 25. I want us to get
[1:25:24] something
[1:25:34] Genesis 10 25 5 and 6.
[1:25:38] read it loud
[1:25:46] verse 5 and 6.
[1:25:55] of the concubines which Abraham had
[1:25:59] Abraham gave gifts and sent them away
[1:26:02] from Isaac his son
[1:26:05] while he yet lived Eastward
[1:26:08] unto the East Country amen
[1:26:12] unto Isaac Abraham gave him oh
[1:26:18] that is the inheritance
[1:26:20] but Unto the Sons of the concupines he
[1:26:23] gave them gifts and sent them away
[1:26:28] now what am I trying to say in all the
[1:26:31] inheritance that Isaac was given gifts
[1:26:33] were included
[1:26:37] if we gave him all
[1:26:40] inside all the gifts who are there
[1:26:44] but to these other ones the children of
[1:26:48] the concupines he just gave them gifts
[1:26:50] and send them away
[1:26:53] can we bring it to the present world the
[1:26:55] Pentecostal s they have been given gifts
[1:26:59] and they are so excited with the gifts
[1:27:02] but to you our sons of God he has given
[1:27:05] you the inheritance
[1:27:07] and is that inheritance it has
[1:27:10] everything
[1:27:11] what you only need to do is to exercise
[1:27:13] your faith
[1:27:16] let us believe it brothers and sisters
[1:27:20] we have been given the inheritance
[1:27:24] you have the inheritance
[1:27:26] and in that inheritance you have all
[1:27:31] amen may God help us to know what we
[1:27:35] have been given that is the power that
[1:27:37] we have been we have already been given
[1:27:39] the power we only need a faith
[1:27:42] but the faith cometh by hearing
[1:27:45] as I conclude maybe the musicians can
[1:27:47] come
[1:27:50] we are talking about the thoughtful five
[1:27:52] times manifested in the prophet
[1:27:58] I love this
[1:28:00] five times the third pool manifested in
[1:28:03] the prophet
[1:28:05] first
[1:28:06] in the little fish
[1:28:08] the prophet gave it life
[1:28:11] hello
[1:28:16] it shows God is concerned even with the
[1:28:18] small things
[1:28:21] oh my problem is too big no God is
[1:28:25] concerned even if it can you imagine the
[1:28:28] little fish
[1:28:29] the gift of the third Bull manifested
[1:28:32] with a small fish
[1:28:34] he gave it life
[1:28:36] two
[1:28:38] he calmed the storms
[1:28:40] and in all those situations The Voice
[1:28:43] spoke to him
[1:28:46] so clear that he knew exactly what he
[1:28:49] was doing
[1:28:53] so the the second one he carried the
[1:28:56] storms the third he spoke with the
[1:28:59] squirrels into existence
[1:29:03] the fourth he spoke the healing of
[1:29:06] sister Meda
[1:29:10] then the fifth
[1:29:13] the one that we know
[1:29:16] salvation to the voice of sister hati
[1:29:21] five times now in those five times
[1:29:25] he shows that he's
[1:29:29] session
[1:29:31] the small fish he gave it life
[1:29:37] when the environment
[1:29:39] was not good
[1:29:44] he spoke he come to the storm
[1:29:47] and that's why I started by saying he's
[1:29:50] here
[1:29:52] he's here
[1:29:54] we only need to reach out and touch him
[1:29:58] we can awaken him

[1:30:02] awake him

[1:30:31] because we are the manifested sons of
[1:30:33] God
[1:30:37] may God help us
[1:30:39] so if he manifests five times in
[1:30:44] different situations
[1:30:46] to show us that in every situation in

[1:35:17] Lord glad my feet
[1:35:24] Hallelujah
[1:35:26] how many enjoyed that tonight
[1:35:29] certainly wonderful to hear the word
[1:35:31] being ministered
[1:35:35] I just had one scripture that just I
[1:35:37] can't get it out of my mind while he was
[1:35:40] preaching it just kept coming to me and
[1:35:42] coming to me so I'm just going to read
[1:35:43] it
[1:35:45] and then we'll pray
[1:35:48] set of Colossians chapter 1 verse 27
[1:35:51] very familiar scripture
[1:35:54] well this is what we were talking about
[1:35:55] all night
[1:35:57] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:36:00] riches of his glory
[1:36:02] of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:36:06] this mystery
[1:36:08] many people would say the message of the
[1:36:10] hour this mystery and yes indeed
[1:36:13] for a while
[1:36:15] but when this mystery becomes real when
[1:36:18] this mystery becomes personal
[1:36:21] then it becomes Christ in you the hope
[1:36:24] of glory
[1:36:26] and that's what we were hearing tonight
[1:36:27] brothers and sisters this is all about
[1:36:30] Christ in you the hope of glory not
[1:36:33] waiting for it to be someday somewhere
[1:36:35] sometime someone else some other way
[1:36:39] no way it has to be us right now today
[1:36:42] it has to be
[1:36:44] and when that happens when we can say
[1:36:46] just by faith
[1:36:49] is what the word says
[1:36:51] I might think differently I might feel
[1:36:53] differently
[1:36:54] other people might say or think or do
[1:36:57] differently it's irrelevant if you're if
[1:37:00] you're willing to speak if we're willing
[1:37:01] to speak the word
[1:37:03] then God's obligated to back it up
[1:37:08] tremendous
[1:37:09] it's bow and prayer gracious Heavenly
[1:37:12] Father
[1:37:13] Lord we're so thankful for your word
[1:37:16] thankful for the encouragement Lord
[1:37:18] Jesus that we could recognize
[1:37:21] not just something
[1:37:24] untangible Lord not not just something
[1:37:26] that's part of an association not not
[1:37:30] just a denomination not just a fine
[1:37:33] group of people but Lord to recognize
[1:37:36] the message of the hour is you in US
[1:37:39] giving us the ability to recognize
[1:37:43] exactly that
[1:37:46] Lord you don't want us to cry you want
[1:37:49] us to speak
[1:37:51] father help us to just go to a higher
[1:37:53] plane
[1:37:55] help us to pack that word into our soul
[1:37:58] help us to apply that token to our lives
[1:38:01] to apply the token to our home
[1:38:04] to apply your mind in US Lord Jesus your
[1:38:10] word says let this mind
[1:38:13] that was in Christ Jesus be in you oh
[1:38:17] Father the word we heard from your
[1:38:19] seventh angel messenger tonight
[1:38:22] we've heard it so many times Lord but
[1:38:24] one of these times it's just going to
[1:38:26] ring true and we're going to look at
[1:38:28] things just a little differently father
[1:38:31] I pray that you would Quicken that word
[1:38:32] to us
[1:38:33] Lord that we wouldn't be looking for
[1:38:35] something in the future but we would see
[1:38:37] it right now
[1:38:39] as we go forward in our lives that we
[1:38:41] would be able to say not not just be it

[1:39:16] according to what your Prophet said but
[1:39:18] it's not because your Prophet said it

[1:39:43] words that were spoken tonight that we
[1:39:46] would consider
[1:39:48] the thoughts
[1:39:50] Lord that we would look into the mirror
[1:39:52] of your word
[1:39:54] and that it would just occur to us just
[1:39:57] like the prophet said when he looked in
