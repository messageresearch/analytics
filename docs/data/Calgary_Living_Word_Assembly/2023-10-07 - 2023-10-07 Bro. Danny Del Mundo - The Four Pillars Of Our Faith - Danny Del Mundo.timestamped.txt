[38:49] family from En time message
[38:52] Tabernacle welcome certainly trust you
[38:55] feel right at home I want to thank
[38:57] everyone for making the effort to come
[38:58] out on a Saturday night we all live busy
[39:01] lives and uh I know it's the only day of
[39:04] the week we really get to get stuff done
[39:07] but there's a blessing in store for each
[39:09] one coming out to the house of the Lord
[39:12] and uh we're really honored tonight to
[39:14] have brother Danny delondo from Manila
[39:18] Philippines here it's his first time in
[39:20] Canada and we're certainly thankful to
[39:22] have him here he was our host when we
[39:24] were there in January and uh they just
[39:27] treated us like family it's just amazing
[39:30] so we are uh certainly thankful to have
[39:32] him here a little disappointed that his
[39:34] family couldn't come that was the
[39:36] intention from the beginning but it just
[39:38] didn't work out and we know that all
[39:40] things work together for the good to
[39:43] those who are called according to his
[39:45] purpose so this year is exactly what the
[39:48] Lord wanted tonight and uh we'll just
[39:50] gladly take
[39:51] it we know how it goes there's a gift in
[39:54] our brother if we go to pulling he'll go
[39:57] to
[39:58] preaching and you know just for the
[40:00] record we have not had any conversation
[40:02] so whatever happens tonight it's truly
[40:05] anointed of the lord we talked about a
[40:08] couple different things uh in terms of
[40:11] what we did when we were there and you
[40:12] know maybe a little bit at Brother
[40:14] mervin's house and what he's done there
[40:16] but that's all so when you hear the Holy
[40:19] Ghost tonight just say Amen because he
[40:22] wants to speak to you he wants to speak
[40:24] to all of us maybe we could just have a
[40:26] little word of prayer before we go
[40:28] further in the service tonight gracious
[40:31] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[40:33] your goodness to each and every one Lord
[40:35] for this time I believe father that we
[40:38] could just turn around close the doors
[40:40] of the building even right now and be
[40:43] blessed father if we were to go home
[40:45] because we know that you're here with us
[40:47] father Lord just to be able to worship
[40:49] you the way that we have to have the
[40:51] desire in our hearts Lord Jesus how
[40:54] could we express to you our love love
[40:57] except for worship father Lord Jesus
[41:00] tonight we pray that you're just
[41:01] glorified in every aspect of our service
[41:04] Lord I pray that you would just pour
[41:06] without measure upon each one tonight
[41:08] father who's made the effort to gather
[41:10] together in Your Name Lord that you
[41:12] would just speak to us sovereignly
[41:14] father that you would meet the needs in
[41:16] our hearts father Lord maybe there's a

[41:27] nothing in this world that you can't
[41:28] meet father that you can't treat that
[41:31] you can't help us with and father as

[41:35] believe father but help thou our
[41:37] unbelief Lord Jesus we're stuck in this
[41:40] body this body of Flesh and the Devil
[41:43] comes around and tries to remind us of
[41:45] that all the time oh father I pray that

[45:21] as we approach his throne of Mercy I
[45:23] bring greetings from the Philippines and
[45:25] from my family which supposedly we
[45:29] should come here together but it's just
[45:32] didn't work out the way we wanted it but
[45:35] the Lord amen has uh the best plan for
[45:38] all of us so we just agreed that we will

[46:08] and then before we throw it amen so but
[46:12] the Lord will help us amen I remember
[46:14] that uh what brother brandham said there
[46:17] was a boy one
[46:18] time and he was he was relating the the
[46:22] alphabets and say a b c why is this you
[46:26] know and uh so he just because the
[46:29] alphabet is a combination of words amen
[46:33] and uh so the boy believed that he if if
[46:38] the Lord
[46:39] will uh combine all these letters he can
[46:42] deliver the message I believe I will
[46:44] just speak something out of my heart
[46:46] this evening amen the Holy Ghost work
[46:48] between us amen and whatever the Lord's
[46:52] lead Lord leads leads us this evening
[46:55] amen so so before I let you sit down let

[47:29] 6 up to8 it says here in verse 6 and
[47:33] Before the Throne where was a sea of
[47:36] blast like unto Crystal and in the midst
[47:39] of the throne round about The Throne
[47:41] were four beasts full of ice before and
[47:45] behind and the first Beast was like a
[47:48] lion and the second beast like a cal and
[47:51] the third Beast had a face as a man and
[47:54] the fourth Beast was like like a flying
[47:56] eagle and the four beasts had each of
[48:00] them six wings about him and they were
[48:01] full of ice within and they rest not day
[48:03] and night saying holy holy holy Lord God
[48:07] Almighty which was and is and is to come
[48:11] let me read verse 7 again as we will uh
[48:14] discuss this verse and the first Beast
[48:17] was like a lion and the second beast
[48:19] like a cal and the third Beast had the
[48:22] face as a man and the fourth Beast was
[48:24] like a flying eagle
[48:26] amen may the Lord add his Blessing to
[48:28] the reading of his word de evening dear

[48:34] throne of Mercy this
[48:36] evening we humble ourselves before

[48:59] Christ's name amen praise the Lord God
[49:02] bless you you may be seated amen so I'm
[49:06] glad to see
[49:07] also uh my fellow
[49:09] Filipino Brethren here amen of course uh
[49:14] we love the pedo family so much because
[49:18] we are a family
[49:21] amen uh so brother mvin
[49:26] have long been a blessing to the
[49:28] ministry in the
[49:29] Philippines uh
[49:33] he uh he and his family have extended uh
[49:39] burdens uh not only with my little
[49:42] Ministry but with other ministers as
[49:45] well and uh you know uh probably without
[49:50] you knowing it uh they've been involved
[49:53] in uh couple of uh churches Ministries
[49:58] in the Philippines and they are
[50:00] extending their
[50:02] gratitude of course uh we were so
[50:05] blessed with uh your pastor brother uh
[50:10] Barry and the family and it was such a
[50:13] special visit for the Believers and uh
[50:17] we pray that you
[50:20] will uh what that you will send your
[50:25] Pastor more often to the Philippines am
[50:29] uh because he had we've got visited uh
[50:33] few churches but uh his ministry had
[50:36] touched a lot of hearts and I believe
[50:39] his ministry will also be a help amen so
[50:43] I would like to speak something about uh
[50:47] the four pillars of our faith this
[50:51] evening four pillars of our faith and
[50:57] this uh come from verse
[51:00] S uh we have a subtitle which is four
[51:03] Throne guards uh so the the lion the ox
[51:08] or the Cal the face of a man and the
[51:13] Flying Eagle these
[51:15] are uh beasts amen and uh so nothing
[51:22] happened here on Earth that had not been
[51:26] declared in heaven first so uh when uh
[51:32] when the prophet Moses was being called
[51:34] by the Lord and he was instructed to
[51:39] build a
[51:40] tabernacle he the Lord uh declared that
[51:45] uh Moses you're going to build the
[51:47] Tabernacle according to the pattern that
[51:49] I have shown you in heaven amen so uh
[51:55] everything thing was
[51:56] patterned uh in heaven and as the pro as
[51:59] the prophet said you know the
[52:01] prophets they're not just although they
[52:04] see Visions because they're seers but
[52:08] actually not every time they have to see
[52:11] some Vision before them but being a
[52:15] witness because prophets are seers
[52:17] they're Witnesses amen the Lord has to
[52:21] put them in an actual situation and
[52:25] personally witness amen and that's the
[52:29] reason uh uh brother brandham can
[52:32] describe how the woman in the Garden of
[52:36] Eden look like amen
[52:39] because he was uh uh uh he was taken by
[52:44] God and placed in such an actual
[52:46] situation and see amen because in God
[52:50] there's because although God is the same
[52:52] yesterday today and forever he's the
[52:54] same in the same that he is The Great I
[52:56] Am Not the great I was not the great I
[52:59] will be because in the mind of God
[53:01] everything is present and so if God can
[53:04] only uh uh pick us where we are right
[53:07] now and uh uh uh Li us in a certain real
[53:12] amen we can see things that we are not
[53:15] seeing on a regular or daily basis of
[53:18] Our Lives amen so here uh so in this uh
[53:23] scripture in verse seven
[53:26] these are guards uh uh surrounding the
[53:31] throne and you can see that this that
[53:35] the prophet said there's nothing nothing
[53:36] happens here on Earth that is an
[53:39] accident uh so that's why the pattern
[53:42] you know the center the center is the
[53:44] Throne of God and then there are four
[53:46] Throne guards we have there the lion the
[53:49] Cal uh the one with the face of a man
[53:52] and the flying eagle and these are all
[53:53] symbols because the The Book of
[53:55] Revelation is a book of symbols amen so
[53:59] now it was a declaration from heaven and
[54:02] then when God instructed Moses to build
[54:06] the Tabernacle amen all the the the 12
[54:10] tribes of Israel three in each uh uh in
[54:14] each side so they have
[54:17] banners and their banners you have Judah
[54:21] as the lion amen and then on each side
[54:25] all these banners they represent the
[54:26] lion we have you have the calp you have
[54:29] the face of a man and also uh uh uh the
[54:32] the eagle so this are the banners in
[54:34] each side of the Tabernacle now that was
[54:38] in the Old Testament and then when we
[54:39] move to the New
[54:41] Testament
[54:43] uh I have not heard anyone preaching
[54:46] about that but the prophet of God said
[54:48] the book of box is actually in the
[54:52] center amen and it is being guarded by
[54:55] the four gospels you have Matthew amen
[54:59] and Matthew uh if we analyze the
[55:02] writings of Matthew it speaks about the
[55:06] kingship of the Lord amen he's uh he's
[55:10] the king and uh uh uh Mark uh uh if we
[55:17] analyze the writings of Mark we will we
[55:19] will have some kind of a conclusion that
[55:21] Mark focus on the sacrifices
[55:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ him being the
[55:27] lamb him being you know the atonement
[55:30] and Luke being uh describe as the doctor
[55:34] amen among the uh poor right uh gospel
[55:38] writers Luke is the most educated that
[55:40] why is addressed he he's addressed as Dr
[55:43] Luke amen but John amen is the eagle
[55:47] among the group amen that's why John
[55:50] needs no
[55:51] introduction Amen in the beginning of
[55:54] his word in the
[55:55] beginning was the
[55:58] word amen no no further introduction in
[56:01] the beginning was the word and the Word
[56:02] was with God and the Word was God no
[56:05] explanation amen it's just meat amen so
[56:09] uh so you see we uh we see that and then
[56:13] uh uh now in in and this is what I want
[56:17] to to point out uh now in the human
[56:22] anatomy the human anatomy
[56:25] uh we see that the
[56:28] center is our
[56:30] heart amen it is the
[56:33] center and probably the students may may
[56:38] know this that in the heart there are
[56:41] four four
[56:43] entries we have we have the atriums we
[56:46] call that the atriums we have the right
[56:49] atrium and the right ventricle and then
[56:51] the left atrium and then the left
[56:53] ventricle so this is on the natural side
[56:57] the heart has has poor uh entries and
[57:00] then now the heart being the
[57:04] center is being guarded also the heart
[57:07] must be guarded and it is being
[57:09] protected and even our
[57:12] ribs right we have 12 ribs on this side
[57:16] we have 12 ribs on this side amen just
[57:19] like the throne in
[57:20] heaven the center is the throne and then
[57:23] we have 12
[57:25] Elders on one side we have 12 Elders on
[57:28] the other side so nothing happens by
[57:31] accident amen so the Lord has designed
[57:35] everything uh uh uh so what I'm trying
[57:38] to say that God has declared something
[57:40] in heaven amen and then went down to the
[57:43] Old Testament moving forward to the New
[57:45] Testament and now it's
[57:48] moving to the Sons and Daughters of God
[57:51] Amen so being Believers being sons and
[57:54] daughters of God Amen there is something
[57:57] that we guard and that is we need to
[57:59] guard our
[58:01] faith all right so uh that's why we uh
[58:05] uh uh and and and four you know four
[58:08] brother bham said in the Revelation uh
[58:10] preaching in his
[58:12] Revelation in chapter four he said now
[58:15] remember God's guards of the ark or The
[58:19] Mercy Seat so there are four Throne
[58:21] guards and there are four Throne uh uh
[58:24] guards also so in in in in The Mercy
[58:26] Seat now he said now he seen four two
[58:29] four living creatures now watch they
[58:30] both seen the same vision and four is
[58:32] the number of Earth did you know that
[58:34] how many knows now before we have to go
[58:36] into it four is an Earthly number like
[58:39] the four Hebrew amen uh I mean during uh
[58:44] the time now say it's a number of Earth
[58:47] n four is a number of
[58:50] Deliverance cuz I'm going to strike it
[58:52] just a minute he said real heart
[58:54] Deliverance now there were three Hebrew
[58:56] children in the F Peres amen but there
[59:00] was amen when danger come and because
[59:05] the the the three uh young men Shadrach
[59:08] mesak and Abednego stood their ground
[59:11] amen they were thrown amen but because
[59:14] they believe it doesn't matter what
[59:16] happened amen he said you know we uh uh
[59:20] the Lord that we
[59:21] worship is able to deliver us from this
[59:25] F furnace amen and look what kind of
[59:28] Faith these three young uh uh young men
[59:31] he said you know he's able he's more
[59:33] than able to do that but even
[59:36] if amen but even if we
[59:40] die even if something happened to us I
[59:44] mean if you throw us in this per Peres
[59:47] amen hallelujah we will not change our
[59:50] faith we will stand our ground we will
[59:53] not worship the image AG amen and God
[59:56] saw that Amen in God you know uh uh the
[1:00:01] the there were there were Angels the
[1:00:03] archangels were uh uh asking Lord amen
[1:00:07] would you just let these three young
[1:00:10] young people suffer this kind and they
[1:00:13] will die that kind of death amen and so
[1:00:17] uh uh uh one of the archangels said you
[1:00:22] know wormwood probably said Lord amen
[1:00:26] you called me on the scene when your
[1:00:30] judgment will come during the time of
[1:00:34] Noah we did that and we can do it again
[1:00:38] am I can just open one uh source of
[1:00:42] water and that that that fire
[1:00:46] will be faced out
[1:00:50] amen but God in heaven said no am amen
[1:00:55] and so an angel probably Gabriel amen
[1:00:59] Lord if you don't allow wormwood I can
[1:01:04] take action for that amen but said no no
[1:01:09] no no it's not
[1:01:12] you and probably Michael pulled his
[1:01:15] sword and said Lord probably this is my
[1:01:18] time
[1:01:21] amen the third but the fourth man said
[1:01:24] but the God said no no no not one of you
[1:01:27] will do that I'll be the one to do it
[1:01:30] amen so he was the for man in the ferace
[1:01:34] amen so that's why when they see the
[1:01:36] port man in the Peres it was like the
[1:01:38] Son of God Amen so now you see uh H uh
[1:01:42] so four is God's number of
[1:01:44] Deliverance John or or or or Lazarus
[1:01:48] amen he died uh first day second day
[1:01:50] third day amen on the fourth day
[1:01:54] everybody was thinking it's too late but
[1:01:58] God is never too late he always come on
[1:02:01] time because he is on top of our
[1:02:04] schedule he is absolute for everything
[1:02:07] amen so he came on the fourth day and it
[1:02:10] was not too late Hallelujah so
[1:02:13] everything so we see God so we see that
[1:02:15] God uh uh uh uh for is God's number of
[1:02:19] Deliverance now in the uh uh uh the
[1:02:24] preaching of brother Brenham the
[1:02:25] restoration of the Bride tree he said
[1:02:27] there were four death
[1:02:29] Angels amen who killed the tree and
[1:02:33] there must be for
[1:02:35] Life angels that will
[1:02:38] restore amen so that's why four is
[1:02:42] actually God's number of Deliverance and
[1:02:45] I like this statement of brother Bram he
[1:02:46] said now in the fifth seal he
[1:02:50] said uh uh and when we went on God
[1:02:53] gospels and show exactly when you enter
[1:02:55] into the ark they were guarding the ark
[1:02:57] the Covenant and then we find out that
[1:02:59] the Covenant of the new church is a
[1:03:01] representation on Earth was the Holy
[1:03:05] Spirit the blood that sent back to us
[1:03:07] the Holy Ghost and the four beasts
[1:03:09] represented the 12 tribes of Israel as
[1:03:12] it was and finding their natures and
[1:03:14] taking some nature and bringing it to
[1:03:16] each one of those four gospels exactly
[1:03:19] was exactly the same so it came down
[1:03:21] from from from the old amen and then
[1:03:24] onwards to the to the New Testament and
[1:03:27] until Amen to the human anatomy we see
[1:03:30] the design of the Lord now in in
[1:03:32] Revelation chapter 4 he said now
[1:03:34] remember God do some guards for that for
[1:03:37] that Mercy Seat Mercy Seat what is that
[1:03:39] Mercy Seat they guard amen Matthew on
[1:03:42] the East Luke Mark John all their
[1:03:45] gospels vindicate the book of Acts to
[1:03:46] come they guard it anywhere you want to
[1:03:49] amen so now it's the same thing now in
[1:03:52] the message presuming let me allow me to
[1:03:54] read some statements here before we go
[1:03:55] further now he said in the message
[1:03:59] presuming now why if there was something
[1:04:01] that was going to harm you
[1:04:04] physically you do everything in the
[1:04:06] world get lawyers attorneys and
[1:04:09] everything else to protect yourself get
[1:04:12] a bodyguard if your life was threatened
[1:04:15] this is on the natural aspect and
[1:04:17] brother brandham speaking now if your
[1:04:20] life is in danger amen you need you're
[1:04:22] are going to do everything to protect
[1:04:24] yourself get a bodyguard if your life
[1:04:27] was threatened everything else you would
[1:04:30] do it now what about your
[1:04:34] soul your eternal life is affected amen
[1:04:38] and I and we believe that in this
[1:04:40] generation in this day and age amen the
[1:04:42] bride is under attack our faith is under
[1:04:47] attack amen and we should protect our
[1:04:49] faith amen but but actually we're not
[1:04:52] protecting our faith but but God has
[1:04:55] power and God given us power to protect
[1:04:57] this Fai God is more than able to
[1:05:00] protect the seed that he had laid in our
[1:05:02] hearts amen and so these are four the
[1:05:05] four principles amen and uh uh uh we
[1:05:09] want to uh to show that these are the
[1:05:11] things that we do amen number one what
[1:05:15] what actually uh in our faith amen the
[1:05:18] first pillar of course we see that the
[1:05:21] lion amen and we see that all these
[1:05:23] things are the anointing of the Lord
[1:05:26] amen the Lord released this power we see
[1:05:28] this in the church ages amen when uh
[1:05:31] when the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:05:33] entered crept into the church ages amen
[1:05:38] he it was riding on a white horse that's
[1:05:41] why the denominations were deceived
[1:05:45] believing that was Christ because it was
[1:05:48] Christianity
[1:05:49] impersonation amen so we see that from
[1:05:52] that lion you know the the the the
[1:05:55] Antichrist Spirit was so silent although
[1:05:57] it was already in the church after 20
[1:05:59] years of perfection the spirit of the
[1:06:02] Antichrist was already working it's just
[1:06:05] right there but the anointing was so
[1:06:08] strong from the Throne of that God which
[1:06:12] was the lion but it only takes
[1:06:16] time amen that Antichrist Spirit was
[1:06:19] just waiting for something amen but so
[1:06:23] when he moved to another Power amen from
[1:06:26] the White Horse he moved into the uh uh
[1:06:29] to the red horse amen uh representing
[1:06:33] and then then then the the Believers
[1:06:35] were being marted so forth and so on
[1:06:37] Amen but God sent another
[1:06:41] anointing and so the historian could not
[1:06:43] understand why these people could give
[1:06:44] their lives like that and how could God
[1:06:47] that they worship we'll just look at
[1:06:50] them and watch them suffer amen and and
[1:06:54] and historian could not believe how
[1:06:56] could they stand all these kinds of H H
[1:06:58] uh persecutions and sufferings and
[1:07:00] murderd them amen but the only reason
[1:07:04] was God Amen sent the Beast sent the
[1:07:07] power for them to h h h uh to stand all
[1:07:13] those
[1:07:14] persecutions they could not stand it on
[1:07:16] their own but it was the power from the
[1:07:19] Throne of God Amen that was anointed
[1:07:22] that anointed these believers amen I I
[1:07:24] read a certain story that have happened
[1:07:26] during that time and he said there was a
[1:07:28] father there's a family during that uh
[1:07:31] persecution time and there's a one one
[1:07:34] family amen the father on one corner of
[1:07:36] the uh on one side of the table and on
[1:07:39] the other side amen the mother and on
[1:07:41] both sides amen are their kids amen and
[1:07:46] the the the young boy about 12 years old
[1:07:48] was the Elder and and and the father was
[1:07:50] talking now uh listen to me son amen and
[1:07:54] uh the church is under attack amen the
[1:07:57] the uh those who who who don't believe
[1:07:59] what we believe amen they're killing our
[1:08:02] brothers and I know that my time is
[1:08:06] coming one day probably right at this
[1:08:09] very moment the soldiers are coming to
[1:08:12] our house and they're going to get me
[1:08:15] and kill
[1:08:16] me and this this father said to his son
[1:08:19] but remember this
[1:08:22] son don't be afraid
[1:08:25] because even if they kill me I'll just
[1:08:28] close my eyes and when I open my eyes
[1:08:31] I'll be on the other
[1:08:33] side
[1:08:35] amen that's what the father said and
[1:08:38] then here comes the soldiers and they
[1:08:39] kick the door amen and then suddenly
[1:08:43] they pulled the
[1:08:45] kid and the father said hey what are you
[1:08:48] going to do with my son amen we're going
[1:08:50] to kill him he said no
[1:08:55] just kill me not my son it's my son amen
[1:09:00] and the father the mother was surprised
[1:09:03] were surprised they were not expecting
[1:09:05] that probably it's the mother it's just
[1:09:08] something Norm But Here Comes the son
[1:09:11] amen about 12 years old and the father
[1:09:13] was pleading please
[1:09:16] don't amen but you know the devil the
[1:09:19] devil
[1:09:21] knows how we will suffer
[1:09:24] more sometimes the devil take our
[1:09:27] children amen sometimes you say Lord
[1:09:29] just get me because I can stand this
[1:09:31] test not my son not my daughter amen
[1:09:34] just just let me face the devil because
[1:09:37] I can stand it but when we see our
[1:09:39] children amen being being pulled by the
[1:09:43] devil out there in the world or
[1:09:44] something amen it affects our
[1:09:47] faith amen but the father and the mother
[1:09:50] was surprised when the son said father
[1:09:54] you just stole this
[1:09:56] morning amen not for us not to be
[1:10:01] afraid because father even when they
[1:10:04] kill me after this as you tell me as you
[1:10:08] tell me I just close my
[1:10:10] eyes and when I open my eyes I will be
[1:10:13] in the presence of the Lord that you're
[1:10:15] praying this preaching this morning and
[1:10:17] mean it's the same thing amen so now all
[1:10:20] those kinds of sufferings Amen the the
[1:10:23] PE the the Stans were so surprised how
[1:10:25] could they stand these kinds of
[1:10:27] persecution amen because it it's the the
[1:10:30] Beast it's the power that was sent by
[1:10:33] the Lord from his about his throne amen
[1:10:36] and then came you know when they uh uh
[1:10:39] uh come the time after this persecution
[1:10:43] they They confiscated all the Bibles and
[1:10:45] history and that that was the time of
[1:10:46] the Dark
[1:10:48] Ages amen now it's a different style of
[1:10:52] the devil because from the red horse now
[1:10:54] he moved to the Dark
[1:10:56] Horse and it from from the EC
[1:10:59] ecclesiastical power to deceive and then
[1:11:02] he moved to the political power and then
[1:11:05] he moved to the spiritual
[1:11:07] realm amen which is uh uh uh uh uh but
[1:11:11] you see now God knows what he is
[1:11:14] doing and all things work together for
[1:11:16] good to them that love God Amen and so
[1:11:19] he sent another Beast of power another
[1:11:22] anointing here sent amen not the lion
[1:11:25] not just the uh uh uh the ox but now
[1:11:29] amen he sent wisdom and that's why we
[1:11:33] have heard of Spurgeon all these Calin
[1:11:35] noxs amen they were Anointed with such a
[1:11:38] wisdom Amen to battle the anointing o of
[1:11:42] the false uh uh Christ in that day amen
[1:11:45] to to to overcome amen that Dark
[1:11:50] Ages amen but thank God in this day and
[1:11:52] age that we are are living amen because
[1:11:55] uh we're now pacing the the demons amen
[1:11:58] and he rode in a Pale Horse amen which
[1:12:01] is a combination of the
[1:12:03] three amen now the Antichrist can speak
[1:12:06] spiritually
[1:12:08] religiously amen and he has power also
[1:12:11] political power and he's also
[1:12:15] connected amen so all these combination
[1:12:18] and how can an ordinary believer an
[1:12:21] ordinary uh so-called Christian can face
[1:12:24] the devil in this
[1:12:26] generation amen that's why the Lord has
[1:12:29] given us the Flying Eagle anointing not
[1:12:33] just an eagle but the
[1:12:35] Flying Eagle anointing amen so let let
[1:12:40] me just simplify this now in these four
[1:12:42] pillars of our faith just like what we
[1:12:45] did amen we come
[1:12:48] here we
[1:12:51] worship amen and you know
[1:12:55] Judah is a
[1:12:56] lion and sometimes we see we we imagine
[1:12:59] that Judah is a warrior but you know
[1:13:02] Judah belongs to the lineage of the
[1:13:07] musicians amen and in the order of
[1:13:10] battle the musicians go
[1:13:15] first
[1:13:18] amen so we come here that's that's
[1:13:21] that's the thing that we do that's why
[1:13:23] we come here even with the
[1:13:25] simple uh
[1:13:28] instrumental because it sets the
[1:13:31] atmosphere we come here with due respect
[1:13:34] and while the musicians are playing
[1:13:36] that's why anyone that is playing music
[1:13:40] amen they're not just good
[1:13:45] musicians but the pastor amen knows who
[1:13:48] to
[1:13:49] place who to approve to sit down here
[1:13:54] because we set the
[1:13:57] atmosphere it's not just
[1:14:00] music it's worship amen it sets the
[1:14:04] thone I mean it's like it's like a a dry
[1:14:08] a dry soil that is being teed that is
[1:14:11] being cultivated just like the heart
[1:14:14] that is hard amen and because of the the
[1:14:17] the the spiritual music the atmosphere
[1:14:20] that is being set amen the hard heart
[1:14:23] becom soft amen the hard soil the dry
[1:14:27] soil is being soaped and and and and
[1:14:30] teed amen and and and in that way the
[1:14:33] soil that is being cultivated is being
[1:14:35] prepared for the sea to be
[1:14:39] dropped because the seed is the
[1:14:42] word amen and so now that's why you see
[1:14:47] the lion you so you see sometimes it's
[1:14:49] it's a it's an instrumental music it's
[1:14:52] so soft something like that but the
[1:14:54] anointing you know remember remember
[1:14:58] during the time of soul in 1 Samuel
[1:15:00] chapter 16 in verse 23 and it came to
[1:15:03] pass when the evil spirit from God was
[1:15:06] upon
[1:15:07] Saul that David took an harp and played
[1:15:11] with with his hand so Soul was refreshed
[1:15:14] and was well and the spirit and the evil
[1:15:18] spirit departed from
[1:15:22] him it's not just
[1:15:24] instrument
[1:15:26] amen but
[1:15:28] it's it's the
[1:15:32] mechanics and the spirit that is upon
[1:15:35] the
[1:15:37] musician that plays the Dynamics of it
[1:15:41] amen because
[1:15:43] whatever is in the life of the musicians
[1:15:47] you know that's why you know we just
[1:15:50] don't allow anyone I don't care how good
[1:15:53] a musician is amen if he played last
[1:15:57] night in the club or something I don't
[1:15:59] care amen we don't care but we're after
[1:16:03] the life of somebody who plays the
[1:16:05] instrument amen because it is something
[1:16:08] the vibrations the spirit the life that
[1:16:12] is in the musician is being played not
[1:16:15] just the
[1:16:16] skill but the gift amen is working the
[1:16:19] anointing the life amen is being uh uh
[1:16:24] you know is being uh impressed through
[1:16:26] the instrument that he or she is
[1:16:29] playing and because of that the
[1:16:32] atmosphere the evil spirits and brother
[1:16:34] Bram you know it's not how you know how
[1:16:37] our voices are so loud you know now we
[1:16:40] loud we worship aloud when we feel that
[1:16:43] way amen but brother bham said no it's
[1:16:45] not it's not just like that but it's the
[1:16:50] lived yes
[1:16:52] voices
[1:16:54] amen that is what the devil hates and
[1:16:58] afraid of it's your life amen so that's
[1:17:02] why from the musicians to the
[1:17:05] instruments amen and and and and the
[1:17:07] Believers who
[1:17:10] worship amen and so when somebody enters
[1:17:13] here amen probably somebody sick
[1:17:16] somebody has has has burden am mean some
[1:17:20] somebody is so problematic but somehow
[1:17:23] through the anointing through the
[1:17:25] inspiration that is being built up
[1:17:28] within the sanctuary it Chang the
[1:17:30] atmospere amen and then after that you
[1:17:33] know that's why amen after we hear the
[1:17:35] word once again we just don't go out and
[1:17:38] you know okay class
[1:17:41] dismiss right amen because after you
[1:17:44] cultivate the soil you drop the seed
[1:17:46] amen and then you water it down again
[1:17:50] hallelujah amen and so that's why we
[1:17:52] just we just don't rush after the
[1:17:54] service the preaching is is very nice we
[1:17:57] say Amen to the word of God but you see
[1:18:00] we seal
[1:18:02] that amen with the form of worship amen
[1:18:06] hallelujah because it brings
[1:18:09] something amen that is when amen the
[1:18:12] word of God being preached sink in our
[1:18:17] hearts and and and the life the spirit
[1:18:20] that is uh uh contained by the word that
[1:18:23] we here transform it to the lives that
[1:18:25] we
[1:18:26] have
[1:18:28] amen so that's why you know we don't uh
[1:18:31] uh uh get paid musicians here but we get
[1:18:35] musicians that are paid by the blood of
[1:18:38] the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now that's
[1:18:42] the lion anointing in the
[1:18:44] church that's the pillar of our faith
[1:18:48] amen you know just like a mother in the
[1:18:50] house you know sometimes you go go out
[1:18:53] the father works the mother is just
[1:18:57] right there in the
[1:18:58] house amen and then the father comes in
[1:19:02] the afternoon tired in the work and but
[1:19:07] sometimes we're
[1:19:08] guilty
[1:19:10] amen sometimes I go to the mission and
[1:19:13] uh and and you know it's tiring in the
[1:19:16] mission but we sometimes I feel guilty
[1:19:19] that thinking all the things all the
[1:19:21] suffering all the all the sacrifices
[1:19:23] that you do in the mission field but you
[1:19:25] know our our our wives also
[1:19:29] suffer amen we don't know what's
[1:19:31] happening in the house amen but you see
[1:19:34] the mother in the
[1:19:35] house amen sometimes you feel all this
[1:19:38] burden all this was stuff all the dirt
[1:19:43] that you have when you have renovation
[1:19:45] in the
[1:19:46] [Laughter]
[1:19:48] house and then the whole day you see
[1:19:51] there the mother see all these things
[1:19:52] and and then you have to wash clothes
[1:19:54] laundry you have to uh uh you know amen
[1:20:00] but what makes the mother the
[1:20:02] believer a believing mother
[1:20:06] do
[1:20:08] amen sometimes you you you uh you have
[1:20:12] that kind of
[1:20:14] self-pity because you're alone in the
[1:20:16] house doing all these things amen but
[1:20:21] suddenly you start saying
[1:20:24] start
[1:20:25] worshiping and sudden it change the
[1:20:28] atmosphere amen and then it lightens
[1:20:30] your load and the work amen that you're
[1:20:33] going to do is no more a work amen and
[1:20:36] so when you start worshiping amen
[1:20:39] hallelujah and then the ironing uh you
[1:20:42] know you you you go along with the the
[1:20:45] the the tune of the music and you enjoy
[1:20:48] what you're doing amen and before you
[1:20:50] know it before you uh you finish amen
[1:20:53] the the second or the third song and
[1:20:55] then you start worshiping and that
[1:20:57] brings another
[1:20:58] atmosphere amen you're no longer and
[1:21:00] before you know it you have cleared
[1:21:02] everything and you're no longer tired
[1:21:05] and when your husband comes what do you
[1:21:07] want
[1:21:09] honey
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:15] worship that's our
[1:21:17] lion that's the lion of our
[1:21:21] faith John was was thrown in the aisle
[1:21:23] of
[1:21:25] Patmos he was alone it was miserable and
[1:21:28] he was thrown
[1:21:30] there because he stood his ground in the
[1:21:37] faith and brother there was nothing good
[1:21:40] in the alop Patmos if you can see
[1:21:42] creatures there you can see probably
[1:21:44] scorpions and there now Beauty in that
[1:21:47] the
[1:21:48] ruins amen but no matter what kind of
[1:21:52] place no matter what kind of
[1:21:54] circumstances we are in when the spirit
[1:21:57] of worship
[1:22:01] comes amen all this Earthly
[1:22:05] atmosphere amen hallelujah all this uh
[1:22:09] creatures that are so unwanted probably
[1:22:12] amen but suddenly when when when John
[1:22:15] started to worship he said I was in the
[1:22:18] spirit on the Lord's day amen it's no
[1:22:21] longer a human day but through the kind
[1:22:23] of worship he was being lifted up come
[1:22:25] up higher John he was lifted up in a
[1:22:28] certain real and then he see things amen
[1:22:31] the Earthly things that he saw now he
[1:22:33] started to see Heavenly things he
[1:22:36] started to see not just the current
[1:22:38] situation he is in he didn't see the
[1:22:41] sufferings that he was in but he's
[1:22:43] seeing things amen God made him

[1:23:23] you're going to the market and you have
[1:23:25] money to buy something amen hallelujah
[1:23:30] but when it's the other way
[1:23:32] around but let me tell you it's the kind
[1:23:35] of Worship the Lord is looking
[1:23:38] for when Paul and Silas were preaching

[1:23:48] amen look he said and the multitude rose
[1:23:50] up together against them and the Magus r
[1:23:52] sent off their clothes and commanded to

[1:23:56] stripes upon them they cast them into
[1:23:59] prison charging the Jailer to keep them
[1:24:01] safely who having received such a charge
[1:24:04] thrust them into the inner prison and
[1:24:07] made their feet fast in the stocks and

[1:28:23] why uh uh the prophet said among the
[1:28:27] team in the fold Ministry the pastor is

[1:28:35] because I'm a pastor but the pastor is
[1:28:37] the ox of the
[1:28:41] team if there are 100 souls in the
[1:28:45] congregation the pastor has 100
[1:28:51] problem

[1:29:43] our
[1:29:45] congregation we know where you are in
[1:29:49] the faith amen but there's something
[1:29:52] that upsets
[1:29:54] that and that is through the
[1:29:56] intercession of the pastor the pastor is
[1:29:59] the ox of the team you remember when
[1:30:02] Moses was uh this a good example in the
[1:30:06] in the book of
[1:30:10] Exodus
[1:30:12] uh when when God get tired of the people
[1:30:16] of Israel and the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:30:18] have seen this people and behold it is a
[1:30:21] stiff neck people 32:9 it is a stiff
[1:30:24] necked people now therefore let me alone
[1:30:28] that my wrath May wax cold hat against
[1:30:30] them and that I may consume them and I
[1:30:32] will make of thee a great nation look
[1:30:36] God was about to set judgment upon his
[1:30:41] people and Moses will be
[1:30:44] promoted you see he said now H I may
[1:30:48] consume them and I will make of thee a
[1:30:51] great nation
[1:30:54] and Moses besought the Lord his God and
[1:30:55] said Lord why do why W thy wrath waxs
[1:31:00] hat against thy people which thou Hast
[1:31:02] brought forth out of the land of Egypt
[1:31:04] with great power and with a mighty hand
[1:31:06] wherefore should the Egyptians speak and
[1:31:08] say for Mischief did he bring them out
[1:31:10] to slay them in the mountains and to
[1:31:12] consume them from the face of the
[1:31:14] Earth so God was
[1:31:18] being I don't know if I can say
[1:31:20] questioned amen but Moses asked the Lord
[1:31:24] Lord why are you going to do this the
[1:31:26] Egyptians will laugh at you
[1:31:30] Lord you delivered them out of Egypt you
[1:31:34] let them cross the Red Sea and now
[1:31:37] you're going to kill them
[1:31:41] Lord look in verse 12 he said turn from
[1:31:44] thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil
[1:31:48] against thy
[1:31:50] people
[1:31:53] Moses ask God to
[1:32:02] repent turn from thy Fierce wrath and
[1:32:04] repent of this evil against thy people H
[1:32:09] look at the position of the
[1:32:12] Prophet amen look at the position of the
[1:32:17] pastor in the
[1:32:19] church amen when when when when Jesus
[1:32:22] said to Peter whoever you
[1:32:26] loose in on Earth will be Loos in heaven
[1:32:30] whoever you bind here on Earth will be
[1:32:32] bound in heaven people just don't
[1:32:36] know amen it's not in nikonian spirit
[1:32:40] it's not something it's not an
[1:32:42] authority that you know we
[1:32:45] abuse but it's the position that the
[1:32:49] Lord amen
[1:32:53] I would say if people only understand
[1:32:57] that the pastors are more powerful than
[1:33:03] Angels who among the angels can say what
[1:33:06] Moses
[1:33:07] said Lord repent of thy evil thought
[1:33:11] against your people turn from thy Fierce
[1:33:14] wrath and repent of this evil against
[1:33:16] thy people remember Abraham Isaac and
[1:33:19] Israel thy servants to him thou swearest
[1:33:21] by thine own self and say unto them I
[1:33:23] will multiply your seed as the stars of
[1:33:25] heaven and all this land that I have
[1:33:27] spoken of will I give unto your seed and
[1:33:30] they shall inherit it forever amen but
[1:33:33] actually it's not the prophet here but
[1:33:36] you know brother brandham said amen when
[1:33:39] the prophets when the Servants of the
[1:33:42] Lord are in the rightful position it's
[1:33:45] not them per se but it's God in them
[1:33:49] amen he said that was God in Moses that
[1:33:51] was God in David that was God in Elijah
[1:33:55] amen so in in in other words this is the
[1:33:59] other side of God Amen a merciful god
[1:34:03] amen but God being a king God being a
[1:34:06] judge amen has to say what he has to say
[1:34:11] but there is another side of God and it
[1:34:13] is being expressed by his prophet and he
[1:34:16] said Lord why should you do this you
[1:34:18] have delivered your people the egyp Ians
[1:34:21] will laugh at
[1:34:23] you amen and you know what God
[1:34:26] did he killed
[1:34:29] Moses he did he he do that look in verse
[1:34:33] 14 and the Lord
[1:34:37] repented of the evil which he thought to
[1:34:40] do unto his
[1:34:43] people Ox
[1:34:46] anointing standing in the gap between
[1:34:50] judgment so the ox amen the ox anointing
[1:34:54] in The Believer the ox anointing in the
[1:34:57] church is to stand in the Gap it is
[1:35:02] intercession and the ox anointing the ox
[1:35:04] inspiration in a Believer is the power
[1:35:07] of be
[1:35:11] prayer amen we just don't pray Lord
[1:35:13] thank you for everything amen sometimes
[1:35:17] you know in social media they have all
[1:35:19] these kinds of emoticon
[1:35:22] amen and somebody please pray for me
[1:35:24] pray for my sister amen and somebody
[1:35:27] will click that emoticon that goes like
[1:35:36] this prayer is not just an
[1:35:41] emoticon prayer is
[1:35:43] intercession brother when we pray when
[1:35:46] we pray for somebody that is sick we
[1:35:48] place our position what if you are in
[1:35:51] that position what would you feel how
[1:35:53] would you pray when you are in that
[1:35:56] condition we just don't pray but we need
[1:35:58] to be identified with somebody that we
[1:36:00] are praying
[1:36:04] for you put yourself in the condition
[1:36:07] you enter in brother bham said you're an
[1:36:11] ox you bear the
[1:36:15] burden
[1:36:17] hallelujah amen so that's why in Luke 21
[1:36:20] he said in verse 36 watch ye therefore
[1:36:23] and pray always that you may be
[1:36:25] accounted worthy to escape all these
[1:36:27] things that shall come to pass and stand
[1:36:30] before the son of man
[1:36:34] amen in other messages brother bam said
[1:36:38] prayer changes sickness to health
[1:36:40] changes Sinners to Saints it's prayer
[1:36:42] you may laugh too much you may shout too
[1:36:44] much you may eat too much but you will
[1:36:47] never pray too
[1:36:50] much H it's something that we cannot
[1:36:53] overdo
[1:36:55] praying amen I remember one time uh when
[1:37:01] uh when Billy Graham was was a student
[1:37:05] and he had a professor named Professor
[1:37:07] art and uh uh during his student days
[1:37:11] they had a field trip and they they they
[1:37:14] went to uh uh to London in and and where
[1:37:18] the house of John Wesley was and they
[1:37:21] entered into the house of John Wesley
[1:37:23] and uh so they show The Kitchen they saw
[1:37:27] everything until they entered into the
[1:37:28] room and this is say this is the room of
[1:37:30] John Wesley this where he stays so forth
[1:37:33] and so on and
[1:37:36] then the young Billy Graham noticed
[1:37:39] something and he saw a pair of
[1:37:42] marks at the side of John Wesley's
[1:37:47] bed and Billy
[1:37:49] Graham asked asked what are those pair
[1:37:54] of
[1:37:56] marks and the uh the tour guide said oh
[1:38:00] that pair of that pair of marks in the
[1:38:02] carpet amen those were the marks of the
[1:38:06] knees of John
[1:38:08] Wesley that's the same spot where he
[1:38:12] leaned when he wakes up in the morning
[1:38:15] before he uh he retired in the evening
[1:38:17] spent
[1:38:19] hours praying that's why it left a mark
[1:38:23] pair of Mark at that
[1:38:27] spot and it's stri something in the
[1:38:29] heart of Billy Graham that when they
[1:38:31] went they went about to leave amen so
[1:38:34] the professor counted his
[1:38:37] students and there was one was
[1:38:41] missing and so the the the professor
[1:38:43] stopped the driver and he went he went
[1:38:45] up and uh he he went directly to the to
[1:38:48] the room of John Wesley and he saw
[1:38:51] Billy Graham kneeling on the same spot
[1:38:55] at the side of the bed he he paced his
[1:38:58] pair of knees on the same spot raising
[1:39:01] his hand and he and and and Professor
[1:39:03] heard said
[1:39:04] Lord please do it
[1:39:08] again and do it in
[1:39:11] me amen and you know the rest of the
[1:39:14] story amen you see how the ministry of
[1:39:18] of of Billy Graham went as as much as
[1:39:21] far as you know the age of uh uh John
[1:39:25] Wesley was called the age of missionary
[1:39:27] age amen and look at the ministry of
[1:39:30] Billy Graham amen it is if not if not uh
[1:39:35] more it's at least
[1:39:37] close and until now his ministry amen
[1:39:41] but
[1:39:44] look the Lord has given us more than
[1:39:46] Billy Graham and there is something more
[1:39:49] that we should be you know uh I I
[1:39:52] believe Billy Graham as the right thing
[1:39:54] because that's the only thing that he
[1:39:56] can get Lord do it again and do it in me
[1:40:00] amen but God sent forth a prophet not to
[1:40:03] do again what John Wesley did but did
[1:40:06] but we have we were given word to move
[1:40:09] forward to step into the prophecies Amen
[1:40:12] in this generation and why we can why
[1:40:15] why can't we spend more time in
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:18] prayers and brother bham said if there
[1:40:21] is anything that is a powerful uh uh uh
[1:40:26] tool amen he said uh in the message
[1:40:29] expectation so we believe that prayer is
[1:40:31] the most powerful weapon that was ever
[1:40:34] put in the care of a human
[1:40:36] being you know prayer one time changed
[1:40:39] the mind of God Amen we remember
[1:40:42] Hezekiah am mean Hezekiah amen he was
[1:40:45] sick of course we know the story amen
[1:40:48] and and that sickness will put him to
[1:40:49] death but because of his prayer it
[1:40:53] changed the mind of God Amen because of
[1:40:56] the powerful tool that Hezekiah
[1:41:01] used amen that's the anointing that we
[1:41:04] have in our faith that prayer can is a
[1:41:09] protection amen prayer can protect job
[1:41:13] prayed for his children Amen brother
[1:41:15] Benham said you know you might have a a
[1:41:17] a a a a h h a daughter a son amen and he
[1:41:21] said if you believe your safety and
[1:41:23] that's we can apply the token I mean he
[1:41:25] said you can claim your daughter you can
[1:41:27] claim your son you can even claim your
[1:41:29] father just like Rahab he claimed his
[1:41:31] whole pH whole
[1:41:33] family amen as long as we stand our
[1:41:36] ground and we don't get tired of
[1:41:41] praying the protection is not only for
[1:41:44] us it can protect our whole family we
[1:41:48] can apply the token in prayer
[1:41:54] if we bear the
[1:41:56] burden Hallelujah so that's why when we
[1:41:59] pray amen sometimes we pray we don't get
[1:42:03] tired of praying we spend time because
[1:42:05] we bear the burden
[1:42:07] yes amen so these are the kinds of
[1:42:10] prayer that God is looking for prayers
[1:42:13] that are being felt prayers that have
[1:42:15] really
[1:42:17] burdens in the hearts of the people am
[1:42:21] amen thank you
[1:42:25] Lord the third pillar of our
[1:42:27] faith amen is the face of a man amen and
[1:42:31] what's the man amen now let me put a
[1:42:34] scripture on
[1:42:36] this uh he said in Proverbs 23:7 for as
[1:42:41] he thinketh in his heart so is he in
[1:42:45] Revelation chapter 4 again brother
[1:42:47] Benham was being asked he said uh uh you
[1:42:50] remember remember recently the papers
[1:42:51] given given in Chicago about four years
[1:42:53] ago when the old believer old unbeliever
[1:42:56] rather used to say that God made a
[1:42:58] mistake through Solomon when he said as
[1:43:01] a man thinketh in his heart said there's
[1:43:04] no mental faculties in the heart to
[1:43:06] think with how could he think with his
[1:43:10] heart maybe he meant his
[1:43:13] head but brother bam said if God would
[1:43:16] have meant his head he would have said
[1:43:19] head
[1:43:21] but God through Solomon said as a man
[1:43:24] think it in his
[1:43:27] heart amen because a converted person
[1:43:31] does not think through his
[1:43:33] head think it in his
[1:43:36] heart because in our hearts is where the
[1:43:39] seed
[1:43:41] lays
[1:43:42] amen it is it is something that is
[1:43:46] predestinated right there and you know
[1:43:49] that in the later studies we have what
[1:43:51] we call the DNA and they said that the
[1:43:55] minds of a
[1:43:58] person uh can be
[1:44:01] changed because the mind can be
[1:44:04] programmed
[1:44:06] amen and I said
[1:44:10] amen so you see all this studies amen
[1:44:14] you know amen proves something that God
[1:44:18] is
[1:44:18] correct he can never fail amen so you
[1:44:22] know a man when he's being unconverted
[1:44:26] not yet being born again he think it by
[1:44:29] his mind his education all the
[1:44:33] information are being analyzed amen the
[1:44:36] way man is thinking but a man when he is
[1:44:39] converted he think it through his heart
[1:44:43] amen because now when you realize who
[1:44:46] you are when we re when we realize what
[1:44:49] kind of seed we have we realize that we
[1:44:52] are Sons and Daughters of God and we
[1:44:54] should think we should conduct ourselves
[1:44:56] as Sons and Daughters of God Amen so now
[1:44:59] when that seed recognize who his father
[1:45:02] is amen now you're no longer thinking
[1:45:05] through your mind but all the potentials
[1:45:08] that is in the seed will influence your
[1:45:12] mind and it will change it will program
[1:45:15] reprogram amen and you will think the
[1:45:17] way God
[1:45:19] thinks you will you will you will you
[1:45:21] will speak the way God speak because now
[1:45:24] the changes come from inside because now
[1:45:27] you realize who you
[1:45:30] are amen so now amen uh so that's why
[1:45:34] amen because the heart brother B said
[1:45:36] now the first Throne was in heaven
[1:45:38] judgment seat the second Throne was in
[1:45:40] Christ the third Throne is in man yes so
[1:45:45] God is dealing now in his third throne
[1:45:47] and what is the third Throne the heart
[1:45:49] amen amen
[1:45:51] that's why many people will miss this
[1:45:53] the Rapture one foot distance
[1:45:55] only just one foot amen because they
[1:45:59] believe God in their mind but don't
[1:46:02] believe God in their
[1:46:04] hearts amen they know everything in the
[1:46:06] message they have a lots of information
[1:46:09] amen but that did not change their mind
[1:46:12] did not change their life amen they
[1:46:14] don't know how to conduct themselves
[1:46:16] amen you know that's why we're talking
[1:46:18] this morning you know uh uh you know we
[1:46:20] we need to get the the the the the
[1:46:22] thinking of God we need to to understand
[1:46:25] the message the way it is being
[1:46:26] delivered by the prophet because when
[1:46:28] the word was being delivered to the
[1:46:30] prophet amen he had the right
[1:46:33] attitude amen so sometimes you know
[1:46:38] sometimes I see uh uh sometimes I check
[1:46:41] also I'm not uh I'm not
[1:46:45] uh uh I don't spend so much time on
[1:46:48] Facebook some but sometimes I need I I
[1:46:51] peep into
[1:46:53] it and sometimes I see people that
[1:46:55] they're so good in quoting you know and
[1:46:58] they will quote
[1:47:00] uh
[1:47:02] uh Church cannot save a man the pastor
[1:47:06] cannot change a man
[1:47:10] amen there's nothing wrong with the
[1:47:14] coat but when somebody is not going to
[1:47:18] church and he is quoting the
[1:47:22] statement you know what's coming one day
[1:47:25] you're not going to see this man
[1:47:29] again because that's the way he
[1:47:32] thinks amen there's nothing wrong in the
[1:47:34] code there's nothing wrong in the
[1:47:36] statement and we know where the prophet
[1:47:38] of God is
[1:47:40] coming amen hallelujah because brother
[1:47:43] bham said it's not my desire it's not my
[1:47:45] intention that people may follow me I
[1:47:48] will be happy if I see a man man amen
[1:47:51] has established a personal relationship
[1:47:53] with
[1:47:54] Christ amen but so it's not the man but
[1:47:58] God used the man to establish a
[1:48:00] relationship with God Amen and so God
[1:48:03] you see now so we have to guard all
[1:48:05] these things we have to guard our
[1:48:07] hearts amen and in our in our heart you
[1:48:10] see now now what is a man he's a TR
[1:48:12] being Body Soul and Spirit how many
[1:48:14] knows that what's God's approach what is
[1:48:15] his heart you remember my message God
[1:48:17] chose a man's heart for his control
[1:48:19] tower the devil chose his head for his
[1:48:22] control tower see he makes him see
[1:48:24] things look through his eyes God in his
[1:48:28] heart makes him believe things that he
[1:48:29] cannot see God is on his heart the heart
[1:48:33] of man is the Throne of
[1:48:36] God Amen so God that's why God sent a
[1:48:41] prophet in the ministry of Malachi 456
[1:48:44] to restore the
[1:48:46] heart to restore the faith
[1:48:50] amen because when you see amen when God
[1:48:56] gets the heart of his son it's
[1:49:00] done amen so when we give our hearts to
[1:49:02] the Lord God has full control amen and
[1:49:06] so that's why he wants to stay in the
[1:49:08] heart and uh uh so you see so the heart
[1:49:12] that's why during the time of
[1:49:16] Elijah his ministry was to restore he
[1:49:20] repaired the
[1:49:21] altar amen he repaired the altar now
[1:49:27] after repairing the
[1:49:28] altar his ministry was not yet
[1:49:32] finished
[1:49:34] amen
[1:49:36] so that's why the word amen the message
[1:49:39] has turned our hearts back our faith is
[1:49:43] being restored
[1:49:45] back amen and
[1:49:47] Elijah amen when he came to the to the
[1:49:51] ministry and he faced all these
[1:49:53] challenges in uh uh uh uh in that in
[1:49:57] that mountain amen so he faced these
[1:50:01] hundreds of
[1:50:03] denominational
[1:50:05] ministers amen and the first thing that
[1:50:08] he did he repaired The
[1:50:12] Altar and you know this
[1:50:15] message come from the Lord but it must
[1:50:19] be received
[1:50:20] with the right
[1:50:25] heart
[1:50:27] so the
[1:50:29] heart must be restored
[1:50:32] first back to
[1:50:35] God so when we come here what does music
[1:50:38] what does
[1:50:39] worship do it establish our hearts to
[1:50:43] make
[1:50:45] ready and we feel when we feel the
[1:50:47] anointing when we feel the atmosphere
[1:50:49] people people that sets us in the
[1:50:53] atmosphere of
[1:50:55] repentance asking for forgiveness asking
[1:50:58] for
[1:50:59] reconciliation it it it restores our
[1:51:03] heart amen because if our hearts is not
[1:51:07] ready the word will just stay in the
[1:51:10] mind of the
[1:51:11] people will just excite us because of
[1:51:14] the new information that we have but
[1:51:17] it's not a revelation but Revelation is
[1:51:21] dropping here into the hearts so the
[1:51:23] hearts must be restored first amen so it
[1:51:27] must be prepared because when when when
[1:51:30] when when Elijah repaired the
[1:51:33] altar his ministry was not yet finished
[1:51:35] the next thing that he did was to lay
[1:51:38] down the evening
[1:51:42] sacrifice on top of the repaired
[1:51:46] altar now what I'm saying here we may
[1:51:49] worship ship you know in the
[1:51:52] denomination they can set an
[1:51:55] atmosphere and people can jump can shout
[1:51:58] can
[1:51:59] cry as if the
[1:52:01] angels and I would say they can invite
[1:52:04] Angels down they can invite the presence
[1:52:06] of the Lord probably because of their
[1:52:08] emotions because of these things amen
[1:52:10] they invite
[1:52:12] Christ because they're calling on the
[1:52:15] Lord but it is just like Simon inviting
[1:52:19] the Lord in his house house but he is
[1:52:21] not
[1:52:22] welcome amen so what good is the worship
[1:52:27] amen so dispay musicians dispay uh uh uh
[1:52:32] uh uh uh instruments whatsoever they can
[1:52:35] establish an atmosphere that that can
[1:52:37] make people cry that can make people
[1:52:40] really worship God believing that
[1:52:42] they're worshiping God because they
[1:52:45] could feel that God is just right there
[1:52:47] somehow it could do amen
[1:52:50] amen but after the
[1:52:52] worship the preacher will
[1:52:55] say Okay praise the lord we have
[1:52:58] worshiped the Lord amen I don't need to
[1:53:00] preach
[1:53:02] anymore because we feel the presence of
[1:53:04] God let's keep on
[1:53:06] worshiping so it's just like cultivating
[1:53:09] the soil and watering it but there's no
[1:53:15] seed amen but so that's the same thing
[1:53:20] when the altar was being repaired the
[1:53:22] fire did not come down yet amen but the
[1:53:25] fire came down when the evening
[1:53:28] sacrifice was laid down amen and so now
[1:53:31] God Amen God Amen was called amen by by
[1:53:35] Elijah the prophet and so amen God came
[1:53:38] down and consumed that offering consumed
[1:53:41] that sacrifice Hallelujah so repairing
[1:53:44] the altar re restoring our hearts back
[1:53:47] to God did not end up our
[1:53:51] service but something must be laid on
[1:53:53] top of the altar on top of the heart on
[1:53:56] top of the amen must be the pure word of
[1:53:59] the Living God the revealed word of the
[1:54:02] hour amen because that is what God is
[1:54:05] looking
[1:54:06] for amen and so now amen so you see in
[1:54:11] in in when we when when our hearts are
[1:54:13] right and we are in the rightful
[1:54:14] position amen I I
[1:54:17] remember uh I remember what
[1:54:20] uh uh one visitor that brother brandham
[1:54:22] made mention a tourist uh I believe
[1:54:26] that's in in in Florence he said uh he
[1:54:29] said John spra A friend of mine taking
[1:54:30] his wife in to took a trip over lorine
[1:54:34] France and the guide was taking them
[1:54:35] through a certain garden and he showed
[1:54:37] them a statue of the Lord Jesus and
[1:54:39] brother spra said he was looking at that
[1:54:42] statue he said what did the sculptor
[1:54:44] have in his mind why I don't see any
[1:54:46] sufferings of Christ I don't see nothing
[1:54:49] just look looks like the
[1:54:50] statue amen so they were looking
[1:54:53] probably at one one on one
[1:54:55] spot
[1:54:57] and the the face of the Lord was
[1:55:00] probably within their
[1:55:02] level and he said it does it doesn't
[1:55:06] convince me that it's a good sculptor
[1:55:08] because it's just normal you know you
[1:55:12] don't even sense and feel the suffering
[1:55:14] of the Lord so he
[1:55:16] criticized amen and uh the tour guide
[1:55:20] said uh yeah maybe because you're
[1:55:24] looking from the the wrong
[1:55:27] side not from the uh the the the the
[1:55:31] angle that you should
[1:55:32] see and he said you come
[1:55:35] closer and the tour guide you know
[1:55:38] guided sprowl and then he said you kneel
[1:55:44] down and then you look
[1:55:47] up and so when he knelt down and he
[1:55:50] looked up amen he saw the face of the
[1:55:54] Lord in that that was just an statue a
[1:55:57] statue but because he
[1:56:00] was in the right angle when he looked up
[1:56:05] he saw the face the actual suffering he
[1:56:07] said my heart he his heart broke down
[1:56:11] because he could feel amen because you
[1:56:14] know sometimes it's the same thing this
[1:56:17] message you know you go you you go on
[1:56:20] social media you go there are
[1:56:23] many ones who preach this
[1:56:27] message
[1:56:29] amen and if you will not we we we will
[1:56:32] not be
[1:56:34] uh careful
[1:56:36] enough amen many many people are being
[1:56:41] deceived amen because people are just
[1:56:44] right there reading the message but they
[1:56:45] have not an actual
[1:56:48] experience with this message of the hour
[1:56:51] but they can give
[1:56:54] details but they're not looking on the
[1:56:57] word from the right
[1:56:59] angle amen so I believe this message
[1:57:01] should come to our to to our hearts in
[1:57:05] the rightful conduct in the rightful
[1:57:08] attitude amen that we can kneel down and
[1:57:11] look
[1:57:12] up we can stay humble and be respectful
[1:57:16] amen and so that's why
[1:57:20] uh with those things so that's why John
[1:57:23] amen uh uh John is the eagle among the
[1:57:27] group and that's why he presented the
[1:57:30] word hallelujah so with all these things
[1:57:33] we cannot serve the Lord with only three
[1:57:35] pillars amen you may be prayerful you
[1:57:39] may be good in worshiping the Lord amen
[1:57:43] you may be good people may be good
[1:57:45] because the the the foolish virgins are
[1:57:46] also good but they don't have the word
[1:57:51] don't have the Holy Ghost they cannot
[1:57:53] make the Rapture amen but we need all
[1:57:56] these
[1:57:57] four amen worship yes but without the
[1:58:02] word it's just a cultivated
[1:58:05] soil amen and just grass will grow out
[1:58:10] of there but when the right seed is
[1:58:12] being drop there Son of God will grow
[1:58:16] the nature of the Living God will be
[1:58:18] made man manifest amen now when we enter
[1:58:21] into that closet into that room and he
[1:58:24] said you know uh uh it's not just the
[1:58:28] the room that we have but brother Benham
[1:58:29] said we that we have a hidden
[1:58:32] place anywhere brother Benham had to set
[1:58:36] himself away and be in peace with God
[1:58:39] and he said he described a certain place
[1:58:42] he entered in a certain cave amen and he
[1:58:44] prayed there and he could you know an
[1:58:48] angel some somehow amen he experience
[1:58:51] things that he could he has a sec sacred
[1:58:55] place to go to when he prays amen
[1:58:58] probably in one corner of our room one
[1:59:00] corner of our bed you know there's a
[1:59:02] certain place that we pray but this is
[1:59:05] not just a geographical location where
[1:59:08] we pray it's our
[1:59:10] attitude it's our burden amen that when
[1:59:14] we just like when we worship amen it's
[1:59:17] not just in good times but we worship
[1:59:19] also God even
[1:59:21] in the hardest situation we are in we
[1:59:25] have seen that in Silas and Paul amen
[1:59:29] and so we enter uh uh into the
[1:59:31] atmosphere of prayer we just you know
[1:59:33] when we when we pray we just uttering of
[1:59:36] course this is a communication but we
[1:59:38] realize you know brother bham said you
[1:59:40] know why our meetings are very
[1:59:41] successful amen sick people are being
[1:59:44] healed amen HHH many miracles have
[1:59:47] happened but you see but you know why
[1:59:49] there are women seven days
[1:59:53] already you don't see them but they're
[1:59:56] in prayers so brother brandham
[1:59:59] recognized the power of prayer he didn't
[2:00:01] say I'm because you know why there are
[2:00:03] many many people that are being healed
[2:00:06] because I am a Vindicated Prophet no he
[2:00:08] didn't say that he said you know why our
[2:00:10] meetings are successful because there
[2:00:12] are women behind the scene you don't see
[2:00:15] them but they are the prayer
[2:00:18] warriors
[2:00:19] not prayer
[2:00:21] warriors
[2:00:23] Warriors amen they just behind the scene
[2:00:27] but they pray they bear the burden
[2:00:30] Hallelujah you come here in the church
[2:00:32] sometimes we just clean in the house of
[2:00:36] the Lord
[2:00:38] amen it's like what I say to the
[2:00:41] cleaners on the church you know when you
[2:00:43] come
[2:00:46] here when
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:49] wash the floor and clean the
[2:00:52] chairs just don't pray just don't clean
[2:00:56] because you are in the house of God you
[2:00:58] come here
[2:01:00] prayerful as you hold the rags amen and
[2:01:04] just clean the
[2:01:05] chairs you know you we we we can put
[2:01:08] extra mile in doing things because of
[2:01:11] the prayers that we
[2:01:13] do
[2:01:15] amen how can we do that you lay hands on
[2:01:19] the
[2:01:20] chairs and say
[2:01:23] Lord I'm just the cleaner of the house I
[2:01:26] am the one scheduled to clean but Lord
[2:01:29] As I Lay My Hands on this chair whoever
[2:01:33] will sit here
[2:01:34] tomorrow amen if he is sick if she has a
[2:01:38] problem Lord please do something Lord
[2:01:41] take full control amen you know it's
[2:01:44] it's it's an ox anointing in you and
[2:01:48] everybody can do do it amen you come
[2:01:51] here you lay down amen Lord God I know
[2:01:54] Lord Jesus amen our pastors may be you
[2:01:57] know we don't know what situation he is
[2:01:59] in amen but Lord as he stands behind
[2:02:02] this Pulpit may you take full control oh
[2:02:05] God and the words of wisdom that will
[2:02:07] come out of his mouth will be Revelation
[2:02:10] Hallelujah that will change our lives
[2:02:13] that will change our lives
[2:02:15] Lord amen we can do more
[2:02:20] that's an ax anointing of a
[2:02:22] Believer amen you lay down on those on
[2:02:25] those doors and Lord amen may we come
[2:02:28] here tomorrow when we when we when we do
[2:02:31] service Lord may we come come in and as
[2:02:35] we come out May we become better than
[2:02:39] yesterday Ox
[2:02:41] anointing amen and you know prayers
[2:02:45] brother brandham said sometimes our
[2:02:47] prayers are not being heard because our
[2:02:49] hearts are not
[2:02:52] correct that's why we need to pray we
[2:02:54] need to think so if a man can think in
[2:02:57] his heart we can also pray in our hearts
[2:03:02] amen that we come and said you know the
[2:03:05] Lord Jesus said Lord I sanctify
[2:03:08] myself for their
[2:03:11] sake amen so the Lord Sanctified he
[2:03:15] deprived himself he deprived himself of
[2:03:19] a wife he deprived himself of a family
[2:03:22] during his Earthly time 2,000 years ago
[2:03:25] he deprived he said I sanctify myself
[2:03:28] for their
[2:03:29] sakes he deprived himself for the sake
[2:03:32] of
[2:03:33] us eternal life is living for
[2:03:36] others right attitude is the right life
[2:03:41] amen and so when when when all these
[2:03:43] things amen let me tell you the word of
[2:03:47] God when the when the Pastor whoever the
[2:03:50] man scheduled to stand behind the pulpit
[2:03:53] it's not the man it's because there were
[2:03:57] Ox in the team there were Ox in the
[2:04:01] church that have prayed
[2:04:04] already amen the musicians that have set
[2:04:07] the atmosphere it's not them it's the
[2:04:09] spirit of God it's all working and
[2:04:12] that's why the word of God will just
[2:04:14] come through it's not the man but it's
[2:04:17] God
[2:04:19] Hallelujah so if if brother brandham
[2:04:22] said if in this life you have to guard
[2:04:26] your life how much more our
[2:04:29] faith we need to guard our faith and
[2:04:32] these are the four pillars of our faith
[2:04:35] lion is our
[2:04:36] worship Ox is our prayers intercession
[2:04:40] heart is a clean heart a clean life
[2:04:44] restored that's why Paul said I Die
[2:04:47] daily he had had to repent daily he had
[2:04:50] to correct himself daily because he's
[2:04:53] preparing his heart for the word to lay
[2:04:55] down the evening sacrifice the word must
[2:04:58] be placed on top of the
[2:05:00] altar amen hallelujah now in
[2:05:05] closing you know what this word will do
[2:05:08] to us we know the life of Paul Amen in 1
[2:05:13] Corinthians
[2:05:16] 15:9 he said for I am am the least of
[2:05:19] the Apostles that I am not meant to be
[2:05:22] called an apostle because I persecuted
[2:05:25] the Church of
[2:05:26] God he said this in ad
[2:05:30] 59 he said I am the least of the
[2:05:33] Apostles when he recognized when he
[2:05:36] humbled himself amen he was persecuting
[2:05:40] the the Church of God believing he was
[2:05:43] doing Godly service amen but later on he
[2:05:47] received the word when when he met the
[2:05:49] pillar of cloud the pillar of light amen
[2:05:53] when he was about to arrest the people
[2:05:54] on his way to Damascus amen and so he
[2:05:57] humbled himself and he said I am when he
[2:06:00] humbled himself he said I am the least
[2:06:02] of the
[2:06:04] Apostles that's the reason you know I
[2:06:06] have seen many people they have received
[2:06:08] the message some of them are Theologian
[2:06:10] Bishops amen and they humbl themselves
[2:06:13] upon hearing the
[2:06:15] word it changed their condition it
[2:06:17] changed the direction of their lives
[2:06:19] amen they miss some opportunities that
[2:06:22] they should have enjoyed amen if they
[2:06:25] have not Le left the denominations that
[2:06:28] they were in they sacrific why because
[2:06:31] they humbl themselves amen but four
[2:06:35] years after that in Ephesians 3:8 this
[2:06:39] is said in ad 63 4 years apart after
[2:06:44] receiving the word after being converted
[2:06:47] by the spirit of of the Lord amen the
[2:06:50] same person Paul said after four years
[2:06:53] unto me who am less than the least of
[2:06:57] All Saints is this Grace given that I
[2:07:00] should preach among the Gentiles The
[2:07:02] unsearchable Riches of
[2:07:06] Christ four years ago he said among the
[2:07:10] apostles I'm the least amen four years
[2:07:15] after among the least of the Saints yes
[2:07:19] I am
[2:07:21] less what will this message bring to us
[2:07:27] humility God is looking for
[2:07:31] character God is looking amen God is
[2:07:34] looking for
[2:07:36] character amen so if Paul could humble
[2:07:40] himself I'm the least among the apostles
[2:07:43] amen but God promoted him and yet he
[2:07:47] said four years after he said Lord among
[2:07:50] the lowest of the Saints I'm the low I'm
[2:07:54] lower than them I believe whoever
[2:07:58] received this message just like brother
[2:07:59] brandham when he receiv received this
[2:08:01] message of the hour he is fully
[2:08:03] Vindicated by the Lord but look at the
[2:08:05] character they can question his Doctrine
[2:08:08] they could they have there are many
[2:08:10] people who have testified ministers we
[2:08:12] have seen people even in YouTube you can
[2:08:14] hear Benin testifying the ministry of
[2:08:17] brother Branham Tommy osbor testified on
[2:08:19] brother benam Gordon linday amen
[2:08:22] testified on big
[2:08:24] men recognize the ministry of because
[2:08:26] they cannot question his
[2:08:29] life amen people have not followed the
[2:08:33] message through but yet they could not
[2:08:35] question the life because his life has
[2:08:37] so much
[2:08:39] influence amen because the more you know
[2:08:42] when when uh when uh uh he testified on
[2:08:46] the things that have happened in Africa
[2:08:47] in in in India amen where you know this
[2:08:52] H H uh uh track loads of stretchers of
[2:08:55] wheelchairs and and crutches amen even
[2:08:59] the mayor testified what have happened
[2:09:01] during his Healing
[2:09:03] Ministry but all these things brother
[2:09:05] brandham said Lord I have done nothing
[2:09:10] yet amen but people just have done
[2:09:13] something so little and be proud of it
[2:09:16] but the prophet of God lord I have done
[2:09:19] nothing yet and he said Lord if it
[2:09:21] pleases you that you throw me in
[2:09:25] hell oh what an attitude amen if you if
[2:09:29] it pleases you amen that you can throw
[2:09:31] me in
[2:09:33] hell but said just one request Lord look
[2:09:37] down in hell where you throw me because
[2:09:40] even in hell I will raise my hand and
[2:09:43] Worship You Hallelujah and I believe if
[2:09:45] we have that kind of attitude if we have
[2:09:48] that kind kind of
[2:09:49] nature God will not throw us in
[2:09:52] Hell amen hallelujah so we need to guard
[2:09:56] our hearts because our hearts lays our
[2:09:58] faith is amen and there are poor Secrets
[2:10:02] where we can guard our faith our soul
[2:10:06] and that is the four Throne guards in
[2:10:08] heaven that came down and now living in
[2:10:11] the heart of every individual God bless
[2:10:14] you keep on praying for me and tomorrow

[2:10:58] many points we heard tonight we know the
[2:11:00] prophet of God said real true Revelation
[2:11:02] doesn't puff people up and uh you know
[2:11:06] Moses
[2:11:07] someone called by
[2:11:11] God had the discussion with God and said
[2:11:14] you know repent of this
[2:11:16] thing repent of this thing this evil
[2:11:20] that you have
[2:11:21] desired my goodness how easy is it for
[2:11:24] us as humans to have the desire to point

[2:15:02] virgin had
[2:15:03] oil yes oh Lord help us to have oil in
[2:15:07] our lamps help us to have that Faith
[2:15:10] Lord Jesus when you return and because
[2:15:13] we know that that faith is not our faith
[2:15:15] our faith will do nothing oh Father but
[2:15:18] when we can see the ending of our faith
[2:15:20] and when your faith takes over then we
[2:15:22] don't look at the Earthly situations we
[2:15:24] don't look at the
[2:15:25] Earthly problems and and and issues but
[2:15:29] Lord we look at it through your eyes
[2:15:31] through your mind because it's not us
[2:15:33] operating any longer oh father I pray
[2:15:36] that tonight we could take the words
[2:15:38] that were spoken Lord Jesus and consider
[2:15:40] them Father that we would realize that
[2:15:43] we didn't hear from a man tonight that
[2:15:45] we heard from you father Lord if we
[2:15:48] could just take those words into our
[2:15:50] very souls and change our hearts Lord
[2:15:53] father we know that your word says that
[2:15:55] let this mind that was in Christ Jesus
[2:15:58] be also in you father Lord as a man
[2:16:01] thinketh in his heart so is he father we
[2:16:04] pray that you would change our hearts
[2:16:06] that we would think like you father Lord
[2:16:08] that your mind would take over our very
[2:16:11] lives and Lord we would look at
[2:16:13] everything in our lives through a
[2:16:15] different perspective Lord through the
[2:16:16] way that you want on us to father
[2:16:19] because we know if we can do that then
[2:16:21] you will have complete control and
[2:16:23] father many of the Earthly situations
[2:16:26] will begin to dissipate we have the
[2:16:28] ability to change the atmosphere in our
[2:16:31] homes to change the atmosphere in our
[2:16:33] families to change the atmosphere in our
[2:16:36] church father if we're willing to just
[2:16:38] take you at your word father I pray that
[2:16:40] you would just have the preeminence in
[2:16:42] our lives Lord as we worship you father
[2:16:45] receive our worship be pleased with the
[2:16:47] word words that you hear and father more
[2:16:49] than the words or the music father be
[2:16:51] pleased with the hearts father as you
[2:16:53] search the Reigns of our hearts Lord we
[2:16:56] know that you look beyond the flesh
[2:16:58] father let it not be lip service unto
[2:17:00] you but let it be true worship from your
[2:17:03] very throne in our heart Lord father we
[2:17:06] pray that you would just inhabit the
[2:17:07] praise as we go forwards tonight we love
[2:17:10] you and we thank you we pray that you
[2:17:11] would restore the strength to our
[2:17:13] brother father that you would just give
