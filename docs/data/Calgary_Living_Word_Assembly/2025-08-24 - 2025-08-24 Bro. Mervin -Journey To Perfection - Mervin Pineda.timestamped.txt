[50:47] me to to greet the saints from the
[50:50] saints of Weldon. Amen. And uh we're
[50:53] glad uh we can be in uh uh of of his
[50:57] service here.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm kind of nervous. You know how
[51:01] it goes uh when someone or to be here is
[51:05] not easy.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; But if the Lord will uh take over then
[51:09] all these nerves will will be settled.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful unto the Lord.
[51:15] Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Uh let's go with the first slide,
[51:19] brother. Uh while you're standing,
[51:23] uh second Peter
[51:25] 1 chapter uh chapter 5 to8.
[51:29] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[51:33] add to your faith virtue,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; and to virtue knowledge, and to
[51:39] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[51:42] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[51:46] to godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[51:49] brotherly kindness, charity. For if
[51:53] these things be in you and abound, they
[51:56] make you. You see, we don't stop at
[51:59] seven, right?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; There's always an eight.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; For if these things be in you,
[52:06] but uh there's no ifs, no ends, no buts,
[52:08] right? Once once you have it, you will
[52:10] have it. Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; For if these things be in you and
[52:14] abound, they make you that ye shall
[52:17] neither be barren
[52:19] &gt;&gt; or unfruitful. It means we will
[52:21] reproduce. Amen. We will produce
[52:24] &gt;&gt; in the knowledge which is the union
[52:28] &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts this morning. Oh
[52:33] Lord Jesus, we are so thankful unto you
[52:35] that we can gather here Lord in this
[52:38] last hour Lord to still preach your word
[52:42] in fullness.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord we know time will come they
[52:46] won't even allow these churches Lord to
[52:49] be opened.
[52:51] But we are so glad Lord that we can
[52:53] &gt;&gt; we can still do it because we're still
[52:55] in the process.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; We are still in our journey Lord towards
[53:00] perfection.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful unto you Lord that uh
[53:04] we have this opportunity now. May you
[53:06] bless the reading of the word. May you
[53:08] bless the the whole service in Jesus
[53:11] Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be
[53:13] seated. I'll just check this thing if it
[53:17] works.
[53:19] Oh,
[53:23] looks like it's not working. Yeah. Uh,
[53:27] bear with me here. I'll just
[53:31] I hope it will work. There you go.
[53:40] Anyway, yeah. So, the next uh slide,
[53:43] journey to perfection. I'll just say
[53:45] next slide, brother. So I have a big
[53:48] topic this morning. I hope it's okay
[53:50] with you.
[53:52] It's been a while since I preached. So
[53:55] three months, four months maybe. But I
[53:57] want to to bring the message of the hour
[53:59] in its fullness if we if we can with
[54:01] this one and a half hour or so. And uh
[54:05] bear with me. Uh there are lots of
[54:08] scriptures, lots of notes. But then the
[54:10] thing is at the end of the day or at the
[54:13] end of our journey we will reach our
[54:16] destination
[54:17] &gt;&gt; and that is perfection
[54:20] &gt;&gt; and that's the thing that our
[54:23] Lord Jesus Christ wanted us to achieve.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh but it's not easy to
[54:32] achieve those
[54:33] &gt;&gt; uh the the the basically the stature of
[54:36] a perfect man. You won't be able to
[54:38] achieve that by your own.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a guide. Amen. And uh I I
[54:44] have yeah 35 slides but then I have
[54:48] maybe uh 30 pages of notes but uh but
[54:54] &gt;&gt; I know this cannot be taken in one go
[54:57] but uh we'll try. We'll just summarize
[54:59] so that at least we know where we're
[55:01] standing. Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Next page brother. So the stature of a
[55:06] perfect man. This is always very popular
[55:09] preaching for for for the believers.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:14] Uh and uh it's a good uh foundation so
[55:16] that uh so that we can see how we can
[55:19] attain the stature of a perfect man.
[55:22] Yes.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; But the thing there is we can uh it's
[55:26] not it's not that we don't have all
[55:28] these virtues these virtues that are
[55:31] mentioned in in second Peter but they
[55:34] are already there in us. They already
[55:36] placed in us. The only thing that uh
[55:40] they are what is required of us is to
[55:43] manifest them.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; And how can they be manifested? Through
[55:47] trials and sufferings.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because uh we know
[55:54] maturity being perfect means being
[55:57] matured,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; right? And uh let let's go to the
[56:01] process. It's a process. Amen. But the
[56:04] thing here is it's a process. But we
[56:07] know we are already sealed until the day
[56:09] of our redemption. And we have that seed
[56:11] already. Amen. So the stature of a
[56:13] perfect man, you can see uh they are all
[56:16] blank. And let's start with them. Amen.
[56:22] The first virtue next slide brother. So
[56:27] you you see before it's blank but then
[56:29] through the Holy Spirit
[56:31] &gt;&gt; through the guide himself we will be
[56:34] able to attain that perfection. It's
[56:36] hand in hand. We must be ready to be led
[56:40] so that we can attain all those. We
[56:42] cannot do it ourselves. Amen. So it's
[56:45] through the Holy Spirit which is the
[56:47] guide that will help us attain such
[56:49] stature. Amen. The first one brother
[56:52] faith.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] So faith is the substance of things
[57:00] hoped for the evidence of things not
[57:03] seen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without faith it is impossible
[57:06] to to please God. Amen. So this is the
[57:08] foundation of of of
[57:11] &gt;&gt; uh of the building basically of us. We
[57:15] cannot have faith if we don't have the
[57:18] Holy Ghost.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; So it's that's why the seals brother
[57:22] Brandham is saying it's either you're
[57:24] going or uh coming. It's the same thing,
[57:28] &gt;&gt; right? Because we are sealed until the
[57:30] day of our redemption. All the trials,
[57:32] even Abraham,
[57:35] Amen. when he was tested, he was not he
[57:38] was he was not tested to prove that he
[57:40] has faith. It's just to manifest that he
[57:44] has the faith that is placed in him.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; We should remember that because there is
[57:48] always a question for us. Do I have the
[57:50] Holy Ghost? Do I have the Holy Ghost?
[57:53] Because the thing is when we go to the
[57:55] the stature of a perfect man, all these
[57:56] virtues, when we go to temperance, we
[57:59] cannot even bridle our tongue and then
[58:00] we will say, "Oh, do I have the Holy
[58:02] Ghost?"
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. So this thing is to to solidify our
[58:07] belief our our uh our stature that we
[58:11] have all those virtues placed in us. We
[58:14] have all the potential inside us because
[58:17] we are a seed of God.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; So that's the first foundation. So the
[58:23] first thing you have to lay down is
[58:25] faith because without faith it is
[58:27] impossible to please God. Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And it is the base of the pyramid. Amen.
[58:33] Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; So faith is the base of the pyramid. It
[58:37] is trusting God's word.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Above sense knowledge.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; So you see faith is something that we
[58:45] don't see. But it's a substance. It
[58:47] means it's a it's an it's it exists.
[58:52] Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; A a good illustration for this day is uh
[58:56] a GPS. A GPS will not work for us if we
[59:00] will not blindly follow it. Although of
[59:03] course if we're going to a place where
[59:06] we know then we don't need the GPS. We
[59:08] might put it so that you will know what
[59:10] time we will arrive.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; But then the thing is the GPS will give
[59:14] you some detour or whatever right. So
[59:18] you have to trust the GPS blindly so
[59:21] that it will work. Although sometimes we
[59:24] are hardheaded
[59:26] that we will oh this is faster but then
[59:28] when you go there it's
[59:31] &gt;&gt; the end of the road
[59:33] right
[59:34] &gt;&gt; so that is faith we believe in something
[59:36] that we don't see blindly
[59:39] &gt;&gt; because it's the word of God. Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Oh next one brother. Next is virtue.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Oh I hope you you can read it.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:52] Add to your faith virtue meaning adding.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; It's a ladder. All we know that it's a
[59:58] progression. Amen. And that is strength.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And that is courage. Amen. We the bride,
[1:00:07] the church must have virtue to stand.
[1:00:10] Amen. And in Philippians 4:8, if there
[1:00:12] be any virtue and if there be any
[1:00:16] praise, think of these things. Amen.
[1:00:19] Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So this is if I will I'll put an example
[1:00:23] for for virtue is just like the moral
[1:00:24] fiber of a steel.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That allows a bridge to hold.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has the inner strength. We have
[1:00:32] the inner strength. Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And that's virtue. Amen. Oh, God is so
[1:00:37] good. Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Then knowledge.
[1:00:43] Barbana in his message. I got the
[1:00:45] inspiration for uh for the uh you know
[1:00:47] it stature of a perfect man and the
[1:00:49] guide. They go hand in hand.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; They're not separate things because you
[1:00:54] cannot attain this virtues like I've
[1:00:57] said without the Holy Ghost. And you
[1:00:59] cannot be led if you don't have these
[1:01:01] virtues.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; So they are both Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And and we know the purpose is to attain
[1:01:07] maturity. Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God is good. Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Hosea 4:6, my Oh, sorry. Uh
[1:01:16] we're still in uh Oh, we're we're
[1:01:19] already in knowledge. Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; So the the third virtue is knowledge.
[1:01:25] Amen. After virtue, you add to your
[1:01:27] virtue? Knowledge. What knowledge? Baram
[1:01:31] is saying not worldly knowledge.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; But the knowledge of the word,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; the knowledge of his will. When we have
[1:01:37] that knowledge, we know we will have
[1:01:39] wisdom. Uh there there's always a
[1:01:42] question, what's the difference between
[1:01:44] knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is what
[1:01:47] you know. Amen. But wisdom is the
[1:01:50] ability to apply what you know. A good
[1:01:53] example for that is uh having tools. You
[1:01:57] might have all the tools. Amen. All all
[1:01:59] those builders here uh or DIYers like
[1:02:02] me,
[1:02:04] we have all the tools. But if you don't
[1:02:06] know how to to use the tools and when to
[1:02:08] use them, then you don't have wisdom.
[1:02:10] That's why wisdom, how to how to have
[1:02:13] wisdom, right? Uh uh the fear of the
[1:02:17] Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Meaning
[1:02:19] the fear is reverence, reverence to his
[1:02:22] word. Amen. Reverence uh to God. Amen.
[1:02:28] So in Hosea 4:6 actually I so it says
[1:02:33] here my people are destroyed for lack of
[1:02:36] knowledge. We don't want to be destroyed
[1:02:38] brothers and sisters. That's why we need
[1:02:40] to feed on the word. We must have
[1:02:42] knowledge of the word. Amen. Not not we
[1:02:45] we know worldly knowledge is so good
[1:02:47] especially in this day and age just one
[1:02:49] click chat GPT all the AI tools right.
[1:02:52] It's so easy to to to check and and and
[1:02:56] fact check everything but not everything
[1:02:58] that is uh portray or or or being
[1:03:02] searched there are are the truth. So how
[1:03:04] would we know it's the truth? Go back to
[1:03:07] the word.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; When I accepted this message I uh
[1:03:11] because I was in Qatar in in uh in a
[1:03:14] Muslim country and then I have to move
[1:03:16] to Malaysia
[1:03:18] and then there's no church there. the
[1:03:20] the thing that was or or the the advice
[1:03:24] that uh was given to me is until now I
[1:03:27] still keep it. If you have some doubts
[1:03:30] because you don't have anyone to ask,
[1:03:33] just go back to the source which is the
[1:03:34] Bible and the message of the hour.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Right? You might have someone that you
[1:03:39] have uh confidence with. No problem. But
[1:03:42] then the thing make sure that that
[1:03:44] person is giving you advice according to
[1:03:46] the word,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; according to the knowledge of the word.
[1:03:49] Because the thing is we're all humans.
[1:03:50] Amen. That's why we are given this
[1:03:54] message of the hour in this little phone
[1:03:56] here so that we can check whether what
[1:03:58] I'm saying is true.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; What the ministers are saying is true.
[1:04:03] Amen. Knowledge of the word. Amen.
[1:04:06] Amen. Are we okay? Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; The next is temperance.
[1:04:12] Add temperance. Add to your knowledge
[1:04:14] temperance. So what is temperance?
[1:04:17] That's how to control your tongue.
[1:04:20] How to control your eating, your
[1:04:22] drinking, your passions. Amen. Isn't
[1:04:24] that important? We're all guilty.
[1:04:27] Temperance. That's why. But the thing
[1:04:28] there is we might not be able to bridle
[1:04:31] our tongue, but then the thing is it
[1:04:33] doesn't mean that you don't have
[1:04:34] temperance. It's just not manifesting
[1:04:36] yet.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't worry. We have the Holy
[1:04:40] Ghost since we believe.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are sealed until the day of
[1:04:45] our redemption. Do so we don't need to
[1:04:47] worry. The purpose of the five-fold
[1:04:48] ministry is to perfect
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; one one of the purposes, right? Is to
[1:04:53] perfect the saints. Perfection means to
[1:04:56] be matured.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that God, the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:00] can marry us.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Because all these things, right? The
[1:05:06] message of the hour is about the book of
[1:05:08] redemption is about the marriage between
[1:05:12] the bride and the bridegroom. Amen. It's
[1:05:14] a marriage love affair. Amen. And uh we
[1:05:18] we have those topics. Amen. And uh I'm
[1:05:20] glad we are only 15 minutes here. Thank
[1:05:22] you, Bra Paul. You gave me a an early uh
[1:05:25] uh uh time here. More time. Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; So, Proverbs 25:28. We know uh I'm just
[1:05:34] reminding you brothers and sisters,
[1:05:36] right? We we all know this. But then the
[1:05:38] thing is we need to be reminded.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need to fill our cup
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; until it becomes full, until it runs
[1:05:46] over. if we can right so that when we
[1:05:48] run over then we can share it.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Because you cannot share something that
[1:05:52] you lack.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We cannot share something that we don't
[1:05:56] have. That's why we keep feeding the the
[1:05:58] the that the 10 virgins. Five are they
[1:06:02] just have enough. So they cannot share
[1:06:05] it to the foolish virgins. But for us
[1:06:07] now we have overflowing
[1:06:09] uh oil which is the Holy Ghost which is
[1:06:12] the word. That's why we are commanded to
[1:06:15] prophesy again. Prophesy again means to
[1:06:19] to preach the gospel again because it
[1:06:21] was already preached before. That's our
[1:06:24] purpose, brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; So, Proverbs 25:28,
[1:06:28] he that hath no rule over his own spirit
[1:06:32] is like a city that is broken down.
[1:06:35] Spirit means is like mind, right? The
[1:06:37] spirit of the mind, the mind of the
[1:06:39] spirit. Because the thing is they are
[1:06:41] inter interchangeable although they are
[1:06:43] different. Amen. There's a figure of
[1:06:45] speech I think chiasmos or whatever they
[1:06:47] call it or or parallel you can
[1:06:49] interchange them because even the bible
[1:06:52] used it the spirit of your mind and the
[1:06:55] mind of the spirit. So the mind we we
[1:06:58] need to control our mind.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; When we control our mind we will be able
[1:07:01] to control our tongue.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So an an illustration for this is
[1:07:07] like brakes in a car. Amen. It prevents
[1:07:12] from disaster. Imagine driving without a
[1:07:15] break.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So temperance keeps the believer
[1:07:19] from spiritual wrecks.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; But uh we're humans. Amen. We have this
[1:07:27] tongue that is really unruly. Right? But
[1:07:30] then
[1:07:31] we we say something. But then the good
[1:07:34] thing with believers,
[1:07:36] you are quick to repent.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the thing. We are quick to
[1:07:41] repent, to ask forgiveness. Amen.
[1:07:42] Because we don't, we didn't mean it.
[1:07:44] Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Next one. Patience.
[1:07:51] Patience with what?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Patience with God's promises.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Waiting for it, not moved, but waiting
[1:08:00] until it is fulfilled. Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Waiting for God's promises. We're
[1:08:05] waiting for God's promises. But then the
[1:08:07] thing is, how can we uh attain those
[1:08:11] promises? We must be aligned with the
[1:08:13] word. We were we were fellowshipping
[1:08:14] with brother Don and uh it's so good
[1:08:17] when for example there's a rain. If you
[1:08:19] want to be poured out with uh poured on
[1:08:22] on that rain, you have to move where the
[1:08:25] rain is because the you know if in
[1:08:27] Calgary it's not raining and in Erdri it
[1:08:29] is raining, you have to go to Erdri.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So that the rain will pour on
[1:08:34] you.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; It means you have to be aligned so that
[1:08:37] the promises you will receive.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; So it means being aligned means you you
[1:08:42] have to move. That's why we are in a
[1:08:44] journey. We're not at standstill here.
[1:08:46] The bride will not keep still
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; for he has said the Lord. We need to
[1:08:51] move. We We are in a journey. There
[1:08:52] might be breaks. There might be stops,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; right? But we need to move after.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And when you're in a journey, when we
[1:09:01] are in a journey, we have to prepare,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Especially if we don't know where to go.
[1:09:06] That's why the importance of a GPS,
[1:09:09] right? Which is faith, which is the Holy
[1:09:11] Spirit himself. It's a revelation. So,
[1:09:14] we need a guide,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; right? And that guide we know that guide
[1:09:18] which is the Holy Spirit he must be with
[1:09:21] you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He must be in us always together. Amen.
[1:09:26] It's not a it's not a guide that uh I
[1:09:28] know remotely now you can guide someone
[1:09:30] to do this and do that right but then
[1:09:32] the thing is the actual guide he's
[1:09:34] present and when you go for a tour for
[1:09:37] example the guide is always you have to
[1:09:39] hear the guide what he's saying
[1:09:41] otherwise you'll be lost. Amen. It's so
[1:09:43] important. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; So James 1:3-4,
[1:09:49] the trying of your faith workketh
[1:09:52] patience.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; So you see all these trials, there's a
[1:09:58] purpose,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; right? It workketh patience. It means
[1:10:00] it's building it's building the stature.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He's not building a wall. He's building
[1:10:06] a house. Amen. Where he can dwell in.
[1:10:09] Amen. So the a good illustration for
[1:10:12] this is a farmer who plant
[1:10:16] seeds a seed who plants a seed he he he
[1:10:20] needs to wait right he needs to water
[1:10:22] the seed
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; and wait for it to grow you cannot just
[1:10:26] force someone oh I have to I have to uh
[1:10:31] uh water it more it will be drowned
[1:10:34] right it it will drown uh oh I I I will
[1:10:38] put artificial son. No, we need we need
[1:10:41] we need to wait until it grows. Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; So, so it's important. So that that is
[1:10:48] patience. Amen. Waiting for the harvest
[1:10:52] because uh that tree when you plant the
[1:10:55] seed, it will bear fruit. Amen. But in
[1:10:58] his own time, in his time. Amen. We
[1:11:01] cannot we cannot force it. Amen. And the
[1:11:04] important of planting a seed you know
[1:11:06] you have to put it under the soil right
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; and that soil is you can say that's a
[1:11:12] dirty that's dirt right so we need dirt
[1:11:15] also to grow amen you see the dirt of
[1:11:18] the world is so that to prove that we
[1:11:20] are overcomers
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; amen those dirt those dirt are required
[1:11:27] because the seed if it is just
[1:11:30] on the surface
[1:11:32] and it rains and it uh uh and the sun is
[1:11:35] there. It can be baked and it it will
[1:11:37] just die
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; but then you have to cover it with the
[1:11:40] soil.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; So it means so that it can overcome.
[1:11:42] Amen. And uh and it's important
[1:11:46] sometimes we for for children we are we
[1:11:50] accept that oh they're young right so we
[1:11:54] have to wait and then just feed them
[1:11:55] cerillac or whatever whatever baby food
[1:11:59] right until they grow right and then uh
[1:12:02] so we we get that it's young it's it's
[1:12:05] it's an infant it's it's a child but
[1:12:08] then spiritually sometimes we don't have
[1:12:10] patience
[1:12:12] for our Brothers and sisters, why can't
[1:12:14] he get that? Why can't he get this
[1:12:17] revelation? You cannot impart something,
[1:12:21] right? Uh or you cannot force something
[1:12:23] when he's not yet ready.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; We have to patiently wait upon the Lord.
[1:12:28] Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And then godliness.
[1:12:36] What is godliness?
[1:12:39] Godliness means to be like God,
[1:12:42] reverent, walking in his character.
[1:12:45] Amen. So 1 Timothy 6:6, but godliness
[1:12:49] with contentment is great gain. Amen.
[1:12:54] So uh an an illustration for this is
[1:12:58] just like a child. I have a son, Miles.
[1:13:01] So the thing is he's my reflection, you
[1:13:05] can say, because he's uh he's part of
[1:13:06] me. Amen. And we are the same. We are
[1:13:08] sons and daughters. Amen. Of of of God.
[1:13:11] But then we need to be adopted. We need
[1:13:13] to be matured so that we can be adopted.
[1:13:17] It's just like uh for me assuming I have
[1:13:21] a good estate. If Miles is not ready,
[1:13:24] how can I let him inherit my estate
[1:13:28] without being trained? Right? So
[1:13:31] assuming I have a good estate, but I
[1:13:34] just claim it will be. Yeah. Amen. Same
[1:13:36] for you, right? Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Although this will all perish by the
[1:13:41] way,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; right? Because that's not the real
[1:13:43] purpose.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Although if God will prosper us here on
[1:13:46] earth, praise the Lord. Why not? Abraham
[1:13:48] was uh was rich, right? Uh Solomon was
[1:13:52] rich.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; But but then the thing is that's the
[1:13:55] that's not the main point. Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Our main point is perfection.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The next one is brotherly
[1:14:03] kindness. Oh, this one is a good one
[1:14:05] actually.
[1:14:07] Brotherly kindness is to forgive your
[1:14:10] brother or sister.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Even when he has done you wrong.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; sometimes it's difficult because we're
[1:14:18] still in this flesh.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; But then the thing is, as we have said,
[1:14:22] we cannot do this by our own. We need
[1:14:24] the guide, the Holy Spirit, so that we
[1:14:26] can attain this. Amen. John 13:35 But
[1:14:29] this shall all men know that ye are my
[1:14:32] disciples if what? If you have love one
[1:14:37] to another. Amen. And that is brotherly
[1:14:40] kindness. Amen. Oh, we can.
[1:14:45] So after this you can see
[1:14:48] these are all the seven virtues you can
[1:14:51] say before the last one can come down
[1:14:55] which is love. Amen. The next slide,
[1:14:58] brother. And we need so the Holy Spirit
[1:15:01] like we like what we said.
[1:15:06] This is the body. This is the head, the
[1:15:10] capstone which is love, which is Jesus
[1:15:12] himself.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; He can only come down if we have already
[1:15:16] attained this. That means we are already
[1:15:18] matured and attained perfection. Amen.
[1:15:21] But it's difficult. But then the thing
[1:15:23] is with God everything is possible. It's
[1:15:25] not by our own might, our own
[1:15:26] understanding. Right?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And that's why you can see the next
[1:15:31] slide there.
[1:15:34] These are all the the mysteries we can
[1:15:36] we can see that uh through the me
[1:15:39] through the preaching of the message of
[1:15:41] the hour through a vindicated prophet.
[1:15:42] And now in the bride we we know that uh
[1:15:45] we have the seven church ages. We have
[1:15:47] the seven uh messengers. We come from
[1:15:50] the dark ages, rotten seed, stock,
[1:15:52] tassel, shock and to become matured
[1:15:54] seed. This is all process. Amen. And we
[1:15:57] we go through a process of
[1:15:58] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:16:01] of the Holy Ghost. So that what we can
[1:16:02] leave the full word after, right? Which
[1:16:05] is what which is Jesus Christ himself.
[1:16:08] And we are living in the bride age. We
[1:16:10] know that we are we know this is out
[1:16:12] there. But then we are given this uh
[1:16:14] this message that we are the bride.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have changed dispensation from
[1:16:19] being a denomination
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; to a uh to a normal church, nominal
[1:16:23] church to a capital C church which is
[1:16:26] the bride and then later on we'll become
[1:16:28] wife and we will live together.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a process. Amen. That's
[1:16:32] why I'm just showing all this and then
[1:16:35] at the end of this when he comes down
[1:16:39] the next slide brother you will see it's
[1:16:41] one whole pyramid.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; It's one whole thing. the head being
[1:16:46] Christ and us being the body. There's no
[1:16:48] more mortar in between because it's
[1:16:51] already part. There's a oneness,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; right, of God in the bride. And what's
[1:16:58] that purpose? So that we can go to Eden
[1:17:00] condition again,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; perfect
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; eternity. Amen. So that's why we need to
[1:17:08] know when you can see we always say that
[1:17:11] there should not be anything between the
[1:17:14] body and the head.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; So it means the shape of this body must
[1:17:20] fit the shape of the head.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; So that there will be no uh leak you can
[1:17:26] say if you're
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; in a in a rocket if there's leak. I
[1:17:31] think uh his uh uh uh brother uh
[1:17:34] Constantine here is in the aerospace or
[1:17:36] whatever. If there is a leak, it will
[1:17:38] not fly. It will just explode in midair.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So that's why this whole thing so that
[1:17:42] it can fly which is which is the rapture
[1:17:45] that we're waiting.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; We need to be shaped.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need pressure at the bottom
[1:17:53] so that we can go up.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And those pressures will make us attain
[1:17:58] all these virtues. Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; So don't worry when there are trials and
[1:18:04] sufferings that we
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; that we experience here. It means we are
[1:18:09] maturing. We are growing.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; We need the guide brothers and sisters
[1:18:18] to to attain this to attain this
[1:18:21] stature. Amen.
[1:18:23] God is good. Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[1:18:28] So the guide
[1:18:30] in in in the message the guide by
[1:18:32] brother Braham the guide is the Holy
[1:18:34] Spirit.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; He knows the way.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; We don't.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We might presume we know the way
[1:18:43] but then we will make mistakes if that's
[1:18:46] not the right road.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; So there's a chance 50/50 that it's
[1:18:49] correct. It's either right or wrong.
[1:18:51] Right. So but then the thing is if you
[1:18:52] take the wrong road, go back where you
[1:18:56] came from and then take the right road.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. As simple as that. Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Because for as many as are led by the
[1:19:04] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[1:19:08] Amen. Romans 8:14. Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; So, a blind man needs a guide dog,
[1:19:14] right?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; So, what the believer
[1:19:18] What does the believer need? We need to
[1:19:21] yield. A believer must need to yield to
[1:19:24] the spirit's leadership. That's the key.
[1:19:26] Yield.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Surrender. Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Right? Because you cannot be led if you
[1:19:30] don't surrender. Right? That's why I
[1:19:32] think it's Brier Ken who preached you
[1:19:34] kick a dead man, he will not fight back.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; So we need to be dead to ourselves so
[1:19:40] that we can be led. Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; So So why we need a guide? Because he
[1:19:45] knows the dangers,
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; right? He knows the pitfalls.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; He knows the traps
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; and we need to have a guide. Amen. So
[1:19:54] mountain climbers, you know, I think uh
[1:19:56] brother Bry uh shared a testimony here.
[1:20:00] We we we need we need a guide. Amen. So
[1:20:02] that we know where we we're going.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] Sometimes uh when we think that we know
[1:20:08] that's that's the time we will be in
[1:20:10] danger. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So how the guide operates?
[1:20:15] So the guide always points to the word.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; He doesn't talk about himself. So the
[1:20:22] Holy Spirit will lead us always to the
[1:20:25] word. Amen. If it's not the word, then
[1:20:28] it's not a right guide. There are so
[1:20:29] many false guides. Amen. Especially in
[1:20:32] this message as well. Especially
[1:20:34] Especially outside of this message,
[1:20:35] right? Imagine even in this message,
[1:20:37] there are so many guides that are not uh
[1:20:39] that are false. Imagine outside of this
[1:20:42] message. By the way, the message for for
[1:20:45] simplicity is Christ in us, the hope of
[1:20:47] glory,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; right? And when Christ is in us,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; we can be led.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Right. And we we will reach our
[1:20:54] destination.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; So there's a warning.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; If we will not uh uh follow the guide,
[1:21:03] right? And if we refuse to the guide and
[1:21:06] uh it's actually in Proverbs uh 124:28,
[1:21:10] if you turn him away, there will come a
[1:21:13] time when you're when you will call and
[1:21:15] he will not answer. So there's still a
[1:21:18] point of no return.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Because the thing is if you are
[1:21:21] given a lot of chances and you still
[1:21:23] don't uh uh don't hed
[1:21:27] one one day,
[1:21:29] right? When you try to call, he will not
[1:21:32] answer. So yeah, but for us we know we
[1:21:36] we we must make a decision. Amen. That
[1:21:38] we need to once we make a decision, we
[1:21:41] need to follow the guide completely.
[1:21:43] Amen.
[1:21:44] That's in Proverbs 124 20
[1:21:48] uh Proverbs 124-28.
[1:21:52] Uh the 28 I'll just read the 28. Then
[1:21:54] shall they call upon me but I will not
[1:21:57] answer. They shall seek me early but
[1:22:00] they shall not find me. So you see while
[1:22:03] he's there while he's uh uh uh con uh
[1:22:08] convicting you when you do something
[1:22:10] wrong follow him. It means he's still
[1:22:12] calling. He's still uh forgiving. Amen.
[1:22:15] But uh when when our hearts are already
[1:22:18] hardened and we don't even recognize
[1:22:20] that there is God, then that that's the
[1:22:22] trouble. Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; So you see the goal for this stature of
[1:22:29] a perfect man is to be rapture ready.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; A character that is rapture ready. Amen.
[1:22:35] Yes.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; So you can see
[1:22:40] just to uh
[1:22:42] to finalize this uh stature of a perfect
[1:22:44] man, I have a I have a a topic here of
[1:22:48] the pressing of Gethsemane.
[1:22:51] So the virtues of Christ, I think I I I
[1:22:54] preach about Gethsemane during I think
[1:22:57] two years ago regarding uh Easter
[1:23:00] because Gethsemane is an oil press.
[1:23:04] It means it's an oil press right uh and
[1:23:06] and the virtues of Christ are not
[1:23:08] something we try to create by our own
[1:23:10] effort right so these virtues we cannot
[1:23:14] create them right they already placed
[1:23:17] within us by the holy spirit as I've
[1:23:20] said earlier but just like fruit it must
[1:23:24] be pressed so that the juice can come
[1:23:27] come out
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; right it it's the same as in Gethsemane
[1:23:32] the in in Gethsemane God or Jesus was
[1:23:36] pressed so that his uh life the the
[1:23:40] eternal life that he he will impart to
[1:23:42] us it will come out right that's that's
[1:23:45] the oil he wanted to to to come out from
[1:23:48] him from his trials and sufferings he he
[1:23:50] he said here uh uh the fruit must be
[1:23:55] pressed before the sweetness of the
[1:23:57] juice is tasted or olives must be
[1:24:01] crushed in the Gethsemane which is uh
[1:24:04] which means oil press. So must our lives
[1:24:07] go through trials to bring forth what
[1:24:10] God has already planted. So God is the
[1:24:13] one that plants
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; right? But then you know uh we need to
[1:24:18] be tried and tested so that we can have
[1:24:20] it. And Paul said in uh
[1:24:25] Paul said in Romans 5:3 and4, "We glory
[1:24:28] in tribulation
[1:24:32] knowing that tribulation workketh
[1:24:34] patience."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And patience experience
[1:24:39] and experience hope. So the pressing the
[1:24:43] pressing or the trials is not to prove
[1:24:45] whether we have patience or love or
[1:24:48] faith all all these virtues but to
[1:24:51] develop and manifest those virtues.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without pressure
[1:24:57] oil remains hidden within the olive
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; right
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; without trial the character of Christ
[1:25:05] remains hidden within us. So don't worry
[1:25:09] about trials and sufferings. It's a it's
[1:25:11] part of our journey. Amen. And even in
[1:25:14] Matthew 26:39-36
[1:25:17] when uh when the Lord Jesus Christ uh
[1:25:19] entered Gethsemane
[1:25:21] under the weight of sorrow, sorrow and
[1:25:23] agony, the true oil of surrender was
[1:25:26] pressed out as he prayed. Not as I will,
[1:25:29] but as thou wilt.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he fully surrendered. Amen. In
[1:25:35] that crushing, the life of perfect
[1:25:37] obedience and submission to the father
[1:25:39] shone forth. Amen. Oh, what a beautiful
[1:25:43] reality, brothers and sisters. Amen. So,
[1:25:46] but here is the key. We cannot walk
[1:25:48] through our Gethsemane in our own
[1:25:50] strength.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Right? We can only manifest this virtues
[1:25:55] when we yield ourselves to the guide
[1:25:57] which is the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth comes, he will
[1:26:02] guide us in all truth. Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Without the guide, Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; pressure breaks a man.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; So imagine because you're doing it by
[1:26:13] our own.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; But with the guide, pressure will refine
[1:26:18] a man.
[1:26:20] It's a it's a different perspective.
[1:26:22] That's why we are in the end time
[1:26:24] evangelism, brothers and sisters. It's
[1:26:26] honing time. We we are already shaped
[1:26:29] almost in his image. But we need to to
[1:26:32] check all those uh improper shapes.
[1:26:35] Amen. Uh improper characters. Amen.
[1:26:37] That's why we are being tried and tested
[1:26:39] so that the character of Jesus Christ
[1:26:42] himself will manifest in us. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy this morning?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the to the preaching now, I
[1:26:52] guess. Next slide, brother. So
[1:26:57] the message of the hour it has a lot of
[1:27:00] mysteries that we call them history
[1:27:02] already because they are already
[1:27:04] revealed and uh when I searched the
[1:27:06] message and and checked I found around
[1:27:10] 90 but there are more right but then uh
[1:27:13] I don't think we can take them all but
[1:27:15] uh I I'll give a summary so that we so
[1:27:18] that we can explain or discuss why do we
[1:27:21] believe what we believe right why do we
[1:27:24] Why do we uh believe the message of the
[1:27:26] hour? Why do we believe that God sent a
[1:27:29] prophet, right? Because for us, it's the
[1:27:32] manifestation of the word through us,
[1:27:35] through the vindicated prophet and then
[1:27:37] now us. And we cannot even attain
[1:27:39] maturity and perfection without knowing
[1:27:41] all this,
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; right? Although they already revealed,
[1:27:44] but then for for many because like I've
[1:27:47] said a while ago, we are in a journey.
[1:27:50] Some are already very close to the
[1:27:51] finish line, but some are just starting.
[1:27:54] But the journey brothers and sisters is
[1:27:57] a personal journey.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; We cannot carry someone's someone else's
[1:28:02] burden. The only thing we can do is if
[1:28:04] we stumble, we can we can uh encourage
[1:28:07] him. Stand up and move. We cannot just
[1:28:10] carry. We have the same destination
[1:28:12] brothers and sisters. We know some are
[1:28:14] already 40 50 years in the message. Some
[1:28:16] are already not yet in the message. Some
[1:28:18] are just start starting. But then the
[1:28:20] thing is we are in a journey. So it
[1:28:22] means we we must never underestimate the
[1:28:26] planting of seed of uh of of God in our
[1:28:29] heart so that it can grow. Amen. And
[1:28:31] that's why we need maturity and
[1:28:33] perfection and through the preaching of
[1:28:35] the word through the message of the hour
[1:28:37] with all these mysteries
[1:28:40] that are revealed then it will turn our
[1:28:43] hearts
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; back to the faith of the original
[1:28:45] father. Amen. Next slide brother and
[1:28:47] then we can read
[1:28:50] Malachi 456.
[1:28:52] These are we know all this. Amen. Right.
[1:28:55] Most of us.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; But then the thing is uh it's just like
[1:28:59] we have so much flowers but then a
[1:29:02] minister will put it in a bouquet
[1:29:04] different from another minister. That's
[1:29:06] why we have different types of h
[1:29:08] different administrations of gifts.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can give a three roses or or
[1:29:13] whatever or uh bra can give seven or
[1:29:16] whatever or 12 but they are all roses
[1:29:18] but then the thing is it's just like
[1:29:20] also cooking we have the same
[1:29:22] ingredients but the way you cook will
[1:29:24] will turn out to be a different taste
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; and we need all those that's why the the
[1:29:29] reason we have the five-fold ministry is
[1:29:31] so that we can uh we can be perfected
[1:29:34] amen we can
[1:29:37] amen we can be edified amen strengthened
[1:29:41] end. Amen. In faith. Amen.
[1:29:44] So, behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:29:46] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:29:49] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[1:29:51] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[1:29:52] the children and the heart of the
[1:29:54] children to their fathers. So, you can
[1:29:56] see here this is not all brother Brham.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just scrutinize because
[1:30:03] sometimes we say 456 is all brother
[1:30:05] Branham. No, I we know Malachi 3 is John
[1:30:07] the Baptist but Malachi 4 is not all
[1:30:09] braham. Let's just Are we okay? Amen. We
[1:30:14] we we'll just uh break it down. I will
[1:30:17] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:30:18] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:30:20] the the Lord.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; The first coming of Jesus Christ who was
[1:30:24] his uh uh uh what what do you call it?
[1:30:29] Forerunner.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist. Is that great?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; But is it dreadful?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Not yet. Right? So it means great and
[1:30:42] dreadful. So it means the great day of
[1:30:46] the Lord was forun by John the Baptist.
[1:30:49] But the dreadful day of the Lord also
[1:30:52] same Elijah which is Elijah's spirit
[1:30:55] because but John the Baptist is third
[1:30:57] coming of Elijah and fourth coming of
[1:30:59] Elijah is Branam which is the prophet of
[1:31:02] Malachi 4
[1:31:04] and the revelations 10:7 he
[1:31:08] right he will be sent to to whom to you
[1:31:12] to us the bride
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; only for the bride. Amen. Because the
[1:31:18] fifth coming of Elijah is for
[1:31:19] Revelations 11. That's for the Jews.
[1:31:21] Then it means we already out. So we must
[1:31:23] know that's why the I'm I'm I'm tackling
[1:31:27] the message of the hour in its fullness
[1:31:28] now. Although it can be taken by many
[1:31:31] ministers after because Yeah. Good thing
[1:31:34] we have we have more hour. Amen. So he
[1:31:39] sh So you see here, he shall turn the
[1:31:41] heart of the fathers to the children.
[1:31:43] Again, that's John the Baptist.
[1:31:46] Amen. And the heart of the children to
[1:31:49] their fathers. That's braham. Turn the
[1:31:52] hearts of the children of this age back
[1:31:54] to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:31:57] Pure word. Back to the pure word. Amen.
[1:32:01] Or else or lest I come and smite the
[1:32:04] earth with a curse.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next slide, brother.
[1:32:10] Revelations 10:7.
[1:32:12] So we're talking about the mysteries
[1:32:14] through the me through the prophetic
[1:32:16] ministry of our vindicated prophet and
[1:32:20] now it is being manifested to us and we
[1:32:23] are doing it prophesying again. We
[1:32:26] cannot just sit in our church and then
[1:32:28] say oh I I got all this revelation and
[1:32:32] then we I'll be here. I will I will just
[1:32:34] eat eat and then you don't share.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; What will happen to you if you eat eat
[1:32:38] and then you don't exercise? You don't
[1:32:39] uh you you don't go and uh go out and
[1:32:42] move.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; So it will not vertically growing,
[1:32:46] right? It will be horizontal growing,
[1:32:49] right? So when we feed, we need to
[1:32:52] share.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Also, right? So you see, but in the days
[1:32:56] of the voice of the seventh angel, which
[1:32:59] is brother Brham,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; the the seventh messenger of Laiia, the
[1:33:06] seventh church age, when he shall begin
[1:33:09] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:33:13] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:33:15] servants the prophets. Amen. Oh, that
[1:33:18] one I I don't even need to explain
[1:33:20] because we know it. But we know that the
[1:33:23] the the the prophet of Malach Let let's
[1:33:27] just continue I guess. Yeah. Next slide,
[1:33:29] brother. So now this messenger of
[1:33:32] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going
[1:33:36] to do two things according to Malachi 4.
[1:33:39] He will turn the hearts of the children
[1:33:40] to fathers. That's what we broken broken
[1:33:43] down, right? And then two, he will
[1:33:45] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:33:47] thunders in Revelation 10.
[1:33:51] And what are those re uh uh thunders
[1:33:54] which are the revelations contained in
[1:33:56] the seven seals?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; It will be this divinely revealed
[1:34:02] mystery truths
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; that literally literally
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; not spiritually
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; literally Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:34:14] Pentecostal fathers.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Oh exactly. So he said, "Right."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:34:23] now we got the we're getting
[1:34:27] we're getting there. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Next slide is just a summary. I don't
[1:34:31] know if you want to tackle this today.
[1:34:34] And then there's another page. It will
[1:34:36] be 19 pages, right? 19 mysteries. They
[1:34:40] are just the main ones. So let's just
[1:34:43] tackle them little by little so that at
[1:34:44] least you can have and then go back and
[1:34:46] then you you will have your first love
[1:34:48] again.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; When you accepted this message, you're
[1:34:51] just like a lion,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; right? You want you don't want to work
[1:34:54] anymore because you know you're
[1:34:55] thinking, "Oh, God is coming tomorrow."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Are we in that stage right now, brothers
[1:35:00] and sisters? I'm guilty. Uh I'm my wife
[1:35:03] would know.
[1:35:06] I'm guilty. Oh, because the the cares of
[1:35:08] this world sometimes we are sidetracked.
[1:35:11] But then he knew when I accepted the
[1:35:13] message, I didn't want to work. But I
[1:35:15] have to feed the young Miles and Lynn
[1:35:17] and and and her, right? So I have I have
[1:35:20] to go back to work.
[1:35:24] That's right.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; If we can only think, oh, God is coming
[1:35:27] tomorrow. I will not send my children to
[1:35:30] school. No.
[1:35:33] Brham is clear. Ho your potato even
[1:35:36] though it's coming tomorrow. Right.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Plant your potatoes. Amen. Although he's
[1:35:41] coming in a 100 years. Who would know?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; There's still people coming.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Do you think Mercy City is over?
[1:35:47] Impossible. He's still calling.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to preach this,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; right? We need to go back to our first
[1:35:55] love which is the word full. Amen. And
[1:35:57] and when when we accepted this message,
[1:36:00] all this mystery, oh wow,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; how can a seventh grade education uh
[1:36:05] person explain this? It's impossible.
[1:36:08] Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It's without the Holy Spirit in him,
[1:36:11] without God in him, he will not be able
[1:36:13] to do that.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Oh brother.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So you can see
[1:36:25] these mysteries we know
[1:36:28] they are history.
[1:36:30] Why? Why they are history? They are
[1:36:32] revealed already.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then the thing is we know what
[1:36:36] their applications are. That's why we
[1:36:38] preach them. Amen. It's not I will say,
[1:36:41] "Oh, this is a big one. This is a
[1:36:44] mystery. I was able to uh to decipher
[1:36:47] it, right? It it got busted and oh, I
[1:36:50] know what it means." No, it's already
[1:36:53] revealed to the prophet. And now when
[1:36:54] it's revealed to us, check the message.
[1:36:56] It's already revealed in him. He's just
[1:36:59] we're just prophesying again because he
[1:37:01] already prophesied even before, right?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; So the first one Christ is the mystery
[1:37:07] of God revealed.
[1:37:10] So this uh there are three verses here
[1:37:13] summarized only Colossians 1:26-27.
[1:37:17] Even the mystery which had been hid from
[1:37:19] ages and from generations, but now is
[1:37:22] made manifest to his saints. Who are the
[1:37:25] saints? The bride. Amen. Who will become
[1:37:28] wife later on, right? To whom God would
[1:37:31] make known what is the riches of the
[1:37:34] glory of this mystery among the
[1:37:36] Gentiles. It's not for the Jews. It's
[1:37:39] the Gentiles. We know we have discussion
[1:37:41] about Gentiles and Jews. Gentiles means
[1:37:43] it's come uh it's a nation. Heen
[1:37:46] something like that. So, but then the
[1:37:48] thing is before the Jews came there's
[1:37:50] they are all nations because uh the
[1:37:52] being a Jew it means you're an
[1:37:53] Israelite, right? you you are a
[1:37:56] descendant of Judah basically uh that's
[1:37:59] the Jew basically but then the thing is
[1:38:02] right now in the context of New
[1:38:04] Testament right the Gentiles anyone that
[1:38:07] is not a Jew is a Gentile
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; and we are Gentiles amen because we are
[1:38:12] hybrid
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; we got mixed
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; so to whom God would make known to whom
[1:38:21] to to whom that's the same to us Amen
[1:38:24] And what is to whom would make known
[1:38:28] what's the riches of the glory of this
[1:38:29] mystery among the Gentiles which is what
[1:38:32] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[1:38:34] the mystery Christ is the mystery of God
[1:38:36] revealed and in Ephesians 3 3-6 how that
[1:38:41] by revelation he made known unto me the
[1:38:43] mystery that the Gentiles should be
[1:38:46] fellow heirs
[1:38:49] and of the same body and partakers of
[1:38:52] his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[1:38:54] Aren't you happy?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Israel was blinded for in part for a
[1:38:59] season, right?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; So that the fullness of Gentiles can
[1:39:03] come. That's the main thing. And and and
[1:39:06] we're so glad that they were blinded.
[1:39:08] But doesn't mean they were lost. They
[1:39:10] are lost. No, they're not lost. It's
[1:39:12] just for the last predestinated seed to
[1:39:14] come in. How long would that because I
[1:39:18] know one of the mysteries here is the
[1:39:19] the 70 weeks of Daniel and he's not
[1:39:22] counting our dates because his time
[1:39:26] piece is the the Israelites. That's not
[1:39:29] our whole topic. But then the thing is I
[1:39:30] preach that the thing there is he
[1:39:32] doesn't count whether it will be one day
[1:39:35] or 10,000 years from now. He doesn't
[1:39:38] count that. He only counts the the
[1:39:41] number or or or the timing for the Jews.
[1:39:44] Yes,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; the Jews is God God's time piece. That's
[1:39:47] why we're still living in grace.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Old Testament, they're
[1:39:52] living in law. But now in the New
[1:39:53] Testament, when Jesus Christ came, we're
[1:39:55] living in grace. It's not even grace.
[1:39:57] It's double grace. Grace. Grace. That's
[1:39:59] why we must have grace, brothers and
[1:40:01] sisters.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; We must provoke unto love to everyone
[1:40:05] that we will meet. Our colleagues, our
[1:40:07] clients, our customers, our co
[1:40:10] co-workers, everyone that we will meet,
[1:40:13] right? We must manifest him so that they
[1:40:15] will see Christ in us. That's we are
[1:40:18] only we are the their only hope.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Right. We are the hope of this
[1:40:22] generation. Brothers and sisters. Oh,
[1:40:25] and 1 Timothy 3:16. I know there are so
[1:40:29] many. If I'll put this, it will be 100
[1:40:31] pages. So, you can just write them if
[1:40:33] you want. And without controversy, great
[1:40:36] is the mystery of godliness.
[1:40:38] God was manifest in flesh, justified in
[1:40:41] the spirit. sin of angels preached unto
[1:40:45] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[1:40:48] received up into glory. So that is the
[1:40:52] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:40:55] Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; So Bar Branham declared that the entire
[1:41:00] Bible was the revelation of Jesus
[1:41:02] Christ.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Hidden in mystery
[1:41:06] but made known at the end time.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; What is a mystery? It's hidden truth but
[1:41:12] it it doesn't mean that it cannot be uh
[1:41:14] unfolded or revealed.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; It's just hidden for not for a for a
[1:41:18] season but in the end time it will be
[1:41:21] revealed and we are so thankful that
[1:41:23] it's revealed. Amen. And we know the God
[1:41:25] that we serve.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] Oh brother Brandham was saying now God's
[1:41:32] great mystery is Christ in you the hope
[1:41:34] of glory. Amen.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He revealed himself in Christ and Christ
[1:41:39] revealed himself in you. That's the
[1:41:41] great mystery. The indwelling of Christ,
[1:41:44] the hope of glory. And then what? We
[1:41:46] will go back to Eden condition again.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the summary of the first
[1:41:50] mystery. Amen. Christ is the mystery of
[1:41:52] God revealed. And the second one is the
[1:41:54] true water baptism. This is the formula.
[1:41:58] This is not even a mystery because when
[1:41:59] you check if you are an hermeneutic, you
[1:42:02] just tie the uh tie Matthew 28:19 and
[1:42:08] acts 2:38, they're talking the same
[1:42:10] thing. One is titles, one is name.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Title and name are different. But then
[1:42:16] when you ask title is a father, son,
[1:42:18] holy ghost, right? But what is the name
[1:42:21] of God?
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Right? And it's a singular name. It's a
[1:42:25] compound name which is the Lord Jesus
[1:42:27] Christ. That's why we need to be
[1:42:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:31] Christ. Not entitles. You can you can
[1:42:33] recite both. I baptize you in the name
[1:42:36] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:42:37] holy spirit which is the lord Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ. That's the complete baptism.
[1:42:42] Amen. So we can see that we're
[1:42:44] following. And in Acts 19:1-5,
[1:42:47] if you are not baptized properly,
[1:42:50] right, when when Paul was at Corinth, he
[1:42:53] he saw believer uh maybe they uh they
[1:42:56] might be believers at that time, but he
[1:42:59] was asked, "Did you receive the Holy
[1:43:01] Ghost since you believe?" No, we haven't
[1:43:03] heard of any Holy Ghost. What What kind
[1:43:04] of baptism were were you baptized? I was
[1:43:06] baptized in the in John's baptism which
[1:43:09] is the uh and and he explained John
[1:43:12] baptized in the uh
[1:43:16] for repentance
[1:43:18] but but the real baptism in Acts 238
[1:43:21] it's so that you can receive the Holy
[1:43:23] Ghost and then they got rebaptized right
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; amen so the the the the the challenge
[1:43:28] for us if those who are not yet baptized
[1:43:31] doesn't matter how many times you'll get
[1:43:33] baptized
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; but you must do it rightly
[1:43:36] do it the right way. Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Right. And and that's the Acts 238 way.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Which is repent
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:43:47] Jesus Christ for the forgiveness or
[1:43:49] remission of sins. And you shall receive
[1:43:51] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; For the promise is unto you and to your
[1:43:56] children,
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; to you, to us and to our children, even
[1:44:02] afar. Right? Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; As many as the Lord God shall call. So
[1:44:07] that's our ministry actually, prophetic
[1:44:09] ministry actually is to spread this
[1:44:11] gospel. Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; So in Acts 4:12, neither is here
[1:44:16] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:44:18] other name under heaven given among men
[1:44:21] whereby we must be saved. There's only
[1:44:23] one name. Amen. His name is the Lord
[1:44:25] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So yeah, we know every
[1:44:29] person in the Bible that was ever
[1:44:31] baptized was baptized in the name
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; is they are not baptized in any title.
[1:44:35] Amen. Are we are you with me brothers
[1:44:39] and sisters?
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Then the third mystery is the seven
[1:44:41] churches.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; The seven church ages. We have a series
[1:44:45] of the seven church ages every Wednesday
[1:44:47] here. That's a mystery
[1:44:52] but got revealed. Amen. and Revelations
[1:44:56] 1:11 saying, "I am Alpha and Omega, the
[1:44:59] first and the last. And what thou
[1:45:01] seeest, write in a book, and send it
[1:45:03] unto the seven churches which are in
[1:45:05] Asia." That's Revelation 111 and 120.
[1:45:09] The mystery of the seven stars which
[1:45:12] thou sawest in my right hand and seven
[1:45:15] con the the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:45:18] The seven stars are the angels angels
[1:45:21] messengers of the seven churches and the
[1:45:24] seven candlesticks which thou soest are
[1:45:27] the seven churches. Amen. And
[1:45:29] Revelations 3:14, "And unto the angel of
[1:45:32] the church of the loudysians, right,
[1:45:33] these things said the Amen, the faithful
[1:45:36] and true witness, the beginning of the
[1:45:38] creation of God."
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Barnam stated that the
[1:45:43] Ludician age was closing, the church
[1:45:45] ages were finished, and the bride was
[1:45:47] being called out. That's why we are
[1:45:49] we're in bride age. Amen. Although
[1:45:52] Ludicia we see out there, it's Laudisa,
[1:45:54] but we are on top of Lauda. We're seeing
[1:45:56] what's going on right now because we
[1:45:58] have the fullness of the word. Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; So that's the seven church ages and
[1:46:04] there's a book on that. So those who who
[1:46:06] haven't read it, it's a beautiful
[1:46:08] history also of the church ages you can
[1:46:10] see and uh there are lot there lots of
[1:46:13] mysteries that got uh revealed there
[1:46:15] like even the godhead and and so on and
[1:46:18] so forth. Amen. And the fourth one is
[1:46:20] the 70 weeks of Daniel.
[1:46:23] So se we can see here uh these are in
[1:46:27] Daniel 9:24 and 9:27
[1:46:30] and as I mentioned a while ago this is
[1:46:33] tied to the blindness of the striates
[1:46:36] right so that we the Gentiles will come
[1:46:39] in and we're so thankful that's the
[1:46:42] grace amen and he was cut in the middle
[1:46:45] of the week when he was here brother
[1:46:47] when Jesus Christ was here he was
[1:46:49] baptized when he he was about 30 years
[1:46:52] old and he has about three and a half
[1:46:54] years of ministry. That's the half of
[1:46:56] the 70th week of Daniel, right? And then
[1:47:00] the dispensation went to the Gentiles
[1:47:04] and we are there until now
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; until the last predestinated seed will
[1:47:09] come in and then it will go back to the
[1:47:12] striites to the Jews the last three and
[1:47:15] a half which is half of the 70th week.
[1:47:18] But we already gone at that time. We are
[1:47:20] already in the married supper we call
[1:47:21] it. I have a I have a diagram for that.
[1:47:24] So is that already revealed?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And is it important? Amen. Because
[1:47:31] it it will solidify our uh it it it will
[1:47:34] have a good foundation. Amen.
[1:47:39] Mystery number five, the seven seals.
[1:47:42] Oh,
[1:47:46] I don't want to read this because this
[1:47:47] will be a one-year teaching, right?
[1:47:50] Barbberry will if we will read it here
[1:47:52] it will be lots right but then just a
[1:47:55] summary here revelations 5:1 and I saw
[1:47:58] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:48:00] throne a book written within and on the
[1:48:02] backside sealed with seven seals in
[1:48:05] revelations 5:1 it is sealed and 61 and
[1:48:09] I saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:48:10] seals so it means it's open right it was
[1:48:13] opened by the lamb because the seals is
[1:48:15] Christ right and I heard as it were the
[1:48:18] noise of a thunder one of the four beast
[1:48:20] saying, "Come and see." And then
[1:48:21] Revelations 8:1, "And when he had opened
[1:48:24] the seventh seal, there was silence in
[1:48:26] heaven
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; for about the space of half an hour."
[1:48:30] Amen. But in the days of the voice,
[1:48:33] Revelations 10:7, in the days of the
[1:48:36] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:48:38] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:48:41] should be finished.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; How? As he had declared to his servants
[1:48:44] the prophets. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; So the the mystery of the seven seals
[1:48:49] brother Brham mentioned it is is about
[1:48:51] the cloud of angel in February 28, 1963,
[1:48:56] right? uh he said he was caught up by
[1:48:59] pyramids of angels and he was caught up
[1:49:02] that's that's the formation of the of
[1:49:04] the cloud and that is being disproved
[1:49:07] but for us we don't even believe uh I
[1:49:10] mean for me personally I didn't even
[1:49:13] know the cloud before but then once uh
[1:49:16] it was uh revealed to me oh praise the
[1:49:18] lord that's uh
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; that's the face of hoffman or face of
[1:49:23] Christ looking at earth on earth. Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; So, we know that the seventh seal is the
[1:49:31] coming of the Lord.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And for some, they're still not revealed
[1:49:36] because brother Brandham mentioned
[1:49:37] clearly it is the coming of the Lord.
[1:49:39] That's what it is. The end of the world,
[1:49:42] the time for the rapture. But then for
[1:49:44] us, if you go beyond the seven seal
[1:49:47] book, right, all the preaching, the
[1:49:51] mysteries that we're talking about,
[1:49:52] right?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; They are revealed. Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I have a diagram later on.
[1:49:58] So the mystery of the seven seals was
[1:50:01] revealed. He said this but the seven
[1:50:04] seal was left in silence for it is the
[1:50:06] great circuit secret. The great circuit
[1:50:09] circuit the great secret hope is coming
[1:50:13] because
[1:50:15] yeah I'll go with the next one. The
[1:50:17] rapture. So at least you you will see
[1:50:19] why why it is already revealed and uh
[1:50:23] we
[1:50:25] so
[1:50:26] remember the the revelation of Jesus uh
[1:50:30] of of brother Brandham is also
[1:50:31] progressive
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; and we are also the same that's the
[1:50:35] reason why we are in a journey to
[1:50:38] perfection we are in a journey to
[1:50:40] maturity same for the prophet of this
[1:50:42] age he also went to that he thought the
[1:50:45] white horse rider is Christ but Then
[1:50:47] later on the the spirit revealed to him
[1:50:50] that it's antichrist all these things.
[1:50:52] So that's why when when we read the
[1:50:54] message read the whole thing
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; right don't just isolate codes and then
[1:50:58] check that oh I I have something that
[1:51:01] will uh will back up what I believe.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; No check the whole thing and check
[1:51:05] whether it is according to the word.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's the the warning to us so that we
[1:51:11] would know that we are in his will.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Because his will is his word. Amen. is
[1:51:16] if everything that we do is according to
[1:51:18] his word.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; So mystery number six, the seven
[1:51:23] thunders and this is Revelations 10:3
[1:51:27] to4 and cried with a live loud voice as
[1:51:30] when a lion roarth.
[1:51:33] And when he cried one cry, when he cried
[1:51:37] one cry, seven thunders uttered their
[1:51:39] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[1:51:43] uttered their voices, I I was about to
[1:51:45] write and I heard a voice from heaven
[1:51:48] saying unto me, seal up those things
[1:51:50] which the seven thunders uttered and
[1:51:52] write them not. They are unwritten,
[1:51:55] right? They are not written because John
[1:51:57] was forbidden to to write and even even
[1:52:00] Daniel was forbidden to seal until the
[1:52:02] end.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; But then the thing is Revelations 10:7
[1:52:05] has already occurred, right? But in the
[1:52:08] voice when his voice right when he shall
[1:52:12] begin to sound the mystery of God shall
[1:52:14] be finished. So it means and he's
[1:52:16] already out of the picture. So are we
[1:52:18] going to wait for him to come back to
[1:52:20] open?
[1:52:21] No. He already opened everything so that
[1:52:24] we can continue.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Right? The Christ in Branham is the
[1:52:27] Christ in us also.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; That's why that mystery, the Christ in
[1:52:31] us, the hope of glory, we're we're just
[1:52:33] continuing.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Barryham identified the seven
[1:52:39] thunders as unwritten mysteries that
[1:52:42] would be revealed to whom? To the bride
[1:52:45] at the end time.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Are we at the end time?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; We know I have a very long uh uh
[1:52:52] presentation on timeline. I will not uh
[1:52:54] let you endure that. But uh the thing is
[1:52:57] uh we know we are in 2025.
[1:53:02] We've been preaching this message since
[1:53:03] what
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; maybe around n after braom right and
[1:53:08] then he even his his uh preaching are
[1:53:11] it's later than you think.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; We are in the end time. That's 1965. 60
[1:53:16] years down the road we're still here.
[1:53:18] Why? Because God is still calling.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; God is still perfecting. He wants us to
[1:53:24] get matured.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those who are already gone, who
[1:53:27] believe this message, they are in glory.
[1:53:29] They're not dead. They're just waiting,
[1:53:31] sleeping.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Imagine brothers and sisters uh uh those
[1:53:37] who after Jesus Christ, they are in the
[1:53:39] New Testament, right? But uh after
[1:53:43] before Jesus Christ uh or I mean after
[1:53:46] Jesus Christ passed away, all those old
[1:53:48] testament saints including the last one
[1:53:50] on the cross, they they went for
[1:53:52] rapture. But then after that, then it's
[1:53:55] in the New Testament, which is now, and
[1:53:58] we are part of that, and we are waiting
[1:54:00] for the fullness.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those who died after Jesus Christ
[1:54:04] died, they're still in the grave.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're just waiting for the
[1:54:09] perfection. They're waiting for the per
[1:54:11] uh for for our perfection.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that it will go to the to the
[1:54:16] Jews and then we'll be raptured. Oh,
[1:54:18] brothers. That's why all these mysteries
[1:54:20] are important to to discuss.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; It will be revealed to the bride at the
[1:54:27] end time.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; These seven thunders and the seven
[1:54:31] thunders was the seven mysterious voices
[1:54:34] sealed up. They were revealed in the
[1:54:37] opening of the seals to the bride. It is
[1:54:39] not written in the book, but it is made
[1:54:42] known by revelation to the elected.
[1:54:46] That's why you can see, isn't it? you
[1:54:48] cannot add uh to the Bible or take away
[1:54:52] from the Bible. How come you're you're
[1:54:53] reading books
[1:54:55] of Braham that uh his voice, right? But
[1:54:59] then the thing is he's pointing us those
[1:55:01] are the unwritten
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; word that will be spoken by a vindicated
[1:55:06] prophet so that it will be explained and
[1:55:08] made alive.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Right? It will manifest through us.
[1:55:12] That's the reason why we believe a
[1:55:14] prophet. That's the reason why we be we
[1:55:16] believe what we believe. Right? So there
[1:55:18] is a supernatural element here. You
[1:55:21] cannot just explain everything by reason
[1:55:23] right we know we we we could be
[1:55:26] intelligent but then the thing is
[1:55:27] there's there will come a point that you
[1:55:29] will say oh this is supernatural you
[1:55:31] cannot explain it right
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; what is required from us is just to
[1:55:36] believe it
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; the seven thunders
[1:55:42] then the rapture number seven imagine
[1:55:44] even the the the number sevenh okay
[1:55:47] completion
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; or translation of the saints is in 1
[1:55:52] Thessalonians 4:16-17
[1:55:55] and 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.
[1:55:58] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:56:00] heaven with a shout, with a voice of the
[1:56:02] archangel, and with the trump of God,
[1:56:04] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:56:07] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:56:09] be caught up together with them in the
[1:56:11] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So
[1:56:12] shall we ever be with the Lord. And then
[1:56:15] the 1 Corinthians 5:51-52. Behold, I
[1:56:18] show you a mystery. We shall not all
[1:56:21] sleep, but we shall be changed.
[1:56:25] Changed,
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; grow, mature to perfection. Amen.
[1:56:32] We need We need change. Amen.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Changed for the good, right? Yeah. In a
[1:56:37] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[1:56:39] the trump at the last trump. I hope he's
[1:56:42] the last trump. Right. He cannot he
[1:56:44] cannot uh yeah cannot be reelected
[1:56:47] anyway. He has already two terms. So
[1:56:49] yeah, he's the last trump for sure
[1:56:51] unless his child will
[1:56:58] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:57:00] shall be raised incorruptible.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; So let's see this. So it is a mystery.
[1:57:09] He he spoke of the translation as a
[1:57:11] hidden mystery but it's now revealed to
[1:57:14] us
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; so that we can be prepared.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The shout is the message right of
[1:57:22] to get the bride together.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; That's the shout. Amen. What's the voice
[1:57:27] is the resurrection of the dead.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; So what is left now? The trump.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a mystery because we
[1:57:33] don't know when exactly but we know it's
[1:57:36] coming.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it's hidden. It is
[1:57:39] the the exact date is hidden but it's
[1:57:41] coming. That's the trump is the call to
[1:57:43] the wedding supper. That's what we are
[1:57:45] waiting for.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; That's why it's still a mystery to
[1:57:48] others. And and and if you check this uh
[1:57:51] with the with the process of the
[1:57:52] rapture, right? It's a shout, it's a
[1:57:55] voice. And the trump the trump is the
[1:57:57] only one that we don't know.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; We know the contents of the trump. But
[1:58:01] then the thing is when exactly is he
[1:58:03] coming?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; We don't know because only the father
[1:58:06] knows.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord does all three when he
[1:58:09] descends. Amen. Oh, that's in the the
[1:58:12] rapture message. Amen. And then the uh
[1:58:14] the number eight, the token.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Exodus 12:13. And the blood. Exodus
[1:58:22] 12:13. Those who are taking notes. And
[1:58:24] the blood shall be to you for a token
[1:58:26] upon the houses where ye are. And when I
[1:58:29] see the blood, I will pass over you.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the plague shall not be upon
[1:58:35] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[1:58:38] of Egypt. Amen. That's that's the token.
[1:58:43] That's their Exodus. Amen. Uh Passover.
[1:58:46] Amen. And Ephesians 4:30.
[1:58:49] And grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby
[1:58:51] ye are sealed until the day of your
[1:58:53] redemption.
[1:58:56] So
[1:58:58] brother Brham he warned the bride to be
[1:59:00] sure that we are sealed.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost before judgment
[1:59:05] strikes. How do we know we are sealed?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do we get into Christ? By one
[1:59:14] baptism.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; We are all baptized into one body,
[1:59:18] right?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, and and we know the formula. repent
[1:59:22] and be baptized and get the Holy Ghost
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; and and continue feeding the word,
[1:59:28] right, for our day continuously. Amen.
[1:59:31] And until we become mature and perfected
[1:59:33] so that God can marry us
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; can we can be in a wedding with him.
[1:59:37] Amen. The token today is what is the
[1:59:42] Holy Ghost.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It's not the chemistry of the blood,
[1:59:46] right? It's the life that is in that
[1:59:48] blood. Amen. The life that was in the
[1:59:51] blood has come back upon the believer
[1:59:53] when he died on the cross
[1:59:55] bloodshed but the life in that blood was
[1:59:59] released which is the holy spirit that
[2:00:00] will be placed in us.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's why he we need death. He needs to
[2:00:05] die so that the life in him will come
[2:00:07] out and then will be given to all of us.
[2:00:10] Amen. Without it without the token the
[2:00:13] wrath of God falls but with it you are
[2:00:16] safe in Christ. He's He's our hiding
[2:00:19] place, right? That Christ is our hiding
[2:00:20] place. Amen. Serpent seat. I need to
[2:00:23] hurry because I have more. The serpent
[2:00:26] seed. We know that that uh
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:15. And I will put enmity
[2:00:32] between thee and the woman, and between
[2:00:34] thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise
[2:00:37] thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
[2:00:39] heel.
[2:00:41] And 2 Corinthians 11:3, but I fear less
[2:00:45] by any means as the serpent begelled if
[2:00:48] Eve through his satility saw your mind
[2:00:52] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[2:00:54] that is in Christ. Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham reminded us that uh
[2:00:59] sa Satan has always injected deception
[2:01:02] into the human race from the beginning.
[2:01:05] Right? Uh he injected deception. It's
[2:01:07] one word off. That's why the original
[2:01:09] sin is unbelief in the word of God and
[2:01:11] then they disobeyed.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not an apple. It was not an
[2:01:16] apricot even. Right? Those are natural
[2:01:19] fruits. It was an act between Eve and
[2:01:22] the serpent.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; I'm putting a summary only because these
[2:01:24] are big teachings and uh preaching. But
[2:01:27] uh at least we know that there are
[2:01:30] almost 20 major mysteries right that has
[2:01:33] been revealed.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that act between Eve and the
[2:01:38] serpent brought forth Cain. He is the
[2:01:41] serpent seed. We just read it. There's
[2:01:44] an enmity between the two seeds. So it
[2:01:46] means the woman has seed, the serpent
[2:01:47] has seed. That's why the the mystery is
[2:01:50] the serpent seed. Amen. And that's why
[2:01:54] Jesus had to come through a virgin
[2:01:56] birth.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Because yeah, in sin we are conceived,
[2:02:00] right? Out of lust, we are conceived.
[2:02:02] All of us,
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; right? We we were not born immaculate
[2:02:07] immaculate conception. No, it's not that
[2:02:09] right. So we need there's there's a
[2:02:11] requirement for a union between a man
[2:02:13] and a woman. But then that's out of
[2:02:15] lust, right? So that's why Jesus came
[2:02:19] right by virgin birth without any union.
[2:02:22] It's all God himself who impregnated
[2:02:25] Mary. He's just an she's just an
[2:02:27] incubator. Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of the serpent seed.
[2:02:31] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; So yeah. Oh, so the the seed, the
[2:02:37] original seed of Christ must not be a
[2:02:39] contaminated one because he's the
[2:02:41] perfect sacrifice. A sacrifice must be
[2:02:43] perfect, blameless. And we we are not
[2:02:46] that. No, no matter how good we are, how
[2:02:48] righteous we are, we are not qualified.
[2:02:51] Amen. Christianity is the only religion
[2:02:54] we were talking that is not merit-based,
[2:02:57] right? It is gracebased, right? It's not
[2:03:00] it's not based on works at all. Right?
[2:03:02] The rest are all, oh, do this, do that,
[2:03:04] you'll go,
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; right? But for us, we need the grace of
[2:03:07] God. No matter how righteous we are, how
[2:03:10] how good we are when we serve. No, it's
[2:03:12] all by the grace of God. Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Then number 10, mystery of MelkiseDC.
[2:03:18] Who is this Melkisedc? It's a mystery,
[2:03:20] right? And we know, yeah, Mel Melisedc
[2:03:24] was God himself in a Theophony body. Not
[2:03:27] Jesus the man yet, but the logos form of
[2:03:30] God.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; And we being his children
[2:03:34] have a theophony waiting for us. So
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; that's why when we go, we have a body
[2:03:40] waiting. Amen. That's our theophony. If
[2:03:43] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we
[2:03:46] have one already prepared. Isn't that a
[2:03:48] good promise for us, brothers and
[2:03:49] sisters? Whether we live, whether we
[2:03:51] die, we are Christ. So why worry,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; right? I hope this will burn in us as uh
[2:03:58] as we go along the way. Amen.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Mystery 11, marriage and divorce. A very
[2:04:03] difficult subject. We know. But then
[2:04:05] it's the word. Matthew 19:3-8. The
[2:04:09] Pharisees also came unto him, tempting
[2:04:11] him and saying unto him, Is it lawful
[2:04:13] for a man to put away his wife for every
[2:04:15] cause? And he answered and said unto
[2:04:17] them, Have you not read that he which
[2:04:20] made them at the beginning made them
[2:04:23] male and female? That's Matthew 19, by
[2:04:25] the way. And said, for this cause shall
[2:04:27] a man leave father and mother and shall
[2:04:29] cleave to his wife, and they twain shall
[2:04:32] be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more
[2:04:36] twain, but one flesh.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; What therefore God had joined together,
[2:04:40] let not man put us under. They say unto
[2:04:42] him, Why did Moses then command to give
[2:04:45] a writing of divorcement and put her
[2:04:47] away? He said unto them, Moses, because
[2:04:50] of the hardness of your hearts, allowed
[2:04:53] or suffered you to put away your wives,
[2:04:56] but from the beginning, it was not. So,
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; so you see, marriage is Yeah, I've been
[2:05:02] putting this in cards when I give cards,
[2:05:04] I think, to brother Logan and brother
[2:05:07] brother Tabiso. This is against the law
[2:05:10] of mathematics. E marriage
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; in mathematics 1 plus 1 is
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; in marriage is what? 1 plus 1 is
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; one. So you see it defies mathematics.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery, right? So Brandham,
[2:05:27] he warned of the corruption of and
[2:05:29] immorality of
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Laudisia,
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; the breakdown of homes and the falling
[2:05:34] away of churches. Imagine if I'm not
[2:05:37] mistaken, but I checked it. It's
[2:05:39] correct. In Canada, only in Quebec, when
[2:05:43] you get married, you're not allowed to
[2:05:45] take the husband's last name. You know
[2:05:48] that?
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't, but it's the truth. You
[2:05:52] can fact check it later, but I was I was
[2:05:54] told. I think it's Sister Ra uh Brother
[2:05:57] Francis and Sister Rachel, I guess.
[2:05:59] Yeah, they were the one who told us she
[2:06:01] cannot take the the the the husband's
[2:06:05] last name. They're already preparing for
[2:06:07] divorce because for them it's just a
[2:06:09] paper works, right?
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. Oh,
[2:06:15] what a terrible
[2:06:17] time we live in.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; But regardless,
[2:06:21] even you take the your last uh your your
[2:06:25] husband's last name, they will allow you
[2:06:27] to to divorce anyway. So, what's the
[2:06:29] point? It's the same. But for them, it's
[2:06:30] less paperworks, less tax money, right?
[2:06:33] less less employees. They they make
[2:06:36] sense in in a way, but for us it doesn't
[2:06:39] make sense. Amen. So God's perfect will
[2:06:42] is one man and one woman united by God.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; But because of sin, he permitted
[2:06:48] divorce. Today by opening by the opening
[2:06:52] of the word, God gives us grace. Grace,
[2:06:55] he gives us grace to restore back to the
[2:06:58] original order. He wants us to go back
[2:07:00] to the original order.
[2:07:03] And the prophet which is brother
[2:07:04] Brandham must declare the truth though
[2:07:07] it hurt right and and for us we
[2:07:10] ministers some it's difficult but it's
[2:07:13] the truth it's it's not our word it's
[2:07:15] the word of the Lord and the word of the
[2:07:17] prophet right number 12. Okay at least
[2:07:21] we get to the next page.
[2:07:23] Yes sir. Oh it's so rich but I'm I'm
[2:07:27] just giving you a snippet of everything.
[2:07:30] But then the thing is it's just to
[2:07:31] encourage you when you go back. Oh
[2:07:33] brothers and sisters, there's so much
[2:07:35] here in this message, 1200 plus
[2:07:37] messages. And if you want to be
[2:07:39] perfected, just just spend time. I'm
[2:07:42] guilty. Who's not guilty? Amen. Do do we
[2:07:46] have some other things that we do? Of
[2:07:47] course. Right? We're humans. We cannot
[2:07:49] spiritualize everything. But then the
[2:07:51] thing is at the end of the day, what do
[2:07:52] we need to do? We need to know our
[2:07:55] calling. We need to know our ministry. A
[2:07:57] prophetic ministry. Not only for the
[2:07:59] five-fold ministry but also to the
[2:08:01] bride.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the prophetic ministry is not
[2:08:04] only for the ones behind this pulpit
[2:08:07] because barb Yeah. I have a lot of
[2:08:09] quotes here. He mentioned that the bride
[2:08:11] has a ministry in the in the last age
[2:08:13] and it's composed of this five-fold.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; So if if it says bride, he didn't say
[2:08:19] only men, even women.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; And and and and to live that life of the
[2:08:25] message is a ministry by itself. Living
[2:08:28] the life is the best sermon preached.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; We were talking me and my wife. Yeah. He
[2:08:33] was she was in uh just a a little bit of
[2:08:36] a minute or something for for her. She
[2:08:39] went to supertore and then she was in
[2:08:41] line and then the the person behind or
[2:08:45] before he her or after. But anyway, he
[2:08:49] asked her, "Can you pay for my
[2:08:51] groceries?"
[2:08:55] And then uh
[2:08:57] Then she checked. Oh, it's quite so
[2:09:01] many. But then maybe I'll ask why. And
[2:09:05] smiling, why? Why you didn't need me to
[2:09:07] pay? No, no, no. I was just joking. He
[2:09:10] said, "I just knew that you will pay for
[2:09:13] it." No.
[2:09:15] Wow. Your hour says a thing that you
[2:09:20] will do it. There's a goodness in you.
[2:09:22] Oh, I'm not putting her up, but it's a
[2:09:25] real story. So she it's just fresh. So I
[2:09:28] need to to put this message fresh,
[2:09:30] right? So so that it's it's alive. So
[2:09:32] the thing there is that's a ministry
[2:09:35] brothers and sisters to manifest Christ
[2:09:38] to live a life that they will see us
[2:09:40] that we are real Christians.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And then yeah where do you go to church?
[2:09:46] And then when they ask oh it's in uh
[2:09:48] 11484. Where is that word? What is that?
[2:09:53] We're small church here. But then we
[2:09:54] believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:56] completely. Amen. We we preach the full
[2:09:58] word. Amen. In its fullness. Amen. It's
[2:10:00] the It's the Bible we preach. Amen. It's
[2:10:02] not any man man-made uh form of
[2:10:06] doctrine. Amen. We're so thankful. Amen.
[2:10:11] Where are we?
[2:10:15] Number 12. Okay. Restoration promise.
[2:10:18] This is very important. This is the
[2:10:20] fourth coming of Elijah the seventh
[2:10:22] angel of Leysian church aids. It's a
[2:10:24] resto restoration. Restore us where?
[2:10:27] Back to the faith of the original
[2:10:30] uh uh back to the faith of the original
[2:10:32] fathers. Right. Without any uh without
[2:10:36] any mixture of of doctrines. It's the
[2:10:38] pure word itself going back to the full
[2:10:40] word. Amen. That's the the very heart of
[2:10:45] brother Brandham's uh ministry, right?
[2:10:48] is to uh is to restore us. Amen. He
[2:10:52] didn't restore means bringing it back,
[2:10:55] right? Where it where uh from its
[2:10:57] original condition, right? He he was not
[2:11:00] the one who changed us. He just restored
[2:11:02] us. Amen.
[2:11:05] Oh, God is good. Amen.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And he promised Elijah, which is the
[2:11:09] prophet in these last days, to restore.
[2:11:12] Amen.
[2:11:13] Oh, the restoration is the bringing back
[2:11:16] of the faith once delivered to the
[2:11:18] saints. Amen. In Malachi 4 and
[2:11:20] Revelations 10:7 is it is the Lord by
[2:11:24] through the prophet of this age. Amen.
[2:11:26] The seventh angel's message restores the
[2:11:29] bride back to the apostolic faith. Amen.
[2:11:32] Number 13. I need to hurry so that at
[2:11:34] least uh uh the kingdom of heaven in
[2:11:37] parables 13. So we we know this the
[2:11:40] parable of the seed, the swer. Amen. Uh
[2:11:44] we will not tackle them but these are
[2:11:46] all this. So Jesus Christ was uh
[2:11:50] speaking in parables others will not
[2:11:53] understand but some will right and for
[2:11:56] us we understand all those parables.
[2:11:58] Amen.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; And they are in Matthew 13. Amen. So the
[2:12:03] the the teaching there of bar Branom is
[2:12:06] uh the kingdom of God is within you
[2:12:08] within us right it's Christ in us the
[2:12:12] hope of glory that's the kingdom of God
[2:12:14] just to simplify that and these parables
[2:12:17] were hid from the wise and prudent are
[2:12:20] we wise and prudent
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; I hope we we must be like babe so that
[2:12:25] we can
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; we can accept it amen
[2:12:29] oh the wheat and the tears grow together
[2:12:31] until the harvest But the the end time
[2:12:34] the wheat is gathered into the gardener
[2:12:37] and the tears will be burnt. Right? And
[2:12:39] for us we claim that we are the wheat
[2:12:42] because God put the the seed in us.
[2:12:44] Amen.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; And 14 Israel's blindness. We already
[2:12:48] talk about it. Right? So blindness in
[2:12:50] part is happened to Israel so that the
[2:12:52] fullness of the Gentiles will come in.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the mysterio of of Christ as
[2:12:58] the incarnate God and the Godhead. It's
[2:13:01] already discussed in the myster uh
[2:13:03] revealed in the Christ is the mystery of
[2:13:05] God revealed. Amen. And then uh the
[2:13:07] mystery of iniquity which is revealed in
[2:13:10] the seven seals. Who is this uh uh who
[2:13:13] is this antichrist is the horse rider,
[2:13:15] right? He warned that the antichrist
[2:13:17] spirit was already at work in the church
[2:13:19] systems. Imagine deceiving many. So the
[2:13:22] antichrist is in the church.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; It's not in the government because we
[2:13:27] know that that they are already evil but
[2:13:29] in the church. Imagine it's in the
[2:13:31] church itself. And we know that mystery
[2:13:34] of iniquity. Amen. And the mystery of
[2:13:36] Babylon and the mark of the beast.
[2:13:39] Oh, and and this one is the mother of
[2:13:42] our harlots. We know. That's why the
[2:13:43] call for us is come out of her, my
[2:13:46] people that ye be not partakers of her
[2:13:48] sins.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful for this message,
[2:13:53] brothers and sisters. We are
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; everything is being unveiled, right?
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we know what we're
[2:13:59] reading. That's why when when you read
[2:14:01] the the Bible, it's a new book because
[2:14:03] of the explanation, because of the
[2:14:05] revelation that was imparted to us by by
[2:14:09] Jesus Christ uh by by by the prophet by
[2:14:11] Jesus Christ through the prophet. Amen.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit
[2:14:15] himself. And the mystery of the new
[2:14:17] birth, we know that uh John 3:3, right?
[2:14:21] Uh Jesus answered and said unto him,
[2:14:24] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[2:14:26] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[2:14:28] kingdom of God." So you need to be born
[2:14:31] again.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:33] And Jesus answered and in in re in John
[2:14:36] 3:5, Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I
[2:14:38] say unto thee, except a man be born of
[2:14:40] water, which is
[2:14:43] typing baptism, and of the spirit, which
[2:14:46] is the Holy Spirit, he cannot even enter
[2:14:48] into the kingdom of God." That's the
[2:14:51] mystery of new birth, which is
[2:14:52] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[2:14:56] you and me. It's not a it's not a uh
[2:15:01] what what do you call it? uh compound
[2:15:03] revelation or uh additive re revelation
[2:15:07] whatever you call it it's an individual
[2:15:09] revelation. Amen.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:15:13] amen. And the other one is mystery of
[2:15:15] predestination.
[2:15:17] Right. We were saved
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the lamb was lain before
[2:15:24] the foundation of the world. Okay. Can
[2:15:27] we go with the next one brother if we
[2:15:28] have time? So you see here
[2:15:32] you cannot underestimate
[2:15:36] you might have seen this for sure right
[2:15:39] it's it's a tree that broke the rock and
[2:15:41] then just flew. So you see we cannot
[2:15:44] force someone to hear a message they are
[2:15:45] not ready to receive
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; but there is a but right
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; we must never underestimate the power of
[2:15:52] planting a seed. So anything that you
[2:15:54] plant today doesn't mean that it will
[2:15:56] spurt tomorrow. just wait, keep
[2:15:59] watering, right? Keep uh keep exposing
[2:16:02] it to the sun. Even in this case, it is
[2:16:04] even hidden under a rock, but still grew
[2:16:08] because it's a seed.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; So, if you're a seed, right, you will
[2:16:12] grow
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; to maturity. You will be perfected.
[2:16:16] Amen. Oh,
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; next slide, brother. Can you give me 15
[2:16:21] minutes? Is that okay?
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:24] because I will go to to the heart of
[2:16:27] this the prophetic ministry of the bride
[2:16:29] in this last age
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; right so you see revelations 10:1-7 is
[2:16:35] for Christ and the and and barbran but 8
[2:16:38] to11 is for us we need to prophesy again
[2:16:42] we need to take and eat up the open book
[2:16:46] and we know John is a type of the bride
[2:16:49] amen so you see Here
[2:16:52] he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[2:16:54] again. Why again? Because it's already
[2:16:56] prophesied before. So now we're
[2:16:58] continuing,
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; right? We we are continuing the ministry
[2:17:03] of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And then the ministry of Braham which is
[2:17:08] uh uh the whole thing for us which is
[2:17:11] the message of the hour. We are
[2:17:12] preaching it. We are prophesying
[2:17:14] preaching it. Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; And next slide brother.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; I'll just try.
[2:17:20] Thank you Lord.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; And he being the groom, the bride has to
[2:17:25] come forth
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; because it's part of him. And it can
[2:17:28] only be the manifestation of the
[2:17:30] fulfilling of all the revelations. Any
[2:17:32] others has spoke of the bride. It can
[2:17:36] only manifest it. If it does something
[2:17:39] different from the groom, it isn't the
[2:17:42] bride because she is flesh of his flesh,
[2:17:45] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[2:17:47] power of his power. She is him.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; We This is oneness. A man and a woman
[2:17:54] are one
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; and woman taken from his side. She had
[2:17:58] taken a spirit, the feminine spirit from
[2:18:00] him, the flesh from his side. Made both
[2:18:03] mechanics which is the word and
[2:18:04] dynamics, the Holy Spirit, the wife. So
[2:18:07] we are the bride coming of Christ. We
[2:18:11] are part of the second coming of Christ.
[2:18:13] Although the second coming it's not a
[2:18:15] it's not a it's not an event. The second
[2:18:19] coming of Christ is a timeline and it's
[2:18:22] happening right now. That's why we are
[2:18:24] called to the rapture. We are in the
[2:18:26] rapture right now. We already stepped in
[2:18:30] and we are being perfected day in day
[2:18:32] out and as we feed on the word. Amen. We
[2:18:35] are both the mechanics which is the word
[2:18:37] and the holy spirit. And that is the
[2:18:39] wife.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The wife, the wife has made
[2:18:43] herself ready,
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; We are bride is a newly wedded wife,
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; but there's no consummation yet at the
[2:18:50] bride for uh yet. But then when he's
[2:18:52] presented after the consummation to the
[2:18:55] marriage supper later on,
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; I have a Yeah.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; I have a lot more.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. But that's you and me.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the wife. Next slide,
[2:19:06] brother.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:08] Oh, this is the one that I I was
[2:19:10] speaking about. Would the bride have a
[2:19:12] ministry before the rapture? And that is
[2:19:15] now, right? Sure. That's what's going on
[2:19:18] right now. Right now. And this is even
[2:19:20] in 1963.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ. Certainly, it is
[2:19:25] the message of the hour.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; See the bride of Christ. Sure. She's
[2:19:29] consist of apostles, prophets, teachers,
[2:19:31] evangelists, and pastors. That's right.
[2:19:33] That's the bride of Christ. So, it means
[2:19:36] it's not the five-fold ministry. We were
[2:19:37] only limited to the people behind the
[2:19:39] pullpit. No, everyone. It's the bride of
[2:19:42] Christ.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; That's the bride of Christ. Sure, she's
[2:19:45] got a ministry. Great ministry. The
[2:19:47] ministry of the hour. It will be so
[2:19:49] humble. Next slide, brother. And you see
[2:19:52] here, there's also a purpose. The one
[2:19:53] that we're talking about that when we
[2:19:55] feed on the word here, we'll just sit
[2:19:57] here and feed feed feed. No, we have to
[2:20:00] do what is required of us. Let's read
[2:20:02] it. What is required of us? The purpose.
[2:20:06] That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:09] It's the Father again, God the Father
[2:20:11] dwelling in you, working out his plans
[2:20:14] to finish his plan of redemption.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Working through you, making you a
[2:20:19] co-orker with him. I'll stop there. The
[2:20:21] reason why I put that that red is
[2:20:23] co-orker. He didn't say we are worker of
[2:20:26] him. We are co-workers of him.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Right? We are all of the same level. We
[2:20:31] are co-workers. If you have a colleague,
[2:20:34] right? It means you're Amen.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; He's my colleague.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Although sometime of course we have
[2:20:41] boss, right? He's my boss for example.
[2:20:43] But if you say he's my colleague, then
[2:20:45] most likely he's not your boss.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You're of the same level. So in this
[2:20:50] case is the same. He asked us to be a
[2:20:52] coworker,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; not his worker.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Coworker. And what what do we need to
[2:20:58] do? Hunt for the lost souls as he did in
[2:21:01] the garden of Eden. Amen.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next, bro. And and and we know,
[2:21:08] yeah, it's also scriptural. You can see
[2:21:10] he that receive a prophet in the name of
[2:21:12] a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[2:21:14] reward. And what is his reward?
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Right? He he have eternal life. We will
[2:21:18] have eternal life too. But then it's not
[2:21:20] only stop at the prophet, he that
[2:21:23] receiveth a righteous man.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Are you righteous? Are you justified?
[2:21:28] Amen. Sanctified, baptized with the Holy
[2:21:30] Ghost, and living the full word. We are
[2:21:32] trying to live the full word because we
[2:21:34] are in the process. We might not be
[2:21:36] perfect. Amen.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; But we're in that process. All those
[2:21:39] virtues will come out. Brothers and
[2:21:40] sisters, just keep feeding. Just keep
[2:21:42] pressing on. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; He that receiveth a righteous man shall
[2:21:46] receive a righteous man's reward.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Go to page 21, brother.
[2:21:59] 21. Yeah, this one I know it it has been
[2:22:03] shown here. It's just to prove that the
[2:22:05] seals are open
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; in a descriptive illustrative way
[2:22:09] because when you in the in the old days,
[2:22:12] right, the the scrolls are not like this
[2:22:15] books that you can do it. It it's like
[2:22:18] scrolls like this. So if you have a
[2:22:20] let's say seven seven scrolls, the first
[2:22:23] message is you you you write it front
[2:22:26] and back and then roll it then seal it,
[2:22:28] right? Then the next one 2 3 4 5 6 7
[2:22:31] Just for the sake of illustration you
[2:22:33] can see here
[2:22:36] to go to number one right for those who
[2:22:39] haven't seen this. What will you do?
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; You have to break seven first.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal and then the six. 5 4 3
[2:22:49] 2 1. So that and then they will be all
[2:22:52] opened.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; But then they're not revealed until you
[2:22:56] open them. Yes.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; So there's a there's a difference
[2:22:59] between opening and revealing,
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; right? If you check because the you you
[2:23:04] see the the title of the seven seal,
[2:23:06] it's the revelation of the seventh seal.
[2:23:08] It it didn't say the opening of the
[2:23:09] seventh seal. It's the revelation
[2:23:11] because they are opened. They already
[2:23:13] opened by whom?
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Let's go with the next slide.
[2:23:16] Right. Uh they were opened. Uh let's go
[2:23:20] with a quote. We already read that, I
[2:23:21] guess. Let's go with a quote. There we
[2:23:24] go. Uh yeah.
[2:23:29] Uh okay.
[2:23:33] Page 25. Brother, I'm I'm skipping some
[2:23:36] because I promise 15 minutes. So is is
[2:23:41] it okay to break promise a little bit?
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:23:46] It is the rising of the sun. He is the
[2:23:49] one who opened those seals.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:53] He is those seals
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; for the whole word of God is Christ
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; and Christ is the seals that was opened.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; So what is the opening of the seals
[2:24:06] then?
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ. So is it revealed?
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Is it revealed? Is the book revealed?
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; And he said he he he pointed this they
[2:24:16] took the picture. What what picture? The
[2:24:19] cloud.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Right. So it means when he was there he
[2:24:23] was caught up and then he said go back
[2:24:25] to Jeffersonville go back east and
[2:24:27] preach the seven seals the opening of
[2:24:29] the seals right the revelation of the
[2:24:31] seven seals and that's why we don't need
[2:24:34] to worry right it is already revealed
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:24:40] hallelujah
[2:24:43] let's go to marriage process brother
[2:24:44] page 28 we're just in page something
[2:24:47] okay marriage process next one so I I
[2:24:49] put a table
[2:24:51] a bit uh on the stages of marriage.
[2:24:56] So at least it can be there are seven. I
[2:24:59] just put seven. You can put more because
[2:25:01] you if you argue more then that's
[2:25:04] another stage maybe right. So yeah
[2:25:08] but anyway it's part of it though. So
[2:25:11] decision that's the first thing.
[2:25:16] What's the spiritual meaning of uh of
[2:25:20] decision? It's like repentance and
[2:25:23] justification.
[2:25:24] This is the lion anointing. I'll I'll
[2:25:27] just put my notes here. I I will sleep.
[2:25:30] I I'll I'll stop on this uh
[2:25:34] these are so good, brothers and sisters.
[2:25:36] And uh it's just got revealed freshly.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; This week uh about uh even the anointing
[2:25:43] lion and even the gospel Matthew. It
[2:25:47] it's it's it's it just jibes with the
[2:25:49] message. I know this might be the first
[2:25:51] time you have seen this and it's so it's
[2:25:54] so rich but I will I have to stop and
[2:26:00] oh
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; brothers it's so good.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; But before going to the revelation four
[2:26:09] which is the four anointings I'll just
[2:26:10] read it so we have a background.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Right. So because we are in a marriage
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; in a marriage journey. Our journey is
[2:26:19] like a marriage. The reason why we need
[2:26:20] to be perfected is so that Christ can
[2:26:23] marry us.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; We can be wedded to him. That's the
[2:26:26] whole thing of the of the message of the
[2:26:29] hour is just like Elisar's
[2:26:31] uh duty. So Isaac typing God wanted a
[2:26:37] bride for Isaac his son. So he commanded
[2:26:41] Elisar his servant which is the prophet
[2:26:43] to look for a bride. So same for poor
[2:26:45] Brier Brham he was tasked by God to look
[2:26:50] for a bride for him. He was tasked by
[2:26:53] Jesus Christ. So s but after finding the
[2:26:56] bride he has to decrease
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; so that Christ can increase.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a redemption story. It's a
[2:27:05] love story. It's a marriage stage. It's
[2:27:09] a marriage process. So the four
[2:27:11] anointings so that at least there's a
[2:27:12] background here. The first beast was
[2:27:14] like a lion and the second beast like a
[2:27:16] calf and the third is a face of a man
[2:27:18] and the fourth beast was like a flying
[2:27:20] eagle. And we are in the flying eagle
[2:27:22] anointing this uh these days brothers
[2:27:25] and sisters. Give me give me a few more
[2:27:26] minutes please. Okay. Lion anointing
[2:27:30] Matthew
[2:27:32] and that is type to making a decision.
[2:27:36] So why Matthew if you read the gospel of
[2:27:39] Matthew he presents Christ as the king.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. the lion of Judah. Amen.
[2:27:47] And this anointing is anointing of
[2:27:49] courage,
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; boldness with the word. Ephesians,
[2:27:52] Ephesian church aids. Amen. Boldness.
[2:27:54] They were bold. They were like lion. Oh,
[2:27:56] this is wrong. Cut. Right. This is Oh,
[2:27:59] everything is cut. And we have that
[2:28:01] anointing too. Right. When we accepted
[2:28:03] the message, everything is bad.
[2:28:05] Everything that is not in line with the
[2:28:07] word, then we become legalistic.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; But it's a process. Amen.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; We have the boldness. We have the
[2:28:17] proclamation. So in marriage, it
[2:28:19] corresponds to the stage of decision.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; That is when the bride must boldly
[2:28:25] choose Christ.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's a decision. So for those who do
[2:28:30] didn't decide yet to accept Christ,
[2:28:33] there's still hope. Amen.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; And it is in Joshua. So you can see the
[2:28:37] first one, decision. It's like
[2:28:40] repentance. Repent and be baptized.
[2:28:41] That's justification, right? The baptism
[2:28:43] first stage. Amen. Choose your day.
[2:28:46] Joshua 24:15. Choose you this day whom
[2:28:50] you will serve,
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; But for me and my house, I will serve
[2:28:57] the Lord.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; That's a decision.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; What's the next one? It's engagement.
[2:29:07] The ox anointing.
[2:29:10] And it is Mark. So Mark the gospel
[2:29:13] it presents Christ as servant. Amen. The
[2:29:17] ox of sacrifice.
[2:29:19] So these are good ones. Uh if you don't
[2:29:22] agree that's okay. But uh Amen. Uh this
[2:29:25] is the anointing of patience.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Endurance.
[2:29:30] Martyrdom.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; It ties to engagement. Why engagement?
[2:29:35] It means when you get married you will
[2:29:37] die.
[2:29:39] Oh no, no it ties to it's consecration
[2:29:43] consecration
[2:29:45] faithfulness
[2:29:47] separation unto Christ. So you will be
[2:29:49] separated, right? When you're engaged,
[2:29:52] you cannot accept any more suitors or
[2:29:54] you cannot ask or woo somebody else's
[2:29:58] uh lady or some some somebody else,
[2:30:00] right? You are already engaged to be
[2:30:02] married. Amen. It's a separation unto
[2:30:04] Christ. You will leave everything for
[2:30:06] Christ. Amen. And scripture says 2
[2:30:09] Corinthians 11:2, for I am jealous over
[2:30:13] you with godly jealousy. For I have
[2:30:15] espoused you to a one husband that I may
[2:30:18] present you as a chase virgin to Christ.
[2:30:20] That's why we're called the bride of
[2:30:22] Christ. Because Paul, he tried to
[2:30:25] espouse us to him to Christ. Amen.
[2:30:28] That's why we're called the bride of
[2:30:30] Christ. Amen. And we this is the same as
[2:30:32] saying the body of Christ. Amen. Next
[2:30:35] page, brother. wedding.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Right? So these are stages that we we
[2:30:40] typically do, but uh maybe it's
[2:30:42] different in North America, but so I'm
[2:30:43] I'm talking about the Jewish way, right?
[2:30:46] Wedding is the it's the spiritual
[2:30:48] meaning is receiving the Holy Ghost.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the anointing there is
[2:30:52] face of a man and it's Luke. Luke is a
[2:30:55] doctor, right? Luke is a very
[2:30:58] intelligent man.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; And he presented Christ as son of man,
[2:31:02] full of wisdom.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's Luke. Yeah. And this is the
[2:31:07] anointing of intelligence, reform,
[2:31:08] discernment. And it ties to the wedding
[2:31:11] and consummation.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The wedding, receiving the Holy
[2:31:16] Ghost, face of a man. And also uh with
[2:31:19] Luke, you you can see later on is also
[2:31:21] uh uh part of it. You can see Ephesians
[2:31:24] 1:13. In whom ye also trusted after that
[2:31:27] ye heard the word of truth, the gospel
[2:31:29] of your salvation. in whom also after
[2:31:32] that ye believe you were sealed with the
[2:31:35] Holy Spirit of promise. Amen. And you
[2:31:38] can see that's uh the wedding and then
[2:31:40] we go with consummation your sealed life
[2:31:42] and adoption process which is the flying
[2:31:45] eagle
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; and it's John and why why for for John
[2:31:49] is
[2:31:51] you can see in Romans 8:15 for ye have
[2:31:53] not received the spirit of bondage again
[2:31:55] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[2:31:58] of adoption whereby we cry aba father
[2:32:02] right you are adopted now fully of
[2:32:05] course uh wedding and then consummation
[2:32:07] you consummated the marriage, right? So,
[2:32:09] and then the next one I'm just hearing,
[2:32:11] we will go to the wedding supper, which
[2:32:13] is the rapture, which is the marriage of
[2:32:15] the married supper of the lamb. Amen.
[2:32:17] And it's a flying eagle anointing. We
[2:32:20] see the end from the beginning. It's not
[2:32:22] just an eagle, brothers and sisters.
[2:32:24] It's just it is flying eagle because an
[2:32:26] eagle on the ground is just like any
[2:32:28] other chicken.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Right. But then when he soarses high
[2:32:32] with the two wings, Old Testament and uh
[2:32:35] New Testament, Right? He can see the end
[2:32:38] from the beginning. His his his view,
[2:32:40] his point of view is so wide that he can
[2:32:43] see the end from the beginning.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; And that's the anointing for this age,
[2:32:46] brothers and sisters.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, flying eagle. And you are in the
[2:32:50] honeymoon stage at that time,
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; right? Oh, flying eagle. This is also
[2:32:56] flying eagle anointing you can say.
[2:32:58] Yeah, this is three and a half years.
[2:33:00] And then after that, we go to the
[2:33:01] millennium. And Barbara Branham called
[2:33:03] it the honeymoon stage. and and and in
[2:33:06] Revelations 20 and4 you can see that
[2:33:09] that's uh when and I saw thrones and sat
[2:33:12] upon them and judgment was given unto
[2:33:14] them and I saw the souls of them that
[2:33:15] were beheaded for the witness of Jesus
[2:33:17] and for the word of God and which had
[2:33:19] not worshiped the beast neither his
[2:33:21] image neither had received his mark upon
[2:33:23] their foreheads or in their heads and
[2:33:25] they lived and reigned with Christ a
[2:33:28] thousand years that's why millennium
[2:33:30] millennium is a thousand years amen
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; I'll call the musician last slide I
[2:33:35] eternal living together.
[2:33:38] So after your honeymoon, the real thing
[2:33:41] will come.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; When you will live together for long,
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; right? So, and then that's the new
[2:33:48] heaven and new earth which is the eighth
[2:33:50] day.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's also a flying eagle
[2:33:54] which is also John. And in Revelations
[2:33:57] 21:20 uh 21 2-3 he saw John saw the holy
[2:34:02] city new Jerusalem coming down from God
[2:34:06] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[2:34:08] adorned for her husband.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; And I heard a great voice out of heaven
[2:34:12] saying behold the tabernacle of God is
[2:34:14] with men and he will dwell with them and
[2:34:17] they shall be his people and God himself
[2:34:19] shall be with them and be their God.
[2:34:21] This is the ultimate
[2:34:24] destination brothers and sisters.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; We will go back from nothing to
[2:34:30] eternity.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Because we are the predestinated
[2:34:35] seed.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; That will grow and mature to perfection.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; And how can you achieve that is by the
[2:34:42] heeding our prophetic ministry.
[2:34:46] Right? Our prophetic ministry is to look
[2:34:49] for the last predest dead seat. Of
[2:34:51] course, we need to mature first. Yes.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Right. So that we can be wedded with
[2:34:55] Christ and then we can share this good
[2:34:57] news which is the gospel.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Oh last light brother. Oh second to the
[2:35:02] last but the other one lesson.
[2:35:04] Revelations 19:7-9. Let us be glad and
[2:35:06] rejoice and give honor to him who Christ
[2:35:10] for the marriage of the lamb is come and
[2:35:13] his wife had made herself ready.
[2:35:16] Are are we ready? Are we getting ready?
[2:35:18] If we're not ready, that's okay. But are
[2:35:20] we getting ready? Are we in a journey?
[2:35:23] Are we going? Are we moving? Or are we
[2:35:25] always stopping and then eating in
[2:35:27] whatever? Right. We need to move
[2:35:30] forward.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should
[2:35:35] be arrayed in fine linen.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Clean and white. For the fine linen is
[2:35:40] the righteousness of saints.
[2:35:42] Righteousness being justified. Being
[2:35:45] fully owned by him. We are owned by him.
[2:35:49] We don't own ourselves, brothers and
[2:35:51] sisters. Even our children, they we
[2:35:52] don't own them. We are all owned by God.
[2:35:56] Amen.
[2:35:58] And he said unto him, "Write, blessed
[2:36:00] are they which are called unto the
[2:36:02] married supper of the lamb." We are
[2:36:03] blessed because that's the only thing
[2:36:04] we're waiting now is the body change.
[2:36:06] Married supper of the lamb, wedding
[2:36:08] supper. Amen. And we can be clothed.
[2:36:12] Next slide, brother.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Like him, the word bride.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, we need to
[2:36:22] have a transition,
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; right? We might be bride now but we
[2:36:26] cannot stay as only as bride. We need to
[2:36:29] be the wife.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Right. And that is the we will be
[2:36:32] presented in the married supper as wife
[2:36:34] not bride anymore because we are ready.
[2:36:38] Amen. And we thank the Lord for for this
[2:36:41] uh message of the hour that just
[2:36:43] unfolded revealed all these mysteries.
[2:36:46] They might be oh forgive me for for this
[2:36:49] long service but uh
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; I hope something struck you. your heart.
[2:36:54] Amen. And and just encourage you to to
[2:36:56] move forward because we're in a journey,
[2:36:58] brothers. We're in a journey to
[2:37:00] perfection. Oh,
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:37:18] You see
[2:37:20] stature of a perfect man. He built He
[2:37:22] didn't build a wall. He built a house in
[2:37:26] his image, in his likeness.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; He built a masterpiece.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; And that's you and me. The bride, the
[2:37:35] wife is the masterpiece of Christ. Oh,
[2:37:38] we thank the Lord. How can that happen
[2:37:41] by by by
[2:37:43] accident? No, it's predestination. All
[2:37:45] these mysteries if we understand them,
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; we don't need to understand them.
[2:37:51] Actually, just believe them, right?
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; And through the message of the hour,
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; we have the source. Remember
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; I I mentioned that this is an apple but
[2:38:02] it has a bite
[2:38:06] to put some attention right it means it
[2:38:08] came from the knowledge of good and evil
[2:38:10] although they don't claim that and I
[2:38:13] think even baren mentioned the first
[2:38:15] first Apple computer was priced 666.67
[2:38:21] or 66 66.66 66 dollars.
[2:38:25] So all these things, serpent seed,
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; all these things, mysteries, right? And
[2:38:32] knowledge of good and evil, there's good
[2:38:35] in it.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; We need to use of the good, not of the
[2:38:39] evil. Amen.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers and sisters, I want to
[2:38:42] encourage you that the that the the
[2:38:44] message that we accepted is Christ
[2:38:47] himself. It's not it's not legalistic uh
[2:38:50] law or whatever. It's grace of the Lord
[2:38:53] Jesus Christ.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, so good.
[2:38:58] I'm so thankful for him. Amen.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; For his uh revelation, for his uh
[2:39:05] unfolding. I hope you're blessed this
[2:39:07] morning. I
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Do you have a song, brother? We can sing
[2:39:11] before we
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:20] Can you hear the sound of heaven
[2:39:26] like the sound of many
[2:39:31] waters?
[2:39:34] It's the sound of worship
[2:39:38] coming from the throne.
[2:39:43] [Music]
[2:39:47] There are cries
[2:39:50] of adoration
[2:39:55] as men from every
[2:39:59] nation
[2:40:03] lift their voice
[2:40:06] to make his glory
[2:40:10] known. Oh,
[2:40:14] [Music]
[2:40:16] singing
[2:40:18] holy, holy,
[2:40:21] holy are you Lord.
[2:40:28] [Music]
[2:40:30] [Applause]
[2:40:32] Holy, holy,
[2:40:36] holy
[2:40:37] are you Lord.
[2:40:41] [Music]
[2:40:46] The ely
[2:40:51] [Music]
[2:41:05] are you
[2:41:13] singing?
[2:41:14] Holy, holy,
[2:41:18] holy are you Lord.
[2:41:27] Singing
[2:41:29] holy, holy,
[2:41:32] holy are you Lord.
[2:41:37] [Music]
[2:41:42] [Applause]
[2:41:43] There's
[2:41:45] [Music]
[2:41:50] our redee.
[2:41:58] Holy, holy,
[2:42:01] holy are you Lord.
[2:42:07] Isn't he holy? Isn't he wonderful?
[2:42:11] Just uh some notes. You see
[2:42:17] in a marriage,
[2:42:19] right? When a man
[2:42:22] buries a woman, he justifies her.
[2:42:27] Regardless of her past, that's already
[2:42:30] forgiven. That's already settled. And
[2:42:32] the woman that was given the ring will
[2:42:36] be his bride. Right? So it's the same
[2:42:40] thing and he will take or she will take
[2:42:43] the the the last name with with my wife
[2:42:48] she takes my name whatever I own she
[2:42:51] owns.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Whatever she owns she owns right and
[2:42:56] also of course I own also but then the
[2:42:58] thing is in the world is different. They
[2:43:01] want separate uh bank accounts, right?
[2:43:03] But then the thing is for us
[2:43:06] justification means you have not done it
[2:43:09] in the first place.
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you forget everything. I think
[2:43:13] uh we're in the season of bit of quite a
[2:43:15] few marriages, right? Uh brother Logan,
[2:43:19] Sister Ruth, uh Sister Rebecca, and the
[2:43:21] ones that will get married soon, right?
[2:43:24] The thing is when you choose you you you
[2:43:27] might uh you might have looked for
[2:43:30] different prospects if you're the man
[2:43:33] but then the thing is it's the one that
[2:43:35] you gave the ring
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; that will be your bride
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; it's not the others right so for us God
[2:43:43] gave us the ring
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; right gave us the ring so that we can be
[2:43:48] united with him we know we're not in a
[2:43:50] marriage setting here but there are
[2:43:52] three rings Right?
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; Engagement ring, wedding ring and
[2:43:57] longsuffering. Right? So we we need to
[2:44:00] know all those because we are living
[2:44:02] with Christ when we go with eternity.
[2:44:04] New heaven and new earth. That's
[2:44:06] longsuffering. And that's the truth in
[2:44:08] marriage. It's longsuffering between a
[2:44:09] wife and a and a husband.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Right? It's not only honeymoon. No,
[2:44:15] honeymoon stage is over. Right? We have
[2:44:17] to go back to the reality now
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; that we need to work. Right?
[2:44:23] But the at the the at the last end
[2:44:25] though is we need to multiply or
[2:44:28] reproduce Jesus Christ. That's why being
[2:44:31] a bride the purpose of Christ having a
[2:44:34] bride is so that he can reproduce
[2:44:36] himself. And it must be the same
[2:44:38] material,
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; right? Same material of God. If God is
[2:44:42] God, Jesus is God, then the bride must
[2:44:45] be also a little God
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; because he cannot reproduce himself with
[2:44:49] another species.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Right? A dog cannot mate with a cat.
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; It must be God and God and then equals
[2:44:56] God. And that's the reason of our being
[2:44:58] injected, impregnated by the word of
[2:45:01] God. And this message of the hour, all
[2:45:03] these mysteries which are history now
[2:45:05] will make us perfect and mature. Amen.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; Another song, brother.
[2:45:12] Uh,
[2:45:17] how about the glorious church without
[2:45:19] spot or wrinkle?
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:45:23] to
[2:45:28] the summing brother
[2:45:32] longing up the streams of life.
