Description:
While the world looks upon me
As I struggle along
They say I've got nothing
But they are so wrong
In my heart I'm rejoicing
How I wish they could see
Thank you Lord
For your blessing on me!

Chorus
There's a roof up above me
I've a good place to sleep
There's food on my table
And shoes on my feet
You gave me your love Lord
And a fine family
Thank you Lord
For your blessings on me!

I know I'm not wealthy
These clothes, they're not new
I don't have much money
But Lord I have you
And that's all that matters
Though the world may not see
Thank you Lord
For your blessings on me!
