While the world looks upon me as I true alone. They say I have nothing but they are so wrong. Maybe in my heart I'm rejoicing. Now I will thank you. Thank you for your blessing. There's a place to stay is good on my team and shoes on you. You gave me and my father. Thank you for your blessings. I know I'm not worthy. And these clothes are not new. I don't have much money, but Lord, I have you and that's all that matters. Though the world may not see, thank you Lord for your blessings on me. There's a roof up above me. I have a good place for you to see. There's food on my table and shoes on my feet. You gave me your love and a fine family. Thank you Lord for your blessings on me. as a roof up above me.
