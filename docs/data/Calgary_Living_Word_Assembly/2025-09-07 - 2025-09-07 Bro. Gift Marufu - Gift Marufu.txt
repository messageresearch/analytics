So just the way the Lord works, he works in both ends, doesn't he? He's wonderful. Stand with me if you would as we change the order of the service this morning. Can you hear the sound from heaven singing holy, holy as her brother comes? I don't know the order this morning. If the deacon would come first or his great brother gift up to you. I'll just let you choose that. Oh, can you hear the sounds from heaven? Like the sound of many waters. It's the sound of worship coming from your throne.

[Music] Holy, holy, are you Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this morning. We may take our seats for a few moments and uh I'll just get the musicians to uh um How many are happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh just wanted to do uh say a few things here before we get going. Um we are just so happy to be with you again. Uh you know each day that passes, it takes the grace of God for us to uh breathe this breath of life, young and old alike. And so we don't take life. &gt;&gt; Amen. just seems like several months ago we were here and the Lord has brought us here again to be with you. So I say God bless you and uh not only God bless you uh but but I say shalom to you &gt;&gt; and and shalom means more than just peace. &gt;&gt; It means good tidings to you. &gt;&gt; It means let the sun shine upon you. the S O N. &gt;&gt; So, we bring you greetings from uh Zambia uh from our pastor, brother Ronica Pisha, uh and his wife, Sister Deborah. Uh they've been uh here before and um when brother Ken was still here uh and they preached in this uh congregation. So, we thank the Lord. They are still um soldiering on and they said, "Wherever you go, uh make sure you say a big hello to the saints." And uh we are thankful for uh our pastor here, brother uh Barry uh for always having open door for us. Um I know he's with brother Wayne Lawson this morning. Uh but he says to take our liberty. Uh and uh I see we are in very good hands. We have elders here. Brother Paul, uh thank you for the wonderful song service and sister Len. Um, you know, we've been in touch with uh brother Emanuel um and uh brother Maven there uh and and and and others. Uh you're just a wonderful group of people. Thank you for uh um allowing us to be uh with you uh today and uh brother John there made us uh feel really welcome. So we thank the Lord for you and um this morning um uh I just want to encourage the church &gt;&gt; uh you know this message uh uh doesn't down on the believer. This message supposed to lift the believer up. &gt;&gt; We we're not in a time where we shove each other down. Uh this message has especially the time that we are living in with all kinds of trials and temptations that we're going through. Uh it's a time to encourage each other. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says even more so uh uh be mindful of meeting and going to church. Church, brother Brennham says, doesn't serve you uh but it helps. &gt;&gt; Burdens are lifted here. And when you hear testimonies and songs, worship the Lord, that's what we are here to do. &gt;&gt; Last evening, uh, of course, we are we've been in Canada now for, uh, this time around for about four or five weeks. And, uh, we are kind of missing home, you know. Um uh I was telling uh I was telling the church in Saskatoon, I said um one thing the Lord have found favor with the Lord, brother Paul is, uh even with the lucrative job that I had at the University of Saskatchewan there as head of department. God has taken away that desire completely. I drive by there, I don't even feel anything. And uh I'm so thankful that uh the Lord uh was in it and uh the Lord has been blessing us um the the missionary work has been going and it's been tremendous with conventions uh in uh countries like our country Zambia um across across northwest south uh east and um other countries Malawi we've had uh huge conventions there areas like Blantire uh Muzu um Chinji Leonge the capital and we are all over the map and uh our itinerary is quite booked right now and uh we ask for your prayers if uh there's somebody you can pray for pray for us Zimbabwe is calling South Africa is calling and uh and so we are we are thankful to be uh just doing our part um and um so uh if we may stand to our fit this morning and strike me the chord for that song. Um we had uh we're so um privileged to be with uh brother uh uh brother Cabab there uh and uh sisters wa brother Richard and sisters wand prepared a really good traditional meal for us. Oh that was so good. How many have eaten ugali here? I see some hands. Yeah. Yeah. You know what that I'm talking about. And the good old okra and and h goat stew. Oh my goodness. I was I was biting my tongue there. I took a chunk and uh it felt like home. So if that can happen in the physical like that, &gt;&gt; how much more with spiritual food this morning? &gt;&gt; Uh you know I I'm trusting we came with empty bears. And and if you came half full, uh you can fill again right to the brim. &gt;&gt; David said, "My cup runth over." &gt;&gt; And let the joy of the Lord run over you today &gt;&gt; and let the Holy Spirit run over you today. &gt;&gt; I see the church is on fire already. I'm just testing the temperature this morning to see where. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; How many came here for church this morning? That's what we are here to do right now. to show the devil which side we belong. To say, "Satan, you knocked me down, but God raised me up again. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the living God. &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoever wrote that song, &gt;&gt; something had struck &gt;&gt; to the depth of their soul. &gt;&gt; They found out very quickly that on their own, they couldn't do nothing. &gt;&gt; And that's my confession this morning. I am weak but he is strong. &gt;&gt; I can do nothing but he can do everything through me. &gt;&gt; And that's what my confession here. &gt;&gt; I stand in all within presence of whom the wisdom moving is life. Oh, the rage of the seed. [Music] You want his soul of life in my [Music] home and my oh my is the Lord [Music] forever. Ever [Music] he stand every rising sun to meet the sinner of God. And I take for each one this morning to offer healing this morning and forgiveness from the table. [Music] Heat. Heat. My [Music] sing again [Applause] I see my [Applause] [Music] Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, you the fountain of life, &gt;&gt; the only source of life, &gt;&gt; the alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan would describe you as the all in all, &gt;&gt; the start and the finish. &gt;&gt; We come this morning again knowing that our life is in your hand, &gt;&gt; life and death always move side by side. One moment you are alive, the next moment you are gone. But you've given us this breath of life &gt;&gt; to be in the house of the Lord, to worship you in truth and in spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have received the message shalom. &gt;&gt; And we know who we are and we know where we are dwelling. &gt;&gt; We're just here that Lord you may encourage us. Lord, if we have run short, rise up again, Lord. May we throw another shell &gt;&gt; like Samson would say, one more time. &gt;&gt; Just one more time this Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Come by our way, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We lift up our eyes unto you and our faith because we know our faith cometh from the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not our own faith. It's the faith of our fathers. &gt;&gt; It's still living still today. &gt;&gt; So walk with us again, Lord. We trust that Lord where you promise that where two or three are gathered in your name, there you are in their midst. &gt;&gt; Here there's more than two of us. Help us bless us together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, young and old alike and uh in between. Be with us, Lord. And we pray that you bless the preaching of thy word and the reading of thy word to our hearts. We ask these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. While we are still uh standing, &gt;&gt; uh may we turn our Bibles. Very familiar scripture. We want to just coast along for a little bit here. Thank you to the music and the musicians. Um for helping with that worship. Mark 11, chapter 20. Mark 11, chapter 20. Lord willing, this is our last Sunday here in Canada. We are going back home. Lord willing, we are flying out on Thursday, very early mornings. We ask for your prayers and we'll always be praying for you as well. &gt;&gt; When we kneel down in our chamber, we will always tell the Lord to remember this little congregation, &gt;&gt; this little part of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark 11 chapter 20 and we'll go to verse 20 20- 24. And in the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master before the fig tree. Behold the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away. And Jesus answering saying saith unto them, have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For verily I say unto you, that what whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou moved, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in their heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, &gt;&gt; he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe, and ye receive them, and ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of the word to our hearts this morning. &gt;&gt; We may take our seats. &gt;&gt; You know, the enemy likes to attack uh when he knows that there's victory ahead. &gt;&gt; That's when Satan really wants to pounce on you. I'm here to encourage you this morning that if you see something and you're going through trials and tribulations, &gt;&gt; that's the time to begin to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the time to begin to sing songs of Zion &gt;&gt; because the devil knows that he can if he can put that distraction to you that then he'll get you away from focusing on the word. Each time the enemy wants to uh uh uh uh or he perceives that there's victory ahead of you, then he wants to put all kinds of roadblocks in front of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking here for an experience because uh after preaching in Saskatoon last Sunday, the brothers decided to take me for uh for fishing and we went all the way to Lrange there and uh it was a a place where there's no self service. It's completely off-grid. Uh we had good fishing there, brother Paul. Walley everywhere. And uh I caught the biggest one uh that I could. And I thought, "Oh, that was really good." And we how good it is to just cut catch a good fresh fish uh with very so much fat in it. And and and then just by the leg side uh uh prepare it and eat it so fresh. Feels so good in the mouth. I was uh and uh I was rejoicing, but then the devil the day we were starting off, the devil attacked me and and all of a sudden I had this terrible flu with my son Junior there and uh and everything else. And uh we we were in terrible shape. Uh and and and and so uh I I asked the Lord, I said, "If it's thy will, I will get to Calvary." Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the devil has be given me a black eye right now, &gt;&gt; when I get to the pit there, I'll give him two black eyes. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm here to do this morning is to give the devil two black eyes because the prophet says when the enemy say boo to you, you say boo &gt;&gt; to him. I guess I guess that's what we are here to do this morning. &gt;&gt; So glad to be with my wife there. you know, we she's a missionary uh as well, and we travel all kinds of places. We've gone into the the jungles of Africa where we've slept on the floor on a mat uh with uh with rats all over the place. We've also gone to places where where we've slept on a bed and the bed is sinking in between in the middle. We've gone to places where, you know, uh, places infested with bed bugs, but we've gone to places where it's been very good, too. Very nice hotels in Africa. So, it's not all jungle. There are some areas that are really really nice as well. &gt;&gt; And and so we we she's always with me. We always travel together. Wherever we go, we go together. And I'm thankful to have her here. Um she is uh uh the pillar that helps me choose what I I uh what I wear and the ties. So if I look good uh uh give kudos to her and so we thank we thank the Lord. She does my tie. I don't even know how to tie a tie myself. And uh so and uh so we were in this place one day and uh we're sleeping and it's pitch dark and uh all of a sudden uh there was a rat uh that came and beat my my toe. Uh it was so painful and blood gushing everywhere. I was very angry at that rat and I tried to look for it. It was gone. So that's the way of a missionary. You go to all kinds of places and leading souls to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have just read here and uh and uh I want to because it challenged me as an individual. This scripture challenged me. &gt;&gt; We are so much used to say Lord uh uh what can I do? Lord, Lord help me here. Lord help. Now this scripture is particularly it's particularly challenging you and me as individuals. And I want to build with it to where we are today this this morning. &gt;&gt; The Bible says if you not him if you can say to this mountain move &gt;&gt; and you don't doubt in your heart &gt;&gt; and you say be cast into the sea it shall happen just the way you have said it &gt;&gt; because why you have reached to that level now where you can speak the word of God because the word has become one with you my brother. The Bible says at that day you shall know that I and my father are one &gt;&gt; and I in you and you in me my brother. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. It's not coming. It's already here. &gt;&gt; We are so full of saying it's coming or the revival is coming. This is coming. It's already here. Revival we will not see such a great number. The prophet has already declared. But revival is you in you and me as individuals this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can choose to get revived right this morning and say, "Lord, I need that revival in my heart." &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother. I know we were together in Saskatoon last Sunday and uh we had lunch together. &gt;&gt; It was good to be with you. But I I'm here to encourage you, church, that don't lean, don't rely on the mistakes of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Don't be defined by the circumstances of yesterday. What happened yesterday, the Lord Jesus Christ has already taken care of it. &gt;&gt; The blood, you are not on your own. The blood of Jesus Christ speaks on your behalf. My brother &gt;&gt; speak better words than those of Abel. Let me encourage you this morning. If you are done down this morning, rise up again as a child of the living God. I say, "As for me and my house, we shall serve the living God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't allow the enemy to come between you and the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't allow the enemy to to depress you. &gt;&gt; I was just preaching not long ago here at some church and after service two elderly sisters come by and say with tears streaking down says, "You spoke to my heart. If that wasn't for anybody, it was for me." That should be the declaration of every believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at who is beside you, who is in front of you, who is behind you. Don't look at your mother, don't look at your father. You young people, rise up again and run with the baton of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been predestined to be overcomers in this hour. You've been predestined to be to be the bride of Jesus Christ. Remember the prophet says, "I no longer call you church anymore." &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's who you are, my brother. Don't allow the enemy to give you all kinds of names. &gt;&gt; Rely on what the Lord says. &gt;&gt; In Jeremiah 29:1, the prophet, the Bible says, "I know the thoughts that I have for you." &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what the thoughts the devil has for you or be concerned about what God thinks about you. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about how you look, my brother, my sister. Don't worry about what clothing you have. You worry that you are in the in that mind. Be concerned whether you are in the mind of God or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my encouragement to you this morning. Our God is still in the business of healing. &gt;&gt; Our God is still in the business of delivering. &gt;&gt; Our God is still in the business of giving uh grace to you. He's a God of second chances. He's a God of third chances, fourth chances. If you go sincerely unto him, he will hear your heart's cry this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here to ask you, what's your mountain? &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet, so I can't tell you what's in your life, but I know that the word of God is sharper than any double-edged sword, and he's a designer of every heart, every spirit. Right now, he's discerning in the congregation. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; you know your deficiencies. I know my deficiencies. I would say like that man, help thou my unbelief, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because in here, we don't come to look at each other. We don't come to measure each other. And and we come to measure ourselves with the word of God. &gt;&gt; In here, there's no room to look down on each other. This is the church of the living God we are talking about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody has the right to the tree of life &gt;&gt; and that's the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning? &gt;&gt; My Let me take off this jacket. &gt;&gt; You can't plow the field with a jacket on. &gt;&gt; And we are in this field of the message of the hour. It's here to revive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's a people that should be free, it's the message people in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to say this, brothers and sisters. There's so many people around the message, but very few in the message. &gt;&gt; We need to get into the message and get one with the message. &gt;&gt; God help me. I'm not preaching down on you, my brother. I'm preaching to myself and to my household as well. May God be merciful. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Every time a message comes, it brings with it three things: grace, mercy, and deliverance." Every time a minister stands, a true minister of war, God stands in the pulpit has to be give these three things. &gt;&gt; Grace, mercy, deliverance. &gt;&gt; While it's still around, I urge you to receive it this morning. &gt;&gt; Every time you put your hand up, my brother, you are receiving your answer from above. &gt;&gt; Every time you say amen, God answers your prayer. Every time you say you hallelujah, Satan doesn't love those things, my brother. &gt;&gt; Exposition of the seven churches. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan says Jesus Christ is not only the word of God, &gt;&gt; he's also the God of the word. &gt;&gt; Not only that, my brother, he's not only the God of the word, he's also the God of the Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, he loves it when you say your amens, your amens are not in vain. They're glorifying Almighty God this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning? &gt;&gt; Every one of us has a little mountain. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are having challenges in life. Maybe you're having challenges in your marriage. I'll tell you my brother, our Jesus Christ is still in the in the business of mending marriages this morning. He can bring love where love has been lost. He can bring that warmth in the home where it has been lost. He's he is the God of total restoration. &gt;&gt; Maybe a little conquer worm has come in your life in my life. Palmer, caterpillar, locust and starting to eat away a little bit. You know the devil comes so sly &gt;&gt; and starting to eat away a little bit. Oh, may the shalom of God shine upon your life and restore again that which the devil has taken from you. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded of uh David in kings there. Something had happened to him. The Amalachites and others had come and they had taken over the city, the city of Zikla. They didn't wipe up the the people. &gt;&gt; They just got everybody who was there, &gt;&gt; the women, the men, the children, everything, bent the whole place over and they took those people with them. &gt;&gt; And the people when they realize that they were so upset with David. &gt;&gt; There comes a time in life where you know who your true friends are. &gt;&gt; Let something wrong happen in your life, my brother. Everybody else will run away from you. Just a few friends will be left. Those are the true friends that are with you in hard times and good times. &gt;&gt; And David, they wanted to stone him. And the Bible says David put his confidence in the Lord. &gt;&gt; It came a time that David prayed a prayer &gt;&gt; and said, "This has happened Lord. May I pursue my enemies? May I overtake them? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, the word of the Lord said, "Go pursue &gt;&gt; and overtake your enemies &gt;&gt; and get everything &gt;&gt; back." &gt;&gt; I'm here to encourage you this morning. Take everything back that the enemy has stolen from you, my brother. &gt;&gt; Belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is your portion. is your inheritance this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Gift, you're sweating it out. You are laboring. Yes, I'm a laborer in my master's field. &gt;&gt; This morning, Brother Gift, you go to the gym. I don't go to the gym. This is my gym here. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; So, David took his men, 22 of them, I believe, and started pursuing the enemy &gt;&gt; and they overtook the enemy. M &gt;&gt; and they got everything and slaughtered every enemy. If that can happen to David who was under the blood of bulls and gods, what about you who is under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning? I say pursue, go overtake and get everything that belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Your marriage belongs to you. Your children belongs to you. Your father, your mother, claim whatever belongs to you, my brother. &gt;&gt; That position at work belongs to you. If the enemy wants to take that word from you, reject and rebuke the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Gift, I'm going for an interview. I don't know what to say. The Bible says, don't worry what you're going to say. I will give you the words to say. &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. &gt;&gt; May I say this this morning? I don't care what mountain is ahead of you. If you say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; be moved and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart, it shall happen, my brother. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That mountain has to move. And brother Brennham qualified it further. He said, if one grain &gt;&gt; of that mountain begins to move, the mountain has already started moving. &gt;&gt; Let that grain move in your life right now. May God drop something in your heart that say Lord I believe even now Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; it happened to Martha Mo Lazarus had been dead for 4 days &gt;&gt; dead body decomposed and stinky and everything. Martha said to the Lord if you had been here Moses that Lazarus wouldn't have died. &gt;&gt; Oh brother our Lord Jesus Christ is still here this morning. He says, "I will be with you even in you to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; He'll never leave you." When you think that you are in deep trouble &gt;&gt; and the Lord is not there, that's when you should realize very quickly that this who is putting that in my mind is the devil. Because I know that when I'm in deep trouble, that's when the Lord picks me up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's that kind of a God this morning that can hear your heart's cry. Yeah, &gt;&gt; those two ladies, separate ones, come to me and said, "I'm suffering from depression. &gt;&gt; What you preached there hit my heart, &gt;&gt; depression, anxiety, &gt;&gt; is hitting young people, &gt;&gt; the middle age, and even the elderly, &gt;&gt; right? 200 million demons have been released and unleashed on this earth, &gt;&gt; buffeting parents and grandparents and children left, right, center, everybody. There's nobody immune, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Pastors, ministers, bishops, whatever the title, the devil is at work &gt;&gt; trying to bring you down. But I know as a child of the living God, I don't care how down you get, but God will bring you up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil is a loser. &gt;&gt; And you are on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Whatever happens, you're on the winning side. &gt;&gt; I was telling a church in Spruce Grove in Alberta there in Edmonton there. I was watching and flipping through the that the that that the the the screen in my room and my hotel room and I came across where there they they were about to play soccer. Back home we call it football. They were about to play soccer and those were two prominent teams and I looked at them for a little while and during the time I used to watch soccer like crazy. I'll be so fixated on these teams and I knew these teams and there were two commentators there that were talking about these teams and which one stood the chance to win and as well debating back and forth. What caught my attention was one commentator said this about one team, the the other the one team he was he was thinking was going to win. He said the good thing with this team is that whether they play good or they play bad, they always win. &gt;&gt; If that can happen in the natural, what more in the spiritual you I'm looking at winners this morning. I'm looking at a bunch of winners. Whether you came gloom, whether you are sick, whatever problem you have, you are already on the winning side this morning. &gt;&gt; If God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job would say, "I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; That's what we need to confess this morning. Regardless of how sick, you know, I am, I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; No, the confession of a believer is like that of a Shunomite woman. her child was dead &gt;&gt; from heat stroke &gt;&gt; and she rode a mu to go to the to the prophet Elisha &gt;&gt; and when she got there Elisha asked her is all well with you and the the woman says all is well &gt;&gt; sometimes we glorify the devil too much &gt;&gt; you asked a question how are you feeling oh you know this is eching this is this is uh troublesome and all this we're glorifying the devil how about we say by his stripes I'm already healed. &gt;&gt; That's what we need in this hour is to shame the devil. Whatever situation you are in, my brother, whether whether whether it is financial uh whatever it is, look up to the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him hold your hand and guide your footsteps. You will get across from the other to the other shore. &gt;&gt; I can assure you of that. &gt;&gt; They that believe on him, they've already passed from death unto life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not here to bring anything new, but to encourage you like Peter says, steer up your pure minds by way of remembrance. I'm here to encourage you again to remind you that young and old, whether whatever age you are, my brother and others young young people in here, I I'm here to encourage you that if you are in the Lord, &gt;&gt; nothing can go against you. &gt;&gt; Our Lord will fight your battles. Let him fight your battles this evening. &gt;&gt; This morning, rather. How many believe the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Our God is more than able. He is that one who makes a way where there's no way. Brother Brennham says, "If God told me to go through that war, I will start walking towards that war because I know once I get there, there will be a way made for me." &gt;&gt; He's still the way maker this morning. &gt;&gt; He's still the chain breaker this morning, my brother. &gt;&gt; He's still the cycle breaker this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us come from lineages, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; that are so crooked. &gt;&gt; Don't identify yourself with that. &gt;&gt; You are of another race, my brother. &gt;&gt; You are of another blood right now. &gt;&gt; Some of us come from ancestry, ancestral glory lines, but we are prostitutes and drunkards, smokers, witchcraft. telling the people back home, don't be scared of witchcrafted wizard. Instead, they should be scared of you. &gt;&gt; There's one pastor in Muzu in Malawi there. The wizard that come wanted to enter the home. When they got to the yard, they couldn't see the house. It was all light and chariots of fire. and they caught them and took them to the police &gt;&gt; and the police were interviewing them. &gt;&gt; How come you couldn't enter? You are saying you've entered the house of this, this, this, this. How come you couldn't enter the house of this one? Says there's fire everywhere. &gt;&gt; The angels of the Lord are encamped around those that fear him. &gt;&gt; Don't worry whether you have h you have a warence or you don't have a warence. Your warance is the Lord Jesus Christ. He's the one that protects and keep you, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If the devil is trying to put a curse on you, take that curse back to him. &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong to you. Doesn't belong to your family. &gt;&gt; A child of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes he wants to bring confusion between house and w husband and wife. You know, back in Sask, we call it reading into it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought you said this. That's what you thought. That's not what I meant. Oh, okay. Back and forth. &gt;&gt; We read into things. Oh, he's dressed like that. I'm sure it must be like this. Some of us we like to compare our children &gt;&gt; with other people's children. Have you seen so and so's children? &gt;&gt; Have you seen the the way they behave up until it comes right into your your own home? &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, look up to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the one that gives us grace, my brother. and never say never. &gt;&gt; Because even the thief on the cross didn't have time to repent. He didn't have time to be baptized. But Jesus says, "Today you will be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; If that can happen to a thief on the cross, what about your children? What about your wife, your husband who've been baptized in the love of the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; May the Lord undertake for every family there. If you need blessings this morning as a preacher ordained by God, I say get your blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you need victory, get your victory today. &gt;&gt; You are children of victory in this hour. &gt;&gt; Whether the devil likes it or not, you're going to cross. &gt;&gt; And we are not going to willy-nilly cross. We are going to cross with flying colors because he who started the work in you will also finish it. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you are called of God, my brother, my sister, you will make it. &gt;&gt; Some circumstances seems like, oh, I've fallen out of grace. You can't steep so low, stoop so low, but what the hand of Jesus Christ can bring you out of there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't uh stray so far away, but what the long arm of the Lord will bring you back in line. My brother, that's the cry of the message of the hour to the bride. Stay in line. Stay in line. And if you hear or see anybody bring a message that is contrary to this message of the hour, run away from such people. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Follow me as I follow Christ." &gt;&gt; There is a catch there. So if I'm not following Christ, don't follow me. &gt;&gt; Follow the message of the hour. I say stay with the message church. &gt;&gt; That's what will bring a rapture and resurrection. It's got that power in it. &gt;&gt; Brother Gift, can I can I be forgiven? Yes, you can. As long as what you committed is not blasphemy against the Holy Ghost to say about this message that it's of the devil will not be forgiven here on earth and even in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you that delight yourself in the message of the hour. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Why am I saying these things? Move your mountain. &gt;&gt; I'm thinking about the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; The Bible says all things work together for good &gt;&gt; to them that love him and for his purpose. &gt;&gt; You believe that, brother Tabiso? &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and the way it is God works in mysterious ways &gt;&gt; and the way of the Lord are past finding out &gt;&gt; sometimes he'll take you where and lead you way this way only to bring you here &gt;&gt; and then you wonder Lord why didn't I just take a this no he's a he's not a god of shortcuts &gt;&gt; so you can't weasle your way through to heaven it has to take him &gt;&gt; that started the work in you &gt;&gt; he also finish it. He doesn't run out of resources like we do as human beings. &gt;&gt; Oh no, no. He will use the same resource to mold it and build it into a stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Our God is the greatest project manager. &gt;&gt; He knows how to manage &gt;&gt; and we are his project &gt;&gt; and we are his design. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. Is the greatest landscaper right now is just down to the finishing touches. One of these days, the prophet says it's going to take a lunatic over a glass of vodka &gt;&gt; in Russia to press the button &gt;&gt; and America will be a smothering of ashes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say like Billy Paul, God fought it. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it, I believe it, and that settles it. &gt;&gt; That's a way to believe, my brother. God said so. Abraham, you're 100 years old, but God said so. &gt;&gt; Job, you are dying with boils all over your body, but God say so. That he's my redeemer. He's my healer. &gt;&gt; You can confess that way in your life. He's my provider. He's still Jehovah Gyra. even this morning &gt;&gt; back home or preaching at a certain church and her sister didn't know where her next meal was coming from. She was down her last meal was the breakfast they had in the morning. We were preaching away under the anointing of God. You see, if you make this message personal, God will visit you at a personal level. &gt;&gt; Grandparents have their problems that are different from the teenager. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody is at different levels right now. But our God will visit you in your own situation. &gt;&gt; And for that sister, she was looking, what am I going to feed the children after church service? And she prayed and straight to the Lord. Our God is still Jehovah Gyra this morning. &gt;&gt; Some of us have lived both worlds. &gt;&gt; The jungles of Africa there and the western world. So we have the balance. We know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this sister, she prayed earnestly at the altar. When she got home, there was two bags of cornmeal and a whole bunch of groceries. And up to now she doesn't know who put those things there. He's still Jehovah Terra. If he can do that to that sister, he can do for you, my brother. My sister, &gt;&gt; we're preaching in Cape Town. And we got under anointing to the point that we started speaking. See, you can let yourself go to the point that it's no longer you talking. It's the Lord speaking through you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And right there I say to the to the point that you sisters that are in hospital maybe bedridden, if you can grasp this and take it, you brother out there who is trying cuz they were streaming the service. &gt;&gt; I say you can jump out of that bed &gt;&gt; and walk back home or go home. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These two sisters in two different words, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They heard and took it personally and they said, "If that man, I don't know that man, but he's preaching the truth." &gt;&gt; He is speaking to me right now. I take it and they gathered up strength and walked out of that hospital and &gt;&gt; and aided. &gt;&gt; Pastor was taking us home to our hotel room. I see tears streaking down his cheeks and I'm beginning to wonder, did I say something wrong or did I do anything wrong? He looked at me with tears in his eyes. He said, "You won't believe what just happened." The sisters were streaming two different words right now. They've walked. They were bedridden now. Right now, they've walked out of the hospital &gt;&gt; completely healed. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is still the healer this morning. If he can heal those sisters, he can heal you too, my brother. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. That same Jesus Christ who is in Africa is the same Jesus Christ who is here. &gt;&gt; That same devil who is here is the same devil in Africa. &gt;&gt; And that's why in this hour, God has given us the ability &gt;&gt; to receive this message and believe it and tuck it in our heart. Like David would say, "Thy word have I hid in my heart that I will not sin against thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still that kind of God. This morning, I'm here to encourage you. Start moving your mountain. Start moving your mountain. Whatever your mountain is, start saying it. &gt;&gt; If you can say, &gt;&gt; "Where are we at now?" The first pool, the first pool was good, &gt;&gt; but the second pool was greater. The second pool was really good, &gt;&gt; but the third pool was greater. &gt;&gt; I was preaching in Saskatoon on a little subject last time said, "Come up hither. That's where we need to do, my brother. Go up and live in that third pool because that's what's meant for you and me as believers of this hour." &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart. Speak it. &gt;&gt; If you have need of something now, don't just say, "I I need a tree here. I need this one. This thing here. And if you have need of something, my brother, my sister, speak the word and move forward. Don't doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; That same God will hear your heart's cry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll hear your prayer this morning. &gt;&gt; He's that kind of a God that we serve. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Just a little testimony. Bu now you hear people so much times even asking for prayer. So and so are sick. There's cancer everywhere. Diabetes. Some of you know my testimony. I was dying with diabetes in 2007 in Saskatoon there. Couldn't even lift my 2-year-old baby into my into my house in my upstairs. And I thought I was teetering between death and life. &gt;&gt; I know the ends of where I reached. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I say to the Lord, Lord, if you heal me, I'm going to stand for you and preach the best that I can and win souls for Christ. And today, I can declare I am healed by the Lord Jesus Christ. And I have more energy than I have ever had before. &gt;&gt; I can eat what I want. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can run. I can jog. I can do push-ups. 40, 50 push-ups nonstop. You young people, I challenge you. You can come see me after church this morning. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He's a God of total restoration this morning. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. You hear people say, "I want to be healed physically." That's good. But very little we hear of people asking to be healed spiritually and healing of our souls. We can be healed physically today and die tomorrow. But once your soul is healed, my brother, my sister, you are in eternity. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you notice some of you that have read maybe listened so much, there are elders in here and I give respect. Read the message left, right, center over the years. If you notice the first pool with brother Brennham was dealing more with the nominal church, Presbyterians and Baptists and all this. By 1948 when the second pool happened there in Saskatchewan in Regina, the second pool broke the descentment of the heart. The nominal churches started dropping off &gt;&gt; and Pentecostals came in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; By 1963, 62 63 when the seals were broken &gt;&gt; and we got into this third pool. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; At one time, the angel of the Lord said, "Come up hither. &gt;&gt; Let me show you how to catch the big fish." &gt;&gt; Who is the big fish? I'm looking at them right now &gt;&gt; that are fit for the master's table. This message will choke the Pentecostals to death. Right? &gt;&gt; Because it's not meat for them. But to the bride of Jesus Christ, we say, "This is fresh mana." That's for us. &gt;&gt; 1963, brother Brennham declares, he says, "From now on, I'm going to lose thousands of my friends." &gt;&gt; Sure, he did. Because there was ushering in another group of people, a special group of people, a group of people that has been selected and because they heard the shout, "Come out of her, my people. Yes. &gt;&gt; They didn't hear the trumpet because the trumpet is for Israel. &gt;&gt; They heard the shout &gt;&gt; and the shout is still going on right now to the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh, hear the shout of the Lord Jesus. Come out of high. Come up higher. Come out of that that that that first pool, second pool. Go into the third pool, my brother, where all things are possible. Right now, we should be right into the chamber and where the groom and the bride &gt;&gt; Amen. are sealed together. &gt;&gt; And the groom himself closes the door. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he closes, nobody can open. &gt;&gt; And when he opens, nobody can can can shut the door. That's our Lord Jesus Christ. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; What's your mountain this morning? &gt;&gt; I have my own mountain. I have to speak my mountain. Out of the way mountain because a child of God is coming. &gt;&gt; That's how our confession should be this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You love the Lord this morning. I'm just enjoying myself because the church is pulling so much here. I I haven't even gotten to where I need to. But we'll get there by God's grace. &gt;&gt; If I die, this is the best place to die anyway. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you're falling a short of breath, yeah, that's what we do when you you're preaching this glorious gospel. Makes you happy, makes you so energetic. Brother Brennham says, "Whatever you do, do to the best of your ability." &gt;&gt; If you're a housewife, be the best wife housewife they can be. &gt;&gt; If you're a teacher, be the best teacher. If you're a student, be a the best student. &gt;&gt; Speaking of students, I'm reminded of one pastor in Muzu in Malawi there. I'm reminded of her, of him. you know, he has uh eight children back home. Uh the more children you have, the more rich you are. I'm I'm only at three. And uh so this this one has eight. And uh I think it's the fifth born or something. He was so dull at school. That boy, he used to flank so bad. He was always last. So back home, you know how you know brother Tabiso, you know how they do back home when at the end of the term, &gt;&gt; they have to pronounce everybody who is number one to the last one and everybody's there at the assembly. &gt;&gt; Yes. So at the end of the term they would write their exams and come the end the end the day of the last day of the term and then every teacher from grade one to grade whatever they start announcing now and and and they compile the results and they come to the last one and the last one they mentioned that boy the son of a pastor and everybody used to make fun of him. &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do my prophets no harm. &gt;&gt; And this brother, the pastor, he'd be waiting at the gate for his son and he would see the gloom and doom in his son's face cuz the friends were always looking down on him. Those of you in school, put your trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the author of knowledge and wisdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This pastor one day, he had enough. Something clicked. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he had enough. He says, "This is a serious case. &gt;&gt; I have to take it up with my master. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has done wonders in my life and he can do wonders in my son. &gt;&gt; And that pastor went to pray and say, "Lord, you didn't give me a boy that was a tail &gt;&gt; and or a failure. You didn't give me that kind of a son. I'm your servant. &gt;&gt; I'm claiming him right now." Unlock &gt;&gt; something in his head. Our God can still unlock &gt;&gt; in your life. My brother, my I don't know your situation, whatever it is, he can unlock. &gt;&gt; If Satan has put a curse on you, our God is still the curse remover this morning, he can take away that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The next 10, the boy who was last was Tops and by far. Amen. &gt;&gt; And from that time he was leading the class and the school. He was on top. Today he's a doctor operating doing brain surgery. &gt;&gt; That mountain had been moved my brother. And I am witness to that. If God can do that in the flesh, what about in the spirit? You are eagles. You can soar higher. &gt;&gt; You've heard people say the sky is the limit. I don't agree with that one bit. The sky is not the limit to the believer. You can go beyond the sky. &gt;&gt; That's just human science &gt;&gt; and they are 17% correct most of the time. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Just like the weatherman. &gt;&gt; But our God is 100%. &gt;&gt; And our God is not a 50% God. He's not a 75. When he heals you, he heals you completely. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't compromise with the enemy to get the other 50%. No, no, no. Mountain be thou moved. &gt;&gt; I want everything because in this message winner takes it all. &gt;&gt; We don't have room for the devil. &gt;&gt; Ah, what's your mountain to the to to you today? If you say to this mountain, then there's another phrase there. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We hear brother Brennham using it all the time during discernment time. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Ah I'm speaking to myself. God give me that faith that I can move my mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once I move my mountain I can help my my brother my sister to move their mountain too. &gt;&gt; How would we do that? We can do that by testimony. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a a a country youth camp back home and and and screams everywhere and people touched the youth where and one sister came and gave testimony of how she was delivered and that triggered another sister, another brother, another you see the enemy likes to keep our testimonies kept up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Speak it. Let somebody know because somebody might be suffering with the same situation and when they hear you testify of the goodness of the Lord. They can also rise up and say, "Lord, that's for me as well." &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here right now to undertake for each and everyone. Yes, the prophet is gone, but the angel of the Lord is here. The pillar of fire is here. How do I know? &gt;&gt; The prophet says when we come to church, each one bring a lick of fire. Lick of fire. Once everybody brings their licks of fire, it makes the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Our God is the undertaker for every believer. &gt;&gt; Whatever your situation, he will make impossibilities possible. &gt;&gt; Because with God, nothing is impossible. &gt;&gt; When you hear you young people say, "Oh, your family line, you can't go any further. This is as far as you can go." Tell the devil, "That's a bunch of nonsense. I belong to another race now. I'm a super race. I'm a super seed. And you might have done that to my lineage, but you're not going to do that to me &gt;&gt; cuz I'm a child of the living God. Get out of that cocoon and pip your way out of there and free yourself by the blood of Jesus Christ and the spirit of God that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; My brother G. Spirit of God dwelleth in me. How do I know? You know when you have the spirit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody has to tell you that you have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Bible says the spirit of God beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah this morning. &gt;&gt; Ah I'm here to encourage you my brother my sister that you know if something has happened in your life don't let the setbacks of yesterday bring you down. We are not the Romans chapter 7 people lamenting lamenting oh poor wretched soul oh me this me that there are people who are always beating down themselves beating those oh I'm I'm no good you know the way I'm looking the way I'm performing them and it's all all negative negative negative negative &gt;&gt; ah God doesn't delight in negative people &gt;&gt; God delights in people that show positivity &gt;&gt; to say yes I know I don't have it but I'll get it Yes. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm walking into that promise &gt;&gt; because it's mine, my brother. &gt;&gt; That's what a confession of a believer should be. If the devil says you can't, you say, "Yes, I can." &gt;&gt; Because Paul says, "I can do all things through Jesus Christ that strengthens me." &gt;&gt; That's the work of the believer. &gt;&gt; That's the walk of a true believer this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded of Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's gone to get the children of Israel. On one hand, God has packed Moses with miracles. But how do those miracles work? How are they going to be exhibited? God has a plan. While he has packed Moses with miracles, he has also hardened the heart of Pharaoh. It's God who did that. &gt;&gt; Even says, "For this reason I created you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To harden your heart. &gt;&gt; So that my miracles can come to to to fruition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and so Pharaoh's heart is so hard. He won't listen. Release the children. Nor you're not going anywhere. But the fleas started coming in. The frogs and everything. Oh, Pharaoh starts to see this is this is something else now. Let me strike a deal. You don't strike a deal with the enemy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; This message is a one-man commando. &gt;&gt; It's a gorilla warfare. &gt;&gt; It's not a group thing. Yes, we are a group here, but we are individuals &gt;&gt; before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to fight your own battles. I have to fight mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; With my Lord on my side, &gt;&gt; Moses begins to perform all these miracles and Pharaoh says, "Oh, uh, what about you leave your your elderly and the the sickly and the children?" And Moses says, "No, we are not leaving everybody. Not even a hoof will be left behind. &gt;&gt; We are going everybody." That's what a child of the living God, that's what a real soldier does. He fights for himself and fights for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they got out of there. God had said, "Look, follow the pillar of fire and let the children of Israel follow you. There is an order in how things are done." &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Follow them. Go to the and lead them right to the dead end. Don't despair my brother. &gt;&gt; Sometimes might seem like dark &gt;&gt; but victory comes &gt;&gt; in the morning. &gt;&gt; Might be so dark sometimes in your life. &gt;&gt; You don't know where to do &gt;&gt; or where to go. In front of them was the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Behind them was Pharaoh soldiers. &gt;&gt; On the side were steep mountains. And on the other side, steep valleys, nohere to go. Sometimes we get ourselves into situations like that. Don't despair. That's the time. Be still and let the salvation of the Lord take over. &gt;&gt; Don't be frustrated now. &gt;&gt; Just stand still on the word of God. &gt;&gt; On Christ, the solid solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. Now &gt;&gt; stay right there and say, "Lord, you who has led me yesterday will lead me today will lead me tomorrow." &gt;&gt; Through many dangers, toils and snares that have been disgrace has brought me this far. &gt;&gt; Grace will lead me home. &gt;&gt; They stood there and started crying to Moses. &gt;&gt; Moses cried to God. And God said, "Come over here, Moses." When God have to deal with you, he'll pull you away from everybody. &gt;&gt; Catch the vision and follow the vision of God. And if it's really God in it, he'll make it happen. &gt;&gt; He'll make a way for you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And as they stood there, Moses, God says, "Come over here, Moses." You say, "Why are you crying to me? &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward." &gt;&gt; What's that in your heart? Yeah, &gt;&gt; let a stick strike the waters and part the waters. &gt;&gt; I was asking the church over in Edmonton. I said it a thought struck, what formula did God use &gt;&gt; to stop the word and resist? What tension? What resistance? &gt;&gt; How can you calculate it? &gt;&gt; What formula did he use? to dry the Red Sea because the Bible says they walked on dry ground. &gt;&gt; What formula did God use for you, my brother, for you, my sister, to say this is the word of God, this message of the hour? I receive it. I I I I believe it. &gt;&gt; So, we decided to ask Uncle Google. We said, "What what could be the formula?" Those of you that have done physics, nobody, all those young people could answer that. Let's let's ask uh Uncle Google cuz he's the one they say is the smartest. &gt;&gt; The greatest one is our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's never been anybody like him before. &gt;&gt; And somebody typed in a young man, very good, smart at physics, typed in and Google came up with an answer. And the answer was it is impossible &gt;&gt; to answer such kind of a question. &gt;&gt; But to God everything is possible my brother. &gt;&gt; God has the answer. I'm sure when we go to the marriage supper of the lamb we can ask that question. What was the formula you used? &gt;&gt; And it's very simple. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; He spoke. If you can say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; be moved and you don't doubt in your heart, it will move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's your red sea this morning, my brother? What's your mountain? What's your valley this morning? Rise up again as a child of the living God and say, "As for my mountain, it has already started moving." Right as you walk out of this church, walk with your head high up and say, "I'm a child of the living God. &gt;&gt; I am going with praises of God. I don't care how I'm feeling. I don't care how bad I am. I don't care how disappointed I am, but I'm a child of the living God. I am moving forward and speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the God of William Brennham. He's still working in source. May he enlighten you more and more. May he rise you up to a level that you will be rapture ready. I'll be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Driving to Calgary. huge farms right now with wheat. And as a plant soil scientist myself, I know one or two things about it. The wheat, the grain has to be at a certain moisture level &gt;&gt; and protein content for it to be taken into the can &gt;&gt; and be stored properly so it doesn't spoil. Mhm. Mhm. &gt;&gt; My wife was asking me says, "How come all these fields are not harvested yet?" I say, "They are waiting. They're watching &gt;&gt; for the wheat to completely ripen &gt;&gt; and be ready for harvest to put into the Ghana." &gt;&gt; And if that's happening right now, and we saw some of them now, they've started the combines like that song that say I can hear the combines coming. I tell you my brother, some of them, they go 24/7 nonstop harvesting that crop. &gt;&gt; What do you think God is doing right now to the bride of Jesus Christ? He's combining now. He's going 24/7. Our God is a 24/7 God. &gt;&gt; You can approach him any time of the day. &gt;&gt; The phone lines are open. You can talk to him anytime. My brother, my sister, is that kind of a God. Ah, we about to be harvested now. I say if you're not in, my brother, my sister, you young people, get in quickly. Get in quickly. Get in quickly and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He's calling. He's beckoning right now. If you are off a beaten path somewhere, come quickly. Come right back. You know, repentance is if you're going in this direction and you are wrong. All you have to do is turn around, start going into the right in in the right direction. That's all God is looking for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He won't condemn you. He won't condemn me. He asked that woman, "Woman, where are thine accusers? &gt;&gt; Looked up and said, "They're all gone." &gt;&gt; He says, "Neither do I condemn them. &gt;&gt; Go away and sin no more, &gt;&gt; lest the worst thing come upon you." &gt;&gt; That's a kind of God. He's a God of merciful God this morning. &gt;&gt; What's your mountain? What's your What's your Red Sea? Watch. They crossed on dry ground. &gt;&gt; And what was the time? How much time did God calculate for the last one with all their belongings for the last one to climb up out of that dry ground and for him to unleash the water upon the children of uh of Pharaoh only God knows. &gt;&gt; Notice as soon as they crossed over there was jubilee in the camp. There was a revival in the camp and Miriam took the tambourine was playing and and all the sisters followed her and there was such a jubilee. It didn't take long. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; 3 days &gt;&gt; of journey. Here they were without water. &gt;&gt; They were thirsty. They wanted water. All of a sudden they come to this body of water and and and they tried to drink but the bo the water was bitter. started complaining and murmuring. Brother Paul, my theme this year 2025 has been start stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Start claiming. &gt;&gt; Stop complaining. Start claiming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stop pointing fingers at each other. &gt;&gt; Something goes wrong, it's always somebody else's fault. &gt;&gt; We don't introspect. We don't know. We don't even think whether we are the cause. of that problem. Let me search my heart. And everybody search their heart and come to the Lord quickly and say, "Lord, forgive me." &gt;&gt; If a prophet of God could do that and ask and say, "God, forgive your stupid servant." &gt;&gt; We can also do that. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother gift that hurts a little bit. That's a way of a missionary. That's a wear of an evangelist. It's not always just oh wiping. But I'm here to encourage you, not to shoot you down. But if you are wrong, if I'm wrong, let's rise up again. Get hold of the word of God and say, Lord, here I am. Be it unto me according to thy will. &gt;&gt; That's a way of a true believer. &gt;&gt; Humility. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; Down where? Down on your knees. &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's what we are here. Oh, something goes wrong. work very quick to pull the trigger. Blend the pastor. Blend the deacons. What about what about me? &gt;&gt; Lord, am I the one that's causing? &gt;&gt; Rise up. Let this church rise up higher, higher, higher. I'm not saying you're not higher already, but God keeps moving. He keeps going higher, higher. Because why? We are the Enoch people. Keep Enoch kept on walking until God, brother Brenam says you're so far where you've come from. Where you are going is much closer. come up hither &gt;&gt; until Enoch was taken up. &gt;&gt; We are the type of Enoch. We are not the type of Noah, but we are the type of Enoch. One day, somebody in here will walk off of this earth without dying. &gt;&gt; We will defy gravity. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother G, gravity won't be there. It will be there, but we'll defy it &gt;&gt; as a children of the living God. In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, these bow bodies will be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; God, if there's anybody in this assembly, if there's one going, let it be me. &gt;&gt; That should be your prayer. And if one says the same another, a whole bunch of you will be taken up here &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's where we are. We are the people of Revelation 10:7. We are the people of Luke uh 17:30. We are the people, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of Malachi 456. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the people who can associate ourselves and place ourselves right in the scripture and say, "Lord, I see myself right there. That's me, my Lord. &gt;&gt; Start confessing in that way &gt;&gt; cuz God love to hear your confession." &gt;&gt; No matter how tough things are, he can you can confess it and he can hear that confession and he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; What's my subject? Move your mountain this morning. &gt;&gt; Move it. &gt;&gt; Move your mountain in your family. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Husband and wife, move that mountain &gt;&gt; that's in between. &gt;&gt; Families, move that mountain. &gt;&gt; Whatever trouble, even you as an individual, me as an individual. Sometimes we are conflicted within ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; That's a mountain in itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that mountain move. House of hell, give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's still happening today, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; Move your mountain. &gt;&gt; And Moses cried to the Lord. Say, Lord, what do I do? They don't this water is not drinkable. And God called Moses aside. You see that tree over there? Cut that tree down &gt;&gt; and throw it into that body of water. Moses did as as as prescribed by the Lord and he put the water there. I can the tree there. I can assume he was the one to test the water first. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the water that was bitter was turned into sweet water. &gt;&gt; They called that the water of Mara. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, if that's the Old Testament. Yes. But it's the shadow of things that were to come right now. What is that water of mara in your life? &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's health related problems, may God sweeten that and turn it into the sweet waters of mara this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever affliction is in your life, whatever thoughts, you know, we are in a time that people &gt;&gt; have gone mind crazy &gt;&gt; get to a stage young and old alike where you're talking to yourself. And when you asked what you're saying, you don't even know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; You young people serve the Lord with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Testify. Feel the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. M &gt;&gt; there may come a time &gt;&gt; that you are looking for your car keys and yet they in your hands. &gt;&gt; There may come come a time that you are looking for your phone and yet you're talking on the phone. &gt;&gt; There may come a time that you will move from one room to another and you forget what you went there for. &gt;&gt; So while you have your mind serve the Lord with all your heart. &gt;&gt; This message is calling for you to serve him. Rise up. If you are the people, you are the young people with so much energy right now. Testify of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Don't be shy of this message at school. If they ask you what you believe, you tell them you believe this end time message that was brought forth by a mighty prophet. &gt;&gt; William Mariam Brenham &gt;&gt; God chose as a vessel &gt;&gt; to bring the end time message to this. I always go wherever I go I say stay with the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; If brother gift is not preaching the truth, you stay with the truth. You don't have to follow what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth, my brother, because this truth will reach you home &gt;&gt; to get you home. &gt;&gt; Stand with the message of the hour. We don't need another message. We already have thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't need another messenger because the church ages are over. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to these fly by night ministers &gt;&gt; with little little gifts. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can pray for the sick. We have a measuring h yard stick now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and say, "What are you feeling? What what's your problem?" And all that. No, you tell me what my problem is. Right? &gt;&gt; That's the kind of prophet that I'm looking for that if you want to compare, you tell me your name is gift marufu and and your parents were such and such. You were born in such a place. This happened 10 years ago to you and if there's sin in your life, you did this and that. Make it right and you shall be made whole. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's the prophet of the hour that we have heard. Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet that would tell you because God in the Bible says &gt;&gt; before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you &gt;&gt; and I ordained you a prophet. You've been ordained to be believers of this age. No matter what the devil, whether he likes it or not, there's a group of people that have been given the ability to actually believe it. &gt;&gt; You flash this message to somebody else, &gt;&gt; no interest because why? There's no identification there. &gt;&gt; But to you in your hearts, there's identification, my brother, that can press your souls right to back to eternity. &gt;&gt; Now we know where we coming from. We know where we at. We know where we are going. You can trace this and say, "How did this message strike me?" &gt;&gt; Poor little fellow like me in the jungles of Africa there. &gt;&gt; Quickened my my heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. And from that time, I have never looked back. My brother, though none go with me, yet still I'll follow. I've decided to follow Jesus. This message is like honey in the rock for me. This message is my typost. &gt;&gt; And kept down there at the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. We got into the ocean there. We were picking muscles and they were going to cook for us those muscles and they come with salt, sea salt. And when we went to pluck them out from the rock, they were so stuck to the rock, you had a hard time to pluck them out. Some of them were so tight, we couldn't pluck them out. On Christ, the solid rock I stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be like that muscle and stand right there on Christ. And when we tried to pluck them out, no ways &gt;&gt; we did manage to get some for cooking. But I couldn't I couldn't help it but think if a little creature like that would know where to stick itself so that when the waves of the Atlantic Atlantic Ocean come bashing on the shore, those things are still intact. &gt;&gt; They won't move. They won't bite for nothing. What about you and me as a Christian standing on the rock Christ Jesus this morning? We can stay right there and say he's certain I'm not moving no matter how many trials and tribulations. Brother Brandham says the best thing that ever happened to a Christian is trials and tribulations. &gt;&gt; You can search it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to live with you cuz I know that before I preach that I feted my thoughts &gt;&gt; through the urum thumb &gt;&gt; which is the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and when it pleases him and that I know I'm in line &gt;&gt; then like brother Brennham says I've preached what Paul preached &gt;&gt; I can also say I've preached what brother Brennham preached. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. exposition of seven church ages. You know, there are no paragraphs in there, but I'll drop in where it says, "Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There we are. &gt;&gt; Are we different from the old time saints? No, sir. &gt;&gt; This message is one. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, &gt;&gt; making it look warm. Brother Brenham says this, "The first Eve fell because the enemy got to her first. The second Eve fell because the enemy got to her first. But this third ef will not fall. &gt;&gt; That's you and me, my brother. &gt;&gt; Because why? The word got to her first. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows that and and making it look formal and powerless. &gt;&gt; Yes. It exposes Satan, revealing his work, attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word &gt;&gt; right down to the time he's cast into the lack of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation &gt;&gt; of the true church, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and what it is, what she is, what she stands for, and that she can do greater works, She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know invincible I went to searching on that word. It means undefeated. &gt;&gt; Can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit design and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood his his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan hates revelation, but we love it. &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, &gt;&gt; but we will prevail over them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wanted to leave you with that. You will prevail over every devil, every enemy. If you're a child of God, speak the word. Mountain, move out of the way. I'm a child of the living God. And that mountain will have to give way. The Red Sea in your life in front of you will have to give way. Whatever the devil has, whatever mechanization, I hear the Bible says no weapon, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; no weapon formed against you shall prosper. Yes, the weapons will be formed against you, but they will not prosper. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; that's the declaration of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Don't you love the Lord this morning to know you on the winning side? To know that you can move your mountain, whatever it is on a daily basis, you're a winner. &gt;&gt; I'm a winner. &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church of the living God. May God, Almighty God, watch over you, every family. And if we don't meet on this side of the world, may we meet across each other at the marriage supper of the lamb. I honestly believe that every prophecy that has been spoken in this hour will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Just the way it's been said. &gt;&gt; I don't care what internet is a wash with people criticizing this message and the messenger. I am saying they are too late, my brother. They might burn our Bibles. They might take the message books away from us, but they will not take that which is in my heart already. &gt;&gt; I've been born again. &gt;&gt; And if anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am redeemed &gt;&gt; cuz I've been purchased and bought of the blood of Jesus Christ this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to be identified as one of them. One of them. I'm so glad to be identified that in this hour I'll be an overcomer. I'm already an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says those whom he forneew, he already predestinated. And those he predestinated, he he he justified as if you never did anything. &gt;&gt; Those he justified, he sanctified. And those he sanctified, he has already glorified right now, not tomorrow. You are already glorified this morning. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it does not appear what we shall be. But now are we sons and daughters of God. Oh yeah. They might laugh at us. You sisters, they might laugh at how you dress and how you do your hair. Just stand right there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm a child of the living God. I was born for a testimony in this hour that we live in. I don't care what you look at me, how you look at me, what I care about it, how he looks at me." &gt;&gt; That's what we should be about our father's business this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. One of them, one of them as the musicians would come. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you're one of them this hour &gt;&gt; that you can say, "Lord, I'm in that number that John saw." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my sister. One of them. One of them. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your yesterday. Don't even worry about your tomorrow today. &gt;&gt; God has you covered. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your setbacks of yesterday. Rather make those setbacks &gt;&gt; be setups for comebacks so you can bounce back again and give victory and say your testimony of how God has been good to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of them. One of them. I can And I can say I'm one of them. Oh, one of them. One of them. I'm so glad I can say, "Oh, one of them. One of them. [Music] I'm so glad I'm one of them. Oh, one. I'm so glad that I can say there are people [Music] who [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Sweet [Music] as well as [Music] free. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] coming forth to carry me home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did the Lord speak to your heart this morning? &gt;&gt; Then I have just one question for you. Are you ready to take your God-given position and start speaking to your condition? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you able to flounce your identity before the devil &gt;&gt; and speak to your situation this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm not calling for a prayer meeting. But if that God who spoke this morning is your personal God, then you can approach him anytime, anywhere. &gt;&gt; And so now you have the word in your hand, he's spoken to you, you have a right to take his word back to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's give a hand. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know this is the time of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so the sign that you are called into this, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; is that you assume your position and speak to your condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. You speak to the condition at home, the condition at school, the condition at church, the condition at work, everywhere. You speak to the condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is our call for this season. Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; Um let's bow our hearts before him.
