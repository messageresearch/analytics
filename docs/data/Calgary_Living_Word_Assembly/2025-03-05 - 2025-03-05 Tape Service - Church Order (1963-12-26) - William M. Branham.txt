name of the Lord Jesus Christ do we pray amen thank you very much are you glad to be in his presence amen at the very least you can look into the Bible and say you have responded to his call amen amen you don't ever come before him and lose anything anyway I'm just going to um mention a few announcements here uh March 13th Thursday coming Thursday I think 7:30 is a prayer meeting and then March 23rd 5:30 that's communion so Sunday morning Sunday evening communion and uh just a a friendly reminder Daylight Saving Time begins Saturday into Sunday and so um 1 hour we move our clock 1 hour ahead so if you come at a regular 9:30 you'll be 1 hour late so just be mindful of that amen uh please let's have our seats uh like the pastor already announced um we'll be listening to uh Church order today and I think uh it's very important that uh we listen to these things together to so that it's not as if uh somebody's bringing something from somewhere no it's what has been given to us now you understand that if we came all the way here you probably passed by many churches before you got here and there is something that set apart if you ever want to please somebody I think the best way to please the person is to ask the person how and here is the Lord himself coming down to tell us how to serve him how to worship Him how to pleas him I remember we're not trying to copy from how some great denomination did their thing we are not even looking at oh Braham Tabernacle yeah but Braham was there no we are looking at how God wants us to do it amen and as we look at it like the every word of God when it comes it comes with the power to fulfill it and so we are that special people who have been called to do it this way amen that man did not declare it to all the they didn't go around say who can do this and do that and do that and that woman who does that I'll marry her no first of all he called us and I said you are my own this is how I want things to be and so it's good that we all in humility listen and pray for strength there's quite a lot in there for deons um but I think today the good thing is we're doing just about half so it won't be very long and so people will be able to close early so let's just give it all our Focus give it all our attention and may the Lord bless you you be ready to turn them off I motion my head to you like that my motion my head to you Breen we've call this meeting together here tonight for the purpose of knowing how that to operate the Church of the Living God which we believe to be a part of this church and I want to first thing I want to say that in my travels around the world so far as I know this is one h of the most spiritual places where you feel the spirit of God more than any other place I know I had two other places in mine that used to be but so far we we don't uh seem to see those places one of them has went into the organization and the other has uh has kind of fallen so uh I was called uh yesterday and was was told me that you all wanted a meeting to ask me these questions concerning your duties in this church and I um that's what I'm here for tonight is in to set the church or to give to you the things that I think that that is what's substantial to make this church to continue on Brethren I'm sure that you do realize that is I've made this remark about uh this being a spiritual place it isn't the biggest place in the world and it isn't what we have the most singing the most screaming and the most hollering or the most speaking in tongues and that isn't it but it's the quality of the spirit that's operates here in this Tabernacle and so far I want to command and thank brother Neville and and you Brethren here trustees and deacons and Sunday school superintendent and all for for what you have done and helping keeping this us away it's been a long prayer a mind and a desire since a boy to see the church put in order and kept in order now we dedicated the church I told you a little later I had something to talk to you about how to set this thing in order the way it should be run and um you started off uh after leaving here we had ministers and so forth but now brother Neville being just young Among Us come Among Us I thought it'd be better for brother Neville to get better established in the faith before I presented such things as I'm about to do now but now after I find out that he is uh getting well established in the faith and understands what the doctrine is and and has uh played the part of a faithful witness to Christ and holding for what we believe to be the truth I think it's the hour now would be a good time to approach him and among you elders and things for the church that you would take these orders and remember them they're the best of my knowledge before God and then I'm looking to you to carry these things out the way that I'm seeing because somebody has to be a head around here you have to have now I'm not trying to assert Authority or something like that but you see a man or anything with two heads to it it it doesn't know how to go God never did have two heads to his church he never did it's one head he always dealt in every generation as we've studied through the scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two men you got two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word and I will I know you are brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute to what as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scripture you follow me as I follow Christ and then I'd expect you Brethren at any time that you see me to get away from this scripture to come to me privately and tell me or I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the trusties if you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bound to me as a brother in Christ to tell me when I'm wrong scripturally if it's a question let's sit down and solve it out together that's why you've come I suppose to me tonight brought me in here is because that there's questions here that seems to be questioning you in your your mind for the things that I have have here I remember Brethren I don't know there's no name signed on any of these tickets but and they're wrote and I can't don't know who wrote them but their questions that's on your mind and I'm here to answer them the best of my knowledge and remember God is looking to me to see that I stay in the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word see in this church and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow and the LA and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits you're age soldiers now I've been trained to fight and Satan will come among you cause you to dispute with one another if you can turn him down just immediately youing breing and it's the enemy and we're here to hold a standard in this evening light time that when the world is darken and the whole church kingdom is going into the Council of churches and pretty soon they'll try to tack a sign on this door you're closed then we're going to have to meet other places because they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and uh we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we intend to do now straight to the and I would ask that if ever a time that any of these things come into question that this tape may be played before the members of this church at your meetings or prayer of the meeting just before the meeting starts turn this tape on and play it and may the congregation here understand that these men are Duty bound to God is there oath in this church to help hold these principles you may disagree with them and if I let you run it then I disagree with you we've got to have some Source somewhere where there's got to be an ultimate and the best that I know I'm giving it under the Holy Spirit letting him be my ultimate and let this P be your ultimate on these questions now the first one is how shall the church act towards calls for financial help uh for food and clothing what's what act what what should the church do now we realize that the church is responsible for its own for our members here of the church we are are totally responsible as far as we have needs to supply them with we are responsible for our own that's steady constant members of the Tabernacle come here and worship with us we are Duty bound to them as our brothers and sisters who have proven to be our members of this Gathering now we realize that there is millions tonight without food without without clothing and we would love to be able to help the whole group of them to do everything we could but financially we cannot do that we can't support all the world but we are Duty bound to our own and I think in that and then if we have anything left over that you would want to contribute to people who are not members here of this church something that you want to give to them it should be met between the the board of the deacons the deacons is the one that that has to meet this opposition or this problem rather because that in the Bible when the dispute come up about food and clothing and so forth in the book of Acts they call the apostles in about it they said go look out for yourself uh s a man of honest report and full of the Holy ghost that they might attend to these things because we will give ourselves continually to the word of God and in prayer and it isn't the pastor's duty to look out to the uh for the food and so forth that's supposed to be by the deacons it isn't the trustees it is the Deacon's office to do this and then this should be remember in the Bible they was contributing to their own the Greeks and the and the Jewish where the argument come up that one was getting a little more than the other but it was people who had sold all their goods and given into the church for its support and then to to be divided out among them equally and there was a little dispute come up and there's where we got our first deacons and that's one of their duties is to do that I think that as our own as our own people uh we should take care of them and it should be turned in any complaint to the chairman of the deacon board and then it should be met by the Deacon board and see what they're able to do about it and all of those things which is clothing and food and financial help or whatever it is should come through the deacons then the deacons when they decide that they are that they are what they're going to do about it then it should be presented then unto the uh the treasure the SE if the treasure is able at this time to pay this certain amount of Finance or or buy these clothing or whatever it is to that but the the Deacon board should meet on that and it doesn't go to the trustees or to the pastor it's a Deacon's thing altoe now then question number two is it s sufficient to say openly from the pulpit that tongues and interpretation should be done in a meeting before the service that's the second question on this uh slip of paper that I have here which is a little card now this would be uh pertaining to the pastor here see because he after all over the spiritual part he's the head of that deacons are policemen in the church to keep order and to take care of these things and feeding the poor and so forth the trustees are over the Finance in the building that's what they he to look at but the pastor is over the the supervising of the spiritual part and this would go to you brother nible now there some time ago when the uh order was set the church uh I do believe in speaking in tongues and interpretation and all the fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of God to be in the church but we are living in a day just like it was in the Bible time where the churches now you notice Paul he founded the church at Ephesus the Ephesian Church which is a wellestablished church did you notice we believe that Paul and did say so himself that he spoke with many tongues and we know that he had gifts of tongues not ones that he had learned but those who were spiritually given to him because High speaks it in Corinthians there and the same time I'm not just turning in the Bible and reading it for you because it would make our our stay here too long tonight as I don't have too much time and now but just so that you could openly see now uh Paul never one time had to speak to the Ephesian church or to the Roman church or any of those other churches about their spiritual gifts about how to put them in order but he did have to speak to the Corinthians continually about it because they made it an issue all the time and Paul said when he come among them if uh they found out one had a tongue and one had a Psalm and he thanked the Lord for all their fine gifts and things like that and if you notice in the first chapter or two of Corinthians Paul was telling positionally what they were in Christ how he they were positionally in Christ then after he told him L like a father he be to let the whip down on him and say I hear hear there contentions among you and I hear that you get drunk at the Lord's table he didn't UNC christianize them and don't you Brethren do that un christianize them but it's the way they're behaving themselves in the house of God that's where it said now I would say this that as Paul of old said that when you come together if one speaks let another uh interpret there be no interpreter then hold your peace but if there be an interpreter now I've watched The church here and I've seen you grow up I've seen many spiritual gifts operating among you frankly one I had to come to brother neev about with a word from the Lord to correct him on something that he was doing and if I if the Lord is the Holy Ghost is made me an overseer of the flock then it's my duty to tell you the truth and I'm very grateful for brother Neville he heeded to the truth I can only say it as he tells me now on this as I've noticed your church growing and noticed it and in the church here's the way we had it first and this the way we we want it again now if you don't watch when babies the first thing a baby does is try to talk when he can't talk he makes a lot of bubble and noise and and so forth but he thinks he's just he can out talk the preacher at that time well we find that not only in the natural life but we find that in the spiritual life also it's a little one and if you try to correct that baby and spank him a little bit because he gooing and trying to talk you'll ruin the child and you'll hurt him and it's best to let that baby grow a little while until he actually can speak his words right and then tell him when not when Papa's talking or When Mama's talking but when it's appropriate time let him have his say you understand me now let him talk when his time comes to talk now if I've ever had anything that's been a thorn in my flesh out in the meeting is someone to rise up when I'm speaking and then give a message in tongues and break the spirit I've just come out a meeting in New York and different places to where ministers let that go on time after time and it's nothing but but a confusion see when God is dealing in one line of thought he it would be it would he would be defeated meting his own purpose if he's trying to get a line of thought to you to the congregation to make an alar calling something bu him for instance like this we're sitting at the table talking and we're talking uh about the Lord and Junior runs into the table real quick takes all the attention away from what we're doing and hollers scream out dad mom m I just hit a home run down the team and we doing all this that and the other and when we're right on a real write down sacred subject now him hitting a home run that's all right at the baseball game that's all right but he's out of order when he breaks in on the message that we're talking about let him wait till his time comes and then tell us what he did at the baseball game now that's just the same thing we find with gifts today that's the reason God cannot trust to many spiritual gifts with people they don't know how to control them that's what's the matter today the reason we don't have no more than we do and we do find there's a lot of impersonation of spiritual gifts but I don't believe that's so here in our church I'm thankful for that I don't believe it's an impersonation at all I believe we have genuine gifts but we must know how to control those gifts then when you go to doing something good just like you working for a boss and you start out on the first year job and you're willing to take orders then the boss has confidence in you and will'll keep raising you up to a higher office all the time I believe that time has struck the random Tabernacle to know what to take the gifts that God gives us that God can trust us with something even greater and what we have got but we cannot uh go along and you see a man that's always have to be tell him and everything and remember the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet says the scripture when you see a man that you have to correct or a woman and that person gets out of order and then you're telling him the scriptural truth then it shows that the spirit that's on him isn't of God because the Bible said the spirit of the prophets are prophesying that's testifying preaching speaking in tongues or whatever it is C tongues interpreted is prophecy so it's subject to the prophet and the word is the prophet so we we see that it's out of order for a man or woman to jump up and give a message no matter how much they want to do it while a preacher is in the Pulpit now I suggest this for the brandom Tabernacle that being that our our gifts that we find and we have some very fine gifted people here now each one of those gifts are a Ministry of their own they are gifts just like preaching is a gift like healing is a gift like other things are gifts these are gifts they are Ministries all their own and each man is commanded to wait on his own Ministry therefore let the brand of tabernac will be operated like this and in the day especially this day when we've had so much um I don't want to say this but so much make belief we don't want make belief no man no honest person wants to have a make belief we if we don't can't have the real let's not have any at all let's wait till we do get the real I believe you you man would agree with that we don't want nothing make believe brethren we can't start on make believe something and leave in this world we got to have what's real what's genuine if we haven't got it let's wait till we do get it and then say something about it see now I would say let all these men and women who speak in tongues and prophesy and give messages and I I'm believing with you man if they are genuine now the Bible has said prove all things and hold fast to that what's good for with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak to this people this is the rest that I said that they should enter into over in the book of Isaiah now I would suggest this so that the sanctuary will only be ministered by one gift at a time for it brings us straight back in order again of what I'm trying to say if one Speaking let the spirit of the prophets be subject to the prophet do you understand now let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ and now it's being said now let it be done let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ wait on their Ministry because it is a Ministry from Christ to the church but you can't all Minister the same time there's got to be one at a time the Brandon Tabernacle should be like this let those who speak with tongues and those who interpret tongues and those have prophecy that's to be given to the church let them come among among themselves early in the before the meeting starts let them Gather in an appointed room and wait on the ministry of the Lord as the pastor has to do himself before he comes into the audience he must take the Bible study in the quietness of his room in the spirit and be anointed to come out before the audience to speak if he doesn't he's going to be confused when he gets out out there let each man and each woman with a spiritual gift come before the Lord and being that the pastor has a single Ministry he is a prophet the English word a preacher means a prophet that's a fourth teller of the word let those who have Ministries that has to be part of someone else like one to speak with tongues and another to interpret they they wait together on their Ministry they cannot stay in a private study and speak in tongues and then come tell the other what he said because he'd have both tongues and interpretation now if he has that very well we want it to receive it like that and we want the church to benefit by these gifts that's in our church God sent them to us and it's we want our church to benefit by these spiritual gifts so let the man who speaks with tongues and the one who interprets and the one who prophesies let them come together before the the church ever meets let them meet in a room to themselves waiting on the ministry of the Lord to the church is it understood and then like this if brother Neville say well I let me pardon me let me say this if brother Collins speaks with Tong and brother Hickerson gives the interpretation then they have a Ministry together for the church now that isn't the ministry of brother nabal that's your ministry to the church I'm giving this as example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as the pastor Pastor is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it but you can't do it in the privacy of your own room if you speak and you interpret you've got to come together now come together in the church off in a room to yourself because you have a private Ministry it's not an openly Ministry it's one that's to help the church see it's something to help the church but it isn't to be done in the main congregation only the way I'm going to tell you is to be done see then whatever brother Collins speaks and brother Hickerson gives the interpretation as example then let brother uh somebody write this down what it is and then if it's coming now we all know that the Lord is coming we're aware of that and if brother Neville got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right see but he's saying that the pastor at the platform for he's got the word for that and if he be a pastor Prophet to the church or Pastor rather he's to study the word of the Lord and tell you what's written in the word of the Lord about the coming of the Lord and you're warned by that a Ministry otherwise to the church which he wouldn't have any connection with is tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's something is not written in the word what's written in the word he's to bring it but what's not written in the word is what you're to tell him like for instance uh tell um brother wheeler of thus sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his sandpit not to go to it because you'll be a truck turnover or something like that and it's got to be done and you've spoken and he's interpreted and then lay that on the platform after your ministry is finished the other night after the church the hymn starts singing and so forth if your ministry is finished then let them come forth with what prophecy has been given and I do not think that we have or if you do put this in there when these people meet together let them who have wisdom first come because you see if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation according to scripture that cannot be received unless be uh witnessed by two or three people two or three more witnesses see has to witness to that that they believe it to be the word of the Lord because sometimes in these minor Ministries just like in any other Ministry you get Spirits that's wrong see they'll fly in there and we don't want that no we want these Ministries ready to be exposed if they to be exposed because anything of God can don't worry about exposing it it'll it'll stand the test if it's of God it's like the pastor if somebody challenges him on the word he don't have to back up about it you know just exactly what he's talking to come on up here see and same as these other Ministries got to be the same way now if if one speaks in tongues and gives a message now some people speak in tongues when they're just edifying themselves the Bible say they just have a good time to speak in tongues they feel and they do speak in tongues they actually speak with tongues and it's the spirit doing it but if it's sitting out there in the audience of speaking in tongues just edifying themselves then it isn't any profitable thing for the church the man's edifying himself or the woman whoever is doing it see to speak in tongues as a gift of God to edification as Paul says in the scripture that it's to edify the church so it had to be some direct message from God to the church outside of what's wrote here in the Bible see it's something if you could ask me brother brandom uh how must I be baptized I can tell you right quick you don't have to speak in tongues and tell me that it's wrote right here in the Bible what to do about that see I don't have you don't have to ask no questions on that have somebody speak in tongues and tell you see that's already written but if you say brother Brandon uh what must I do I've got a decision here I've got to make whether I should U uh take this church or go to another church or something like that or should I do this now that have to come from God see God has to tell us that but that would have to come to another Ministry because the word don't say let arm and nille leave brandom Tabernacle and go to the Fort wind Gospel Tabernacle see they don't say that in the word here see so that's what these gifts are for like a person come up here and say you believe in Divine Healing we preach that we believe it we believe in nor and the all but here some man says he can't get through what's the matter then it takes God through tongues interpretation through prophecy or some way to go down in that man's life and pull out that thing that he's done and tell him about that's a Ministry that doesn't belong to the pastor it belongs to these ministering gifts but they're not to be done out there in the audience see now Paul remember one time had to tell those tell those Ephesian Church anything about that amen and too glad to hear from your lord in such direct ways am praise the name of the Lord I mean God has chosen to address us there is no it's not in a parable form we don't have to learn Greek or we don't have to learn Hebrew or anything it's just simple direct straightforward praise the name of the Lord that is how a husband speaks to the wife and I'm saying the wife not the bride the wife praise the name of the Lord and so that is it I think it's it's very straightforward and that places the responsibility on us right now as what we do with that word that has been given to us hallelujah um you know for most there may be many meetings this night or other nights this uh this week all over the town but at least we can look into the scripture and say that where the carcass is there the Eagles will be guided amen and so when you see yourself here especially you have the Revelation that this is that carcass this is the fresh meat now I don't deny there's meat out there Frozen maybe salted maybe but the fresh the carcass is here praise the name of the Lord and you see you get the best from it when you understand the value of what we are receiving praise the name of the Lord so when the Lord comes in very simple terms nothing nothing complicated no I I feel like it's just a blessing to have a prophet and I don't say this LLY but a prophet who didn't have too much education because that makes it break the thing down in so simple it's not subject to any any any argument at all amen praise the name of the Lord and so when it comes it's our obedience right now that is our stake amen hallelujah and if you realize the word of God always comes with the power to obey now I just want to mention two things that stood out for me I think the first part and I think it's the most important important part is that he says that he waited until they were established in the faith without being established in the faith all these things will be just a routine thing that we're doing without conviction and it's not pleasing to the Lord and a lot of times that is where problem comes right when we have to do something I have to come and stand here what am I going to say let me find the right words let me and then when I'm focused too much on that it doesn't seem sincere again and the Lord is not in it right oh yeah I have to sing well let's see what is on the video and this and the actions they did and okay and then you do that and by the time you finish the sincerity is gone and God is done in it amen and so the first thing is established in the faith and I think that is what the beginning of it that he waited he had all this but he waited and then the next the second thing is when he says that the place is the most spiritual place he being it's very very important that he he points out that he's the most spiritual he doesn't say it's because of the songs they sing he doesn't say it's the biggest place he doesn't say it's because of tongues or anything no he says it's the quality of the spirit the attitude and the solemnness with which they approach the place so if we catch a revelation of what goes on here I think the benefits will be enormous and this is this is it we are the people called to hold this standard yes this a stand that he talks to the extent of saying we should make a reference to it if there is anything we should go back to the T So for sure he knew that this was not just for that church praise the name of the Lord so let's be mindful of this and and let's let's yield ourselves to it there is so much coming from here and I know if we yield ourselves we're going to read benefits that we've not seen yet praise the name of the Lord I'll call the musicians so that me now there is a PRI that says let's take this tape I said let this day be your ultimate on these topics right and so if I bring oh yeah this code says this and the other one says no it says that and this one says this well after all that what does this tape say right because it says let that be your ultimate praise the name of the Lord amen
