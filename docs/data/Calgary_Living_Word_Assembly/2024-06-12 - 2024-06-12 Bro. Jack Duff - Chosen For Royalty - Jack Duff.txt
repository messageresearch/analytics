amen uh at this moment musicians thank you all I appreciate you uh very much I know it is Wednesday night and um you know there's still things to be done probably before we even by the time we get home so I'll do my best to try to uh not take too much of your time time tonight um I bring greetings from Sunny South Florida amen West Palm Beach Florida and uh the weather that you are experiencing right now is what we would call a Florida winter uh but uh but nonetheless we we're grateful uh to be here my wife sister Erica and um our church back home spirit and Truth Tabernacle uh we bring greetings and if you're ever in South Florida on the East Coast uh come by and see us amen we'd love to have you I just want to read a a scripture here from first Peter uh chapter two 1 Peter chapter 2 we'll start at verse one says uh wherefore laying aside all malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings I like reading the scripture and one of the things I like pointing out here is um the scripture says we have to lay these things aside it doesn't say that God has to take them from us but we actually have to give them up right laying aside uh all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sin your milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious says ye also as Lively stones are built built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also uh it it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a CH Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereinto also they were appointed and I'm glad the scripture doesn't stop there the next verse says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we just bow in a word of prayer dear God we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity we have to come and fellowship around the word of the the Lord uh God we ask you blessings upon what we have read but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to make the word live in the day in which we live and father we ask that you would just come now and take control over every thought uh the thoughts that are being presented as well as the thoughts that are being received Lord may you just have the preeminence uh in this portion of the service we thank you that your presence your Mighty presence is already here help us to enter and receive all that you have in store for us tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated uh want to take for a uh subject tonight uh chosen for royalty amen chosen for royalty brother brandom tells us a story um and a couple different sermons and um one sermon I think he says this boy went to his grandmother's house another sermon I think he says he went to his aunt's house and uh and I and I know that there are people out there looking for little things like that in the message to try to find something to say that uh that's why I can't follow the message he doesn't have his stories right uh it's not about whose house the boy went to it's really about what happened when he got to the house and that's the focus that we want to bring our attention to uh tonight brother brandom tells us that this boy was coming from the country and then he walks into this house and I he's there for you know a little bit and just observing all the things there in that house that they don't have out in the country and uh one day this boy finds himself walking up the steps in this house and as he's coming up the steps he gets to the top step and uh when he when he when he looks he uh sees something on the wall that he's never seen before and uh and and you know he just kind of starts making little movements maybe he takes this right hand and he does like this and he sees there this image doing the exact same thing that he's doing then maybe he takes the left hand he does like this and he sees that image doing the exact same thing he's doing and he's he's he's he's in awe of what is going on and finally looks at his mom with a startling amen uh Revelation and it says mama that's me praise the Lord and and I think amen as the bride of Christ hallelujah amen there comes a time where we look into the scripture amen and we can look into the mirror of God's word we say mama that's me hallelujah it's one thing to identify the prophet amen it's another it's one thing to identify all the other you know uh ones that have come on the scene and I mean John the Baptist and he was promised in the scripture we can identify the different ones but when we identify ourselves in the scripture praise God it's a different story amen uh when we talk about this subject of chosen for royalty we we look there at the Scripture it says ye are a chosen generation and uh as I meditated on on on just those words there you know I thought about various Generations that have walked this Earth people that have gone on before us but yet in their time they would have probably thought they were the chosen generation I thought about amen the children of Israel uh certainly would have thought that they were chosen in their day they were uh about 400 years amen waiting to uh come out of bondage and here I mean 10 Generations um uh and and and and this 10th Generation finally had the opportunity to be released from the the bondage of the Egyptians and and I would think that when they come out and they're released from uh years and years of bondage maybe this group would say you know what we are the chosen generation right but uh but when when we look at it you know I said what a generation to live in to see the plague strike Egypt and to see the death angel pass through the land and strike the homes of those who had not followed the words of the Prophet Moses hallelujah amen and and they they experienced the Deliverance departing of the Red Sea death to the Egyptians but but they died wandering in the wilderness rather than enjoying the Bliss of the land flowing with milk and honey that generation failed to enter the promised land but they gave birth to to a new generation Hallelujah after entering the promised land the Next Generation experienced Sons stand still Moon hang over adelon uh they they they they experienced The Parting of the Waters of the Jordan just like their fathers that experienc The Parting of the Red Sea it says and and and after letting out a great shout after walking around the walls of Jericho they saw the walls come down hallelujah what a generation to be living in but and maybe for their day they would consider themselves We Are The Chosen generation hallelujah amen I thought about the the generation that lived during the amen the the the the the time of the first king of Israel Saul uh they saw his rejection by God they saw the uplifting amen of David to become king and and slay Goliath and and eventually become the second king of Israel David was chosen David lived to anoint his son Solomon to be the next king and that generation enjoyed the wisdom of God like no other generation maybe they would have thought we are a chosen generation Hallelujah I think about the generation that lived during the time of the Lord Jesus his first coming my God what a time to live on the earth during the first coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen one would have thought amen that many would have been under expectation to see Christ however there were only a few like Simeon and Anna and and the wise men and some Shepherds that were blessed to welcome him though many experienced his power and his wisdom and when I think about his wisdom I think about the woman caught in adultery and and and and here you know they they they bring this woman into the presence of the Lord Jesus and and they say uh you know we caught her in the act of adultery and we want to know what is it that you suggest that we do what judgment do you think we should bring on to this lady and and the scripture tells us that Jesus just began to write in the sand ignoring every accusation that they were bringing towards this woman I I like this because the the same God that ignored every accusation against her is the same God that ignores every accusation that's brought against us hallelujah he knows that his blood has covered everything amen that the devil can accuse us of Amen so he ignores every accusation and and as as as uh as he's writing there in the sand he finally looks up and he asks these these uh religious leaders that that brought this lady into his presence it says he that's without sin Let Him cast the first stone and and and I love the wisdom of the Lord because if they caught this lady in adultery you can't catch her committing adultery by herself you must bring the other guilty party if you caught her in adultery so I love the way his wisdom just kicked in and handled this situation and when when he says you know woman where are your accusers say I have none he said neither do I accuse you but go and sin no more amen amen hallelujah we thank God for the wisdom that was expressed during the time that Jesus was on the earth we we we we we so many situations the woman at the well the the woman washed his feet and and was she wasn't invited Amen to the party there Simeon but she washed his feed and and had her sins forgiven the feeding of the 5,000 the feeding of the 4,000 Watching The Dead be raised blind giving it sight death uh having their tongues loose and yet the majority of these people wanted to see him crucified what a generation to live in and you know in that generation to be identified with Christ meant to be excommunicated from everything else am what a generation I think of generation that lived to see the soua Street Revival the generation that Liv to see the wealth Revival glory to God some some some wonderful uh people have some wonderful experiences in their time uh here on this Earth and what a mighty move of the spirit of God during the the W Revival and the soua Street Revival those revivals gave birth to another generation that saw people move from tent to 10 and experience the presence of God there were great healing Revival sweeping the Nations right jack Cole or Roberts Billy Graham Tommy Hicks TL Osborne are just some of the Min that were ministers that were used during that time but we also know that uh uh even God's Prophet amen was on the scene during this generation of Mighty temp revivals and many and in brother brandom's day many experienced the presence of Christ amen in his meetings I mean you go to a meeting he he here he's coming from the us and maybe coming here to Alberta and and and calling out names of people and telling their addresses he doesn't even know their address he's never been here before I mean but wherever he went God used the prophet in this way I mean this message that we follow has been thoroughly Vindicated by the Holy Ghost amen it's it's it was not a man it was God in the man it was God in the man and we we and we and like like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ we're following the prophet as he followed Christ I thought about that generation and what a time it would have been to live during the days where you walk into a meeting and and hear the prophet go through you know some of the things that he went through and and just share some of the sermons that he shared and and just to see the supernatural you know just on the scene it would just just bless you to live in a generation like that I I I I know that we still have eyewitnesses amen that are still living and telling us testimonies of things that happen and than that they've seen and the testimonies we enjoy hearing we really do enjoy hearing but I want to just uh I want to make mention of some things some even saw the angel of the Lord some amen experienced a blast that shook the rocks in sunset Mountain Seven Angels come down to commission the prophet while he was in Tucson Arizona and told him to go back east and preach the seals what testimonies we were blessed to hear but I want to say something tonight that generation that lived during the time while the prophet was here on the earth some of them have gone on with the Lord and and some are still living but I want to say that generation was not the climax Oh My My My hallelujah hallelujah God had another generation that was coming along to experience the greatest event that will ever happened on the earth glory to God and what is the greatest event that will ever happened on the Earth Earth it will be the second coming of the Lord amen and only the predestinate will see it and that group that is living during that time is who we call the chosen generation that's right oh my God I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them brother random makes a statement here in the message Ephesians Church H he says the these seven Messengers are making God known to the people he says he that receiveth them receiveth him yes that sent them amen let's just make it really clear if you can't receive the messengers you can't receive Christ glory to God he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them they were seven stars in the hand of the Lord Jesus glory to God they didn't come with their own Ministry they came with his ministry he says this he says John 1320 they speak and act upon his authority he stands behind them with the power of the godhead Matthew 28:18-20 and Jesus came and spake to him all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever whato I have commanded you and lo I'm with you always even until the end of the consummation of the ages it says so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the fire of God holding forth the word of Truth and here he stands to back them upall we we we we recognize it was Christ backing up the prophet and if his Doctrine was wrong why would Christ back him up like that amen no no his Doctrine wasn't wrong that's not the problem it's it's the people that have gone wrong hallelujah amen but here here he says this he says um uh and he stands there stands to back them up and think of it not one believer of any age need cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in the first age when the apostles apostles were first s out there's no need to look back look up Behold Him who is who is uh even now walking in the midst of the churches through Through the Ages through all ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday and today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways whether two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in the midst of them and not only in the midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer Giver of all good gifts to the church hallelujah amen praise the lord we don't need to look back we look up amen amen we thank God for the prior Generations but this this is a very important generation to live in brother Brandon makes a statement in the message Shalom Phoenix Aron Phoenix Arizon says the hour is here if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and look down and seen the whole thing and the father has said to me what day would you want to live Amen brother random said his answer would be I would say now right now you mean in all this Darkness yeah he would choose right now even though there a lot of Darkness there's also a lot of light amen hallelujah I would say now right now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom praise the Lord all right I want to he makes it he goes on says oh the real church of living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the Gospel being Vindicated among them Rise and Shine for the for the light has come to you uh the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day why he had the word manifested and the gospel the bride the Bible a Bible word for day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we're living and I thought about that you know the light of the day we we know with with God vindicating his Prophet took his P the pillar fire took his picture with the prophet multiple times God showing that he was he was he was identified with this ministry but when the prophet left the question is did the pillar fire leave amen when the prophet left did the light leave amen and and and my my answer to you tonight is no the light did not leave well if the light didn't leave where is the light Hallelujah if you don't know the answer I'm going to give it to you right out of scripture Matthew 5:14 and 16 is where we find the answer where is that light the prophet's not here but where is that light where is that pill of fire Hallelujah Jesus said ye are the light of the world glory to God if you looking for the light look within yourself amen amen ye are the light of the world a city that is H set on a hill cannot be here neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven we know where the light is it's in US glory to God Amen brother brandom even told us when we come to church if you would bring your little liquor fire and then this other person bring their little liquor fire and everybody bring their little liquor fire said before you know will'll see the pillar of fire but a little liquor fire is in everybody every Born Again believer hallelujah holy ghost feel Christian amen amen also in John 18:12 it says then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life are we following him the light is inside of us hear the scripture in 1 Peter 2:9 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light and I was just looking at that uh scripture from the emphatic diaglot uh it it reads a little different it says but ye are a chosen race I I like those words ye are chosen race and that means something to us as message Believers I'll read a quote about that in a little bit but you are a chosen race it says a royal priesthood a holy nation then it says this a people for a purpose amen glory that you may declare the Perfections of him who called you from Darkness into his wonderful light I love that I love that see um when when when when when they said that we are chosen race and that that's the original amen uh translation of the uh of the Bible into the English language the emphatic dagot brings us to original translation and and you are a chosen race now that that that that that that connects to something that the angel lord said when he told the prophet pick up your pen and write I I love I love how the Holy Spirit does that and and I'mma tell you in in spoken words The Original Seed you you'll see it where the first time brother brandham releases that but this was not even brother bram's words he was simply the Scribe that was writing down what the angel said and the Ang was speaking that to a generation that was to come he was speaking it to you he speaking it to me and the angel said in the Ephesian Church AG it says in the LA in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him brother is thus sayith the Lord I don't care how we feel I don't care you know how the devil might make us uh make it seem like we're not uh conquerors or not Victorious here the the the prophet tells us by an Angel an angel says amen that as we say we will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very [Music] [Applause] image hey we're being changed right now every time we come into the house of the Lord we're being transformed and changed into His Image it's not based on how we feel Saints it's based on what is what is thus sayith the Lord sir and all we do is yield ourselves to what the word of God says we act we we act just like Mary be it unto me according to Thy Word a yielded vessel yes Peter writes this but you are chosen generation the Royal priest of the holy nation peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light it's Peter that writes this and as I was just doing a little research I found out that this was written in ad. 60 60 years after the death of our death and resurrection of our Lord and savior 60 years pet would write first Peter here and and and and and you know for me as I'm sitting there and I'm looking at that and I'm going through the life of Peter so why would Peter write ye are our chosen generation if I was Peter and I was doing right in this I don't think I would have put ye I think I would have put I I am a chosen generation and I think Peter his resume amen uh there's enough things in resume where he could say that and we probably all agree but he doesn't say I he says ye oh my think about some of the things that Peter went through the the very first time he meets the Lord Jesus Peter is is is is is coming in from work his his his Fe his his um uh uh his profession is fishing and Peter's coming in from work and brother brandham gives us a little insight Amen to what was going on Peter amen docks his boat and he gets out the boat he's a little discouraged because they haven't caught any fish amen and and he and he and and and it just so happened where he docks the boat amen Jesus decides to have a service in that spot that that day so so so brother Ram said that when Peter got out of the boat he come up on the shore and he maybe sat down on a stump and he says let's see what this fella has got to say Amen sometimes we come to church with the same type of approach let's see what this fell has got to say hallelujah glory to God so Peter approaches amen the service with this type of uh amen uh attitude if I could put it that way but but as he's sitting there the crowds get larger and larger and uh and brother brandom tells us amen that that Jesus looks to P said could I could I get into your boat and preach from your boat to these people so so Peter said well sure you know I mean the people are pushing you back into the water why don't you step up here in my boat and and and just go ahead and finish out your sermon Jesus finishes the sermon maybe closes in prayer and says amen and and then he tells Peter launch out into the deep and I can imagine Peter start having a conversation with say now look it was a really good sermon and I enjoyed the words that you had to say but I've been out into the deep and there were no fish out there and I'm a fisherman I know when the tide moves a certain way we can get fish but right now there would be no fish so there's no need for us to go out into the deep amen and I can see him having his conversation with the Lord Jesus and then he finally realizes that you know what let me just yield to what he's saying so so so so so Peter says nevertheless at Thy word I'll launch out into the deep Hallelujah we need to stop wrestling with God Amen Let's Take God at his word nevertheless at Thy word I launch out into the [Applause] deep they launch out into the deep and then Jesus said why don't you just drop your net on this side and when he said nah all right I'm out here I might as well just drop the net on that side throws the net out and and when they went to pull the net in it almost brought the boat down it pays to be obedient that was his first encounter with the Lord Peter was a man that saw his mother-in-law healed in the very uh hour that Jesus prayed for Peter was a man that that did something that only the Lord Jesus did and I like this you know because uh Jesus that told the disciples go on over to the other side I I now don't know how Jesus going to get to the other side they're in a boat and they're headed to the other side but how's he going to come and before you know it here comes Jesus and I and here's the thing that I want you to get sometimes we miss this in scripture Jesus did not come walking on the water while it was calm it was it was a boisterous wind it was a it was a storm happening at the time and here Jesus comes walking on the water as if the storm had could not do anything to him my God but here's here's the beauty of it it wasn't Peter walking on the water without a storm it was Peter walking on the water in a storm at the most difficult time this is when Peter walks on the water he's the only man that shares that experience with the Lord Jesus he says if it Be You Lord if it really be you then bid me to come to you and and I like it cuz Jesus did not give Peter a quote Jesus did not give him a scripture Jesus gave him one word he gave him come you want to hear me say come then you going to have to take a step of faith and you're going to have to come and here comes Peter out the boat I can see him taking his time like one foot out and one foot in and just making sure that the water is going to hold him up and he I mean he's probably getting wet and everything like I don't I can't believe what I'm doing right now but he takes a step of faith and begins to walk on that water right to Jesus the only reason he sunk is because he took his eyes off the Lord Jesus and even when he cried Lord help me and God and Jesus was right there to save him I don't believe that Jesus picked Peter up put him on their shoulders and carried him back to the boat right I believe Jesus said now if you walked out here you can walk back Keep On Walking Peter and keep your eyes on me Hallelujah if I would have experienced that I'm talking about me if it was me walking on water and I can claim amen now I'm the only man that's ever done the same thing the Lord Jesus did in this I'm going to write I'm the chosen generation that's right yeah y the same Peter that walked on water and caught all these fish and saw his mother-in-law healed and saw some Miracles and he was there feeding the 5,000 4,000 I mean Peter was there he he did he did it all but the same Peter was told that before the crows you'll deny me three times before it throw it crows twice you'll deny me three times and people oh not me but just exactly what Jesus said happened to Peter and you can imagine the same man that walked on water same man that saw his mother uh mother mother-in-law heel the same man that that that caught all these fish is the same man that got so discouraged that he He Turned and wanted to walk away from the Lord wanted to walk away from everything that he experienced but when Jesus rose again Jesus said something very specific he says go tell my disciples and I love it and Peter go tell my disciples and Peter because he knew what Peter was going through he knew where his mindset was he knew how defeated he might have felt but go tell my disciples and Peter I'm going to meet him in Galilee I like to say it like this I don't care how much Peter fail and I don't care how much you fail your failures cannot disqualify you from sunship Hallelujah I want to say that again your failures cannot disqualify you from son shipl Peter was commanded to feed the sheep and feed the Lambs he was part of a generation that experienced the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost but Peter writes ye are a chosen generation and I I want you to understand why Peter writes that it's because Peter Not only was he there experiencing the first coming of the Lord Jesus but Peter got a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord amen and the greatest event that will ever happen on the face of the Earth is the second coming of the Lord sir and and and and and and don't get me wrong I I I do believe in the broad coming of Christ and I believe in the word coming I believe in all of that but at the first coming of the Lord it was a literal person and we're looking for that literal person to come again praise the Lord amen here um uh Peter I want to just uh make mention that he um he was there and got a glimpse of the second coming as well as the you know he he he heard this from the Lord Jesus he also heard heard it from the angel of the Lord Matthew 17: 10-13 is what I want to refer to really quick this to me is a a very important scripture especially for uh this time in which we live um here the second coming of the Lord there's going to be a great Fallen away and uh we're seeing that right in our ranks there there are people falling away but as some are Falling Away God is restoring others so we don't keep our our attention on the ones that's falling away and and and and I'll be the first one to admit I'm going to say this amen I don't believe everybody that has fallen away are going to be lost amen I believe some of them are going to be restored I believe I believe the scripture says that they they really they're they're just they they've aired in spirit right but God say he'll bring them to an understanding so I trust that God will do that amen it says it in the book of Isaiah I believe they a those that air in spirit will be brought to an understanding so don't put everybody out don't put them all down just pray for the people amen but Matthew 17 uh this is um their on Mount transash figer and um and and you know after this great experience of s Moses and Elijah verse 10 says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and look at this and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things then he goes on to say but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer at them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist amen now um when when when when we look at that scripture you know we have to ask well which coming of Elias did the disciples understand was John the Baptist because I believe the one the coming that Jesus was talking about was when he said but I say unto you say unto you Elias has come already that's the Elias that they understood that it was John the Baptist but when Jesus said Elias shall truly first come and restore all things that was a different coming of Elijah if I can just be bold enough to say Jesus himself prophesied of brother Brandon's Ministry Jesus spoke of it so I asked the young man one time he you know he he he he wanted to straighten me up on the scripture because he was leaving the message you know and he wanted to prove this scripture it says you know even the Bible says they understood it was John the Baptist I said okay well you got an answer to who this the Jesus said elishah truly first come and restore all things you got an answer you think that's John the Baptist I think it's William Brandon but you think it's John the Baptist I said that's fine I said okay at least you got an answer cuz there's many people in denomination world would not even have an answer for that right I said but at least you got an answer I just think your answer is wrong but but it's okay you got an answer I said but now since you have an answer and you said and Jesus said that Elijah was going to come and restore all things then you have to tell me what did John the Baptist restore if John the Baptist is your answer you have to share with me what did he restore and here's the other thing you cannot tell me John the Baptist restore one thing because Jesus said that he was going to restore all things so the brother told me he says well I haven't studied that one I said okay I got it nothing no need to study it because John the Baptist didn't restore anything not even his baptism lasted beyond the book of Acts so this has got to be speaking of somebody else and then even in the book of Acts it says to the restitution of all things this is after John the Baptist ministry so this is another Elias that's supposed to come right this is the ministry of William Mari and brandom well I asked you the question what did John the Baptist restor and you have no answer well you should ask me the same question if I say that brother Brandon was the one that restore all things according to what Jesus said then you need to have that question what did he restore I got a couple answers for you the mystery of water baptism that was restored what really happened in the garden of [Music] the original sin that truth was restored the serpent seed that was restored the godhead Jehova of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new that truth was restored the truth of marriage and divorce the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation no eternal hell the mystery of the Rapture the shout The Voice the Trump and we're in it right right now these things were restored by our [Applause] prophet he fulfilled exactly what Jesus said elijas would become would come and restore all [Applause] things and and there's so many more out there John the Baptist touched none of that joh he never preached any of these things but we know brother brandham did that's how we know that he is that the messenger oh my God as as John foran my first coming your message will forerun my second coming we know that's nothing but William Mary and Brandon and we're not saying that to worship him we say that to worship God it's just that we recognize how God has done things in this hour there's an order they had to recognize John in their day to get be prepared for the first coming we going have to recognize that Elijah for this day in order to be ready for the second coming Peter was there when these words were spoken Peter also was there in Acts 1: 8-11 says but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the Earth and when he had spoken these things while while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud a cloud received him out of their sight a cloud did it it just kind of ironic that there's a cloud coming 1963 that actually formed the face of Christ with seven angels right and and and and and and and when science had no idea what it was oh my they they got it printed in in in in Life magazine and and and and they just they're just oh this mysterious Cloud mysterious Cloud but a prophet oh my a prophet comes to the church he does not go to the television station or to the radio station he doesn't go to any he goes to church and he reveals a secret to the people he says if you want to know what it is is they don't need to know but if you would just turn the picture to the right you'll see it's Christ it's Christ well look at what the what here here here's what the angel told Peter here in Acts one he says and when he had spoken these things which while they beheld and he was taken up and a clout received him out of his sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also say ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into to Heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come and like man as you have seen him go into heaven Peter gets a gets a glimpse of the second coming of the Lord and some events that will take place at the second coming of the Lord and because of what Peter sees Peter writes ye amen woo because of what Peter sees Peter writes ye are a chosen generation that generation that's living during the time of the second coming of the Lord Jesus that generation is chosen hallu chosen for royalty brother brandom he uh uh makes a a statement here in the message the pma's vision excuse me one second um patma Vision he says this now notice before Jesus returns to earth now this is a little ahead of time but the spirit of Elijah will return back to the Earth and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers I I just love that I love that the spirit of Elijah will return to Earth and is gonna do one thing turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers that mean our hearts go back to the word anybody anybody that tells you that you well I'm going have to leave the message and go back to the word oh my I don't know if you understood what you were following in the first place right the message is the word amen the the very the very purpose of the Prophet was to turn our hearts back to the word amen my how how can you miss it right I mean you you and and and as I read earlier if you if you reject one the messenger you rejecting Christ that's right amen it's just that simple this is how Christ did it this is this is how he operates amen look at what he says this it says the spirit of will return back to Earth and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers the Bible said so Jesus saw him here the apostles saw him here the order of the coming of the son of man glorified he's be glorified and coming back the first thing before they saw him was what Elijah then what Moses Israel return y the lawkeepers and the glorified son of man Hallelujah do you see the order of his coming the spirit of Elijah or it or or the witness of the last Church age see coming in power to manifest him we talk about chosen for royalty and my mind and my heart goes back to one in the scripture certainly chosen for royalty but when he was uh chosen no one in his household believed that there was any royalty about him at all none whatsoever right a prophet has been told by God that Saul has been rejected is King and I got myself another king and you're going to find him in the house of Jesse and I want you to take your your oil and go down and anoint this next king God doesn't tell him when he's going to become king he just says he's the next king and I just need you to be obedient go down and anoint this this this this one of Jesse's Sons to be king now here's my thing if God could tell him what house to go to couldn't God also tell him which boy it was going to be right but God didn't do it that way he even the prophet has to walk by faith amen right so here he goes down there Amen to Jesse's house and and when he tells Jesse why he's there Jesse says oh my uh a king is coming out of my house oh Prophet look at this son right here the firstborn look at this boy I know he's the one come on pull your oil out on him and brings them before the prophet no oil the prophet looks say well even the prophet was so excited said this has got to be him he looks almost like Saul and God has a Tong say no no no no no no no don't look on the outward appearance I look at the heart I look at the heart not the outward appear but I look at the heart amen says okay well you next son number two number three number four and no oil no oil no oil I think they get all the way to seven no oil and do you realize that it was the prophet that had to suggest to the father now now isn't that something Daddy has has paraded all the boys before the prophet almost all of them and the prophet has to say do you have yeah that's right the prophet has to ask the question do you have any other sons and I can imagine maybe Jesse saying look now I know God told you to go to Jesse's house but there is another Jessie down the street and he does have some Sons it's it's possible that you got the wrong house because if none of these boys got any oil I can guarantee that the last boy that I go get there would be no oil on that boy we won't eat until you go get [Applause] them we're not going to eat till you go get them you go get them and I can see his brother go out to the field and David's there and doing his job watching over the sheep and and here comes one of his brothers and say daddy said come home he says come home no I'm watching the sheep and you know it's a it's a it's a shame for a Shepherd to lose sheep so I'm not going to leave these sheep he says boy just come home daddy wants you home now well why what's the hurry what's the rush why I'm out here taking care of the sheep why why am I Rush look the prophet said that God told him to come to Daddy's house and the next king was going to be in our house now all of your brothers have gone before this prophet and no oil has come out on anybody but daddy said to appease the prophet he wants you to come home okay and by the time David gets to the door I I can imagine that little oil container just started and everybody in the house was Witnesses of what was going on with that oil and they knew all of them coming nothing happened with that oil but all of a sudden David comes and the oil is just just my God like an eruption about to happen and and the prophet looks like this is the boy yeah this is the boy pour the oil down right on him everybody knew David had been chosen for [Music] royalty hallu the anointing sits on us as the bride of Christ we've been chosen just like David was chosen the blood of Jesus Christ puts us in a certain position tonight it's not based on how we feel it's not based on our mistakes it's not based on our failures it's based on what God has already done and here's the beautiful thing I like about David you know when David went out to fight Goliath David was the only man in the Kingdom of Israel that could fight Goliath and not die had David died on the battlefield fighting Goliath God would have had to raise him back up because he was already [Applause] pre-anoxic had ordained for him to come and if nothing can stop David I'm here to tell you nothing can stop you my brother my sister nothing everything the devil threw at you could not stop you until you come into the place that God has for you Ephesians 1:4 through 7 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches amen of his grace hallelujah oh this is all him it's not nothing to do with us but it's all him amen we thank God for this hallelujah hallelujah let me uh slip down here in my notes this um we said chosen for royalty because Peter writes but ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light and what royalty or Royal means to be kingly royal means to be kingly or belonging to a King as his children yes Royal means to be kingly or belonging to a King as his children and I have you to know tonight we fit both definitions hallelujah amen amen both definitions pertain to us amen we are kingly amen and we also Belong To The King as his children amen hallelujah let me just read just something here oh my my my brother Brandon makes a statement and I want to pick this up in Revelation 1 Revelation 1 15 and 6 and from Jesus Christ who is the faith witness the first begotten of the Dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and the next verse and hath made us Kings Hallelujah and Priests unto God Amen and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Amen brother random makes reference to this scripture as he's explained it in the church age book um it says he hath made us he says oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize amen it says this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose see a people for a purpose he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and I I like when he says that you know the scripture says that we're we're we're we we're Kings we're we're Kings he has made us Kings and and sisters I know sometimes that might be a little hard for the Sisters just walk into that because it's a masculine term but but but understand sisters we are brothers and we have to walk into a feminine term and we have no problem accepting it we are the bride of Christ amen it's a feminine term but that's who we are so so when the scripture tells you that you are King don't don't don't minimize and say queen no you are a king his blood made you king oh my my my brother random goes on to say this in the church a book he says uh uh and and in Colossians 113 who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son and I love this statement right here it says right now we reign with Christ and this is just one of those quotes that I don't like to read by myself I like to have the church just repeat after me because this is something that you need to it's a it's a affirmation this is an affirmation so I want you to repeat after me say right now right now we Reign we re with Christ with Christ having Dominion having dominion over sin over sin the world the World the Flesh the and the devil and the devil hallelujah we're not waiting to get the victory we got it right now whether we feel like it or not we still got the victory we Reign Over the devil we Reign Over Our flesh we Reign Over The World We Reign Over sin Amen brother random says sh forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for Christ for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we're seated in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praises of Sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and Kings unto our God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father a couple other scriptures to solidify our place as kings Revelations 5:9 and 10 says and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred in tongues and people and nation and as made us as made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Revelation 17:14 says this the shall make war with the lamb and the lamb Shall Overcome come them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings if he's King of Kings who is who are these other kings that he's king of I think I see some of them here in Alberta tonight amen he's King of Kings Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen Hallelujah and faithful amen since we know that you are a king the scripture proves it the prophet has said it this is the place that God has called us to this is the place that the blood has brought us to I want to just mention these things as I bring my thought to a close tonight the conduct of a king even though a king is a a great man or great woman they make others feel greater am cuz Jesus the Creator he was the one that washed the the feet of the disciples him being king of kings and Lord of lords he still made them feel Greater by him taking the towel and ging himself and washing their feet other thing about a king is that he or she they look good even when they feel feel bad brother brandom told us about the king of England that passed through the land of Canada and how he was man he was so sick but he could not get into that Chariot and allow the people to see how ill he was so even when he felt ill he felt really bad somehow he still brought himself into that when he got into that Chariot he made himself look look like he was well and I want to tell you something you know um in the book of Nehemiah it was they could not come before the king with a sad countenance that's right so before you walk through the doors of the church I don't care what you've gone through somehow you got to shift your attitude cuz I cannot come into the presence of Kings with a sad countenance you got to look good even when you're feeling bad a King is the final Authority they sought to kill Jesus and they sought to kill Moses because of the king's edict in the days of Daniel he was not allowed to pray because the king had signed a decree saying that no one could pray out uh uh unless they were praying to Darius they couldn't pray to anybody else for 30 days and and and and the King was all he Oh my he was just so happy to to put this thing in writing and and then he forgot oh I got a friend of mine that I know will not obey this law and and and and and all the counselors they they went and after the king signed they went immediately to Daniel's house that's right we got the paperwork signed by the king now let's see what he's going to do and and Daniel here's what Daniel does he opens the windows brother he doesn't close I want you to see who I'm praying to and he gets down on his knees and he has the same prayer that he all we caught him we caught him we caught him we got him we'll take him right here to the king and when they get down to the king king you sign this EDI and you know um we caught Daniel praying to his God and you know your edict says if anybody get caught they got to get thrown into the lion's den and the King said oh no I can't believe I did this to Daniel but they told him said King remember that once a king signs it it's final and I want you to know that God has signed whatever promise that he's put in the scripture and it is final it cannot be changed it cannot be erased it cannot be removed what God spoke it must come to pass because the King has signed it in blood Darius went through the night fasting and praying for for Daniel and and my God delivered Daniel down there in that Lion's Den and Darius was the first one to meet him as the sun was Rising I don't know if it was like the sun here cuz sun go down at at like midnight and then come up at 5:00 in the morning if if Daniel had one of them Sons he didn't have to stay there that long but uh but but nonetheless here Darius gets down there says uh did your God deliver you say oh yeah don't worry God delivered me and put these Lions to sleep he couldn't believe God had done that for for his for for his buddy but he he realized that what he signed it was it was in writing another king uh that put something writing and and and um um just through his words oh hmon couldn't sleep one night and he says you know what I'm going to go in here and see the king because I'm kind of tired of this guy Mori I I I I I need something to be done about Mori here he comes into the king's chamber and and says who's that that's hymon oh hmon before you have a word let me say something okay says what would you do Hyman for someone that's done something for the king but they never got acknowledged what would you do well um if it were me um I would get the king's horse as nice as horse and I get the some really nice apparel and then I have a man you know one of one of the greatest men in in the Kingdom go before this man and and say this is how the king honors those that honors The King and I just have them walking through the city saying that and and that's what I would do cuz you know who else would be worthy of this honor than me he says I like that idea do that for Mory Amen brother you know I mean when the scripture says he knows how to make your enemies your foot stol Mori was not even expecting that but here comes hmon walking him through the city just this is how the king honors those that honor him I mean it's embarrassing but when the king spoke it there was nothing that anybody could do to stop it from coming to pass oh my my my my my my another thing about a king he keeps his head up in dire situations brother brandom tells us about this this this young man that came from Africa it was in the states right not on his own accord brought there to be a slave but when he came there even though
