Father Lord Jesus this morning we thank you Father for this opportunity to gather together your provided way Lord amen and knowing we can look at the mechanical things and we can say that we've got a building and music and everybody knows what time to show up but father we know that provided place is none of those that provided place is in you and we're so thankful for that little tiny space Lord that you have provided in this world of Darkness Lord for your kingdom to be and Lord Jesus every single one of the elect seat that you called before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus we find ourselves there and father we have a desire to find that last predestinated one father that we know things will change father this morning we have needs in our midst Lord father some acknowledged and some Maybe not maybe we haven't even recognized in our own lives father we pray that you would meet every single need according to your riches in glory father we pray that Lord Jesus as we endure the trials in our lives father that we would Lord look to you and thank you Father for your goodness in our lives Lord that we wouldn't lament and say why but that we would know that you have given it to us so that we can overcome father we pray for those requests Lord that were made known unto you by way of an uplift hand that you would sovereignly meet the needs Lord father we pray for those who are sick amongst us Lord Jesus that you would raise them up amen Lord that they would know you as their healer amen father we're so thankful that you have many attributes that you desire to express and we know there's only one way that you can do that and that's to have subjects to express yourself to and through father this morning we pray that Lord we could just step into another realm father that we could see Heaven and Earth meet once again that Lord when we leave this place today we would say truly that our hearts burned within us because you spoke to us along the way and father when we recognize your voice when we no longer hear Brother Barry speaking that we could say oh Father help me Lord change my heart let me change my heart let me put myself on that on that potter's wheel and be molded and shaped Lord and not have the starchy attitude that I know it and I've already been shaped and that's as good as it's going to get father help us to desire Lord to be broken and and put back together the way that you want us to be father Lord Jesus we can never make it without you we just ask that you would sovereignly move in our hearts today Father and we'll be careful to give you

sister Emily hereen family with us from uh Washington amen we have brother Ethan here from Edmonton God bless you brother good to see you I thought you would be skiing today but something in the heart of a brother that just desires to be in the service on a Sunday we have brother qua and brother Miguel here brother qua is a good friend of mine from years ago and uh he was here with brother Andrew Glover God richly bless you both trust you enjoy your time here and uh last but certainly not least we have brother Fifi Odin oo and family we're certainly happy to have you in our midst God richly bless you we'll certainly shake your hand afterwards we uh maybe just turn with me in your Bibles to 2 chonicles 2 chonicles actually no I'm getting ahead of myself Philippians chapter 2 Philippians chapter 2 and then second 2 Chronicles Philippians chapter 2 we'll start with verse one if there be any therefore if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind I just think that's so good it it just it's so clear isn't it let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves now that's a tough one even amongst Believers look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you amen which was also in Christ Jesus let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we know that it's Eternal we know that all heavens and all Earth will pass away but your word is the only thing that will remain and father Lord we just ask that your mind would be in us and we know there's only one way for that to happen and that's by your spirit so father we pray that we could push back any spirit that would be contrary to yours in the name of Jesus Christ and just claim this time for you that Lord your mind would be in us that we would be in one mind and one Accord as we go forwards that you would just minister to us sovereignly according to your word we love you and we thank you we just Commit This service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated this morning just uh just uh bear with me for a second couple birthdays we wanted to mention brother Mila kikuji sister jarmaine mangusi ngoy and uh she's the mother of brother Mila kikuji they're both actually January 1 birthdays and uh sister Priscilla kabanda is on the 4th so God bless you all and Happy Birthday to you just a few announcements we have no service on the 1st which is Wednesday but we do have a service on the 31st we'll have a communion foot Washing Service and testimonies and specials if you have specials we certainly want to make room for them um so that will be on the 31st as the world celebrates and brings in the new year with all of their uh ways we're going to do it our way and and uh we trust that it will just be a blessing for anyone who can attend are you happy this morning amen we have uh just a note I wanted to mention I got a an email uh a week ago from a brother named Emmanuel lob beima and he and his family are intending to move to Calgary Lord willing from Cameroon so if you can pray for brother Emmanuel and his family I spoke to I think it was his Pastor brother Lauren Aang um but I don't understand the connection because he said he's a pastor in Maryland in the US maybe he was his former Pastor in Cameroon I'm not quite sure but we certainly look forward to getting to know them and uh we trust the Lord will open the doors that need to be opened it certainly isn't easy to immigrate and uh so as uh as things unfold we'll certainly keep you posted God bless you we uh just wanted to continue on our discussion from the last time we spoke um which has been a while on the importance of Revelation and how as Christians as Believers there's no way that we're ever going to see what we need to see without Revelation from God because we can take the book The Bible and read it and it will be text and and and chapter and book and it will just become knowledge to us without Revelation in our lives and we know that Revelation only comes one way God bless you Brother Sam it's good to see you it only comes Revelation only comes the right Revelation only comes by the spirit and that spirit that we're talking about is Christ and it's real important to recognize that there are spirits at play that's that's right and there's good spirits and there's bad spirits how many were fed last Sunday with Brother John bringing his message we have a Graphic that we uh certainly can share with the church that brother John was using and you know we we are kind of caught in the middle according to that graphic aren't we we're we're we're caught in in in in the regions of the natural where where human beings exist but there's Spirits in heaven and their Spirits in hell and they all have the ability to influence us that's right sometimes if God desires they can actually manipulate the natural circumstances for us or against against us it's up to God there's nothing that happens outside of God being sovereignly involved with it and I think it's so incredibly important to just maybe once in a while remember how important it is that God is in control because if God is not in control 100% then he's not God it's not God maybe 95% power today and and maybe 99% power tomorrow and and you know last week something bad happened and it was just only 65% battery strength with God that's not how he operates God is Sovereign over the universe he created the heavens and the Earth he knows everything inside and out upside and down I think it's so beautiful how we can know by Revelation when we hear things sometimes they become a little bit more real to us we know that we had a prophet in our age a Vindicated Prophet I might add and that prophet he brought the the idea for us to recognize he even said it that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our voices are here on Earth my goodness God is in control he's keeping track of every single thing that's happening in our lives amen one of the things that I I just think is so important to even maybe outline and highlight just a little bit one of the things that the children of Israel did that really it was the only thing that the children of Israel did that really upset God and that was murmuring amen when people began to murmur after he delivered them from the bondage of Egypt they got out in the desert and said you know it would have been better for us if we would have just gone back to Egypt let's go back to the bondage that we were in at least we knew we could satisfy this natural flesh what a place that would be to live right but you know God was listening amen they thought they were slandering Moses amen this guy this Wild guy that took us out here so that we could die of starvation and die of maybe the misery of no water to drink but they weren't slamming Moses they were slamming God am right yes they were he's the same yesterday today and forever amen if we think that we could get away with murmuring here on this Earth it ain't going to happen God will not allow it to happen that's the God we serve I think it's so beautiful today he says in this scripture that we read let this mind be in you what mind is that so I wanted to take a little bit of a look at it and just you know under the the the the idea of the importance of Revelation recognizing that it takes Revelation to really understand maybe what I'm I'm harping about here but talking about the children of Israel coming out of bondage they they had severe bondage we we know that we have heard it said that if the Taskmaster desired to just take a man's wife and beat her he could do that and there was nothing the husband could do if he wanted to take a child of that family and do whatever he wanted to he could do it no problem and all the family could do was just watch and maybe cry out we know that it was the cries of the children of Israel that that God said you know I I've I've heard their cry and I've come down to visit them and to deliver them but how did he do it he didn't do it according to the banisters of Heaven opening up and the the escalator golden escalator turning on and all the angels and God and His holy procession coming down what did he do he lit a bush on fire and captured the attention of a man amen he used a man to come down and actually deliver the people amen it's no different today he uses men amen amen and when we murmur against those men we're not murmuring against those men Ain a it ain't what's happening we're murmuring against God Amen who would want to do that in the right mind and you know brothers and sisters I'll tell you what I'm going to be the first one to say guilty guilty you ever murmur about a man you ever murmur about someone else we're not murmuring about that person we're murmuring about God we need to remember that and we need to repent for it it we know that uh there was a man in the Bible he actually was a bad man but what happened was God brought correction to his life and what did he do he walked softly and God said well I'm actually I can see that he has repented but he's already sinned so now the Judgment isn't going to fall in his generation it'll just come upon his children and you know sometimes in our lives I feel like that could be what happens we live good lives and and and we see good lives we see abundance in our Liv and everything is fine but what happens is God's judgment doesn't fall in our lives he visits us on the second and third generation doesn't he amen we need to be careful yes but talking about the uh the scripture today let this mind be in you I think it's beautiful if they in Philippians 2 verse1 if they're be therefore any consolation in Christ if if we can have any peace of mind if we can have any any Assurance to know that that we have something that's going to look after us if if we have any of that in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit any bowels of mercies he says fulfill ye my joy Paul speaking to the Philippians and every other age here not just the Philippians that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind there's only one way that's going to happen and that's through having Having the Holy Spirit in your life now I know some people don't like hearing about that but remember we're in a one room Schoolhouse there's some veteran Elders of the message and there's some Junior kindergarteners in our midst and that's the way it is that's God's choice that's how he does it I can't help but think how the the the pattern I would say was set you have a prophet a Vindicated Prophet that would ask a woman who is in her 80s or 90s sister how long has it been since you got the holy ghost in your life and and she says she doesn't get mad and say why do you keep harping about the Holy Ghost what you don't you think I got it what do I got in my life why would you do that no she says praise God I remember exactly when I got it I might not have felt it like a lightning bolt but I know something happen in my life I started to love my brother and my sister I started to examine things in my life I started to see the word differently I heard the message in a different way something happened in my life that's what the Holy Ghost does without the Holy Ghost we can talk about these words here and they won't mean anything like we heard last Sunday we'll have head knowledge we be educated who wants to be a scholar of the word and not a doer of the word that's right I think it's very important for us to recognize we've been given an instruction here and and all of us need to be of one mind and one Accord and let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory I'm probably going to examine these words but not today strife and vain Glory we can we can be looking for some accolades some folks want that don't they they they want a pat on the back they want to see their name on the website they want to see their name in print they want a business card some people want that but that's not what he's talking about here we're not we're not looking to see vain Glory but loneliness of mind let us esteem what what are we supposed to esteem others better than themselves my and look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others just makes me think of the story we know we hear it about all all the time I can't get away from it there was two in the Garden of Eden weren't there they're actually kicked out of the Garden of Eden but there was two real close to it that heard the stories of what it was like to live in the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel and they both went to church and they both worshiped and we know that when the correction was brought the the action by the one demonstrated whose father was his whose son he really was and we know that one his he's not in the lineage of of Adam it's not written in the Bible he he the Bible even says that he's of his father the evil one but we're not going to get into that today but what I wanted to say was when the correction came his reaction to the correction demonstrated who he was yes and we know that the word of God says it very clearly that if we don't receive correction by the word then that shows that we're bastards that were not even his children amen a and when the spirit of God comes around and brings us correction Where Do We Stand today because he's Hebrews 138 isn't he isn't he the same yesterday today forever fully in control of every single situation that happens it's not just brother so and so chirping someone just preaching or maybe it is but you know I I just think it's wonderful for us to be able to look at this scripture and even if we can say when we look at a scripture like this and say you know I I I just struggle I just struggle doing things for others I just always want to be at the front of the line at the potluck I just always want to be highly esteemed when I come to church I always want to be the the the one whose name is mentioned at work I always want to be the one who's who's first in everything because I'm just so competitive but I still have a desire when I read this word something inside me says but that's what I want to be even though that's how I feel in this flesh I hate it but I want to be like that I want to say to you today there's hope amen there's hope for us cuz I know I read this and I think man I I know I've done stuff I have not esteemed others greater than me I know it I know it I know it but when I read it I think my I want to be like that I want to have that mind I want to strive to actually esteem others greater than me but what I want to get to today is let this mind be in you verse five which was also in Christ Jesus it gives us an exact pattern not just something kind of close not just something kind of wavery that maybe we would see in a in an Apostle's life we know that all the apostles were chosen very specifically for very specific reasons and we know that the one that that that many people refer to even in the Catholic church to say that you know the that Jesus told him Flesh and Blood didn't reveal it to you Peter when he asked him the story he said who who's everyone saying that I the son of manam and some said Elias and some said the prophets Jeremiah Etc and he said but who do you say and we know that by Revelation he was able to say thou art the Christ which means the sent one the deliverer the son of the Living God and Jesus God and flesh told him right there that was not from you no man taught you that your parents didn't teach you that no preacher taught you that that I didn't teach you that that came from the father above amen that was Revelation the importance of that Revelation letting this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus it brings the characteristics of Jesus it doesn't bring waffle characteristics where we can say today I can act like this and tomorrow I'll act the other way no no no it causes us to act a very specific way but we have been given the ability to do that it's not something that we need to try and strive for we can worry about maybe not getting there we will get there and and I would say that most of us are there many times I'll tell you I don't feel like I'm there does anybody feel like they've arrived you're ready for the body change I'm not alone then God help because our feelings brothers and sisters have nothing to do with it remember that's what the prophet of God said our feelings have nothing to do with it the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is without sensation but what happens is we line up with the word of God and what a what a wonderful thing it is to think that we have an absolute there is an absolute it's not a a a measuring tape with 14 different versions of measuring scales it's one measuring scale the word of God Amen talking about Revelation and uh and how important it is for us to have revelation we cannot enter into a body change without a revelation brother Bram said the Rapture is is a revelation we we can't actually have faith in the word of God without a revelation we have got to have a revelation we can't have faith that we can be saved unto salvation without a revelation in our lives Revelation is the critical Factor that's God himself revealing himself to us through his word I I just can't get away from uh the thought in 2 Chronicles if you want to turn over uh over there with Me 2 Chronicles chap 18 we're going to take a little story today and uh I trust it's okay amen we've preached it from First Kings chapter 22 the story of the Prophet Micaiah I I think that we're all very familiar with it maybe there's some that aren't but you know I just felt led to go here so we know enough to do that in uh 2 chronic chapter 18 we'll probably read a fair bit today but I think it's important and what better thing to read than the word of God Amen first uh 2 Chronicles 18 verse1 says now josephat had riches and honor in abundance and joined Affinity with Ahab and after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramoth Gilead and Ahab king of Israel said unto josephat king of Judah wil thou go with me to ramoth Gilead and he answered him I am as Thou Art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war and we know that ramoth Gilead was being inhabited it was actually being squatted on the enemy had taken it and made it their own and Ahab who wasn't really living according to the the measure of the word in his day he thought you know we should go after this land because it's ours and Ahab we know that he he he really misbehaved Ahab was a backslidden Christian am that's what brother Bram said he was a backslider and and in his condition he decided that he wanted to go and do something righteous and we know that wasn't the right thing to do but we know that it was all for a purpose Naturally Speaking we can look at it and say if he didn't do that perhaps he wouldn't have actually died but we know there was a prophecy for him because of what he did he he he he didn't walk softly before the Lord for a long time and and even to the place where a grown man went to take he went down to take naboth's Vineyard and naboth told him to get lost this is my inheritance you cannot have it I don't care if you're the king you can't have my inheritance and what happened was Ahab went home and pouted he went and laid up on the bed and pouted he wouldn't eat he threw a little fit grown man the king and it took his wife to come in and say what's up with you what's your problem man why aren't you busy leading our family like you should instead you're giving me the chore of actually being the one with the backbone when you're the one that ought to have it here let me figure this out what did she do she made a decree she said take these pass them out to all the people we're going to take naboth we're going to set him on high before the children of Israel he is a secret Sinner and we need to deal with them so I want you to take them out and stone them she didn't tell everyone what the what the final score was going to be but this guy he actually really messed up in his life a and he really got to the place where God said you know I just can't deal with this anymore it's just not going to carry on like this and there was a prophecy that came forward there's a word that came and said you know where where the dogs lick the blood of your wife it's going to be a bad time for both of you but uh unfortunately that's that's the way it's going to be and and we know that prophecy happened and and so here we are Ahab saying let let's go and and and deal with this and he had already just forgotten about it and that's one of the things that happens to us sometimes as as Christians I think when we backslide we can come to a place where we just forget our our our own salvation our our first love we can forget what God has done for us our eyes become dim to what he has done our memories become faint about how much of a transformation we've had in our lives and we can become a little bit pupped up and think that we cannot walk softly before the Lord and so we go and we act certain ways and here we have Ahab calling the king uh josephat to come down let's go to war and let's take our land not knowing that all he's doing is bringing to pass the word of the Lord wasn't he and josephat said this is verse four of second Chronicles chapter 18 josephat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today therefore the king of Israel gathered together of the prophets 400 men and said unto them shall we go go to ramoth Gilead to battle or shall I forbear and they said go up for God will deliver it into the king's hand but josaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and you know the prophet he said very clearly that josephat wasn't a back slider he said that he actually knew what was going on in this church in in in the behavior of these people and that's why he said that and and it's interesting to see that he would have that that understanding you know the 400 prophets prophesying go up take the land what more do you need you've got full permission don't you I mean did they take the time to examine an interview each and every one 400 Prophets brother bradam said they were God prophets they weren't backsliders he called them God prophets is there not hear a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of Israel said unto josephat there is yet one man yeah by whom we may inquire of the Lord oh but I hate him and why did he hate him we know the word say says it here he hated him because he never prophesied good unto me but always evil How could a God sent Prophet a Vindicated Prophet ever prophesy good about anybody who is a backslider the only thing he's going to do is bring judgment he's going to bring correction get back to the word of God Amen stop your shenanigans and get right with God that's all amen but isn't it interesting his reaction to it one more time he's got the opportunity someone else God's using someone else to bring the situation to pass one more chance to maybe accept the word of a god Prophet but yet he says no I hate him just because of every single time that I've been misbehaving all he's done has brought me correction and I could just never accept that alls he could do is just maybe handle me a little bit differently and then I would accept the correction how many times in our lives brothers and sisters do we actually go down that road where we say that maybe if the preacher would just handle me a little bit differently then I would get in line with the word of God God's using that man God's using that person to get us back in line he's not going to say oh I know you didn't like that the way that that brother he was just Rough Around the Edges that way and you just couldn't accept the correction according to my word it's not going to work we won't have that ability and the of Israel said unto josephat there is yet One Man by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil always evil that same is Micaiah the son of imla and josephat said let not the king say so don't be so hard on him why would you be so hard amen remember josephat knew who this Ahab was he knew who his wife was was he knew how they behaved and the king of Israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly makayah the son of imla and the king of Israel and josephat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering of the Gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them you could just imagine what that service must have been like hey they were having a wonderful service of Prophecy probably singing probably tremendous church service and zedekiah the son of chenai had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the Lord amen boy it changes everything when we hear thus sayith the Lord doesn't it thus saith the Lord with these Thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed and now I I just personally brothers and sisters have to say this there ain't no man-made Solution that's going to deal with a spiritual problem that's not going to happen amen and this God Prophet was bringing a man-made solution to a a a spiritual problem how on Earth could they ever succeed pushing out Syria with irons of horn horns of iron how could they ever do that that's not going to happen but but here we are zedekiah the son of chenai had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the Lord with these Thou shalt push out Syria until they be consumed what if he would have said by the armies of the Living God will you push out Syria but he had a man-made solution for this problem right and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramoth Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the [Music] king I I think this is real real good here and the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him and said behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one Ascent boy let the word therefore I pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good it would be a tough thing to discern you got 400 prophets over here and one over here how are you going to know the difference this is what I want to get to it's got to be spiritual Revelation am there's only one way you're going to know the difference there's only one way verse 13 and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth even what my God saith that will I speak now personally I would have to say if I was looking for a prophet that was a real Prophet one that was really tuned in with God I'd be listening to hear those words the words that say only what God says that's what I'm going to speak and it's got nothing to do with how I feel it's got nothing to do with what I know it's got nothing to do with what my tenure is or my experience it's only got to do with what the word of God is amen and when he was come to the king the king said unto him Micaiah shall we go shall we go to ramoth Gilead to battle or shall I forbear exact same question I mean it's pretty fair right if you're really examining it maybe scientifically or naturally like there's same question shall we forbear and he said go go ye up and prosper and they shall deliver it into your hand interesting that he would say it exactly the way he was instructed right but something constrained these others to say I I don't know what this guy's problem is now he's shoting now he's actually just being difficult with us he's just mocking us now right just go it'll be just like you said just like your Prophet said and the King said unto him how many times shall I adjure Thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord he came and said exactly what he wanted and that wasn't good good enough isn't that the way it is with some people and the king of Israel said to josephat did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil oh I jumped to the verse I jumped the most important verse didn't I verse 16 then he said I see all Israel scattered upon the mountain as sheep that have no Shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace and we know the king of Israel said to josephat didn't I tell you this guy wouldn't prophesy good but evil and again he said therefore hear the word of the Lord this is what I wanted to get to today brothers and sisters and just examine it a little bit we go from looking at the natural realm now we're going to change the camera as brother Bram says in different places we're going to change the view the perspective and we're going to step into the Heavenly realm we're going to we're going to see things from a different perspective here and again he said therefore hear the word of the Lord this is what you ask for now you have to have it now it's coming I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the host of Heaven standing on the right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up and fall at ramoth Gilead amen and One S spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner now this is all in heaven remember this is not down on Earth this is not in in a in a king's chamber this is all around the Throne of God then there came out a spirit and stood before the Lord and he said I will entice him and the Lord said unto him wherewith how you going to do it and he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets my not in the mouth of his soldiers not in the mouth of his family not in the mouth of the citizens of the Kingdom but in the mouth of His prophets very very very treacherous isn't it yes very treacherous how on Earth we say it that way but it applies how on Earth would we ever know the difference there's no way on Earth we would ever know the difference it's got to be his mind in us to know the difference that's good and outside of that we will be just as lost as those 400 God prophets even though we know the message of the hour they came out a spirit that stood before for the Lord and said I will entice him and he said unto him wherewith and he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets and the Lord said Thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also Prevail God gave him permission to go and do exactly what he said go out and do even so now therefore behold the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee can you imagine that day there we have the one God Prophet that was called out after all that that was said that was exactly according to the the theological teachings of the day we know that the ministerial associations they were all in Alliance with it all all of the the denominational chur churches they were in Alliance with it everyone was on board 400 God prophets were completely ready to just say yeah go on and take the kingdom it's ours Naturally Speaking everything lined up it was their land they had occupiers on it and nobody had right to that land except for the children of Israel but yet somehow some way there was a desire to hear one more word and that word is really what I want to preach about today brothers and sisters to think about it this is sort of what I do it's the punchline there ain't one of us that lives in this natural world in this life and doesn't have conversations just like this happening in heaven about us this is not just about God's Prophet even though that's the story that's painted it's actually about every single human being every single place in every situation all the time amen nothing happens unless God is involved nothing now some would say brother Barry that's going a bit far but remember we're not talking about man we're not talking about AI we're not talking about all that human beings can try and put together and muster up we're talking about God amen amen it goes beyond our comprehension we come to the place that's just beyond where our brains start to glitch where we just can't get asked it this is God he's as big as big can ever be and as small infinitely small it's God he knows everything in between but here we have this story painted in heaven I just think it's so wonderful to hear it in the word to to to read the story and see that you know there there's actually I I preached on this years ago and even once in Africa about there being a council in heaven and brother Bram says it there's a council in heaven for you that's actually a quote I'm not bringing it today but brother brandham says that about our situations our lives I'm not just making this up God says it when we have a situation in our life he's well aware of where we're at and what we're going through and I think it's just beautiful because when we pray he's listening he's not actually ignoring us he's wanting to see where we stand but this story is also told in First Kings chapter 22 and you know talking about this in light of Revelation if we can have the Revelation if we can have the understanding in our lives that you know there's nothing happening that God's surprised about he he he ain't a Doty old grandpa up there ring in his hands when situations happen on the earth and and and it sounds like things are out of control and maybe this country is going and taking over that other country and maybe this thing is happening and and somebody else is sick unto death and God is just ringing his hands like a Dodie old grandpa that's not what's happening at all it's a totally different thing it's exactly like we're reading here in this story he is saying in heaven who's going to get my will to come to pass in brother so and so's life or sister so and so's life or in that church or in that City or whatever it is we're talking about God here yes amen I think it's so beautiful to know that we have got the Revelation about who we are in the day in which we live we've got the Revelation to know that we have had a god prophet in our day call us back to the word of God and and and by that we've been given the keys to the kingdom which is just incredible you know we heard about it last week we have we we we look at it naturally and when we have a real serious incident or situation they call in the SWAT team right but we are the SWAT team he has given us special weapons and tactics amen and the greatest weapon that we have have is letting his mind be in US amen letting his mind be in us and cause us to act according to his word when we have that there's nothing that can stand in our way you know brother brandham said that we've got a nuclear bomb for the devil we can actually just give it to him put it in his lap and say there you go and how does that work that's by prayer amen amen that's by going on our knees and praying that's by taking the time with the Lord and and and we all can never do too much of it that's the one thing brother Bram said we'll never do too much of and that's praying but we know that Paul said that we should pray without ceasing and I I think that's a wonderful thing we can pray in many different ways we can have song prayer we can have thought prayer we can have word prayer there's many different types of prayer brothers and sisters but I I say the same thing what Paul said that's what we preach is what Paul preached just just pray without ceasing and you know when the word of God comes around don't let let it actually cause us to become defensive and maybe aggressive but let us just humble ourselves we sang that song just put me on the on the potter's wheel and mold me and shape me do we really want that to happen it doesn't feel good in our flesh when we get molded and shaped it it actually is uncomfortable many times but boy when it happens it sure feels good what what happens when we get correction in our lives when we get reshaped just a little bit it it it causes the the the fruit the Peaceable fruit to come forward in our lives that that that just passes all understanding we have the ability to to actually grow and we know that that's how we grow by learning by by correction in our lives and and every one of us needs it I I probably need it the most it's it's the way the Lord chose to do it you know and thank goodness for parents that aren't afraid to bring correction to their children there there's a world that we live live in now where parents actually believe that you don't need to bring correction to the children where you can just say yes to them and whatever they want just give it to them whenever they want it just give it to them it doesn't matter somehow some way it'll all work out and and it won't work out you're you're you're training the children to grow up to be adult children and if you think it's bad to see a little child throw a fit try seeing an adult throw a fit it's ridiculous but that's what this world is turning into people thinking that they can just behave however they will yeah everything's the same since the fathers fell asleep right nothing is changing oh my it's changing it's changing rapidly you know only Revelation from God will help us in the day in which we live when we look at this story here and think about the story of Ahab if if we were to go further and and see maybe we can just carry on and and and read this we got a bit of time here we'll pick up from verse 22 of 2 Chronicles chap 18 now therefore behold the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of thy these thy prophets and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee then zedekiah the son of chanah came near a and smot Micaiah upon the cheek this is the god Prophet remember the one who thought that he was the one he he was the highest esteemed of the bunch he liked to have his name and the lights and everybody to to to acknowledge him he liked to be that guy zedekiah and what did he do with Micaiah he came and he smoted him on the cheek and said which which way went the spirit of Lord from from me to speak unto thee like H how could you possibly think that you have anything to say and Micaiah said behold Thou shalt see on the day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself now I'm going to bring a quote and I think it's wonderful to hear how the prophet in our day paraphrases that scripture he doesn't add to it or take away from it he's not doing that he just says it in his own way and I think it's a pretty interesting thing verse 25 then the king of Israel said take he makayah and carry him back to Ammon the governor of the city and to joash the King's son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread of Affliction and with water of Affliction until I return in peace now just to be clear he's not saying to him take him back and give him the three Square meals a day like you would get in prison here in Canada he's saying take him back and punch his lights out and throw him in the pit and then dump water on him wake him up and slap him around again pour some Affliction on that boy don't treat him nicely because what did he do he embarrassed me oh no he embarrassed me in front of all the Ministerial Association he had another word a word from God that it embarrassed me and it hurt my pride it really tarnished my image now what am I ever going to do the king said take them and slap him around let them know who boss around here and and it's amazing because I can't help but think one day we're going to see an account for this exact story this exact scripture we're going to see Ahab have to actually give an account for the way that this man was treated God's Prophet my and maaya said behold Thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself because you're going to hide then the king of Israel said take him carry him back to Ammon the governor of the city to joash the King's son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread of Affliction and water of Affliction until I return in peace listen to the boldness of this guy and Micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the Lord spoken by me amen and he said hearken all ye people pay attention to my words remember what I said because it ain't going to turn out the way you think so the king of Israel and josephat the king of Judah went up to ramoth Gilead and the king of Israel said unto josaphat I will disguise myself and go into the battle why would he do that why would he go anywhere near the battle I I just think that's amazing it's quite bold go right into the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of Israel disguised himself and they went to the battle now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the Chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of Israel and it came to pass when the captains of the Chariots saw josaphat that they said it is the king of Israel therefore they compassed about him to fight but josaphat cried out and what the Lord helped him he wasn't as backslid as Ahab and God moved them to depart from him isn't that wonderful to think about brothers and sisters we can find ourselves Tangled Up in situations if we are not careful right we might think that it's just fine to hang out with a backslider and it's good to encourage backsliders but be very careful because they might take you into a battle that you can't handle and it might not just be a Temptation whereby oh my suddenly you're just tempted suddenly you just got this overwhelming Temptation it could be something that maybe comes upon maybe one of your parents that we could bring around because of our Behavior hanging out with that person maybe hanging out with that person could bring something upon one of our children we need to know exactly where we stand but I want to say this don't forget this verse here even though I've said things the way I've said just now therefore they compassed about him to fight many times there's Devils that Compass about us to fight but josephat cried out and the Lord helped him we could see the Lord help us too in our lives and God moved them to depart from him for it came to pass that when the captains of the Chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel it wasn't who they wanted they turned back again from pursuing him and a certain man drew a bow at a venture just to a guess just saw someone tracking along there anybody ever shoot a bow before you know what I'm talking about he saw someone just out there and just just took a guess just let it just enough just gave it enough Ark and just let it go on a venture and Let It Go my and smok the king of Israel between the joints of the harness he hid him therefore he said to his Chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for I am wounded and the battle increased that day how be it the king of Israel stayed himself up in his Chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died he got that arrow that Arrow it was just thrown at Adventure someone just thought you know I'm going to try and take a poke at this guy and and see what happens with my arrow I can't help but imagine that that Arrow was ordained of God it was exactly drawn by the right person had exactly the right time it had exactly the right weight exactly the right tip on the end of it it was exactly according to the word of God there was no accidental mistakes here or anything this was exactly according to the word of God according to the way the Lord said it would happen too and what happened is he didn't just lay there in the field I'm not going to go on about it but he didn't just lay there in the field fall out of his Chariot his Chariot went right back to where the dogs lick the blood out of the Chariot and off the concrete where they washed that Chariot out it's pretty terrible but it's true God is very aware of our situations he's very aware of Our Lives he knows exactly where we're at and when he brings us the correction according to the word our reaction will determine the outcome I think it's so beautiful I got a fairly long quote I'm going to read here out of anointed ones at the end time in 1965 William Mariam branam the Vindicated Prophet for this age amen he says he says here now here was that aaya thinking he was right he was the man that just loved to be esteemed Micaiah said let me ask God so he come down the next morning with thus saith the Lord he checked his vision with the word and you know brothers and sisters that's the critical factor for any one of us whether we say that we believe or understand that that God set a prophet in our age or not are we willing to actually align ourselves with the word of God many people say they are but not all the way they'll say that there's some sort of a cultural change something happened somewhere along the way maybe we're not living in an Apostolic age anymore who who knows what it could be but here here we have the the god Prophet saying let me just go and check it with the word I got a vision but I want to make sure it lines up with the word of God now if he would have said to zedekiah do you know what the prophet of the Bible here said would happen to this guy but not at this time because this man is an honorable man he is trying don't fail to get this he says he is trying to give back to the church the things that belongs to the church he's trying to give back its property back not the spiritual things he's trying to get the land he would have shook that whole nation like Elijah did but trying to give them the material things we own property we're a great organization we belong to it well all all you people you Protestants should all join with us uhhuh we're coming to that in a little bit it's all brothers and sisters anyhow isn't it never was and never will be with the real genuine Church of God it can't be it never was in in the Bible the the the real Believers were always the minorities right amen notice he saw the vision and so he said God spoke to me now Look the man was sincere and he said he said make these horns and go up before the king and push Westward or whichever the way the land laid from from where they were standing push and that'll be thus saith the Lord the he's going to win the Victory and come back a victory for the church my going to drive them out that's pretty close isn't it he's going to do something real special for the church here come Micaiah down said now you give your prophecy go on up but I seen Israel like sheep scattered having no Shepherd yeah exactly vice versa the 400 God prophets yes anointed by God doing something really good for the church and then you have one on the other hand bringing something real strong and seemingly nasty brother bam he says it's exactly vice versa now you're the congregation now which one is right both of them Prophets The only way you can tell the difference in them is check it by the word amen amen now brother Barry's going to say you could read the word a and you could see the situation and and you could say by knowledge I understand the word is actually contrary to that but Naturally Speaking we're not going to bring the right answers or the right results there's no way that we're actually going to see a a a spiritual solution with a natural answer just reading the Bible on its own getting head knowledge it's not going to do it for us it has to be a revelation amen and that Revelation in our day is Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's not about a prophet yes we understand that God uses prophets to speak to men and and that has to be the way it is because of his word Amos 3:7 we know that scripture surely God will do nothing nothing amen I could say it again nothing surely God will do nothing unless he reveals it first through His prophets amen here we have the prophets here now which one is right the one that's actually according to the word the one that's willing to actually take everyone back to the word even if it goes against popular opinion that's right just because everyone else is doing something don't mean it's right yes just because everyone else says something it don't mean it's right the only thing that's right is God's word amen he says now you're the congregation now which one is right both of them Prophets The only way you can tell the difference in them is check it by the word how you ever going to check it by the word if you don't have the Holy Ghost how you going to have an understanding of the word the way you're supposed to have an understanding of the word unless this mind which was in Christ is also in you how you ever going to get that mind in you just by reading the word of God it ain't going to happen you got to have the revelation of Jesus Christ that that actual baptism of the Holy Spirit has got to be in our lives then when we read this word it becomes a new book to us that's how we're going to see the difference said how do you get this he said I saw God sitting on a throne said I saw all the counsil around him now remember zedekiah said he just saw God too yeah In The Same Spirit I saw God he told me to make these horns out of iron the natural solution something natural and man-made we're going to take to solve this spiritual problem in the same spirit I saw God he told me to make these horns of iron out of iron go out there and push the Nations out of here for this belongs to us the others ain't got no right into it they would if they stayed right with God they would have had that but they got away from God that's the way the organization is the church it's got a right to these things everyone has a right to these things brothers and sisters all the organizations have a right to these things but you have been cheated out of it because you got away from God's word and God's spirit anointing to vindicate the word of the Season amen this going to pause there for a second because I'm not I'm brother Barry just ain't making this up here this is what the prophet of God said amen we've been cheated out of these promises if we're not seeing them in our lives because he's given them to us but the only way we're going to get them is by his Revelation in US God's spirit anointing to vindicate the word of the season to be able to say that yes indeed God did send a Vindicated Prophet nobody had a healing campaign like him nobody could discern the thoughts that were in the hearts of men it wasn't just a man standing there it wasn't just a a human being from the backwoods of Kentucky it was God standing in his man just just like in Micaiah it was God standing in his men giving him the words to speak the vision about where they stood and they had to have the they had to have the spirit of God to understand how on Earth could they ever understand it outside of God being in them now some might say brother Barry they didn't actually God didn't give the Holy Ghost back then I'll tell you what God gave the Holy Ghost to whoever he desired to give the Holy Ghost to amen he truly did let's just pause right there just just just on that note Let's uh let's let's go turn over to the Book of Genesis just to make a little Point here sorry I said Genesis I meant Exodus Exodus chapter 31 Pentecost was the pouring out of the spirit the acceptance of the spirit that was in Christ that was divided up at Calvary but he's God Amen and he can pour His Spirit out wherever he wants amen whenever he wants and he did in Exodus chapter 31 verse one says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see I have called by name balil the son of URI the son of her of the tribe of Judah and I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship to devise cunning Works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones to set them in a carving of Timber to work in all manner of workmansh ship so just to point out he can pour His Spirit into anyone amen anytime anywhere amen we're not talking about necessarily having the the the baptism of the Holy Spirit according to Pentecost but it's still the same Spirit brothers and sisters there's no difference between the spirit we could say that it's one of the three persons but then we have three different personalities distinctly and that's not the way the word of God is written when we look at it it is Jesus Christ the Lord God himself he chose a human name and that human name is Lord Jesus Christ amen we know that but he can pour His Spirit out on on anyone I'll just carry on with this quote here brother Bram he said they they would if they would have stayed with God they would have had that but they got away from God so they just weren't able to go into that that position and take that land back yet he goes on to say in 114 that's the way the organization is the church it's got a right to these things but but you have been cheated out of it because you got away from God's word and God's spirit anointing to uh vindicate the word of the Season he says don't you fail to get this messag and what it is that cheats us out of it it's where we would say that it's just fine to be baptized in the name of the father in the name of the son and in the name of the Holy Ghost what happens is we ground the power of God when we do that because the word of God says to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there is no disciple anywhere in the Bible in any Scripture that baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost we can say anyone who's a father in this room just raise your hand there's many fathers any sons raise your hand many sons many Spirit Holy Spirit I'd hope everybody would raise their hand and say right here amen but not of those is a human name right and as soon as we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what happens is Satan's power over us is rendered powerless and that's why he fights it so hard he doesn't want nothing to do with it that's the old time religion brothers and sisters where we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when we get that baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan cannot touch us I don't think there's anything else that we could ever want to preach about in this age in which we live through that baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got healing through that baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got Deliverance my how many people need Deliverance there's many things that we could need Deliverance for here how many marriages need restoration through the baptism of the Holy Ghost we become new creatures in Christ Jesus we don't become new creatures in Christ Jesus because we read the Bible and join a church all we are is good church members that know our Bibles oh my but just get to know him one time go to that intimate place not just know him according to head knowledge like we talked about in the Bible that word know means an intimate relationship and when that intimate relationship happens what happens there's a life that starts to grow inside of the believer and that life can only be one person Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says that's the way the organization is the church it's got a right to these things everyone has a right to them but you've been sheated out of it because you got away from God's word you said it's just fine I know that I've been baptized and I don't need to go any other way oh my but God's spirit anointing to vindicate his word in this season is there for anyone that's willing to take him at his word amen amen and you know what I would say today I would say to anyone who maybe questions it or or maybe doesn't understand it just try it just try it and see if it's not real he says notice what taking place now he said I saw God Micaiah did Sitting upon the throne in heaven his counsil was gathered around him he said who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab can you imagine God saying these words who can we get to go deceive him to make Elijah's words come true amen because God's word will always come to pass amen amen and many people would say w it was just Elijah's word even the prophet here he says who's going to make Elijah's words come true it wasn't Elijah's words those were God's words through his Prophet that was Vindicated my Prophet that was Vindicated I spoke that he would come and Elijah had my word the heavens and the Earth will pass away but my word will not fail amen I love how he says this I don't care how modern they get or how good they get or how educated they get or how big they are my words will never fail amen you know brothers and sisters in trying to do God a service without it being his will brother brandham preaching he says they had all the religious motion when it was time for the ark to come back to Jerusalem when David said hey that Ark is supposed to come here it's very similar to what what what's going on here in our story today with Ahab and josaphat isn't it very similar he knew that Ark was supposed to be in Jerusalem that was the Ark of the Covenant it belonged to them but what did he do he just went about it just a little bit wrong that's right he was supposed to have Levites carry that Arc amen over their hearts and what happened they built a new they built a modern religion and said we're just going to drive this cart right into where it's supposed to be there's no modern religion that's going to do it and brother bam he says that they had all the religious motion you can imagine they had the best instruments they had the best musicians they had the best programs they had the best singers they had the best choirs they had the best priests they had the best clothes they had all the best food the sacrifices everything was in order except for one thing and a man lost his life for it I just can't help but think how many people will lose their spiritual life for not accepting the word of God for this day why I don't care how modern they get or how good they get or how educated they get or how big they are my words will never fail and a lying Spirit came up out of hell just like we heard last week There's the regions of the natural and then there's some areas below and there's some areas above but right out of the areas below this angel came up this lying Spirit came up out of hell fell down on his knees and said if you'll just permit me oh my if you'll just give me a CH give me a shot and I'll just go do it I I'll just go and be a lying spirit in the mouth of His prophets my if you'll just permit me I can give them my anointing My Lying anointing and make them do any kind of a sign or wonder oh my maybe speak in tongues maybe in interpret maybe lay hands on the sick and they'll recover any kind of a sign or wonder just as long as I get them off the word he won't even know that it's your word he'll ignore it brothers and sisters don't let us ignore it he'll ignore it for popularity brother times hasn't changed right this is 19 when is this 65 the anointed ones at the end time this is a powerful message here my just as long as I get him off the word he won't even know that it's your word he'll ignore it for popularity brother times hasn't changed brother Neville that's true you remember that's true I'll get upon him I I'll make him do the same things the rest of them does I I'll make them prophesy and tell a lie yeah how could it be a lie and this is where it becomes what we the world would call Gray excuse me you know if you have a business and you deal with accounting many people have to deal with accountants anyways but when you have a business and you're dealing with accounting and you have things that you'd like to write off where you actually get a little bit of a credit a tax break you don't have to pay tax on those items so much and the accountants we had one that said you know maybe you shouldn't write that off and maybe you could WR you did you think about it you could write that off and we would say something else and and they would say well that's you know you're kind of stepping into the gray area you know how how gray do you want to be is what the accountant would say to us and I just thought it was so good because it's it's either black or it's white some people would say I noticed it's awfully quiet here some people would say there are great areas according to taxes so that you can get the biggest benefit and there are sure but it depends on how gray you want to go if you want to get into the really really dark Grays that's where you're probably going to get audited and have problems and at the end of the day you just get a big whopping tax bill back but when we're talking about the word of God it's black or it's white there's no no gray areas right and that's the trick of the devil to say while the devil's in the details we can just discuss it and and argue it and we've been given you know the the theological understanding and by the way what school did you go to I didn't go to a school for for for for for the word of God alls I did was go to the School of Hard docks and and through that I out of my misery in the life that I lived I actually had somebody introduce me to the Living God and I'll tell you what that was all I needed he actually changed my life in such a way I know people from my past brother qua you would be able to attest to it we we don't live our lives now the way that we used to live our lives uh we're different people we're new creatures in Christ Jesus and that's what happens to us it's not just someone going and getting head knowledge and it's so important to remember it has to be a re ation in our lives we can learn a lot in our human capabilities but to actually have it revealed to us is a totally different thing brothers and sisters he says that's true I'll get upon him make him do the same things the rest of them does I'll make him prophesy and tell a lie how could it be a lie because it was contrary to the word you take any of these false baptisms false so and soul I don't care how real it sounds how much they try to impersonate it's a lie if it's contrary to God's word of this hour that's so strong but hey it's true it's a lie some people might say well maybe it's just a an error maybe it's just a uh misunderstanding I'll say this if it is an error or a misunderstanding and the word of God brings correction then we're going to line up with that word aren't we that's where it is then it's then it's actually just a misunderstanding that can be cleared up or or maybe an error but aside from that it becomes a lie when we say nope it's exactly where I stand and there's nothing that's going to change me it becomes a lie if it's contrary to God's word of this hour that's exactly you say well ours well we did this and we do this and our church is that way and that he says I don't care if it is I could just imagine the reason I'm saying is I could just imagine can't you imagine brother brandom being Micaiah standing there telling Ahab and Jehoshaphat I don't care what it is if it's contrary to the written word for this hour it's a lie amen all the ministerial associations going oo you're searing us now we got to close the doors on this guy this guy's out you're never going to live this down and we know that's what they did they slammed their doors on them but that didn't stop the word of God from coming to pass otherwise we wouldn't be preaching it here today amen I don't care what it is if it's contrary to the written word for this hour it's a lie God will have nothing to do with it no matter how sincere how educated how smart how true it sounds how reasonable it sounds think about 400 God prophets they probably sounded really reasonable they probably sounded really really sincere but it didn't matter did it my I don't care how reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to the word of this hour we'll get into that a little deeper in a few minutes if time permits us and time permits Us in this message if you ever listen to it he gets into it a little deeper my he says or we'll take it up tonight he says notice he was a sincere good man no doubt and he said then otherwise maah said to him not not not right out to his face but other words you're Anointed with a lying Spirit wouldn't that be something to tell a bishop but he done it and you know brothers and sisters unfortunately I just believe it we have to stand in our position today and say that anything contrary to this word Vindicated word of the hour is a lie amen you're Anointed with a lying Spirit we know that there's many different anointings in this world there's many different Spirits in this world but there's only one or the other it's God or Satan it's good or it's evil and what's Evil Brothers and Sisters many times we would think about evil being a a raging monster someone that's really bad doing really despicable things anything contrary to the word of God is evil amen why we were talking about it you know over Christmas and I think it's important to mention even you can have evil parents you can have parents that aren't willing to actually uphold the word of God to the standard in which it should be held and you know what those parents are evil and what happens is they think they're shielding their children protecting them from maybe some things that they just don't like the parents don't like it's really hard and it's really difficult to do and it causes upset but it's either good or it's evil and it's important for us as parents to recognize we don't want to be evil amen it's not about going out and and doing despicable things it's just about actually omitting just just a tiny little bit of the word of God just leaving a little bit out that part that's really uncomfortable in our lives that's evil we could be Anointed with a lying spirit and we wouldn't want that for our families Would we not one bit not one bit he goes on to say and so this bishop walked up and said he'll never have Fellowship no more your ministry is finished you're over and what did he do he smacked him in the face and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when the time comes where we talked about a little bit earlier that there will be an accounting given of this day what will happen is when when this this bishop he sees the man that he slapped when he looks back at him he's going to see the face of Jesus Amen he's not going to see the prophet he's going to recognize what he did cuz he wasn't slapping the prophet in the face even though the prophet had to Bear the stripes for it he was slapping God in the face amen yes he was you'll never have Fellowship no more and smacked him in the face said you know that I'm a Vindicated man he was the one that liked to be polish remember my church made me the head of it this thing the popular vote of God's people made me this my organization made me this and God gave us this land and he intends for it to belong to us and I have thus sayith the Lord amen oh my smacked him and said which way the spirit of God go when it left me I better call the musicians I can see where getting to to close in time here he goes on to say Micaiah said you'll find out one of these days this is what we talked about a little bit earlier the Vindicated Prophet that prophesied things in the day in which we live he says you'll find out one of these days when California is Beneath the Sea out yonder and all these things see you'll see which way it went when you're sitting in the inner prisons when you say wow God really did send a prophet and wow all of those Visions in 1933 that we just read about on Wednesday night all of those Visions have been fulfilled wow we'll be wishing that maybe we got in line with it now Ahab what are you going to say I believe my prophet he said what if he just searched the word see he didn't he didn't want to see himself cursed hear me he didn't want to see himself cursed no man does nobody wants to see themselves cursed and my organizational brother that's what's the matter with with you you want to think that you're right when you know your heart when you're baptized using the name of father son Holy Ghost you're not just wrong you're lying amen and you know brothers and sisters I just want to say it this way if that sounds really harsh and sharp we can be anointed by a lying spirit it's possible that's what 400 God prophets had aying Spirit anointing them we can have that we're humans how many here has ever told a lie raise your hand go on I want to see it how many people's ever told a lie there's some that's never told a lie God bless you but for everyone else that's ever told a lie and was honest about it you've been anointed by a lying Spirit that's what's happened but somewhere along the way correction came right and as believers willing to say just be it unto me Lord just correct me put me on the potter's wheel let let me be shapen by your hands let me be just broken to pieces and then put back together the way that you want me to be put together and that's the way it's got to be in our minds sometimes people think that people are losing control when they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you ever listen to those messages at the ends of those messages people start screaming and losing it and brother bradam says there it is yes there it is let him go ask God for what you want because he's here right now Hallelujah he doesn't want to see us stuck under an anointing of a lying Spirit you know you say those things that you're doing and take initial evidences and all things like that you're wrong how can the initial evidence be speaking in tongues and then talk contrary to a promise of God in this hour how can it be you don't want the curse do you but here it's written so shall it be that's the mark of the beast or so close that it would deceive the elected if it were possible every sign every Wonder anointed man prophecy all kind of things going forth all kinds of signs and kinds of Wonders how you going to tell the difference watch the word for this hour amen imagine if the people in Noah's day didn't watch the word for that hour and you know you can only imagine that the people in that day didn't watch the word for their hour or if they did maybe they watched it and they mocked it as the word for their hour was manifest before them and and what happened was there was only eight Souls that were saved seven of them were the ones that were closest to Noah but they watched the word of the hour and they were able to be saved and we know that was just one word for one hour every single hour hour we're not talking about hours and minutes we're talking about spaces of time throughout history right every hour has a word for it and we know there's seven Church ages and I would say maybe there's seven hours we could word it that way but every single one of those hours has a word for it and we can choose to accept what God's Prophet chooses even though it's a contrary word to all of the other popular opinion am or we can line up with it and say wait a second I can see it in God's word God's word says that God's word says that he says watch Moses how he could have told balum watch Micaiah here maybe stand with me as we close how do we know he was right the word before him had prophesied that for Ahab I think this is just powerful brothers and sisters the word before him prophesied that this was going to happen Elijah the prophet said because of what you've done the dogs will lick your blood and that's what happened that's how it turned out for him in his day the prophet spoke the word and it had to come to pass the prophet didn't speak his own word the prophet spoke the word of God he was the mouthpiece for God and because of that this other fell came along we know that he wasn't a m what we call a major prophet he's a minor Prophet but he had the prophetic gift he uttered prophetically and God spoke and it had to come to pass exactly because you know it's so beautiful isn't it he spoke what was already spoken amen he didn't come up with a new word and if you take a look at the prophet for our day the word for our hour he only preached what was already preached boy I could just go on and on I'm so sorry I just I just think it's so beautiful to see the word of God in the day in which we live to have the Revelation it only comes by Revelation and when we have that Revelation the only thing that we want to do is humble ourselves to the word amen it's so beautiful Hallelujah God bless you today amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your gift of Revelation Lord thank you for your gift of of of Prophecy for us in the day in which we live Lord thank you Father for the ability to align ourselves up with that word for our day yes Lord we know that many people cannot and we know that even in your word the story that we read today there are so many people that just wouldn't so many people that just couldn't but we know father your word will never ever return to you void oh Father there's always going to be a response to your word and father this morning I pray that we would be able to just respond to your word as we close out this year as this year year comes to an end father that we would maybe just look back in our lives and and examine ourselves and say are we the same people that we were at the beginning of the year father if there's one one prayer that I have for everyone it would be that Lord we don't set goals to achieve things in our lives and and get wealth and and and get fit and do all these other things Lord help us to let your mind be in us that's my prayer father that Lord Jesus we would desire to align ourselves greater with your word than ever before in our lives Lord that we would see spiritual growth when we look back on our lives should you T at the end of 2025 that we would be able to say Amen praise God there was many trials tribulations many toils and snares but you brought me through them all Lord and I know that I have more growth in my life than I had when I went into 2025 father we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us be with those who are away father traveling Lord Jesus maybe for work father we pray for the brother Emanuel planning to move here from Cameroon Lord that you would just open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be closed father Lord we just love you we thank you we pray that you would be with our visitors as they travel back to where they come from Lord Jesus keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways now and Lord just give us a desire to line up with your word one more time we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen can we sing that song Here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up amen F my cup Lord I live come and qu this thir
