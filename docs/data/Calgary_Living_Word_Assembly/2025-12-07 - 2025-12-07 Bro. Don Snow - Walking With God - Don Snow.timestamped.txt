[33:54] Our dear heavenly father.
[33:57] Father, this morning we bless your name.
[34:00] Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we've come
[34:04] to say thank you for the life given to
[34:07] us once again. Father, not everybody
[34:10] went to sleep and came back alive. And
[34:13] here we are this morning, Father, with
[34:16] blood flowing in us. So, Father, we defy
[34:19] every every gravity and say thank you
[34:22] for your grace, Lord. Father, we don't
[34:24] deserve to be here this morning, Lord.
[34:26] Even how we drove here, we don't know
[34:28] how we did it because not because that
[34:31] we are good drivers, but your grace
[34:33] brought us here this morning, Father.
[34:35] And we want to thank you once again,
[34:37] Father, for bringing each and everyone
[34:39] from all over the city, across town,
[34:42] Father, to assemble in your name to
[34:45] worship you this morning, Lord. We want
[34:47] to say thank you, Lord. We do appreciate
[34:49] that, Lord Jesus. The roads are very
[34:52] treacherous, but we made it here this
[34:54] morning, Father. And we are here to say
[34:56] thank you. We are here to worship you,
[34:58] Lord. We are here to praise you and also
[35:01] to hear from you this morning, Lord. We
[35:04] believe that you have something for each
[35:07] one of us this morning.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; And as Father, our brother Dawn, one of
[35:12] us, Lord, you've chosen him, that vessel
[35:15] to speak to us, Lord. Father, we know
[35:18] that even if you can use the donkey to
[35:20] talk to your children, you can use
[35:22] brother Dawn to speak to us this
[35:24] morning. Lord, as our brother has
[35:26] labored, Lord, I pray that you help him,
[35:28] Lord, as he's coming forward to bring
[35:30] your mind. Would you calm his nails?
[35:33] Would you help him, Lord, to speak
[35:36] something for me, for my brother or my
[35:38] sister here this morning, Lord? We want
[35:41] to continue to father hold our pastor
[35:43] Lord who is troubled to Grand Prairie
[35:46] with some brothers Lord to preach your
[35:48] word. Would you help them as well this
[35:50] morning Lord Jesus? This morning brother
[35:53] Paul has also libert
[35:56] Lord would you help our brother and each
[35:59] one that has gathered here this morning
[36:01] Lord may we not be spectators but for
[36:05] Lord God may we be part of this service
[36:07] Lord. And we also want to remember each
[36:09] and every person, every need that is
[36:11] among us this morning, Lord. We never
[36:14] meet without any need among us, Lord. So
[36:16] I pray that Lord, you move from person
[36:18] to person
[36:20] &gt;&gt; this morning, Lord. At the end of it
[36:22] all, we shall be careful to bring thanks
[36:24] to you, Lord. We are bringing our tithes
[36:26] and offering. We pray that Lord, you
[36:28] receive it and bless it. For in Jesus
[36:31] name that we pray. Amen.
[36:41] Oh, it's hard to [singing] take the
[36:44] first.
[36:47] It's hard [singing]
[36:48] to take the first step when I don't
[36:53] [singing and music] know the way.
[36:56] Each step is so uncertain. [singing]
[37:00] But I learn to walk by faith.
[37:05] But you gave me that [music and singing]
[37:07] promise
[37:09] that you will never leave. [music]
[37:14] You will lead [singing] and guide me.
[37:18] And Lord, I do [singing] believe [music]

[51:41] Thank you Lord. We commit this service.
[51:44] Use me Lord I pray. Shut my mouth
[51:47] Father. The things that are not pleasing
[51:48] or not edifying Lord. Open my mouth and
[51:51] you speak Lord. In Jesus [music]
[51:52] Christ's name we pray.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:59] Thank you resistance.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:04] I'm just going to go straight into the
[52:06] word because then I know once I get
[52:07] talking about the word, I feel right at
[52:10] home. So, I don't want to make it
[52:11] awkward or you can be turning to your
[52:14] Bibles in Genesis 1.
[52:20] Just know that I love you all.
[52:24] My desire is just to bring a word of
[52:25] encouragement, a word of edification,
[52:28] maybe [snorts] help you in your walk.
[52:31] Yes.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Today I just want to talk about walking
[52:34] with God
[52:36] &gt;&gt; through the good.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; The very good and the abundantly
[52:40] exceedingly good.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about desire,
[52:45] pleasure, frustration,
[52:48] &gt;&gt; satisfaction, and perfection.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So here in Genesis 1:1,
[52:54] [snorts]
[52:56] in the beginning, God created the heaven
[52:58] and the earth.
[53:00] And the earth was without form and void,
[53:03] and darkness was upon the face of the
[53:05] deep. [snorts] And the spirit of God
[53:06] moved upon the face of the waters.
[53:10] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[53:14] there was light.
[53:16] And God saw the light
[53:19] that it was good. And God divided the
[53:22] light from the darkness. Amen. Let's
[53:25] turn to 31. 1:31.
[53:29] I wanted to read the whole thing, but
[53:31] this will at least give us a foundation
[53:33] to begin with.
[53:37] Genesis 1:31.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And God saw everything that he had made.
[53:43] And behold, it was very good. And the
[53:47] evening and the morning were the sixth
[53:49] day. Let's just bow our heads one more
[53:51] time. [snorts]
[53:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we approach
[53:55] your holy word, Father, you in written
[53:57] form, Lord, we find such encouragement.
[53:59] Father, we find [snorts] our substances,
[54:02] the things that we have need of, Father,
[54:03] Lord, Father, we just commit this word,
[54:07] Father. May you open it and break it
[54:08] Aresh to us, Father. May the full
[54:10] revelation of it, Father. Lord, not a
[54:12] partial re revelation just come forth in
[54:14] our lives, Father, and understanding
[54:16] that we could walk in it, Lord. We pray.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for this word, this
[54:20] word of life.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. [snorts]
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I noticed that I'm one of those
[54:29] brothers that always has a runny nose,
[54:31] so forgive me.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Greet you all in the name of the Lord.
[54:42] And like I said,
[54:44] I want to talk about walking with God.
[54:48] We're all in a journey. We're all here
[54:50] today. So therefore, we're we're walking
[54:52] with God. Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And here in Genesis, we can see where
[54:57] God said something
[54:59] and it happened.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; And all the way down through Genesis 1,
[55:03] it says, "God said this and it
[55:05] happened." God said this and every time
[55:07] he said, "It was good. It's good. It's
[55:09] good." Six times
[55:11] &gt;&gt; and then when he got to the end,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; it was very good.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; So there's something in there for us.
[55:19] Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I did a bunch of bit of a research
[55:22] that on this and uh because it meant
[55:26] a lot to me. It just struck me one day.
[55:28] It's like why? How did it change from
[55:30] good to very good? Amen. And this is
[55:32] just my nature, my personality, a gift
[55:35] you want. I'm very curious. Even when I
[55:37] was a kid, I would take my toys and
[55:39] smash them open because I wanted to see
[55:40] how they worked. But unfortunately, I
[55:42] didn't have the ability to put them back
[55:43] together, right? So, it kind of serves
[55:46] me well today. I'm a bit of a studyer. I
[55:48] get I get a hold of something and I
[55:50] guess brother Brandham called it
[55:51] prospecting. So I'm a prospector of this
[55:54] word. I just love diving into it
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and uh the Lord blesses us. Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So as you see here uh God said that it
[56:02] was good and this word actually means to
[56:04] ov the Hebrew
[56:07] and it just it's really interesting
[56:10] because as we know this word good is all
[56:12] throughout the Bible. But there's some
[56:14] other instances very good and
[56:16] exceedingly abundantly good that stand
[56:18] out. But if we look at this word uh
[56:21] good,
[56:22] it means that it was served its purpose.
[56:25] It it did come into existence and its
[56:27] purpose, but it wasn't very good yet.
[56:29] Amen. And that's uh I want to go to
[56:32] Satan's Eden. Sorry, I'll I'll settle
[56:33] down here in a second.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Let's just read a quote from the prophet
[56:36] because if anything, I can say I read a
[56:38] quote and we're safe in that. Amen.
[56:41] Satan's Eden 1965829
[56:45] paragraph 54
[56:48] and God knew that we would be here but
[56:51] then he put us in flesh so he would con
[56:54] be contacted in order he could be
[56:56] contact he became one of us when he
[56:58] became Jesus Christ the son of God
[57:01] himself the fullness of the
[57:04] manifestation of God and therefore that
[57:06] was God's purpose to desire his
[57:09] attributes in fellowship ship.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So, as we know before even Genesis here,
[57:14] the prophet taught us that God, the
[57:15] self-existing one, he had desires, he
[57:17] had attributes in him that he wanted to
[57:19] display. And I want to take Genesis here
[57:22] and show you how God first went about
[57:24] doing this because God doesn't change.
[57:26] So, we can see it in Genesis, we can see
[57:28] it all the way, and then we can see it
[57:29] in our lives.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; So, that's my purpose today is to show
[57:32] us maybe on our place of journey where
[57:34] we might be, but this is all on a
[57:37] journey, and it's the will of God.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God speaks things. He
[57:41] recognizes it. He says it's good. So if
[57:44] we carry on here, uh, paragraph 56, and
[57:47] as children of God, are you children of
[57:49] God? Do you profess? Is that your
[57:51] testimony?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's speaking to us. We are
[57:54] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[57:57] made flesh like he was made flesh. So we
[58:00] can have fellowship one with the other
[58:03] as a family of God upon earth. And that
[58:05] was God's purpose at the beginning. So
[58:07] in Genesis 1 when he started to do it
[58:09] was its purpose was to have fellowship
[58:12] but this is how he brought it about
[58:15] and that was God's purpose at the
[58:17] beginning. Yes sir. That's what God
[58:19] wanted at the beginning. So God wanted
[58:22] fellowship. He was all alone and he
[58:24] wanted someone to worship him. But more
[58:25] than that he wanted fellowship.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; He had everything under control.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; He turned man over into the Garden of
[58:34] Eden on free moral agency.
[58:37] said, "Son, it's yours."
[58:40] This was the beginning.
[58:43] What a beautiful place. [clears throat]
[58:45] Amen. God was so satisfied
[58:49] till he just went back and rested from
[58:51] all his works. Every tree never brought
[58:54] forth thorns and thistles. No berries
[58:57] ever come off of a throne, a thorn tree.
[59:00] Everything was perfect. Genesis 1-31.
[59:05] That was perfect.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; All seeds were perfect. Everything was
[59:08] in perfect condition. Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; So it went from good and when you get
[59:13] down to the to the uh 31 it says very
[59:16] good. So what happened was it was in
[59:19] perfect condition. It was all in harmony
[59:21] working together and serving his
[59:22] purpose. All of these individual
[59:25] creations now were working in harmony
[59:27] together serving the complete full
[59:29] purpose of God. Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] This was God's standard and it says that
[59:35] he was satisfied. Satisfied means he was
[59:39] pleased or content
[59:41] &gt;&gt; with what has been experienced or
[59:43] received.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; It means that it was paid in full. It
[59:46] came to full fruition of what he had in
[59:48] his mind. He was uh satisfied means that
[59:52] you're persuaded by argument or
[59:53] evidence. So the very thing was standing
[59:55] in front of him and he was satisfied.
[59:57] Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about this because
[1:00:00] most of my Christian walk, I was very
[1:00:03] frustrated and I was wasn't satisfied.
[1:00:07] And we'll talk about that. Maybe some of
[1:00:08] you feel that way here today that you're
[1:00:11] serving God and you have a desire in
[1:00:12] your heart, but you just seem to be
[1:00:13] always stumbling and falling and and and
[1:00:15] that thirst in you is not satisfied yet.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; But just know that desire, God put it
[1:00:21] there. It's good.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And when God says something, he's
[1:00:25] immutable, right? Whatever he says has
[1:00:27] to come to pass.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So that desire is leading you somewhere.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; So keep feeding that desire. Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; As we said the the good to the very good
[1:00:36] was in Hebrew was to
[1:00:39] it means very good.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good or to means good, pleasant,
[1:00:44] beautiful, functional, complete. That
[1:00:47] was the good. But in verse 31, the mud
[1:00:50] is literally means it's much, it's
[1:00:52] exceedingly, it's abundantly, it's
[1:00:54] utterly good. Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word mi actually amplifies.
[1:01:01] It means exceedingly good, abundantly
[1:01:03] good,
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; utterly complete or perfectly fitting.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That very good signals the perfection of
[1:01:12] the whole. Everything working together
[1:01:14] in divine order and purpose.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Remember, we want to bring this down to
[1:01:18] the individual, but we're looking in
[1:01:20] Genesis first. You got to be able to see
[1:01:21] it from Genesis all the way to
[1:01:23] Revelations. Amen.
[1:01:27] I guess you could say good described the
[1:01:29] parts that were right.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But the very good described the whole
[1:01:33] that was now in perfect relationship
[1:01:35] complete. Remember we fell from this.
[1:01:38] Amen. Right after this, God rested and
[1:01:41] then man has dominion over there. He
[1:01:42] brings them and puts them in the earth.
[1:01:44] Amen. So this actually means that it
[1:01:47] came to full maturity there in verse 31
[1:01:49] because he's saying it was very good.
[1:01:50] It's it's now uh in existence and it's
[1:01:52] all working together.
[1:01:54] exceedingly good, perfectly complete,
[1:01:56] overflowing in goodness is what that
[1:01:59] verse 31 means. Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; His purpose, the order, and the harmony
[1:02:04] were full, overflowing and abundant.
[1:02:06] Nothing lacking. Everything perfectly
[1:02:08] expressing his will.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; This is what we're to be restored back
[1:02:13] to.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Here now in the earth.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages. Good. Good. Good.
[1:02:21] Good.
[1:02:22] We get to enjoy the very good.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Not just good things, but good in total
[1:02:30] harmony the way God meant it to be.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Ireanius, and I'm not quoting brother
[1:02:36] Brandham here, but Arreinius, I I really
[1:02:39] studied the Greek and the Hebrews, just
[1:02:41] who I am. And Arinius, there's a bunch
[1:02:44] of St. Basil, a lot of them commented on
[1:02:47] this very good. What is it? One day I'm
[1:02:49] driving in my car and that thought comes
[1:02:51] to me. Lord, what do you mean by very
[1:02:53] good
[1:02:55] and then three months of it just moving
[1:02:57] and unfolding and helping me in my walk.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I'll just say it now so maybe we can get
[1:03:05] back to it is I met I was water baptized
[1:03:08] when I was about 20 years old. I
[1:03:10] backslid away when I was about 25 with a
[1:03:13] desire in my heart to serve God.
[1:03:16] 20 years with a desire to serve God
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; with a good thing in my heart
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; but constantly frustrated that I didn't
[1:03:23] have the ability.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; I felt like a hypocrite
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; because I couldn't live out the desire
[1:03:29] in my heart.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Constantly frustrated my whole life
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; but knowing I'm a son of God. How can
[1:03:37] this be?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; How can this be? Lord,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I had to learn patience the hard way.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's just me. You don't have you don't
[1:03:49] have to walk the way I walked
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; if this was maybe ministered at that
[1:03:53] time. But we know that maybe I would
[1:03:55] have been mature enough to receive it.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; But our lives are not meant to be full
[1:04:01] of frustrations with the word of God.
[1:04:04] Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; I now I will say a year and a half ago,
[1:04:08] my life completely changed.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I have the ability now to do everything
[1:04:13] that's desired in my heart.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; For a long time, I thought I had the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost, but my walk didn't prove it.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; It proved otherwise. There's an
[1:04:24] evidence.
[1:04:26] And the product, the product is very
[1:04:28] good, and it actually goes beyond that.
[1:04:31] [snorts]
[1:04:33] Let's talk about Enoch because Enoch was
[1:04:36] the perfect example of the bride, right?
[1:04:38] Joseph, Jesus,
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Enoch, and it's pretty interesting when
[1:04:42] you go and research Enoch, very little
[1:04:45] is said.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It's almost like it's a mystery,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; right? [snorts]
[1:04:51] You don't have to turn there, but I
[1:04:53] will. Genesis 5 21- 24. This is our
[1:04:58] perfect type. Amen. Of us. Hallelujah.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it and I'll read it.
[1:05:03] Enoch [snorts] lived 65 years and begott
[1:05:06] Methuselah.
[1:05:08] Now, right there it said Enoch lived 65
[1:05:11] years. [snorts]
[1:05:13] He had a son. But then it changes that
[1:05:15] Enoch walked with God. If you go back
[1:05:17] and look at the lineage, [snorts]
[1:05:19] there's only him and Noah where they
[1:05:20] said that he walked with God. The rest
[1:05:22] was they they were alive.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It was they're alive. But here there's a
[1:05:26] statement that says he walked with God.
[1:05:28] Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And it's one of the most
[1:05:31] descriptive ways that God talks about
[1:05:34] our perfect example is about he walked
[1:05:36] with God. What does that mean? What does
[1:05:38] it mean to walk with God? And I want to
[1:05:40] by the help of the Lord show you what
[1:05:42] that means today. So you'll know.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; You'll know beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[1:05:47] Enoch lives. And right here it shows.
[1:05:49] You'll notice that if you're wondering
[1:05:52] whether or not you have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:53] in the Bible it always says that he was
[1:05:56] such and such. It's a such a notable
[1:05:58] event that it says he was at this age
[1:06:00] and God appeared to him and spoke to
[1:06:02] them. Abraham, Enoch, it says right here
[1:06:04] he was 65 years old and then all of a
[1:06:06] sudden he started walking with God. It's
[1:06:08] an event that happened and it's put in
[1:06:09] scripture and you should have the same
[1:06:12] identification evidence in your own life
[1:06:13] that you'll know that there is no doubt
[1:06:14] I have the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Enoch lived 65 years and begat
[1:06:22] Methuselah. And [snorts] Enoch walked
[1:06:23] with God after he begot Methuselah 300
[1:06:26] years and begott sons and daughters. And
[1:06:29] all the days of Enoch were 365 years.
[1:06:32] And Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:06:35] for God took him. [snorts]
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; This is our perfect type and all it says
[1:06:40] that he walked with God.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Well, what does that mean? M
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; so we get another piece of uh evidence
[1:06:46] or description or something to work with
[1:06:48] where it says in Hebrews 11:5-6
[1:06:51] by [snorts] faith okay now we have
[1:06:54] another piece by faith
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated that he should not
[1:06:58] see death
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; and was not found because God had
[1:07:02] translated him
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; now this is the main point
[1:07:07] for before his translation he had this
[1:07:10] testimony
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; This is the point we have to get into
[1:07:18] our walk is where you have to know that
[1:07:21] you please God
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; because once you'll see that's the
[1:07:25] overcoming power. But
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; so he walked with God. He had faith but
[1:07:29] he he knew he had the testimony
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. He knew it.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; But without faith it is impossible to
[1:07:38] please him.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe
[1:07:41] that he is. And the prophet taught us
[1:07:43] that that's the I am. Even today, right
[1:07:45] now, we have to believe, not a god in
[1:07:47] history,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; your God.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:07:53] diligently seek him.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Now, they're they're together there in
[1:07:57] the Bible. So, they they they work
[1:07:59] together. So, I looked up the word, it's
[1:08:01] always kind of struck me, diligently.
[1:08:03] What does it mean to diligently seek
[1:08:04] God? [snorts]
[1:08:06] It means that you steadily seek God.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; You earnestly seek God. with energetic
[1:08:12] effort
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; painstakingly, [snorts]
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; exert considerable effort
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and care. This is how we're supposed to
[1:08:21] seek God.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; To search out, to investigate,
[1:08:26] crave,
[1:08:28] demand, require, and seek after.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we start to see now this
[1:08:32] this idea of desire. You have to desire
[1:08:35] this to see God.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And you have this the go after him with
[1:08:39] all that's in you. Yes.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; A lot of times it'll bring you to a
[1:08:42] point of desperation or crisis.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The desire in your heart to meet God
[1:08:47] will always bring you to an opportunity
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; to receive or reject the word of God in
[1:08:52] your life.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not just the message of the
[1:08:55] hour. It's the person of the message of
[1:08:57] the hour.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; For over 20 years, I accepted this
[1:09:02] message as truth. But I failed to walk
[1:09:05] in all of it.
[1:09:07] I hadn't received them as my truly as my
[1:09:09] Lord and Savior. I had an intellectual
[1:09:12] conception if you want to say or was the
[1:09:13] birth. It was something that was good,
[1:09:16] but it wasn't 100% satisfied in me yet.
[1:09:22] [snorts]
[1:09:23] Like I said, there's very little said,
[1:09:25] but he said he's a perfect type. So, I'm
[1:09:27] just going to read a couple quotes here
[1:09:28] about Enoch just to show what
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I'm sure all of you already know, but
[1:09:32] just to bring home this point here.
[1:09:34] God's only provided place of worship.
[1:09:36] 1965.
[1:09:38] The reflector doesn't reflect itself.
[1:09:41] The reflector isn't the reflection.
[1:09:44] There has to be something strike the
[1:09:46] reflector. The reflector to make it
[1:09:48] reflect.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; So a prophet is a chosen vessel of God
[1:09:51] that cannot reflect nothing at all. But
[1:09:54] he's in direct line with that
[1:09:56] reflection. [snorts]
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; He's in direct line of that reflection.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; God to reflect the image of Christ. the
[1:10:04] word. See, nothing else can do it.
[1:10:07] [snorts]
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where you come. You are a
[1:10:11] reflector.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; You have to be in direct line with God.
[1:10:14] That's what this message does.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the prophet had to eat
[1:10:19] the book. Revelations 10, you have to
[1:10:22] eat the book because you have to reflect
[1:10:24] something. Amen. That's the reason he
[1:10:26] had to eat the scroll. He had to reflect
[1:10:28] the word of God for that age. And he
[1:10:30] says, "You got it.
[1:10:32] It's
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; pretty simple.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You have to eat and reflect the word for
[1:10:36] your day.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Notice Enoch, God's perfect reflector
[1:10:42] and type. God was through through him
[1:10:45] with him. He just translated him, took
[1:10:47] him up. The mechanics that he had
[1:10:50] reflected become dynamics with the
[1:10:53] spirit.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And took him up.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; So this is what I'm trying to say that I
[1:10:59] would see in my own life. I had the
[1:11:00] mechanics, but I didn't have the spirit
[1:11:04] to make it live. I'd be able to come to
[1:11:06] church and worship God, and underneath
[1:11:08] that anointing, praise with everyone
[1:11:09] else, but as soon as I walked out the
[1:11:11] door, all of a sudden, my temper would
[1:11:13] flare. Or I'd be a different man at
[1:11:15] work, but thinking
[1:11:18] that that's life. That's the Christian
[1:11:20] walk. It's not.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; It's not. And thank God I can stand here
[1:11:23] and say today,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; it's not.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I no longer just come here and sit
[1:11:28] underneath the anointing. I walk out
[1:11:30] there and he's with me. He's living
[1:11:32] through me.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; This is what I want to encourage you to.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; The people are around you are telling
[1:11:43] you that you're not the man or the woman
[1:11:45] you think and you know, you respect them
[1:11:47] and they have the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And you'll know if you have the Holy
[1:11:51] Ghost because if you're still desiring
[1:11:52] the Holy Ghost and you don't have it
[1:11:54] because once you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:55] that desire goes away. Now you start
[1:11:57] desiring the things of the Lord. He
[1:11:59] starts working through you.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; It's more about reflecting God's only
[1:12:04] provided place of worship,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Moses was in him. Paragraph 271.
[1:12:11] Joshua was in him. And if you are in
[1:12:14] him,
[1:12:17] you was in him before the foundation of
[1:12:18] the world. Before Genesis one one,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; the family of God. You suffered with
[1:12:25] him. You died with him. You went to the
[1:12:27] cross with him. You raised with him
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and now you're sitting with him.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; You're still with him sitting in
[1:12:33] heavenly places.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; There's the evidence that goes with it.
[1:12:39] Amen. [snorts]
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Uh let's just go to the Easter Seal.
[1:12:44] Just bringing up more because Enoch is
[1:12:45] our perfect type. Amen.
[1:12:50] [snorts]
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 173. Let's take another man
[1:12:54] with this quickening power.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a man way long ago by
[1:12:59] the name of Enoch.
[1:13:01] [snorts]
[1:13:02] Enoch walked with God. Whatever God said
[1:13:05] do, Enoch never missed one word.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; He walked with God.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; What was he? He was a son of God. He was
[1:13:13] an eagle that had been called [snorts]
[1:13:15] to that day.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; So totally he was obedient to the word.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:26] 74. He was so full of that quickening
[1:13:29] power
[1:13:31] [snorts] and not one time had he had
[1:13:33] missed his word. Not one time did he
[1:13:34] misbehave himself. Not one time did he
[1:13:37] but keep the testimony. Everything that
[1:13:39] God told him to do, he went and done it.
[1:13:42] No argument about it. He just went and
[1:13:45] done it. No matter what anybody else
[1:13:47] said,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; what he had done, why he was full of
[1:13:50] that quickening power. And he ends it
[1:13:52] with that's the quickenity.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; I can honestly say that's what's moving
[1:13:57] in me now.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do make one choice in my
[1:14:01] I stumble and fall every day. Yes. But I
[1:14:04] apply the word which supplies the blood.
[1:14:05] It goes into sees God. See for I have no
[1:14:07] desire.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; As soon as I step in a line as soon as I
[1:14:10] make a mistake, I go and make it right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; The old dawn years, days, months, pride,
[1:14:16] stubbornness, whatever.
[1:14:18] and then be in misery because of the
[1:14:20] thirst in me, the soul longing to be
[1:14:23] expressed.
[1:14:26] [snorts]
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit gives you the ability to
[1:14:29] line up with the word in every aspect.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; No excuses. It said that [snorts]
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; walking gave them total obedience, but
[1:14:39] he only did it by the quickening power.
[1:14:41] We can't do it in our own in our own
[1:14:43] efforts.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Because if you do, that's
[1:14:46] self-righteousness. That's legalism
[1:14:48] because you're doing it for the wrong
[1:14:49] reason. You're not doing it in love with
[1:14:51] in a love with God and that you're doing
[1:14:52] it because you want to be perfect, but
[1:14:55] you're doing it your own effort.
[1:14:57] [snorts]
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; The first seal, Enoch, paragraph 154,
[1:15:04] Enoch typed the bride, right? So, I'm
[1:15:06] not lying about that. But Enoch walked
[1:15:08] before God, had a testimony. He pleased
[1:15:11] God with rapturing faith. Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; this quickening power brought him
[1:15:18] rapturing faith. And then we'll because
[1:15:20] he was the seventh from Adam. And then
[1:15:22] we look at uh Jesus testimony. This is
[1:15:24] in here ye him 1960.
[1:15:28] [snorts] I'm just I have a lot here. I
[1:15:30] have like 26 pages. So I just want to
[1:15:31] kind of hit the highlights and not just
[1:15:33] read it verbatim, but read the sections
[1:15:35] that stand out. Halfway down through 76.
[1:15:39] It says he took the body and set it on
[1:15:41] his right side and sent the spirit down
[1:15:44] here upon the church and the church will
[1:15:46] have to do the same this uh sorry and
[1:15:49] the church will have [snorts] to have
[1:15:51] the same spirit doing the same things
[1:15:53] that Jesus did or it'll never go in the
[1:15:55] rapture doveetailing. So he takes a, you
[1:15:57] know, a piece of paper and ties it. He
[1:15:59] says it has to come back together.
[1:16:00] Right? So this is the quickening power
[1:16:01] we're talking about. Halfway down
[1:16:03] through 77. That's exactly the way the
[1:16:06] church has got to be. Jesus was always
[1:16:09] about the father's business.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Doing that which was right in his sight.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Not just going about this and that what
[1:16:17] the church becomes to do,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; but it is about the father's business.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had the testimony, I always do
[1:16:24] that which pleases the father.
[1:16:26] So he knew it.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't just say it with the mouth.
[1:16:30] His life proved it.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; So this is what I I want to talk about
[1:16:36] is there's a testimony we have. But our
[1:16:38] our mouth and our feet have to be in
[1:16:40] agreement.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] if your mouth and feet are
[1:16:47] in agreement, that's head to toe. That
[1:16:49] is total obedience. You brought your
[1:16:50] whole body, your whole being into line
[1:16:52] with the word. Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a desire. And by the Holy
[1:16:55] Spirit, you can do this. If you
[1:16:57] surrender all, this is the quickening
[1:16:59] power.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It's not doesn't mean you're not going
[1:17:01] to have mistakes and failures, but what
[1:17:03] you're going to do is you're going to
[1:17:04] apply the word, make correction, repent,
[1:17:06] make it right, and then you're going to
[1:17:08] move forward.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; So, direct line with God. These are the
[1:17:16] points that were made. Uh, a reflector
[1:17:18] of the word for the day. quickening
[1:17:20] power, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[1:17:22] total obedience to the complete word of
[1:17:25] God, rapturing faith,
[1:17:28] and he pleased the father. So, this is
[1:17:30] what walking with God entails.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Now, the thing is is we're placed here
[1:17:36] on free moral agency.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So, God chose us just like in wedding
[1:17:41] veils. He said, "Will you marry me?"
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; What is our reply?
[1:17:48] Yes, Lord, I accept.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; But then there's a life that we live
[1:17:52] back in reverence and in love.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Free moral agency. It's our right to
[1:17:58] choose.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We have to choose life.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Not just on Wednesdays and Sundays or
[1:18:04] when it's suiting or when it in every
[1:18:06] aspect of our life.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; About six, seven months ago, I woke up
[1:18:12] one morning and this is what started all
[1:18:14] of this really. So I woke [snorts] up
[1:18:16] and I just said a simple prayer. I said,
[1:18:19] 'Lord, I just want to make nothing but
[1:18:21] good decisions today.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The last time I stood here, I testified
[1:18:25] that I made many bad decisions.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Now my testimony is every day I make
[1:18:31] nothing but good decisions.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And what does that mean?
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I truly want to only walk in the light
[1:18:39] of the hour. every
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; yes I stumble and fall
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; but I get back up. I repent. I go and
[1:18:48] apologize to my wife, my brother,
[1:18:49] whoever it is.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That's the perfect walk. It's not not
[1:18:54] making mistakes.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; It's applying the word.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; So I got thinking about this like Lord,
[1:19:00] I asked the Lord and I started doing it
[1:19:02] with my wife before we even left the
[1:19:04] room. We'd hold each other. Father, as
[1:19:06] husband and wife, as mother and father,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; we commit ourselves aresh this day. Give
[1:19:12] us the ability to only make good
[1:19:14] decisions.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The life now that's coming for it's it's
[1:19:20] not fulfilled fully yet, but our lives
[1:19:22] change dramatically.
[1:19:25] Yeah, we still have our issues, but
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; the communication, the the life, the
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; all I care about now is the peace and
[1:19:32] joy, keeping in my home, not my selfish
[1:19:34] pride or this or that,
[1:19:37] keeping that love and that joy.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The joy that I now have in my heart
[1:19:44] because the thirst that I had has been
[1:19:45] satisfied because the Holy Spirit
[1:19:47] satisfied it.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; So many times I'd act out and, you know,
[1:19:51] be frustrated and mad. It was because I
[1:19:54] had such a thirst in me that wasn't
[1:19:56] satisfied and that was how it would show
[1:19:58] itself.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I can say I'm satisfied.
[1:20:06] [snorts]
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I started researching choices and what
[1:20:08] did academia say and it's a common theme
[1:20:12] that almost all academia says that we
[1:20:15] make about 30 to 35,000 choices a day.
[1:20:19] It's about one every two seconds.
[1:20:22] A lot of them are involuntary, habitual,
[1:20:24] just
[1:20:25] but they say that we make about one to
[1:20:28] three decisions a day that are
[1:20:30] lifealtering decisions.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Remember even when Cadre was here, he
[1:20:36] goes, you can be at a step and just
[1:20:38] running parallel for a very long time.
[1:20:44] What I've learned now is that to walk
[1:20:46] with God is to invite him into all of
[1:20:49] our decisions.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Work, home,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; in our kitchen, in our living room, in
[1:20:55] our bedroom.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to love and serve
[1:21:01] God is to invite him. And what does that
[1:21:02] mean? To apply the word that we received
[1:21:05] through a prophet.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus did. [snorts] He only
[1:21:11] walked in the word for his day.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; It's like [snorts] firing a rifle.
[1:21:16] Brother Brown said, "You fired, you're
[1:21:18] off, you know, a fraction of a
[1:21:20] millimeter here, but you get out 300
[1:21:22] yards, it's off three inches."
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be off three inches.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking about our part. Yes, God
[1:21:30] is waiting there to do everything for,
[1:21:32] but we have to choose. A pardon is not a
[1:21:34] pardon unless it's received as a pardon.
[1:21:37] Life is not life unless it's received as
[1:21:39] life.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I had to learn this and I can tell you
[1:21:42] the fruit of it is just beautiful.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. [snorts]
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I'm becoming the man that I always
[1:21:49] desired to be.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; The husband, the father,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; the deacon,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I wake up now with such purpose,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; not in myself serving the life that he's
[1:22:01] put in me.
[1:22:04] I started thinking about you know
[1:22:07] walking with God choices but
[1:22:10] it's we take about everyone about 10,000
[1:22:13] steps right so we make 30 actually it's
[1:22:15] I'll say it's 35,000 choices but just to
[1:22:18] put it in a natural sense that you know
[1:22:21] [snorts] you start seeing people and
[1:22:22] they want to better their lives and
[1:22:24] they're like they start walking
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; right simple thing not strenuous
[1:22:29] they start walking they become [snorts]
[1:22:31] healthier next thing they're
[1:22:33] Hey, I'm not getting enough water. And
[1:22:35] you start seeing them carrying around. I
[1:22:37] see brother Andrew sometimes carrying a
[1:22:38] big thing of water. [snorts] All of a
[1:22:40] sudden, you start thinking about more
[1:22:42] healthy conscious. Okay, I'm walking. I
[1:22:44] need more water. You start paying more
[1:22:46] attention. Now, remember, I'm talking
[1:22:47] natural. Think spiritual.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You're making better choices. All of a
[1:22:51] sudden, now you start drinking more
[1:22:52] water and you feel better. Next thing
[1:22:54] you know, you start paying attention
[1:22:56] what food you eat, your calorie, your
[1:22:58] intake,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; at what time you eat. you know, [snorts]
[1:23:01] is it too sugary? Or Sister Lisa and the
[1:23:04] people on keto, Sister Judith and that,
[1:23:06] they they started watching their diet.
[1:23:07] [snorts]
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm good at least that was your
[1:23:13] testimony, sister. [laughter]
[1:23:16] [snorts]
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; So, you start counting. You start
[1:23:18] watching your food intake. Next thing
[1:23:20] you know, you start stretching. You
[1:23:21] become more flexible. You're not as
[1:23:23] stiff or legalistic as you used to be.
[1:23:27] Next thing you know, you're like, "Man,
[1:23:29] I could probably even do better." You
[1:23:30] start maybe lifting weights a little
[1:23:31] bit. You start, you know, getting
[1:23:33] stronger so you can carry your brother
[1:23:35] and your sister.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you got better
[1:23:39] blood circulation, right?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, people are like, "Man,
[1:23:44] how'd you do?" Now you have knowledge.
[1:23:46] How'd you do this? Well, I did this and
[1:23:48] I did that. And so people are coming to
[1:23:50] you now for advice. Like, man, how how
[1:23:52] did you become the person you are?
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Right? [snorts] That's good.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you got better
[1:23:57] cardio.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; You're not just walking. Maybe you're
[1:23:59] running [snorts] cuz the old man's dead.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe you become a fine specimen. Maybe
[1:24:06] even the stature of a perfect man.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Steps, choices.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; My testimony is is that about a year and
[1:24:17] a half ago, I shed about 200 lb of this
[1:24:21] old man, but unfortunately I 255 pounds.
[1:24:25] So, I have a little bit more work to go.
[1:24:27] I hope you know what I mean.
[1:24:29] It was a great victory in my life.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; But it came to a point where I had to
[1:24:34] choose. It was a crisis.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And it was either all or nothing.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; That's how I felt. It was either walk
[1:24:42] away from the message yet again.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I couldn't go back.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord asked me for all.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, I'll give you all."
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And he's honored it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He's given me his Holy Spirit. Not just
[1:24:56] a baptism. The Holy Spirit,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; that gives me the strength to be able to
[1:25:01] stand here today and talk with
[1:25:02] conviction because I've experienced it.
[1:25:04] I'm not talking about something that I
[1:25:05] don't know. I've experienced it.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Become a notable difference.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe [snorts] now you're full of life.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You have a glow. Do you ever see healthy
[1:25:15] people? They have a glow about them.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual fitness.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; They become happier,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; more energetic.
[1:25:26] You
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; start living with a purpose.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You're able to do those things that you
[1:25:31] always desired to do, but you didn't
[1:25:33] have the ability to do it because of
[1:25:34] lack of mobility or no energy, no
[1:25:36] strength.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Psalms 37:23:24, [snorts]
[1:25:44] the steps of a good man, so here's this
[1:25:46] word again, good,
[1:25:48] are ordered or established
[1:25:51] by the Lord.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And he delightth. So here's this
[1:25:54] satisfaction or desire.
[1:25:57] In his way,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; though he fall,
[1:26:01] he shall not be utterly cast down.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I can say there I am.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; I've fallen a million times. I've gotten
[1:26:11] up a million times. [snorts]
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; My falls are less frequent now.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Because I've learned instead of falling
[1:26:18] and scraping my knees, I now learn to
[1:26:19] just kneel down on my knees first and
[1:26:21] avoid the scrape. Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I learned that the hard way.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Invite the Lord into your life.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; For the Lord upholdeth him
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; with his hand. Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. [snorts]
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; I just I guess the best way for me to
[1:26:39] kind of want to show this and maybe for
[1:26:41] the young people here is we're walking
[1:26:43] with God.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; We said there's about 35,000 choices a
[1:26:47] day.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to do good. Yes,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; I want to do good.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I make a selfish mistake.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Bad mistake.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Bad.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Bad. [snorts] But the Lord is so good.
[1:27:06] Donald, get back in step.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to do that.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Honey, forgive me.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:27:22] Good,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; good,
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; good,
[1:27:27] bad,
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; bad. Oh Lord, forgive me.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; See how your walk changes?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Then it's good,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; good,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; bad. No, good.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Good. That is the life that I want to
[1:27:42] live.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Everything we have need of lays in the
[1:27:45] Bible and the message.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Consult the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Everything we have need of is in the
[1:27:51] word.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You don't never want to take a step
[1:27:53] unless you know 100% the Lord is in it.
[1:28:00] [snorts]
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we're on free moral agency and we
[1:28:01] have to make choices. And we're told
[1:28:04] there's two influences in the world,
[1:28:05] only two.
[1:28:08] And these influences are truly actually
[1:28:11] desires. There's a desire of the soul
[1:28:14] and there's a desire of the flesh.
[1:28:18] desires influence our decisions and our
[1:28:20] walk
[1:28:24] thoughts into captivity.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; That is how I'm choosing to walk. It
[1:28:29] becomes easier and easier and easier at
[1:28:31] first. It's it's so humbling because you
[1:28:34] start to see how many bad choices you've
[1:28:36] actually made. But it's good because God
[1:28:38] is still blessing your walk.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; So, let's just talk about Abraham
[1:28:42] because he's the the father of faith,
[1:28:44] correct? And we're the royal seed of
[1:28:45] Abraham. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:50] And here it is again. It's it notes a
[1:28:53] time. See, that's what I'm saying there.
[1:28:55] The pastor has been preaching it. There
[1:28:57] is a day. There is an hour when you know
[1:29:00] you've got the Holy Ghost. You do.
[1:29:03] Abraham [snorts]
[1:29:04] was 99, sorry, 90 years old and nine.
[1:29:09] The Lord appeared to Abraham at
[1:29:12] visitation. Amen. and said unto him, I
[1:29:15] am the Almighty God.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Walk before me and [snorts] be thou
[1:29:20] perfect.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Perfect. I looked it up. Walk with
[1:29:28] integrity.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Walk in truth.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Without blemish, without spot, complete
[1:29:34] full without or sorry, undefiled,
[1:29:38] uprightly and whole.
[1:29:41] just walk before me and be spotless.
[1:29:44] It's not the type of spotless we think
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean that you're not g you're
[1:29:48] gonna fight your old man
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; every day of your life,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Some days are going to feel better and
[1:29:54] others sometimes you're going to, man, I
[1:29:55] hardly hardly fell today. The very fact
[1:29:58] that you're standing there in that flesh
[1:30:00] body,
[1:30:05] we're in need of his mercy and his
[1:30:06] grace. And this is so there's those of
[1:30:09] us that have walked away and come back
[1:30:10] and back, you know, backslid and we
[1:30:12] fought rock and roll sex. And then
[1:30:14] there's the sons and daughters that
[1:30:16] never went away, but you have to fight
[1:30:17] self-righteousness because you're like,
[1:30:18] "What do I need to be?" You were born in
[1:30:20] sin, shaped in iniquity.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You still need the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Walk before me and be thou perfect.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And I will make my covenant between me
[1:30:31] and thee. I will multiply thee
[1:30:34] exceedingly. Now if you go back and read
[1:30:36] the Hebrew on this, it says exceedingly
[1:30:39] greatly which is mahood mahood. So this
[1:30:42] is the abundantly exceedingly.
[1:30:46] So we go from good to the holy very good
[1:30:49] and now all of a sudden you're going to
[1:30:50] walk good goodly good mood what however
[1:30:54] you want to but it's abundantly
[1:30:55] exceedingly more than you'll be a better
[1:30:57] man than you ever thought a better woman
[1:30:59] than you ever thought because you're
[1:31:01] going to allow the Holy Ghost to reign
[1:31:02] in your life and it's going to look so
[1:31:04] humble and so sweet and so simple but
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; you're a spiritual giant
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; maybe other people around you don't know
[1:31:10] it
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; but demons are afraid of you
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; we'll get there Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; And this is God's God chose to do this,
[1:31:18] but you have to choose to accept it.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Not just to quote it with your mouth to
[1:31:23] take what I understand now. I used to
[1:31:24] hate this flesh body. I used to hate
[1:31:26] everything about it. Now I understand
[1:31:28] it's a tool in my hands. I have to be
[1:31:30] able to make contact with the co-workers
[1:31:32] around me.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; But I understand now it's actually now
[1:31:37] this is just a dawn thought, but this
[1:31:39] gives me such strength.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. that
[1:31:43] Satan now is so close to me. This inner
[1:31:46] man is so much stronger than this flesh
[1:31:48] that every morning I get to wake up and
[1:31:49] grab this flesh man by the throat
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; and throw him underneath my feet.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It's a choice.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; You can choose to do it.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's being the light of the world.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; He's still going to fight you. He's
[1:32:04] going to wrestle you and he's going to
[1:32:05] every once in a while get a punch in,
[1:32:07] but for the most part
[1:32:10] because Our husband put all things
[1:32:13] underneath his feet.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And if we're baptized in into him, his
[1:32:16] body, then if we're in him and he's in
[1:32:19] us, then Satan's underneath your feet.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it by faith and
[1:32:23] make start making good choices. And
[1:32:24] you'll see it. You'll see the evidence.
[1:32:26] God said, it's true. So therefore,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; it'll be you have to choose to walk in
[1:32:32] it. That's what faith is. If you desire
[1:32:34] to be free and and live above it, that's
[1:32:37] that desire means that it's warning you
[1:32:39] that you're able to do it.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; But it starts with a desire.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham fell on his face. Amen. Good
[1:32:49] choice, Abraham. [snorts] And God talked
[1:32:51] with him, saying, "As for me, behold, my
[1:32:54] covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
[1:32:55] a father of many nations. Neither shall
[1:32:58] thy name sorry neither shall thy name
[1:33:02] any more be called Abram that there
[1:33:04] should be called Abraham for a father of
[1:33:07] many nations have I made he already made
[1:33:09] him it that's what I'm trying to say
[1:33:11] he's already made you why he's justified
[1:33:13] you go already glorified you just had to
[1:33:16] start walking in that revelation
[1:33:19] it's going to be hard at first
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; but that's what our whole walk is about
[1:33:22] is to get to that point to become what
[1:33:24] God already said you are you have to
[1:33:26] work your help You're going to work with
[1:33:27] God to make it come to pass.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; For Abraham, it was decision time. He
[1:33:36] could be he could have listed all the
[1:33:37] reasons in his mind. What you talking
[1:33:38] when I'm 100 years old I've done? He
[1:33:41] chose to accept it. He still stumbled
[1:33:44] and fell
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; when God told him that. He still w it
[1:33:47] was 13 years before he actually did it.
[1:33:50] He had Lot with him and all these other
[1:33:51] things. It was finally that he actually
[1:33:53] said got back in line. He got probably
[1:33:55] so desperate that once he finally did
[1:33:58] what God asked him to do, God blessed
[1:33:59] him and he became all of a sudden the
[1:34:01] promised son comes.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what we do is that I have to
[1:34:06] walk from here to here and I'm going to
[1:34:08] end up there because my footsteps are
[1:34:10] order. It's just either I'm going to
[1:34:11] come the easy way or the hard way.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I'm choosing to go the easy way now.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:22] Hebrews 11:13-16.
[1:34:25] These all died in faith, not having
[1:34:27] received the promises, but having seen
[1:34:30] them a far off, and were persuaded of
[1:34:32] them and embraced them. Now, this in
[1:34:35] Hebrew right here means that they
[1:34:36] anticipate it with pleasure.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; There was a desire in them, and they
[1:34:42] knew, but they didn't receive it, but
[1:34:43] they they anticipated the pleasure, the
[1:34:45] fulfillment of it. For they say uh
[1:34:48] sorry, embraced them and confessed. So,
[1:34:50] here's a testimony that they were
[1:34:52] strangers and pilgrims. So, they're
[1:34:53] standing here. He's like, "Man, there's
[1:34:54] something else in me. I I don't seem to
[1:34:56] fit in in this world. I don't seem to be
[1:34:58] at peace. I'm always frustrated in my
[1:35:00] life." And he goes, "I I'm not of this
[1:35:02] world. This is not my home." And because
[1:35:05] of this testimony, [snorts] it says that
[1:35:08] for they that say such things declare
[1:35:10] plainly that they seek. And this word
[1:35:12] seeks means that they inquire for, they
[1:35:14] [snorts] intensively, they intensively
[1:35:16] to demand, they crave, they desire.
[1:35:18] Here's this this word keeps popping up.
[1:35:20] Desire and pleasure, satisfaction.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; They declare plainly that they seek a
[1:35:26] country. And then it says, "And truly,
[1:35:28] if they had been mindful of that
[1:35:29] country, so the one they came out of,
[1:35:31] they lost memory of it. They started
[1:35:33] seeking what they were looking for and
[1:35:34] they forgot actually where they so they
[1:35:36] didn't even go back." Amen. Came out,
[1:35:39] they might have had an opportunity to
[1:35:40] return. But now they desire, which is
[1:35:43] means to stretch oneself, to long for or
[1:35:45] covenant after. So now they desire a
[1:35:48] better country.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That is a heavenly wherefore God. So
[1:35:53] because you say I desire something
[1:35:55] better than this life that I have here
[1:35:57] now. God is not ashamed to be called
[1:36:00] your God, their God. And he's already
[1:36:02] prepared it. So you're hungering for
[1:36:03] something that God's created, but you
[1:36:05] can't see it. Now that's faith.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; God created this. It's already made,
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And he's like, you're inhabitant of it.
[1:36:11] Now all of a sudden you're walking. I
[1:36:12] know I'm going somewhere. I know I'm
[1:36:14] going somewhere.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Right? You're longing after something
[1:36:17] that you can't see yet.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's some people here longing
[1:36:19] for a husband or a wife. If you have a
[1:36:21] desire for it, the Bible teaches that
[1:36:23] God will fulfill it.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Because that desire is there for a
[1:36:26] reason.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And that's how things begin with God.
[1:36:30] There's either a carnal desire of the
[1:36:32] flesh or there is a desire of the soul.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And if your soul is longing for a
[1:36:37] husband or a wife or God is obligated
[1:36:39] because he's the one that put that
[1:36:40] desire. You have to understand where
[1:36:42] desire comes from.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] Amen. They desired an invisible city,
[1:36:48] the land that God promised them.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. [snorts]
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So when we walk in the new city, oh this
[1:36:55] I heard this years and years ago, but
[1:36:57] there was an engineer in the message and
[1:37:00] he did the math and the dimension, you
[1:37:02] know, 1500 miles square, 1500. And he
[1:37:05] actually did the math and he said if you
[1:37:06] were walking up the side of that, you
[1:37:08] wouldn't even know you're walking
[1:37:09] uphill. The why I'm saying that is
[1:37:11] that's how easy this walk actually
[1:37:13] becomes. Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Because your faith muscle builds and the
[1:37:17] more Satan comes, you're like,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; "God has been with me the last 10,000
[1:37:20] decisions.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It came out well."
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Beat it.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Beat it. I'm not entertaining." Because
[1:37:27] you have a choice to entertain Satan's
[1:37:29] thoughts or God's thoughts.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; That's just how simple this walk is. But
[1:37:33] the problem is is we fill ourselves with
[1:37:36] all this other garbage and we start
[1:37:37] doubting our walk.
[1:37:39] It's going to build up your faith to a
[1:37:40] point where you know you're you you
[1:37:42] please God.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; He's your husband
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and he's pleasing. Is he not pleasing
[1:37:46] you? So then you have this relationships
[1:37:48] that builds strength.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; now all of a sudden I'll show you over
[1:37:52] here. He says that you're more than a
[1:37:53] match for the devil. Not by yourself but
[1:37:55] in that relationship. Amen. Numbers uh
[1:37:59] 14. So that was what was given to uh
[1:38:03] Abraham. And we see it again here now uh
[1:38:05] Joshua and Caleb. Numbers 14:6-9.
[1:38:09] And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the
[1:38:12] son of Japna,
[1:38:14] which were the of them that searched the
[1:38:16] land, rent their clothes. And they spake
[1:38:18] on all the company of children of
[1:38:20] Israel, saying, "The land that we pass
[1:38:23] through to search it is an exceedingly
[1:38:26] good land."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Now, here this is again, it's actually
[1:38:32] [snorts]
[1:38:33] uh same thing as what Abraham said. It's
[1:38:35] exceedingly great. It means mahood.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Mahood.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; If the Lord delight in us, Amen. There's
[1:38:44] the credential. Then he be he will bring
[1:38:47] us into this land and give it us a land
[1:38:50] which flowth with milk and honey.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; So this milk and honey, I looked it up
[1:38:55] in the Hebrew and that
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I have four pages here on it, but I'll
[1:38:58] just read a summary in that of it. The
[1:39:00] milk speaks of your basic needs, your
[1:39:03] substance, the fat that you need, the
[1:39:04] calories that you need, and it's filled
[1:39:06] with the land is full of it. There's
[1:39:08] places where we can graze our animals.
[1:39:10] All of our basic needs are met. That's
[1:39:12] good. But then this this honey, it
[1:39:15] wasn't bees. It's of the fig and it's
[1:39:18] very, very sweet. So, it actually speaks
[1:39:20] of over it's actually uh luxury if you
[1:39:24] want to say it's over and above what you
[1:39:26] would what your basic needs are. This is
[1:39:28] what the means to be in the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; A life fully supplied, fully satisfied,
[1:39:34] fully blessed, both nourished and
[1:39:36] delighted under the covenant of the care
[1:39:38] of God.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; That's what this milk and honey means.
[1:39:41] Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; We're not just here to be survive and
[1:39:44] make ends meet.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; He's going to take care of our needs and
[1:39:49] then give you even more than what you
[1:39:51] would think.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; But here's the credential. Only rebel
[1:39:55] not against the Lord. Right. [snorts]
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; It's a warning. Neither fear ye the
[1:40:00] people of the land. Don't fear the
[1:40:01] giants. Don't feel those genetic
[1:40:03] defects. If you want to say we got down
[1:40:04] through our f you can overcome them.
[1:40:06] They're there for you to overcome to
[1:40:07] show the power of God.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; They are bred for us. Defense. Their
[1:40:13] defenses departed from them. The Lord is
[1:40:15] with us. Bear them not. So if you can
[1:40:16] stand and know the Lord is with you,
[1:40:18] just walk forward. Brother Brham said
[1:40:20] you're going to fight for every inch.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Every inch. But wherever your feet lay.
[1:40:25] So claim your life. Claim your victory.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Don't just say it with your mouth. Give
[1:40:29] God what I've learned now is when I give
[1:40:32] God what? My best.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; God will take it just like the fishes
[1:40:36] and the loaves
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; and increase it tfold more than you
[1:40:40] could ever ever dream or imagine. Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I'm curious to see how far that will go
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; because my desire is not to be rich
[1:40:49] because I want it's to provide a safe
[1:40:51] haven
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; for my family, my wife, my to be able to
[1:40:55] help other people. It's not a selfish
[1:40:57] motive. And there's nothing wrong if you
[1:40:58] have a desire for a nice car. Absolutely
[1:41:00] go for it.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; But if your motive is correct,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; God will bless it
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; more than you could ever think. Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe a little hint for a wife. What
[1:41:12] husbands? What I've come to understand
[1:41:13] now is that women are made different
[1:41:14] than men.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Women have a desire or a need to be
[1:41:22] feel safe
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; constantly.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Constantly. And we're men and we're made
[1:41:27] the other way. We're like, why? Because
[1:41:28] we always feel safe
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; because we have the strength.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; So the need in your wife is there to
[1:41:35] help you humble yourself and share your
[1:41:36] strength. If you learn to humble
[1:41:39] yourself
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and help your wife feel safe,
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; whether it's financial, emotional,
[1:41:47] she can really be the wife that she
[1:41:48] desires to be,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Because you married a daughter of God,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; So ask her, "Honey, what is it you need
[1:41:58] of me? I know what it is my wife needs
[1:42:01] of me, and every day I have to choose.
[1:42:02] Do I want to do that or do I want to
[1:42:04] just be selfish? [snorts]
[1:42:07] But I like to think that I mostly make
[1:42:08] good decisions.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; What is the promised land for us today?
[1:42:14] Amen. It's the Holy Ghost. So in it is
[1:42:16] milk and honey.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; And when you're in it, life is
[1:42:18] exceedingly abundantly good.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring it down here to us.
[1:42:26] Now [snorts] this scripture when I was
[1:42:27] backsliden, Philippians 1:6,
[1:42:31] most of my Christian walk, this is what
[1:42:33] I was holding on to.
[1:42:36] being confident of this very thing,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; that he which hath begun a good work in
[1:42:42] you will perform it [snorts]
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; that got me through a lot of dark
[1:42:52] places.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; He will perform it. But what is So
[1:42:59] [snorts] I've always loved the scripture
[1:43:00] and I quite I never question but now my
[1:43:02] question is what is the good work?
[1:43:05] If you're going to have confidence, you
[1:43:07] got to know that he started a good work
[1:43:08] in you.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I believe the Bible and the message
[1:43:14] proves it and we'll look at some quotes
[1:43:16] that it's the fact that you have a
[1:43:18] thirst or a desire to serve him.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; That thirst will grow. Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:31] What do I got written here? It's begun.
[1:43:34] It's uh connected. Yeah. Good. Very
[1:43:37] good.
[1:43:40] Like I said many times, it got me to a
[1:43:43] lot. But this scripture now goes into
[1:43:46] Philippians 2:12-16. And this is really
[1:43:49] where I want to get to. I could preach
[1:43:51] probably 50 years honestly out of this
[1:43:54] scripture. This is how this is like my
[1:43:57] burning bush where God brought me. And
[1:44:00] this just keeps unfolding and unfolding
[1:44:01] and unfolding. This is through me all
[1:44:04] throughout the Bible. And I'm just
[1:44:05] amazed at how much like once I think I
[1:44:07] understand it just opens up more and
[1:44:08] more. Philippians [snorts] 2:12-16.
[1:44:11] Wherefore my beloved, I'm his beloved.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; As you have always obeyed, which means
[1:44:17] you listened intently, you heeded, you
[1:44:19] conformed, you hearkened, you were
[1:44:22] obedient. Not as in my presence only,
[1:44:25] but now much more in my absence. Work
[1:44:27] out your own salvation with fear and
[1:44:29] trembling.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; There's a work for you to do.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh, [snorts]
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; which means he's bringing about to cause
[1:44:38] a state to be
[1:44:40] to produce. It's God that workketh in
[1:44:43] you both to [snorts] will. Now I lived
[1:44:47] underneath just this portion for a long
[1:44:50] time. The will is that you have you
[1:44:52] desire, you want.
[1:44:55] [snorts] But like I said, I didn't have
[1:44:56] the ability to bring those desires to
[1:44:58] pass. And that's why I was so frustrated
[1:45:00] most of my adult life as a Christian,
[1:45:03] albeit a a backsliden one,
[1:45:07] because I hadn't surrendered all. But
[1:45:09] God in his love and his mercy
[1:45:11] showed me what I was lacking
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; to will and to do. [snorts]
[1:45:19] To do is the energy. It's the act of the
[1:45:23] ability, the force,
[1:45:26] the doing. It's the function. It's the
[1:45:27] Holy Spirit
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; of his good pleasure. There it is again.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose for you.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; And he started with a desire in your
[1:45:37] heart.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And he's been all along nudging,
[1:45:41] guiding, sending a word here
[1:45:44] to bring you to the point of where
[1:45:46] you'll surrender to his Holy Ghost. and
[1:45:49] then you and him can work together in
[1:45:50] unison.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer frustrated. I have the joy
[1:45:56] of the Lord.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I'm able to do the things that were
[1:46:00] always in my heart to do
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; because of this right here. Now, here's
[1:46:04] this is the same thing back there. It's
[1:46:06] the Holy Spirit. It's the promised land.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Do all things without murmurings and
[1:46:12] disputings. That's the rebellion.
[1:46:14] Because if you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:16] you know you have the power to do the
[1:46:18] things and you start murmuring,
[1:46:19] complaining, you're killing your
[1:46:20] testimony. You got a double tongue.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; It's either God or it's not. You've
[1:46:27] either surrendered all or you haven't.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; So if you know you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; only speak good things.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; It's the testimony of your mouth.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I had to learn that. There's times in my
[1:46:43] life where I just wanted to cut my
[1:46:45] tongue out because this is what got me
[1:46:46] in the most trouble in all my life is
[1:46:48] this right here.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I had a sharp tongue.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; My brothers and that, you know, they
[1:46:54] fought more with their fists. Well, I
[1:46:55] could cut somebody up and make them feel
[1:46:57] pretty small, real easy.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And they say words don't hurt. I'm
[1:47:01] telling you right now, I'd rather get
[1:47:02] punched in the face sometime. I'll
[1:47:04] recover real quick than to get cut up by
[1:47:06] someone I love.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; that you may be blameless and harmless,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; the sons of God,
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; without rebuke
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:47:19] nation.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Among whom you shine as the lights of
[1:47:22] the world.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; This to will and to do.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; If you surrender, then you'll become
[1:47:28] you'll live the word,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; It'll become so easy to you. You're
[1:47:31] going to fight, yes, but you'll know the
[1:47:33] recipe. You're just going to apply the
[1:47:35] word, humble yourself.
[1:47:39] All you have to do is feed your soul and
[1:47:42] starve this.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about the two dogs.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; See, we think we have to do everything
[1:47:52] by this
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; this this. It's not.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; It's by this
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; by this.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; It's by the word of God. Amen.
[1:48:04] [snorts]
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; If you got to work some, and I'm not
[1:48:06] knocking against it, but you'll get to
[1:48:08] the point where you understand that
[1:48:11] if you're doing something by the sweat
[1:48:12] of your brow, God will bless it. But if
[1:48:15] you have a desire to be there for your
[1:48:17] family, to be in your post of duty here,
[1:48:19] and you give God your best, and you
[1:48:21] still come here,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; God will bless you more than you can
[1:48:24] with your own muscles and your own
[1:48:25] effort.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's how God wants us to walk. Right.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Trusting on him.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; The message teaches there's a time
[1:48:36] coming where you won't even be able to
[1:48:38] provide with your own muscles. It's all
[1:48:39] going to be taken away from you.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; It's only your faith.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Holding forth the word of life.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; That's what we do when we go to work.
[1:48:49] When we drive the streets, we're holding
[1:48:51] for a lived life. You can go to work and
[1:48:54] talk all day about this, but if you
[1:48:56] don't live that before them, I'm in
[1:48:58] sales. People can smell a fake person a
[1:49:00] mile away.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; God has really blessed blessed me in
[1:49:06] [snorts] my efforts in sales and I break
[1:49:08] all the sales rules.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I go to just to genuinely help and surf.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a gift as a deacon. I don't
[1:49:17] know. But it sure helped me in sales.
[1:49:18] Just disconnect. Not being a selfish. I
[1:49:20] just had a customer on Friday. They
[1:49:22] wanted to spend $15,000. I'm like, "You
[1:49:24] don't need to do that. Just buy the
[1:49:26] $6,000 option. You can replace
[1:49:30] I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham couldn't even
[1:49:34] drive away with candy in his pocket. He
[1:49:36] had to go back. And
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; that's the same Holy Spirit.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; This mouth will only speak truth.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Most times when this mouth opened up, it
[1:49:49] just lies would spill out so easily. I
[1:49:52] didn't even know they were lies anymore.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:49:58] I won't give devil an inch.
[1:50:05] [snorts]
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, 25 minutes. I think we'll get
[1:50:07] there. Remember, there's a war here. I'm
[1:50:11] not I'm not denying that. But the war,
[1:50:13] if you're standing and you know you
[1:50:15] please God, you know, there's so many
[1:50:16] places in the Bible where Galatians, you
[1:50:19] don't have to go there. I'll just
[1:50:20] paraphrase. The flesh lust again, the
[1:50:22] flesh lusteth against the spirit and the
[1:50:24] spirit against the flesh. These are
[1:50:26] contrary one to the other.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Romans 7 19. The good that I would do
[1:50:32] not, but the evil which I do
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; that I do.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Frustrating. Very frustrating.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I lived there for so long. Watch
[1:50:42] [snorts] and pray. This is Matthew
[1:50:43] 26:41. Watch and pray. The spirit indeed
[1:50:45] is willing, but the flesh is weak.
[1:50:49] [snorts]
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible never hides the struggle. Paul
[1:50:52] confessed it openly. Jesus acknowledged
[1:50:55] it. The prophets lived it and we feel
[1:50:57] it.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; But there is a victory.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; There is a victory.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; There's a longing for God. There's a
[1:51:03] pull from the flesh.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; There's a desire to pray, a laziness of
[1:51:08] the body.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; The hunger is for the word, distraction
[1:51:11] of the world. These are all the
[1:51:12] realities. But make good choices.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Make good choices. Amen. [snorts]
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. Had right. We'll start. I just
[1:51:23] want to do some quotes on this thirst
[1:51:25] because it all begins with thirst.
[1:51:28] Now I didn't realize this but this is
[1:51:29] what brother uh what she said.
[1:51:33] This is from I have heard but now I see
[1:51:35] [snorts]
[1:51:36] paragraph 162 163. I said it's up to you
[1:51:39] to make your decision. I cannot make
[1:51:41] your decision. [snorts]
[1:51:45] She looked around the little woman all
[1:51:47] at once. She said, "Brother Brown, the
[1:51:49] greatest thing, the greatest, my
[1:51:51] greatest desire [snorts]
[1:51:53] in my heart is the salvation of my two
[1:51:55] boys."
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Remember, she could have a million
[1:51:59] dollars. She could. But her desire,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; she spoke it. God honored it. Amen.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; So, this word uh thirst, because thirst
[1:52:08] is desire, [snorts]
[1:52:11] I just want to run. I have a lot here.
[1:52:12] I'll just hit some of them because I
[1:52:14] don't think I'll have time to get to
[1:52:15] where I want to get.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Uh this is I mean if anything
[1:52:22] I spent almost all my time ended up
[1:52:24] being in the message thirst. I would
[1:52:26] advise you to go listen to it. I'm going
[1:52:28] to hit some of the point. I can't hit
[1:52:29] all the points that I want to but just
[1:52:31] listen to the message thirst and just
[1:52:32] ask the Lord to open it up to you. It's
[1:52:36] from 1965 0919 but it's a he preached
[1:52:39] thirst. He preached thirsting after
[1:52:41] life. It's the same type of message, but
[1:52:43] he really brings this home, especially
[1:52:45] for you young guys, understanding the
[1:52:47] desire of your heart and desire of the
[1:52:49] flesh. He really explains it and lays it
[1:52:51] all out.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Just because you stumble and fall in the
[1:52:55] desires of your flesh doesn't mean
[1:52:57] you're lost.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Satan's a liar.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; As long as you have a desire in your
[1:53:02] heart to serve God, you can always serve
[1:53:04] God.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Just pick yourself up,
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; make it right.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Even promise God you'll never do it
[1:53:10] again. and then you'll probably do it
[1:53:11] again [snorts]
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; because bro God said that all of our our
[1:53:17] words are lies
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; but God one day you'll fall maybe a
[1:53:20] million times but there has come a point
[1:53:22] where you'll stand up and you won't fall
[1:53:23] to it again
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; and then you'll have a true victory and
[1:53:27] you'll understand that I tried a million
[1:53:29] times
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; and I failed but this time I succeeded
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; that is the nature of a son and daughter
[1:53:37] of God
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; right
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; they'll get up get up I mean I would
[1:53:40] hate to be Satan. To see someone just
[1:53:43] hit you a million times and you just get
[1:53:45] right back up and stand. Can you imagine
[1:53:47] if just think about that in a boxing
[1:53:49] ring or something or you're beating
[1:53:50] someone up and they just always got back
[1:53:52] up and you could hit them with your best
[1:53:54] shot and you'll get right back up again.
[1:53:56] Just get up.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Just get back up and walk.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; That desire in you will. You won't be
[1:54:01] able to stay down. You won't.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, I'm going to start I'm
[1:54:05] going to hit some of the points here,
[1:54:06] but from like paragraph 25 all the way
[1:54:09] over to 217 in the message thirst. So, I
[1:54:12] just want to hit some of this.
[1:54:14] Uh, I might go so quick that you guys
[1:54:16] might not be able to pull it up.
[1:54:18] Paragraph 25. Then I was looking and
[1:54:20] thinking about the word thirst, which is
[1:54:23] desire. So, I looked up the dictionary
[1:54:25] to see what it means. And here it is
[1:54:26] what Webster says. It's a painful
[1:54:28] desire.
[1:54:30] painful when you want something so bad
[1:54:32] until it becomes painful to you.
[1:54:36] [snorts]
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; 26 God gave God has given us that he
[1:54:40] would do give us a desire for something.
[1:54:43] [snorts] He's given you a control tower,
[1:54:46] something that sets inside of you that
[1:54:48] controls these different desires. And
[1:54:51] this thirst, this control tower that
[1:54:53] sets in a man's heart is something that
[1:54:54] God give him to warn him of desires
[1:54:58] that's needful for him. So if you're
[1:55:00] desiring something, you need it.
[1:55:02] Remember he talked about the kid with
[1:55:03] the eating the I think it was the
[1:55:06] erasers on the pencils or the p uh the
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; pedal on a
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; even mothers when they're pregnant will
[1:55:17] needs it.
[1:55:20] desiring the Holy Spirit. So if you're
[1:55:21] desiring the Holy Spirit, it means you
[1:55:23] need it.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why you have a desire for it.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; I desired, like I've said this many a
[1:55:28] times,
[1:55:31] but how God brought me back
[1:55:35] was I had a desire to be a good husband
[1:55:36] and a father.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And for three and a half years, I tried
[1:55:41] and I thought I was, but my wife's
[1:55:43] testimony was, "No, you're not."
[1:55:47] So, we did counseling with the pastor
[1:55:49] and the pastor's wife. Best decision we
[1:55:51] I ever made. And it was hard. The
[1:55:53] thoughts that went through my mind,
[1:55:56] how could this be? But I sat through it
[1:56:00] and it hurt.
[1:56:02] But I'm sitting there with three people
[1:56:04] that I know and I trust and I love and I
[1:56:06] know they have the Holy Spirit and
[1:56:07] they're telling me there's something off
[1:56:08] in your life.
[1:56:13] Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; I look at it as a private interview. If
[1:56:18] the prophet was in the land today,
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; we would all be lined up
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; and he would discern. I'm telling you
[1:56:25] right now, the gift of the pastor is no
[1:56:27] different.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; It's not Barry and Lisa. There's a gift
[1:56:31] of ministry and the Holy Ghost will
[1:56:33] honor it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; If you're lacking something in your
[1:56:36] life, you can't overcome it, have a
[1:56:37] private interview. Come on people.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; We're brothers and sisters.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; We're family. We're all here for one
[1:56:44] another.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Put the put the man aside.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Feed that inner man.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That's how I overcome. That's a part of
[1:56:52] it. I had a desire I couldn't
[1:56:53] understand. And then through the gift of
[1:56:55] a pastor.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I heard something that I didn't want to
[1:56:59] hear.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; But that desire in me was stronger than
[1:57:04] my pride.
[1:57:05] I was willing to walk through it and it
[1:57:07] circumcised it away from me.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; It was painful. Yes. But the joy that I
[1:57:14] now get to live,
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; brother, it was worth it.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; I've had a terrible life, I'd say. But
[1:57:20] you know what? I wouldn't change a thing
[1:57:21] now because it got me to where I am
[1:57:23] today.
[1:57:27] [applause]
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; You told me five, six years ago I'd be
[1:57:32] standing here talking about I'd be like,
[1:57:33] "You're nuts.
[1:57:35] It's [snorts] by the Holy Spirit that I
[1:57:37] can do this. Amen. And I understand now
[1:57:39] all the little things that I went
[1:57:40] through. I used to want to hide them.
[1:57:42] Now I'll talk about them because that's
[1:57:43] how I defeat Satan with them because he
[1:57:45] has no when I can go and openly talk
[1:57:47] about my failures and my faults and I
[1:57:49] overcome. Satan loses all power of it.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God. You
[1:57:53] have faults and you have failures. Don't
[1:57:54] be afraid to talk about because that's
[1:57:56] how you'll be truly free from it.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:58:03] talks about desires in there. He talks
[1:58:05] about physical and spiritual, but then
[1:58:07] he talks about he goes to Psalms where
[1:58:08] David says, "My heart, you know, my soul
[1:58:10] thirsts after the living God." And
[1:58:11] that's what you have to find. Not just
[1:58:12] the word, it's the living word. Come
[1:58:15] face to face with him. [snorts]
[1:58:18] Happened some years ago, tale that
[1:58:19] someone told me. Uh, but for the living
[1:58:22] God, a God that's ever present, and his
[1:58:24] soul thirsted. He's talking about David.
[1:58:25] For that God, not for some historical
[1:58:28] thing. Amen. Uh, 29. And now the control
[1:58:31] tower in you is what directs you and
[1:58:35] tells you what you have need of
[1:58:37] spiritually speaking. And [snorts] it's
[1:58:38] brought and I'm just skipping down
[1:58:40] through what I've highlighted. I'm
[1:58:41] sorry. It's the only way I can get
[1:58:43] through it. And it's brought to you by
[1:58:46] thirst. And there's a control tower in
[1:58:48] your soul that tells [snorts] you the
[1:58:50] spiritual things that you have need of
[1:58:52] or something in your spirit. And you by
[1:58:54] this can tell what kind of life is
[1:58:56] controlling you.
[1:58:58] So this is a
[1:59:00] what is your desire of your heart, your
[1:59:03] soul.
[1:59:05] He's telling you by those desires, you
[1:59:07] can discern whether or not you have the
[1:59:09] Holy Ghost.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; When you can see what your desires are,
[1:59:15] then you can tell by that what kind of
[1:59:17] something that's in you that's creating
[1:59:19] this desire that you have. See, there's
[1:59:21] a certain thing that you thirst for, and
[1:59:24] it can tell you what your you in your
[1:59:27] soul what this desire is, the nature of
[1:59:29] the thirsts that you have. I hope that
[1:59:32] you can understand that. Amen.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; See, even though I fell to my flesh,
[1:59:37] that my desire was always to serve God.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; I just didn't have the ability.
[1:59:46] God didn't put me on a hospital with
[1:59:48] cancer, but I had spiritual cancer
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; and I've been completely healed from it.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; You can't see it other people because
[1:59:56] there I've had
[1:59:58] in the last year, I've spoken to more
[2:00:00] people about God and where I go to
[2:00:04] church than I have my entire life. Not
[2:00:06] even they ask me because there's an
[2:00:08] atmosphere I bring with me.
[2:00:11] I've even seen people in their homes
[2:00:13] just lay out their whole lives and
[2:00:15] they're like, "Man, I've never told I
[2:00:16] know what it is, but it's just a
[2:00:17] reassurance for me." They're like, "I've
[2:00:19] never told anyone this."
[2:00:22] People say, "You just seem so
[2:00:23] trustworthy. I just feel at ease and
[2:00:25] peace with you."
[2:00:30] I've had some very important people in
[2:00:32] my life, people that know me my whole
[2:00:33] life, and in the last year said,
[2:00:36] "Donald, I don't recognize you.
[2:00:40] Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You're not the same man.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; There's a noticeable difference. Even if
[2:00:47] you were born and raised in this
[2:00:49] message, there's a noticeable
[2:00:50] difference.
[2:00:54] [snorts]
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Each tower is a warning caller for the
[2:00:58] needs of the other. Each one calls to
[2:01:00] the need for what the caller is calling
[2:01:02] for. It sends out a wave of warning.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; So, there's a war, right? For instance,
[2:01:07] the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires
[2:01:09] that's in the body and the spirit
[2:01:10] desires the things that's in the soul.
[2:01:13] Desire is and many times these war one
[2:01:15] against the other. We find there that
[2:01:17] that's a great trouble today. Too many
[2:01:19] people try to live between these two
[2:01:22] desires.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; For one of them desires the [snorts]
[2:01:26] things of the earth, the other desires
[2:01:28] the things of heaven.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; That was me.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That [snorts] was me. I lived that. If
[2:01:36] he's talking about anyone, that's me.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I chose my place came where like
[2:01:43] the rich young ruler and I had to
[2:01:44] choose. It was life or death.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about uh you go read them. I
[2:01:51] I have so many here. It'll talk about
[2:01:53] that that desire in you will actually
[2:01:56] vindicate to you who you are.
[2:01:59] the thirst. Uh he talks about Isaiah and
[2:02:02] he had that thirst and that's when he
[2:02:03] realized I'm a man of unclean lips and
[2:02:05] uh he talks so well about it better than
[2:02:07] I ever could. Obviously I'm just paring
[2:02:09] the prophet but with a revelation and
[2:02:11] experience in my own life. It's not just
[2:02:13] words. I I I lived it. I see the life
[2:02:16] behind it. [snorts] He talks about it's
[2:02:18] God himself in you. It's a satisfying
[2:02:20] portion is what he brings to. And that's
[2:02:22] what I'm trying to express is that all
[2:02:24] my frustrations are gone now. Now I have
[2:02:26] the joy of the Lord. Truly I can stand
[2:02:28] here and say it all I want but others
[2:02:30] can say that's true. The [snorts] Holy
[2:02:32] Ghost satisfies every fiber of your
[2:02:34] soul. He actually talks about amen. He
[2:02:36] says until the Holy Spirit itself is
[2:02:38] bubbling in you. Amen. Even if you don't
[2:02:41] have that and I'm speaking about is
[2:02:42] creating a desire in you then that's a
[2:02:44] godly desire. [snorts] He talks about be
[2:02:47] able to discern by desire. The Holy
[2:02:50] Spirit he only he talks about having
[2:02:53] this thirst. You can either try and
[2:02:54] satisfy it with something else
[2:02:57] or you can actually not try and sat and
[2:02:59] it'll die. So he talks about trying to
[2:03:01] feed it something and he talks about the
[2:03:03] Holy Spirit will only feed on the word
[2:03:05] and you can't even you try and feed it
[2:03:07] something it knows. He says so that's
[2:03:08] why once you you always want to be just
[2:03:10] walking in the word because that's the
[2:03:12] only thing that's going to satisfy you
[2:03:13] now right 100% the word. Uh he goes if
[2:03:17] not you'll spiritually die and that's
[2:03:18] what happened to the rich young ruler.
[2:03:20] He did all these good things,
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; but brother Ram says that it never
[2:03:24] really counted much because he missed
[2:03:26] out on this chance of eternal life,
[2:03:28] right? [snorts]
[2:03:30] He says, "You will die." He actually in
[2:03:31] here talks about a Bible hitchhiker that
[2:03:33] you just pick the the word that you, you
[2:03:35] know, is comfortable for you and easy
[2:03:36] for you to live and you skip over. And
[2:03:38] he calls him a Bible hitchhiker.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't try and feed it the
[2:03:41] wrong thing." He goes, "You've got to uh
[2:03:44] belong to Christ."
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to give into that desire.
[2:03:47] [snorts]
[2:03:49] Then he talks about fellowship, walking
[2:03:51] with God through fellowship. So that's
[2:03:54] Amen. Like I said, I've got so many
[2:03:56] here. Uh then he talks about the dove
[2:03:58] and the dove's diet,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; right? And it can't eat these other
[2:04:02] things. It'll kill it,
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; right? So that's why when you get the
[2:04:04] Holy Spirit, you only start feeding on
[2:04:06] good things. Then he talks about the
[2:04:08] deep call to the deep. It takes it takes
[2:04:11] more, right? It takes something to
[2:04:12] satisfy inside of you that pours down
[2:04:14] from God into the soul. The deep callth
[2:04:16] to the deep at the noise of thy water
[2:04:18] spouts, oh Lord, the deep calling to the
[2:04:20] deep. Then he he ends it with, "What
[2:04:23] kind of thirst could we think was in us
[2:04:25] tonight?" We as Pentecostal people or
[2:04:28] message believers, where are we getting
[2:04:30] to? So, [snorts] excuse me.
[2:04:40] [snorts]
[2:04:41] What kind of a thirst is in us? What
[2:04:43] kind of a a thirst is in me? What kind
[2:04:45] of a thirst is you? Don't try to hush
[2:04:47] that holy thirst of God.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have that thirst, count
[2:04:52] yourself very blessed.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; So I want to talk about this and and the
[2:04:58] pastor has been preaching on this. It
[2:05:01] was actually at a lasia church age and
[2:05:03] it's about overcoming. So I was trying
[2:05:05] to show that a thirst is good and then
[2:05:08] it brings you to the Holy Ghost and
[2:05:09] that's very good. But now there's an
[2:05:12] exceedingly abundantly good where God
[2:05:14] when you start working in unison with
[2:05:16] the Holy Ghost. You're a helpmate to the
[2:05:17] Holy Ghost.
[2:05:19] You're going to be like Joseph.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; It might not be in the material things,
[2:05:23] but spiritually speaking, even in this
[2:05:25] world, because God will give you the
[2:05:27] resources that you need to be able to
[2:05:29] fulfill your purpose.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; And it's it's so good now to be able to
[2:05:34] live and move with purpose in my life.
[2:05:36] And it's not a purpose in a fleshly way.
[2:05:39] It's a purpose
[2:05:41] that was born to be.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's a purpose to be a father according
[2:05:45] to the word of God, a husband,
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; a worker.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; My desire is that one day, what's
[2:05:52] happening at my work right now is
[2:05:53] amazing. My desire is one day my manager
[2:05:56] or the owner comes to me, he's like,
[2:05:57] "What are you doing? How are you getting
[2:05:59] these results?" I want to be able to
[2:06:00] stand there and say, "I'm simply
[2:06:02] following the teachings of the Bible and
[2:06:04] a vindicated prophet. I'm applying it to
[2:06:07] my life and you get the benefit from it.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is my desire.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Later to see a church age. Now what are
[2:06:15] we over what are we to overcome?
[2:06:19] That is the normal question to ask here.
[2:06:21] But that is not the actual thought of
[2:06:23] this verse for it is not so much what we
[2:06:26] have we are to overcome but how we are
[2:06:29] to overcome. Now this is logical for
[2:06:32] does it matter much what we are to
[2:06:34] overcome as long as we know how we can
[2:06:37] overcome.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; And then he said in Matthew 4 I'm just
[2:06:42] going to skip down wherein Jesus is
[2:06:43] tempted of the devil. He co overcome the
[2:06:46] personal temptation of Satan by the
[2:06:47] [clears throat] word and by the word
[2:06:49] only.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; This is the voice of a vindicated
[2:06:53] prophet.
[2:06:54] You can try it any other way you want,
[2:06:57] but it's only by making word-based
[2:06:59] decisions,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; applying it to your life.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to skip down, but Jesus
[2:07:04] overcame by the word.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say this that this
[2:07:08] is the only way to be an overcomer. Also
[2:07:11] is the only way that you can know
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; if you are overcoming because that word
[2:07:17] can't fail.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. And if he begun
[2:07:19] a good work in you,
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; that word can't fail.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; But you have to choose to die out to
[2:07:26] yourself.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; And that good work, let it start to
[2:07:29] manifest, start working with.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Now, this is as clear as it gets. Notice
[2:07:34] now again how Jesus overcame the world
[2:07:37] systems of religion when he was
[2:07:38] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[2:07:40] of his day. He constantly
[2:07:43] applied the word.
[2:07:48] simple but not always easy
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; because this man is in total opposition
[2:07:54] to that.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to go into how can I
[2:07:58] overcome?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yep. I think uh we'll be just in time.
[2:08:04] This is from uh let me see here. Yeah.
[2:08:08] 19 63825 in the morning. How can I
[2:08:12] overcome? Jesus told us how to do it. He
[2:08:15] overcome means overcome means to stand
[2:08:17] the test.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Like all the old saints
[2:08:21] did. Like Jesus did. Amidst all of his
[2:08:23] enemies, he stood the test. Everything
[2:08:25] he was tested against, he stood it. In
[2:08:28] the very face of sickness, him being
[2:08:30] Messiah, he healed them. In the face of
[2:08:33] death, he brought remember the same life
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; that was in him
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; has to be in you.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Brought back. In the face of Calvary,
[2:08:42] his own death, he defeated it by
[2:08:44] surrendering himself.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Why? By the word said, you destroy this
[2:08:48] temple and I'll write raise it up in
[2:08:51] three days. The word said so. See,
[2:08:53] you're putting your faith in this word,
[2:08:57] not in your ability or your
[2:08:58] interpretation.
[2:09:00] It's by the word.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Why? But sorry. All by the word and
[2:09:06] humility. Oh my. There's a real man.
[2:09:09] There's the one to make your example.
[2:09:11] See, he defeated everything. Overcome
[2:09:13] it. 105. Overcome means to recognize the
[2:09:17] devil in every one of his tricks.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; This man, this man. Okay, that's some
[2:09:24] I'll tell you right now, once you get
[2:09:26] control of this guy, all of a sudden,
[2:09:27] he'll start using outside forces because
[2:09:29] he can't get you this way anymore.
[2:09:34] A lot of people says there is no devil.
[2:09:36] It's just a thought. Don't you believe
[2:09:38] that? There's a real devil.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; He's just as real as you and I are to or
[2:09:42] anybody. A real devil that you must
[2:09:45] recognize him real.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; You must know that he's a devil.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Then the same time you recognize him and
[2:09:53] know that he's a devil and he's against
[2:09:55] you.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Then to overcome, you must recognize
[2:09:57] that the God in you
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; is greater and mightier
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; than he is.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's the one that's in you
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; has already overcome. Amen.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; This is why in the Bible it says Abraham
[2:10:11] at 99 met God. He knew he could drive
[2:10:13] down a stake and say, "Listen, I I had
[2:10:15] my encounter and I chose life." Noah was
[2:10:19] God met him. It says that he walked with
[2:10:21] God. He chose life.
[2:10:25] And by his grace, you are more than a
[2:10:27] match for him.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; See, not you by yourself, you with the
[2:10:32] Holy Ghost.
[2:10:36] exceedingly abundantly working together.
[2:10:39] There's a real overcomering overcoming
[2:10:41] when you recognize.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; See, yes, we are a sinner saved by
[2:10:46] grace.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; But I'm also a son and daughter of God
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; who's died out to himself
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; and allowing the Holy Ghost to bring to
[2:10:56] pass the purpose that I was born here
[2:10:59] for.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't let your testimony only
[2:11:03] be never forget that yes, you're a
[2:11:05] sinner side by grace, but you're here
[2:11:07] for a purpose.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; It's to fulfill the word of God to
[2:11:10] overcome
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is he's already
[2:11:13] done it
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; in Revel. Okay, if we're to reflect the
[2:11:18] word of God, what is the last major
[2:11:20] event that Jesus did? He descended with
[2:11:22] the open book
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; and put his feet on the earth. He took
[2:11:26] all things under control.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; So if he's in you,
[2:11:31] What are you going to reflect?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to be able to overcome all
[2:11:36] these things because he's already done
[2:11:37] it.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; You look back and say, "I'm doing this
[2:11:43] and I'm doing that." Then no, you're
[2:11:45] defeated.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; But there's no condemnation to them
[2:11:48] which are in Christ Jesus, that walk not
[2:11:50] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Then you realize that you've overcome.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Remember, he said that you went to
[2:11:56] Calvary with them, you died with them,
[2:11:58] you you raised with them.
[2:12:00] Don't let that just be a theological
[2:12:03] message truth.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Let it be reality in your life.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; He says just walk in it. Just choose it.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Satan has no control.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; None. He's defeated. He when Jesus died
[2:12:15] on the cross, and I'm saying this now,
[2:12:17] and I've said it for many time, but now
[2:12:19] I I say it with revelation
[2:12:22] that it's done. You just have to die to
[2:12:24] yourself now and enjoy the benefits of
[2:12:26] it.
[2:12:27] Lord,
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; but there's no condemnation to them
[2:12:31] which are in Christ Jesus that walk not
[2:12:32] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[2:12:34] Then you realize that you've overcome.
[2:12:37] Talking about walking,
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; right? Walking with God.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; And you know that he is a devil. You
[2:12:43] can't say, "I got a sickness and I I
[2:12:45] don't believe it's a sickness." See,
[2:12:46] he's not about whistling by the
[2:12:47] graveyard and saying that, "Oh, yes,
[2:12:49] it's a sickness." You got cancer. Yeah.
[2:12:51] Don't believe it's Don't believe it's a
[2:12:53] cancer. It's a cancer.
[2:12:56] It is a cancer. But remember, greater is
[2:12:59] he that is in you
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; You must realize that the Holy Spirit
[2:13:05] that's in you has already overcome this
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; thing. And he's in you
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; and you can overcome by him. That's
[2:13:12] exactly sensible.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way the scriptures
[2:13:16] written,
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; overcoming.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Iius said, I don't even think I've read
[2:13:21] it before, but that's okay. For the
[2:13:23] glory of God is the living man, [snorts]
[2:13:27] and the life of man consists in
[2:13:29] beholding God. That's that to mahood.
[2:13:33] For the glory of God is in the living
[2:13:36] man
[2:13:39] shall live by every word that proceedth.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; And the life of man consists in
[2:13:46] beholding. So once you know you've
[2:13:48] beholding God, you can truly live. Amen.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come. Sorry
[2:13:55] [snorts] that was what's on my heart.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; I don't have the best of way and ability
[2:14:01] of explain it, but this is how the Lord
[2:14:03] has moved on me.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; I have two closings here. I'm going to
[2:14:17] choose one and I'll get you to go read
[2:14:19] the other. to scriptures. I'm going to
[2:14:22] read Ephesians 3:14-21 as to sum all
[2:14:25] this up. Everything you'll see now
[2:14:27] comes. I only found this this morning,
[2:14:29] this scripture.
[2:14:32] The other one is Isaiah 58:1-14. Go read
[2:14:35] it because it's about when the Jews,
[2:14:39] they were serving God. They were fasting
[2:14:41] and keeping the Sabbath, but they
[2:14:42] weren't they weren't doing it in the joy
[2:14:43] and love of serving God. They were doing
[2:14:45] it for their own pro. and go read the
[2:14:48] promise that he gives them if they'll
[2:14:50] return from he says do it in a loving
[2:14:52] way. This is what this message is about.
[2:14:54] If you don't love coming to church and
[2:14:56] worshiping God, if you don't love
[2:14:58] serving God,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; there's something wrong.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; It's not g commandments aren't
[2:15:04] grievious.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; If you're in love with him, it becomes
[2:15:08] your pleasure and his pleasure.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know how much more simpler I can
[2:15:14] say that. But I'll tell you this. If you
[2:15:16] don't have that love, but you have a
[2:15:18] desire, if you want to get there,
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; it's hard, but it's simple.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Die out to yourself.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; And if you won't, God will bring you to
[2:15:28] a point where you you'll have to choose.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; I didn't read it. I meant to. The rich
[2:15:32] young ruler, he he had come to that
[2:15:35] point. And he was grieved
[2:15:38] at the word of God. The very thing that
[2:15:40] he was lacking, God told him in love,
[2:15:43] it'll either set you free or it'll at
[2:15:46] that point condemn you [music] to death.
[2:15:49] Everyone has in that thirst. He's
[2:15:51] talking about that desire, that thirst
[2:15:53] will always bring you to [music] that
[2:15:55] opportunity where you come face to face
[2:15:57] with God.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; And then you have to choose life or
[2:16:02] death.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; For some people it might have been one
[2:16:06] year. Some people it might be 40 or 50
[2:16:10] but you'll come to that [music]
[2:16:12] crossroad if you want to say amen.
[2:16:14] Ephesians 3:14-21
[2:16:17] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[2:16:19] father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:22] of whom the whole family
[2:16:25] in heaven and earth is named.
[2:16:28] You have to be married to that name
[2:16:31] that he would grant you according to the
[2:16:33] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[2:16:35] with might or power, the Holy Ghost by
[2:16:38] his spirit in the inner man. This man
[2:16:40] now has to step back and let that son of
[2:16:43] God truly come forth and manifest.
[2:16:46] That Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[2:16:48] faith, that ye being rooted and grounded
[2:16:51] in love may be able to comprehend with
[2:16:54] all saints
[2:16:56] what is the breadth, the length, the
[2:16:59] depth, and the height.
[2:17:02] It's not measurable, folks. It's
[2:17:05] all-encompassing.
[2:17:08] I don't know if that's he's talking
[2:17:10] about the city, but I just know that you
[2:17:13] can't exhaust God's love
[2:17:17] and to know the love of Christ which
[2:17:18] passes knowledge, the understanding of
[2:17:21] the message or the Bible if you want to
[2:17:22] say that you might be filled with all
[2:17:25] the fullness of God.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Now fullness is full but he's saying all
[2:17:29] the fullness exceedingly abundantly
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; more. It even comes down here, but over
[2:17:35] and over again, this is what he's trying
[2:17:36] to get to you. Give me your best.
[2:17:40] And I'll take it and multiply it.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; That is true strength. It's in humility.
[2:17:49] And to know the love of Christ, which
[2:17:51] paths knowledge, that ye might be filled
[2:17:53] with all the fullness of God. Now onto
[2:17:55] him that is able to exceedingly
[2:17:58] abundantly mahood mahood above all that
[2:18:01] we ask or think.
[2:18:04] See when we think we want this and that
[2:18:06] then you get there and you're like it
[2:18:09] expands. Oh I can more more. Same thing
[2:18:11] like you might desire I wish I made
[2:18:13] $100,000. You get there $100,000 seems
[2:18:15] like much anymore. Oh I want 250,000.
[2:18:19] You get there and then your mind expands
[2:18:21] and it's the way the word of God is.
[2:18:24] When you start walking in that light,
[2:18:26] you're like, "Well, how far can [music]
[2:18:28] this really go?"
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; It'll change your body. That's how far
[2:18:31] it'll go.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Now, onto him that is able to do
[2:18:36] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[2:18:38] ask or think, according to the power
[2:18:41] that workketh in us. Remember back in
[2:18:43] Philippians, he workketh in us [music]
[2:18:44] to will and to do. Amen. Unto him be the
[2:18:48] glory in the church of Jesus Christ or
[2:18:50] Christ Jesus throughout all ages, with
[2:18:53] world without end. Amen.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Our testimony and I believe yours is
[2:18:58] too. All that I am is because of the
[2:19:01] grace of God.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; If I see any good in you, I know it's
[2:19:06] Jesus Christ.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; If you see any good in me,
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; please know that it's Jesus Christ.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's no good thing in this flesh.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; I might be able to, you know, give you a
[2:19:17] good meal, give you a little bit of
[2:19:18] money, and maybe a little bit,
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; but I know living waters flows out of me
[2:19:22] now. Amen.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Wherever I go,
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; I understand it's an opportunity now to
[2:19:29] impart eternal life.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; There was a time when I'd be in a
[2:19:32] restaurant and I'd pray and I'd do it as
[2:19:35] quickly and as quiet. I'm not ashamed
[2:19:37] anymore.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; I go into so many homes now, everyone is
[2:19:44] hungering for what you have.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that. Don't be
[2:19:48] ashamed and embarrassed.
[2:19:50] They're hungering for what you have.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; They might have satisfied it with
[2:19:54] something else, but they're desiring for
[2:19:57] what you have.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; So, don't be ashamed of it.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Walk proudly and humbly.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. Let's stand together
[2:20:06] and uh have a word of prayer. Brother
[2:20:08] Emanuel, if you want to come shortly.
[2:20:16] Heavenly Father, Lord, [music]
[2:20:18] thank you for this day and this
[2:20:20] opportunity, Lord, to get to know you a
[2:20:23] little more, Father, to express our love
[2:20:25] and our appreciation to you, Father.
[2:20:27] Lord,
[2:20:28] Father, we thank you for the desire that
[2:20:30] you placed in our heart, Father, Lord,
[2:20:32] and we thank you for watching over that
[2:20:33] word, Lord. We truly are your
[2:20:34] workmanship. It's all you, Father. We
[2:20:38] just learn to to bend the knee, to bow
[2:20:41] in humility, Father, and allow you to do
[2:20:42] that which you have purposed, Lord. We
[2:20:45] thank you, Lord. Lord, we have no other
[2:20:46] words, Father. We [music] can't express
[2:20:48] the gratitude in our hearts, Father.
[2:20:49] Lord, we just desire to work, walk
[2:20:52] perfectly before you, Lord, and with
[2:20:54] you, [music] Father, to invite you into
[2:20:55] every avenue of our life, Father. Not
[2:20:57] one corner of our lives
[2:21:00] left where you can't walk in freely and
[2:21:02] just enjoy yourself, Father. Lord, we
[2:21:05] grant you our mouth, our minds, our
[2:21:08] hands, our feet. Father, our toll
[2:21:10] beating being. Lord, thou knowest our
[2:21:13] heart. Father, we're so thankful because
[2:21:14] we don't have the words to express it,
[2:21:16] Lord. Father, I ask that you just be
[2:21:18] with each believer. I don't know where
[2:21:19] they're at in their journey, Father, but
[2:21:21] Lord, if they're sitting here today with
[2:21:22] the desire to serve you, I know the
[2:21:24] final destination, Lord. Your word
[2:21:27] declares it, and we accept it, Father.
[2:21:29] Lord, go us as we go. Father, may we
[2:21:32] just not leave you at the door.
[2:21:34] May you go to work with us, Father. Your
[2:21:37] prophet told us that maybe you're just
[2:21:39] called to be a housewife, but be the
[2:21:40] best housewife you can be. you might be
[2:21:42] called to be a farmer, but be the best
[2:21:44] farmer [music] that you can be by the
[2:21:46] Holy Spirit.
[2:21:48] And Father, forgive us when we have
[2:21:50] murmured and complained. Lord, we tell
[2:21:53] you, Lord, we won't do it again.
[2:21:56] That's our vow to you, Father. Lord, you
[2:21:58] are good.
[2:22:00] You fulfill us, Lord. You satisfy us.
[2:22:03] You are more than enough, Father. Lord,
[2:22:05] thank you, Lord, for your your love and
[2:22:07] your mercy and your grace. In Jesus
[2:22:09] Christ's name we commit ourselves aresh.
[2:22:12] Grant us traveling mercies. Lord bring
[2:22:13] the pastor back safe. We pray in Jesus
[2:22:16] Christ's name. [music] Amen.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Emanuel. What song?
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Sing it. Amen. Come on, brother.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.
[2:22:45] [music]
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:22:59] [music]
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; All the world [singing]
[2:23:01] today
[2:23:07] no [singing and music] other.
[2:23:11] Jesus is the [music] way.
[2:23:17] Amen.
[2:23:19] Thank you, brother Don, for yielding
[2:23:21] yourself.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you richly. Were you
[2:23:25] fed this morning?
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the name of the Lord.
[2:23:31] [applause]
[2:23:35] You know, I was sitting down. I was
[2:23:38] standing out at the back and I was
[2:23:40] thinking
[2:23:42] how God must love himself.
[2:23:46] you know that he he he created all these
[2:23:51] things the mountains and valleys and
[2:23:55] wonderful lady bones and birds and
[2:23:57] everything but they were all good. You
[2:24:01] know when he said it was very good when
[2:24:03] he created something else that reflected
[2:24:05] his own attributes
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; that was man that was you and I. And it
[2:24:11] never stopped there
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; because he loves the manifestation of
[2:24:15] his spirit in flesh.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; He loves the manifestation of his
[2:24:18] attributes. When he sees it, he cannot
[2:24:20] avoid it.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; And because it was only after man was
[2:24:25] created that fellowship started.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Now when that same spirit manifested
[2:24:32] again in the Lord Jesus Christ, what did
[2:24:34] it happen? Says, "This is my beloved son
[2:24:36] in which I'm well pleased." And I
[2:24:39] believe that if that spirit gets into
[2:24:41] any flesh, God will be pleased. Praise
[2:24:45] the name of the Lord. And I believe that
[2:24:47] is what God is looking for. And that is
[2:24:50] why if you if you watch clearly, he's
[2:24:53] given us everything we need to dress up
[2:24:56] and look good for him.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Everything is in the word. Everything is
[2:25:00] in the message. I believe [music] the
[2:25:02] challenge is are we willing to take it
[2:25:05] only that or do we want to add one thing
[2:25:08] here one thing there and if you are
[2:25:11] tempted ever think of Queen
[2:25:14] praise the name of the Lord
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; blessing at Calvary just realize I was
[2:25:21] talking to you
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:25:29] I spent in vanity
[2:25:32] [singing] and pride.
