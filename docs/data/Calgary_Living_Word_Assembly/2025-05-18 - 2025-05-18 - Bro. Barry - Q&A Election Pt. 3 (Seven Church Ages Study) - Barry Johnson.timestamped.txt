[19:35] Beautiful message of you. Welcome once
[19:38] again in the house of the Lord. Each one
[19:39] of you going to have lunch on a
[19:41] Wednesday night. A little bit of a
[19:43] different weather pattern, but we're
[19:45] thankful that we're going to drive
[19:46] places to fellowship and worship in
[19:48] tonight.
[19:49] Many people around the world, saints of
[19:52] like precious faith that have less.
[19:54] We're just thankful to the Lord for what
[19:55] he's provided. May the Lord bless you
[19:58] for your attendance this evening. I know
[20:00] that you're going to be blessed because
[20:01] you came. His word promised you be
[20:04] blessed. Good to have you back. You've
[20:06] been under the weather for a while. Good
[20:07] to have you back. Each one of you stand
[20:09] with me if you would as we sing this
[20:11] course. This a psalm is actually
[20:14] sprinkled through the scripture. I think
[20:16] three different scriptures mention this,
[20:17] but great is the Lord and greatly to be
[20:21] praised. Well, great is the
[20:24] Lord and greatly to be
[20:28] praised in the city of our God. In the
[20:33] mountain of his
[20:36] holiness, beautiful situation.
[20:40] The joy of the whole
[20:43] earth. His mouth side in the sides of
[20:46] the north. The city of the great
[20:50] king. His mouth side on the sides of the
[20:54] north. The city of the great king. Oh,
[20:58] great is the Lord and greatly to be
[21:04] praised. In the city of our God, in the
[21:09] mountain of his
[21:12] holiness, beautiful
[21:15] preituation, the joy of the whole
[21:19] earth. Is Mount Zion on the sides of the
[21:22] north, the city of the great
[21:26] king. Is Mount Zion on the sides of the
[21:30] north, the city of the great king.
[21:35] Let's give
[21:37] thanks with a grateful heart. Give
[21:43] thanks to the holy one. Give
[21:50] thanks because he's
[21:52] given Jesus
[21:56] Christ his son.
[22:00] Oh, give
[22:03] thanks with the grateful heart. Give
[22:09] thanks to the holy one. Give
[22:15] thanks because he's
[22:18] given Jesus
[22:22] Christ his son.
[22:26] away
[22:28] now. Let the weak say I am
[22:35] strong. Let the poor say I am
[22:41] rich because of what the Lord has
[22:48] done for us.
[22:54] away. Let the sick say I am
[23:00] here. Let the B say
[23:04] [Music]
[23:07] I because of what the Lord has
[23:13] done for us.
[23:20] It all is
[23:25] well. Oh, all is
[23:30] well. Thank you, Lord. Oh, we have
[23:35] heard the message of the Lord and all is
[23:40] well.
[23:45] Oh yes, there is a place of
[23:51] perfect rest is
[23:54] behind the inner
[23:58] world. So
[24:01] [Music]
[24:04] rest for all is sing together.
[24:10] Oh yes, all is
[24:16] well. Oh yes,

[24:36] Oh yes, there is a place of
[24:42] perfect rest. It's
[24:45] behind the
[24:49] earth. Oh, rest.
[24:54] [Music]
[25:12] Good evening saints. God bless you all.
[25:15] Let's just come to the Lord in prayer.
[25:19] Lord, we can sing with confidence that
[25:22] all is well. Jesus, the Lord, it's not
[25:26] because of anything of ourselves, was
[25:28] everything that you provide for us.
[25:31] our life, our health,
[25:33] salvation, for our families, for our
[25:37] children, Lord Jesus, those that Lord we
[25:39] love so much. And it's only that love,
[25:42] Lord Jesus, that you've just projected
[25:45] to us that we want to be able to reflect
[25:47] back to others to see, Lord Jesus. We
[25:50] don't want to be selfish and just take
[25:51] it for ourselves, but may let others be
[25:54] able to just see that life of Christ in
[25:57] us and the attributes that goes with
[25:59] that, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord God, we just
[26:03] thank you Lord for this time that we can
[26:05] share in the service tonight. The Lord
[26:07] that we can just sing some songs,
[26:09] design, uplift our hearts, Lord Jesus,
[26:13] and Lord be able to receive the word
[26:15] that will be coming very shortly. God,
[26:18] as we just commit the service unto you
[26:19] for your glory and your glory only, Lord
[26:22] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen, Lord.
[26:29] Amen. Thank you, my brother. You may
[26:30] have your seats
[26:33] tonight. Little change of pace. I heard
[26:36] an old old story. I love this old story.
[26:39] It's our salvation story. Well, I heard
[26:42] an old old
[26:44] story. How a savior came from
[26:49] glory. How he gave his life on
[26:53] Calvary to save a wretch like
[26:57] me. Well, I heard about

[27:20] savior

[27:50] his healing of
[27:53] his
[27:55] revealing how he made the lane to walk
[27:59] again and he calls I was so blind to
[28:02] see. Oh, and then I cried. Dear
[28:07] Jesus, come and heal
[28:10] my
[28:11] spirit. And somehow Jesus came and
[28:16] brought to me the
[28:19] victory. Oh yes.
[28:22] Victory in
[28:24] Jesus my
[28:26] savior forever.
[28:28] But he sought me. Oh, and he bought me

[28:37] loves me. I knew him and all my love is
[28:43] to him. He belongs me to
[28:48] victory beneath the
[28:52] blessing. Well, I heard about a mansion
[28:57] he has built for me in
[29:01] glory. And I heard about those streets
[29:04] of gold beyond the crystal
[29:09] sea about the angels singing and that
[29:14] old
[29:15] redemption
[29:17] glory and sun. May I sing up there that
[29:22] song of
[29:24] victory. Oh yes.
[29:27] Victory in
[29:29] Jesus my
[29:31] savior forever.

[33:48] [Music]
[33:50] Oh, precious the

[35:10] So I
[35:13] envision his
[35:17] beauty on his
[35:21] face. I saw
[35:23] love. I saw
[35:26] mercy and
[35:35] grapher. Won't you come and
[35:39] lead
[35:43] us? For we need you to help us find the
[35:52] way.
[35:57] Oh

[37:14] Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[37:16] the house of the Lord once again on a
[37:20] Wednesday evening. It's certainly good
[37:22] to be in his presence. Thankful for his
[37:26] tender grace and mercy in our
[37:28] lives. We just have a praise report we
[37:31] wanted to mention. Sister Michelle Livy
[37:33] wanted to say, "Thank you for all the
[37:36] prayers. By God's grace, I'm improving
[37:39] daily."
[37:40] We thank the Lord.
[37:42] We also have a request to pray for
[37:44] brother Gabriel who is not well and is
[37:47] at home tonight. Also the carpenters
[37:50] request prayer for sister
[37:53] Vanderlass as well as uh sister
[37:56] Rose. And uh if you have a need tonight,
[37:59] maybe just make it known unto him by way
[38:01] of an uplift hand. Gracious heavenly
[38:03] father, Lord Jesus, one more time. We
[38:06] need you to be our gentle shepherd,
[38:09] Lord,
[38:11] and to lead us,
[38:12] Father. Sometimes, Lord, we know that we
[38:16] don't know the way. And Father, we know
[38:18] that we have someone that we can trust,
[38:20] Lord. And we're so thankful for that,
[38:23] Lord. In the age in which we live where
[38:25] there's so much deception, Lord, so much
[38:28] confusion,
[38:30] Lord Jesus, tonight we come to you with
[38:32] our needs. We just bring each and every
[38:36] need that was made known unto you by way
[38:37] of an uplift hand, Father. And we just
[38:40] thank you, Father, for meeting that need
[38:42] sovereignly tonight.
[38:44] And Lord Jesus, we want to remember the
[38:46] carpenters, Lord. Sister
[38:48] Rose, Sister Elizabeth. Father, we know
[38:53] that you know the needs and that you're
[38:55] more than able to meet them tonight,
[38:56] Father.
[38:58] Lord, we just want to continue to thank
[39:00] you for healing Sister Michelle.
[39:03] And Lord, we just want to lift up
[39:05] brother Gabriel before you tonight,
[39:07] Lord, that you would touch him as well.
[39:10] Father, tonight we just want to commit
[39:12] the service into your hands for your
[39:13] glory. And Lord Jesus, I have a request
[39:16] tonight, Lord. And I believe it would be
[39:18] the same for each and every one here
[39:20] tonight, Lord. That you would just do
[39:21] something special for us tonight, Lord.
[39:25] Father, that our efforts wouldn't be in
[39:27] vain tonight, Lord. That Lord, you would
[39:30] just minister to us something special,
[39:33] Father, as we go forwards, we just
[39:36] commit the rest of this service into
[39:37] your hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[39:40] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank
[39:44] you, musicians.
[39:46] If you have your Bibles, I want to
[39:47] continue on our topic of election
[39:50] tonight out of the second epistle of
[39:53] Peter, chapter 1.
[40:01] Second Peter, chapter 1.
[40:14] Just start reading with verse one. Simon
[40:17] Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[40:19] Christ to them that have obtained like
[40:22] precious faith with us through the
[40:24] righteousness of God and our savior
[40:27] Jesus Christ.
[40:30] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[40:33] through the knowledge of God and of
[40:36] Jesus our Lord. according as his divine
[40:40] power hath given unto us all things that
[40:42] pertain unto life and
[40:45] godliness through the knowledge of him
[40:48] that hath called us to glory and
[40:52] virtue whereby are given unto us
[40:56] exceeding great and precious promises.
[40:59] Amen. That by these ye might be
[41:03] partakers of the divine
[41:05] nature, having escaped the corruption
[41:08] that is in the world through
[41:11] lust. Isn't that
[41:14] wonderful? Whereby are given unto us
[41:18] exceeding great and precious promises.
[41:22] But even more than the promises, that by
[41:25] these promises
[41:27] ye might be partakers of the divine
[41:31] nature,
[41:32] not a human nature.
[41:36] Verse five. And beside this, giving all
[41:40] diligence, add to your faith
[41:42] virtue, and to your virtue
[41:46] knowledge, and to knowledge
[41:49] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[41:51] and to patience godliness, and to
[41:54] godliness brotherly kindness, and to
[41:57] brotherly kindness charity.
[42:01] For if these things be in you and
[42:04] abound, they make you that ye shall
[42:06] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[42:10] knowledge of our Lord
[42:13] Jesus. But he that lackth these things
[42:17] is blind and cannot see a far
[42:21] off, and hath forgotten that he was
[42:25] purged from his old sins.
[42:29] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[42:32] diligence to make your calling and
[42:35] election
[42:36] sure. For if ye do these
[42:39] things, ye shall never fall.
[42:44] Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[42:46] Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful
[42:48] that you have given us exceeding great
[42:52] and precious promises, Lord. Amen.
[42:56] Father, that we can be partakers of your
[42:59] divine nature.
[43:02] Lord, we just want to ask that you would
[43:03] bless the reading of your word, that you
[43:05] would just open to us fresh once again,
[43:07] Lord, as we walk with you along the way.
[43:11] We just ask all these things in Jesus
[43:13] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[43:16] you tonight. You may be seated.
[43:23] Welcome to our visitors
[43:25] tonight, Brother Steve. God bless you.
[43:29] Like to say, uh, welcome back, Brother
[43:31] Peter. Certainly good to see you, too.
[43:33] He was working in Greenland for a few
[43:38] weeks. And everyone else tonight, I
[43:41] bring you greetings from the saints at
[43:43] Edmonton Living Word Assembly. Brother
[43:45] Eugene Bronn and his wife, Sister Sarah,
[43:49] say hello.
[43:51] It's a wonderful thing to go visit and
[43:54] to just preach the word, you know. And
[43:56] brother Toby at the same time was over
[43:58] ministering with brother Moses who I I
[44:02] believe he's the pastor now at brother
[44:04] Sigclar's church. I say brother
[44:07] Sigclar's church, but uh I believe it's
[44:10] brother Moses there now that's the
[44:12] pastor. And he was fellowshipping with
[44:14] brother Ed Hammermeister at End Time
[44:16] Message Tabernacle. And you know it's
[44:18] just a beautiful thing because the
[44:20] brethren they they performed that whole
[44:23] entire operation in unity. They
[44:26] discussed it openly and they prayed
[44:28] about it together and you know they just
[44:30] went forward walked together agreeing in
[44:33] the same thing. And uh it's just so
[44:36] wonderful to see the unity in the body
[44:39] between the two uh call it groups. And
[44:43] uh I know it's it's interesting because
[44:46] um there's something happening amongst
[44:49] the groups of churches at least in
[44:52] Edmonton, but I'm I'm seeing it in
[44:55] Saskatoon and I'm sure it's probably
[44:57] happening on the coast. I'm not out
[44:59] there very much so I don't know there
[45:01] but you know there's a certain unity
[45:03] that's taking place. Once upon a time it
[45:06] was division and uh confusion but it
[45:10] seems to be going the other way now. And
[45:12] I think that to me is such an
[45:13] encouragement. It really is uh the way
[45:16] it will go before the rapture. I I
[45:20] believe that with all my heart. We're
[45:22] not going to be divided. There won't be
[45:24] divisions. We will have all of these
[45:27] virtues in our life and we won't fall.
[45:31] Uh I think it's just a tremendous
[45:33] thing to be able to witness it. Um you
[45:38] might wonder how come the blinds are
[45:39] down. I don't know if anybody announced
[45:40] it and I know people don't like
[45:42] announcements, but we're going to have
[45:44] announcements tonight and uh hope it's
[45:46] okay. I just wanted to mention that
[45:47] we're changing the windows out in the
[45:49] building on the upper floor here. All
[45:51] the windows are being changed and we're
[45:53] certainly going to be thankful for that.
[45:54] I think it will help keep the the warm
[45:56] in in the wintertime and keep the warm
[45:59] out in the summertime. It will help keep
[46:01] us cool. So, we're certainly thankful
[46:03] for the trustees looking after that for
[46:05] us. And uh I just also wanted to
[46:08] mention, we had said it before in the
[46:10] past and I'll mention it again and I'll
[46:13] probably continue to mention it. If you
[46:14] have questions, please feel free to
[46:17] write them down. You know, if you were
[46:20] to listen to uh proving his word in
[46:23] 1964, brother Brandham, it's before he
[46:25] preached on questions and answers in
[46:27] 1964. He says it very clearly that it's
[46:31] really good to just write down the
[46:33] questions that are in your heart. If you
[46:36] have a question about something that's
[46:38] been preached or or mentioned or maybe
[46:40] something that hasn't been preached or
[46:42] something just Brother Brandham talks
[46:44] about it that's on your heart. Maybe
[46:45] you've got a a child that's gone weward.
[46:48] Maybe you have a spouse that just
[46:49] doesn't believe the same way. Maybe you
[46:52] just don't understand a certain
[46:53] scripture a certain way. You know, when
[46:56] we can actually express those thoughts,
[46:59] it gives us the ability to come together
[47:02] as a body and give the Lord the
[47:05] opportunity to minister to the need
[47:07] because likely it's not just one person
[47:09] with a question. There's probably more
[47:11] than one. So, I I just wanted to mention
[47:14] that we we don't have a questions and
[47:16] answers box, per se, but you'd be more
[47:18] than welcome to just take a prayer
[47:19] request sheet and just jot it down and
[47:23] fold it up and stick it in the box and
[47:26] uh we'll we'll address them. We'll go
[47:28] over the questions and and the answers
[47:30] if if people have them. Um we certainly
[47:33] want to give you the opportunity to
[47:35] express them. So, are you happy tonight?
[47:39] Tonight I want to continue talking about
[47:41] uh election and remembering that it's
[47:44] not about voting. It's not about being
[47:47] voted into a position of adoption. It's
[47:51] because we always were children that we
[47:54] get adopted to be a child to be a son.
[47:57] It's where God says now you have
[48:00] achieved a certain amount of learning.
[48:03] There's been enough tests in our lives
[48:06] and now we're going to take you out and
[48:08] actually proclaim to everyone that you
[48:11] are an adopted son, an adopted daughter.
[48:15] And that is because you always were.
[48:19] Brother Brham said, "I didn't actually
[48:21] go and join the Brham family one day."
[48:25] And and I could say that I didn't decide
[48:26] to go and join the Johnson family one
[48:29] day. I always was a part of the Johnson
[48:32] family. There just came a time where I
[48:35] was actually expressed into that family.
[48:38] And it's such a beautiful thing when we
[48:40] can look at being sons and daughters of
[48:42] the most high God. It it's not because
[48:44] we suddenly just became a son of God.
[48:47] It's because we recognize that we always
[48:49] were a son of God. It's not something
[48:52] that we can just fall into. And uh I
[48:55] think it's just a beautiful thing. You
[48:57] know, we we talked about this the last
[48:59] few services, and it might seem like a
[49:01] little bit of a
[49:03] uh repeat of some of the last few
[49:06] things, but there's just some points
[49:08] that I I I don't know if I could ever
[49:10] express how beautiful it is and how
[49:13] inspiring it is to me about being
[49:15] elected. to recognize that we have the
[49:17] ability to hear this word for our age is
[49:20] something that can never be
[49:21] underestimated or or overrated or or or
[49:25] said enough. I don't think it's
[49:27] something that we ought to celebrate to
[49:29] never ever take for granted the fact
[49:31] that we know that God sent a prophet.
[49:34] The only way that we really know that we
[49:37] can say we know that God sent a prophet
[49:39] because mom and dad said God sent a
[49:41] prophet and that's knowledge. But we
[49:43] don't want knowledge. Knowledge has got
[49:46] to do something for us. Knowledge has to
[49:48] get us to a place where it can move from
[49:51] the head down into the heart where God
[49:53] begins to reveal to
[49:55] us what that knowledge
[49:58] means. What does it mean to be a son of
[50:01] God? What does it mean to be a daughter
[50:03] of God? What does it mean to be elected
[50:06] to be predestined to actually be sons of
[50:09] God? That is the greatest calling that
[50:12] there is this side of eternity. Amen.
[50:16] There's no higher calling. There's no
[50:18] higher order. We could be a king. We
[50:21] could have all of the money and all of
[50:24] the Lamborghinis and all of the gold and
[50:27] all of the stuff. We could even have I
[50:29] believe in the message. Brother Brandham
[50:30] talks about it. What would you rather
[50:31] have? A thousand years? Would you rather
[50:34] have life for a thousand years and go to
[50:38] hell or actually live one more day?
[50:42] Maybe Brother Brown doesn't say it.
[50:43] Somebody else might. I I'm probably
[50:44] confusing myself. But live one more day
[50:48] and actually have eternal
[50:50] life. Or live as a popper, not have any
[50:54] money, eat soda crackers, and drink
[50:56] branch water, but know that you're a son
[50:58] of God. Amen.
[51:01] being predestined. Predestination, it
[51:04] looks back to fornowledge and
[51:06] fornowledge looks on destiny. Brother
[51:09] Brandham said, and we talked about this
[51:11] from the book of Ephesians, chapter 1.
[51:14] And sometimes I think it's just so
[51:16] wonderful to to read it and uh I'm I'm
[51:19] probably not going to go there tonight
[51:21] with us. I don't want to belabor it. But
[51:24] if we ever become a little bit down and
[51:26] a little bit confused about our walk and
[51:28] and what it means to truly be elected to
[51:31] to to be called to the highest position
[51:34] that we ever could be, Ephesians chapter
[51:37] 1 is a really good place to start. And I
[51:40] I believe it goes right back to talking
[51:42] about the children of Israel going into
[51:44] the promised land. You know, we know
[51:46] that brother Brandham said that the book
[51:48] of Ephesians perfectly parallels the
[51:50] book of Joshua. And maybe I've got that
[51:53] backwards. Once again, I confused
[51:55] myself. The book of Joshua perfectly
[51:57] parallels the book of Ephesians. The
[51:59] fact of the matter is the children of
[52:00] Israel are coming out of bondage, being
[52:03] slaves into the glorious liberty, taking
[52:07] on the divine nature, coming out of
[52:11] bondage and into freedom, being able to
[52:14] worship God the way that their fathers
[52:16] were promised in a land flowing full of
[52:18] milk and honey with no task masters over
[52:21] them. But we know it wasn't very long
[52:23] after they got in their promised land,
[52:24] what were they doing? looking around at
[52:26] all the other things in the world
[52:28] through the lust in their lives. And
[52:30] what did they do? They desired a king.
[52:32] They wanted to have a king like who?
[52:35] They wanted a king like their
[52:38] enemy. Not like their leader. They had
[52:40] God.
[52:42] But the prophet for the day just wasn't
[52:44] enough. Oh my. That prophetic utterance
[52:47] coming forward all the time telling them
[52:49] what to do. That guy, he thinks he's the
[52:51] only pebble on the beach, as it were. So
[52:55] they wanted to have a king just like
[52:56] their enemies. And we know that the
[52:59] prophet was insulted by that. The
[53:01] prophet was hurt by that. There was so
[53:03] many emotions in that prophet's heart.
[53:06] And we know God said to him, "You know
[53:08] what? They're not rejecting you. They're
[53:11] rejecting me."
[53:14] And it's no different
[53:16] today. When people reject the prophet,
[53:20] when people reject church order, they're
[53:23] not rejecting that church. They're not
[53:24] rejecting the prophet. They're rejecting
[53:28] God. But
[53:30] predestination about being
[53:33] called. I think it's so beautiful. Oh
[53:36] my. I was listening to uh proving his
[53:38] word and I just got so inspired by it.
[53:40] You know, God always proves his word.
[53:43] Many times we want to try and prove
[53:45] God's word, but we don't have to prove
[53:47] nothing. We've got nothing to prove. God
[53:50] will prove his word as long as we step
[53:53] back and allow him that opportunity to
[53:57] prove it in our lives. And when we're
[53:59] predestinated, when we're elected, we
[54:02] always will get in line with his word.
[54:04] We always will allow him to prove his
[54:08] own word in our lives. We won't have to
[54:10] do a thing about it. But I think
[54:12] footsteps being possession as the
[54:14] prophet taught us is such a beautiful
[54:16] thing. It's one thing to talk about the
[54:18] children of Israel coming out of the
[54:19] promise out of Egypt out of hard bondage
[54:21] for 430 years being overtime for the
[54:24] promise and then going into the land
[54:26] flowing full of milk and honey and
[54:28] seeing God move on their on their midst
[54:31] o over and over again killing their
[54:32] enemy pushing back all the borders
[54:34] giving them houses giving them gardens
[54:36] giving them honey and and and milk all
[54:39] of the stuff he promised just giving it
[54:41] to them and alls they had to do was
[54:43] surrender to him it's no different for
[54:46] us Today, brothers and sisters, the only
[54:48] thing is we're not coming out of a land.
[54:51] We're not coming out of a church. What
[54:53] we're doing is coming out of ourselves.
[54:57] This is the bondage right here. We've
[55:00] got to come out of this and get into
[55:03] him. But when we get into him, then we
[55:06] have full possession. And better yet, we
[55:09] don't have full possession. He has full
[55:11] possession. And when he has full
[55:13] possession, I I just think it's
[55:14] beautiful. We become the elected. We
[55:16] understand truly who our position is.
[55:19] And when the devil comes around, we can
[55:21] tell him to beat it. Now, we all live in
[55:23] the human condition. And I I'll tell
[55:25] you, I am no exception to that rule. And
[55:28] and I just can't help but think the Lord
[55:30] really wanted to do something special
[55:31] tonight because it was a slug of a of a
[55:35] a journey to get here today. But, you
[55:37] know, the Lord is good.
[55:40] And many times it feels like we've got
[55:42] to prove his word. We've got to do
[55:44] something. We just need to get in our
[55:45] position. And if we would focus in
[55:47] getting in our position, then we give
[55:49] him the opportunity to move. And I
[55:51] remember hearing about it just a little
[55:53] while ago. I think when I was in
[55:54] Edmonton, I was talking to someone about
[55:56] it about just staying in our lanes. If
[55:58] we could just stay in our lanes, if we
[55:59] could just get in our positions and do
[56:01] our very best in our positions, then God
[56:04] can move in our midst. Amen. Amen. But I
[56:08] just think this is beautiful. This uh
[56:10] this second epistle of Peter here, the
[56:12] beginning of it talking about, you know,
[56:14] if we're if we're rather making and
[56:17] giving diligence to make our own calling
[56:20] and election sure, then you know, we're
[56:23] going to be doing all these things.
[56:24] We're going to be adding to our faith
[56:26] virtue and to our virtue knowledge and
[56:28] to knowledge temperance and to
[56:29] temperance patience. Patience godliness,
[56:31] godliness, brotherly kindness, brotherly
[56:32] kindness, charity. And you know, we'll
[56:34] be doing this by following God's word
[56:36] without really realizing that I'm going
[56:39] to add to my faith virtue today. Now,
[56:42] I'm going to go over to the cupboard and
[56:43] I'm going to grab some knowledge and I'm
[56:45] going to open up to another chapter in
[56:47] the Bible and I'm going to find some
[56:48] temperance and then I'm going to press
[56:50] play in a message and I'm going to get
[56:52] me some patience. That's not the way it
[56:54] works. This is a spiritual blessing.
[56:56] This is the divine nature is what we're
[56:59] talking about. And there's only one way
[57:01] for this to come and that's by yielding
[57:03] to the Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ himself.
[57:06] And I think it's such a wonderful thing
[57:08] to know that, you know, we can be
[57:10] justified, picked up out of the chicken
[57:12] yard, that cup, we can be sanctified,
[57:15] all cleaned up and and set in the
[57:17] cupboard and set aside for service,
[57:18] maybe even set upside down so no dust
[57:21] can get in the cup. It's going to stay
[57:22] perfectly sterilized as good as can be.
[57:25] And then, you know, we can get filled.
[57:27] There's coming a time because we're set
[57:29] aside for service. Someone's going to
[57:30] take us out of the cupboard and fill us
[57:32] up. We're going to get filled. But you
[57:34] know, it's not just getting filled with
[57:36] the Holy Ghost. It's actually giving
[57:38] way. It's going further and giving way
[57:41] to Jesus Christ, the person of Jesus
[57:45] Christ, to live inside of our bodies, to
[57:49] live inside of our
[57:51] minds, to no longer be the same same
[57:54] humans that we once were. Let's turn
[57:56] over to Romans chapter nine. I believe
[57:58] we read this uh last time, but I just
[58:00] want to read it
[58:02] again. We're certainly thankful that
[58:04] brother Mvin and Sister Fay have made it
[58:06] back as well. They were in Rome for an
[58:10] anniversary trip and I believe the Lord
[58:12] really blessed them.
[58:16] It was pretty uh it was pretty funny
[58:19] when I was in Saskatoon. I preached on
[58:21] the masterpiece like we were preaching
[58:23] on it here and uh one of the brothers in
[58:26] the congregation is friends with brother
[58:28] Wayne Lawson and uh by the time I got
[58:32] out of service I had a picture on my
[58:34] phone of the exact masterpiece that we
[58:38] were preaching on that that sculpture of
[58:41] Moses. Brother Wayne was standing there
[58:44] at the time and had just taken the
[58:46] picture of that
[58:48] sculpture. It was really shocking to me
[58:50] to get out. I thought, is this a joke?
[58:52] And he was actually there in Rome. And
[58:54] brother Mvin sent me the same picture.
[58:56] It's pretty neat to see that that
[58:58] sculpture is uh is something else. It's
[59:01] really neat when we know about the
[59:02] masterpiece. We're not going to preach
[59:03] on that tonight, but uh welcome back,
[59:06] brother Murvin and Sister Fay. In Romans
[59:09] chapter 9 verse
[59:13] 1, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not,
[59:16] my conscience also bearing me witness in
[59:19] the Holy Ghost, that I have great
[59:21] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[59:23] heart. For I could wish that myself were
[59:27] a cursed from Christ for my brethren, my
[59:31] kinsmen according to the flesh. How many
[59:33] of us tonight would be able to say that
[59:35] same thing for our brothers and our
[59:36] sisters?
[59:38] Woo. Who are Israelites to whom
[59:42] pertainth the
[59:44] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[59:48] and the giving of the law and the and
[59:51] the service of God and the
[59:54] promises whose are the
[59:56] fathers and of whom as concerning the
[1:00:00] flesh Christ came who is over all God
[1:00:04] blessed forever. Amen.
[1:00:07] Not as though the word of God hath taken
[1:00:10] none
[1:00:11] effect. For they are are not all
[1:00:15] Israel, which are of
[1:00:18] Israel. Neither because
[1:00:22] are neither because they are the seed of
[1:00:25] Abraham are they all
[1:00:27] children. But in Isaac shall thy seed be
[1:00:32] called. That is they which are the
[1:00:36] children of the flesh. These are not the
[1:00:38] children of
[1:00:40] God, but the children of the promise are
[1:00:44] counted for the seed. Amen.
[1:00:47] For this is the word of promise. At this
[1:00:50] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[1:00:54] son. Now, we know this is actually Paul
[1:00:59] the Apostle speaking to the Romans in
[1:01:02] this epistle, quoting Genesis 18,
[1:01:07] talking about the three men that came to
[1:01:10] the plains of Mammory and met Abram and
[1:01:14] Sarah while they were in the tent. And
[1:01:17] we know that Abram, he recognized one
[1:01:22] Lord. Amen. Even though there was three,
[1:01:26] he said, "My Lord, come in." And we
[1:01:28] talked about this last time. I think
[1:01:29] it's so beautiful to think how much time
[1:01:30] did they get to spend together. They
[1:01:32] must had some conversation for the
[1:01:34] amount of time it would take to bake the
[1:01:35] bread, cook it, uh uh slaughter a cow,
[1:01:39] cook it up, wash the feet, be able to
[1:01:42] fellowship with Elohim. We I just it's
[1:01:45] mind-boggling to think about, but that's
[1:01:47] what happened. And uh that's what
[1:01:49] they're quoting here. That's what Paul's
[1:01:50] quoting here in uh Romans chapter nine.
[1:01:53] that whole story and and we know that
[1:01:56] even at that time Sarah she laughed up
[1:01:58] her sleeve brother Brandham said and if
[1:02:00] it wasn't for her being a part of
[1:02:03] Abraham he would have destroyed her but
[1:02:07] he would have hurt his son also so he
[1:02:10] never did that what a mighty God we
[1:02:13] serve
[1:02:14] in Romans 9 verse 10 and not only this
[1:02:20] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[1:02:24] one, even by our father
[1:02:28] Isaac, for the children not yet born,
[1:02:33] neither having done any good or evil,
[1:02:36] that the purpose of God according to
[1:02:38] election might
[1:02:40] stand, not of
[1:02:42] works, but of him that calleth. Amen.
[1:02:47] It was said unto her, "The elder shall
[1:02:50] serve the younger. At is as it is
[1:02:53] written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[1:02:57] have I
[1:02:58] hated." How can we explain this verse?
[1:03:01] How can we explain this chapter? It's
[1:03:05] God's choice. And we know that in the
[1:03:07] church age book, we studied it. This is
[1:03:09] where this whole question came up. But
[1:03:11] brother Bradom says it that we have to
[1:03:13] just simply accept it. We have to accept
[1:03:15] the way God's choice is. There's no way
[1:03:18] that we can comprehend this with the
[1:03:20] human mind. We can't reason it. We can't
[1:03:23] even really understand it. But we trust
[1:03:25] God. And every single one of us for us
[1:03:29] to recognize that one of us is
[1:03:32] Esau and one of us is a
[1:03:36] is my goodness to think about this. The
[1:03:40] children not yet being born, neither
[1:03:42] having done any good or
[1:03:44] evil. My goodness, one of them is chosen
[1:03:49] unto election, and the other one is
[1:03:51] chosen unto destruction.
[1:03:55] God's choice.
[1:03:57] That's where I I just can't believe it
[1:03:59] when we maybe sometimes find ourselves
[1:04:02] getting a little puffed up in our minds
[1:04:04] thinking that we've done something or
[1:04:06] we're going to do something or we are
[1:04:08] something. We're nothing.
[1:04:12] We're God's choice. It's because he
[1:04:14] chose us first.
[1:04:18] How could we ever put the finger on
[1:04:21] anybody and say serpent seed?
[1:04:25] How could we ever say someone is out and
[1:04:29] someone is in? This is God's choice.
[1:04:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:36] But we know the devil gets in and allows
[1:04:39] some people to think that's part of the
[1:04:40] divine
[1:04:41] nature. I've got that divine nature. So
[1:04:44] I'm part of God. So maybe I can help
[1:04:46] make a decision for
[1:04:48] him, right? And that's just the
[1:04:54] devil. Because we know Christ would that
[1:04:56] everyone would repent and come to full
[1:05:00] adoption.
[1:05:02] I just think it's beautiful. You know,
[1:05:04] the uh the scripture that we read here
[1:05:07] is interesting because in in in verse 7
[1:05:11] it says, "Neither because they are the
[1:05:14] seed of Abraham are they all children.
[1:05:17] Just because they're in that lineage
[1:05:19] doesn't mean they're all children. Just
[1:05:20] because I have children, I'm going to
[1:05:23] say this and and it hurts to even say
[1:05:26] it. doesn't mean that all of the lineage
[1:05:28] beyond me are actually counted to the
[1:05:31] promise. I want to say they are, but
[1:05:33] it's not my choice. It's God's choice.
[1:05:37] Amen. I trust him. Amen.
[1:05:41] I'm going to do everything I can to
[1:05:43] encourage my
[1:05:44] lineage. Everything I can, not to
[1:05:46] discourage my lineage, but to
[1:05:49] encourage. Neither because are they the
[1:05:52] seed of Abraham are they all children.
[1:05:55] But in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[1:05:57] Only through one. And now I'm not saying
[1:05:59] this because we have a son named Isaac.
[1:06:01] I'm
[1:06:02] sorry. Benjamin and Christopher, don't
[1:06:05] worry. Both of your names are in the
[1:06:08] Bible and you're in the lineage. It's
[1:06:10] good. But this is what the word said
[1:06:12] about Isaac. And uh we know through him
[1:06:16] there was Esau and Jacob. But verse
[1:06:19] eight, it says that is they which are
[1:06:21] the children of the flesh. These are not
[1:06:25] the children of God. But the children of
[1:06:28] the promise are counted for the seed.
[1:06:31] For this is the word of promise. At this
[1:06:33] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[1:06:35] son. I just can't help but think that
[1:06:37] Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are
[1:06:40] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[1:06:44] sons of God." Verse 13 says it. For if
[1:06:47] you live verse 12, therefore, brethren,
[1:06:50] we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
[1:06:52] live after the flesh. If we're caught up
[1:06:55] living in the flesh, then we're we're
[1:06:56] we're missing the point
[1:06:59] here. Verse 13 says, "For if you live
[1:07:02] after the flesh, ye shall die. But if ye
[1:07:06] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:07:08] of the body, ye shall
[1:07:12] live. For as many as are led by the
[1:07:15] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[1:07:16] For ye have not received the bond the
[1:07:19] spirit of bondage again to
[1:07:23] fear. Remember that that fear is a
[1:07:26] spirit. But ye have received the spirit
[1:07:30] of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba,
[1:07:33] Father." And this is the beautiful part.
[1:07:35] Verse 16, I think, is really where I I
[1:07:38] say it often, is where the rubber meets
[1:07:40] the road. The spirit itself beareth
[1:07:43] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:07:46] sons of God. And I think it's so
[1:07:48] beautiful because that's why the sons
[1:07:49] and daughters have come out to church on
[1:07:51] a Wednesday night because we know that
[1:07:54] we should uh forsake not the assembling
[1:07:56] of ourselves even more so as we see that
[1:07:59] day approaching and we know that it's
[1:08:01] never been closer than it is tonight.
[1:08:04] You know, last time I think we talked
[1:08:06] about the the faith of Abraham. I'm
[1:08:08] going to read the same quote again. It's
[1:08:09] just so good. Um, the faith of Abraham
[1:08:12] 1955. Abraham, what was it now? God
[1:08:15] called Abraham because he was a good
[1:08:18] man. No, God called Abraham by election.
[1:08:24] God elects
[1:08:28] people. And as we talk about this, I
[1:08:30] want to say this tonight. You know,
[1:08:33] Brother Brandham said it. There's one
[1:08:34] clear evidence of the baptism of the
[1:08:36] Holy Ghost. At one time, he thought it
[1:08:37] was love.
[1:08:40] And true
[1:08:41] enough, people who do know Jesus Christ,
[1:08:44] they have love. And we know that that's
[1:08:46] the the the crowning virtue of the seven
[1:08:49] virtues that we read there is charity,
[1:08:51] which is love. But it's also the Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost. And you know, the the the
[1:08:57] unfailing proof that brother Brandham
[1:08:59] said when he had the conversation with
[1:09:01] the teacher, Dr. Lee Vale. He said that
[1:09:04] that that unfailing proof God corrected
[1:09:07] him on that in that conversation that he
[1:09:09] had with Dr. Lee Vale where he said, you
[1:09:11] know, I'm sure that it's love. He said
[1:09:12] God came and told brother Bradam
[1:09:15] afterwards, you know what it is? Is your
[1:09:17] ability to receive the word for your
[1:09:18] day.
[1:09:20] That is the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:23] Because the devil can impersonate any
[1:09:25] gift.
[1:09:27] The devil can speak in any language. The
[1:09:30] devil can even
[1:09:31] interpret. The devil can give a lot of
[1:09:34] money. The devil can come as a an angel
[1:09:38] of light into Martin's study. We know
[1:09:42] that story. The devil can impersonate
[1:09:45] any gift, but he cannot take the word of
[1:09:48] God.
[1:09:50] He doesn't believe it.
[1:09:52] He just doesn't believe it. He just
[1:09:54] plain doesn't believe the word of God.
[1:09:56] He doesn't believe that he is actually
[1:09:58] going to be destroyed. He believes that
[1:09:59] he's going to win. He believes that. He
[1:10:02] doesn't believe that there's truly
[1:10:04] adopted sons and daughters of God. He
[1:10:06] didn't believe that Jesus was God.
[1:10:11] He still doesn't.
[1:10:13] And you still hear that spirit pop up
[1:10:15] every now and again. It's just a man.
[1:10:17] Yeah. Right. God elects people. And over
[1:10:21] in the book of Ephesians, the first
[1:10:22] chapter and about the fifth verse, Paul
[1:10:25] states the word
[1:10:27] predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:10:31] sons. We didn't even choose that
[1:10:33] position. He predestinated us to that.
[1:10:37] We just came to the place where we're
[1:10:38] we're recognizing it.
[1:10:41] What
[1:10:43] me did you ever have that realization?
[1:10:46] You've been predestinated to be a son of
[1:10:49] God, an adopted son of the most high
[1:10:53] God. 8.3 billion people in this world.
[1:10:57] And he chose you.
[1:11:00] And I'm going to jump to the bunch line.
[1:11:02] I'm going to get to a little bit later.
[1:11:03] But he chose you for a reason. Because
[1:11:06] every single church age there has been,
[1:11:09] he has had a representation of not the
[1:11:12] Bible, not the church himself.
[1:11:15] He's had a representation of himself.
[1:11:18] Why? So that he can prove his own word
[1:11:20] in those people.
[1:11:24] So if you are an adopted son, an adopted
[1:11:27] daughter of God tonight, he has made you
[1:11:29] that so he can prove his own word
[1:11:32] through you.
[1:11:36] God elects
[1:11:37] people. I love that Paul states the word
[1:11:41] predestination. predestined us to the
[1:11:44] adoption of sons. Now, that doesn't mean
[1:11:46] God just puts you in a little channel
[1:11:48] and runs you through and you can't help
[1:11:51] how you go. What would be no
[1:11:54] reward, but God gives you the free moral
[1:11:58] agency to recognize your day and its
[1:12:01] message.
[1:12:03] He gives you the free moral agency to
[1:12:05] say, "Mama, that's me.
[1:12:09] I recognize it." Amen.
[1:12:12] And you know what that is, brothers and
[1:12:13] sisters? I think that's so beautiful.
[1:12:15] That's where God is starting to see his
[1:12:17] masterpiece.
[1:12:19] He's starting to see himself reflecting
[1:12:22] back.
[1:12:24] He doesn't just put you in a little
[1:12:25] channel and run you through. God gives
[1:12:28] you the free moral agency, my to make
[1:12:31] your choice.
[1:12:34] But God will keep his believer. Isn't
[1:12:37] that beautiful?
[1:12:38] I just got into this a little bit today
[1:12:40] and I was thinking about Jonah, Jonah
[1:12:42] and the whale. We often talk about it
[1:12:45] and you know, brother Random, he tells
[1:12:46] the story and he makes it real clear
[1:12:48] when he talks about Jonah and I'm just
[1:12:50] going to jump on it for a couple minutes
[1:12:52] here. We still have lots of time. Thank
[1:12:54] you, Lord. He he talks about Jonah in
[1:12:56] the denominational world. You hear them
[1:12:58] talk about him being a backslider. He's
[1:13:00] a bad guy. Jonah, he's running from God.
[1:13:04] And Jonah, how terrible he is. Brother
[1:13:07] Brandham says, "No, no, no. He was in
[1:13:09] the will of God. He was actually not a
[1:13:13] backslider. Jonah was doing exactly what
[1:13:15] God wanted him to do."
[1:13:18] Now, some people would say, "Brother
[1:13:20] Barry, why would you say that?" Because
[1:13:21] if he would have just went to the people
[1:13:23] of Nineveh, he could have preached to
[1:13:25] them. But you know, one thing Brother
[1:13:27] Bradam brings out in the message is
[1:13:30] would they have received him? Probably
[1:13:32] not. Why not? because they worshiped
[1:13:35] fish.
[1:13:38] And he also brings out a correction with
[1:13:41] the denominational world that it wasn't
[1:13:43] a whale, that it was a fish. The Bible
[1:13:46] says a fish. These people worshiped
[1:13:49] fish. The god of fish. And what
[1:13:52] happened? The god comes to the shore and
[1:13:55] spits out a prophet.
[1:14:00] And the prophet goes and gives them a
[1:14:02] prophetic utterance and says, "Repent or
[1:14:04] perish." Isn't it beautiful? That's the
[1:14:07] same prophet that came to this age, too,
[1:14:09] that said, "Just get back in line with
[1:14:11] the word. Repent or perish."
[1:14:15] And the truly elected will repent.
[1:14:18] Because God always keeps his believer.
[1:14:22] He doesn't let his believer go. No, no,
[1:14:25] no. He might take his believer to the
[1:14:27] bottom of the ocean for a couple days
[1:14:29] and maybe cause them to look around and
[1:14:32] and see seaweed this direction and see
[1:14:34] seaweed that direction and and seaweed
[1:14:37] and seaweed and and everything you see
[1:14:40] is problem problem until one day that
[1:14:44] time comes in our life where we start to
[1:14:46] think wait a second this is not my
[1:14:49] position this is not my
[1:14:51] calling there's a temple that I've been
[1:14:54] told if I look towards that temple and I
[1:14:56] pray, oh my, that he'll hear my prayer.
[1:15:02] Now, this is a this is a a Jew
[1:15:06] quoting a prayer like that, brothers and
[1:15:07] sisters. How much more a son and
[1:15:09] daughter, a a predestinated son and
[1:15:11] daughter, an adopted son and daughter,
[1:15:14] someone who is elected by fornowledge
[1:15:17] before the foundation of the world, who
[1:15:18] would lift up their voice, who would
[1:15:20] close their eyes and open their heart
[1:15:21] and say, "Lord, hear my prayer. Yes,
[1:15:28] God will keep his believer. So
[1:15:30] beautiful. He goes on to say, "And
[1:15:31] predestination is a hard word among a
[1:15:34] congregation of people because
[1:15:36] predestination really fornowledge is a
[1:15:39] better word. And predestination looks
[1:15:40] back to fornowledge. And fornowledge
[1:15:43] looks onto destiny.
[1:15:45] were destined to sit with him in his
[1:15:48] throne, judging angels, judging the the
[1:15:53] billions and billions of people
[1:15:55] throughout all the
[1:15:57] ages predestined to set there with
[1:16:01] him. And predestination looks back to
[1:16:03] fornowledge, full knowledge, looks at
[1:16:04] destiny that God being infinite in the
[1:16:07] beginning knew the end from the
[1:16:09] beginning.
[1:16:13] Sometimes I think we just need to take
[1:16:14] courage in in in reading this and just
[1:16:17] just knowing that he he knows everything
[1:16:19] from the end to the beginning and and
[1:16:21] it's all completely under his control.
[1:16:24] Therefore, he knew what people would do.
[1:16:27] He's not surprised by our behavior.
[1:16:30] Sometimes, many times, I'm surprised by
[1:16:32] my behavior. Are you ever surprised by
[1:16:34] your behavior? I know we're surprised by
[1:16:36] other people's behavior, but sometimes
[1:16:39] we we just need to take a step back and
[1:16:41] gasp and think, "Did I say that? Did I
[1:16:43] do that? Did I think that?"
[1:16:46] But he knew all about it. Before there
[1:16:49] was a speck of stardust, he knew that's
[1:16:52] who we would be. And that our free will
[1:16:54] would always come subject to his word.
[1:16:57] It's so beautiful to think that he has
[1:16:59] that under control. My He knew what
[1:17:01] people would do. He knew what I would
[1:17:03] do. He knew what you would do. so he
[1:17:05] could foretell what would take place for
[1:17:07] he knew what would be.
[1:17:13] I think this too brothers and sisters I
[1:17:15] have to say it is you know we say many
[1:17:17] times the ability to to have the
[1:17:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:17:20] is to say amen to the word of God. You
[1:17:23] know saying amen to the word of God is
[1:17:25] only that much of
[1:17:27] it. Some people might say brother Barry
[1:17:30] that's not what the prophet said. But
[1:17:33] I'll say this. If we truly say amen to
[1:17:37] the word of God, that means that we will
[1:17:39] live the word of God. And even more so
[1:17:42] than that, that means that the word of
[1:17:44] God will begin to live out through us.
[1:17:47] We don't even have to
[1:17:49] try. We just love our brother. We don't
[1:17:52] have to try. It's so beautiful. He goes
[1:17:56] on to say here, therefore he before Esau
[1:17:58] or Jacob, either one was born, God could
[1:18:02] say, Esau I've hated and Jacob I loved
[1:18:05] because he forneew what they could
[1:18:08] be. He never made Esau the way he was.
[1:18:12] He wasn't willing that Esau would be
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:15] way. But Esau by
[1:18:19] choice, God knew would take that way.
[1:18:24] And brothers and sisters, I I just want
[1:18:26] to try and pull this out of here
[1:18:28] tonight. Pull this out of the message
[1:18:29] and and spread it around a little bit
[1:18:31] for us to look at and think about all of
[1:18:34] the esau that we see in this world. How
[1:18:37] many es do we see? We don't
[1:18:40] know. But how many of them do we have an
[1:18:43] opportunity to try and
[1:18:45] encourage, to try and love, to try and
[1:18:48] show them Jesus Christ? We know the
[1:18:49] message says this might be the only
[1:18:51] Jesus Christ they'll ever see. is that
[1:18:54] moment of interaction in our
[1:18:57] life. If we're a Jacob and he loved us,
[1:19:02] I can't see how we could ever hate
[1:19:05] another human
[1:19:06] being. You know, Brother Brandham said
[1:19:08] when he went into the regions of the
[1:19:10] lost, he came back. He said, "You
[1:19:11] wouldn't wish that on your worst
[1:19:13] enemy." I can't imagine what it would be
[1:19:16] like. I don't want to imagine what it
[1:19:18] would be
[1:19:18] like. But to have a prophet of God say
[1:19:21] that, I've been there and I've seen it.
[1:19:23] And we wouldn't wish that on our worst
[1:19:25] enemy.
[1:19:28] Boy, he never made Esau the way he was.
[1:19:31] Can you imagine that? He never made him
[1:19:33] the way he was. He chose it. He chose
[1:19:36] that.
[1:19:38] You've heard it said many times that,
[1:19:39] you know, we're going to fight our way
[1:19:40] to heaven and we're going to fight our
[1:19:43] way to hell.
[1:19:45] It's our choice. We're free moral
[1:19:47] agents.
[1:19:48] And I know that might get some people
[1:19:50] upset to say that because the true
[1:19:52] believers aren't going to fight their
[1:19:53] way to hell. What they are going to do
[1:19:55] is fight their way to actually
[1:19:57] surrendering to the word, to
[1:20:00] surrendering to some prayer time, to
[1:20:02] surrendering to coming to church on a
[1:20:04] Wednesday
[1:20:05] night. He never made Esau the way he
[1:20:07] was. He wasn't willing that Esau would
[1:20:09] be that way. But Esau by choice, God
[1:20:13] knew, would take that way. So that's how
[1:20:16] he knows us today. He knows your
[1:20:20] heart. And if you might be able to fool
[1:20:23] your neighbor, you might be able to fool
[1:20:28] your
[1:20:29] pastor, but you'll never be able to fool
[1:20:33] God because he knows your heart.
[1:20:38] I say, "Lord, have mercy. Lord, help
[1:20:42] me."
[1:20:44] Therefore, he by
[1:20:46] election he chose
[1:20:51] Abraham. And remember, brothers and
[1:20:53] sisters, Abraham was given an
[1:20:56] unconditional
[1:20:58] covenant.
[1:21:00] Unconditional. Can you imagine that? If
[1:21:02] you had an
[1:21:04] unconditional covenant in this world
[1:21:06] with anything, maybe you had an
[1:21:08] unconditional covenant with a bank
[1:21:10] account. You just had a bank card. And
[1:21:13] maybe it was gold or platinum color and
[1:21:16] there was no limit. It was just
[1:21:18] unconditional. Don't worry about it.
[1:21:20] Just help yourself. As much as you want,
[1:21:22] just go ahead and
[1:21:23] take. You had an unconditional discharge
[1:21:28] from a judgment with a judge. Have you
[1:21:31] ever seen that before? Where somebody
[1:21:33] has to go before a judge for charges
[1:21:36] that are brought up against them and and
[1:21:38] a judge says, "You know what? I I see no
[1:21:41] need to follow up with this and I'm
[1:21:43] going to issue an unconditional
[1:21:46] discharge. That means there's no more
[1:21:50] charges. There's no more record. There's
[1:21:53] nothing
[1:21:55] unconditionally set free. to think that
[1:21:58] Abraham was given an unconditional
[1:22:02] covenant with God, to be a friend of
[1:22:05] God, to be the heir, to be the one that
[1:22:09] God chose to have the lineage come
[1:22:13] through. And we as sons and daughters
[1:22:16] are the royal seed of Abraham. Amen.
[1:22:22] If he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:22:23] forever, brothers and sisters, you got
[1:22:25] an unconditional covenant with God. And
[1:22:27] I think that's so beautiful. I've got an
[1:22:29] unconditional covenant with God. It just
[1:22:31] is so humbling. It just makes me want to
[1:22:33] scream and shout. It makes it so easy to
[1:22:35] worship when we can recognize election.
[1:22:38] Goodness. Therefore, he by election he
[1:22:41] chose Abraham for he knew what Abraham
[1:22:43] would do. And you remember when he
[1:22:46] called him out there and said he'd not
[1:22:48] keep that secret from him when he was
[1:22:52] going down to destroy Sodom and
[1:22:54] Gomorrah.
[1:22:55] He said,"For I know Abraham will teach
[1:22:58] his children. I know it. God himself. I
[1:23:01] know that Abraham will send this message
[1:23:04] on down from one to the other
[1:23:08] generation." So, brothers and sisters,
[1:23:10] when we hear these words, can we
[1:23:12] recognize that we're willing recipients
[1:23:15] because of fornowledge? We're here. God
[1:23:18] knew that we would be here, but we're
[1:23:20] actually receiving what he knew Abraham
[1:23:24] would take and pass down properly
[1:23:26] through his lineage.
[1:23:29] My, we are recipients of that. That
[1:23:34] message sent down from one generation to
[1:23:37] the other down through time. What was
[1:23:40] it? 2,000 years, 2500 years, 3,000
[1:23:45] years, maybe more.
[1:23:48] 4,000. Brother Mvin would be able to
[1:23:51] nail it for us, I'm sure. Thousands of
[1:23:55] years, generation to generation to
[1:23:58] generation to generation to generation.
[1:24:00] This message, the same message, Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:24:06] forever. Jesus Christ who met with
[1:24:10] Abraham on the plains of Mamry. And now
[1:24:13] we know people will say, "Well, brother
[1:24:14] Barry, that was that was a man and and
[1:24:17] brother Brandham said that he picked up
[1:24:19] a 16 elements
[1:24:21] and stepped into a body." But who was
[1:24:24] it? Who is Melzdc? Just listen to that
[1:24:28] message. Who is Melzdc? Who is Jesus
[1:24:30] Christ?
[1:24:32] The third person or the second person?
[1:24:34] He's the person of the Holy Trinity.
[1:24:38] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:24:40] and forever. the name of God to man,
[1:24:46] Jesus
[1:24:47] Christ. But God for knowing that and
[1:24:49] knowing that Abraham would do it, then
[1:24:51] he told Abraham in the beginning that he
[1:24:53] would save him and save his seed after
[1:24:55] him. And you're his seed after him
[1:24:59] and would give him the unconditional
[1:25:01] covenant that he made with Abraham, not
[1:25:03] because he was good, but because God was
[1:25:06] good.
[1:25:09] And every believer here is a Christian
[1:25:11] tonight. Not that you're good, because
[1:25:14] God was good to call you.
[1:25:18] That's why we're here tonight. It's so
[1:25:20] beautiful. Then let's turn over to
[1:25:22] Romans 11. Amen.
[1:25:27] Romans
[1:25:28] 11. Romans 11
[1:25:33] verse. Well, we just start with verse
[1:25:35] one. Why not?
[1:25:41] I say then, hath God cast away his
[1:25:44] people? God forbid. For I also am an
[1:25:48] Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the
[1:25:50] tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast
[1:25:52] away his people, which he
[1:25:54] forneew. What ye not what the scripture
[1:25:57] saith of Elias? How he maketh
[1:25:59] intercession to God against Israel,
[1:26:02] saying, Lord, they have killed thy
[1:26:04] prophets. dig down thine altars, and I
[1:26:06] am left alone, and they seek my life.
[1:26:09] But what saith the answer of God unto
[1:26:11] him? I have reserved myself 7,000 men
[1:26:14] who have not bowed the knee to the image
[1:26:17] of
[1:26:18] Baal. Even so then, at this present time
[1:26:21] also, there is a remnant according to
[1:26:24] the election of grace.
[1:26:28] And I I just have to say it tonight. We
[1:26:30] can see it right here tonight. There is
[1:26:33] a remnant according to the election of
[1:26:36] grace.
[1:26:37] And if by grace then it is no more
[1:26:42] works.
[1:26:43] Otherwise, grace is no more
[1:26:46] grace. So it doesn't matter how many
[1:26:48] times we come to church. Doesn't matter
[1:26:51] how we comb our hair. Doesn't matter how
[1:26:53] clean our rims are on our car. It
[1:26:56] doesn't matter how long we've served
[1:26:58] God. It doesn't matter. It's not works.
[1:27:02] It's election. It's fornowledge. It's
[1:27:05] predestination
[1:27:07] unto election by his grace. But if it be
[1:27:11] of works, then it is no more grace.
[1:27:16] Otherwise, work is no more
[1:27:18] work. What then? Israel hath not
[1:27:22] obtained that which he seeketh
[1:27:24] for, but the election hath obtained it.
[1:27:29] and the rest were
[1:27:31] blinded. This scripture here just jumps
[1:27:34] out at me to think about it. The rest
[1:27:38] were
[1:27:39] blinded. Israel hath not obtained it,
[1:27:43] that which he seeks. Israel, we know
[1:27:47] Jacob, he had his name changed, right?
[1:27:51] that night where he was alone in prayer.
[1:27:53] He took his time and he found himself
[1:27:57] coming face to face with the angel of
[1:27:59] the Lord. And what happened? This was
[1:28:01] before he crossed over following the
[1:28:03] Lord. A and what happened was he
[1:28:06] actually had a change in his
[1:28:08] walk. He wrestled with that angel. Some
[1:28:11] of the stories are just amazing to think
[1:28:13] about. Hey, would we be able to wrestle
[1:28:15] with an angel of the Lord? And to think
[1:28:17] that this wasn't just any ordinary angel
[1:28:19] either. This was the angel that actually
[1:28:21] changed his name. This is another
[1:28:24] version, another example of how God
[1:28:26] expresses himself to people. And and
[1:28:29] here we have this man. He got his name
[1:28:31] changed and his walk changed. I say,
[1:28:34] "Lord, please change my name and change
[1:28:37] my walk. Let me not walk the same as I
[1:28:40] used to walk." But all of Israel, the
[1:28:43] the Jews, they are still trying to seek
[1:28:47] this blessing and they're not finding
[1:28:49] it. They're blinded for our sakes.
[1:28:53] But the election hath obtained it just
[1:28:56] because they're elected to. But we
[1:29:00] know any day now we're going to see
[1:29:04] witnesses pop up in Israel and and who
[1:29:07] knows whether the bride is going to be
[1:29:08] here or gone. We don't know, but we know
[1:29:11] that's going to happen. And and the
[1:29:13] anointing on the Gentile church is
[1:29:16] lifting off and it's heading back to
[1:29:18] Israel. And you know, it's interesting,
[1:29:20] brothers and sisters. I I do watch the
[1:29:22] news because I'm very interested in all
[1:29:25] the happenings that are going on, which
[1:29:26] I'm sure we all are. But did anybody see
[1:29:28] that the Pope has now spoken out about
[1:29:30] Gaza? There's a brand new pope that pops
[1:29:33] up and immediately he's talking about
[1:29:35] Gaza. Now, we need to come to the aid of
[1:29:37] the Gazins.
[1:29:39] What does that mean? That means now the
[1:29:42] whole world is going to start coming
[1:29:44] against
[1:29:50] how late is it? My goodness. You know,
[1:29:53] it's beautiful. Another example that
[1:29:54] brother Brandham uses is God has an
[1:29:56] economy and he talks about Abraham being
[1:29:58] a silver dollar and Lot just being a
[1:30:00] maybe a penny. And you know, God has an
[1:30:03] economy and and there's people that are
[1:30:05] silver dollars and there's half dollars
[1:30:07] and maybe there's loonies. There's
[1:30:09] loonies for sure and there's tunis. God
[1:30:12] has an economy. It's God's economy. It's
[1:30:15] not up to us to choose who's who who's
[1:30:18] what what our what our value is. We know
[1:30:20] that one soul is worth 10,000 worlds.
[1:30:24] That's what the word says. That's what
[1:30:25] we want to take it at. We don't want to
[1:30:28] try and put anybody in or anybody out.
[1:30:30] God's economy is is his election and
[1:30:33] it's so beautiful. In 1964, brother
[1:30:36] Brandham, he preaches a sermon called
[1:30:37] God's word calls for a total separation
[1:30:40] from unbelief. He says, "All these
[1:30:42] believers, as we could go on for hours,
[1:30:45] all these were like a bunch of change
[1:30:47] out of your pocket in God's hands. You
[1:30:50] pull out a bunch of change. There is
[1:30:53] pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half
[1:30:54] dollars, dollar, all in coins." Now,
[1:30:58] that's what the world is in God's hand.
[1:31:00] There's some people that can just have a
[1:31:03] penny's worth of it, and God can only
[1:31:05] use them in a penny way. And you know,
[1:31:09] Lord, forgive us for thinking that that
[1:31:11] that one should actually be used in a
[1:31:14] dollar way.
[1:31:18] He says that's all they can buy.
[1:31:22] But don't reject them.
[1:31:25] If they can't believe the real
[1:31:27] truth, don't turn them down.
[1:31:32] Don't kick them out and say they're not
[1:31:35] in
[1:31:36] it because God uses pennies sometimes.
[1:31:41] And I love that because even though the
[1:31:45] prophet said
[1:31:47] that just because the governments have
[1:31:49] kicked out pennies, it doesn't mean
[1:31:51] there's no pennies in God's
[1:31:53] economy. And you know, you can take
[1:31:56] copper and you can polish it up pretty
[1:31:59] shiny. It's got a pretty good shine when
[1:32:01] it's polished properly. But you know,
[1:32:04] God uses pennies sometimes. And he says
[1:32:07] it here, Lot was just a penny. Abraham
[1:32:10] was a silver dollar. So it taken a
[1:32:13] hundred lots to make an Abraham. And you
[1:32:16] know, brothers and sisters, there's the
[1:32:18] elected people that will go in the
[1:32:21] rapture. There's a very few people that
[1:32:23] will actually take the rapture. And you
[1:32:25] know, Brother Brandham, he said it in a
[1:32:27] city of a million people, there ought to
[1:32:29] be one person crying, and that ought to
[1:32:31] be you crying, Lord, let it be me.
[1:32:36] Yes. And that's astounding to think
[1:32:38] about in a city like this because we can
[1:32:40] look at how big is this city. How many
[1:32:42] people are in this city? It's just over
[1:32:43] a million people. We don't want to see
[1:32:46] one person from this church go. We want
[1:32:48] to see the whole church go.
[1:32:53] But to think there's other people in
[1:32:55] this city that might not go in the
[1:32:57] rapture, but that doesn't mean they're
[1:32:59] not actually still in the economy of
[1:33:01] God. Right?
[1:33:04] You know, there's five wise and there's
[1:33:06] five unwise virgins. And we talk about
[1:33:09] them many, many times. But the five
[1:33:12] wise, the difference between them and
[1:33:14] the unwise is they had oil. The wise
[1:33:17] ones had oil. They're the ones that
[1:33:18] wanted to actually continually ask the
[1:33:22] Lord to top them up with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:25] because the oil typifies the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:27] And you know, we can never ever preach
[1:33:30] too much on the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:33] Ghost because without the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:34] there's no rapture. Without the Holy
[1:33:36] Ghost, we are not saved. We are lost as
[1:33:38] lost can be. And you know, we might have
[1:33:40] the Holy Ghost, but our children might
[1:33:42] not. And you know, if our children do,
[1:33:44] someone else's children might not. So,
[1:33:46] how could we ever say, "Oh my, we've
[1:33:48] heard enough about talking about the
[1:33:49] Holy Ghost."
[1:33:51] You know, Jesus was here and he walked
[1:33:53] in the flesh. God came down in many
[1:33:56] different forms and expressed himself,
[1:33:59] but he has given himself in a form
[1:34:01] today. And how is that? That's the son
[1:34:04] of man ministry, the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:08] the word for our day, taking it and
[1:34:10] eating it up and letting it actually
[1:34:13] become who we are.
[1:34:18] Improving his
[1:34:19] word. I think this is so beautiful.
[1:34:22] Brother says this, he was in the feet in
[1:34:25] Luther, in the thighs, in Wesley, in the
[1:34:27] shoulders in Pentecost. See what I mean?
[1:34:30] He is the head. You have a part that
[1:34:34] joins that
[1:34:35] together. This hour that we're living
[1:34:39] now, not the feet
[1:34:41] part, not the thigh
[1:34:44] part, not the shoulder
[1:34:46] part, but the neck
[1:34:49] part. Is that right?
[1:34:52] It joins to the
[1:34:54] head. That's the part of the body. And
[1:34:57] every time I
[1:34:58] I think about this and and read about it
[1:35:01] and consider it, I just can't help but
[1:35:04] think about how brother Menow Fzen
[1:35:08] talked about it. And he said, you know,
[1:35:10] in in that that that pyramid that's not
[1:35:14] capped, that capstone ministry that
[1:35:16] comes down to the pyramid that will fit
[1:35:18] exactly on top. It's exactly the same
[1:35:20] size, precisionely cut. That capstone
[1:35:25] ministry will be perfectly fit together.
[1:35:28] And there won't be any mortar between
[1:35:31] that capstone ministry and the body.
[1:35:35] When the head and the body come
[1:35:36] together, there will be no mortar.
[1:35:38] There's no joint. And we know that's the
[1:35:40] same in our lives, too. And I love how
[1:35:42] he uses this example. And we can say
[1:35:44] this is brother Brandham giving this
[1:35:46] example, but we know that this is a
[1:35:47] prophetic utterance by God through his
[1:35:49] prophet. He's giving us these examples
[1:35:51] for a reason so that we would understand
[1:35:53] it. So that the head thinks and the hand
[1:35:56] moves. The head thinks and the leg
[1:35:58] moves. And the head thinks and the mouth
[1:36:01] speaks. That's the way it the way it
[1:36:04] works. Excuse me.
[1:36:08] Brother Bradom, he says this. Is that
[1:36:10] right? It joins to the head. That's the
[1:36:14] part of the body. Those that are asleep
[1:36:16] in Jesus will God bring with him. The
[1:36:20] trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead
[1:36:23] in Christ shall rise first. Isn't that
[1:36:27] beautiful? We're so close, brothers and
[1:36:29] sisters. My is that right? See, you
[1:36:33] become a part of that
[1:36:36] word. You become a part of
[1:36:41] him and you take his
[1:36:44] name to recognize it. See, you're placed
[1:36:48] in there. Not just placed in there, not
[1:36:52] just positioned in there, right? We're
[1:36:55] baptized into his name, into his body.
[1:37:00] This is why it's so beautiful and it's
[1:37:02] this this scripture has to apply to
[1:37:05] every single believer and there's no way
[1:37:07] around this. There is no getting around
[1:37:10] this. There's no loopholes with this. I
[1:37:12] love it. By one
[1:37:14] spirit. What spirit is that? Is it the
[1:37:18] spirit of our church? Is it the spirit
[1:37:20] of the message? Is it the spirit of
[1:37:24] whatever? It's not. It's the spirit of
[1:37:27] Jesus Christ. It's the baptism of the
[1:37:30] Holy Ghost, the true baptism of the Holy
[1:37:32] Ghost. And that's why there's so much
[1:37:34] contention with the message of the hour
[1:37:36] today because just it's amazing how so
[1:37:40] many people, millions and billions of
[1:37:43] denominational folks, they want to say
[1:37:44] that there can be a triune baptism. You
[1:37:47] can be baptized in the name of the
[1:37:48] father and the name of the son, name of
[1:37:49] the holy ghost. And we know that that's
[1:37:51] in the scripture. But what is the name
[1:37:53] of each one of them? We know that's
[1:37:54] Jesus Christ. We've gone over that
[1:37:56] already. But why is that such a
[1:37:57] contentious thing about the message of
[1:37:59] the hour? The reason for it is you will
[1:38:03] not receive the true baptism of the Holy
[1:38:05] Ghost outside of following the word of
[1:38:07] God. And following the word of God is
[1:38:09] truly saying amen to the word. Amen.
[1:38:16] You're placed in there baptized into his
[1:38:19] name, into his body by one spirit. We
[1:38:24] are all baptized in one body into here.
[1:38:27] Just exactly like the same
[1:38:30] position. He never changes his
[1:38:33] way. Isn't that beautiful? Just like
[1:38:37] from the book of Acts, he never changes
[1:38:40] his way. When Peter preached that
[1:38:42] sermon, when they stumbled out like
[1:38:44] drunk people out of the upper room, he
[1:38:46] never changed his way. We know people
[1:38:49] have changed their way. The church ages
[1:38:51] changed their way. That antichrist
[1:38:53] spirit creeps in to the framework of the
[1:38:56] Christian church. How? We know we read
[1:38:59] all about it in the church age book.
[1:39:00] Through politics, through men trying to
[1:39:03] determine how the church ought to
[1:39:05] operate instead of allowing the
[1:39:07] leadership of the Holy Ghost to run the
[1:39:09] church.
[1:39:12] That that Antichrist spirit creeps in
[1:39:14] and causes the church to become
[1:39:17] lukewarm,
[1:39:19] formal, and powerless. Amen. Why? But he
[1:39:23] never changes his
[1:39:25] way. If how many believes the early
[1:39:28] church is in him? Let's see how many
[1:39:30] believes
[1:39:31] it. How were they baptized? All right.
[1:39:35] See, he's unchangeable God. And we know
[1:39:39] that in the Bible, that's the thing that
[1:39:40] brother Brandham brought out so many
[1:39:41] times. Show us in the Bible where
[1:39:43] someone was baptized in the book of Acts
[1:39:46] onwards where they were baptized in the
[1:39:48] name of the Father, Son, and the Holy
[1:39:50] Ghost.
[1:39:51] in a trinitarian baptism. It doesn't
[1:39:53] exist. It's not even in the word.
[1:40:01] But we know everyone's doing it, so it
[1:40:04] must be right.
[1:40:06] Right. Just like we could say a lot of
[1:40:09] things politically, everybody's doing
[1:40:11] it. And you know what? It can actually
[1:40:13] be become legal. So it must be okay,
[1:40:17] right? Paul said it. All things though
[1:40:21] all things are ex are are lawful they're
[1:40:24] not all expedient. It doesn't mean that
[1:40:26] it's actually going to be a good thing
[1:40:28] for us to do it.
[1:40:31] And we know uh some folks would say well
[1:40:34] you know a little wine for the stomach's
[1:40:36] sake and that can be even in and around
[1:40:39] the message. I know folks that do it and
[1:40:41] they want to do it and that's
[1:40:43] okay. You have to go as you're as you're
[1:40:46] led. You know, the word speaks expressly
[1:40:49] about drinking alcohol and in in a
[1:40:52] couple different ways, but we know what
[1:40:53] the prophet said. And uh I think it's
[1:40:56] it's so good because we all have to be
[1:41:00] led by the Holy Ghost. I think as soon
[1:41:02] as we start to instigate dos and don'ts,
[1:41:05] that's where we lose truly lose the
[1:41:08] leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:10] the the the do and don't that I would
[1:41:13] preach that I really will stand behind
[1:41:15] is get the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:18] Then he the Spirit of truth will lead us
[1:41:21] and guide us all into all truth.
[1:41:25] But as long as we want to try and adhere
[1:41:28] to some former teaching or some former
[1:41:30] theories, what's going to happen is
[1:41:32] we're going to ground the power of the
[1:41:34] Holy Ghost from being able to lead us.
[1:41:37] I know myself, I heard it said speaking
[1:41:39] about alcohol expressly, I I don't want
[1:41:42] my children to see a little bit of
[1:41:44] alcohol in my life.
[1:41:47] I just don't want them to see it. I
[1:41:48] don't think they need to see it. I don't
[1:41:50] think there's any need for
[1:41:51] alcohol. Some people might be
[1:41:54] disagreeing with me here, and that's
[1:41:55] okay. Some people might say, "Well,
[1:41:57] Brother Barry, you were delivered from
[1:41:59] it. You were an alcoholic, so you you
[1:42:01] just are afraid of it, and you're
[1:42:02] running from it." You know what? I'm not
[1:42:04] afraid of alcohol. I drink wine for
[1:42:06] communion and you know I drink as much
[1:42:08] as I want to. Just like cigarettes, I
[1:42:10] smoke just as much as I want to. Just
[1:42:12] like weed, cannabis, I could go to the
[1:42:15] the store and buy cannabis. I smoke as
[1:42:18] much of it as I want to. People are
[1:42:20] saying, "Brother Barry, why you saying
[1:42:21] that? You're being recorded. You're
[1:42:23] live. You know what? I don't do any of
[1:42:25] it." Because I don't want it.
[1:42:29] Once upon a time, I did want it. But you
[1:42:32] know what? I got baptized by the Holy
[1:42:34] Ghost. Amen.
[1:42:36] And it changed me. It made me into a new
[1:42:39] creature.
[1:42:43] Every one of us as elected sons and
[1:42:46] daughters of God, we
[1:42:49] will allow ourselves to be baptized with
[1:42:51] the Holy Ghost. We will just come in
[1:42:53] line with the word for our day. He says,
[1:42:55] "How how many believes it? How are they
[1:42:58] baptized?" All right. See, he's
[1:42:59] unchangeable God. We proved that. We
[1:43:02] could stay here till midnight tonight.
[1:43:04] proving that. Isn't that beautiful? We
[1:43:06] could do the same right now because he's
[1:43:07] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:43:10] I love it. We can stay here till
[1:43:11] midnight tonight proving that. And I
[1:43:14] know many people are saying, "Brother
[1:43:15] Barry, would you please just call the
[1:43:16] musicians?" So, I'll say, "Okay, I'll
[1:43:18] just call the musicians." We won't stay
[1:43:20] here till midnight. But as we close
[1:43:22] tonight, I want to say this, proving
[1:43:24] that. And still go on and on and on.
[1:43:27] See, unchangeable. See, you are in him
[1:43:31] and a part of him because you were a
[1:43:34] part of the thinking before thinking of
[1:43:37] him. Before the foundation of the world,
[1:43:39] he called you. Amen.
[1:43:43] Have you heard him call your
[1:43:45] name? Some people have and some people
[1:43:48] haven't. Some people are looking at me
[1:43:50] like, "That's crazy talk."
[1:43:53] Some people have heard him call your
[1:43:57] name. If he's called your
[1:44:01] name, you'll never be the same. The
[1:44:05] Bible said the beast upon the earth,
[1:44:07] that's the denominational antichrist
[1:44:08] coming on the earth, forming the beast
[1:44:10] at Rome, which was the first
[1:44:12] denomination. And this world council of
[1:44:15] churches forms an image unto the beast.
[1:44:19] And this this is actually happening.
[1:44:22] while we're speaking here
[1:44:24] tonight. Just exactly what we just put
[1:44:27] in the book there the other day. Notice
[1:44:29] it forms that see the antichrist. And
[1:44:33] the Bible said all whose names were not
[1:44:37] written on the lamb's book of
[1:44:40] life when at the
[1:44:42] revival slain before the foundation of
[1:44:45] the world. Your name was put
[1:44:48] there. This antichrist will deceive you.
[1:44:51] I remember as a little kid hearing about
[1:44:54] this the beast and the antichrist and
[1:44:57] thinking that there'll be people that
[1:44:58] will just be
[1:44:59] deceived. Brothers and sisters, outside
[1:45:02] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you
[1:45:03] will be deceived.
[1:45:06] I will be deceived outside of the
[1:45:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's how
[1:45:10] important it is because it will be so
[1:45:12] close that it will deceive the very
[1:45:14] elected. So, I want to say it tonight.
[1:45:16] It's not going to be out there. It's
[1:45:17] going to be right in here. Amen. The
[1:45:20] devil is going to be right in here. And
[1:45:22] you know how he's going to be in here?
[1:45:24] I'll tell you how. He's going to be
[1:45:26] right in here getting into people's
[1:45:28] minds and saying that brother Barry, he
[1:45:30] did this and that brother Barry, he
[1:45:32] didn't do that. And that brother Barry,
[1:45:34] that brother Barry, that brother Barry
[1:45:36] and then go and talk about that brother
[1:45:38] Barry. And that is the Antichrist
[1:45:40] spirit. And as long as we entertain it,
[1:45:43] he has a foothold. But when we're
[1:45:45] willing to say, "Not this time, Satan.
[1:45:49] cuz I've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:51] Ghost.
[1:45:53] If I've got a problem with Brother
[1:45:54] Barry, I'm going to go and knock on his
[1:45:56] door. Not going to send him a text. I'm
[1:45:58] not going to call him. I'm going to go
[1:46:00] to him like the word says. But that's
[1:46:03] the Antichrist spirit. Yes, it is.
[1:46:06] That's how it will be so close. Brothers
[1:46:08] and
[1:46:09] sisters, we're going to preach the word.
[1:46:11] I'm going to do everything I can to
[1:46:13] bring the word of God. I'm going to
[1:46:14] actually die trying to speak this true
[1:46:17] pure word of God. Even if it takes my
[1:46:21] hide off. So, it ain't going to be me
[1:46:24] bringing a false doctrine. That's not
[1:46:26] going to happen. It's going to be the
[1:46:29] devil trying to come to church to get in
[1:46:31] our minds.
[1:46:33] But we're not blinded.
[1:46:36] Other people have been blinded. We have
[1:46:38] been elected.
[1:46:40] Elected to know the word of God. He says
[1:46:43] that antichrist, the antichrist would be
[1:46:46] so close like the real thing in the last
[1:46:50] days. It would deceive the very elected
[1:46:53] or
[1:46:55] predestinated. It's the same thing.
[1:46:58] Election and predestination is the same
[1:47:01] thing. God elected you or predestinated
[1:47:04] you before the foundation of the
[1:47:07] world will deceive all whose names were
[1:47:13] not predestinated on the book of life.
[1:47:17] Not deceive all those who just don't
[1:47:19] actually come to church, who just don't
[1:47:21] actually get saved. All of those people
[1:47:23] who weren't elected before the
[1:47:25] foundation of the world. That's why
[1:47:28] stand with me as we close tonight. I I
[1:47:30] just can't help but think about how
[1:47:31] humbling this truly is. This revelation
[1:47:34] when it goes from being knowledge in our
[1:47:36] head to revelation in our heart about
[1:47:38] how God called us before the foundation
[1:47:40] of the world. There's nothing that we
[1:47:41] did except for realize it.
[1:47:49] My I'll stop. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:47:52] Gracious heavenly father, we're so
[1:47:54] thankful that we can call you our
[1:47:55] father. We're so thankful that we can
[1:47:58] call you Lord.
[1:48:00] Oh father, we don't want to just call
[1:48:02] you our savior. Many people in this
[1:48:05] world know you as savior but are afraid
[1:48:07] to call you their lord because that's
[1:48:10] rulership. And father, we want to submit
[1:48:13] all of our lives unto you tonight,
[1:48:15] Father. every area, Father. Our
[1:48:17] finances, Lord, our careers, oh Father,
[1:48:19] our families, our spouses, oh Father,
[1:48:22] all that we would ever think or do,
[1:48:24] Lord, help us to surrender it unto you
[1:48:27] tonight, Father, that you would be Lord
[1:48:29] of all. That we would have no
[1:48:31] reservations, Lord Jesus, thinking that
[1:48:33] I'm just going to do it my way. I'm just
[1:48:35] going to do it the way that I feel, the
[1:48:38] way that I think. Oh, Father, let us all
[1:48:40] humble ourselves in your sight that you
[1:48:43] could pick us up, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:46] Father, tonight I pray that Lord, if
[1:48:48] there's anybody here that is desiring to
[1:48:50] to partake of the true baptism of your
[1:48:53] Holy Spirit, Lord, that you would just
[1:48:55] come on the scene and that you would
[1:48:57] prove your word to that person tonight,
[1:48:59] Lord. Father, that they would be able to
[1:49:02] see you in the power of your
[1:49:04] resurrection like they've never seen you
[1:49:06] before.
[1:49:07] Oh, Father, Lord, if there's any of of
[1:49:10] us here tonight, Lord, myself included,
[1:49:12] that just needs a little more of you,
[1:49:14] Father. Oh, Lord, I pray that you would
[1:49:17] just fill our cups, Lord, as we lift
[1:49:19] them up unto you tonight, Lord. Let us
[1:49:21] not leave this building tonight without
[1:49:23] knowing that we've heard from you once
[1:49:25] again, Lord. Father, we know that you
[1:49:27] are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:49:29] forever. And if you've ever met us on
[1:49:31] these grounds once, Father, tonight we
[1:49:34] just want to come on these same sacred
[1:49:36] grounds. Lord, take off our shoes and
[1:49:38] reverence ourselves in your sight, Lord.
[1:49:41] Father, tonight we pray that you would
[1:49:42] be with those who aren't here tonight,
[1:49:44] Lord. Some traveling, some at home,
[1:49:46] maybe working. Father, whatever the
[1:49:48] case, we pray that you would bless them
[1:49:50] abundantly as well. Father, Lord, we
[1:49:53] love you and we thank you and we just
[1:49:55] commit all the words that were said
[1:49:56] tonight into your hands.
[1:49:59] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:50:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:09] We've been made more than
[1:50:12] conquerors. We've been made more than
[1:50:20] coner.
[1:50:22] Overcomers in this
[1:50:27] life. We've been
[1:50:30] made victorious.
[1:50:35] us through the blood of Jesus
[1:50:39] Christ called before the
[1:50:42] foundation. We've been made more than
[1:50:49] coner
[1:50:51] overcomers in this
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:56] life. We've been made
[1:51:02] victorious.
[1:51:04] us through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:09] We've been made, we didn't do it. We've
[1:51:12] been made more than
[1:51:16] coner. Thank you,
[1:51:18] Lord.
[1:51:20] Overcomers in this
[1:51:25] life. We've been made victorious.
[1:51:33] us through the blood of Jesus
[1:51:38] Christ. Can we sing that song? Jesus
[1:51:41] be the Lord of
[1:51:45] all. Jesus be the Lord of
[1:51:51] all. Jesus
[1:51:54] be the Lord.
[1:52:00] Jesus
[1:52:02] be the
[1:52:04] Lord of
[1:52:06] all. Jesus
[1:52:09] be the Lord of
[1:52:13] all the
[1:52:16] kingoms of my heart.
[1:52:20] [Music]
[1:52:23] Jesus
[1:52:25] I
[1:52:26] surrender
[1:52:29] all. Jesus
[1:52:32] I
[1:52:34] surrender all.
[1:52:37] Jesus,
[1:52:39] I
[1:52:41] surrender
[1:52:43] all the
[1:52:45] kingoms of my
[1:52:51] heart.
[1:52:53] Amen. Can we sing the potter's hand
[1:52:56] tonight?
[1:52:58] Beautiful
[1:53:00] Lord. Wonderful
[1:53:03] Savior. Beautiful
[1:53:05] Lord. Wonderful
[1:53:09] Savior. I know for
[1:53:12] sure that all of my days are held in
[1:53:18] your
[1:53:19] hands. They're crafted
[1:53:23] into your perfect
[1:53:28] plan. And do you know that
[1:53:31] tonight you gently call
[1:53:34] me into your
[1:53:38] presence, guiding me
[1:53:42] by your Holy
[1:53:45] Spirit. Teach me, dear
[1:53:48] Lord, to live all my
[1:53:52] life
[1:53:54] through
[1:53:56] your eyes.
[1:53:59] eyes. Oh, I'm captured
[1:54:03] by your holy
[1:54:06] calling. You've set me
[1:54:09] aart, Lord. I know you're
[1:54:14] drawing me to
[1:54:17] yourself. Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[1:54:29] Take me. God bless you
[1:54:32] tonight. Hold
[1:54:35] me. Use
[1:54:39] me. Fill
