one more time we don't know how many more times we will do this on this side of Eternity what an opportunity to gather together in the name above every name we heard it this morning resoundingly the name of Jesus Christ what a tremendous thing we just have a couple of requests today that we would like to bring before the church like to remember Sister snow she has I guess a tremendous stomach problem it's good to see you here brother Don just want to remember her bring her before the Lord that the Lord would just touch her and heal her body I'd like to remember Sister Mary Carpenter she has been diagnosed with a doctor saying she needs a new knee and I believe her confession is that the Lord could do that for her we want to remember her niece Ariana at the loss of her fiance and uh sister Shelley would just like to thank everyone for the prayers for uh sister Marlene Barker she's feeling a lot better these days the Lord has touched her and she said specifically that she has felt the prayers so she wanted to thank the church herself so God bless you Sister Shelley what a tremendous witness if you have a need this morning make it and maybe make it known with an uplift hand as

want to remember her niece Ariana Lord God at the loss of her nephew father we can't explain things naturally many times in this world but we know that you have all things under your control and father we just trust you that way we just pray that you would be her Comfort Lord that you would Lord raise her up and allow her father to see that there is a life to live here on this side and father

building today the same way that we came in but father change us father one more time from glory to glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen bless you this morning musicians thank you if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Mark chapter 10. verse 17 to 22. likely a very familiar scripture it's just a beautiful thing I believe the direction of the Lord and his leadership is such a wonderful thing Mark chapter 10. we'll start reading with verse 17. you have it say Amen this morning says and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked God asked him sorry good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God Jesus speaking here continuing on in verse 19 says to him thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he said and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions let's just bow in prayer one more time a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we thank you Father that you always come father that you always lead us father that you always give us the direction that we need in our lives and it's up to us whether we choose to accept it or reject it father this morning we pray that you would just take this bread of life that we've read now that you would break it open fresh to us father that you would Enlighten our eyes father of understanding today Lord Jesus that you would just have your will and your way in this service we ask all these things now when Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just uh a few announcements before we get into the word this morning November calendar will be out this week not really much has changed um from what we do normally we'll be having the fellowship on the 31st which is tomorrow that's at our place for those people who feel inclined to come I'm sure it'll be a wonderful time a good opportunity to get together as friends and Families on November the 9th and I'll say November the 23rd kind of jumping ahead we're going to do something a little differently moving forwards and that's uh I've invited our ministering Brethren to take part in our services on Wednesdays so we're going to have our ministering ministering Brothers take two Services a month um for the next while just to see what the Lord will do it's important for us as ministers to be able to release we drink in a lot and we have to be able to push out and if we're not given that opportunity it can become problematic so we want to see the Lord move in our brother's life so we have brother Gilbert taking the service on the 9th of November and we have brother Emanuel taking the service on the 23rd of November and we'll have brother Toby yeah we'll have the other two brothers take Services brother Mervin and brother Toby in December but uh for now we'll have those two brothers in November we have the Men's breakfast coming up November the 12th we have a November Youth Event I believe that's on the 18th that's the third Friday then we have November the 20th we're going to have a communion service November the 23rd I already said brother Emanuel and November the 26th we're going to have a youth banquet and brother Toby is going to take that banquet for us which is a tremendous opportunity to maybe hear what the Lord has put on our brother's heart and to see what the Lord can do in the heart of a Believer I believe that when we get together with the youth like this we're not speaking to um unbelieving youth we're speaking to youth who are believers and there really is nothing better than to hear a real experience of a believing youth and you know many times we can look at it and say you know if if someone is a Believer and and they step away from the word and and maybe they deny their own testimony from the perception that we have perhaps they're an unbeliever at that time that's not true a Believer is a believer and sometimes we just actually get out of our position that's what happens but it doesn't change Who We Are and I believe brother Toby has a powerful testimony for the Youth it's incredible to look at it and understand that the Lord will use anyone anytime anywhere and uh just because maybe it looks like our youth is going Wayward remember we talked about this brother Branham said don't call them Renegades they're not Renegades they're our children they're the best children on the planet because they're ours and we apply the token to our homes so we have youth banquet on the 26th whether Toby's going to take that and uh we're certainly excited to see what the Lord will do we had an amazing time of Fellowship yesterday at the Men's breakfast in Edmonton we had uh four of the brothers go up with me and it was just tremendous to hear how the Lord moves in people's lives there was uh it was a testimony service just to hear what the Lord Has Done in in our brothers lives and a brother from Tennessee brother Tim Calhoun he took the the Lion's Share of the of the meeting but we had three other brothers give their testimonies and brother Mervin was invited to speak as well and he didn't really give his testimony he just preached he's an evangelist he can't help it he he just pulled the pin and and let him have it and it was wonderful it was really good but we uh you know we heard a testimony yesterday one testimony I thought was in particular it was so good the brother was African and and he just said you know there was a time in his life where he had to come face to face with the pillar of fire himself he was raised in a Christian Church in a message church and he got married under the message Banner he married a message girl and and he was all about the message but there came a point in time where he actually had to meet the pillar of fire for himself often what he did was he recognized that there ain't no culture in Christ there's no African culture in the Holy Ghost there's no North American culture in the Holy Ghost this is what this brother was saying it was powerful to hear what he had to say he said he had to forget everything that he knew and get into Christ all of the traditional teachings to say that I have the ability to behave this way because of my culture because of where I come from and the way everyone over there does it and that over there could be maybe in Canada just in another another location you know what the other brother said is the North American culture is the worst he said that and why is that because we're rich increased with goods and we come to the place where we believe we have need of nothing I have the message of the hour I've got the message up I've got all the message books I've even gone to Jeffersonville but what good is it if you haven't met the pillar of fire yourself and that's what he got at yesterday it was powerful so if anyone's interested I've got the recordings and I can certainly just WhatsApp them to you if you want to hear them and you'll be able to hear brother Victor he uh he's a brother in Edmonton a powerful testimony really good and and you know the fellowship just going up and coming back was just equally as good spending time with the brothers and just no pressures of life it was just wonderful so God bless you each one for for coming thank you for the wives the families to sacrifice your husbands for the day I think it was just a wonderful opportunity to to get together and fellowship around the things of the Lord you know to to go to another location and just to hear the Brethren speak and and to know that well we all come from different backgrounds different places and just to hear what the Lord has put on on the heart of the Believers is just tremendous you happy this morning certainly excited to see what the Lord has in store today we're talking about the Rich Young Ruler out of the message leadership and uh it's kind of from that thought that I had last week and we'll just see what the Lord will do as we go forwards it might be a few weeks it might just end today I don't know we just want to trust the Lord and follow him we want his leadership it's got to be his leadership but you know uh the thought about communion and Leadership and and we can't have communion true communion with the Lord unless we're willing to be led if we're not willing to be led then we can't truly have communion it's just the way it works this Young Ruler here the Rich Young Ruler he had done everything he kept everything right in his life he was perfectly Polished in the scripture we just read it we know it everything was correct in his life all of of his behavior was right in line with the word call it the message of the hour for his day he was right in line with it but when he came to that place in his life where he met the pillar of fire himself he had the opportunity to say ah I'm gonna forget all I know and follow your instructions or I'm gonna just be sad and walk away and say I just assume there's no way I can't walk away from everything that I think I know all of my behaviors everything that I do is fine he was positionally placed he was in that position to meet the pillar of fire himself the Lord Jesus Christ and here we go talking about it again the punch line brothers and sisters we've got to be willing to come to that Pillar of Fire ourselves and when we come and we actually meet that Pillar of Fire ourselves himself we're faced with a choice to take what we think we know and go forwards or to take what he tells us to do and forget all we know and just go forwards and you know unless we're willing to actually do that unless we're willing to let go of all of our preconceived notions and our teachings and our ideologies and you know we heard Brothers talking about it our family idols what can a family Idol be maybe it's a teaching that we were given that doesn't line up with the message of the hour if we're willing to say I'm willing to keep that teaching and mix it with the message that becomes a family Idol it can be getting between us and God and and if we can't match it up with the message of the hour or the word we just need to let it go just set it down don't worry about it you don't have to make a big deal about it you don't have to go to your family and try and say this is wrong I'm going to have a fight because I've learned the word of God says something different no just set it down just just set it down and go forwards but here we have this Rich Young Ruler he was raised according to the word for his day brother Bradham and the message leadership it was the second last recorded message that brother Branham uh preached is is where I'm coming from this morning leadership and and then the next message right after that was communion you've got to be willing to be led in order to have communion with the Lord and we talked a little bit about it last week I'll do a quick recap as we go forwards but in the beginning of this message brother Branham he says his text is follow me follow me and the subject is actually leadership so that message is called leadership but he's saying the subject is follow me and he says I want to approach it from a different way I think it's just beautiful to to look at it that way to to maybe take a step backwards and say maybe I can just take a look at it from a different angle maybe just a different way and and see what the prophet of God has to say about it we can't just say that I I have done it once and and it's once and for all and and it's good even though when we're sealed we're sealed until the day of our Redemption this is where it can become very confusing in a paradox we heard the brother say it yesterday you know unless we're willing to actually die out to ourselves every single day of Our Lives we're in trouble we've got to be willing to die out to ourselves every single day of our lives and we have to do it we have to have that that leadership where we can have that true communion in our lives but true leadership of the Holy Ghost leads us to communion leads us to that desire to get on our knees that desire to pray continuously that desire to just be in fellowship with the Saints you know being led of his Spirit takes us and and positionally placed Us in in our promised land in our inheritance and that's why we say we need to get the Holy Ghost we need to cross over Jordan we need to make sure that we understand what it means to cross over Jordan again in our Promised Land we've talked about that um a long time the children of Israel being able to cross over and it wasn't just so that they could cross over and say praise the Lord I've crossed over I've come out of bondage and and here I am I'm in the promised land even though they could say that but we know there is a time in Joshua where he went to those seven tribes that did not do anything they were just over there they helped their brothers they were really good workers and they got everyone positionally placed but they themselves weren't there yet and Joshua Jehovah savior the Holy Ghost came around and said to them how long are you going to be slack in going forwards to possess your promise I think it's wonderful because I believe that's the job of the fivefold ministry today to encourage people to keep going don't just settle don't just stop don't just get tired and and say I've gone as far as I can go and I can't go any farther we got to go all the way brothers and sisters and we're not willing to leave any behind but we're looking at getting into our positions and our positions isn't a position in a church to say that I've got a church office or I've been in a church for a certain amount of time it's not about that it's about getting into our position in Christ Jesus we sang the songs of Zion this morning about Jesus the name of Jesus that's our ultimate goal God bless you brother Faron for being led of the spirit to take us and lead us through the songs of worship about Jesus because there's one name that Satan hates and that's the name of Jesus but you know brothers and sisters if we can say that name and something inside of us resounds then we've got something to Rejoice about we have something to Rejoice about because we are being positionally placed in our inheritance and you know taking that a little bit further we talked about it last week I believe and we've been talking about it on Wednesdays and our position in Christ Jesus brothers and sisters is coming to church and is recognizing the message of the hour but where is our position in our families are we living in our families according to the word of God because if we're not then are we truly positioned in Christ our position in our family is so incredibly important and we said this before brothers and sisters the devil is roaming around as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and I can promise every single one of us who have children the devil wants your children and he's going to do everything he can to get us out of order out of our position so that we don't have that token on display in our lives but if we can keep that token on display and stay in our position and maybe if we're not in our position get in our position then Satan won't have any success in our lives in our families you know we're talking about our position in Christ but it comes down to our position in our families and then it goes a little further to our position in the body and sometimes we can have one of those positions but maybe not the other two or maybe two and not the other one but you know to have all of that to be positionally placed in Christ we need to have our position in every one of those and maybe we don't find ourselves in a position where I'm exactly where I want to be but you know we need to know that in our heart of hearts we're striving to get into that position because that's what God's looking for he's not looking for someone who's perfectly Polished Church isn't for the perfectly refined individual church is for the broken people churches for the ones that really need help I remember when I was in the world I looked at people that went to church and I said they're losers they're weak because they can't stand on their own but truly they're not they're the ones that recognize there's no hope in this world this world is empty and this world has no mercy because this world is controlled by Satan and if you choose to reject the word of God then you're going to be chewed up and spit out we're going to fight all of our way to either go to hell or we're gonna fight our way to go to heaven but we can choose we are given the opportunity to meet with that Pillar of Fire in our own lives and when we do get that choice our choice determines whether we can actually have true communion with him and boy if we can have true communion with him then there ain't nothing that can rattle us you can see people who have true communion with the Lord they're happy nothing can rattle them nothing can shake them because they're willing to be led but you know when we're not willing to be led when we say no I've got it it's good then you know it's troubling you can't have true communion we can have communion but you know look at Abraham look at the story of Abraham he was told to come out of his family we talked about this last week Abraham had to come out of his his Kindred his family had to leave it all behind he was a gentile but he is also a Hebrew the word says that he was a Hebrew he came out and actually had communion because he was willing to follow the leadership of the Lord to forget all that he knew and we know we talked about it before as well it goes on for communion and and to having communion in in the upper room with Melchizedek again because we know Melchizedek was Christ Melchizedek was the amorphous God and morphe changing his mask brother Branham talks about it and who is this Melchizedek he wasn't just another man he wasn't an ordinary man the word says that he was without father and he was without mother he was without beginning of days or ending of life he was without dissent who is that that's God himself the high priest of our confessions and he's willing to come and give us communion himself and I think it's so powerful when we can look at it brothers and sisters when we're faced with a communion service we can come and actually receive true communion by the leadership of the Lord in our lives it's not the leadership of a man it's an ordinance that God gave to the church to the Christian church today this generation to actually be served the bread and the wine to denote the victory in the Battle of overcoming being able to overcome your own will and fight you all of the enemy and actually bring back those who need to come back and you know really what we need to do is just recognize that we're the ones that need to come back we're the ones that need communion we're the ones that need leadership we're the ones that need the help it's not perfect individuals well we have a community service so that we can come and receive communion from Melchizedek now it might be crazy for me to say it that way but I just can't help but say it that way because brothers and sisters if you're coming to receive communion from the deacons you're coming for the wrong reasons communion service is about following the ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ to recognize that we have the battles in our lives but we've been given a victory in those battles in our lives because we have the token we've been given the Holy Ghost in our day we've been given the direction through the prophet for our day the message of Malachi 4 to repent for our sins and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins so that we can receive the Holy Ghost true Christian baptism Acts 2 38 not coming according to get baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost because those are titles it's a trick of the devil it's a doctrine of devils brother Branham says it's from Hell the trinitarian doctrine there's nowhere in the Bible it says to get baptized that way but anyways we have a community service for a purpose and that is so that we can come and declare our victory in what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us we come and and and have a communion service because we know what he's done for us we're not interested in letting Satan Rob us of that opportunity to have a victory in our lives because you know what happens you know what happens every one of you I believe has been a part of a communion service and if you haven't been I recommend you try it because if you haven't experienced it when you leave this building you have a victory in your life there's something that happens in your life Supernatural through a communion service one of them is you're coming to outwardly express your willingness to accept his body that was broken for you the other one is your willingness to accept the blood that was shed for you the other one is your willingness to come and humble yourself before your brother your sister and wash their feet to recognize that that's deity in flesh and boy when you can humble yourself in all three of those ways something Supernatural takes place in your life I would say this Melchizedek serves you communion at that point and that's why we don't leave here the same after a communion service but it's a we know that it's a it's a it's a demonstration of the last supper and we read the scripture many times but the communion service there's a very important part of our Lives as a Christian believer for today a communion service really according to William Miriam Bradham isn't optional it's not something that we just put off and say you know I'll just do it when I feel like it and you know I just don't feel like it now so I just won't do it you know what when we don't feel like it that means there's an indicator there's a red flag going off and you know what I'll say is that red flag is the Holy Ghost In Our Lives saying that hey there's something not right and you got to make it right so that you can come to that table but if you're not willing to make it right what's going to happen is that voice is slowly going to get quieter and quieter and quieter and quieter and quieter and eventually that voice won't even sound you won't even hear that voice and you'll be able to say hey you know what I don't I don't need to go to communion Services let's at me I'm doing okay everything in my life is just fine but is it fine do you still hear that voice Abraham accepted that leadership in his life in Genesis 12 1-4 and we know that he took lot he took lot out of his family this is just sort of recapping and lot was a penny brother Bonham said and Abraham was a silver dollar and and even though Abraham recognized he was just a penny he was still a part of God's economy and we know through the leadership of the Lord he understood that that lot his nephew had been taken even though he'd brought him out he felt responsible for him so he went after him and it was after that he brought lot out that he was actually served communion by Melchizedek he came God himself came and served him communion and I can only imagine in that time Melchizedek might have said to him and oh by the way this is just me talking here this isn't the Prophet this is anybody else this is just me but I believe he actually could have heard Melchizedek say to him and oh by the way as soon as you're willing to separate yourself from your nephew then we'll get back to business because after he brought lot out it wasn't until after he separated till the herdsmen had Strife until there was a problem until they separated that God came back and spoke to Abraham again according to the scripture here Abraham didn't hear until they parted ways but he was given the opportunity to go and save his nephew so that he could be served communion you know brother Bradham in in communion the importance of communion he says now in other words don't just come and take it as as I said a while ago about what the Jews their sacrifice they it was wonderful it was given by God but it got to a place where they didn't do it in sincerity and reverence and in order and it become it just become as tension as nose and you know what that is is when we just come to the communion table and we just do it because it's just what we do it's just on the calendar so we just come and do it and everything is good in our lives and sometimes that's what we need to do we just need to drag it and do it even though we don't really feel it and you know I would say personally that's Sometimes the best time but we do need to recognize the importance of communion and not make it something that we're just doing just because we're just told to do it we need to recognize the importance of it when we come to a communion service don't look at the deacons serving it look at them and see Melchizedek look at them and see the Lord Jesus Christ this is the one whose body was broken for me this is the one whose blood this represents that I'm partaking of I'm consuming this because this is a part of him and I am truly a part of him and I'm willing to recognize it brother Branham says they did it since without sincerity and evidence reverence in an order then it becomes just a stench in his nose now the same thing is by our coming to take the Lord's Supper that we must know we must come knowing what we are doing we like when you go to the water to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know what you're doing he says you're putting on to the church what God has put in you Christ when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe that he is the bread of life that's come from God out of heaven I believe every word that he says is truth and I live by it to the best of my knowledge God being my judge therefore before my brothers before my sisters I just think this is so powerful brothers and sisters he says I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears me record therefore before you I take the parcel of his body to know that I am not condemned with the world see there you are then it's a blessing and I I know it for sure brothers and sisters well I'm talking about just coming to have communion because it's just on the calendar I'm guilty I'm not saying it because I think there's people out here I just know that I've lived that and I can only preach from where I've lived I've done it because I thought that maybe I'm a little holier than thou I can come to a communion service and some people can't you know what both of those are just is wrong not one of those is Right we've got to come with the right attitude the right mental attitude and here we have the prophet of God giving us the pattern for that attitude we've got to be willing to come to accept what the Lord has done for us therefore before you I take this parcel of body to know that I am not condemned with the world there you are then it's a blessing he says and remember I could give many testimonies on this where I've I've I've took took that and explained it in a sick room and seen them healed remember when Israel taken the type of this they had journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and the clothes never even wore out and they come out with one feeble one one among them with two million people as a type of this well what will the anti-type do this is just where it's it just uh in my mind it's like it goes nuclear that's Israel they lived in the wilderness for 40 years and not one of them was feeble not one of them had their clothing wear out and that was under the blood of bulls and goats that was under the blood of a sacrifice and here we live under the blood of Jesus Christ he says well what will the anti-type do if the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them what will the body of Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us let's just be reverent when we come let us be just as reverent as we know how to come and I believe that's the end of that message brother branham's final words giving them to the Bride of Jesus Christ let's just be reverent brothers and sisters if you haven't experienced a communion service tonight is a communion service you have the opportunity and God knows God knows our hearts you know talking about leadership though in order to come to that place where we can have communion we've got to be led brother Branham talks about in this message leadership every single human being on Earth has to be led you come into the world being led by your mother by a good mother a good Godly mother is going to lead us in the way that we should go and as we actually get to the place where we can't help ourselves in in the end of our lives our bodies become feeble we're going excuse me we're going to have someone who is going to to lead us we all will be led in the middle we're taught in this world not to be led no we're taught to be strong and Lead our own lives and do our own things especially as the men the heads of the homes we can do what we want to do but we can do it so long as it lines up with the word of God brother random talks about the story of the the squirrel hunting in this in this message leadership and it's just a wonderful story he talks about the the old Infidel up on the hill there and how they they go along and and and they go and and drive to this place and his brother jumps out and and goes over and talks to him he tells brother Branham this man is a real Infidel and he does not like preachers and we know the story really well and he goes and and he's talking to this this brother Brown gets out of the car and goes over and starts talking to this Infidel and they have that exchange he says oh you're a minister are you he says well you're barking up the wrong tree and and he's meaning that in in the way that they're actually as a minister you're looking at the wrong place he says it's a lying dog and if you're barking up the wrong tree then you're looking in the wrong place and and this Infidel is trying to tell brother Branham that and brother Branham says you know you're welcome to your own opinion but he knew that he had already met that Pillar of Fire and that this man had just never met the same Pillar of Fire but he knew in the moment that this man was about to meet the pillar of Fire but here he tells him he's barking up the wrong tree but he says to him you know there's one man one man that I heard about one time if I could ever get a chance to talk to him how many times in our lives do we have that one desire just one not two not three just one desire to talk to that one person that would give us truly the answer that we're looking for he says there's one man I'd sure like to talk to and he goes on to explain how the old woman so and so up on the hill he says to brother Bradham I've been here for 70 years in these Hills all around and I've looked all around and I've looked for God and I just don't see him anywhere and brother Branham says well I guess it depends on what you're looking for and the same thing for us brothers and sisters what are we looking for today are we looking for a prophet to come back to finish something off are we are we looking for another messenger not the same Prophet uh what are we looking for brother we know Jesus said to them what did you go out into the Wilderness to see a a man in in soft Raymond in a fluffy cloak what are we looking for today in our lives that woman he says that woman so and so was up on the hill and how one day he heard her screaming and shouting and and they knew that she was sick with the cancer and and he said you know we thought the Salvation Army was up there there was so much screaming and yelling going on and he said well I guess we'll we'll have to it was in the evening time of course but I guess we'll have to get the wagon and go up in the morning they're about a mile up the hill and they were going to go and take the the body of the woman out to the main road the human mind just has an understanding that is not the same as the supernatural Vindicated power of God that we have but he tells this story about her screaming and yelling and and the beauty of it is in the morning they went out to get the wagon and they went up there to get the dead woman and he says you know I just couldn't believe it because we found this woman that we were assuming was dead that's why they were screaming and mourning and yelling but it was screaming and yelling Joy and what did they find they found her sitting there in a right mind eating fried apple pie from from dying of cancer to die any moment suddenly she's there eating fried apple pie brother Branham listening to this man this man said to him you know I'd sure like to find out what it was I'd like to talk to that man that was there and brother Branham had already had the discussion with him about what the intelligence is that tells the sap that's in the trees to leave the leaves and shoot down into the roots what intelligence is it that speaks to the trees and tells them to go and hide in the roots hide that life in the roots for winter so that you don't die that man says it's just nature it's just nature whether Bradham says okay if it's just nature then just take a bucket of water and put a stick in it and and see if that water goes up and down that stick if it's just nature it should do the same thing he says there's an intelligence behind it and that man says oh you might you might have something there brother Branham says yeah and he says you know if you can tell me when I come back what intelligence tells those leaves to go up and down I'll tell you it's the same intelligence that told me to go and heal that woman up on the hill there to pray for her and that man says you and he says would you recognize the name and he says yes we're all familiar with this this story it's such a powerful story but he says I led that old man to the Lord right there he could have said oh he's an Infidel we can't hunt over there I was just thinking about it how easy it would be to just simply dismiss the whole entire situation and miss the beauty of the leadership of the Lord in that situation and isn't it interesting because the natural circumstance to just go and hunt and have fun was actually the leadership of the Lord great so if you've never gone hunting let's go hunting you can have some really good Fellowship when you get outside of the city and you get out into the Hills brothers and sisters and you know I'll say this for me myself hunting is nice the meat is nice but the fellowship is what it's all about same thing about fishing it's the same thing if you ever want to go fishing maybe when it's yeah you know you could go fishing in the winter too I was going to say when it's nice out we can go fishing in the summertime but you can walk on water here in the winter if you want to but we all need leadership in our lives brothers and sisters not one of us can do it without and that's why this world is set up the way it is it's absolutely contrary to the word of God we all need leadership and there comes a point in time in every one of our lives where we will meet the Lord Jesus Christ for himself and and we know that he's going to take us and he's going to call us and he's going to say you know I love everything about you but there's just this one thing and you know nobody can say in our lives what that one thing is only you can say what that one thing that he tells you about in your life but when he tells you about it you're faced with that up opportunity to accept it or to reject it and you know many times that opportunity comes in just a regular ordinary service I know for me it came on a regular ordinary Wednesday night service and I think about it what would happen if I just didn't come to church on a Wednesday night service I would have missed that Pillar of Fire in my life brothers and sisters there's so many opportunities in our lives to come to service to actually meet with the pillar of fire if we're coming to church to hear from the brother you're coming to church for the wrong reasons God uses human beings we know that he we know that he's got a five-fold Ministry there's there's the brothers we know that he uses all of that but brothers and sisters what's the intelligence behind those Brothers it's got to be more than just something that they've learned it's got to be more than just the office they hold it's got to be more than who they are it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ it's got to be the Lord that leads us you know right now today we're all being led whether we know it or not you might say brother Barry I've got things under control of my life well we're either being led by God or we're being led by Satan and you know it's a constant battle to be led by one or the other and that's the Paradox about it we're being led by one or the other out of leadership brother Bradham talks about this he says that's the same thing that this boy was confronted with he come in he had been a member maybe of the Pharisees or Sadducees or some great order of that day he was religious as he could be he says I I observed these Commandments I've been taught since I was a youth see and Jesus he loved him for it we read that Jesus loved him Jesus turned and beholding him loved him he didn't despise him but we know the story it goes further to say that there's a point in time where he lifted up his eyes in hell he didn't lift up his eyes in the Abraham in the bosom of Abraham like the beggar he was as religious as could be he said I've observed these Commandments I've been taught since I was a youth see and Jesus loved him for it brother Brown speaking he says but he refused to be guided he refused to be guided he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life I'm saying this with respect to this brothers and sisters our leadership can't be a church our church points to Jesus Christ we have got to meet the pillar of fire ourselves amen we have got to say I I know brother Barry's a good brother and I appreciate all that he says but but I want to hear what Jesus Christ has to say to me today because when we come to church with that attitude in our heart brothers and sisters brother Barry is going to step aside from the things that he thought that he prepared to talk about and he's going to start to speak to needs it's not going to be Barry Johnson it's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ the pillar of Fire but if we refuse to accept leadership in our lives and we say no I know the message of the hour and I know brother Barry's parents I know his wife and I know his his in-laws I I know all of his faults and his failures I don't know why I'm doing this forgive me but if we do that brothers and sisters we're not going to receive the leadership of the Holy Ghost because this is the format that he's given us it's amazing to look at I don't make myself anyone I would say I'm the chiefest of Sinners here and I don't I don't I don't I don't even I feel like I don't even qualify to be here but you know what he chose it so the only thing that I can do is follow I know when that leadership comes brothers and sisters I learned that much in my life I'm not an educated man but I I know that when you meet that Pillar of Fire and he gives you a direction you've got to follow it and and I say that hey I still am learning to follow it because I know that he's leading me and I know that he's guiding me and there's things in my life that I still need to get right that aren't right and and it's just the way it is we're all humans and we're all growing and evolving but you know what if we're not growing and evolving we're dying we either have to be going forwards or we're going backwards in the Christian Walk we're not just standing still if we're just standing still we're going to get it but this boy he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life he says notice he believed there was something different than what he had or he would have never said good Master what must I do now he knew there was something more he knew it he had been taught but he didn't appreciate what Jesus told him because all of his natural understanding now he had to let go of he had to say nope all of my family business I have to set it aside oh no all of the wealth that I've amassed he said to me lay it down because remember brothers and sisters the love of money is the root of all evil he goes on to say this notice he believed there was something different that he had or he would have never said good Master what must I do now see he wanted to do something himself he didn't want to accept the leadership that was given to him he was given the leadership Jesus Christ himself the word made flesh and dwelling among them was giving him Direction in his day see he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do that's that's what we that's sorry he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do we want to do something ourself the gift of God is a free gift God give it to you you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see I love that there's nothing that we're going to do to stop it the only thing that we're going to do is maybe avoid some bumpy roads along the way to get there as Believers but today in our lives brothers and sisters I can't help but think it how do we do we do we follow the leadership of the word in our lives and our families in our church at our jobs and and we know that we've talked about this and I probably mentioned it last week but I'm mentioning it again how in in Wednesdays we've talked about this Ephesians lays out the pattern for husbands wives and children and even employees we have the ability to apply this in our lives you know it's impossible it's possible as an employee to actually not be living our life according to the word of God if we waste time as an employee if we talk back to our masters our our bosses if we talk bad about them are we serving God we're not maybe we are but we're not pleasing them you know we talked about First Corinthians chapter 13 being a spiritual barometer if we want to check in once in a while and see how we're doing in our lives as a husband as a wife as a child as a student as an employee we have the opportunity to do that to see if we have those attributes living out in our lives this right Rich Young Ruler brother Branham talks about them he was a young businessman and and he had a real belief he he he had Jesus beholding him and loving him he was brought up right by his parents and taught right according to the word for his day but he knew he did not possess eternal life is what brother Branham said he he said to him not what should I stop doing what should I do and I think it's so critical to recognize how how brother Branham talks about this in the second last message of his life he doesn't say what should I stop doing what should I do is what he says as Believers of this message of the hour brothers and sisters I think that we ought to stop looking at what have we done in the past what should we stop doing and start pressing towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and say what must I do to inherit the kingdom of God what must I do to see the full manifestation of this word in my life what must I do to have that Pillar of Fire walking with me in my life get that Pillar of Fire to just come down and actually burn out all of the old me so that that old me is no longer driving me that old me just goes to a position of influence it's not the position of author Authority in my life but if we're not willing to actually meet that Pillar of Fire face to face and have that real honest conversation that can never happen that leadership of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives will always be just right there it'll be just right there but it might not be all the way and what we saw that yesterday brother Mervin brought it up on the screen it was beautiful I I would like to get some of those Graphics brother right now I should have asked you about it but he brought up the graphic of the the body and the spirit and the soul the three circles and how sometimes we can just go and get stuck in the justification and then the sanctification we can get to that place where the Holy Ghost gets into our spirit it goes beyond our body we don't drink we don't smoke we don't party we don't listen to music we don't watch movies where everything in our life is good we get into our spirit and we get as far as our spirit our intellect and our reasoning and that's where we stop with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with that Pillar of Fire but if we don't go all the way into our soul brothers and sisters it doesn't become an inside job and it's got to go all the way down to our souls if it doesn't get in our souls then it doesn't change us the weight Right Way something will be able to shake us somewhere along the way someone will offend us something will offend us and before long it won't work out we'll we'll wind up in a situation that won't be good but when it gets into our very Souls nothing will shake us nothing will change us no no devil anywhere anytime anyhow will be able to take this message out of our lives but what must I stop doing is not what we need to be asking each one of us is confronted with this question about eternal life what must I do to inherit the kingdom of God what must I do to see this eternal life successful for me you know many times it's the ABCs it's not the Deep Mysteries we're not talking about the Deep Mysteries I wish that I was more consistent when it came to finances I'll just be honest but you know what I am consistent with is the word that's the one thing in my life that I'm consistent with and I know that if I'm consistent with the word then I'll get the right outcome because the word is the only thing that's going to change my body finances won't change my body even though we have to pay our bills we've got to be diligent with money but you know what if we could be as diligent with the word as we are with money in our lives brothers and sisters we might see a little bit of a difference David he had a leadership and just talking about leadership we can have leadership in our lives brothers and sisters and and maybe not just have the right leadership at the right time we can take leadership and apply it the wrong way in our lives and get the wrong outcome David had leadership in his life and you know they had the ark was sent back from the Philistines the the Philistines had the Ark of the Covenant for a while and it was in their Temple they thought we've got their God we've got him and and the Ark of the Covenant was underneath their gods and and the god Dagon just couldn't stand before the Ark of the Covenant when they had the Ark of the Covenant there they would stand them up and suddenly they would come back the next day and he'd be on his face before the ark that's no accident God was throwing down the enemy's Idols throwing down that that false god but what happened was that what did they do they sent the cart they sent the ark back to the to the to Israel to children of Israel but they put it on a new card is what the word says and it's interesting because David he knew that Ark was in the land and he said that art can't stay there that Ark needs to come up to my house that Ark needs to come to Jerusalem and it needs to be in the temple and when that Ark is there we know that God is going to be with us and we know that he got so excited and made all the preparations and what did he do he did everything brother Bradham says he had all the religious motion he did everything under the leadership the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in his life he did everything that he could to get that Ark back in its rightful position but the one thing that he didn't do was actually follow the levitical law and he built a new cart and it's interesting because it's exactly the same way that the enemy sent the cart back he picked up the cart and picked up the ark and brought it back and what happened a man lost his life an innocent man lost his life he had the right desire but he did it the wrong way and if we don't do it the right way ourselves brothers and sisters we could die this is life or death we're talking about and you know it's life or death for our children that we're talking about if we don't do it the right way we need to make sure that we're following the leadership of the Lord according to the word for our day we don't want to take the Ark of the Covenant and try and operate it the way that that David did or that the Philistines did and put it on a new cart the Ark of the Covenant the word for our day brothers and sisters is only designed to be carried over the heart only to be carried over the heart and some people might say well it's only designed to be carried over the heart of a levite but I would say it's got to come further than the levite the levite is the one that gives it out but then where do we carry that Ark of the Covenant in our lives brothers and sisters it's got to be on our own hearts but we can't do it according to the way that we think it should be done we have to do it I'm telling you we have to do it according to the word for our day if we don't do it according to the word for our day then we're not going to get the blessing we're looking for he says notice David thought everything was fine and he counseled all these people and they everyone begin to dance and shout and scream they had all their religious motions that there was but still it wasn't God's will to go down and bring the word of God back to the house of God isn't that wonderful to think though that when it did fall they took it into that man's house that man took it in and the word says that he was blessed from the moment that it reached his door even until after it left he was thoroughly blessed and you know brothers and sisters if we get that Ark of the Covenant in our lives it you can't help but be blessed by it he goes on to say but you see God always in all ages Works through one way his first decision is his only decision because it's perfect in his decision he never does anything except he first reveals it to his servants the prophets that's exactly and that's it's just so beautiful when we can recognize Amos 3 7 if we're wondering if God truly sent a prophet I I know we're preaching to the choir here but sometimes there's people listening that maybe don't understand this maybe there's sometimes people that will listen to this later that haven't quite heard that God sent a prophet and if God did send a prophet but I would say this if God were to send a prophet wouldn't you want to hear what he had to say and if you heard what that Prophet said and you believed that it was a prophet wouldn't you want to live what he said wouldn't you want to take it all and apply it or would you just reject it and say no I can't I just I just you know I got this great life and I just can't you know and turn away you know what will happen at that point is we'll lift up our eyes sometime in hell and we'll say my my my my my I had that opportunity but I just chose to to take what I had in that moment and accept that to be my absolute brothers and sisters we got to be willing to leave our fathers our mothers our our Kindred we got to be willing to leave our jobs we've got to be willing to leave our homes everything that we think that we know we've got to be willing to walk away from to be able to get this holy ghost in our lives and I'm not saying that you need to do anything extreme don't go and sell everything and give it to the poor and and and and just just make a vow of poverty to serve the Lord God that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is God needs to know that you're absolutely sold out unto him when he knows your heart is there then that's all he needs to do and you know nobody will ever know different because you won't look any different and Satan will come around and tell you you know different you're the same person but God will know and you'll know and you know that's one of the things one of the ordinances that I would say which is so important to us and and that is talking about tithing when we get that Revelation in our hearts brothers and sisters about tithing I'm not pulling for money don't get me wrong what I'm pulling for is for people to realize the full blessing the full manifestation of the blessing of the word of God in your home to see that Ark of the Covenant in your home to see the Lord bless you when you need help in your life but you know what I've heard Brothers say it and I think it's wonderful I got there myself and that's why I can talk about it I feel I got to the place where I couldn't wait to tithe because I knew the blessing that was in store for me and and I've talked about the tremendous testimony that I got for it the Lord just revealed to me how important it is to tithe but you know it's not about money at all maybe there's a little portion about it but if you're looking at it for money you're looking at it for the wrong reason you're missing the blessing the blessing is to recognize that you've got that Ark of the Covenant in your house and when you get sickness that comes knocking at your door when your children get sick when your children get upset when you have problems in your life then you can recognize hey I have come and I've applied the token according to the word the full entire blessing you know it's not just about tithing it's about communion it's about recognizing that's an ordinance that God has given us it's not something that we just say I can just take it or leave it I believe it therefore I participate in it brother Branham he goes on to say here but you see God always always in all ages Works through one way his first decision is his only decision because he's perfect in his decision he never does nothing except he first reveals it to his servants the prophets that's exactly that's why this the church age that we live in there's no church no Methodist no Baptist no Pentecostal and brother Berry will say no message believer or anything else can ever put this church into the bride it'll have to be the answering of Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to be revealed to because that's the only way our churches denominate and throw the thing into a mess and huddle they just like they've always been and God always sends the prophet we're not interested in getting people to church here we want to get people to Christ getting people to church will make us look good and it might make us feel good but it won't get you to Christ you won't have that Ark of the Covenant in your home when you need it brothers and sisters if we can get that Ark of the Covenant in our homes that Pillar of Fire that rests upon that Mercy Seat my goodness but it's what messes people up sometimes we we feel like coming to communion and and having communion just doing that will actually get us the blessing and it's not we need to understand why we need to recognize the purpose of it just like coming to church on a Sunday why do we come to church on a Sunday we need to recognize the purpose of it we come to church on a Sunday to get Washed by the Water of the word it's through the fivefold ministry is the perfecting of the Saints that's what the scripture says that's why we come to church we don't come to church just to feel good in our lives even though you can't help but feel good when you actually get Washed by the Water of the word brothers and sisters like we talked about the stimulation of Revelation that comes from a communion service something happens to you supernaturally when you come and you meet with Melchizedek but uh we're looking for the word of God in our lives we're looking to see the Lord manifest in our lives we're not interested in just joining a church and being a part of a group and we certainly don't want to do it our own way if we try and do it our own way then we'll wind up like David we'll wind up like David and we'll have all the religious motion we'll go to Every service maybe even go to communion service but not just not have one thing right can can put it in a position where someone can lose their life you know brother Branham talks about it how our lives are such a witness that people actually can actually receive eternal life from seeing Our Lives lived people can actually choose to reject the word from seeing Our Lives lived also we need to be careful because like that song says brothers and sisters we are the word made flesh today because this is what the scriptures say you know we can have all the religious motion and all the best organizations and all of it might not be the way that God chose he wants to see that Ark of the Covenant in in the proper location and that's in our heart that's the mercy seat for today it's in a temple that's not built with hands but it's up to the people to accept it one way or the other God's permissive will or his perfect will and you know it's beautiful because like we talked about a little bit earlier when the Ark of the Covenant was coming up and it fell and that man put his hand forward and died he lost his life it wasn't because he didn't have the right intention he fully had the right intention the Ark of the Covenant was going to fall who would want to see that happen but it was still against the law of God but you know this this this brother the household of Obed Edom he was a goodite he had the word for three months in his house and the Lord blessed him and that was an opportunity for the Lord to show how he can take his permissive will and make it as perfect will because this brother wasn't expecting that blessing at all was he is probably going to go out and wave there goes the Ark of the Covenant past my house there goes the god of Israel The Mercy Seat itself in a parade going past my house with all the religious motion but what happened was that Ark of the Covenant came to his house brothers and sisters and you know if we are in our position the Ark of the Covenant wants to come to our houses too we can see that happen in our lives and you know looking at this story about the Rich Young Ruler in leadership we've got to be willing to accept it the way that God gives it to us in our day we can say you know I I think that it should have happened a different way and I would have liked it to be otherwise but you know the way that God gives it to us is the way that we need it otherwise he would have given it to us differently it would be in a different fashion this Rich Young Ruler out of leadership we know that it's accounted for in Matthew Mark and Luke where today we're reading out of out of Mark and brother Branham says that's the same thing that this boy was confronted with you come in been a member of the Pharisees or Sadducees or some great order of that day he was religious as can be he said I've observed all these Commandments I've been taught since I was a youth see Jesus loved him for it but he refused to be guided he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ give to give him eternal life he believed there was something different than what he had or he would never have said good Master what must I do now see he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do the way we want to do ourselves the gift of God is a free gift God give it to you you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see I just think it's a beautiful thing to to recognize and I know I've read that quote already today but I just I'm reading it again because I think it's important for us to recognize there's no other way for us to do it other than the way that God has ordained for us in our day and when we want to try and mix something else with it brothers and sisters we're getting a hybrid religion it's not going to turn out the way that we want it to and and you know this story here this is where it's so beautiful and and where it becomes I believe alive to me alive to us in our lives I don't have great wealth and and a great fortune or even a little Fortune where I can say you know if God told me to just forget it all then I could comprehend maybe what that would mean but what what I want to get to today brothers and sisters is that he'll come around and he'll show us if we ask him earnestly what is there in my life Lord what what is there if I was that rich young ruler and I met you on the road today which you can meet for him today brothers and sisters even right now in this service if there's something in your life if you ask him he will reveal it to you but then you're faced with that moment of decision in your life this is what we want to get to this is the nuts and bolts of it all when he gives us that answer are we willing to accept it or do we say oh my I don't know if I can do that we know that the Rich Young Ruler lifted up his eyes and hell he wound up in a situation that was beyond his control he could not go back and fix it he had that one opportunity and when God gives us the opportunity in our lives to meet that Pillar of Fire are we willing to accept it or are we willing to say no I don't know I think everything that I've been taught is good and and everything that I've got right now is fine and it's just going to remain the same way you know it might do that in this life but what's going to happen do we actually get access to that eternal life and it just goes right back full circle to the Token right back full circle to getting the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters when we do get that opportunity to say Lord what is it in my life that I need help with Lord help me find this problem help me solve this problem in my life when we do that and he gives us the answer for it when we have the Holy Ghost we'll say thank you Lord thank you Lord and we'll actually make a change in our life we will change what we're doing we'll change our Direction we'll change our trajectory and we'll make a difference but if he gives us the answer and we don't change how can that help us brothers and sisters I think it will come to the place in our lives where we're going to start getting right down to the nitty-gritty where ananias and Sapphira times will be upon us and we will not be able to hide who we are and what we believe in we will stand out we will show who we are and the only way that we're going to show that we're a part of his kingdom that we have met that Pillar of Fire and that we have accepted his leadership in our lives and that we are able to go on to True communion is to show the true holy ghost in our lives saying Amen to every word not every word that brother Berry says every word the prophet of God said every word that the Holy Ghost says through the word that he gives us out of leadership he says notice he knew it was there the Rich Young Ruler knew it was there he knew there was something there he knew it was there he believed in it and he wanted it but when he was confronted with how he had to do it it was different from his ritual it was different how many times in our lives can we just get a little bit outside of our ritual oh my is it right is it wrong if it lines up with the scriptures brothers and sisters I'd say get outside of your ritual all day long go for it and see if God won't bless it if it lines up with the word if it does line up with the word just leave it alone it was different from his ritual brother Branham says it was different he could hold on to his money and belong onto one on onto the church that he belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew that and Jesus knew that he had hoarded this money he loved his money he hoarded it and he said go sell all you've got and give it to the poor and come take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven but that Rich Young Ruler he just couldn't do that he loved his money but you know brothers and sisters we just said it a minute ago I'm going to say it again it can be anything in our lives that one thing that we know about that God he speaks to us about it and we have the opportunity to accept it or to reject it and and isn't it wonderful does anybody hear his voice does anybody have this problem this thing in their lives where God speaks to us and gives us this leadership I I just trust that I'm I'm I'm I'm talking to people of like Precious Faith here because I feel it in my life but when he does that we're given the opportunity and and I just think it's amazing because in my life if if I were to be living under the law and and to just the moment that I reject it in my life I should be dead according to the law I I should have just been thrashed long ago even as a Believer and maybe even as a pastor because I'm just human the only thing I can do is step into an office and allow the Lord pray that the Lord operates it and you know that it's the people that actually operate the gift it's not the pastor that does it but you know it's interesting because I just can't help but think about his long-suffering and his kindness towards me his long suffering and his forgiveness because he'll say you've got this thing and and he'll say it today and tomorrow I'll get up in the morning and he'll say you've got this thing and the next day I'll get up and he'll say you've got this thing and the next day he'll say you got this thing in the next month and the next year you got this thing his long-suffering his kindness and gentleness towards me I I have reason to shout reason to Rejoice because he does care enough to lead me and guide me and tell me you've got this thing buried you you need to deal with it and and when I don't deal with it he comes around and tells me you need to deal with it my goodness it's so tremendous to think about his goodness to me brother Branham says he could hold his money and belong to the church that he belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew that and knew that he had hoarded his money and he said go sell you God give to the poor come take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven but he couldn't do it and you know as much as we struggle and strive in our lives and and we we feel like we just can't make a difference in our lives Brothers and Sisters Day by Day word sell upon word cell we are making a difference and you know we're not making a difference he's making a difference because we're not who we used to be and sometimes we just need to zoom out and reflect like brother Cadre said I know that I'm not who I want to be but I'm sure not who I used to be oh Lord have mercy and just keep talking to me and so long as we're willing to keep Fellowship in with him he'll keep fellowshipping with us oh this Rich Young Ruler he was told just get rid of it all throw down everything you think you know get rid of it I'll give it all to the poor whatever it is in your life that's holding you back you know what it is just lay it down and follow me take all that you think you know and throw it all to the wind and just follow me and see if I won't bless you and we all know what that is in our lives and if we're willing to do that brothers and sisters sometimes it's not the whole shooting match sometimes it's not the whole whole whole I don't know call it a ball of wax it's not everything all at once it's little by little but brothers and sisters so long as you're willing to make a step an effort and show him that little by little I'm actually making a difference I'm trying in my life to change things so that I can actually follow you he knows it he knows our hearts but he knows if we're just willing to reject it and say oh no I'm not interested in that I can't do that I'm not I'm not trying to say what it is in your life what I'm saying is his leadership shows you in your life and we're all faced with that problem because whatever that problem is it's holding us back from eternal life it's holding us back from going into that position and until we get to that position where we're all positionally placed in Christ Jesus right now here on Earth on this side of Eternity than the Rapture ain't gonna go but boy once we recognize who we are when we recognize what we are brothers and sisters this world isn't going to have any more hold on us isn't it amazing to think about how this world is right on the brink teetering right on the very brink of Eternity we know that when the bride goes up there's three and a half years left right three and a half years left on this Earth of tribulation and then we go to the white Throne then we go into tremendous tremendous change of everything the skies roll back like a scroll like we've heard about so many times we've sang those songs we're on the brink of Eternity right now today we know the the discussion about whether a bomb goes off and the bride will go home I just want to say this and and maybe we could have a discussion about it I think it's important though we were talking a little bit about this on the way up yesterday but you know sort of in our morning devotions we're talking about it how the word says in in the in the Visions in 1933 that a bomb is going to go off in the United States of America and and it'll be a smoldering ruin and we all sort of understand that and we look towards that and we know brother Branham said it's a nuclear bomb it's going to be a nuclear bomb and it you know what the USA's name is on that nuclear bomb and and it can be real easy to look at that and say that's the promise that that we're looking for because before one of those goes off we're going home but sometimes people can actually say a quote in such a way that it doesn't say exactly that and what I'm getting at is we can say before one bomb goes off the bride goes home so what happens if a strategic nuke goes off in the Ukraine and the bride doesn't go home does that mean we've missed the rapture I think it's important to talk about because we could see that happen today in our lives we could see it happen and are we ready to go home we need to make sure that we're ready to go home but if it goes off somewhere else brothers and sisters that doesn't mean we've missed the Rapture is my point we need to make sure that we're looking for the right thing and the right thing not that we're looking for it don't get me wrong we're not looking to see the United States of America destroyed we're looking to go to Glory but we know before the United States of America gets destroyed the bride goes home if it's if if a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere else that doesn't mean that we've missed it totally sidetracked there we need to know that we've got it fixed up that we've got it right we need to know that our hearts are correct and like I said brothers and sisters sometimes we have things in our lives we can get ourselves into positions where we can't make a change I'll tell you honestly just so you can hear a real life example we got into a position where we had a business in our lives that was running us people should have a business that they run right that's the way it should work but we got to a place where a business was absolutely running us my wife and myself were so completely busy we had no time for each other we had no time for our children and we barely had time for church That's The Way We Were but by the grace of God he has intervened and helped us in our lives and it's been Supernatural the way it's happened but brothers and sisters we couldn't just say you know this business that we've got we're just gonna throw it away and God's going to bless us I'm not saying that that's what we need to do in our lives he'll show us things in our lives that we need to change but so long as we've got the right mental attitude towards any promise of God he'll bring it to pass in our lives he will actually help us along the way and that's what this leadership is we're talking about many times we get into such a complicated problem such a complex position that we can't just turn and go the other way maybe maybe those people who don't have a business would say well sure you can you could totally do that if we did that in our business then we would leave customers with houses torn apart and Renovations not finished we would have um people that were actually working for us not getting paid many times companies would just go bankrupt and you could do that but would we do that as believers we had to try and find a way to do it with Integrity to make sure that our customers were looked after to make sure here I am talking about all this business stuff forgive me but what my point is that sometimes we can have ourselves in into painted into such a corner that we can't just take one step and get out of it it's a 50-step procedure to get out of it but God will take us and he will lead us if we're willing to follow him but this Rich Young Ruler he couldn't do it he couldn't follow him he says it wasn't according to his ritual what was his ritual isn't that weird it wasn't according to his ritual he just talked about his his hoarding of the money and maybe that's what the ritual was the hoarding of the money he just couldn't stop hoarding money he just couldn't stop dealing with his business maybe that's what it was he says the other leaders that he had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way that's where I think it's powerful to hear what this brother Victor said in Edmonton about his culture brothers and sisters it doesn't matter there ain't no culture in the Holy Ghost we've got to be willing to say I don't care what anybody has taught me in the past what I know right now today does it line up with the word because if it doesn't it might not be according to the word for our day the other leaders that he had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life the only one that can give you not the church can't give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your Creed only Jesus Christ himself can give you eternal life see no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm going to say this I'm going to insert this here that person of Jesus Christ is the message of the hour the message of the hour that William Miriam Branham brought was an invitation to the wedding supper in the sky it was an invitation to come to the marriage of the Lamb it was an invitation to take the word of God and actually change your name to his name that's the message of the hour that's what he's talking about here people might say oh you're interpreting what the prophet said he's saying it very clearly right here no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and what's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ the revealed word for our day brothers and sisters the opening of this word is the Lord Jesus Christ the word coming of God before we meet with him in the clouds but if we reject the word coming of God and say oh it's got to be some other way it's not according to my ritual then we're going to miss it we're going to find ourselves standing before the white Throne of judgment one day hoping that there's something that will maybe Merit me an opportunity to see this eternal life when right now today at my voice the sound of my voice because we've all had different times but here we are in this present moment brothers and sisters this present moment God's choosing to speak to us right now this way if we want to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ right now we have the opportunity to accept the person of Jesus Christ or reject them and one day in eternity we're going to look at it and say wow I I'm so glad that I did that I'm so glad that I heard the word of God in my day and you know it's nothing that we could ever do we can't just decide one day I want to hear the word of God for my dad I want to be able to hear the message of the hour how many of us ever set out to hear the message of the hour God just gave it to us he just delivered it to us through our parents sometimes he he sent someone our way with the word just like this Obed Edom he had the Ark of the Covenant go past his house that one day and what happened is it stopped to fellowship with him and changed his life forever no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and manifests itself to this age that life you're living it's not something that we just say brothers and sisters I think this is the most beautiful part he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifests itself to this age in that you're living in this man though this Rich Young Ruler he wanted to do something himself he wanted to do his own way we don't want to do it our own way we want to follow the word of God and and I want to say this brothers and sisters if we have lived our lives up until now a certain way just try and follow the word of God just say I don't know if if I have done it right in the past and I I I I don't know if it's right or wrong but it doesn't matter because what's in the past is in the past the only thing I can do is what's right now in the moment and going forwards he says see I wanted to do he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do we we want to do something ourselves the gift of God is a free gift God give it to you and you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it see I think that's such a beautiful quote you're going to have it I know I read it earlier but I just think it's worth bearing records saying it again you're going to have it brothers and sisters Satan wants us to believe there's something that we can do to not have it the only thing that we can do to not have it is just not receive it but I believe we're all here as receivers of this word and you know when we receive the word we become doers of the word we're not just hearers of the word we're receiving the word when we're receiving it we're taking it into ourselves it's becoming a part of us we're confronted with it we have the opportunity to do something with it it's only Christ that can give it to us brothers and sisters says the other leaders that he had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way God's provided way today is the message of the hour it truly is the message that was given to us by the prophet of Malachi 4. though the word that was fulfilled was fulfilled in Revelations 10 7. is is this message of the hour it is the pillar of fire it is God's provided way and I would say I know brother Branham says it too we would all probably agree with it that it's God's only provided way it's God's only provided place of worship it's only those who accept this word that will truly go in the rapture it's not going to be a cataclysmic event we know that it was one out of a million that went across we know that it was eight Souls that were saved on the boat but it was only one that went before judgment it was only one that lived a life of Enoch that that walked with God and just was not and and that truly is the called out of the called out that's the church called out of the church that brother Branham talks about and he talks about it I believe in in leadership here it's just such a a profound thing to think that he is calling us out of a church it manifests itself this word manifests itself and and when we live our lives according to this word we can't help but push out this word when the word is what we take in and that's what I was talking about these brothers that are going to start ministering they're they're actually going to be pushing out what they've been taking in and when you Minister you have to be able to do that to just say you can't do it is you know they're gonna they're gonna do it one way or another we're all going to do it we're all going to Manifest this word when we take it in when you drink it when you drink in you push out brother Bradham talks about the trees the trees they have seasons that's why there's rings in the stump of a tree when you look at it there's a season and each ring represents a season of growth and we all go through seasons of growth sometimes we go through droughts brothers and sisters it doesn't mean that we're not growing sometimes we just have a little bit of a hard time other times we have a big part of growth and and the ring is really big in our lives and and that's the way it goes sometimes the season is long sometimes the season is short that's the life that we live in it's not a perfect life we know that there's only one thing that's perfect in this life and that's God that's Christ himself Melchizedek but it manifests itself out of leadership brother Adam says no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and then when you do that he is the word and your life fits right into the word it manifests itself to this age that you're living in you know going back to what we talked about with brother Mervin the outer body has the five senses the spirit has the inner five senses but both of those are there to protect the soul that's the reason we have them it's the only reason we have them maybe I'm getting a bit crazy to say that but I just believe it it's the only reason we have them is to protect that soul to keep that Soul safe but you know that soul is is there for a purpose and it was created well I can't believe we're already out of time I can't uh just looking at this that soul is created for one purpose we know that that brother Bradham said that God created that little teeny space in the heart of only a human being it's not in any other animal he created that space for himself and that's for that soul and that's on the inside of the inside and we have the ability to accept that word not just on our body not just to quit smoking drinking lying gambling and doing all the things that we used to do not just thinking that we're good because we don't think those thoughts anymore and we don't actually do those other things anymore and a lot of the memories we've erased out of our minds and everything on our inner senses is good it's got to go further than that brothers and sisters we got to go justification sanctification on through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ himself living out through Us in the control tower of our lives and the only place that control tower is is in that teeny little spot I just can't help but think about it you know when we were at the youth meeting it was it was pretty neat we know the the story we're probably all familiar with it but we talked about it you know how the life that's in the fire it's got to be in our lives and the only way that we can actually have that in our lives is to be a part of it and and during the the Youth Event we had a fire going and I was able to do it I was able to take a call excuse me out of the fire and set it on the Hearth outside of the fire and it was the same thing that was inside the fire when we took it out it was red hot and we set it there on the Hearth and just in a few minutes not very long it was no longer red hot it went to a dull color and it went darker and darker and darker and very soon it was just black just like an ash sitting there on the hearth and and you know what that's what happens to our lives if we get away from that fire we can't get outside of that fire in our lives and expect to remain hot it's just not going to work but we took that same call and we put it right back into the fire and it turned just as orange as it was and I couldn't help but think this morning you know once in a while brothers and sisters maybe this is the job of a pastor sometimes our fire can be burning but it's just sort of smoldering it's you know got a little bit of flame it's got lots of heat there there's tons of heat in the bottom of it but it's just sort of there and just sort of smoldering and sometimes all we need to do is just take a stick and just bump it just bump it I can't help but think sometimes maybe as a pastor we just need to just bump the body and shake off those coals on the outside and cause all the wood to draw that much closer together and what happens when you do that the Flames just instantly rise up and you know brothers and sisters there's other example that I got it's just so beautiful but sometimes all of the potential is right there in the fire but you just need to put one more log on and you know when that one log goes on and starts to burn when that one log starts to burn bright what it does is it pulls fire out of all the rest of the logs that are there everything just turns into one big fire I just can't help but think sometimes in the Church of the Living God maybe we just need a little bit of a shake maybe we just need one log brothers and sisters I want to say it today you could be that one luck don't resist the Holy Ghost when he comes around and says I want you to lift your hands and worship I want you to stand up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and receive the healing for your cancer because you know what if you do that if you're willing to follow it you can see someone else get saved you could see somebody else get healed because another log went on the fire and it just drew the Heat and the Flames out of the fire that's already there my goodness sometimes we just need a little bit of stirring sometimes we just need to recognize we've already got the fire we've already got the leadership of the Holy Ghost we just need to get hot my goodness I better call them musicians we got a service tonight uh I feel like I'm just getting started man this is good thus saith the Lord let my people go isn't that the the scripture that was a Sunday school memory verse thus saith the Lord let my people go and you know we have that opportunity in our lives today to recognize it as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church he said you see the same thing in type taking them to the Glorious Eternal promised land this isn't just brother Barry speaking all this this is the prophet of God saying it he says now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if your Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are you've got you got to this age nothing against them not at all but this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of Christ which is the word maybe stand with me this morning we have got to be willing to accept the person of Christ which is the word today brothers and sisters the word for another day won't do it for us it's got to be the word for today a for 2022 before the eternity began back in eternity before when he was on the cross he had us on his mind he saw us here this morning and he knew the thoughts that would be in our very heart while we're here let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we thank you for your stirring Lord we thank you for your leadership father Lord Jesus we pray that Lord as we go forwards you would continue leading us on to a full communion father Lord that it wouldn't just be a service that we attend father even though we know it's an ordinance that you've given us but father that we would truly come to know you in the power of your Resurrection for ourselves Lord that we would have that communion every day of Our Lives Lord Jesus and father that when we have a communion service it would be something that we just can't wait to get to because we know it's an opportunity to be a part of you to accept you to receive you the way that you have given unto us father in our day Lord we just love you we thank you we pray that we could all be led Lord Jesus help one of none of us father to have a a strong heart and a stiff neck father and to say that I've heard it all and I just don't need any of it oh Father we all need you father and I pray that we could all just follow you according to the leadership of our day your word father we just love you we thank you we ask that you would just be glorified now in a couple of songs and if it Be Your Will for us to gather together tonight for the communion service father that you
