[52:51] musicians God bless you if you could
[52:53] please turn in your Bibles with me to
[52:55] Genesis chapter
[52:57] 2 I have three portions of scripture to
[53:00] read we'll start with the first one and
[53:03] I will have you take your seats while I
[53:06] read the other
[53:08] two um portions of scripture Genesis
[53:12] chapter 2 from Verse 18 Genesis 2 Verse
[53:17] 18 we all know Genesis the 1 book of the
[53:21] Bible very easy to find
[53:26] if you hear there say
[53:27] Amen all right I'll
[53:31] read and the Lord God said it is not
[53:34] good that the man should be alone I will
[53:38] make him an help made for him and out of
[53:42] the
[53:43] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[53:46] of the field and every fowl of the earth
[53:49] and brought them unto Adam to see what
[53:53] he will call them and whatsoever Adam
[53:55] called every living creature that was
[53:58] the name thereof and Adam gave names to
[54:01] all cattle and to the foul of the earth
[54:05] and to every beast of the field but for
[54:08] Adam there was not found an help meat
[54:12] for
[54:13] him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[54:17] to fall upon Adam and he slept and he
[54:19] took one of his reaps and clothes of the
[54:22] flesh instead thereof and the reap which
[54:25] the Lord God had taken from the man made
[54:27] he a woman and brought her unto the man
[54:32] and Adam said this is now the bone of my
[54:35] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[54:40] called woman because she was taken out
[54:44] of
[54:46] man he then says therefore shall a man
[54:51] leave his father and his mother and
[54:54] shall cleave unto his wife life and they
[54:57] shall be one flesh you may have your
[55:01] seat I'll flip over to Mark chapter
[55:04] 10 I'll read from verse 1 to9 a lot of
[55:08] reading this morning we trust in the
[55:11] Lord will be our
[55:13] help just want to make sure that we set
[55:15] the context from the
[55:17] scriptures because we have nothing else
[55:19] to bring other than what has been given
[55:21] to
[55:22] us and he arose from then and cometh
[55:25] into the coast of Judea by the father
[55:28] side of Jordan and the people Resort
[55:32] unto him again and as he was once he
[55:36] taught them again and the Pharisees came
[55:39] to him and asked him is it lawful for a
[55:43] man to put away his wife tempting
[55:48] him and he answered and said unto them
[55:51] what did Moses command you and they said
[55:55] Moses suffered to write a bill of
[55:57] divorcement to put her away and Jesus
[56:01] answered and said unto them for the
[56:05] hardness of your heart he wrote you this
[56:09] precept but from the beginning of the
[56:13] creation God made them male and female
[56:18] now this where I'm taking my title from
[56:20] this morning for this cause so my title
[56:23] is for this cause for this cause shall a
[56:26] man leave his father and mother and
[56:29] cleave unto his wife and their twain
[56:33] shall be one flesh so then they are no
[56:35] more Twain but one flesh what therefore
[56:39] God had joined together let not man put
[56:44] aund last scripture reading Ephesians
[56:48] chapter
[56:53] 5 Ephesians 5
[56:56] all very common scriptures you probably
[56:58] can guess where I'm going this
[57:05] morning from verse
[57:08] 22 it says wives submit yourselves unto
[57:12] your own husbands as unto the Lord for
[57:14] the husband is the head of the wife even
[57:18] as Christ is the head of the church and
[57:21] he is the savior of the body therefore
[57:24] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[57:28] let the wives be to their own husbands
[57:30] in everything husbands love your wives
[57:34] even as Christ also loved the church and
[57:37] gave himself for it that he might
[57:40] sanctify and cleanse it with a washing
[57:42] of Water by the word that he might
[57:44] present it to himself a glorious church
[57:47] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[57:50] thing that it should be holy and without
[57:54] blemish
[57:57] so ought men to love their wives as
[57:59] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[58:02] loveth
[58:03] himself for no man yet ever yet hateth
[58:06] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[58:08] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[58:11] church for we are members of his body
[58:14] and of his flesh and of his bones for
[58:16] this cause again we are seeing that
[58:18] phrase again you notice the first time
[58:22] we saw um something close to that phrase
[58:25] was in genes is to use the word
[58:27] therefore but they are all very similar
[58:29] meanings right and when Jesus was also
[58:32] going to answer the question he also
[58:34] took them back to where the beginning
[58:37] right and now we see Paul
[58:40] comparing what we see on
[58:43] Earth with what we see in
[58:47] heaven I won't go ahead of myself
[58:50] sometimes I like to go ahead of myself
[58:52] you know why sometimes people fall
[58:55] asleep so I can give it before they fall
[58:58] asleep but hopefully no one will fall
[58:59] asleep this morning I know we had less
[59:01] an hour of sleep um but we are trusting
[59:04] the Lord for strength right for this
[59:08] cause shall a man leave his father and
[59:10] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[59:13] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[59:17] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[59:20] Christ and the church nevertheless let
[59:22] every one of you in particular still
[59:24] love his wife even as himself and the
[59:27] wife see that she Reverend her
[59:30] husband so I said this morning the Lord
[59:33] had blessings to the Ring of his word my
[59:35] title is for this
[59:37] cause and if you look at that phrase for
[59:40] this cause if we look at the strong
[59:43] lexicon it says it's the same as for the
[59:46] sake of because of or on account
[59:53] of
[59:55] and when you look at this it's telling
[59:58] us
[59:59] that when those words are used it's
[1:00:02] pointing us to the reason for which
[1:00:04] something has been
[1:00:06] said many times when we talk about
[1:00:11] marriage which was instituted by God
[1:00:14] which was authored by God we don't often
[1:00:17] consider the reason why God set marriage
[1:00:21] in
[1:00:22] place we don't consider the why
[1:00:26] but AB brah preached many messages that
[1:00:28] started with why there were few he
[1:00:31] preached that was just you know the word
[1:00:33] why he had some messages that he
[1:00:36] preached that started with why including
[1:00:39] why I am a holy ruler why I pray for the
[1:00:42] sick why are people so tossed about why
[1:00:47] is it that so many Christians find it
[1:00:50] hard find it so hard I like the word so
[1:00:53] hard because it didn't just say find it
[1:00:54] hard but they find it so hard to live
[1:00:56] the Christian Life why some people can't
[1:00:59] keep the victory why are we not a
[1:01:03] denomination why little Bethlehem why
[1:01:06] cist speak why I am against organized
[1:01:09] religion why he had to be Shepherds in
[1:01:11] all of this messages brother Braham was
[1:01:13] trying to answer a question of why
[1:01:16] something had to be the way it
[1:01:18] was now if you look at the word those
[1:01:21] the phrase that we used uh for this
[1:01:23] cause by title this morning it could
[1:01:26] also be said to have been derived from a
[1:01:29] primary proposition of purpose or result
[1:01:34] and I want to spend some time this
[1:01:35] morning to dwell on that word
[1:01:38] purpose because purpose is very very
[1:01:41] important purpose tells us the reason
[1:01:44] for something if you don't know the
[1:01:46] purpose of something you cannot
[1:01:48] effectively
[1:01:49] function in that place in that in that
[1:01:52] state or or whatever that thing is if
[1:01:56] you don't know the purpose why you come
[1:01:57] to church you can't get the full benefit
[1:01:59] of coming to church if you buy a garget
[1:02:02] and you don't know the purpose of it you
[1:02:03] cannot get the full benefit of that
[1:02:05] garget so it's important to know
[1:02:09] purpose now when we start to talk about
[1:02:11] purpose the corresponding Greek word
[1:02:14] that was used you know in the Bible um
[1:02:18] you know we we we have a scripture that
[1:02:20] we often quote for I know the thoughts
[1:02:21] that I think towards you said the Lord
[1:02:24] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:02:26] give you an expected end that word
[1:02:29] that's been translated as thought in
[1:02:31] English actually is the same translation
[1:02:35] as the word
[1:02:36] purpose right are we are you with me
[1:02:38] this morning are you with me this
[1:02:40] morning let's say amen
[1:02:44] yeah so purpose is very
[1:02:47] important and it refers to a deliberate
[1:02:50] plan or purpose the word that was used
[1:02:53] which is
[1:02:54] prothesis and this conveys the idea of
[1:02:57] something that is set forth or displayed
[1:03:00] often in the context of God's Divine
[1:03:02] Purpose or plan so when God says for I
[1:03:05] know the thought I have towards you it
[1:03:08] could also be said for I know the
[1:03:09] purpose that I have towards you now in
[1:03:13] our regular World organizations spend so
[1:03:16] much money on purpose more than we
[1:03:19] know I work in what is called one of the
[1:03:23] four big firms consulting firms in the
[1:03:26] world the biggest of the of of them the
[1:03:29] four biggest ones and it would interest
[1:03:32] you to know how much money we spend for
[1:03:35] our firm and for other companies to help
[1:03:37] them to discover their
[1:03:39] purpose you will find words um books
[1:03:42] that you know have titles like
[1:03:44] purpose-driven life now in studies that
[1:03:47] they have done they realize that
[1:03:49] organizations that are Purpose Driven
[1:03:53] they have at least 10% more in Revenue
[1:03:57] and many times a three or four times
[1:04:00] more better in Employee Engagement and
[1:04:03] productivity they have better customer
[1:04:06] loyalty and reputation they are better
[1:04:08] at Innovation and long-term strategy and
[1:04:12] they are more resilient during crisis
[1:04:15] why because they understand purpose they
[1:04:18] understand the why they understand the
[1:04:22] reason now brother Braham told us that
[1:04:24] our existence is for a purpose in
[1:04:26] Victory Day He said and each one of us
[1:04:29] is burned for
[1:04:31] something we just wasn't put here for
[1:04:34] nothing he said that mountain never
[1:04:36] happened out there just to be that tree
[1:04:40] was not put there for a was put there
[1:04:43] for a purpose everything is for a
[1:04:45] purpose it's God to serve and we are
[1:04:49] here for a
[1:04:50] purpose and brother Ram talked about
[1:04:53] Dwight Moody who a w woman a wash woman
[1:04:58] um got inspired to rent a place and have
[1:05:00] an evangelist come preach and it was in
[1:05:03] this service that Dwight Moody was saved
[1:05:07] and brother Bram said that that
[1:05:11] woman that did that she would be
[1:05:13] rewarded for all the souls the millions
[1:05:16] of souls that Dwight Moody want to the
[1:05:19] Lord because she recognized her
[1:05:22] purpose she recognized that she was not
[1:05:25] just a wash woman she got inspired to do
[1:05:28] something and she went ahead and did it
[1:05:31] because God said are there for a purpose
[1:05:35] amen now God himself he had a purpose
[1:05:39] amen but something about purpose his
[1:05:42] purpose starts out as a
[1:05:43] mystery that's why we always say
[1:05:46] discover your purpose amen it's not on
[1:05:48] the surface it's not easy to find you've
[1:05:51] got to dig deep to find it brother Bram
[1:05:55] said said in Christ is the mystery of
[1:05:57] God revealed he said now God had a
[1:05:59] purpose a hidden
[1:06:01] Mystery and that's what I want to speak
[1:06:04] unto the church this morning the hidden
[1:06:06] Mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:06:08] before the world ever begun and how that
[1:06:10] it's unfolded itself right now to this
[1:06:13] present hour it was a mystery but not
[1:06:17] the prophet saying it has unfolded
[1:06:20] itself amen we are still going to come
[1:06:23] to marriage but I want to set the
[1:06:26] foundation right Hallelujah so that we
[1:06:29] understand the importance of knowing
[1:06:32] what the purpose is for this cause we
[1:06:36] didn't Institute marriage God instituted
[1:06:39] marriage but for what purpose amen is it
[1:06:42] to have children is it to have a
[1:06:44] companion is it to have someone that you
[1:06:46] know like the Bible said is better for
[1:06:49] two is better um two is better than one
[1:06:52] because when one is cold the other one
[1:06:54] keeps him warm
[1:06:56] right is is it we we could ask those
[1:06:59] questions but the answer is right in the
[1:07:02] pages of the
[1:07:04] scripture now brother BR was typing
[1:07:06] because you've got to understand that
[1:07:08] God's ways are always the
[1:07:11] same if God started out with a mystery a
[1:07:16] purpose brother Abraham called it a
[1:07:19] threefold
[1:07:20] purpose and God is revealing that
[1:07:23] purpose he's been revealing it from the
[1:07:25] start of time and still revealing it
[1:07:27] today then we understand that God works
[1:07:30] by the principle of
[1:07:33] purpose now many people you know we are
[1:07:36] we we are humans that study you know
[1:07:39] what God has done and based on that we
[1:07:41] able to create something that's similar
[1:07:43] think about the airplane the people that
[1:07:45] created the airplane started the
[1:07:48] bird how does the bird you know fly how
[1:07:51] does he Glide they took time to study it
[1:07:55] and they try to use the principle that
[1:07:58] is already existing in
[1:08:02] nature to create something that helps us
[1:08:05] to travel quicker and further right now
[1:08:10] brother Bram said God's great
[1:08:12] mystery of how it's a
[1:08:17] secret purpose STS out as a secret he
[1:08:21] kept it a secret nobody know nothing
[1:08:23] about it even the angel didn't
[1:08:26] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:08:28] that's the reason under a seventh
[1:08:30] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:08:33] there was
[1:08:35] silence there was silence because why it
[1:08:37] was a mystery God kept it a secret right
[1:08:42] but we know that that secret has been
[1:08:43] revealed amen so what was this purpose
[1:08:46] that God had brother brah said it was a
[1:08:48] three-fold purpose he said the first
[1:08:51] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[1:08:53] himself to the people God filled all
[1:08:56] Earth and
[1:08:58] space we couldn't get a hold of him we
[1:09:01] couldn't see him and the very first
[1:09:04] thing God will do was to condescend and
[1:09:07] if you think about the word condescend
[1:09:09] it means to come to a lower level the
[1:09:12] god that could not be contained in every
[1:09:14] anything first formed himself out as a
[1:09:18] logos a word
[1:09:20] body but that was not enough because
[1:09:23] though the logos appeared in many ways
[1:09:26] to some people in the Old Testament it
[1:09:29] was not permanent permanently with them
[1:09:32] that they could have interactions with
[1:09:33] him that they could learn from him the
[1:09:36] logos came in a body melis sedc appeared
[1:09:38] unto Abraham the logos took a body went
[1:09:41] and was the fourth man on the fire for
[1:09:44] the three Hebrew
[1:09:45] children but God had a purpose in mind
[1:09:48] he wanted to reveal himself to us he
[1:09:51] wanted us to be able to experience him
[1:09:54] not just as God that is super but as a
[1:09:57] human
[1:09:58] being and then the Fulfillment of that
[1:10:02] very first purpose of God to reveal
[1:10:05] himself to the people was the coming of
[1:10:07] Jesus Christ but brother BR told us it
[1:10:10] was a threefold purpose he said the
[1:10:13] second purpose which is more relevant to
[1:10:16] us is to have the preeminence in this
[1:10:19] body of Believers that is his bride that
[1:10:22] he might live in people amen now God has
[1:10:27] fulfill the first fold of that purpose
[1:10:29] Jesus Christ came on Earth he did what
[1:10:31] he was meant to do now the second fold
[1:10:34] of the purpose is he wants to live in me
[1:10:37] and
[1:10:39] you not just live in us but live out our
[1:10:44] lives by himself not us living our lives
[1:10:46] but he wanted to live out our life right
[1:10:51] he wanted a bride that he might leave in
[1:10:53] the people
[1:10:56] now the third purpose is fold of that
[1:11:00] purpose is is futuristic he said is to
[1:11:02] restore the kingdom to his rightly
[1:11:04] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:11:07] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[1:11:10] of the evening with a people and talked
[1:11:12] with them and fellowship with them we
[1:11:14] know that is coming we know there will
[1:11:16] be a millennium Reign on this Earth
[1:11:19] where we will live with God where we
[1:11:21] will talk with him where we would we
[1:11:23] won't have anything you know
[1:11:26] um of this worldall that that's that's
[1:11:29] that that bothers us we have everything
[1:11:31] in
[1:11:32] Perfection now when you understand
[1:11:35] purpose it pours you into
[1:11:39] action that's the thing about purpose
[1:11:42] it's not just an
[1:11:43] information when you understand purpose
[1:11:45] it poures you into action now we can
[1:11:48] look at a few characters in The Bible
[1:11:51] one of them was Moses we know the story
[1:11:53] of Moses Moses was born as a deliverer
[1:11:57] at a time when the children of Israel
[1:12:00] were in Egypt God had already told
[1:12:04] Abraham a time will come your seed will
[1:12:07] be strangers in a foreign land and
[1:12:09] they're going to be there for 400 years
[1:12:11] and after 400 years I'm going to bring
[1:12:13] them out andram told us that story
[1:12:15] teaching on Moses as he like really
[1:12:18] dramatized it my kids we'll call that
[1:12:20] one of the best sermons for kids to
[1:12:21] listen to because it was really really
[1:12:23] good uh uh brother brah did a good job
[1:12:25] of
[1:12:26] dramatizing but he told us that amram
[1:12:28] and J the parents of Moses they had been
[1:12:31] praying to God for a deliverer just like
[1:12:33] the rest of
[1:12:35] Israel now when they prayed to God for
[1:12:39] deliverance God had a set time for that
[1:12:42] deliverer to come and then at that set
[1:12:44] time God told Abraham I am going to
[1:12:46] bring the deliverer through your
[1:12:49] family now when God brought that
[1:12:51] deliverer it was at the time when the
[1:12:54] king of Egypt also said that all the
[1:12:56] Jewish babies should be
[1:12:59] killed but God gave them
[1:13:01] wisdom to hide those
[1:13:04] baby and eventually they had to let the
[1:13:07] baby go and in letting the baby go are
[1:13:11] you with me this morning I see a few
[1:13:14] people
[1:13:14] sleeping let's let's let's praise the
[1:13:16] Lord let's let's clap let's let's give a
[1:13:18] a huge Shout to the Lord this morning
[1:13:26] praise the Lord
[1:13:31] hallah we're in church we only here for
[1:13:33] a few hours don't worry I won't keep you
[1:13:35] late it's only
[1:13:38] 10:00 we started so early today don't
[1:13:41] worry I have my watch here so I would
[1:13:43] look at the one other the
[1:13:45] back but we found
[1:13:47] Moses becoming the son of Pharaoh's
[1:13:51] daughter now here's where I'm going when
[1:13:55] the mother of Moses the first one we
[1:13:58] know started to carer for her son and
[1:14:01] got paid for it she used that
[1:14:04] opportunity to reveal the purpose of
[1:14:07] Moses life to
[1:14:09] him Fifth
[1:14:13] Gospel she told Moses you are not an
[1:14:17] Egyptian you are born a deliverer
[1:14:21] amen and although Moses could not
[1:14:24] understand how how God was going to
[1:14:26] bring that to pass in his
[1:14:29] life that purpose was pushing
[1:14:32] him he pushed him to a point when he was
[1:14:35] 40 years
[1:14:36] old Moses was out and he saw an Egyptian
[1:14:41] and an Israelite
[1:14:43] fighting and because of the purpose in
[1:14:45] him the Revelation that he was born to
[1:14:48] be a deliverer it did not wait for God's
[1:14:51] time we know that was wrong but it spot
[1:14:55] him into
[1:14:56] action I'm here to deliver those people
[1:15:00] that's the power of
[1:15:02] purpose
[1:15:04] Samson the Bible told us when the angel
[1:15:07] appeared to his parents they told him
[1:15:10] that this son that will be conceived in
[1:15:12] you will be the deliverer he going to
[1:15:15] deliver Israel from the
[1:15:17] Philistines right and I don't want to go
[1:15:20] into all the the details of Samson's
[1:15:23] life but here's where I want to go to
[1:15:25] Samson understood the purpose for his
[1:15:27] life and at the final moment of his life
[1:15:32] where it looked as if that purpose would
[1:15:34] not be fulfilled remember he was born to
[1:15:36] destroy the
[1:15:38] Philistines and when he looked as if
[1:15:40] that purpose will not be fulfilled
[1:15:42] Samson came to himself and prayed to God
[1:15:46] and said please let me Avenge the
[1:15:49] Philistines of my two
[1:15:51] eyes and the Bible told us that those
[1:15:53] that he killed that day
[1:15:55] were more than all that he killed in all
[1:15:58] of his
[1:16:00] life there's a woman in the Bible called
[1:16:05] Esther she was a slave girl that had
[1:16:08] been
[1:16:10] brought to the land of the
[1:16:13] Chans and whilst she was
[1:16:17] there for some reason that we don't know
[1:16:21] the queen that was on the seat at the
[1:16:23] time disobeyed the king and the King was
[1:16:25] looking for another
[1:16:27] queen now when Esther went into the
[1:16:30] palace Esther did not have a full idea
[1:16:34] of the purpose why God placed that in
[1:16:36] the
[1:16:37] palace how do I know
[1:16:40] that when hamus planned to destroy the
[1:16:44] Jews and Mori heard about it and Mori
[1:16:48] sent Messengers to Esther and said
[1:16:51] Esther this is what what what aamas is
[1:16:55] planning hman sorry not hammers I I was
[1:16:58] wondering why it looked so
[1:17:00] recent I don't I don't know if they are
[1:17:02] from the same
[1:17:04] family but it was a
[1:17:06] hman and you know Esther was given that
[1:17:09] information hman has plans to destroy
[1:17:11] the Jews she was fearful At first she
[1:17:15] gave
[1:17:16] excuses I can't go into the king unless
[1:17:19] I'm called it's not time to go but let's
[1:17:23] listen to what morai said to
[1:17:27] her I call this one of the greatest
[1:17:31] messages it was just a couple verses of
[1:17:33] scripture am but I was great enough to
[1:17:37] make her understand that you are here
[1:17:39] for a purpose Moni told Esther after all
[1:17:43] th excuses for if thou altogether
[1:17:46] holdest thy peace at this
[1:17:49] time then shall their enlargement and
[1:17:52] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:17:54] another another place but thou and thy
[1:17:57] father's house shall be
[1:17:59] destroyed and who knoweth whether thou
[1:18:02] has come to the kingdom for such a time
[1:18:06] as
[1:18:08] this when Esther heard
[1:18:10] that she understood that
[1:18:13] purpose amen she wasn't there to show
[1:18:16] how pretty the King was I know I've
[1:18:17] preached on the beauty of Jesus Christ
[1:18:21] using King aerus
[1:18:26] as a type of Christ and Esther as a type
[1:18:29] of the bride and Esther being the one in
[1:18:33] whose body you could see the beauty of
[1:18:35] the
[1:18:36] king but our purpose was more than that
[1:18:40] her purpose was to be a
[1:18:44] deliverer and sisters you might think
[1:18:47] you are the weaker vessel but you don't
[1:18:49] know the extent to which the Lord can
[1:18:51] use
[1:18:52] you if only you surrender to him amen
[1:18:56] when Esther heard those
[1:18:59] words then Esther B them return Modi
[1:19:02] this
[1:19:03] answer go gather together all the Jews
[1:19:07] that are present in Shan and fast you
[1:19:10] for me and neither eat nor drink three
[1:19:13] days night or day I also and my maidens
[1:19:17] will Fast likewise and so I will go in
[1:19:20] unto the King which is not according to
[1:19:23] the law and if I perish I
[1:19:28] perish when you discover your purpose
[1:19:31] you will realize that your purpose is
[1:19:33] greater than your
[1:19:37] life the Saints of old we just sang the
[1:19:40] song ancient words that verse
[1:19:45] said holy words long preserved to our
[1:19:49] walk in this world came to us through
[1:19:53] sacrifice is it sacrifice of bulls and
[1:19:56] Rams no it was sacrifice of the blood of
[1:20:00] men and
[1:20:02] women but they understood the purpose
[1:20:04] they were
[1:20:05] here they knew that they were here to
[1:20:07] stand for God and they counted their
[1:20:11] lives nothing before them they were
[1:20:14] willing to give their lives for the
[1:20:16] cause of the
[1:20:17] Gospel our Lord Jesus Christ also knew
[1:20:21] his purpose
[1:20:24] Amen in John N he told us you know he
[1:20:28] had healed a blind man that was blind
[1:20:31] from his birth and his disciples had
[1:20:34] come to him he had not healed him he had
[1:20:36] seen the blind man and the disciples had
[1:20:39] come to him to say this guy that is
[1:20:42] blind why was he blind who sinned was he
[1:20:46] his parents on he or him knowing that
[1:20:48] sin you know sickness could be as a
[1:20:50] result of sin and Jesus answered and
[1:20:53] said to them now neither have the man
[1:20:55] seen nor experienced but that the works
[1:20:59] of God should be made manifest in him
[1:21:02] now Jesus said this precious
[1:21:04] words I must work the works of him that
[1:21:07] sent
[1:21:08] me while it is
[1:21:12] day now Jesus was not just telling us
[1:21:15] the importance of purpose but he was
[1:21:18] making us understand that purpose is
[1:21:20] time bound
[1:21:24] if you don't carry out your purpose at
[1:21:27] the time that's been allotted for that
[1:21:29] purpose you can miss out on fulfilling
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:33] purpose now we have a promise brother
[1:21:36] Braham said that anything that fulfills
[1:21:39] the purpose of God will be in the
[1:21:45] resurrection are you understanding how
[1:21:47] important purpose
[1:21:49] is Jesus Christ said while it is day the
[1:21:53] night cometh when no man can work as
[1:21:56] long as I am in the world I am the light
[1:21:58] of the world Amen now John told us in
[1:22:02] first John
[1:22:03] 38 said he that committed sin is of the
[1:22:05] devil for the devil sinned from the
[1:22:07] beginning he now told us the purpose of
[1:22:10] the son of man for this purpose the son
[1:22:13] of man was
[1:22:15] manifested that he might
[1:22:17] destroy the works of the
[1:22:20] devil now we don't have the son of man
[1:22:23] here in flesh any
[1:22:25] anymore but in whose flesh is the son of
[1:22:29] man who only mine is it just
[1:22:34] me only 20% raised their hands let's see
[1:22:39] how many more how many more okay all of
[1:22:42] us
[1:22:44] yeah so we also have a
[1:22:46] purpose and that purpose is to destroy
[1:22:49] the works of the
[1:22:51] devil in our lives in the lives of
[1:22:57] others now as a minister of the Gospel
[1:23:00] by the grace of God I also ask myself
[1:23:03] what's the
[1:23:05] purpose of the gift that God has placed
[1:23:07] in my
[1:23:09] life and in my
[1:23:11] search and I'm saying this you know in
[1:23:13] not
[1:23:15] honesty trusting that the Lord will
[1:23:18] continue to fulfill that
[1:23:20] and maybe continue to make it happen
[1:23:23] that way but I believe that God wants me
[1:23:27] to bring his Believers to the knowledge
[1:23:29] of the
[1:23:32] truth because there's a reason why he
[1:23:34] placed the
[1:23:36] fivefold my purpose might be different
[1:23:39] from an evangelist's purpose an
[1:23:41] evangelist might come here raise your
[1:23:43] faith everyone is jumping and shouting
[1:23:45] that is what God called them to
[1:23:47] do but when I come I want to be sure
[1:23:51] that the spirit of God can help me as
[1:23:54] brother br said he was talking about
[1:23:56] those that have a Teaching Ministry he
[1:23:58] said they will take these things that
[1:24:00] I'm teaching you I'm telling you
[1:24:02] preaching to you and show you where they
[1:24:04] are in the
[1:24:10] Bible Paul told Timothy he said for this
[1:24:12] is good and acceptable in the sight of
[1:24:14] God our savior who will have all men be
[1:24:16] saved and to come unto the knowledge of
[1:24:19] the truth so it's something that I will
[1:24:22] want us to all do
[1:24:24] in all the callings of Our Lives In
[1:24:27] Everything we are called to do when you
[1:24:29] at work at home as a son as a daughter
[1:24:33] as a father as a mother what is the
[1:24:36] purpose for
[1:24:38] this now let's go to the topic for
[1:24:42] today when those Pharisees came and
[1:24:44] tempted
[1:24:47] Jesus Jesus took them back to the
[1:24:51] beginning right amen amen Jesus took
[1:24:55] them back to the
[1:24:57] beginning why brother Braham said that
[1:24:59] Genesis is the SE chapter of the
[1:25:03] Bible how important is a
[1:25:06] seed very important right can you get
[1:25:09] crops without seeds no if the seed has
[1:25:13] not no life in it are you going to get
[1:25:15] crops no so what Jesus was showing us is
[1:25:19] if you go back to Genesis you will see
[1:25:22] the why for everything
[1:25:26] but remember it's there and
[1:25:30] hidden now what happened in the
[1:25:33] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:25:35] the Earth God made animals from the dust
[1:25:38] we know he told the animals to come from
[1:25:40] the earth and he made them male and
[1:25:43] female and God blessed it was at that
[1:25:46] time that after God made man the spirit
[1:25:48] man God blessed and said be fruitful and
[1:25:51] multiply so way before Eve was formed
[1:25:55] God has already talked about
[1:25:59] procreation before marriage
[1:26:03] happened is someone getting something
[1:26:06] this
[1:26:07] morning I know some people are not
[1:26:09] married
[1:26:11] yet but you can keep this in the back
[1:26:15] pocket because if you know the purpose
[1:26:17] for it you will go into it the right
[1:26:21] way not just that you will have the
[1:26:23] right expect
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:30] greatest thing that causes divorces
[1:26:32] today is people go into marriage with a
[1:26:35] wrong
[1:26:39] expectation because if you go with the
[1:26:41] right expectation if you know the
[1:26:42] purpose for it then it will be easier
[1:26:46] for you to wither the
[1:26:48] storms because it's also designed as we
[1:26:51] going to see I'm going ahead of myself
[1:26:53] if you're sleeping I'm going going ahead
[1:26:54] of
[1:26:55] [Laughter]
[1:26:57] myself because it's designed to be
[1:27:04] Rocky why is it designed to be
[1:27:06] Rocky because as we are going to
[1:27:09] see for this cause which
[1:27:13] cause Paul started to tell us that the
[1:27:17] actual purpose of marriage is so that
[1:27:20] marriage on Earth can reflect Christ and
[1:27:23] the church
[1:27:26] when you got saved that was the
[1:27:28] relationship with Christ and the church
[1:27:29] before you got
[1:27:30] saved with you and Christ what was the
[1:27:33] relationship were you always obeying him
[1:27:36] were you do were you doing things that
[1:27:37] pleased him no so I'm going ahead myself
[1:27:42] but we'll get there so God made Man In
[1:27:44] His Image the Bible said male and female
[1:27:48] created he them so the spirit man that
[1:27:52] God made had the masculine and The
[1:27:58] Feminine and then we realize that God
[1:28:01] then formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:28:04] Earth in Genesis chapter 2 and he put
[1:28:07] that Spirit which had the masculine and
[1:28:10] The Feminine in this flesh body that he
[1:28:13] formed which he called
[1:28:16] Adam now where we read in
[1:28:22] Genesis Genesis what Genesis 2 yeah
[1:28:26] Genesis 2 it said it is not good for man
[1:28:30] to be
[1:28:31] alone and then he formed the woman
[1:28:35] brother brah told us that God then took
[1:28:38] out the feminine
[1:28:40] spirit and plac it in the
[1:28:44] woman now immediately God did that it
[1:28:47] became a law of
[1:28:51] contrast the way I like to describe
[1:28:54] cribe this is if you have a gadget that
[1:28:57] uses two
[1:28:59] batteries One
[1:29:02] battery the positive will face the north
[1:29:04] the negative will face the
[1:29:07] South the other battery you will make
[1:29:09] sure that the negative is facing the
[1:29:11] North and the positive is facing the
[1:29:14] South so they are in opposite
[1:29:17] direction but without the two of them
[1:29:19] being in that state you can't have power
[1:29:27] now brother Bram told
[1:29:28] us that God
[1:29:31] made the woman he took the Bible told us
[1:29:34] took out the reap made the woman brother
[1:29:36] Braham said he took the feminine Spirit
[1:29:37] put in the woman brah also made us to
[1:29:40] know that you marry who you
[1:29:45] are why because that feminine Spirit
[1:29:48] used to be in you I don't know when so
[1:29:50] don't ask
[1:29:52] me but he used to be in
[1:29:55] you now you realize that you're
[1:29:57] attracted to people that have similar
[1:29:59] values as
[1:30:01] you it's just natural but the reason is
[1:30:04] that way is that feminine Spirit used to
[1:30:08] be in the
[1:30:09] man now brother Ram said in hear ye
[1:30:13] him he said God here was going to do
[1:30:15] something that he will ask man to do and
[1:30:19] God will never ask you to do anything
[1:30:21] that he would not do himself did you
[1:30:23] ever think of that did you ever go back
[1:30:24] to the Garden of Eden in the great
[1:30:27] coming forth of Adam and Eve the Bible
[1:30:28] said that Adam was not deceived Adam was
[1:30:31] not deceived he knowed just exactly what
[1:30:34] he was doing but because of the love
[1:30:36] that he had for Eve he walked right into
[1:30:39] death with her not because he add two he
[1:30:44] know difference Paul told us Adam was
[1:30:48] not deceived it was the woman that was
[1:30:49] deceived she was the one in the
[1:30:51] transgression and brother Ram is saying
[1:30:53] the same thing here Eve was absolutely
[1:30:56] deceived she thought she was right but
[1:30:59] Adam knowed better but he walked out
[1:31:02] with her and took death with
[1:31:05] her so we start to see that the very
[1:31:09] first thing that was displayed in
[1:31:12] marriage was
[1:31:15] Redemption now brother brah said in
[1:31:17] adoption number two he said now but he
[1:31:21] wanted to put things in time he had to
[1:31:22] make something to wash ship so his
[1:31:24] attributes produced this then he made
[1:31:26] man he's talking about God then in this
[1:31:28] man he looked lome so now to show now
[1:31:31] his great
[1:31:33] mind what he had in picture of Christ
[1:31:37] and the
[1:31:39] church now he told us that God had a
[1:31:42] threefold purpose which was a mystery
[1:31:46] now as God started to reveal that
[1:31:48] purpose we talked about the first one he
[1:31:50] wanted to come down and be able to be uh
[1:31:53] be in person with man which he did that
[1:31:56] in Jesus Christ the second one he wants
[1:31:58] to have the preeminence and in having
[1:32:01] the preeminence he wants to start to
[1:32:03] display his attributes in human beings
[1:32:07] one of those attributes was he had a
[1:32:09] bride that he
[1:32:12] loved when she was yet in
[1:32:16] sin the Bible said whilst we are yet
[1:32:19] sinners God loved us so the first
[1:32:23] display of that was Adam Adam loved his
[1:32:27] wife when she was yet in
[1:32:31] sin she had committed
[1:32:34] adultery according to the law she was to
[1:32:37] be put away we know that was before the
[1:32:41] law but he still the same God that gave
[1:32:43] the
[1:32:44] law but to show us Redemption from the
[1:32:48] very
[1:32:49] beginning we saw him brother BR said he
[1:32:52] went into death
[1:32:55] to get his wife back and is telling us
[1:32:58] that God had a picture of Christ and the
[1:33:00] church in his great mind he took not a
[1:33:03] different piece of clay and made a woman
[1:33:05] but he took from the side of Adam a reib
[1:33:07] and took from the spirit of Adam the
[1:33:09] feminis and put it in this reap but Rah
[1:33:13] told us they are two different spirits
[1:33:15] altoe but together they make one unit
[1:33:19] just like the example I get of the
[1:33:22] battery now but around to explain to us
[1:33:25] the difference in the spirit of man and
[1:33:28] the spirit of woman and this where
[1:33:29] brother Braham went and talked about
[1:33:31] women that want to be like men men that
[1:33:33] would want to be like women and said he
[1:33:34] ought not to be he said he made the
[1:33:37] Burly spirit for the man he made the
[1:33:39] tender little delicate feminist
[1:33:42] Spirit from for the woman in time tested
[1:33:46] Memorials of God he said he separated
[1:33:48] them in flesh and made them difference
[1:33:51] but joined them together
[1:33:54] and raising their children as
[1:33:59] one now this is where the problem
[1:34:02] is because we are different it brings
[1:34:07] tension everybody
[1:34:10] awake this is important now don't worry
[1:34:13] you're going to enjoy it it's going to
[1:34:14] be
[1:34:15] fun so let's look at the differences
[1:34:17] between how men and women
[1:34:21] think so this is not scripture
[1:34:24] but this
[1:34:25] is science this is studies right and
[1:34:28] I'll take the Liberty because brother br
[1:34:30] will also bring things from nature to
[1:34:32] type the
[1:34:34] spiritual when it comes to problem
[1:34:38] solving men are very solution oriented
[1:34:43] right they focus on facts logic and
[1:34:46] direct problem solving they look for a
[1:34:48] practical and efficient way to fix an
[1:34:51] issue if
[1:34:54] Brothers you know that if your wife
[1:34:55] comes and says I'm very overwhelmed it's
[1:34:58] been a busy
[1:34:59] day
[1:35:02] um your mind you're like yeah draw out a
[1:35:06] plan right plan your day and it should
[1:35:09] be easy
[1:35:10] right but women are more process
[1:35:15] oriented so they take a more holistic
[1:35:18] approach they will think about emotions
[1:35:21] relationships
[1:35:23] long-term consequences before making
[1:35:26] decisions so when my wife starts to tell
[1:35:30] me things about what's going on at work
[1:35:33] most of the time she's not asking me for
[1:35:37] feedback she just wants a listening here
[1:35:41] and someone to agree with her whether
[1:35:43] she's right or
[1:35:46] wrong right because God made us
[1:35:50] different when it comes to communication
[1:35:53] and expression men are more
[1:35:56] compartmental in the way they think and
[1:35:59] their thoughts are often more lineal so
[1:36:02] you know you tell a man to go do
[1:36:04] something that is what is in his head
[1:36:06] he's not able to juggle too many things
[1:36:09] together and brother Braham gave us his
[1:36:11] story and I want to say as well that I'm
[1:36:13] grateful to God that brother Braham told
[1:36:15] the stories that he
[1:36:17] told and don't let take them as just
[1:36:21] stories just like the Bible there are
[1:36:23] many stories in the Bible that you
[1:36:25] wonder why why were they put there right
[1:36:28] I I I wondered as a young child the
[1:36:30] story of the old prophet and the young
[1:36:34] Prophet right a prophet was told to do
[1:36:38] something don't go this way when you're
[1:36:41] coming right and then the old Prophet
[1:36:43] met him and said God told me to tell
[1:36:46] you why Weise he was deceiving him and
[1:36:49] the the young Prophet lost his life for
[1:36:50] that eaten up by a lion but those
[1:36:53] stories are there for us to learn from
[1:36:56] so brother Bram brought his life he he
[1:36:58] he told so many stories that were
[1:37:00] personal stories but there's a lot to
[1:37:02] learn from it so brother brah was
[1:37:03] telling us this story you have this in
[1:37:05] here we have no continuing City 1950 I
[1:37:08] like to read it so it was talking about
[1:37:10] sister hope his first wife right um
[1:37:13] about the time she was passing away and
[1:37:16] she said she was saying to brother BR
[1:37:17] don't let my babies be pulled about from
[1:37:19] Pillar To Post she said and some things
[1:37:22] I got to confess to you so brother BR
[1:37:24] said what is it he said do you remember
[1:37:26] one time and said you were going fishing
[1:37:29] and I called you and that night we were
[1:37:32] going to Fort way for a meeting I said
[1:37:35] yes she said you went to get me some
[1:37:38] stalkings I said yes I remember them she
[1:37:41] said them was the wrong kind of
[1:37:43] stalkings honey them wasn't right so
[1:37:47] what had happened is sister hope I told
[1:37:48] Brother Braham to go get her some
[1:37:50] women's
[1:37:52] socks and she had told Brother Bram the
[1:37:54] name
[1:37:56] Shor and brother Bram because men think
[1:38:00] lineal it's just straight we can't have
[1:38:03] too many things in our head brother Ram
[1:38:05] started repeating that to himself as he
[1:38:07] was going so he will not
[1:38:10] forget and he got to a point where he
[1:38:12] met someone on the road and they got
[1:38:14] into a conversation so he totally forgot
[1:38:17] what he was sent to
[1:38:18] buy and because you know it was Jess
[1:38:21] penes he was supposed to buy it from
[1:38:22] because he had forgotten
[1:38:24] he said well I can't go there I have to
[1:38:25] go somewhere where I can ask someone so
[1:38:27] he went to another store where he had a
[1:38:29] friend that was working and he got there
[1:38:31] and said oh that you know hope asked me
[1:38:34] to buy this H some stockings and the
[1:38:38] lady said no hope doesn't wear stockings
[1:38:40] I said no she does she actually do and
[1:38:43] said okay what are the types that you
[1:38:45] have and he said we have the chiffon and
[1:38:47] we have the rayon and said oh it's the
[1:38:49] rayon so let's give me that one well it
[1:38:52] was for old women
[1:38:54] that one and that's the one he bought
[1:38:56] but the lesson here is sister hope never
[1:38:59] scolded him for
[1:39:02] it right so short lesson for
[1:39:06] sisters we are not as smart as you
[1:39:09] are many times we actually act as if we
[1:39:13] are but we can't multitask like women
[1:39:17] can and I struggled with this I used to
[1:39:19] think I can multitask but when it comes
[1:39:22] to how we think we cannot multitask why
[1:39:25] are we talking about this differences
[1:39:27] because these differences are the things
[1:39:29] that causes conflict and
[1:39:33] tensions but I want you to know that it
[1:39:36] is in God's design amen for it to be
[1:39:39] like
[1:39:40] that because when we look at Christ and
[1:39:42] the church and we're going to get to
[1:39:44] what the role of Christ is and what the
[1:39:46] role of the church is and also type that
[1:39:48] the role of the husband and the role of
[1:39:50] the wife right let's at a few other
[1:39:54] examples emotional
[1:39:55] processing men like to
[1:39:59] compacte compact mentalize their
[1:40:02] emotions and just want to be sure I'm
[1:40:05] not yeah
[1:40:08] yeah and um so I
[1:40:11] mean they are IDE the we we are very
[1:40:14] very high level the way men think right
[1:40:18] we are more relying on logic as we make
[1:40:22] decisions well women are
[1:40:24] more
[1:40:26] integrated into having their thinking
[1:40:29] and emotions together right so when it
[1:40:32] comes to decision making women have a
[1:40:36] lot of emotions in their decision
[1:40:40] making so someone once talked about the
[1:40:42] nothing
[1:40:44] box how many brothers have asked their
[1:40:46] wife what's wrong with you and they get
[1:40:48] the answer
[1:40:51] nothing when a man when you ask a man is
[1:40:54] anything wrong with you and he says
[1:40:56] nothing most likely it's
[1:40:59] nothing but when a woman says
[1:41:03] nothing you better be
[1:41:06] wise right because of just how they
[1:41:12] are and I was hearing a preacher
[1:41:14] preacher and he was saying well he's not
[1:41:16] sure whether the sisters tell a lie or
[1:41:18] they're just expressing that it's
[1:41:20] nothing of your
[1:41:22] business or maybe it's nothing until you
[1:41:25] do something about it because you're
[1:41:27] supposed to go into our mind and figure
[1:41:29] what's going on and do something about
[1:41:32] it when it comes to risk taking and
[1:41:34] decision making men are very good at
[1:41:37] risk
[1:41:38] taking and we make very quick and
[1:41:42] impulsive
[1:41:43] decisions women want to spend time and
[1:41:46] think about it so when it comes to
[1:41:47] making decisions at home the man just
[1:41:50] goes yeah this is what we're going to do
[1:41:52] the woman is an the life in it taking
[1:41:54] our time and that's what happens when
[1:41:57] they go shopping as
[1:42:02] well I was reading somewhere brother Ram
[1:42:04] was talking about going shopping with
[1:42:05] sister MAA and how his legs were
[1:42:09] hurting and uh I felt well I'm not alone
[1:42:13] because to be honest I don't like going
[1:42:14] shopping with my wife cuz if I go
[1:42:17] shopping I get into the store I know
[1:42:19] where everything is I go get it and I
[1:42:21] come out but she goes and she's looking
[1:42:24] around and like we are not here to buy
[1:42:26] this but she's taking a look at it oh I
[1:42:28] just want to look at it why do you want
[1:42:30] to look at it we are not here for this
[1:42:32] right but that is how women
[1:42:36] think and if we understand that God made
[1:42:40] the feminist Spirit different from the
[1:42:41] masculine Spirit a lot of our problems
[1:42:44] will be
[1:42:46] solved how many brothers will say that
[1:42:50] their wives somewhat contribute to them
[1:42:53] coming late to
[1:42:55] church because they taking their time to
[1:42:57] get
[1:42:59] ready but it's not because they
[1:43:00] intentionally doing that
[1:43:03] sometimes I'll be honest I once felt
[1:43:05] like maybe my wife doesn't yet have the
[1:43:07] revelation of 30 minutes before
[1:43:10] service but that's not it because she's
[1:43:13] thinking
[1:43:15] more holistically she's emotions is
[1:43:19] there she's thinking about what food we
[1:43:21] we will have when we get back from
[1:43:22] church all L of those things are going
[1:43:24] on I'm not giving an excuse for sisters
[1:43:25] to make us come lat to church but I'm
[1:43:27] just saying that what is going on in our
[1:43:30] brain is different from what is going on
[1:43:32] in your brain cuz when you wake up you
[1:43:35] have things to do I get the car ready
[1:43:37] you know if you help with the kids which
[1:43:38] you should I'll do this and do this and
[1:43:41] do this and then you get it done faster
[1:43:43] than she does but she's thinking about
[1:43:45] many other
[1:43:46] things for the benefit of the
[1:43:51] family now God made us
[1:43:54] different I didn't hear the comment but
[1:43:57] it's
[1:43:58] okay God made us different so that the
[1:44:02] situation can be
[1:44:04] right for what Christ and the church
[1:44:08] should be so that the husband and the
[1:44:11] wife can be
[1:44:12] that now we have said that Adam was not
[1:44:17] deceived but he projected love why he
[1:44:22] projected love to redeem his
[1:44:26] bride now what I want you to get is he
[1:44:30] did not look at the state of his
[1:44:33] wife before he projected
[1:44:36] love which made it an
[1:44:40] unconditional
[1:44:44] love so what God requires of us as men
[1:44:48] is to love our wives
[1:44:52] unconditionally amen amen she listens to
[1:44:55] me I love her she doesn't listen to me I
[1:44:58] love her
[1:45:02] still because the purpose of marriage is
[1:45:05] to reflect Christ and the
[1:45:07] church and as I said before whilst we
[1:45:10] were yet
[1:45:11] sinners he loved us now brother BR said
[1:45:14] in Hebrews and we're going to see you
[1:45:16] know what he expects from the bride as
[1:45:18] well he said Grace is what God did for
[1:45:21] me works is what what I do for God said
[1:45:25] now they make a Doctrine out of it they
[1:45:27] think that the think that works that
[1:45:30] works is what wins your Merit if it is
[1:45:33] it isn't a free
[1:45:35] gift Grace is what God did for you by
[1:45:39] Grace you are saved and works is what
[1:45:42] you do in appreciation of the grace that
[1:45:47] he showed
[1:45:49] you and if you love him you like to do
[1:45:54] the works of the Lord so let me also say
[1:45:58] as you're going to see a few examples
[1:46:00] this morning the woman is
[1:46:03] called to serve a
[1:46:06] husband in
[1:46:09] appreciation of the man choosing her out
[1:46:12] of the many women that are in this
[1:46:15] world and that is also based on no
[1:46:18] conditions
[1:46:23] no
[1:46:27] conditions I'm going to challenge you
[1:46:29] all this morning with a few stories that
[1:46:31] brother bah
[1:46:33] told to make you know that your
[1:46:36] situation might not be the
[1:46:38] worst but there are people that have
[1:46:40] been in worse worse situations than
[1:46:42] you've been that decided to follow this
[1:46:47] principle and that turned around their
[1:46:49] marriage why because they went to the
[1:46:52] real purpose of
[1:46:54] marriage and Society focused on it but
[1:46:57] Ram continued to say here he said and if
[1:46:59] you love him you like to do the works of
[1:47:02] the Lord certainly because you love him
[1:47:05] he said accepting M the bro as my wife
[1:47:08] was what love done for
[1:47:13] her what she does in
[1:47:16] appreciation she's a nice woman stays
[1:47:19] home takes care of the children and
[1:47:21] leaves a good true life that's not
[1:47:24] because we are
[1:47:27] married we are married but she does that
[1:47:30] in
[1:47:32] appreciations if she runs downtown every
[1:47:36] day and took in every T store and up and
[1:47:40] down the street and never washed the
[1:47:42] dishes or anything else we are still
[1:47:47] married absolutely when I took my
[1:47:51] vow and we're going to visit that vow
[1:47:53] this
[1:47:54] morning when I took my vow that settles
[1:47:57] it she is my
[1:48:00] wife as long as there is life in us
[1:48:03] she's my wife that's her vow but what
[1:48:06] appreciation she does for that she stays
[1:48:10] home and takes care of the children and
[1:48:13] tries to be a real wife brother the
[1:48:17] Braham is saying I have no excuse not to
[1:48:19] love her because of what she does or
[1:48:21] what she fails to do
[1:48:26] I could run out and be gone all the time
[1:48:28] just guarding about over the country and
[1:48:31] let us have sta or anything let the
[1:48:33] children go without something to eat we
[1:48:36] are still
[1:48:38] married if she even divorces me I am
[1:48:42] still married long as there is life in
[1:48:45] my body I took that vow remember I said
[1:48:50] a lot of people go into marriage not
[1:48:52] knowing the purpose of marriage maybe
[1:48:55] not even meaning The Vow is why we have
[1:48:58] so many divorce
[1:49:00] cases till death we separate that's
[1:49:03] right we are still married but yet I
[1:49:05] make a poor excuse of a husband she
[1:49:08] would make a poor excuse as a wife so if
[1:49:11] we love one another we stick together
[1:49:16] and pull the load together amen said
[1:49:20] that's the way God and his church
[1:49:23] is for this cause what cause God and his
[1:49:29] church but Abraham said that is the
[1:49:33] antitype our marriages are the type
[1:49:37] which means we're going to give account
[1:49:38] one day for how well we try to mirror
[1:49:43] the
[1:49:45] antitype when you're born in the kingdom
[1:49:47] of God you'll have ups and downs true
[1:49:51] but you're still a Christian you still
[1:49:54] born of the spirit of
[1:49:57] God but brah gave us a few examples he
[1:50:01] told us something in when Divine love is
[1:50:04] projected Sovereign Grace takes its
[1:50:06] place and brother Bram was narrating
[1:50:09] something that happened at home in his
[1:50:13] house he had had sister Meer she was 37
[1:50:18] years old at that time and he said she
[1:50:21] was completely gray
[1:50:25] and he said she stood between me and the
[1:50:28] public and he said one day brother
[1:50:30] Braham had been praying for the sick not
[1:50:32] in church but those that came to his
[1:50:34] house said the entire basement of full
[1:50:37] was full of people you know the the
[1:50:39] living area was full of people he was
[1:50:41] praying for them and there were some
[1:50:43] Fanatics as well that continued to run
[1:50:45] around the building saying that God had
[1:50:48] told them to tell brother Braham
[1:50:49] something and brother Braham had done
[1:50:51] nothing about it
[1:50:54] and sister maida was taking care of the
[1:50:55] children but the whole house was in
[1:50:59] chaos so he said when he was done
[1:51:04] praying for the
[1:51:05] sick
[1:51:07] tired tired you can imagine what it is I
[1:51:11] haven't prayed for a lot of sick but out
[1:51:13] in the ministry I've had to do some
[1:51:16] prayers and depending on what demons
[1:51:18] you're dealing with you leave that place
[1:51:21] tired
[1:51:24] so imagine how tired brother Braham was
[1:51:28] brother Braham came back and he
[1:51:31] said he saw his
[1:51:33] wife she had her head in between her
[1:51:36] legs and she said the children hasn't
[1:51:39] had anything to it and I don't know what
[1:51:41] to
[1:51:42] do but the RAM said well I thought now
[1:51:46] there's just one thing to do now brother
[1:51:49] Braham had a choice he could have come
[1:51:52] back and said say don't you know how
[1:51:54] tired I am after praying for the sick
[1:51:58] and just to take care of this children
[1:51:59] you couldn't just do that for
[1:52:01] me but let's see what he did what he did
[1:52:05] said now there's just one thing to do
[1:52:06] now I am tired but I'm going to do
[1:52:11] this I was praying in his heart now
[1:52:13] heavenly father in my heart you help me
[1:52:17] to be what you would have me to be on
[1:52:20] this scene why why was he asking for
[1:52:23] God's help that is the
[1:52:26] model it's only Christ that can react to
[1:52:30] his bride when she was lost with
[1:52:34] love right but the Bon I thought now if
[1:52:37] I can just get her
[1:52:39] quiet so I said sweetheart will you rush
[1:52:42] out with me for
[1:52:45] dinner and she replied oh I'd have to
[1:52:47] clean up the children and this and that
[1:52:50] the BR said and you could hardly hear
[1:52:52] yourself think little Joseph just
[1:52:55] beating the floor as hard as he
[1:52:58] could Ram said so I sleeped
[1:53:01] over and got an apron a tired man sleept
[1:53:06] over got an apron put it around me and I
[1:53:08] begin to help her and I said honey you
[1:53:11] know what I saw the prettiest dress the
[1:53:14] other day I just wanted to get it for
[1:53:17] you and he was in a certain city just
[1:53:20] here closed and we'll go get it
[1:53:23] the ram said as he was doing that maybe
[1:53:24] helping with the dishes maybe helping to
[1:53:26] sweep the
[1:53:27] floor which we should all do as brothers
[1:53:30] maybe helping to
[1:53:32] cook which we should all
[1:53:36] do that is what Christ did for
[1:53:39] us and as husband that's what we should
[1:53:41] do for our
[1:53:43] wives said he was praying all the time
[1:53:45] Heavenly Father quieting this dear
[1:53:47] little woman and I put my hand on her
[1:53:50] not knowing her not knowing what I was
[1:53:52] doing doing he was praying in his heart
[1:53:54] she didn't know that what that's what he
[1:53:55] was doing I said yes honey what oh it
[1:53:58] was
[1:53:59] beautiful kept saying oh Lord quieten
[1:54:01] this little woman and just kept on you
[1:54:03] know her not knowing what was I doing
[1:54:07] was projecting creating a different
[1:54:13] atmosphere it's my duty to create the
[1:54:16] atmosphere in my home if the atmosphere
[1:54:19] is not right it's my responsibility
[1:54:23] I must own it and I must do something
[1:54:26] about it as you can tell this message is
[1:54:29] for me as well so he not a perfect
[1:54:32] brother Toby coming to pray to you I ask
[1:54:35] the Holy Spirit to speak to us I want to
[1:54:36] be spoken to as well so that my home can
[1:54:40] be different amen because there's a
[1:54:42] model that God has given to us and that
[1:54:45] is Christ and the bride but brah said
[1:54:49] walk in the love of God have Fellowship
[1:54:52] and in a few moments she got quiet and
[1:54:56] then when she got quiet Sarah and Becky
[1:54:59] divided up the play blocks Joseph got
[1:55:02] him something to play with and there was
[1:55:05] peace in the home amen why the Redeemer
[1:55:09] took his
[1:55:12] place the Redeemer stepped up and took
[1:55:16] his place and created a different
[1:55:20] atmosphere because he knew that that was
[1:55:22] his home
[1:55:23] home and then God giv his spirit and
[1:55:26] through that spirit with love to my
[1:55:28] family Sovereign Grace coming and
[1:55:31] quieten the family but Bram said he will
[1:55:34] do it I know it
[1:55:36] will now brother BR also told us in
[1:55:39] questions and answers he said this story
[1:55:41] a few
[1:55:42] times but in questions and answers
[1:55:45] number three someone had asked him a
[1:55:46] question and he was going to use the
[1:55:48] story of this Christian sister who had a
[1:55:51] drug card has a
[1:55:54] husband so the question that was asked
[1:55:56] brother Braham was this brother Braham
[1:55:59] how am I supposed to show my wife that I
[1:56:01] really care for her and yet stay with
[1:56:04] the
[1:56:05] word but still having a question like
[1:56:09] this said why don't you practice what
[1:56:12] you preach or believe so let me explain
[1:56:15] that are we still awake amen am we need
[1:56:19] something to wake us up let's shout
[1:56:21] hallelujah
[1:56:22] hallelujah praise the Lord praise the
[1:56:25] Lord don't worry I'll be done soon and
[1:56:27] I'm in it I know brother kyri says that
[1:56:29] a
[1:56:31] lot but I promise you I'll be done amen
[1:56:34] very
[1:56:36] soon now this question that was asked
[1:56:38] brother Braham a brother wrote to
[1:56:39] brother Braham and
[1:56:41] said how am I supposed to show my wife
[1:56:44] that I really care for her while staying
[1:56:48] with the word and still getting a
[1:56:51] question from the wife wife that says
[1:56:53] why not Practice What You
[1:56:57] Preach so it gave a sense that this
[1:56:59] man's life was not lining up with the
[1:57:02] word that he was trying to teach at home
[1:57:06] or trying to show that he has a
[1:57:08] relationship
[1:57:10] with now this is Brother braham's answer
[1:57:12] he said well well
[1:57:15] then sorry Brothers I'm sorry I didn't
[1:57:17] give you the quot but if you can find it
[1:57:19] that'll be good if not that's okay said
[1:57:21] well then if the wife if the wife is
[1:57:23] saying this to you she has a right to
[1:57:26] say it you better get right but Braham
[1:57:29] said if you are not preaching what you
[1:57:31] believe you better get
[1:57:34] right then if she's saying it just to be
[1:57:37] evil remember the Bible said it was
[1:57:39] better than a millstone was hang on your
[1:57:41] neck and drawn on the depth of the sea
[1:57:43] then even to offend the least of this my
[1:57:45] little on so let's say the scenario the
[1:57:48] wife is not a Believer the husband is
[1:57:51] and the woman is just you know trying to
[1:57:53] say that to be evil like why don't you
[1:57:56] practice what you
[1:57:58] preach so but brah said that wouldn't be
[1:58:00] good because she's putting herself in
[1:58:02] danger but brah said 115 and maybe that
[1:58:06] this wife is not that type of person
[1:58:09] maybe she's a different maybe she's a
[1:58:11] good person maybe she's just testing you
[1:58:14] to see what you'll do said now stay in
[1:58:17] love with her and let her see Jesus in
[1:58:21] you amen you do that see you just go on
[1:58:25] I give a little illustration this
[1:58:26] morning about a person one time this
[1:58:28] little woman had received the Holy Ghost
[1:58:31] she was a very sweet little person well
[1:58:34] she had had a hard life and her husband
[1:58:36] was an alcoholic and so she kept on she
[1:58:40] bore with him she says you want to go to
[1:58:42] church honey take off but now he went
[1:58:46] down to the salon down at Old Brown
[1:58:50] Debby down here going on so they hung
[1:58:53] out there all the time used to be boners
[1:58:57] many of you oldtimers here remember when
[1:58:59] boners had there um on the corner of
[1:59:02] it's called Brown Derby now I believe it
[1:59:04] is so hanging around down there and the
[1:59:06] first thing you know one night come up a
[1:59:08] question about church and Christians so
[1:59:10] this man and his friends hanging out all
[1:59:12] drinking and one of the old drunks
[1:59:14] sitting there said there a't no such
[1:59:16] thing as a Christian anymore and there's
[1:59:18] no certain thing all this bunch of
[1:59:20] Hypocrites you see them out out here
[1:59:22] smoking drinking doing something that we
[1:59:25] do and said call themselves Christian
[1:59:27] there's no such this one drunk raised up
[1:59:30] and said just a minute there is one that
[1:59:33] I know they said who is it said it's my
[1:59:36] wife see she had become salty he was
[1:59:40] catching it all the time he said no
[1:59:43] she's a Christian I prove it to you said
[1:59:45] I tell you what Let's do let's go up
[1:59:48] home and I'll show you whether she's a
[1:59:50] Christian or not said let's go up home
[1:59:52] and now let's really be drunk we're
[1:59:54] going to act like we're really drunk
[1:59:55] knocked at the door coming staggering
[1:59:58] over everything and and why the chair
[2:00:00] sitting around this way and everything
[2:00:02] and and she set them all on a chair and
[2:00:05] and his guest you know and try to make
[2:00:06] them just as welcome as could be said I
[2:00:10] want to fix you up some supper she went
[2:00:12] to fix some and said we want ham and
[2:00:15] eggs you know they had it so they fixed
[2:00:18] the ham and eggs when he got there at
[2:00:21] the table he looked at them picked up a
[2:00:23] plate and slammed the stuff on the
[2:00:26] floor said you know I don't like my HS
[2:00:28] like this come on boys let's get out of
[2:00:31] here
[2:00:32] anyhow but abam said they went out and
[2:00:35] sat down like that you know she came out
[2:00:39] she said dear I'm sorry I didn't get
[2:00:43] them fixed I'll fix some more for
[2:00:46] you oh nonsense you know I didn't want
[2:00:49] them that way in the first place just
[2:00:52] carrying on like that they went out
[2:00:54] there and sat down and act like they was
[2:00:56] drunk they heard her in there kind of
[2:00:59] sobbing to herself singing really low
[2:01:03] voice must Jesus bear the cross alone
[2:01:07] all the world go free there's a cross
[2:01:10] for everyone and there's a cross for me
[2:01:12] this consecrated cross I'll bear Till
[2:01:15] Death Shall Set Me
[2:01:16] Free one Drunk Cat looked at the other
[2:01:19] one said she's a Christian
[2:01:22] she's got it and that little woman let
[2:01:25] her
[2:01:26] husband possess others to Christ that
[2:01:29] night see why just be real sweet just
[2:01:33] remember he knows all about it says so
[2:01:37] sister brother whoever it might be or
[2:01:39] brother it's here cuz he asked about his
[2:01:41] wife you just be salty she'll get
[2:01:45] thirsty if there's anything in her to
[2:01:47] thirst for if it isn't remember if you
[2:01:52] got the wrong person you'll get the
[2:01:55] right one in the
[2:01:57] Millennium you just keep ongoing all
[2:02:01] wrongs will be made right don't look at
[2:02:04] your wife and say I'm just going to bear
[2:02:06] with you on this Earth I'll get another
[2:02:08] one in the
[2:02:10] Millennium I want to believe that the
[2:02:12] one you have today is the one you will
[2:02:14] be with in the Millennium brother Braham
[2:02:17] said we will be Eternal mats in glory
[2:02:21] I'll call the musicians As We rise on
[2:02:23] our feet this
[2:02:28] morning for this cause shall a man leave
[2:02:33] his father and his
[2:02:35] mother and be joined to his wife and
[2:02:39] they too shall become one
[2:02:42] flesh that cause is not for what we
[2:02:46] often think it is
[2:02:48] for it is to mirror Christ and and the
[2:02:52] church as we have heard Christ love his
[2:02:55] church
[2:02:57] unconditionally and because of that love
[2:03:00] she serves him
[2:03:07] unconditionally I want to bring to our
[2:03:10] remembrance for those that are married
[2:03:13] what the marriage vows would have
[2:03:15] been this or a variation of it if you're
[2:03:20] standing close to your wife your husband
[2:03:22] you can hold hands if you want to some
[2:03:25] of us can't I don't want to bring my
[2:03:26] wife
[2:03:29] here brother Barry is not here
[2:03:34] sorry but I want us to reflect on those
[2:03:37] words that you might have
[2:03:40] said or responded
[2:03:46] to however so many years
[2:03:50] ago this this is what would have been
[2:03:53] read to the husband will you have this
[2:03:56] woman to be your lawful weeded
[2:03:59] wife to live together in this holy state
[2:04:02] of
[2:04:03] matrimony do you promise to love and
[2:04:08] honor and
[2:04:10] cherish and
[2:04:12] support in sickness or health riches or
[2:04:18] poverty and will forsake all others
[2:04:22] as long as you both
[2:04:24] leave and the man will have said I
[2:04:28] will and this would have been asked the
[2:04:30] woman will you have this man to be your
[2:04:32] lawful weed husband to live together in
[2:04:35] this holy state of
[2:04:37] matrimony do you promise to love honor
[2:04:40] and cherish and support in sickness or
[2:04:44] health Riches of poverty and cleave thee
[2:04:48] only unto him as long as you both leave
[2:04:53] and the bride will have
[2:04:54] answered I
[2:05:00] do just reflecting on this as we have
[2:05:03] our eyes
[2:05:06] closed we might have failed in some
[2:05:10] way to be
[2:05:13] exact to what we vowed before God to
[2:05:19] do but is a merciful god
[2:05:24] and I believe this morning he has
[2:05:26] pointed our
[2:05:28] attention to the very reason that he
[2:05:31] instituted
[2:05:34] marriage and if we
[2:05:36] can go
[2:05:39] back and just do what he expects us to
[2:05:43] do following the model that he has
[2:05:46] placed before us of himself and his
[2:05:48] church then he can make all wrongs right
[2:05:53] again just going to offer this word of
[2:05:56] prayer for all of us that are married
[2:06:00] and maybe for those that yet to be
[2:06:01] married as well as God is bringing this
[2:06:04] to our remembrance just to
[2:06:07] know what the right expectation will be
[2:06:10] going into marriage whenever that time
[2:06:13] is if Christ
[2:06:16] ties we're going to ask the Lord he him
[2:06:21] that loved his bride he's also the one
[2:06:24] that gave his bride the ability to serve
[2:06:26] him in appreciation of that love that
[2:06:30] God will help us to focus on what is the
[2:06:33] primary
[2:06:34] reason for
[2:06:37] marriage and we know that when we
[2:06:39] discover the purpose it pours us into
[2:06:44] action there
[2:06:46] father we thank you for this precious
[2:06:50] words
[2:06:52] that were long
[2:06:54] preserved for our walk in this
[2:06:58] world you knew that we couldn't walk
[2:07:02] alone so you made sure that the word was
[2:07:04] there for
[2:07:05] us to guide us as a samon said Thy
[2:07:12] word is a lamp unto my feet and the lamp
[2:07:17] onto my
[2:07:19] path we cannot walk alone there
[2:07:23] Lord and Lord we confess that sometimes
[2:07:27] we are failed as husbands not to love
[2:07:30] our wives
[2:07:32] unconditionally as wives not to serve
[2:07:34] our husbands
[2:07:37] unconditionally we found
[2:07:39] excuses we have behaved in ways we ought
[2:07:42] not to and we ask that you forgive us
[2:07:45] there
[2:07:47] Lord Lord you're looking at marriages
[2:07:50] especially of believers
[2:07:52] and wanting to see that reflection of
[2:07:54] Christ and the church and we know we'll
[2:07:57] answer one
[2:07:59] day if we have done according to the
[2:08:03] pattern if we have built according to
[2:08:06] the
[2:08:08] blueprint Lord we just pray that you be
[2:08:11] our help there

[2:08:50] always go back there Lord Jesus may we
