just hanging there there and I was thinking it's a it's a time for Spiritual introspection um and the Bible admonishes us to self-reflect to think on our ways and um wherever we are today wherever I

[Music] name what a privilege it is to speak your name to know the gravity of your name amen yes so many people in this world just use your name so flippantly and we know that it's the design of Satan

Father thank you for all that you've done for us Lord we have so much to thank you for Lord Jesus oh Father we pray that you would just be glorified Lord we just ask that even just now that as we speak your name father oh Lord as we heard that song sing like the fragrance after a rain Lord we've come Desiring to be Washed by the Water of the word Lord we know that when it rains it's not the smell of the rain it's the smell of no more toxins in the air no no more dust in the air oh father that it's clean so it smells different and father we pray that when we leave this building today that we would smell different that we would be a sweet Savor unto you father Lord that the temples that your Holy Ghost lives in father that we would just be pleasing unto you father help us Lord we pray that we could just fall upon that rock today of Revelation Lord Jesus Oh Lord that it wouldn't fall upon us and grind us to powder but Lord Lord that we would willingly sacrifice ourselves fresh unto you once again Lord we know that even the first age messenger he said that I have to Die daily oh Father help us to die to ourselves Lord help us to die to our Traditions father to our understandings to our theories to our pet doctrines Lord and let us father just humble ourselves in your sight that you will pick us up today Father amen that you will have your will and your way in our lives father

musicians certainly wonderful to be in his [Music] presence thank you every everyone for your efforts certainly thank the Lord for his goodness and his Mercy my goodness what a tremendous thing it is if you have your Bibles today I'd like to take a scripture from John chapter 8 a little bit of a transition from where we have been in the past talking about the importance of Revelation but it truly is the importance of Revelation that will make a difference in our lives and not just Revelation brothers and sisters it's Revelation by the spirit exactly and not just Revelation by any spirit because there's a lot of spirits in this world and I'll tell you you know it but sometimes we need to say it there's a lot of religious Spirits in this world but it's Revelation by the Holy Spirit John chter 8 verse 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abra seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verily truly truly I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever amen if the sun therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you would just allow us father to be free that we could see this glorious Liberty in our lives Lord maybe from just a little bit of a different perspective today Father maybe like never before and Lord we pray that ultimately you would have the preeminence in our lives we just ask that you would bless this word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly happy to be back in Calgary we had uh a wonderful weekend last weekend two services at the end time message Tabernacle in Edmonton with brother Ed hammermeister and and the church Church there the Saints they send their greetings so God bless you uh just a few announcements we have a prayer meeting coming up on Thursday that's the 6th that will be here at the church and on the 15th which is a Saturday and the 16th which is a Sunday we have brother Cadre Diggs here we'll have a 6 PM service on Saturday and the regular Sunday morning service and then we have the youth service will be at our place after the service um with brother Cadre there on the 16th February 26th according to our bylaws we will have the men's meeting and that will be a Wednesday night and we're going to cancel the service and we will meet in the basement with the brothers so that will be February 26th we're going to have the annual General men's meeting and uh just a confirmation as well so we can begin to plan I'm going to advertise it as we get closer but I'm just going to mention it as we go uh September the 12th 13th and 14th we have confirmed brother Andrew Glover for this year so I know last year it was a bit of a struggle because it was at the end of the summer when I had him come and many people were away for one last Harrah in the summer and so I asked him if we could arrange something after everybody gets back to normal again so we can have a a full service so we have a long time to plan I trust that it will be a blessing if you desire to be here uh Lord willing um it should be a wonderful week weend of services and I think as we go forwards probably what will happen is uh it's going to get very busy here that weekend because a lot of people like to come and hear Brother Andrew Glover so uh Mark that in your calendars it's actually I don't know if it's on the church calendar but it will be if you uh desire to see it so any questions by all means just reach out just have a quick note here for tax receipts for 2024 for qualified donations received in 24 by Calgary Living Word assembly will be issued on the week of February the 17th 2025 I know many people will be preparing their taxes even maybe some right now at this time but uh just an update from the treasurer and uh trust that the Lord will continue to bless each one for your contributions I have been a bit negligent and I apologize with the birthdays so I'm just going to go back to where I left off that's what the the prophet said right when you get off track just go back to where you left off so where I left off was in January the 6th it's absolutely terrible it's an entire month there was three birthdays prior to that but January 6th sister Amanda panicker January the 9th was Justice brother Justice Oli and January the 9th was Brother Joseph panicker January the 17th was Sister Glend D at qan the 20th sister Linda dick the 22nd was Sister Naomi kabanda the 22nd was benjam brother Benjamin panicker the 24th was brother Daniel oonoo the 26th was Sister Roda odoo the 27th was Sister Ruth aidu the 29th was brother Ezekiel Abassi the 30th was Sister Mary olarte and the 31st was Brother Joseph egg Mana God richly bless each one of you happy Birthday now February February thei is brother Zion vard February the 4th with Sister Sarah panicker February the 5th sister e aala February the 7th is brother Andrew sarpong brother uh sorry February the 7th is brother Chris Young I don't know if he's here today haven't seen him for a while uh February the 7th is Sister Esther o Jessa God bless you and happy birthday to you I just want to uh throw this out there brothers and sisters please forgive me if I don't mention your name in any capacity if ever that happens it's not because I don't love you it's not because I don't pray for you it's just because maybe I get anxious and distracted and I forget that's all I know sometimes the devil could come around and say well brother never prayed for me while I was away or brother never mentioned my birthday or whatever that that's not the case that I don't actually love you and care for you I pray for each one by name so um moving forward hopefully I'll keep on top of this birthday thing it sounds really easy and it should be but I get distracted and nervous so anyways I think it's wonderful to be here today we uh clearly heard that I believe like brother Fen said we're being called a little higher you believe you can be blessed in a song service people can be healed in a song service brothers and sisters we're witnesses to that right here in this building and we know this building has nothing to do with it but the spirit that comes into this building with each and every member here has everything to do with it the spirit that we bring makes the difference in the services right are we working on that Spirit the night before or are we out with the world the night before it makes a difference it really does but you know I I just think it's wonderful it made me take some notes in the back when brother Fen was was expressing what God put on his heart it is is is being called higher is it in the preaching brothers and sisters is the preaching necessary to come a little higher cuz if it is I say Lord let it be we want it to go higher and I think it is because we're on a journey God wants all of us to come a little higher amen is it in the music is it in the music to come a little higher I know many people some people maybe not many would say sure it isn't the music the music program needs to get a little better but you know what happens is I've noticed is usually those comments come from the people that never play music it's interesting how that works but it's true is it in the music does that need to come a little higher is it in the preaching that come a little higher is it in the conduct does that need to come a little higher it just makes me wonder I I'm not saying anything I'm not saying one way or the other I'm saying that God saying come a little higher he told John a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a door open in heaven he saw it and he said come a little higher what did that mean it didn't mean to get popped up it meant to get a little more Revelation Hallelujah get a little more Revelation about the word and what that word means to us and you know I just couldn't help but think you know is it in the preaching is it in the music is it in the conduct alls I could think about is it starts with me and sure enough many people would say you're right brother Barry it starts with you you're the pastor and I take that I say yes it does I'm the shepherd I'm supposed to sleep at the door I'm supposed to smell like the Sheep I'm supposed to know them by name I'm supposed to know what's going on with them but I can't help but think brothers and sisters it starts with me we need to look in the mirror and say it starts right here this is where that calling going higher starts is right here are we willing to put ourselves in that position or are we just fine and say hey you know what I made it I know that if elected if I'm predestinated by God before the foundation of the world and I'm just going to be there anyway so I could just eat drink and be marry because tomorrow I die I'll never be lost you know what the spirit of Christ constrains us to always strive for a little more am that's the believer's position in Christ brothers and sisters is to die out daily Paul the first age messenger he was the pattern for the church said I Die daily are we dying daily this is all just from a couple minutes in the back my Hallelujah I just can't help but think you know we just need to say Lord where am I genuinely sincerely Lord where am I is my experience gone cold is my experience gone distracted is my experience wrong search me and try me the seventh angel messenger said that in the invisible Union of the Bride when he prayed he said Lord search me and try me am so what's our desire amen how do we measure up with the word brothers and sisters I just want to I just want to try and encourage us this morning to think why let's take an inventory let's see where we're at if we keep do if we want more we have to do more and maybe not necessarily more labor more effort what we have to do is maybe just adjust what we do CU if we keep doing the same thing we're going to keep getting the same results if we want to see different results let's try new things am you know uh just a little bit of housekeeping I have to mention here about the church I just want to remind us that I'm going into a study of church doctrine Church order conduct order and Doctrine cood we'll be going into various aspects of it and uh I'm certainly excited about it because there's so much in there and it's not just about the natural and the building even though it is very much it's very much about the Tabernacle yes the building that we're in so I I just want to talk about perceived expectations versus communicated expectations and I think it's been a very long time since we've actually communicated the the expectations of what we want to see in this building and it's according to church doctrine conduct order and Doctrine what what the prophet said and you know I brought it up in the past and I'll I'll continually bring this up to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance but you know the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a pretty sacred place the children of Israel recognized that's where God Elohim came down and met with the people met with Moses Moses was given the very specific instructions to build the Tabernacle to very specific details if you haven't read that recently it's a really interesting read there's no question about the way God wanted that Tabernacle built right to the finest details and we know that there was three courts there was the outer Court there was the inner court and then there was the holy of holies it's the holy place is what it's called in the Bible and we call it the the the holiest or the holy place there's many different descriptions of it but in that place behind that Veil is where the high priest met with the spirit of God met with the Lord Elohim and today we know that when Jesus died at Calvary what was the very first order of business for him before he went up before he went down the first order of business for him before he actually departed from the Earth was to go right to the Tabernacle as his custom was right and this time to preach a different gospel this time to set the example that that Veil that was blocking man from God is now torn from the bottom to the top fully there's no more Veil that's what he went to the temple to do to show man that now once upon a time it was death to go behind that Veil Uninvited but now to not go behind that Veil is death amen that's right amen so brothers and sisters when we come to this building here this is behind that Veil amen that's right we've heard about the pillar of fire and many people probably wonder I sure would like to see that Pillar of Fire I would say I'd sure like to see that Pillar of Fire you know in in certain Circ cumstances I think maybe I've seen a little bit of it I don't know maybe someone here could say I've seen it brother and have a whole testimony about it I'd love to hear it and I'm not mocking you at all I'm saying that Pillar of Fire is 100% real and some people have the ability to see it some people are blessed to be able to see it but you know that Pillar of Fire it's not something that's sitting in here waiting for us it's not on a picture on a wall and and and it's just here waiting for us that Pillar of Fire is the Holy Ghost Inside of us amen and when we come together and are in unity of spirit in one mind and one Accord in reverence to the word that that little tiny licks of fire come together and make one big Pillar of Fire and that's where brothers and sisters we can come in you know brother bradam said we should be able to ch ch challenge any Joe Lewis Spirit to walk through those doors any cancer Spirit to walk through those doors they won't be able to stand the presence of almighty God of that Pillar of Fire yes but it's all about our approach amen where do we stand with our approach do we come to church just looking for a a denominational experience or are we actually coming into the Temple of the most high God now it's an absolute Paradox because naturally speaking this building here is I would say not a very good building maybe it's a a golden oldie it used to be an old uh Community Center I think maybe at one point it was a church it was like built in 19 I think 12ish there's a whole lot of documentation in the uh Community Hall just north of here about this building very specifically it's had many Renovations it's had many different things go through it but this is where we we find it now today once upon a time we actually got this building we were able to get this building and when we got this building we as a body of Believers got this building it wasn't just our doing it was God giving it to us God gave us this building as a place of worship right and you know even though he gave it to us we still had to March yes yes we still had to have brothers and sisters offered to take pledges above and beyond what their tithes were above and beyond what their offerings were there had to be a few people come together and say we're willing to actually put our shoulder to the wheel financially to make this happen and and brother Ken Let It Go for a while until we got into the building and things settled down and then he actually canceled it he said no the church can pay for it it was a wonderful thing but what I'm getting at brothers and sisters Is Not only was there the financial commitment which was above and beyond there was also the physical commitment those people who are around at the time remember once upon a time in the basement we had water and and we had to actually physically work to fix that problem we renovated this whole entire Upper Floor it took a lot of work there was a contractor involved with it but there was still a lot of volunteer hours on the side all of the painting all of the lights there was so much that went into it what I'm getting at brothers and sisters is this building didn't just happen someone didn't just go like this and we had a building it wasn't just given it to us by a contractor from the mother's ship because we're Associated to another denomination we actually had to March forward to get this building am so where I'm going is we want to talk about the perceived expectations and communicated expectations I don't think there's been communicated expectations for a very long time so I just want to try and Center us a little bit more bring us back to the middle so we can actually make sure that we're all understanding what the expectations are when we come to the house of the Lord we talked about it a little while ago in terms of dress and I think that needs to be mentioned I'm not going to harp on that today but what I do want to harp on is a little bit about our conduct in the building here we ask that everyone would please take pride in what we have here amen and and I know for the most part everyone does yes but there's some situations that we've encountered where you can see that maybe the the the perceived expectation just doesn't line up with what should be communicated maybe it's it's the expectation that hasn't ever been said but sometimes you think maybe you don't have to say it I mean but here we are we find ourselves this way so let's just go forwards together as a body of Believers there's there's some in kindergarten and there's some with phds well on graduated who have authored books many people from many different various walks and backgrounds right but if anybody's wondering about it I'm just going to say it plainly like I did before this sanctuary the basement of the church is no place to be clipping your fingernails if you want to clip your fingernails go outside let your fingernails go outside that's right the sanctuary the Temple of the most high God is not the place to clip your fingernails now why are you saying that brother Barry CU somebody was someone found a nest of fingernails in the in the sanctuary I'm just going to be plain don't do it it's not polite if that's if that's what brothers and sisters think what does God think right Y what I want to say today is specifically remember the sanctuary is Holy we want to keep this space holy we want to give this space to be a hallowed space we know that we bring the Holy Ghost he doesn't live here but you know we had a prophet I would say this we had the holy ghost in the prophet say that even a child running in the sanctuary can upset the Holy Ghost for future services so if a child running if you think about this un God said unless you come to me as a little child you'll in no wise enter the Kingdom so so think about how the word is the child has Earnest Behavior the child is not looking to just go and and run around and and like we heard about One Church they would do with the youth is play dodgeball in the sanctuary the child isn't actually going to do that the child is in Earnest just maybe running out of the sanctuary we had the prophet say even that can upset the Holy Ghost let's consider ourselves when we gather together in the sanctuary brothers and sisters when we gather together in this building the basement is an extension of this the basement downstairs is an extension of the sanctuary if anybody has any questions about that please come and talk about it it's important for us to remember this the basement is an extension of this Sanctuary that's why we have TVs there that's why we have the sound there so we can take our children maybe if they're a little squirmy here maybe if they need a drink maybe if they have to go to the bathroom whatever they just can't sit still we want to take them downstairs and take them out of the service so they're not distracting those around us for the record I don't get distracted very easy I can preach through a screaming child Kicking and Screaming being taken out the door that's fine that's not an issue for me but where it becomes an issue is for the parents and people sitting around where there's a child that's right that's got a crinkly bag or they've got something they're doing and it's making some sort of little noise that can drive people crazy to the point where they can't actually focus on the word right as parents it's our responsibility to make sure that we're being vigilant about that that and if you want a comparison think about how we would be if we went and got and sat down in the presence of prime minister trudo in his cabinet would we behave the same way with our children in front of him that sometimes we do in the Church of the Living God would our children be allowed to make noises would they be allowed to squirm around I think not I think we would probably get a little bit embarrassed and think I better get this kid out of here because they're just distracting people and if we don't think that way I just want to encourage us try and think that way because you're not distracted the preaching you're distracting your brothers and sisters that's all yes the basement is an extension of the sanctuary please remember that if we're going to have a snack at all it's not in the sanctuary not in the sanctuary take the children out if you want to have a snack we're finding crumbs we're finding stuff this is not not the place for snacks it's not the place for drinks if you need a drink you're welcome to just go out if you want to bring a water bottle in that's I'm going to say this that's fine I'm not going to dispute it because some people are probably saying well what about you brother Barry hey what's good for the goose is good for the gander yeah if you want to bring a bottle of water in that's okay as parents it's your responsibility to manage your children that's right if the children want to start dumping their water bottle out if they want to put it in the pocket in the front of the seat upside down down and it starts to drip water out that's not the child's fault we need to make sure that we're watching over our kids if we're going to have a snack it's downstairs but you know when we do that the parents need to be managing their children not having children run around I'm not interested in trying to tell us how to parent what I am saying is reverence the house of God please amen please amen we found crumbs all over the place Bits of food come on would we beave that way in our living rooms I don't know maybe we would some people might but that's not how we do it here and that's why I'm saying it in case we want to have the benefit of the doubt for everyone we want to make sure everyone feels comfortable but please brothers and sisters don't just throw it all on the cleaners and say it's their problem whatever my kid made a mess and other kids are stepping in it and let's have respect if if if children need to have a snack please just take them downstairs set them down make them have a snack sitting down and then if there's a mess whose responsibility is that to clean is it the kids is it the cleaners no it's the parents that's why I say it behooves us as parents to make sure that when they're snacking they're snacking clean I don't know just simple things brothers and sisters but what can happen is this can cause problems and people can become upset and frustrated and maybe start to think thoughts and the devil just loves to get in any detail that he can right that's why I don't want to just leave this as maybe just a a an expectation that well somewhere along the way someone has said it right we're going to say it clearly yes this is the house of the Living God let's reverence it we're being called a little higher clearly as we heard in the song service and I say Amen call me higher Lord let let me let me just encourage one another so that we can actually see the spirit of God go move in our midst that he's happy with our our lives and and what we do so just to be clear downstairs is an extension of the sanctuary downstairs was always intended this is why we bought the screens this is why we put the sound in way back with brother Ken by the way not just brother Barry here this was with brother Ken and and that Sanctuary goes downstairs the sanctuary is actually in the basement where those chairs are some people can't sit here because of their children for whatever various reasons we're not judging we provided that place so they could go there and still participate but when we have other things going on it becomes very difficult to engage in the service people can't hear what's being preached maybe they can can't see it because it's being blocked we need to make sure that we have the same reverence level down there brothers and sisters people want to be fed and you know I'll tell you for those people that don't know who haven't experienced it yet there's some people that have never been married but those married people especially those that are that are with children you understand exactly what I'm saying especially to sisters it's impossible to come to church with a squirmy kid and get fed for many years and you know a lot of times the brothers will just be like yeah it's her problem that's her calling in life she'll be saved in childbearing I'm going to sit in the church and I'm going to say Amen to the word and she's going to struggle with three kids all on her own how can she ever get fed if she's not given an opportunity brothers and sisters we need to make sure that we're doing that by giving space in the basement not allowing kids to run around by reverencing this house and recognizing that we have to train our children to sit down and listen this is church if they want to run around there's a park take them out let them run around clearly they they don't have the ability to hear the word of God so sometimes that's the way it is the prophet even said we'll get into it in the conduct order and Doctrine that if you can't have a child set still if you can't have a child behave in church then you oughtn't to bring them to church that's what the prophet said that's right so downstairs brothers and sisters is set up to be an extension of the sanctuary not a place to sit and socialize while the preaching is happening or while the singing is going on it's not a social club it's the place to be in service just like this Sanctuary so please make the Deacon's job easy they're going to be actually encouraging us about what I'm speaking about right now this needs to be said we need to know that this is not just a perceived expectation and we're hoping that everyone's getting it I hope it's loud and clear and I hope it's not too much but remember this is the house of the Living God the basement's an extension of the sanctuary if your kids are going to have snacks parent them if if if they can't be quiet you know we have the two separate rooms and we have agreed that this would work well you can take them into one or the other room the Sunday School room and please mind the Sunday School equipment for sister Shelly she would very much appreciate that if you have your kids in there I know they want to have their own Sunday school but it's for when sister Shell is there but you know those rooms they have solid corridors on them for those people that don't know what that means they're solid wood so they retain sound so you could actually go in there and actually close out sound if your child is screaming having a child screaming and hoping they're going to stop screaming while everyone is trying to listen to the word it's an impossible thing so just take that child maybe and go in one of those rooms and then everyone can continue to get fed I'm going to stop this is the house of God let's let's be called a little bit higher I think that the Lord wants to see us come a little higher and I if he's calling us where there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond amen and don't worry about water in the sanctuary out the exposition of the seven Church ages actually I'm just going to go back to the scripture here um verse 33 of verse 32 of St John chapter 8 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if I had a title for today that's what it would be and the truth shall make you free how many people are free here today we have that glorious Liberty of knowing the truth what an incredible blessing it is to know the truth for our day out of the exposition of the seven Church ages Philadelphia and church age brother bradam he says oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is not of myself because our righteousness is but filthy rags before him isn't it that's the word of God I'm glad that I am in Christ with all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yay imparted unto me blessed be God forever amen he has given those attributes to us we can't get them on our own but he's given them to us how does he give them to us get the Holy Ghost it's that simple when we get his spirit his mind comes into us and we start to live as a new creature we become a new creature in Christ Jesus he goes on to say here out of the Philadelphia and church age these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word I I'm stuck on this you might be saying we've heard this already but I'm stuck on it brothers and sisters it it does not mean true in just a sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization now I just want to go back to the scripture here brother Bram he talks about it as Revelation as you go a little further in this quote but let's go back to our scripture today out of John chapter 8 we know that Jesus we'll just start with verse 31 as we read this through here he says then said Jesus to those Jews which believe on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free speaking to the Jews here the one excuse me try not to cough in your ear is bad enough he speaking to the Jews here these were the church members these were the leoty for the day yes and here's their response when the word was made flesh and was dwelling among them and he was letting them know that if you know the truth me being the truth the word of God which stands before you then you'll be free amen but here their response then they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest though ye shall be made free they did not have a perfect realization right they had an understanding we could go and get an ancest an yeah ancestory search done and be able to look back and see where we came from who our roots are they didn't need that they knew exactly who they were and truly they were The Offspring of Abraham but the interesting thing is they never had faith in their heart to mix with the word when it was made flesh and stood in front of them and interestingly today it's the same thing with the Gentile Church those people that don't have faith in their heart to mix with the word when it comes across their path or faith as a seed maybe we could word it that way when the word made flesh comes across our path and we hear about it we might not have the ability to actually see that word come to life if we don't have that seed if we don't have that Faith but I think it's interesting here these were the church members they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we never in bondage to any any man we were never under a a false leadership we were never under an erroneous message of a message church but there was never anything wrong in our lives from our youth we were raised in the truth and we know there was one Jesus came along and met that word made flesh met him and said hey you know what you've done all that from your youth but take all you've got and give it to the poor and pick up your cross and follow me and remember he was sorrowful because he was really really rich he likely had his daddy's business brother Brenham talks about an investment that boy when the word crossed his path he was not willing to let go of all this former teaching all he wanted to do was hold on to that and that held him back here we have this I I just want to say today don't believe brothers and sisters because maybe we've been raised in the message means that we've got it all figured out God is calling us higher and I think it's beautiful that we would have that little bump at the beginning of the service because I believe that's what God is doing don't think for a second because we know the message of the hour we where where're brother Bram SE seed we're Christ's seed and we are able to come to birth under his message that that's it that's where we stop that's not where we stop that's where we start that's the start of our journey we just see that that door in heaven is open and it's up to us to go a little higher Hallelujah are we willing to is the question what are we willing to sacrifice are we willing to sacrifice all that we got all that we are all that we think sometimes we don't have to sacrifice anything we just have to say amen I believe amen amen but sometimes there's things in our lives that will hold us back and unless we're willing to let it go we're not going to go any higher and make no mistake about it God will not leave us in the dark he won't leave us hanging and US wandering I wonder if there's anything in my life that I should actually lay down that Christ doesn't like is there something in my life that's displeasing to the Lord ask him that sometime genuinely sincerely from your heart if you have never if you have you know exactly what I'm saying amen he'll show you goes on to say here it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with partial realization perfect realization and partial realization you can just leave it up there brother you don't have to take it down right away the part partial realization is we're Abraham's seed we know our lineage we're good we're we're rich we're we're increased with Goods we have need of nothing brother Barry what are you talking about I don't even understand what you're trying to say he's calling us higher there is a perfect realization of Truth and that is what will set us free I want to say this brothers and sisters if you're not free then you don't have the perfect realization that kind of Sears but I think you know what we all need it I need it I need it in my life I want to have that perfect realization in my life brother brother Ram goes on to say for example we recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven John 151 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for US 1 John 2:8 because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of a partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before antitype contrasted with type and substance with Shadow take ex the example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day if it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type and they had Jesus standing right before them those Jews had the word made flesh and it's so beautiful because he speaks in Parables doesn't he yes he does if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment that he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no longer a need for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God understanding that name of Jesus brothers and sisters is something we can never take for granted when we speak the name of Jesus under the revelation of the seventh Angel's messenger under the opening of the seventh seal when we speak the name of Jesus all Heavens in Earth will pass away but that name never will my and we know that there's only one name whereby we can be saved Hallelujah we know there's only one name that's going to cast out a devil we know there's only one name that brings salvation and deliverance to our lives I just think it's so beautiful when we look at this scripture here how indeed we could say very easily you know what I I I'm I'm Abraham's seed man i' I've been in the message I was never in bondage under any uncertain sound under any wrong Ministry I I had the pure word my whole entire life but do we have the Holy Ghost is the question brothers and sisters because this message isn't about understanding the message this message is about going on and getting into Christ getting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost John chapter 8 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples and isn't that wonderful if you continue in my word and not if you continue in my ways if you continue in whatever I think should happen my actions if you continue in my church if you continue in my word then you shall be my disciples and ye shall know the truth how will we ever know the truth brothers and sisters unless the spirit of truth comes into our lives how does the spirit of Truth come into our lives just because we receive the message just because we're born into a message Church a message home no because we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's the spirit of Truth truth amen when the spirit he the spirit of truth comes into our life we become a new creature we get a new mind inside of us and it controls our bodies Hallelujah the things that we once desired we no longer desire I think this 832 out of St John in the Amplified Bible I'll say it out of the King James and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free in the Amplified Bible it says it the way that I had always thought it and I know that I studied the King James Bible I've read the King James Bible but many times we say it this way that the truth shall not make us free that it shall set us free it's an interesting comparison and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free it's not going to set us free brothers and sisters we're not in bondage Sons and Daughters of God are not in bondage they always were Sons and Daughters of God Amen we don't need to be set free we need to be made free amen it's no accident that the word is written that way either you know talking about Revelation the exposition of the seven Church ages the importance of Revelation to a True Believer I just can't get enough of this either brothers and sisters it's very important for us to remember it you know we could be in the message of the hour for 50 years for 60 years for 75 years and make no mistake about it there's still further revelation because we're talking about God that's right he's going to reveal himself to us throughout the Millennium throughout eternity he's going to reveal himself continually to us in these mere mortal Minds 70 years 80 years maybe of serving God under the guise of the message of the hour some people could say I I don't need any more Revelation I've got salvation sure but that's exactly where you'll stop there's more and it's not more message it's more Christ brothers and sisters hallelujah it's more Christ amen the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer it's not just Revelation it's Revelation by the spirit it can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all revelation it's tremendously important to the church do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question who do men say I excuse me the son of man am I'm sorry if I sound like a stuck record preaching something that maybe I I've preached before but I I just I can't get past it if the Lord leads me back to it I I I just have to go forwards and and preach what he says to do and I I just hope that whatever the Lord is trying to accomplish by this this becomes accomplished I think he's calling someone if not everyone a little higher and like I say that with this he says in there that it can never be overemphasized so we can say it a lot I hope that's okay but you know brothers and sisters where I want to get down to is the nitty-gritty you know when in verse 33 of John chapter 8 they answered him we be of Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest though ye shall be made free who are you to tell us that this could actually happen we already know who we are we know our lineage we know that we're saved according to the Old Testament law you know what we have we have a case of knowledge slash information we can have a lot of head knowledge and a lot of information we can even have a lot of experience in terms of tenure but we read that scripture a little while ago tenure doesn't mean anything sometimes tenure can actually be a little bit of a disruption in terms of our walk with the Lord yes it can because that tenure can make us believe that we're actually in a position that we're actually not knowledge SL information is one thing that is what will lead to Revelation if we're willing to follow the information and the knowledge that we're given but it takes Revelation by the spirit not just revelation we can have revelation we can have a surprise and say wow I never realized that and and and experience Revelation but Revelation by the spirit brothers and sisters is the next level Revelation by the spirit is what will cause us to become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen is it very warm in here this morning it feels warm it feels warm I wondered maybe we should open a window or something it's Revelation by the spirit brothers and sisters that's going to actually change our bodies it's not understanding that's going to do it it's not information that's going to do it but it's through the spoken word that we gain information hallelujah it's through the spoken word that we can gain knowledge from that understanding it has to become though more than knowledge to us in order for it to become Revelation Revelation to the individual is more than just learning knowledge and understanding Revelation to the individual ual is what brother bradam said is the new birth Christ revealing himself personally to the individual amen but you know what I want to get to is what what's our attitude do we line up with what verse 33 says or do we actually have a different attitude towards the word in our day are we willing to say teach me Lord lead me take me higher I want to go further you know knowing the word is one thing but actually living it is a totally separate thing Revelation to the individual I I'll say it this way it becomes an intimate understanding of it it it takes it to the next level where brother brandham talks about being able to read between the lines when his wife writes him a letter he can see what she's trying to say to him he can read the words that's one thing but he can also understand what the point is she's trying to get across to him and sometimes I wonder if we're able to get the point of what the word is trying to get across to us are we actually catching the drift about what the message of the hour is calling us to do today amen we're being called to get ready for a Rapture he's calling a church out of a church this is not a time to get complacent or a time to get tired for those people that hike or run or do anything endurance wise you know what that means you can get halfway up the mountain and think you've come so far but you're going to the top man you're not going halfway you still have more to go sometimes we just need to take a little rest just relax a little bit allow the the the oxygen to catch up in our bodies maybe let the blood flow maybe have a little snack that's why we come to the house of the Lord we're we're actually in an endurance run it's not just a Sprint we're going all the way brothers and sisters to the top of the mountain it's got to be more than knowledge it has to be a revelation to us it has to become an intimate understanding being able to read between the lines where we no longer just see it as text but we see it as a love letter about us where we can put our names there and say he's talking about me today we're supposed to go to our brother and our sister I got into this a little bit in Edmonton I think it's so good just a a for free this is a for free today supposed to go to our brother and sister if there's an issue not give place to the devil right the word says go to him not send him a text doesn't say send him an email doesn't say phone him says go to him takes a lot of courage to do that when there's a bee in our Bonnet but you know when we have the right spirit in our lives he the spirit of truth will give us the courage to do it in love right information and knowledge has to become a revelation to the individual and when it becomes a revelation to the individual what happens is it becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus amen when it's Revelation by the Spirit about the word I just think it's so beautiful when we can look at this brothers and sisters you know we we're not here to have a code of conduct we're not here to to to mess around we're here to get people to Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever and like we said at the beginning of the service you know he's not coming it's not like he was here he's hereall how many people are gathered in the name of Jesus Christ right now show of hands he's here hallah his word says where two or three are gathered in my name I'm there so what's our need brothers and sisters what do we have as a desire in our hearts do we think that he is not the same yesterday today and forever or that he is the same yesterday today and forever because he is more than able to deliver us or or help us or or bring us or get us whatever it is we need amen even right now Hallelujah I just think it's so beautiful when we get that that that intimate that knowledge moves from the intimacy it moves from the understanding the the head knowledge goes down it travels down and goes right down into our heart it becomes more than just a a head knowledge and an understanding about this word about the message of the hour about even Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever but what it does is it shows that truly no matter what my faults and failures are I can be the Bride of Jesus Christ not because I chose it because his word chose it and what's weird is every time I read about the bride something jumps inside of me amen amen something happens when I hear that word bride I was thinking about it yesterday you just as a Believer you just can't look at a wedding ceremony the same once you get saved you just can't when you see a bride and a groom even worldly people when they're willing to go and get married at an altar there's something special about that and that's because it was first instituted before the foundation of the world not even in the Garden of Eden brothers and sisters he took a lamb of a bride of his own choosing before the foundation of the world that's what the word says but you know when we truly get to that place where we become the Bride of Jesus Christ where it goes from a a partial understanding or realization to the perfect realiz when I hear that and when I see that something happens inside of me there's a life that jumps inside of me we don't have to tell people right I don't have to tell people I'm a Christian people will start apologizing for swearing when they're talking around me yes and they'll say I'm sorry I don't even know why I I SAR we won't have to tell people I'm a Christian I believe the message I'm a message believer believer we're like the king and priest the high priest that walks that has on the bottom of His Garment a a pomegranate and a bell made of gold and a pomegranate and a bell made of gold and a pomegranate and a bell made of gold could you imagine wearing a robe like that where you walk and every time you walk your legs on the front Jingles the bells and the back Jingles the bells jingle jingle jingle jingle we know that the word says that his walk is supposed to say supposed to declare holy holy holy art thou Lord God Almighty and that's no different for the Bride of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters think about that when we live in this world when we're at the grocery store when we're driving in our cars when we're with our family at home is our life echoing that sound of holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty because when that begins to happen then this word has moved from head knowledge to an intimate relationship inside of our heart where we become a new creature we can say we're a new creature in Christ because we believe the message all we want but the actions in our lives will show the world exactly who we are the people around us will tell us wow there's something different about you I I I I think it's wonderful when when they do when they can recognize it and and you know we look at it and think wow I didn't even realize that maybe it wasn't so uh so visible to me it's like children when they grow children love it when they get around grandparents or aunts or uncles or people they'd never seen for a long time they say wow you've grown so much look at you how much you've grown up last time I saw you you were This Tall etc etc and the child's like you know H not getting embarrassed and not sure how to take it but you know brothers and sisters they can't see it because it happen so gradually in their lives it's the same thing for the Believers if we just keep pressing on like the prophet said the people that were beyond the curtain of time they just kept saying to him keep pressing on keep preaching what Paul preached because that's where we stand that's where we believe we're resting on that I think it's so beautiful we can look at this from a legalistic perspective and I'm not preaching it from that I'll never do that I think the word is uh maybe for some people they could have the perception that the word is a little bit legalistic but you know when you actually do get the spirit of Christ in you it becomes a a a love of the word and it's not laborious Jesus told the people you know what my my my burden is light my my yoke is e easy you you just if you come and and try and live with me try and walk with me and see what happens my yoke is easy and my burden is light see if I won't try and help you carry the load I I think it's wonderful to look at this and you know he said to them he said to these people the the religious people if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free first you've got to continue in his word many people don't want to continue in his word today we know this I'm preaching to the choir here about cutting hair and wearing pants and and we could say all of that about the homosexuality and and the lgbtq and all the rights all of that we know all of that that that's not where we need to go we know that the letter kth if we were to get legalistic and and punch a a a pile of notes on the wall and say this is what we believe put it on our website this is what we believe you know people probably would get grossed out because they would say it's a bunch of legalists that's not what we do we preach Christ crucified just like Paul preached and when that happens we want to line up with the word amen and how do we do that we follow the word of the Vindicated prophet he sent a prophet in this age to call us back to Center and those people that were called before the foundation of the world would be able to hear that but you know the scripture says it that the letter killing but the spirit giveth life if we think we're going to live a legalistic life and have the spirit of Christ in us and still turn around and do a a Shifty deal or something just maybe you know we were talking about this a little while ago I think it's interesting how folks will like to skirt the the laws of the land and think that they're pleasing God you're not pleasing God when you actually bend the rules and you manipulate and you swim into the gray areas you know God can't bless us the way that he wants to bless us when we're willing to do that well I just don't declare all those on my taxes or I I just manipulate this in such a way to make it look like that and you know it's okay it's not okay in the sight of God he sees it and there's a blessing that you're actually removing from your life because of it and usually where it comes from from is a legalistic perspective I'm going to understand the laws of the land and I'm going to try and stretch them and bend them as far as I can to manipulate it to benefit me I say give it all to God and see if he won't bless us he took the coin that day and told his disciples whose inscription is on this coin who do you see there he said Caesars they said Caesars and he said Render unto Caesar what's Caesars but give God what's God's amen amen you know when we uh when we live the life according to the word for our day when when the letter we know kth and the spirit that's living inside of us is giving us life it causes people to be attracted to us and it's interesting because on on the other side of the coin it also repels people but it's beautiful because in John 6:37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I in no wise cast out it's such a beautiful thing to know that you know we have that place of rest all that the father has given Jesus will come to him isn't that beautiful we can sing that song in the name of Jesus we have the Victory and we truly do don't we Jesus Jesus there's just something about I want to say it this way I don't know maybe someone would get upset by it but if you would sing that song change it from the name to your name there's something about your name make it first person brothers and sisters it's just such a wonderful song to think about though when we sing there's something about his name that name is above every name my you know looking at our scripture today go on back to the scripture the truth shall make you free there I just looked at two words and uh one of them is make it's g659 it's l Uther oo I don't know if I word that right but it's g659 anyways if uh if anyone's interested and it says to liberate figuratively to exempt from moral ceremonial or Mortal liability to deliver make free I just think that's such a beautiful thought to know that there is a Liberation because we know this where the spirit of the Lord is there is and sometimes we can look at that and we can interpret it and say yes I've got Liberty I can clap and I can move and maybe I can raise my hands maybe I can jump up and down maybe I just have to run maybe I just have to scream maybe I just have to weep maybe I just have to quietly stand still and not do anything whatever it is there's liberty to do that but brother and sisters it goes farther than that we can have the liberty of his spirit in US knowing that every single situation that we encounter in our lives he is in control ofallah I think it's beautiful to look at this word make free the truth shall make you free and and and if you take a look at the word free I was surprised I had to go back I scratched my head and and looked twice and thought am I crazy maybe I was just up too early maybe something's wrong I don't know what's going on here but if you look at the word free it's g659 l u the oo the word free is the same as make to liberate figuratively to exempt from moral ceremonial or Mortal liability to deliver to make free isn't that exactly what Jesus was doing when he stood before those church members and told them if you abide in me and my word abides in you just ask what you want now I know he didn't say that here in John chapter 8 so I apologize I just got inspired but he told them if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed here he was just giving them a little bit of milk he was just telling them you know just enough to get them interested to cause them to come a little bit higher and and I think it's so beautiful and when you do that when you know that you're his disciple when you're following him then that truth that you're following will make you to be free you will have that Liberty in your life I think it's such a beautiful thing my you know uh brother Bram he talks about how incredible it is how incredible it is that the disciples they knew Jesus they knew him by relationship but Paul he never met Jesus by relationship he never met Jesus by Fellowship as a person did he the disciples they knew Jesus and they wrote about him Paul he actually met Jesus in the pillar of fire this is something that I want to preach on in a little while I think it's so incredibly beautiful isn't it wonderful to think how some can come to know Jesus by the letter by seeing him in person they can come to know him by his voice by his physical characteristics they they can even go to the place where maybe they see signs and wonders in their lives but I believe brothers and sisters it's next level when it becomes like Paul where we can actually know him by Revelation when we know him by revelation we can actually move into that Apostolic State it's such a beautiful thing to know the letter kth the Old Testament letter kth but the spirit of Jesus Christ gives life I just wanted to turn over to Luke chapter 4 this morning if you don't mind turning there with me Luke chap 4 verse 18 my in the last few minutes Luke chapter 4 verse 18 Jesus speaking here the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised amen isn't that wonderful to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears if you're wondering about this there's a tremendous message in 1965 we all probably are well familiar with it this day this scripture is fulfilled he preaches it a couple of times it's a tremendous tremendous message and you know brother Bram he takes it and he begins to talk about all of this and he says there's a reason why he closed the book at that place if if you'll just turn over to Isaiah chapter 61 Jesus wasn't bringing a new scripture when he was there in the flesh that's right amen all he did was point back to the word and that's all a true leader will do is point back to the word that's what we've been reading about on Wednesday nights brother brandham inspired by the Holy Ghost a true leader will not bind people to to himself a true leader will not say that people need to pay homage to me a true leader will Point people to Jesus Christ amen Isaiah 61 verse one the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound Amen to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and remember that's where he closed the book and sat down and he said all of that that I've said already has been fulfilled in your eyesall everything that the prophet said should happen when I come has already happened but he didn't finish this verse brother brandom says it the second half of this verse and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn we know that day is coming it's coming very very soon and that's why we're here today brothers and sisters to recognize our position there is coming a day where this this world will no longer be our home and I think it's so beautiful because brother Bram he says it it's going to be just like we're walking stepping off a curb we're not doing something special sometimes we have services and it feels like we're going to Rapture it feels like those dimensions are blending and that's because they are I can't help but think we have all those that have gone on before us are leaning over the banisters of Heaven saying keep pressing on Amen listen to them worship they haven't even seen what we're experiencing but yet they're still praising keep praising don't give in brothers and sisters the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that MN that day is coming it's never been closer this is no time to get weary no time to to need to just take a step backwards this is time to press on to press forwards to press on to the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus not the word not just this this church not just something that we do on our own but to know exactly it is Christ Jesus amen hallelujah I just think this is such a beautiful topic here that's right and we have to close soon my out of the unveiling of God uh you know I'm probably not going to I'm sorry if you if you uh if you listen to the unveiling of God brother Bram he preaches from 19 uh Philippians 19 chapter 2 um actually it's it's Chapter 19 Verse two and then he preaches out of 2 Corinthians the third chapter beginning with the sixth verse and uh I'm just going to say this just for the sake of time he says who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious talking about the ten commandments so that the children of Israel could not steadfast behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious amen I can say it is we can all witness that it is for the if the ministration of condemnation be glorious much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious has no glory in this Respect by reasons of the glory that excelth for if that which is done away was Glory how much more hath which remaineth is Glory seeing then we have this have such a hope we must greatly plainness of speech use great plainness of speech and and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished but if their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts nevertheless when it shall be turned to the Lord the veil shall be taken away and any day now brothers and sisters that Veil is going to be taken away there's going to be two witnesses two prophets in the land of Israel preaching this word taking that Veil away amen now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord has changed into the same image from Glory unto Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not we were talking about that before service the more Mercy the more grace we receive it it just causes us to become more and more faint it causes us to to to just be more and more humbled to recognize there's nothing that we've ever done but have renounced the hidden things and the dishonest not walking in craftiness and handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth condemning ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them which are lost I think it's so beautiful such a tremendous thing you know brothers and sisters when when Jesus was here on Earth he actually said to them right after this in in John chapter 8 you know we began to talk about the bread from heaven and he told them that unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no no no part in me and they said you know he's a vampire he's a bad guy he's going against the law of Moses how could he ever do this but they didn't recognize that the the law was turning a corner the word of God was actually changing a dispensation was making a turn amen people said brother Bram said that Jes Jesus would do that God would just do that he didn't even explain to the people he didn't say to them this is why I'm saying it because I know not everyone can actually walk all the way with me not everyone is actually going to be truly a son or a daughter in fact some are actually Devils but he didn't say it brother bam said he didn't even explain it at all he just told them unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you got no life in you what how could you say such a thing that's terrible to say but he did it that way for a purpose if you hear what brother bradam says out of out of the unveiling of God he says now my subject this morning I trust God will reveal this and I trust that God will reveal it too it's got to be God that reveals it brothers and sisters it can't be brother Barry it can't be our parents it can't be our Sunday school teachers it's got to be God that reveals this and each time if you take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what God has been trying to get over to the church without saying saying it outright see it's a thing he doesn't come right out and say it he says sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down that it might bring some to go out some to leave and some to ponder over but it's done purposely it must be done that way then it might be that some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he said he certainly did he does yes that's why I love it brothers and sisters I love it I'll never stop harping on the Holy Ghost I'll never stop preaching Christ crucified died and rose again on the third day for the purpose of actually giving us the Holy Ghost sending us the comforter so that we have the earnest of our Salvation so that we can see that God is real he is tangible I can see him in my life if you haven't been able to experience him that way then I pray that you'll be able to and if you have been able to experience that way then I trust you can say Amen to that because that's the only thing we need is the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead us and guide us into all truth I'll call the musicians I have one more quote that I want to read though I think it's so important I can't let it go brothers and sisters Glory it's so beautiful it's out of this message and uh it's so good you know brother bradam he says and and I mean this is at the end of it end of the message the unveiling of God and and he says it that we identify with the spirit of the country that we're from and he's talking about being American if you're an American then you identify with the American Spirit and you know being Canadian we identify with the Canadian Spirit whether we like it or not that is the way it is that doesn't mean that we identify with Prime Minister Trudeau's Spirit or that we identify with President Trump's spirit it's the American Spirit or the Canadian Spirit or the German or French whatever the country is but brother Bram says and as a Christian I'm identified with him yes he talks about identifying as an American and and identifying with George Washington when he crossed the Delaware and bare feet he talks about identifying with all of the great situations that happened in the US us because as a US citizen you have to just like in Canada we have to identify with all the Canadian history and brother bradam he changes it now and he goes into being a Christian identifying as a Christian maybe stand with me today I think it's so beautiful when you look at the identification because here we live in a world where everyone's trying to identify everyone says what's your identity how do you identify I love that question because I identify as I am I am brother Bram says and as a Christian I'm identified with him amen I was with Noah when he went into the ark I was with Moses when he come out of Egypt amen I Was Elijah on Mount Carmel isn't it beautiful he says I Was Elijah on Mount Carmel yes sir glory to God I was with him when he did that I was truly with him I identified myself in his death there on Cal and this is so beautiful brothers and sisters when I died to the things of the world Amen to myself to all Traditions amen I was identified with him I was identified with him on Easter morning when he rose from the dead I was identified with him on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down like a rushing Mighty Wind I'm sure we can all say amen amen I was identified with him all that he was I am amen all that I am he was amen being dead in him we are identified with him amen what he is I am glory to God I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when we read stuff like this he's not coming right out and telling us everything he's thinning it out I can't help but think brothers and sisters what does the second coming of Christ actually look like what does it look like what's it going to look like when we go and meet with him in the air I personally believe with all my heart it does not look any different than it does right now today on a cold miserable February day the brothers and sisters we look around and maybe some of us maybe feel a little better than others maybe some of us look a little better than others maybe some have good breath maybe some have bad breath you know brothers and sisters we're all Sinners saved by grace does not matter how much money we've got it doesn't matter how smart we are have you surrendered your life to Christ have you gotten all the way into Christ Jesus that's what matters that is the Crux of the message for today and not just today with brother Barry for this age in which we live because without Christ we're lost as lost can be brother bradam says without the Holy Ghost you're lost as lost can be I think it's so beautiful we have the opportunity to be identified with him because he says it right here what he is making it present tense what he is I am Godly bless you each one today as we close let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just are so thankful that you've given us this word in the day in which we live Lord to recognize that we don't need to be slapped around by the devil lord he's coming around on every front on every hand Lord everywhere we look we can see him but father we're so thankful that we can look away to Jesus we're so thankful that we can look away to you Lord and recognize the only reason he's coming after us is because he knows his time is so short that that day where we get taken up and he is cast down is just around the corner just like spring is coming so soon oh Father we know this Rapture this resurrection and Rapture is on the horizon father Lord we just pray that we would be ready for it Lord I say help me Lord Jesus be ready for it help us Lord Jesus to reverence you help us to consecrate Our Lives fresh unto you help us Lord to just do more father to follow your word to follow your voice that still Small Voice in our hearts Lord Jesus father we know that it will never steer us clear of your word so father we pray that we would just be able to hear your voice Lord that we would be able to push aside our Traditions father that we would die with you on Calvary as we read that we would ident identify with that Lord that we would identify that you Rose again father that Lord you wouldn't just Rise Again 2,000 years ago but you rise again inside of us Lord Jesus that there is a resurrection and the Rapture is already happening because I can see a resurrection of your life inside of me Lord oh Father and we know there will come a day very soon where we will meet you in the clouds what will it be like to see you face to face Lord oh help us Lord Jesus not to get weary help us Lord Jesus to press on oh Father how we love you and we thank you we pray that you would be with those who are away father who are traveling father brother John panicker sister Rosie father brother Paul sister Elaine father anyone else Lord if we've forgotten them just bless them doubly father we pray and bring them all home safely at the appointed time we ask Lord now that you would give us traveling mercies as we go into this bitter cold father that our cars would be safe Lord that there would be no no accidents father and if it Be Your Will for us to
