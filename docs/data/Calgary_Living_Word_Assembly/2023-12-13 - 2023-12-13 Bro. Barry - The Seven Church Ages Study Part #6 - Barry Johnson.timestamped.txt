[48:31] Friday he'll take the service Saturday
[48:33] night at 6 o' Sunday morning at 10:00
[48:37] a.m. we have a Youth Event coming up on
[48:40] the on the Sunday after the service and
[48:43] uh I do believe there's opportunity for
[48:46] those who need rides to arrange for them
[48:49] if you need a ride uh please reach out
[48:51] and I'm sure that can be arranged and
[48:54] then we will have the blessing of
[48:56] brother Emanuel taking the service for
[48:58] us on the 27th I do believe that's still
[49:01] on the horizon is that right brother
[49:04] amen so we uh we're certainly excited to
[49:07] see what the lord has laid upon his
[49:09] heart amen it's been a while and uh you
[49:13] know it's exciting when you hear um the
[49:16] report about how the Sunday school has
[49:19] been talking about what we actually talk
[49:21] about in the service up here and
[49:23] sometimes it's the entire uh subject of
[49:26] the service and sometimes it's just
[49:27] brushing over it but rest assured that
[49:30] brother Emanuel and I don't uh compare
[49:33] notes um before Sunday school and before
[49:36] service and maybe we should I I don't
[49:38] know but maybe we shouldn't because we
[49:42] can look at it and say it's a
[49:43] supernatural element it's truly the Lord
[49:46] you know I had a brother say to me on
[49:48] Sunday that you know that exact quote
[49:50] you read about the the sour and the
[49:52] Sweet Apple is a quote that I read just
[49:56] today and you know that's the Lord
[49:58] there's no way that that happens just by
[50:00] accident some might say it's coincidence
[50:03] the devil would say it's just
[50:04] coincidence the world would say it's
[50:05] coincidence but you know the spirit and
[50:07] the bride they say the same
[50:10] thing so anyways we uh we're looking
[50:13] forward to seeing what the Lord has in
[50:14] store it'll be a good weekend this
[50:15] weekend and uh it's always a wonderful
[50:18] time of fellowship with brother Cadre
[50:20] he's been a real encouragement and
[50:22] friend to me and I'm just excited to see
[50:25] him again yes um it looks like it's
[50:29] going to be an interesting year for uh
[50:32] Ministry the the the brothers are
[50:34] reaching out and is wanting to travel so
[50:37] we we might have another couple of
[50:39] Brothers coming this uh this summer and
[50:42] it could be real interesting we
[50:44] definitely have brother Andrew Glover
[50:46] confirmed and uh I'm not sure what the
[50:49] date is but we can certainly confirm
[50:50] that if anybody has a question by all
[50:53] means just let me know I I apologize
[50:55] olze because tonight I have a bit of a
[51:00] cough and I'm likely going to be doing
[51:02] that quite a bit so if you'll bear with
[51:05] me I'll try and not cough in your ear
[51:08] but for those people who uh have the
[51:10] revelation of Jesus Christ with them
[51:13] tonight in the exposition of the seven
[51:14] Church ages uh for those people who
[51:17] don't we're just going to continue on
[51:19] reading last time we left off with uh I
[51:22] believe it's paragraph 50 in the
[51:24] exposition of the seven Church ages out
[51:26] of the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[51:30] you know the the
[51:31] discussion is such that there's one God
[51:36] and I just love the way that the prophet
[51:38] brings it out in here now that I
[51:41] mentioned it I'm going to cough like
[51:43] crazy it's oh my
[51:46] goodness maybe it's a bad
[51:48] confession rebuke that devil in the name
[51:50] of Jesus Amen we'll just get into this
[51:53] word here yes
[51:57] last time we talked about it how um
[52:01] there's no baptism in the Bible in the
[52:03] name of the father and the Son and the
[52:04] Holy Ghost that's not Christian baptism
[52:07] right and we know that that changed
[52:09] after uh after the Catholic Church got
[52:12] in and uh there's nowhere documented in
[52:16] the Bible where they baptized in the
[52:17] name of the father Son and the Holy
[52:18] Ghost the Great Commission was to go and
[52:20] baptize in the name of the Father the
[52:22] Son and the Holy Ghost we'll get into it
[52:23] tonight brother bradam talks about it
[52:25] how the disciples that were with Jesus
[52:27] they knew jesus' name isn't that
[52:30] wonderful to know jesus' name I thought
[52:33] boy could just take a whole sermon and
[52:35] talk about how incredible it is just to
[52:37] know jesus' name kind of like we talked
[52:39] about tonight you know when the spirit
[52:41] speaks to the the age that age has an
[52:44] ear there's a group of people that have
[52:45] an ear to hear what the spirit says not
[52:48] everyone has the ability to hear what
[52:49] the spirit says and it's uh it's a
[52:52] beautiful thing because it it it
[52:54] demonstrates that there's different
[52:55] different classes of people and it's
[52:57] according to election according to for
[52:58] knowledge it it's not something that we
[53:00] could even choose to do if we wanted to
[53:03] last time we spoke about the godhead and
[53:05] this uh probably the last time this time
[53:08] and maybe even the next time will be
[53:10] basically uh talking about the godhead
[53:13] and I think it's just a beautiful
[53:15] discussion because uh many times people
[53:18] make it so incredibly difficult and so
[53:21] incredibly convoluted and confusing you
[53:24] know the godhead is Christ in you the
[53:27] hope of glory that truly is the godhead
[53:30] when that settles when that can actually
[53:33] become I would say the fundamental
[53:35] Foundation of your faith then you have
[53:37] the opportunity to begin to understand
[53:40] what the godhead truly is that it's just
[53:42] one God he's manifesting in three
[53:44] different
[53:45] manifestations I mean we could have a a
[53:48] a a public office in the City of Calgary
[53:51] I could go and potentially get a bunch
[53:53] of people to vote for me maybe they
[53:54] wouldn't but if I did just for the sake
[53:56] of example I wanted to be the the mayor
[53:59] of the City of Calgary I could become
[54:01] the mayor of the City of Calgary but I
[54:03] couldn't sign a check in the name mayor
[54:06] City of Calgary it would get returned at
[54:09] the bank how could you baptize in the
[54:12] name of the father or the son or the
[54:15] Holy Ghost it just doesn't make sense
[54:17] once you see it it just doesn't make
[54:18] sense it's like walking into a room we
[54:21] used to do the renovations and paint
[54:23] touchups and when you have a spot on the
[54:25] wall you might not see it ever you could
[54:27] walk in and out of that room your whole
[54:29] entire life but when somebody walks in
[54:31] for the first time and they say Do you
[54:32] ever see that spot on the wall there
[54:34] well now it's ruined because you're
[54:35] going to see it every time you walk in
[54:37] that room you're going to look at that
[54:38] it's kind of like that with the word of
[54:40] God you come to that place where you
[54:42] actually get the ability to see it and
[54:43] once you see it you can't unsee
[54:46] it but it's a revelation it's a gift
[54:48] from God Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal
[54:50] that to people right it's so beautiful
[54:53] but even Paul you know being being a
[54:56] scholar he didn't have the opportunity
[54:59] to have another experience did he I was
[55:02] just considering this since the last
[55:04] time we
[55:07] talked
[55:09] how interesting it is Jesus Christ is
[55:12] same yesterday today and
[55:13] forever how
[55:15] Paul persecuted the church laid it to
[55:18] waste those were his
[55:19] words but what happened when he was on
[55:22] his road to Damascus and and we all know
[55:24] it so obvious and and I I apologize if
[55:28] it's tough on a Wednesday night maybe
[55:30] we'll try and shake out of the out of
[55:32] the first gear that I feel like I'm in
[55:34] right now um but Paul he met the pillar
[55:38] of fire for himself he didn't meet a
[55:41] scholar on the road no no someone didn't
[55:44] try and persuade him someone didn't try
[55:46] and talk him into this new gospel of
[55:48] Jesus Christ Christ came to him
[55:52] personally exactly the way that he had
[55:55] had learned about his whole entire
[55:57] life and that's why he comes the same
[56:00] yesterday today and forever but I just
[56:02] thought it was wonderful because it
[56:03] wasn't a different type of experience it
[56:05] was through the pillar of fire and Paul
[56:06] was very familiar with that the pillar
[56:08] of fire experience he knew that was God
[56:11] that's how Jehovah dealt with the
[56:12] fathers while they were in the
[56:15] wilderness but he met that Pillar of
[56:17] Fire for himself and it was exactly
[56:20] according to the Old Testament
[56:21] scriptures and he knew that but even
[56:23] once he realized that once Paul got that
[56:25] Revelation for himself that this is
[56:28] sounding familiar to what I've been
[56:30] taught he didn't just rely upon that
[56:32] experience to be knocked down off his
[56:34] horse to be blind to go into the city to
[56:36] have someone named annias pray for you
[56:38] tell him to pray for you and you'll
[56:40] actually have your vision restored and
[56:43] then have this man have the same thing
[56:45] told to him and both of them coming
[56:47] together he he didn't rely on that he
[56:49] didn't say praise God I've got this
[56:51] Revelation now of the word for my day
[56:53] and I'm just going to go forwards and be
[56:54] be the the prophet to the age being a
[56:57] scholar being a a Pharisee of Pharisees
[57:00] what did he do he said I count all that
[57:02] I thought I knew was dung and I got to
[57:05] go out into Arabia now for three years
[57:09] and I've got to seek this out for myself
[57:11] because I can't rely on an experience to
[57:13] say whether I've got the word of God or
[57:15] not whether it was truly God that's met
[57:18] me and that's why brothers and sisters I
[57:20] feel so I guess emphatic about this we
[57:23] got to be very careful to not say
[57:24] because we've had a great experience of
[57:26] Supernatural miracles happen in our
[57:28] midst that's God sure it is but are you
[57:32] able to live the
[57:33] word because that's where the rubber
[57:35] meets the road if we can't live the word
[57:38] then something's wrong we're no
[57:39] different than any denomination out
[57:41] there in the world right but Paul got
[57:43] this Revelation and he had to go on the
[57:45] back side of the desert and we know
[57:47] brother brandham says it that no
[57:48] Minister should be ministering until
[57:50] they've had a backside of the desert
[57:52] experience and that is a complete change
[57:54] change of thinking that's a complete
[57:56] change of tradition that's a complete
[57:58] change of everything that we thought we
[58:00] knew when when our parents behaved a
[58:02] certain way that's good for them because
[58:04] that's them but what about me my
[58:06] experience for with God is what counts
[58:08] today that's what God's going to look
[58:10] for he's not going to say why you've got
[58:11] the exact same experience as your daddy
[58:14] as your mommy God's not going to do that
[58:16] he's going to say you got to have your
[58:18] own experience I need to know you
[58:21] personally for myself you need to know
[58:24] me personally
[58:25] but then Paul goes back to Jerusalem
[58:27] after his three years in the desert and
[58:29] what does he do he meets
[58:31] Peter and suddenly they're speaking the
[58:33] same language they're preaching the same
[58:35] gospel but they've never met before how
[58:38] are they doing that it's Revelation by
[58:40] the spirit it's proving that it's the
[58:42] word of God and that he has worked on
[58:44] both ends and now these men have the
[58:47] word for their day you know in Galatians
[58:50] 1:15 it says but when it pleased God who
[58:53] separated me from my mother's womb and
[58:55] called me by his
[58:57] grace my
[59:00] goodness excuse me to reveal his son in
[59:04] me that I might preach him among the
[59:06] Heathen immediately I conferred not with
[59:09] flesh and blood now I just want to point
[59:12] out that word heathen it doesn't mean
[59:13] complete rank unbelievers it means
[59:16] non-jews that's what that word means so
[59:19] we're not talking about people who are
[59:20] ranked Sinners here we're talking about
[59:22] people who aren't Jews so the Gentiles
[59:24] and immediately I conferred not with
[59:25] flesh and blood I didn't just rely on my
[59:27] own senses like we talked about on
[59:29] Sunday the senses will lie to us brother
[59:31] bradam said Paul said immediately I
[59:33] conferred not with flesh and blood
[59:35] neither went I up to Jerusalem to them
[59:37] which were the apostles before me but I
[59:39] went into Arabia and returned again unto
[59:43] Damascus he went back to where this
[59:45] experience happened he went back to
[59:47] investigate it you know in the in the
[59:50] Hebrew series brother bradam talks about
[59:51] this real good he goes really good and
[59:54] deep into this this and talks about it
[59:56] and how important it is for us to have
[59:57] our own experience and our own
[59:59] experience needs to be based on the word
[1:00:02] it can't just be a supernatural
[1:00:04] happening in our life because the devil
[1:00:06] can impersonate any gift of God except
[1:00:09] for the word except for the ability to
[1:00:11] believe the word that's why that's the
[1:00:12] only true evidence of having the Holy
[1:00:14] Ghost In Our Lives is the ability to
[1:00:16] accept the word to receive the word for
[1:00:18] our Day verse 18 says then after three
[1:00:20] years I went up to Jerusalem to see
[1:00:22] Peter and Abode with him 15 days
[1:00:26] this was Jesus Christ God manifest in
[1:00:29] the human body the same yesterday today
[1:00:32] and forever we had have to see the same
[1:00:35] thing in our lives brothers and
[1:00:37] sisters taking a look at this now based
[1:00:41] on all of
[1:00:42] that we know that we can't rely on on
[1:00:46] these experiences Supernatural
[1:00:49] experiences to say that we've got the
[1:00:50] word although they follow the word of
[1:00:53] God the super natural stuff will follow
[1:00:56] but seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:00:59] Amen I think it's just a an amazing
[1:01:01] study here that we're going through and
[1:01:03] it just gets me excited when I I I read
[1:01:05] a paragraph and it's like a kid in the
[1:01:07] candy shop and I just can't help myself
[1:01:09] and I apologize because I guess I talk a
[1:01:12] lot about this but you know brother
[1:01:15] bradam I I'll just do a couple paragraph
[1:01:17] recap 48 in this uh exposition of the
[1:01:21] seven Church ages out of the revelation
[1:01:22] of Jesus Christ he says you don't just B
[1:01:24] apz in jesus' name there's thousands of
[1:01:26] Jesus in the world right and have been
[1:01:29] even more
[1:01:31] Jesus and have been even before Jesus
[1:01:36] our savior but there's only one of them
[1:01:38] born Christ Lord Jesus Christ people
[1:01:41] talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son
[1:01:44] of God now isn't that a contradiction
[1:01:46] who ever heard of a son being
[1:01:48] Eternal sons have Beginnings but that
[1:01:51] which is eternal never had a beginning
[1:01:54] he is the Eternal god Jehovah manifested
[1:01:57] in
[1:01:58] flesh in St John's
[1:02:01] gospel it says in the beginning was the
[1:02:03] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:02:05] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:02:07] and dwelt Among Us yes he was the true
[1:02:10] and faithful witness to the father's
[1:02:13] Eternal
[1:02:15] Word he was the true and faithful
[1:02:17] witness to the father's Eternal Word
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ God's Tabernacle in flesh
[1:02:23] amen he was a prophet and could say what
[1:02:26] the father bade him say he said my
[1:02:29] father is in me this is what Jesus the
[1:02:33] Tabernacle said my father is excuse me
[1:02:36] in Me God has many
[1:02:40] titles I just think this is so good our
[1:02:43] righteousness our peace and everpresent
[1:02:46] and Father and Son and Holy Ghost but he
[1:02:49] has only one human name and that name is
[1:02:53] Jesus amen
[1:02:54] amen I remember when this Revelation
[1:02:58] settled into my heart it was so
[1:03:02] clear brother Logan was
[1:03:05] young still is but he was
[1:03:09] younger and I remember sitting on the on
[1:03:12] the back patio at brother Ken and sister
[1:03:14] Shel at scanon place and I was talking
[1:03:17] to brother Ken and brother Blaine
[1:03:19] Wahlberg about this very topic and and
[1:03:22] it just became so Crystal Clear to me it
[1:03:25] was so evident so real that he only had
[1:03:28] one human
[1:03:29] name I I don't know when the Lord gives
[1:03:32] you Revelations it's amazing it's just
[1:03:34] you remember the time you remember the
[1:03:35] place you remember the smells you
[1:03:37] remember the people you remember when
[1:03:39] it's a revelation it's so real he has
[1:03:43] one human name and that is Jesus amen
[1:03:46] we've all got lots of different titles
[1:03:49] some of us get many different titles in
[1:03:51] our lives but we only have one name true
[1:03:54] and you know isn't it interesting if you
[1:03:57] start to get different names they're
[1:03:58] called Ali aliases not aliases they're
[1:04:03] called aliases and I believe in certain
[1:04:06] places if not everywhere it's illegal to
[1:04:08] start doing that it's an impersonation
[1:04:10] you can't have multiple names you can't
[1:04:12] have one name on a passport and another
[1:04:14] name on a driver's license and another
[1:04:16] name on a marriage certificate and
[1:04:18] another name on a bank account you can't
[1:04:20] do that you can't do that with titles
[1:04:23] you have to have your name who are you
[1:04:28] yes paragraph 53 don't be confused
[1:04:32] because he has three offices or that he
[1:04:35] has three has a three-fold
[1:04:38] manifestation on Earth he was a prophet
[1:04:40] in heaven he is the priest and coming
[1:04:43] back to Earth he is the king of kings he
[1:04:46] that was that is Jesus the
[1:04:49] prophet he that is that is he the high
[1:04:53] priest making inter intercession one who
[1:04:56] can be touched with the feelings of our
[1:05:00] infirmities which is to come that is the
[1:05:03] coming King on Earth he was the word the
[1:05:06] prophet Moses said of him the prophet a
[1:05:10] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[1:05:13] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[1:05:16] him shall ye hear in all things whatever
[1:05:19] he shall say unto you and it shall come
[1:05:23] to pass that every Soul who will not
[1:05:25] hear that prophit shall be destroyed
[1:05:28] from among the
[1:05:30] people Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:32] today and forever you know today we can
[1:05:35] look at this and say well there's lots
[1:05:38] of people that just you know hear the
[1:05:40] word of the prophet and just do their
[1:05:42] own thing with it or maybe just
[1:05:44] disregard it entirely or maybe can't
[1:05:46] even hear it they think it's crazy it's
[1:05:47] Madness but they still live and they get
[1:05:50] by you know I I believe it's in the book
[1:05:53] of Hab cck the Lord said just consider
[1:05:56] their end yeah don't don't look at them
[1:05:58] right now in their circumstances but
[1:06:00] consider what the end of them is going
[1:06:02] to be I I we're in a a a loner car our
[1:06:05] vehicle's in the shop and we have the
[1:06:07] luxury of satellite radio and so it's
[1:06:11] it's kind of interesting to see all the
[1:06:12] different channels that are on there and
[1:06:15] and I know people are saying where you
[1:06:16] going with this brother Barry there's a
[1:06:18] channel for America's Pastor Billy
[1:06:22] Graham and so rather than all the
[1:06:25] rubbish that's on there I just put it on
[1:06:27] there and just let it play and I I
[1:06:28] listen and think about the way he's
[1:06:30] talking and think you know the prophet
[1:06:32] for our day for our age spoke about this
[1:06:35] man we we had the the the blessing of
[1:06:38] actually going and seeing the library
[1:06:40] and how he impacted the world and you
[1:06:42] know World evangelist American Pastor
[1:06:45] that's what they called him and it's
[1:06:46] just incredible to see the anointing of
[1:06:49] of those two witnesses that went down to
[1:06:52] Sodom is what our Prophet said right and
[1:06:54] to hear him speak he was talking today I
[1:06:58] was driving and I just I just heard him
[1:06:59] talk about how there's coming a day
[1:07:01] where there's going to be sheep and
[1:07:03] there's going to be goats a and which
[1:07:06] one are you a and you're going to be
[1:07:08] standing before that throne and he's
[1:07:10] just hammering this just saying it with
[1:07:13] such anointing and conviction and I'm
[1:07:16] thinking boy oh boy I'm not one of those
[1:07:19] I'm neither I'm going to be with him in
[1:07:21] his throne I just couldn't help but
[1:07:24] think I got to talk about that tonight
[1:07:25] we're not going to have to stand before
[1:07:27] his throne if we have the ability to
[1:07:29] receive this
[1:07:30] word but that's what many people are
[1:07:33] believing they're going to stand before
[1:07:35] his throne we had a Prophet come and say
[1:07:38] that you're you're not you're not guilty
[1:07:41] you never did it in the first
[1:07:44] place just
[1:07:47] incredible but don't be confused because
[1:07:49] he has three offices oh sorry I need to
[1:07:51] carry on paragraph 54 notice these facts
[1:07:55] about Jesus on Earth he was a prophet
[1:07:57] lamb and son this did not make him three
[1:08:01] these were but manifestations or offices
[1:08:04] of the one person
[1:08:07] Jesus why now there's a very favorite
[1:08:11] portion of scripture that the
[1:08:12] trinitarians think proves their point of
[1:08:15] more than one actual person in the
[1:08:19] godhead and behold and lo in the midst
[1:08:22] of the throne and of the four be and in
[1:08:24] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[1:08:26] it had been slain having seven horns and
[1:08:29] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:08:31] of God sent forth into all the
[1:08:33] Earth and he came and took the book out
[1:08:36] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:08:38] the throne and when he had taken the
[1:08:40] book The Four beasts the four and 20
[1:08:42] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:08:45] every one of them Harps golden vials
[1:08:48] full of odors which are the prayers of
[1:08:51] the Saints Revelations 5 6
[1:08:57] to8 paragraph 56 says yes indeed these
[1:09:00] verses if isolated would seem to prove
[1:09:03] their point you notice I said these
[1:09:07] isolated
[1:09:08] verses however read on and immediately I
[1:09:12] was in the spirit and behold the throne
[1:09:13] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:09:16] throne and he that sat was to look upon
[1:09:19] like a Jasper and a sardine stone and
[1:09:21] there was a rainbow round about the
[1:09:24] throne in the sight in sight like unto
[1:09:27] an emerald and when those beasts give
[1:09:30] their glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:09:32] that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:09:34] forever and ever the four and 20 Elders
[1:09:37] fall down before him that sat on the
[1:09:39] throne and worship him that liveth
[1:09:42] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[1:09:44] Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy
[1:09:47] O Lord to receive glory and honor and
[1:09:50] power for thou Hast created all things
[1:09:53] in for thy
[1:09:54] pleasure they are and were created
[1:09:58] Revelations 42:3 and
[1:10:01] 9-11 now he goes on to say carefully
[1:10:04] note in verse two it says one not two or
[1:10:08] three one sat on the
[1:10:12] throne in verse three it says he not
[1:10:15] they was to look upon as a jasper
[1:10:18] stone in verse n it says that the Beast
[1:10:22] gave honor to him not them in verse 10
[1:10:26] it says that the elders fell down before
[1:10:29] him not them in verse 11 it says that
[1:10:34] they cried Thou Art Worthy oh Lord not
[1:10:38] Lords also in verse 11 it says this one
[1:10:42] on the throne was the creator which is
[1:10:45] Jesus John
[1:10:48] 1:3 which is Jehovah Spirit god of the
[1:10:52] Old Testament Genesis 1:1 but let us not
[1:10:56] stop there read on to him that
[1:10:59] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:11:01] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:11:04] am sat down with my father in his
[1:11:07] throne looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:11:10] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:11:12] that was set before him endured the
[1:11:14] cross despising the shame and is sat
[1:11:16] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:11:19] God you know we can read that with
[1:11:22] Revelation revelation 3:21 to him that
[1:11:25] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:11:26] in my Throne I I just wonder where uh
[1:11:31] you know I'll say brother Billy Graham
[1:11:33] was with that scripture how that could
[1:11:35] just be omitted or or not talked
[1:11:39] about right we know that it wasn't his
[1:11:42] anointing to to speak about it but it
[1:11:44] just somebody has to fulfill that
[1:11:46] scripture yes and I'll go back to the
[1:11:49] scripture that we started with tonight
[1:11:51] that that has just been ringing true in
[1:11:54] my heart for the last few months verse 5
[1:11:58] of Malachi chter 4 behold I will send
[1:12:01] you Elijah the
[1:12:04] prophet I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:12:08] he's going to send Elijah the prophet to
[1:12:11] somebody somebody has to be able to
[1:12:13] perceive that there's a prophet yes amen
[1:12:16] when is that going to
[1:12:18] happen I would just throw it out there
[1:12:20] for people that say maybe what we talk
[1:12:23] about we believe is kind of out there
[1:12:25] and it's not according to the
[1:12:25] theological teachings okay let's just
[1:12:28] try and rationalize it then if it hasn't
[1:12:31] happen when is it going
[1:12:33] to the word of God says that I'll send
[1:12:36] you Elijah the
[1:12:38] prophet
[1:12:40] yes I mean know some people will say
[1:12:42] well that was potentially John the
[1:12:43] Baptist and we don't want to go too far
[1:12:45] into that but I just can't help but say
[1:12:47] you know when I read that word you that
[1:12:48] means me I will send you Elijah the
[1:12:51] prophet he sent me Elijah the prophet
[1:12:55] it's just
[1:12:57] beautiful carrying
[1:12:59] on carrying on in our discussion here
[1:13:02] out of the exposition of the seven
[1:13:05] Church
[1:13:06] ages paragraph 56 says indeed these
[1:13:09] verses
[1:13:12] uh yes indeed these verses if isolated
[1:13:16] would seem to prove their
[1:13:18] point uh
[1:13:20] no
[1:13:22] no
[1:13:24] sorry I just feel off today I
[1:13:27] apologize I do I know that uh it's just
[1:13:32] the way it is sometimes in this human
[1:13:34] flesh that we're in but I haven't taken
[1:13:37] any uh anything for it so I know we're
[1:13:41] at paragraph 58
[1:13:43] here know the devil just wants to mix it
[1:13:45] up too because this is the truth this is
[1:13:47] the word amen amen paragraph 58 says
[1:13:49] notice that according to Jesus himself
[1:13:52] who wrote wrote in the Revelation he is
[1:13:55] set down with the father
[1:13:59] sorry I missed Hebrews 122 we're going
[1:14:01] to go back and read that it's after
[1:14:03] Revelations 3:21 in this book here he
[1:14:05] says looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:14:07] finisher of our faith we read that on
[1:14:10] Sunday WHo for the joy that was set
[1:14:12] before him he endured the cross
[1:14:13] despising the shame and is sat down at
[1:14:15] the right hand of the Throne of God and
[1:14:16] I'm going to throw this in there for
[1:14:19] you and me he took all of our shame he
[1:14:22] took it to the cross
[1:14:24] and and now he's sitting down on the
[1:14:26] right hand of the father in the power
[1:14:27] seat with the father for us just holding
[1:14:30] the seat for us when we actually go to
[1:14:33] the other side it's a beautiful thing
[1:14:37] now paragraph 58 notice that according
[1:14:40] to Jesus himself who wore who wrote in
[1:14:43] Revelation he is set down with the
[1:14:46] Father the spirit in Paul which spirit
[1:14:50] is the spirit of Christ for that is the
[1:14:52] spirit of of Prophecy whereby the word
[1:14:56] comes says he is sat down at the right
[1:14:59] hand of God but when John looked he saw
[1:15:03] only one upon the throne why didn't he
[1:15:06] see him sitting down beside the
[1:15:09] throne and it was not until Revelations
[1:15:12] 56-8 which follows revelations 42-3 in
[1:15:15] sequence of
[1:15:17] time that we see the lamb taking the
[1:15:20] book from him
[1:15:25] that sat on the throne as indicated in
[1:15:27] Revelations 42:3 and 9-10 what is it it
[1:15:33] is the mystery of one
[1:15:35] God he Jesus came out from God became
[1:15:41] manifested in flesh died and rose again
[1:15:46] and returned to the bosom of the father
[1:15:49] as John said in chapter 1 and verse 18
[1:15:51] the only begotten son son which is in
[1:15:54] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[1:15:59] him we know the disciples said show us
[1:16:03] the father and it will
[1:16:05] suffice and and he said to him have I
[1:16:07] been with you that long haven't I been
[1:16:10] with you so long and you still don't
[1:16:13] actually understand you don't perceive
[1:16:15] who is actually with
[1:16:17] you but it's it's Christ The Mystery of
[1:16:21] God revealed
[1:16:24] and uh I I just think it's so beautiful
[1:16:26] we can take it for granted that we
[1:16:28] understand that and I apologize if it
[1:16:31] seems Elementary that I just labor on it
[1:16:34] but I just think there's there's so much
[1:16:36] in here it's like mining every every
[1:16:39] time you go a little further something
[1:16:41] just pops up and you can polish it a
[1:16:43] little bit and talk about it some more
[1:16:46] it's
[1:16:48] fantastic paragraph
[1:16:50] 59 it was now time for God Messiah to to
[1:16:53] come back to claim his bride and then
[1:16:55] present himself make himself known to
[1:16:58] Israel thus we see God again stepping
[1:17:01] forth to assume a physical relationship
[1:17:04] to man as the son of David king of kings
[1:17:08] and Lord of lords and bridegroom of the
[1:17:12] Gentile bride hallelujah it's not two
[1:17:15] Gods but simply one God
[1:17:19] manifesting his mighty Triune offices
[1:17:23] and
[1:17:25] titles the people knew he was a prophet
[1:17:28] they knew the sign of the Messiah which
[1:17:31] would come only through the
[1:17:41] prophet now Philip was of
[1:17:44] besida the city of Andrew and Peter
[1:17:48] Philip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto
[1:17:50] him we have found him of whom most Moses
[1:17:53] in the law and the prophets did right
[1:17:55] Jesus of Nazareth the son of
[1:17:58] Joseph the natural senses just
[1:18:01] identifying him bringing him to a a way
[1:18:04] they could
[1:18:05] comprehend and Nathaniel said unto him
[1:18:09] can there any good thing come out of
[1:18:11] Nazareth Philip saith unto him come and
[1:18:14] see yeah come and see for yourself Jesus
[1:18:17] saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of
[1:18:20] him behold an Israelite indeed in whom
[1:18:23] is no gu Nathaniel saith unto him whence
[1:18:26] knowest thou
[1:18:28] me Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:18:31] before Philip called thee when thou was
[1:18:34] under the Fig Tree I saw
[1:18:39] thee Nathaniel answered and saith unto
[1:18:41] him Rabbi art thou Thou Art the Son of
[1:18:44] God Thou Art the king of
[1:18:46] Israel Jesus a answered and said unto
[1:18:50] him because I said unto thee I saw thee
[1:18:53] under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou
[1:18:56] shalt see greater things than
[1:18:58] these and he saith unto him verily
[1:19:01] verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall
[1:19:04] see Heaven open and the angels of God
[1:19:07] ascending and descending upon the son of
[1:19:14] man that's John 1:44 to
[1:19:18] 51 now we're going to get into kind of
[1:19:21] what I had thought would be a real good
[1:19:24] place just to sort of dwell for the last
[1:19:26] part of the service tonight and that is
[1:19:29] the ability to discern the heart
[1:19:31] thoughts in
[1:19:40] men it's a tremendous thing because we
[1:19:44] know that the ability to discern the
[1:19:46] heart thoughts in men is not something
[1:19:49] that me men can
[1:19:51] do it's not
[1:19:54] telepathy it's not uh anything man-made
[1:19:58] it's truly the spirit of
[1:20:01] God but he says here in paragraph 61 the
[1:20:04] ability to discern the heart thoughts in
[1:20:07] men made the elect of God to understand
[1:20:12] that here was the
[1:20:14] Messiah the anointed word of
[1:20:17] God and we we know that it says here
[1:20:20] Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[1:20:22] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:20:24] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:20:27] defining aunder of Soul and Spirit and
[1:20:30] the joints and
[1:20:31] Marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:20:34] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:20:35] this scripture clearly identifies that
[1:20:38] the word of God goes beyond our
[1:20:40] comprehension it goes all beyond all of
[1:20:43] our natural senses beyond the the the
[1:20:46] bones and the flesh our Flesh and Blood
[1:20:49] even our spiritual realm it goes beyond
[1:20:51] all of that goes right down to the very
[1:20:54] heart of men and we know that as a man
[1:20:58] thinketh in his heart so is he right
[1:21:01] into the very control center of a human
[1:21:03] being's life that's what the word of God
[1:21:06] does it's quick and powerful and sharper
[1:21:10] it it's quick it has life power the the
[1:21:13] word of God the Throne of of power and
[1:21:18] is sharper than any any two-edged sword
[1:21:20] it it will go anywhere it can discern
[1:21:23] anything there's nothing that will stop
[1:21:25] the word of God it's so beautiful amen I
[1:21:28] love that thought we could probably just
[1:21:30] preach a whole sermon on that Hebrews
[1:21:32] 4:12 but you know I I I just want to get
[1:21:35] into sort of where we left off last week
[1:21:38] and and and push forward a little bit we
[1:21:40] ended with the scripture in Colossians
[1:21:42] chapter 2 verse 8 beware lest any man
[1:21:47] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[1:21:51] deceit after the tradition of
[1:21:53] men after the rudiments of the world and
[1:21:57] not after Christ how would we know
[1:22:01] whether something is actually being
[1:22:03] presented in such a way that it's going
[1:22:05] to be after the traditions of men or
[1:22:08] after the rudiments of the world and not
[1:22:10] after Christ it's a real simple answer
[1:22:13] brothers and sisters and we all know it
[1:22:15] I know it but I'm just going to say it
[1:22:17] and and that's simple it will go with
[1:22:19] the word from the Vindicated Prophet it
[1:22:21] will be right in line line with what the
[1:22:23] Vindicated Prophet said and if it
[1:22:25] doesn't go right in line with what the
[1:22:26] Vindicated Prophet said then it is going
[1:22:29] to be vain deceit after the tradition of
[1:22:32] men after the rudiments of the world and
[1:22:34] not after Christ notice when Paul we
[1:22:37] talked about at the very beginning of
[1:22:38] the topic tonight when he went up to
[1:22:40] Jerusalem he didn't go to the
[1:22:43] scholars he went to the Brethren he went
[1:22:45] to Peter he went to the the ignorant and
[1:22:48] the unlearned he went to the Believers
[1:22:50] he didn't go to the religious people he
[1:22:52] didn't go to the Seminary teachers and
[1:22:55] we know that's one thing that brother
[1:22:56] bradam did in his life didn't he when he
[1:22:58] first started to have the experiences he
[1:23:00] he went to see the the the the pastor of
[1:23:03] the church that he was attending and
[1:23:04] what did he tell them he said you know
[1:23:06] it's of the devil it's not according to
[1:23:09] the the the the philosophy that we
[1:23:12] taught that we teach it's not according
[1:23:15] to our vain deceit he didn't say that
[1:23:17] but it's not according to our Traditions
[1:23:20] it's of the devil you need to forget
[1:23:22] about what you're talking about an angel
[1:23:25] saying that you're going to go you go
[1:23:26] and pray for kings and
[1:23:31] potentates verse N9 says for in him
[1:23:33] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:23:36] bodily speaking about Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ and ye are complete in him isn't
[1:23:43] that
[1:23:43] beautiful you're complete in him which
[1:23:46] is the head of all principality and
[1:23:48] Power in whom also ye are circumcised
[1:23:51] with the circumcision not made
[1:23:53] circumcision made without hands in
[1:23:55] putting off the body of the sins of
[1:23:57] Flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[1:24:00] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[1:24:03] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:24:06] of the operation of God who hath raised
[1:24:09] him from the
[1:24:11] dead the quickening
[1:24:13] power but you know brother bradam in our
[1:24:16] our our our age he said there's many
[1:24:20] people that claim bride bride Revival
[1:24:23] Revival but he says it there has to be
[1:24:26] one there has to be one that has the
[1:24:29] mechanics that the Dynamics comes to and
[1:24:32] when that happens brothers and sisters
[1:24:34] something's going to happen we're not
[1:24:36] going to be able to sit still we're not
[1:24:38] going to be able to come to a song
[1:24:39] service and just say I'm just upset
[1:24:41] about this thing and not worship we're
[1:24:43] going to push it all aside when we come
[1:24:44] through those doors and we're going to
[1:24:46] just give the Lord the glory that he
[1:24:47] desires we can't wait to worship
[1:24:50] him but you know I just think it's
[1:24:53] beautiful we don't want to be beguiled
[1:24:56] it says beware lest any man spoil you we
[1:24:59] have to beware we've got to be wise as
[1:25:02] serpents but harmless as doves just
[1:25:05] recognize and I think that you know the
[1:25:07] ability to discern the heart thoughts in
[1:25:09] men there's a correlation in the word of
[1:25:12] God with the word that we have for our
[1:25:15] day talking about the ability to discern
[1:25:18] the heart thoughts in men that's not
[1:25:19] something that anybody can do people
[1:25:22] will try and impersonate it but when
[1:25:25] it's God it's going to be 100% accuracy
[1:25:28] every single time according to Hebrews
[1:25:31] the the scripture that we read Hebrews
[1:25:34] 4:12 but there is a correlation to this
[1:25:36] and I think it's good just to maybe go
[1:25:38] back a little bit and talk about
[1:25:41] it once I'm done
[1:25:43] coughing and that is in Exodus chapter 4
[1:25:46] maybe you want to turn with me tonight
[1:25:48] as we spend the last few
[1:25:51] minutes
[1:25:53] Exodus chapter
[1:25:55] 4 he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:01] forever amen Exodus chapter
[1:26:08] 4 verse one talking about the ability to
[1:26:12] discern the heart thoughts in
[1:26:15] men Exodus 4:1 and Moses answered and
[1:26:18] said but behold they will not believe me
[1:26:23] nor hearken unto my
[1:26:25] voice is that right I don't know if
[1:26:29] that's
[1:26:32] right
[1:26:33] sorry I've got a few different types of
[1:26:36] notes here and I just want to make sure
[1:26:38] that I'm not
[1:26:41] misleading bear with
[1:26:44] me Exodus chapter 4 yeah and Moses
[1:26:47] answered and said but behold they will
[1:26:49] not believe me nor hearken unto my voice
[1:26:58] why we know that he's already had the
[1:27:01] call from the Lord the burning bush he's
[1:27:04] given him the the direction to come
[1:27:07] closer take off your shoes it's it's God
[1:27:09] giving him the commission here and Moses
[1:27:12] answering him they will not hear believe
[1:27:14] me nor hearken unto my voice for they
[1:27:16] will say the Lord hath not appeared unto
[1:27:19] thee yeah and the Lord said unto him
[1:27:22] what is in thine hand and he said a rod
[1:27:25] and he said cast it on the ground and he
[1:27:27] cast it on the ground and it became a
[1:27:28] serpent and Moses fled from before it
[1:27:32] and the Lord said unto Moses put forth
[1:27:34] thine
[1:27:35] hand and take it by the tail and he put
[1:27:38] forth his hand and caught it and it
[1:27:40] became a rod in his
[1:27:42] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[1:27:45] God of their fathers and the god of
[1:27:47] Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[1:27:50] Jacob hath appeared unto to
[1:27:53] thee so I'll give you a
[1:27:58] sign verse six and the Lord said
[1:28:00] furthermore unto him put now thine hand
[1:28:03] into thine bosom and he put his hand
[1:28:05] into his bosom and when he took it out
[1:28:06] behold his hand was lepus as
[1:28:09] snow and he said put thine hand into thy
[1:28:12] bosom again and he put his hand into his
[1:28:14] bosom again and plucked it out of his
[1:28:17] bosom and behold it was turned again as
[1:28:19] his other
[1:28:20] flesh and it shall come to pass if they
[1:28:23] will not believe thee neither hearken to
[1:28:26] the voice of the first sign that they
[1:28:29] will believe the voice of the latter
[1:28:31] signs and it shall come to pass that if
[1:28:35] they will not believe also these two
[1:28:37] signs neither hearken unto thy voice
[1:28:39] that thou shalt take of the water of the
[1:28:41] river and pour it upon the dry land and
[1:28:45] the water which thou takest out of the
[1:28:46] river shall become blood upon the dry
[1:28:51] land
[1:28:52] excuse
[1:28:54] me and we know I'm not going to go too
[1:28:57] much further with this Moses he says
[1:28:59] Lord I'm not eloquent I I don't know how
[1:29:01] I can do this I stutter I I I don't feel
[1:29:03] qualified my feelings My Flesh my senses
[1:29:07] and we know God says you know you don't
[1:29:09] understand any of this you've been
[1:29:10] called you know step up you're going to
[1:29:12] do this yes amen but what I want to get
[1:29:15] to is there is a correlation with this
[1:29:17] to what we're talking about tonight the
[1:29:19] ability to discern the thoughts that are
[1:29:21] in the hearts of men God calling someone
[1:29:24] and giving them a commission and saying
[1:29:28] that I'll give you a sign to capture the
[1:29:30] attention of the people so that they
[1:29:32] will understand that this is more than
[1:29:34] just a man this is more than just a
[1:29:36] Ministry this is
[1:29:38] God and and I'm just going to read a
[1:29:41] couple of quotes here the first one uh
[1:29:44] is how the angel came to me in his
[1:29:46] Commission in
[1:29:49] 1955 just to bring a little bit bit of a
[1:29:52] a background to to what we're reading
[1:29:55] and and and the the Scribe that God
[1:29:58] chose to actually write this book
[1:30:00] here paragraph 153 he I said looked at
[1:30:04] him like that he's talking about
[1:30:07] speaking to the angel of the Lord coming
[1:30:09] to him and giving him his commission he
[1:30:11] saido not fear the angel said to him
[1:30:13] just as quiet said I am sent from the
[1:30:17] presence of almighty God to tell you
[1:30:19] that your peculiar birth
[1:30:22] as you
[1:30:23] know what my birth was up there that
[1:30:27] same light hung over me when I was first
[1:30:29] born and so he said your peculiar birth
[1:30:32] and misunderstood life has been to
[1:30:35] indicate that you're to go to all the
[1:30:38] world to pray for the sick
[1:30:42] people and said and regardless of what
[1:30:45] they have and he
[1:30:48] designated God who's my judge knows that
[1:30:52] he designated
[1:30:54] cancer said nothing if you get the
[1:30:57] people to believe you and be sincere
[1:30:59] when you pray nothing shall stand before
[1:31:02] your prayer not even cancer Hallelujah
[1:31:06] see if you get the people to believe
[1:31:11] you I could pause there and just just
[1:31:15] let that so isn't that beautiful if you
[1:31:17] can get the people to believe you yes
[1:31:21] that's why we follow the the word of a
[1:31:23] Vindicated Prophet not because we want
[1:31:25] to see cancer annihilated but we do but
[1:31:29] we want to see the Lord give us the
[1:31:31] power to overcome in this world we need
[1:31:33] healing for our bodies Here and Now not
[1:31:36] over in the
[1:31:38] Millennium but if you can get the people
[1:31:40] to believe not even cancer will stand in
[1:31:42] the way of your prayers my goodness
[1:31:46] amen I was just thinking about it today
[1:31:48] when I was studying it not even cancer
[1:31:51] was will stand in the way of your
[1:31:52] prayers how can cancer stand in the way
[1:31:54] of a
[1:31:55] prayer it's a
[1:31:58] devil it just created a visual for me
[1:32:01] that I thought was real interesting and
[1:32:03] and that is that every time we pray is
[1:32:04] there a devil trying to stand in the
[1:32:07] way is it trying to jump in the path of
[1:32:10] our prayer trying to hinder our prayers
[1:32:12] from getting to the throne just because
[1:32:15] the way this is worded is the only
[1:32:16] reason I started to think about it it
[1:32:17] will stand in the way of your prayer
[1:32:20] what
[1:32:22] I know we live in the natural we we see
[1:32:24] it with our senses you know it's it's
[1:32:25] it's cancer that gets in our body and
[1:32:27] and and we have to deal with it that way
[1:32:29] but it just made me think about it
[1:32:31] there's a spiritual element to this as
[1:32:33] well we know it's a
[1:32:37] devil and I seen he wasn't my enemy the
[1:32:40] angel of the Lord he was my friend and I
[1:32:44] didn't know whether I was dying or or
[1:32:46] what was happening when he was coming up
[1:32:49] to me like that and I said well sir I
[1:32:53] said I am what did I know about healings
[1:32:56] and things like that those gifts I said
[1:32:59] well sir I am a poor man in interesting
[1:33:03] dialogue hey similar to what Moses said
[1:33:05] if you were to go away probably should
[1:33:07] have read it but for time's sake I just
[1:33:08] wanted to get into this similar
[1:33:11] discussion though we we start to look at
[1:33:12] ourselves and say how could I ever do
[1:33:14] this and and and it's great because we
[1:33:16] can't nobody ever can that's right it's
[1:33:19] got to be God living out through us
[1:33:22] he says well sir I'm I'm a poor man and
[1:33:24] I said I'm I'm among my people I live
[1:33:27] with my people who is poor I'm
[1:33:28] uneducated and I said I I would not be
[1:33:32] able they'd not they'd not understand me
[1:33:35] said they wouldn't they wouldn't hear me
[1:33:38] just about exactly the same
[1:33:42] dialogue and he said as the prophet
[1:33:44] Moses was given two gifts
[1:33:47] signs rather to vindicate his ministry
[1:33:50] so will you be given to so are you given
[1:33:55] two gifts to vindicate your ministry he
[1:33:57] said one of them will be that you will
[1:33:59] take the person that you're praying for
[1:34:02] by the hand with your left hand and
[1:34:05] their right and said then just stand
[1:34:08] quiet and it'll there will be a physical
[1:34:10] effect that will happen on your body and
[1:34:11] said then you'll pray and if it leaves
[1:34:13] the disease is gone from the people and
[1:34:15] if it doesn't leave just ask a blessing
[1:34:18] and walk
[1:34:19] away well I said sir I'm afraid they
[1:34:22] won't receive me he said and the next
[1:34:26] thing will be didn't even hear him
[1:34:28] didn't even discuss that with them just
[1:34:30] simply said this is going to happen and
[1:34:32] you're going to do it he said the next
[1:34:35] thing will be that they if they won't
[1:34:38] hear that then they will hear this said
[1:34:40] then it'll come to pass that you'll know
[1:34:42] the very secret of their heart said this
[1:34:47] they will
[1:34:49] hear and you know now we're getting into
[1:34:51] where we wanted to get to the ability to
[1:34:53] discern the heart thoughts in men made
[1:34:56] the elect of God to understand that here
[1:34:59] was the Messiah the anointed word of God
[1:35:03] talking about the disciples but what
[1:35:04] about today
[1:35:06] Hallelujah this is the sign of the
[1:35:09] Messiah brothers and sisters we had a
[1:35:11] prophet in our age say I'm here to
[1:35:14] declare he's
[1:35:16] here we know that we're going to see him
[1:35:19] in the clouds that's going to happen yes
[1:35:21] but first there's a word coming amen and
[1:35:24] we're experiencing that we're
[1:35:26] experiencing the appearing of Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ and we know then the coming
[1:35:30] that's happening I'm not going to try
[1:35:32] and get into that tonight but what I
[1:35:34] want to say is that there's a real real
[1:35:37] correlation here to the ability to
[1:35:39] discern the heart thoughts of men and
[1:35:41] how we talk about the prophet it's no
[1:35:43] different than the prophet Moses and how
[1:35:47] he was called and told he would be given
[1:35:48] two signs and some people the carinal
[1:35:50] mind would say say well he's just
[1:35:52] impersonating that but really A A A
[1:35:55] ministry that's been Vindicated by God
[1:35:56] went around the world seven times how
[1:35:59] many times was there a Miss in in in the
[1:36:01] discernments in the healings how many
[1:36:03] times was there not one nobody can bring
[1:36:05] forth proof that someone didn't actually
[1:36:07] get healed exactly according to the word
[1:36:09] of God with this
[1:36:11] ministry thousands hundreds of thousands
[1:36:14] of people healed Believers unbelievers
[1:36:16] people got healed that's just the way it
[1:36:18] was right but there was a transition in
[1:36:21] his
[1:36:22] ministry and we'll probably wind up
[1:36:24] spending the last 10 minutes on that and
[1:36:26] that was in Regina Saskatchewan
[1:36:28] Hallelujah and I believe it was in
[1:36:30] 1950 I I could be wrong it was real
[1:36:33] close to that where it changed from just
[1:36:36] the discernment in in taking someone's
[1:36:38] hand and being able to heal them and
[1:36:40] there's there's no question that was a
[1:36:42] tremendous Ministry but we know I think
[1:36:45] it was brother Bosworth that said uh
[1:36:47] it's just simply the bait on the hook
[1:36:49] it's to get the attention of the people
[1:36:50] it's to attract the attention of the
[1:36:52] people to the word to understand that
[1:36:55] the word of God the sign the true sign
[1:36:57] of the Messiah is actually here a little
[1:37:00] bit later on it's actually the next
[1:37:01] paragraph brother Bram he tells this
[1:37:03] story over and over and over again in
[1:37:06] his ministry the story of the woman at
[1:37:08] the well yes Amen in the messages when
[1:37:11] that woman saw this man sitting there
[1:37:14] discern her very thoughts her very heart
[1:37:17] her problems and her troubles in her
[1:37:19] life something happened in her and we
[1:37:22] know that she recognized it she was
[1:37:24] taught there would be a messiah who
[1:37:26] would be able to do that he would be a
[1:37:27] prophet and because of that
[1:37:30] sign she was able to discern it and go
[1:37:33] and tell everyone hey come see a man
[1:37:35] who's told me the things that I've
[1:37:37] done the next quote is a little bit of a
[1:37:40] long one hopefully it won't keep
[1:37:44] us uh I I'm just trying to find
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:51] excuse me it's out of Moses 1950
[1:37:58] 0110 comes up at the bottom I uh got
[1:38:02] stimulated before we got in here
[1:38:04] and it's wonderful when the Lord does
[1:38:07] that brother Bram he says well that has
[1:38:10] come to pass talking about the first
[1:38:13] part of his ministry being able to take
[1:38:14] someone by the hand that has come to
[1:38:17] pass and then the next one is the
[1:38:19] Discerning of the heart thoughts of men
[1:38:22] well that has come to pass it was
[1:38:24] standing at Calgary or at Regina
[1:38:27] Saskatchewan last about 3 months
[1:38:30] ago and I was standing on the platform
[1:38:33] talking like this to my
[1:38:35] audience we were having a great
[1:38:43] meeting some I guess close to 10,000
[1:38:46] people were gathered in for that night
[1:38:49] at the Pavilion can you imagine that
[1:38:50] many
[1:38:52] people or the queen Gardens it was out
[1:38:56] where they have the Stampede and I was
[1:38:58] speaking and I said now the Lord has
[1:39:00] told me that if I be sincere that
[1:39:02] someday I did at each meeting it would
[1:39:05] come to pass that the secrets of
[1:39:07] people's heart would be
[1:39:09] told I'll just give you this before we
[1:39:12] close and I turned around to get a drink
[1:39:14] on the platform and they was forming a
[1:39:16] prayer line and when I turned around to
[1:39:18] get a drink Reverend Mr Baxter my Ian
[1:39:21] manager I was taking a drink of water
[1:39:23] and he had taken his handkerchief and
[1:39:25] was wiping the perspiration off of my
[1:39:26] forehead he said God bless you brother
[1:39:28] brandom I said thank you brother Baxter
[1:39:30] I turned around he walked around and
[1:39:33] there stood a lady standing by the
[1:39:36] microphone or been brought up from the
[1:39:38] prayer line and I walked over like that
[1:39:41] and as I looked at the lady I said how'
[1:39:43] he do she said how do he do something
[1:39:46] happened I knew there was something that
[1:39:48] happened
[1:39:50] somewhere
[1:39:52] I never felt like that
[1:39:54] before it was that
[1:39:57] anointing it doesn't feel like the holy
[1:40:00] spirit it's a real sacred
[1:40:03] feeling I can't help but think that's
[1:40:06] where the angel of the Lord stepped into
[1:40:08] his presence where he got into that
[1:40:11] place because he said it didn't feel
[1:40:13] like the Holy Spirit a real sacred
[1:40:16] feeling and I looked at that woman and
[1:40:19] she was standing there her regular
[1:40:25] size and I seen her get real little and
[1:40:29] start going back now you'll hear that
[1:40:32] spoke right here and I seen a little
[1:40:34] bitty girl standing way down where she
[1:40:37] went down to a little bitty girl of
[1:40:39] about 12 years old and I seen her
[1:40:41] sitting by a desk I said something's
[1:40:43] happening friends I see a little girl
[1:40:46] that woman left me I said I see a little
[1:40:50] a little girl she's sitting in the room
[1:40:52] she's a a school room she's hitting her
[1:40:55] pencil no it's a pen oh I said I see it
[1:40:57] Fly and it struck her in the
[1:41:02] eye and the woman began screaming began
[1:41:06] to
[1:41:06] scream it left off she said brother Bram
[1:41:09] that was me I'm blind in my right
[1:41:13] eye she said the pen I said well I never
[1:41:17] had anything like that I said
[1:41:19] well say and there she went back again I
[1:41:23] seen a young lady about 16 years old and
[1:41:25] she was just running as hard as she
[1:41:27] could she had a big ribbon tied on her
[1:41:31] hair and a double plate hanging down her
[1:41:33] back she had on a checker dress and she
[1:41:36] was running real fast and I looked and
[1:41:37] there was a big yellow dog chasing
[1:41:41] her I said I see a young lady with a
[1:41:44] checkered dress begin to tell just what
[1:41:48] I was seeing looking in front of me you
[1:41:50] know only imagine him standing there and
[1:41:53] just seeing this whole thing play
[1:41:56] out everybody sees his eyes open he
[1:42:00] looks like he's normal maybe gazing off
[1:42:02] into space but here he is telling this
[1:42:04] whole story telling the woman about the
[1:42:07] things that she's done who does
[1:42:12] that I want to say this clearly that was
[1:42:14] not William Mary and
[1:42:16] Bram and I would even go further to say
[1:42:19] you know I question I'll say it whether
[1:42:23] that was the angel of the
[1:42:25] Lord I want to say that that was Messiah
[1:42:28] very
[1:42:29] Messiah some would say the angel of the
[1:42:32] Lord but I would say there's only one
[1:42:33] that sat at the woman sat at the well
[1:42:36] where came out and talked to the woman
[1:42:38] and that was the Messiah and he
[1:42:39] identified himself that way he wanted to
[1:42:42] be identified exactly that way so who
[1:42:45] was this here identifying back there oh
[1:42:49] my and how far are we today today
[1:42:50] brothers and
[1:42:52] sisters I see I said I see a young lady
[1:42:55] with a checker dress begin to tell just
[1:42:57] what I was seeing looking in front of me
[1:42:59] I said she goes up on the porch I see a
[1:43:02] lady there take her in she started
[1:43:06] screaming she said that was me when I
[1:43:08] was going to school said I never thought
[1:43:10] of it before in my
[1:43:12] life I said something's happening here
[1:43:14] friends I don't know what's the
[1:43:18] matter and I started I said let me have
[1:43:21] your hand sister I took her by the hand
[1:43:23] and started to I said well I don't feel
[1:43:26] any vibration from
[1:43:28] it so the old thing is passing
[1:43:33] away and I was looking down at her hand
[1:43:36] and I looked up again and I see a lady
[1:43:37] coming from a white house or from a red
[1:43:40] a barn a red looking Barn coming in
[1:43:42] towards a white house she had an apron
[1:43:44] holding something like this and she was
[1:43:46] walking slow and I seen her come I said
[1:43:49] I see a lady coming I said sister it's
[1:43:53] you that was the normal time then I
[1:43:55] could recognize it being the same
[1:43:58] woman excuse me and I said now I see the
[1:44:01] lady you've started up the steps and I
[1:44:04] said there's a flower bed over to your
[1:44:06] right and the steps goes up like this I
[1:44:10] said there's something wrong with your
[1:44:12] back I see you can't get up the steps
[1:44:16] and I said you lean over sideways and
[1:44:17] you're crying and I heard her say if I
[1:44:21] can ever get to brother bram's meeting
[1:44:23] it'll be
[1:44:24] over and when I said that somebody
[1:44:26] caught the woman she started
[1:44:31] fainting can only imagine what would
[1:44:33] happen here at this point in the service
[1:44:38] he she started fainting and when she
[1:44:40] come to her Blind Eye was normal her
[1:44:42] back she could just move any she her
[1:44:46] arthritis was fine she could move her
[1:44:48] back any way just perfectly normal like
[1:44:50] that that and I said well something has
[1:44:53] happened and brother Baxter grabbed the
[1:44:55] microphone he said brother brandom
[1:44:58] that's just what you spoke of a while
[1:44:59] ago would come to pass and everybody
[1:45:03] began screaming all over the building
[1:45:06] everywhere I just think it's beautiful
[1:45:09] that's the spirit of God brothers and
[1:45:11] sisters I just want to say tonight as we
[1:45:12] close I'll call the musicians what about
[1:45:15] today where are we at today we can look
[1:45:17] back and say that was tremendous that
[1:45:19] was amazing in the days of the prophet
[1:45:22] and and and and the services that they
[1:45:24] had but that was in 1950 here we are
[1:45:27] this many years later over 50 years
[1:45:32] later with the opening of the seals the
[1:45:35] full word completely open before us he's
[1:45:38] revealed himself
[1:45:40] entirely
[1:45:42] intimately I just think it's fantastic
[1:45:45] it's amazing the ability to discern the
[1:45:47] heart thoughts in men it made the elect
[1:45:50] of God to understand that here was the
[1:45:55] Messiah that was the
[1:45:57] disciples but also today for the bride
[1:46:00] it gives the bride the ability to
[1:46:02] recognize that here is the
[1:46:05] Messiah the anointed word of
[1:46:08] God you know brothers and sisters don't
[1:46:10] look for the Fantastics don't don't look
[1:46:13] for the tremendous Miracles just let
[1:46:14] them follow they will they have to they
[1:46:18] have to just seek ye first the kingdom
[1:46:20] of God
[1:46:21] make sure that we work out our own
[1:46:23] salvation with fear and trembling and we
[1:46:25] know that God will come on the scene he
[1:46:28] is the discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:46:30] intents of the
[1:46:32] heart but you know the the greatest
[1:46:35] thing today and and I think it just I'm
[1:46:38] going to close here if you want to stand
[1:46:40] with me the greatest thing today is the
[1:46:42] same thing that brother Bram talked
[1:46:44] about which was the greatest thing in in
[1:46:46] Martin Luther's day is the ability for
[1:46:49] Martin Luther to hang hold his head
[1:46:52] above all of the fanaticism that
[1:46:54] happened through his ministry and we can
[1:46:56] look at this message of the hour and
[1:46:58] Only By God's spirit are we able to
[1:47:00] stand above all the fanaticism that's
[1:47:03] gone on in and around this message don't
[1:47:06] take any man's word for it don't let any
[1:47:08] man beguile you through vain Traditions
[1:47:10] or teachings vain philosophies just
[1:47:13] stick with the word of God stick with
[1:47:14] the message of the hour and it will all
[1:47:16] turn out right brothers and sisters
