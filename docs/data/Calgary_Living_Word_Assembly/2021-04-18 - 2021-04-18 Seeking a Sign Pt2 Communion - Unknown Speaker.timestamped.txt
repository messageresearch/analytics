[6:16] that's

[6:20] were a pastor to come tonight
[6:22] just the course tonight oh Turn Your
[6:27] Eyes Upon
[6:30] Jesus it's the only place to look
[6:33] Brothers
[6:41] peace
[6:43] [Music]
[7:12] thank you
[7:28] foreign
[7:40] Hallelujah
[7:42] blessed be the name of the Lord
[7:45] let's just go to him in prayer
[7:47] [Music]
[7:49] our gracious Heavenly Father
[7:52] Lord One More Time We Gather before you
[7:55] Lord the way that you've ordained
[7:59] and we know that it's strange to us Lord
[8:01] but
[8:03] father we just want to try and be
[8:04] obedient unto you
[8:07] Lord we pray that you would bless our
[8:09] little service tonight
[8:11] we pray that you would just take all the
[8:12] awkward out of the way
[8:15] we pray that you would just help us to
[8:16] get past all the unfamiliar
[8:19] we pray that we could just push back all
[8:21] the powers of Darkness that would try
[8:23] and come against us from following your
[8:26] word
[8:27] and we pray that you would just bless
[8:29] each and every one sovereignly according
[8:31] to your will
[8:33] we just ask that you would be glorified
[8:35] most of all Lord Jesus
[8:38] that there wouldn't be another sign that
[8:40] we're looking for because we've been
[8:41] given the entire sign we've been given
[8:43] an open Word
[8:45] father we pray that you would just be
[8:47] glorified now
[8:48] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[8:52] God bless you
[8:54] extremely thank you so much
[8:57] if you have your Bibles tonight
[8:59] we'll just read a little bit
[9:03] I'd like to go back to the The Book of
[9:06] Luke chapter 16 if we can
[9:11] and uh
[9:13] I'm gonna do something a little strange
[9:16] but I think that's what this is the the
[9:19] years of coven strange
[9:23] um maybe just one person if you could if
[9:27] we're together
[9:28] can you just honk your horn
[9:35] I know there's a bit of a delay
[9:38] but I'm wondering if uh if we're
[9:40] streaming if we're together
[9:43] Hallelujah
[9:49] that's wonderful
[9:51] let's turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter
[9:53] 16.
[9:56] we'll start reading from verse 19.
[10:00] and we'll go down to verse 31.
[10:05] there was a certain rich man who was
[10:08] clothed in purple and fine linen and
[10:10] fared sumptuously every day
[10:12] and there was a certain beggar named
[10:14] Lazarus
[10:16] which was laid at his gate full of sores
[10:19] and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs
[10:22] which fell from the rich man's table
[10:23] moreover the dogs came and licked his
[10:26] sores
[10:28] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[10:30] and was carried by the Angels into
[10:31] Abraham's bosom
[10:33] the rich man also died and was buried
[10:37] and in hell he lifted up his eyes and
[10:40] being in torments he seeth Abraham afar
[10:43] off and Lazarus in his bosom
[10:48] isn't it just interesting that he had a
[10:51] real conscious recognition
[10:53] of everyone that he saw
[10:56] especially these two
[10:58] verse 24.
[11:00] and he cried and said Father Abraham
[11:02] have mercy on me and send Lazarus that
[11:05] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[11:07] water and cool my tongue
[11:09] for I am tormented in this Flame
[11:12] but Abraham said Son
[11:14] remember that thou in thy lifetime
[11:16] receiveth thy good things
[11:19] and likewise Lazarus evil things but now
[11:22] he's comforted and thou art tormented
[11:24] beside all this between us and you there
[11:27] was a great Gulf fixed so that they
[11:28] which would pass from hands to you
[11:31] cannot neither can they pass to us that
[11:34] would come from thence
[11:35] then he said I pray thee therefore
[11:37] father that thou wouldstas send him to
[11:39] my father's house for I have five
[11:42] Brethren that he may testify unto them
[11:44] lest they also come into this place of
[11:47] Torment
[11:48] Abraham saith unto him they have Moses
[11:51] and the prophets
[11:52] let them hear them
[11:55] and he said nay Father Abraham but if
[11:58] one went unto them from the dead they
[12:00] would repent
[12:02] and he said unto him if they hear not
[12:04] Moses and the prophets
[12:06] neither would they be persuaded though
[12:09] one rose from the dead
[12:12] let's just bow in prayer once again
[12:15] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[12:16] thankful that you have given us years to
[12:18] hear
[12:19] Lord we never want to take it for
[12:21] granted what you've done for each and
[12:23] every one of us Lord
[12:25] to think that it's only by your grace
[12:27] that we are able to hear the voice of
[12:29] the prophet in our day
[12:31] we know that you never change your
[12:32] program we know that Satan
[12:36] manipulates man and influences man
[12:39] to change your program
[12:41] but you change not
[12:43] that heavens and earth will pass away
[12:45] but you
[12:46] your words will remain
[12:49] and father as much as we are a part of
[12:51] you we can never be lost what a
[12:55] consolation that is
[12:56] father tonight I pray that you would
[12:58] just bless the few words that we speak
[13:00] and more than anything I pray that you
[13:03] would receive the glory in the actions
[13:05] of everyone's Faith who has come out
[13:07] tonight Lord Jesus to give you the glory
[13:09] to partake in your supper we just ask
[13:13] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[13:15] name amen
[13:16] God bless you
[13:18] you may uh
[13:20] have your seats
[13:23] Luke chapter 16 talking about the Rich
[13:26] Young Ruler it's kind of where we left
[13:27] off this morning
[13:29] and I'll try not to go too long now
[13:34] but I just wanted to continue on with
[13:36] seeking a sign
[13:38] and really what the stimulation for this
[13:40] whole discussion was for me was twofold
[13:43] it was seeing these ministers who were
[13:45] going on about their their the one
[13:48] having a great ministry and people
[13:50] elevating him and and so on and another
[13:52] Minister throwing off on on that
[13:54] Minister for the allowing the influence
[13:56] to go on and and me sort of being caught
[13:58] in the middle seeing it saying Lord
[14:00] where's the balance in all of this how
[14:02] does it how does it work and and for him
[14:04] to show me in the message
[14:07] not because I asked him even just
[14:10] because I was in the word feeding he
[14:12] showed me the answer
[14:13] and that is to Simply distance oneself
[14:16] from it and say no that's not acceptable
[14:19] there's only one person that deserves
[14:21] worship and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:23] God almighty Elohim
[14:29] so I just wanted to take a little bit
[14:30] and talk about it and uh you know
[14:32] there's there's folks now today that are
[14:34] talking about seeing the signs around us
[14:36] and is the vaccine the the mark of the
[14:39] beast worldly there's people that were
[14:41] raised in religion and and talking about
[14:43] this and saying that there's a genetic
[14:44] code in the in the vaccine that that
[14:47] that that has the number 666 on it and
[14:50] isn't that interesting that the prophet
[14:52] never said anything about that
[14:54] the prophet for our day he identified
[14:56] 666 and it's the the Roman numerals that
[15:00] are written in Latin I believe it is in
[15:02] the Vatican on the triple crown and I'm
[15:05] sorry it it it it eludes me right now
[15:08] but I can find it for you I'm sure
[15:10] there's a brother that could probably
[15:11] say it right now you know
[15:13] but that's what it is
[15:15] it's a number of a man and we had a
[15:17] prophet clearly identified he didn't say
[15:18] that it was a genetic code inside a
[15:20] vaccine
[15:22] so we need to be very careful what we're
[15:23] feeding on and that's really the one
[15:26] thing that I wanted to get at that was
[15:27] the most important thing sometimes
[15:29] people can share things on the internet
[15:31] via text or whatever just forward
[15:34] something quickly and flippantly and I
[15:36] know that I've been guilty of doing it
[15:37] but brothers and sisters we have to be
[15:39] careful the information that we do that
[15:41] with because all of the information that
[15:44] we get and receive and and filters
[15:46] through is not expedient information
[15:48] it's not going to direct people
[15:50] necessarily to the message of the hour
[15:53] it can be the influence of a devil in a
[15:55] person's life and sometimes we as
[15:58] Believers can actually represent a false
[16:01] witness something that's not actually
[16:03] accurate according to the message of the
[16:05] hour
[16:08] it's interesting
[16:10] a lot of the stuff that we see it's very
[16:12] interesting
[16:13] we can see a lot of interesting things a
[16:15] lot of interesting events unfolding
[16:17] around us
[16:18] you know I I if we want to say we're
[16:21] looking for a sign we want to see that
[16:23] there's a sign
[16:24] we know that there is a discussion
[16:25] around the message of the hour that
[16:27] Billy Paul said his daddy said that you
[16:30] know by the time you're an old man
[16:32] sharks will be swimming in in this
[16:34] building
[16:35] and I believe it was the May building
[16:39] and there's an actual documented article
[16:42] that's on the internet now that says
[16:44] that there was an earthquake and I think
[16:46] it was in 1980 or maybe even earlier
[16:49] there was an earthquake that happened
[16:51] and water from the ocean got in
[16:54] and a shark or two was actually swimming
[16:57] in the basement of that building that
[16:59] very building that brother Branham said
[17:00] that about
[17:02] what my point is is if we're waiting for
[17:04] a cataclysmic California slipping into
[17:07] the ocean because that building is going
[17:08] to have sharks swimming in the basement
[17:10] of it according to the oral tradition
[17:12] that was shared with brother Branham to
[17:14] his son to all the other people that
[17:15] actually caught wind of it and heard it
[17:17] if we're looking for that sort of a sign
[17:20] it's already happened
[17:24] if we're looking for the coming of the
[17:26] Lord brothers and sisters
[17:29] something happened on Sunset mountain in
[17:31] 1963.
[17:33] and I don't really want to get into that
[17:35] too far tonight but what I do want to
[17:37] get into is just being careful about
[17:38] what we're sharing to one another
[17:41] we should share the word we should share
[17:43] the message of the hour I mean there's
[17:45] events that happen in this world and
[17:46] sometimes they're staggering to look at
[17:48] and many times if we don't actually go
[17:51] and seek it out we might not see it if
[17:54] we don't check the news regularly if
[17:56] we're not constantly scouting the news
[17:58] looking for an earthquake or looking for
[18:00] some sort of a world event which is what
[18:02] I've been guilty of doing
[18:04] and I'm just talking about myself here
[18:06] but because of that we can open
[18:09] ourselves up to a plethora of things
[18:12] that don't help us that distract us from
[18:15] the word that take us away from the main
[18:18] focus at hand and that should be winning
[18:20] Souls
[18:21] saving people taking as many people with
[18:24] us as we can
[18:27] but now especially with the age of
[18:28] Technology it's so easy to send things
[18:30] it's so easy to receive things and you
[18:33] know what the things that we receive are
[18:35] not always the things that we should
[18:36] send and I just want to leave it at that
[18:39] we need to be very careful about the
[18:41] things that we send because they might
[18:42] send the wrong message and maybe the
[18:45] most most of the people that we talk to
[18:46] and hang out with could be just fine but
[18:49] what if I forwarded something myself
[18:50] that actually came from Brother Barry
[18:53] and somebody knows that whatever he's a
[18:55] affiliated with a church or a pastor or
[18:57] some position in a church and it wasn't
[18:58] really expedient about the message of
[19:00] the hour I could actually potentially
[19:03] steer someone away
[19:05] from really understanding what I believe
[19:07] just by what I forwarded and it's like
[19:09] two clicks
[19:11] right maybe three we just want to be
[19:14] careful
[19:15] don't seek a sign
[19:16] the greatest sign that we could ever
[19:18] have has been given and that sign is the
[19:20] opening of the word that sign is the
[19:22] sign that was given to the prophet Jonas
[19:24] the discernment of Hearts it was given
[19:26] to Abraham the Discerning of Hearts
[19:29] understanding that you know the son of
[19:32] man Ministry is on Earth again it's here
[19:34] and and and it's going soon very soon
[19:38] I did share something
[19:40] now I'm going to say what I did share
[19:43] and if anybody's interested I could
[19:44] actually share it to you it's it's a
[19:47] video clip from from the brother I'll
[19:49] call him a brother the Messianic Jew
[19:51] that I know in Israel I've met him
[19:54] online and he sends updates regularly
[19:57] like every other every day or every
[19:59] other day
[20:01] is is his name online but he sent a
[20:04] video clip of them singing in front of
[20:07] the Wailing Wall and when you hear the
[20:10] entire Voice come together as one
[20:15] can you not imagine what that sounds
[20:17] like Before the Throne of God to think
[20:19] that there are people now in Israel
[20:23] coming together as one
[20:25] and you know how does the Lord deal with
[20:27] Israel
[20:29] he deals with them
[20:31] as a nation as one
[20:33] and the Gentiles he deals with as
[20:35] individuals
[20:37] but to just stand and or sit or however
[20:39] you want and and see that video and hear
[20:42] the sound of that singing it sounds like
[20:44] one
[20:45] with a tremendous voice all together
[20:47] before the Wailing Wall coming together
[20:49] with one Unity of spirit to think
[20:52] brothers and sisters the anointing is
[20:54] raising their and the anointing is
[20:56] leaving here and it's just going to be
[20:59] like that the secret silent going away
[21:01] of the Bride catching away of the Bride
[21:04] is not going to be the big cataclysmic
[21:06] events don't think that we're going to
[21:07] see something and that's going to
[21:08] trigger us to behave a different way and
[21:10] then we're going to get right with God
[21:11] and get to church and go to communion
[21:12] and do whatever we need to do if that's
[21:14] what we're going to do we're going to
[21:15] miss it
[21:16] it's going to just go like a thief in
[21:18] the night just like the scripture said
[21:22] you know the end of this year verse 31
[21:25] of this story about Lazarus and the rich
[21:27] man
[21:28] and he said unto him if they hear not
[21:30] Moses and the prophets if we don't hear
[21:33] the prophet today if we don't hear the
[21:35] pastors that preach the message of the
[21:37] hour if we're too busy getting hung up
[21:39] on the pastors of the message of the
[21:40] hour and saying well that Pastor he
[21:42] drives the Cadillac and that Pastor well
[21:44] he's just got a nice suit and that
[21:46] Pastor he's he's just got a house that
[21:48] nobody should have how could people have
[21:50] that kind of money brothers and sisters
[21:52] were just completely missing the point
[21:53] we're letting the devil hang one on us
[21:55] we should be separating ourselves from
[21:57] that we should be well beyond all of
[21:59] that as mature Christians
[22:02] understanding which that that which is
[22:05] perfect has come
[22:06] and we have the ability to partake of it
[22:08] we should be looking to Christ and
[22:11] saying you know what maybe that brother
[22:12] he's got way more money than I'll ever
[22:14] have but that's only because God could
[22:16] trust him with it and maybe he couldn't
[22:17] trust me with it maybe it would be
[22:19] enough to actually send me to hell just
[22:21] like that Rich Young Ruler where I
[22:22] wouldn't be able to let go of it all and
[22:24] and and say that you know just like we
[22:26] read this morning I believe it was in
[22:28] Matthew the same story from a different
[22:30] perspective a different account
[22:32] he was perfect in all of his ways and
[22:34] Jesus loved him when he saw him and he
[22:36] said you know if you want to just be
[22:37] perfect just do the one thing just get
[22:39] rid of all of it throw away your
[22:41] Traditions throw away your family
[22:43] inheritance throw away all the money
[22:45] that you've got and just give it to the
[22:46] poor and come and follow me how many
[22:48] people today would do that
[22:50] even if they met Jesus Christ in flesh
[22:52] and he told them to do that
[22:55] how many people would do that oh I don't
[22:58] know
[22:58] it would be challenging
[23:00] because as as people we're taught that
[23:02] we have to provide for our families as
[23:04] men we're worse than an Infidel if we
[23:07] don't provide for our families
[23:09] but to have a man tell us just throw it
[23:11] all away throw in the garbage just give
[23:12] it to the poor they need it
[23:14] and come and follow me
[23:17] you know that's exactly according to the
[23:19] scripture though seek ye first the
[23:21] kingdom of God
[23:22] and he'll add all the rest unto us all
[23:25] the rest of it unto us
[23:27] and you know we we were talking about it
[23:29] I think this morning about it being more
[23:31] than just finances more than just money
[23:33] more than just the the The Riches of
[23:36] this world
[23:37] it's the tradition
[23:39] forget about what you think you know and
[23:42] how perfect you are in all of your ways
[23:43] and all the all the Pharisee training
[23:46] that you've had and all the doctrines
[23:48] that's been given to you you might be
[23:49] perfect in the law be not perfect in my
[23:52] eyes is what Jesus said you've got
[23:54] something major holding you back
[23:56] but if you want to be perfect just get
[23:58] rid of it and you know that's the point
[23:59] that I wanted to get to kind of the
[24:01] punch line we need to forget about all
[24:03] the traditional teaching that we have
[24:04] all of the things that we think we know
[24:06] if we bring them and drag them over into
[24:08] the message of the hour and think that
[24:09] we're going to get the right results
[24:10] we're not going to get the right results
[24:12] those those are a little bit of Leaven
[24:15] is what the scripture says and a little
[24:17] bit of Leaven does what
[24:19] it leavens the whole lump it might not
[24:21] happen right away it might just be a
[24:24] little bit but it just takes a teeny
[24:26] little bit a speck of it one Spore of it
[24:29] to get in there and it just takes time
[24:31] it might be a day it might be a week it
[24:33] might be a month it might be a year it
[24:35] might be a decade
[24:37] but it'll happen eventually it'll just
[24:39] grow and take over
[24:41] and the cares of this life will become
[24:42] more important
[24:44] that's why brothers and sisters just a
[24:46] free side note
[24:48] it is vital it's not just important it
[24:52] is absolutely
[24:54] earth-shatteringly vital
[24:56] not only to make sure that you get the
[24:58] Holy Ghost but if you're looking for a
[25:00] mate
[25:01] they need to have the Holy Ghost
[25:03] that has got to be the pair amount
[25:05] factor in the equation
[25:08] you both need the holy ghost or do not
[25:11] get married
[25:12] it will not work you will not take a
[25:14] person who does not have the Holy Ghost
[25:16] and then train them into getting the
[25:18] holy ghost that will not work the person
[25:21] without the Holy Ghost will drag you all
[25:23] the way out into the world
[25:26] and tear your life apart and you'll have
[25:28] a situation where you'll think I wish
[25:30] that we would have had the Holy Ghost
[25:31] now I've got all this wreckage behind me
[25:33] children maybe that are upset a divorce
[25:36] on the go and now I have to drag my butt
[25:39] all the way back to church and try and
[25:41] face everyone when they tried to tell me
[25:43] this from the beginning
[25:45] but I'll tell you what as long as I'm
[25:47] around
[25:48] I'll say hey welcome
[25:52] I will never tell you so
[25:54] you know people don't need to hear that
[25:56] every single time in fact people don't
[26:00] need to hear I told you so
[26:01] but isn't it an interesting thing how
[26:03] human nature is
[26:05] people just want to tell people I told
[26:06] you so I told you that didn't I tell you
[26:09] that would happen
[26:10] parents classic statement to the
[26:13] children I told you that would happen
[26:16] we don't want to do that especially when
[26:18] it comes to the house of God especially
[26:19] when it comes to the gospel we want to
[26:21] welcome people we want to bring people
[26:22] to the Lord you know what sometimes
[26:25] people I'll say this maybe sometimes
[26:27] people they need to go and go through
[26:29] all of that wreckage in their lives to
[26:31] get to the place where God can actually
[26:32] put the Holy Ghost in them
[26:34] if they're a son and daughter of God
[26:36] we've heard it said sometimes God will
[26:38] pull you through the knot hole sideways
[26:40] but you'll come
[26:43] some people come easy some people come
[26:45] hard
[26:47] anyways if we can't hear the prophets
[26:50] just like this Rich Young Ruler we're
[26:52] not going to hear someone that comes
[26:54] back from the grave we're not going to
[26:56] hear someone that will actually come and
[26:57] tell us to just forget about all of your
[26:59] stuff and just sell it and and give it
[27:01] to the poor and then you know God will
[27:03] bless you
[27:05] it's going to be irrelevant if we can't
[27:06] hear the voice of a prophet
[27:09] you know don't seek assigned brothers
[27:10] and sisters we've been given the way
[27:13] we've been given the word for a reason
[27:14] and and that reason is so that we could
[27:17] receive the Holy Ghost as we've said
[27:18] this morning there's nothing more
[27:20] important to talk about than the Holy
[27:22] Ghost than getting the token in our
[27:23] lives we can talk about all the Deep
[27:25] Mysteries and the seals and and the
[27:27] Seven Church ages and the Seven unknown
[27:29] Thunders and all the Mysteries that were
[27:31] contained in those seven unknown
[27:33] Thunders and all the stuff the 70 weeks
[27:35] of Daniel we can get into all of the
[27:37] doctrinal things that we understand that
[27:39] are are really deep mysterious things in
[27:42] terms of the message but if you don't
[27:43] have the Holy Ghost
[27:45] it's just theology
[27:47] it's just an action of learning and
[27:49] being able to retain information and
[27:52] then being able to give it out and
[27:53] typically what happens if people don't
[27:55] have the Holy Ghost they want to spar
[27:57] with it they want to say I know more
[27:58] than you and I I'll go quote to quote
[28:01] with you man you know what good is that
[28:04] it's got nothing to do with the message
[28:05] of the hour it's got nothing to do with
[28:07] Christ
[28:08] we we said it this morning if you don't
[28:10] have charity in your life if you don't
[28:12] have Divine love if you don't have the
[28:14] Holy Ghost it's all for nothing
[28:16] no matter how much we give to the poor
[28:18] no matter how much we do
[28:20] we've been given the open word in our
[28:22] day we've been given the absolute
[28:24] ultimate sign for our day and it's not
[28:27] the cloud necessarily
[28:29] and it's not William Branham necessarily
[28:31] and it's not the message necessarily and
[28:35] it's not the church that we would attend
[28:36] that would claim to preach the message
[28:38] necessarily
[28:40] all of that combined but what it is the
[28:44] super sign brothers and sisters we've
[28:45] all heard it I know it is you
[28:48] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[28:50] the super sign you we are living witness
[28:54] of the message of the hour that Christ
[28:56] has Grace for this age too
[28:59] and we have the ability to show that to
[29:02] people to impart that Christ still has
[29:05] Grace but you know what time is running
[29:07] out that clock is ticking and and you
[29:10] know we've heard it said many times it's
[29:12] it's how many minutes to midnight on the
[29:15] atomic clock
[29:16] how many minutes to midnight how many
[29:18] seconds now I would say to midnight is
[29:21] it how many people can we bring to
[29:23] heaven with us I want to throw that
[29:25] challenge out there how many people can
[29:26] we share the message of the hour with
[29:28] how many people can we witness to and
[29:30] and and get to come to see the message
[29:33] of the hour some people might come
[29:35] because they're excited because of our
[29:36] excitement some people might come
[29:38] because they think that we're nice
[29:39] people some people might come because
[29:41] they see just a blessing around being
[29:43] with a good group of people but there's
[29:46] others that might come because they want
[29:47] the true token they want the Holy Ghost
[29:49] and those are the ones that were after
[29:51] brothers and sisters
[29:53] but you know we're after them all
[29:55] because we can give people the
[29:57] opportunity to see eternal life just on
[29:59] the way they treat us
[30:02] so we have the ability to actually give
[30:04] them the opportunity
[30:06] to be nice to us
[30:08] so if someone asks you if you want a
[30:10] glass of water take it
[30:13] because even a cup of cold water
[30:15] will be remembered on the other side
[30:17] we've been given the greatest sign ever
[30:19] we've been given the sign that we were
[30:21] able to receive the spirit of adoption
[30:23] that we might be able to receive the
[30:25] spirit of Truth
[30:27] that we might be able to receive the
[30:29] Holy Ghost
[30:31] and if we've received the Holy Ghost
[30:32] brothers and sisters it's not optional
[30:35] this is so it's just I believe this is
[30:38] so critical
[30:39] it's not optional this part is not
[30:41] optional I think sometimes it's almost
[30:42] implied like it is or it's maybe just
[30:44] not preached this way I don't know maybe
[30:46] it's just me in my my weird way but I
[30:49] don't believe
[30:51] ghost and and to not have the mind of
[30:54] Christ
[30:55] to know what to do with the word
[30:58] we have a maturing process
[31:00] but if we have the Holy Ghost then we
[31:02] have the mind of Christ it's no longer
[31:05] us thinking
[31:07] it's him thinking in US
[31:09] and I think it's a an astounding thought
[31:11] really to think about but it's true how
[31:14] could we have
[31:16] the Holy Ghost how could we have the
[31:18] Holy Spirit how could we
[31:20] be adopted Sons and Daughters of God and
[31:22] not have his mind
[31:23] in us I just don't think it's possible
[31:27] I do believe that's where brother
[31:28] Branham said that very few people will
[31:30] go on to the true baptism of the Holy
[31:32] Spirit
[31:33] it's just a staggering thought to think
[31:36] about but I believe
[31:38] it's encouraging too
[31:40] because that's what every one of us
[31:41] wants and I don't think that there's
[31:43] anybody here or in the parking lot
[31:44] tonight or anyone else that Tunes in
[31:46] that listens to us perhaps who is a
[31:49] member of this congregation a member of
[31:51] the mystical body of Jesus Christ who
[31:53] doesn't have the Holy Ghost I would that
[31:55] everyone would
[31:57] I think that somebody with the Holy
[31:59] Ghost will always treat everyone as
[32:01] though they do
[32:03] we're not going to go around and try and
[32:05] slam people and treat them like they
[32:06] don't that's that's that's an antichrist
[32:08] spirit I would not accept that that's
[32:10] that's not right we want everyone to go
[32:13] on to see that blessing in their lives
[32:16] but you know he's given us the mind of
[32:17] Christ if we have the Holy Spirit in our
[32:19] lives that we would know what to do with
[32:21] the word
[32:23] because we've been given the prophet who
[32:25] actually showed us the word is open
[32:28] it's a completely open word to us we
[32:30] don't have to to walk on pins and
[32:32] needles we don't have to have a big long
[32:34] prayer meeting because something has
[32:36] happened in our lives
[32:37] back in Moses day
[32:40] we know that Jesus told them speak the
[32:41] word and go forward why are you talking
[32:42] to me why why cry speak
[32:45] we've had the Prophet come and and open
[32:47] the word be used to open the word to us
[32:51] but sometimes I feel like it it almost
[32:53] seems like we need to go backwards and
[32:55] and and and cry instead of just speak
[32:57] the word because we have the mind of
[32:59] Christ
[33:02] we don't want to do that
[33:04] don't say
[33:05] When I See This or when I see that then
[33:09] I'll act
[33:10] because if we do that brothers and
[33:11] sisters we're going to miss it and I
[33:13] would say
[33:15] potentially we've already missed it if
[33:17] we're saying that today
[33:19] potentially we've already missed it
[33:23] we've been we've been given so much in
[33:26] our day
[33:27] you know I I feel like I could just keep
[33:29] going on and on and on and on and I
[33:31] could and I'm not going to tonight
[33:34] I just wanted to just try and encourage
[33:36] each one of us to be very cautious what
[33:38] we pass around don't look for a sign
[33:41] don't think that we're going to do
[33:43] something different when we see
[33:44] something else because I've said it
[33:46] before and I'll say it again this and
[33:49] and maybe not this
[33:50] right here the amount of people in here
[33:53] but this what we have are lives that
[33:56] we've met all of the brothers and
[33:57] sisters who've come from all the
[33:58] different countries in the world and we
[34:00] we gather together around the message of
[34:01] the hour brothers and sisters this is it
[34:03] man
[34:05] we're not going to see a great move it's
[34:06] not going to be a great Revival maybe
[34:09] there'll be more people that come to the
[34:10] church who knows maybe there will be
[34:12] another church building maybe this will
[34:14] grow maybe there will be other Church
[34:15] buildings in the City of Calgary if the
[34:17] Lord should who knows what what could
[34:19] potentially happen if the Lord should
[34:21] tarry but there isn't going to be a
[34:23] great message Revival happen in this
[34:25] world
[34:26] that's happened that ship has sailed
[34:28] it's gone the only thing left the
[34:30] prophet said that he sees for the
[34:32] Gentile church is the rapture of the
[34:36] so we just want to make sure that we
[34:38] have oil in our lamps the shout's
[34:39] already gone forth behold the bridegroom
[34:41] cometh rise and trim your lamps that's
[34:45] already happened brothers and sisters
[34:46] it's history now
[34:48] now there's people out there looking for
[34:50] oil but they won't receive it when you
[34:52] tell them if you come according to the
[34:54] message of Malachi 4 if you come
[34:56] according to
[34:58] if you come according to Revelations 10
[35:00] 7 you have the opportunity to receive
[35:03] the Holy Ghost you have the opportunity
[35:05] to get oil in your lap and still trim it
[35:07] while there's time
[35:08] many times people just don't want to
[35:10] hear it because they've got their
[35:11] tradition
[35:12] and you know what they're going to wind
[35:13] up just like that Rich Young Ruler
[35:16] we don't want to be that that guy
[35:19] tonight I just want to thank everyone
[35:21] for making the effort to come out I know
[35:23] this is weird
[35:25] and this is like I said the years for
[35:28] weird
[35:29] 2020 2021 it doesn't look like there's
[35:32] any let up in sight it looks like it's
[35:34] getting worse and there's going to be
[35:35] more clampdowns and restrictions or
[35:38] whatever we don't know what's going to
[35:39] happen nobody knows
[35:41] it was just last week I was talking to a
[35:43] brother maybe a week before he was
[35:46] telling me how good it was in another
[35:47] province that everything is open and
[35:49] it's too bad you guys are all closed and
[35:51] now this week a week later now they're
[35:53] closed too
[35:54] we
[35:56] happen we have no idea the only thing
[35:58] that we know is there's a Rapture coming
[36:00] and the only thing that we know is that
[36:02] we have oil and the only thing that we
[36:04] know is that we can just continue on and
[36:06] the trajectory that we're at and we'll
[36:08] see the apostolic blessing in our lives
[36:10] we won't be left behind
[36:14] I thought I've been thinking about this
[36:16] recently isn't it interesting I'm just
[36:18] going to throw this out there and then
[36:19] maybe I'll ask sister Emily to come
[36:21] will close in a word of prayer and just
[36:23] change the order of the service here
[36:25] I just was thinking about it isn't it
[36:27] interesting
[36:28] and and and and it's probably absolutely
[36:30] nothing it's just me pondering but you
[36:33] get my thoughts for free
[36:36] um it's interesting that there's only 12
[36:39] people allowed in this building
[36:45] yeah yeah actually I plan on that
[36:47] brother
[36:48] 100 percent
[36:50] yeah it's interesting just to see the
[36:52] the the the numbers and
[36:55] I I don't know maybe it's just me
[36:58] I can be a little weird that way maybe
[37:01] stand with me tonight as we do change
[37:02] the order of the service
[37:04] let's just go to him in prayer gracious
[37:07] Heavenly Father Lord we're just so
[37:09] thankful for your grace
[37:11] and we're thankful for your mercy
[37:14] we're thankful for each and every life
[37:16] that's represented here tonight Lord
[37:18] Jesus
[37:20] father in in fact for me it's humbling
[37:24] [Music]
[37:25] week after week we look at the
[37:28] the chairs being empty here father and
[37:32] don't really know where everything
[37:34] stands but
[37:35] we know that it is all in your control
[37:38] it has been all along and it will be
[37:41] until the end
[37:43] and father I pray that tonight you would
[37:46] just
[37:47] pour out a special blessing upon your
[37:49] children father
[37:50] each and every one who has made the
[37:52] effort to come out I pray that this
[37:54] service would be a special service Lord
[37:56] we've gone over a year trying to abide
[37:59] by the laws and trying to find our way
[38:01] and figure out the new normal and Lord
[38:04] we just we just have to try something we
[38:07] have to make an effort and and here we
[38:09] are and Lord I would pray that you would
[38:11] forgive me if I have been a hindrance to
[38:14] allowing this to happen
[38:16] but father all's we can do is is go
[38:18] forwards now
[38:20] so I pray that Lord you would just be
[38:23] pleased with this part of our service
[38:25] now
[38:26] that you would just bless each and every
[38:28] one as we come through
[38:30] we just ask all these things in Jesus
[38:33] Christ's name
[38:34] amen
[38:37] so we have uh
[38:40] a bit of a process that we're going to
[38:42] do Brothers how many people can we bring
[38:44] in
[38:44] [Music]
[38:49] okay
[38:51] [Music]
[38:56] all right so the brothers are going to
[38:58] cue the people from the parking lot into
[39:01] the foyer and then from the foyer into
[39:03] the sanctuary
[39:06] and uh
[39:08] we will have two of the brothers come
[39:10] and serve the communion
[39:13] I believe it's brother Emmanuel and
[39:15] brother Toby is that right
[39:18] Brothers if you would come at this time
[39:22] the people who do come in will have you
[39:24] come in
[39:26] on the piano side
[39:28] up to the front
[39:30] partake of the bread
[39:33] then a glass of wine
[39:36] the deacons will serve you both of those
[39:38] if you just hold out your hand they'll
[39:40] give them to you
[39:41] please don't reach in to grab anything
[39:45] and once you've taken the wine you can
[39:47] deposit it in the waste basket by the
[39:49] door and just exit out the ramp
[39:53] I'm sorry we can't have a testimony
[39:55] service I'm sorry we can't have a foot
[39:57] washing I'm sorry we can't just sing our
[39:59] hearts out like we would
[40:03] but we'll try and make the best of it
[40:07] so God bless you tonight we'll just ask
[40:09] the brothers to
[40:13] bless the
[40:16] the supper here
[40:30] if you want to just
[40:33] break it while you pray
[40:35] I'll hold the mic
[40:39] I gotta set that down
[40:43] [Music]

[42:35] Christ the blood of your Covenant we

[43:16] Christ's number three amen
[43:29] thank you
[43:33] I'll just read the scripture as we
[43:35] commence with this
[43:37] in First Corinthians chapter 11.
[43:42] verse 23 for I have received of the Lord
[43:46] that which also I delivered unto you
[43:49] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[43:51] which he was betrayed took bread
[43:54] and when he had given thanks he break it
[43:56] and said take eat this is my body which
[43:59] is broken for you
[44:01] this do in remembrance of me
[44:05] after the same manner also he took the
[44:07] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[44:09] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[44:13] this do ye as often as he drink it in
[44:16] remembrance of me for as often as ye eat
[44:19] this bread and drink this cup
[44:22] you do shoe the Lord's death till he
[44:25] come
[44:26] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[44:29] and drink this cup of the Lord
[44:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[44:34] and the blood of the Lord
[44:37] but let a man examine himself and so let
[44:41] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[44:43] cup
[44:44] for he that eateth and drinketh
[44:46] unworthily Edith and drinketh Damnation
[44:49] to himself
[44:51] not Discerning the Lord's body
[44:54] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[44:57] among you and many sleep
[44:59] for if we would judge ourselves we
[45:01] should not be judged
[45:03] but when we are judged we are chastened
[45:06] of the Lord that we should not be
[45:08] condemned with the world
[45:10] wherefore my brethren when you come
[45:12] together to eat tarry one for another
[45:16] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[45:18] home
[45:19] that ye come not together unto
[45:21] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[45:24] order
[45:25] when I come let's just take one moment
[45:28] and tarry one for another
[45:30] and if there is anything that anybody
[45:32] has right now is an opportunity just
[45:34] take the time
[45:35] make it right
[45:38] we don't have to rush and there's no
[45:39] pressure
[45:42] [Music]
[45:50] gracious Lord Jesus
[45:53] now we've come to the highest order of
[45:55] this service and we pray that
[45:57] we could worthily just partake of your
[45:59] body
