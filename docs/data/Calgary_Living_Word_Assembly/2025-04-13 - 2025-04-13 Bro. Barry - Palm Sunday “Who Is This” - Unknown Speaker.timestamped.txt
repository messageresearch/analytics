[5:04] Lord, we pray that you move from person
[5:06] to person, Lord. Lord, answering their
[5:09] questions, answering their prayers, Lord
[5:11] Jesus Christ, giving them their heart's
[5:13] desire, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, above
[5:16] all, Lord, open our eyes, Lord, that we
[5:18] may see you, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord
[5:20] Jesus Christ, because no man can come
[5:22] unto you unless you call him, Lord Jesus
[5:25] Christ. Lord, it is a miracle, Lord, to
[5:28] believe in your word. It is a miracle,
[5:30] Lord, to be here, Lord Jesus Christ, and
[5:34] leave all other things that we can be
[5:35] doing on this day. Lord, we love you,
[5:38] Lord. We bless your holy name. Lord, we
[5:40] pray for the minister, Lord, this
[5:42] morning, Lord Jesus Christ. We just want
[5:44] to hear your mind, Lord Jesus Christ, as
[5:46] you speak to your bride. And Lord, we
[5:48] just dedicate, Lord, the song leader,
[5:51] the musicians, Lord Jesus Christ, as
[5:53] they create an atmosphere, Lord, for
[5:55] your word to be planted in our hearts.
[5:57] Lord, we love you, Lord. We bless your
[5:59] holy name. And also those who are
[6:01] watching online, Lord Jesus Christ, may
[6:03] they receive their portion. We ask all
[6:05] these things, Lord, in your wonderful
[6:07] name, Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[6:13] Amen. Thank you, brother. So, maybe
[6:15] shake someone's hand as you're seated.
[6:17] Visitors, friends, brothers and sisters

[18:55] Father. You showed us great mercy.
[18:59] We stand here today, Father, because of
[19:01] thy longsuffering, thy kindness, thy
[19:03] mercy, thy grace. Lord,
[19:06] many times, Father, we ask, why? Why me,

[20:01] stumbling block to anyone.
[20:04] Yes,

[26:17] morning. Welcome to the house of the
[26:18] Lord. If you have a need this morning,
[26:20] maybe just make it known unto
[26:23] him as we go to him in prayer. Gracious
[26:26] heavenly father, Lord Jesus, you are the
[26:29] lover of our soul. We're so thankful
[26:31] that we can sing this song, Lord Jesus,
[26:34] with assurance, Lord, knowing that even
[26:37] though as we've already heard our
[26:39] brother pray, we have faults and
[26:41] shortcomings, but Lord Jesus, our desire
[26:44] is that you would be the master over all
[26:47] of our lives, Lord. Over every single
[26:50] decision that we make, Lord, out of
[26:52] every single action that would happen in
[26:54] our lives, Lord. every single word that
[26:56] would come out of our mouth, Lord Jesus,
[26:59] that you would be the Lord over it all.
[27:03] Oh, Father, not just
[27:05] compartmentamentalize you and say when
[27:08] we go to church or maybe when we're in
[27:10] prayer or maybe when we're around other
[27:12] believers, but Lord, when we're alone,
[27:15] Father, when no one else can see but
[27:17] you, Lord Jesus. Oh father, let the
[27:21] meditation of our hearts Lord and the
[27:25] thoughts and the words on our lips Lord
[27:27] Jesus be pleasing unto you.
[27:30] Father, be the Lord of our lives. Oh
[27:34] Father, help us not to have any
[27:36] reservations. Lord, help us to cast down
[27:39] every single imagination. Lord, all of
[27:41] those traditions, all of those former
[27:43] teachings that would try and exalt
[27:45] themselves against you today, Lord.
[27:48] Father, and give you the preeminence,
[27:50] Lord, that one who has risen 2,000 years
[27:53] ago here in Calgary in our lives.
[27:56] Father, be our
[27:59] Lord. Father, as we go forward, we just
[28:02] want to remember the needs, Lord, that
[28:04] were made known unto you by way of an
[28:06] uplift hand. We know that you're more
[28:08] than able. Father, we want to stand with
[28:10] brother Johnny
[28:11] Hucklech. Father, trusting you, Father.
[28:15] all of the unspoken requests, Lord
[28:17] Jesus. We bring them to you, Father, and
[28:19] thank you for meeting their needs, Lord,
[28:21] according to your riches in Christ
[28:23] Jesus, according to your glory, your
[28:26] plan. We know that you're able to work
[28:28] them out and that you are even right
[28:30] now. Father, we just want to ask, Lord
[28:33] Jesus, if there's anybody here today
[28:36] that doesn't know you in the power of
[28:38] your resurrection, Lord, that you would
[28:40] just reveal yourself to them, Father.
[28:42] And Lord, if anybody here needs a
[28:44] refilling of your spirit, Lord, oh
[28:46] father, grant it to them in the name of
[28:48] Jesus.
[28:50] Lord
[28:52] God, we love you and we thank you for
[28:54] your goodness to us.
[28:57] You're so good to us,
[28:59] Lord. We just commit this service now
[29:02] into your hands for your glory. In Jesus
[29:05] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[29:09] Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[29:12] [Music]
[29:14] My if you have your Bibles this
[29:17] morning like to read from
[29:19] Matthew chapter
[29:28] 21. Matthew chapter
[29:36] 21 start with verse one.
[29:44] And when they drew nigh unto
[29:48] Jerusalem, and were come to Bethage unto
[29:51] the Mount of
[29:53] Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
[29:57] saying unto them, Go into the village
[30:00] over against you, and straightway ye
[30:03] shall find an ass tied and a colt with
[30:06] her. loose them and bring them unto
[30:11] me. And if any man say ought unto you,
[30:14] ye shall say, The Lord hath need of
[30:18] them, and straightway he will send them.
[30:22] All this was done that it might be
[30:24] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[30:27] prophet
[30:28] saying, "Tell ye the daughter of Zion,
[30:32] Behold, the king cometh unto thee meek
[30:35] and sitting upon an ass, the colt of a
[30:39] full of an ass."
[30:43] And the disciples went and did as Jesus
[30:46] commanded
[30:47] them, and brought the ass and the colt,
[30:52] and put on them their clothes, and they
[30:55] set him
[30:58] thereon. And a very great multitude
[31:01] spread their garments in the way. Others
[31:04] cut down branches from the trees, and
[31:06] strod them in the way. And the
[31:09] multitudes that went before and that
[31:13] followed cried, saying, "Hosana to the
[31:16] son of
[31:17] David, blessed is he that cometh in the
[31:21] name of the Lord.
[31:23] Hosana in the
[31:25] highest." And when he was come to
[31:29] Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
[31:32] saying, "Who is this?" Amen.
[31:37] And the multitude said, "This is Jesus,
[31:41] the prophet of Nazareth of
[31:45] Galilee." Let's just bow in prayer one
[31:48] more
[31:49] time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[31:52] thank you for your
[31:53] word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that this
[31:56] many years later after this actually
[32:00] took place, we can be here and
[32:03] acknowledge it, Lord.
[32:05] We can be here and we can read these
[32:07] words by revelation, Lord
[32:10] Jesus. And Lord, we know that many
[32:12] people in the day in which we
[32:14] live, in the day in which you walked on
[32:17] the
[32:18] earth say and said, "Who is
[32:22] this?" But father, you have revealed
[32:26] yourself very greatly, Lord. And we
[32:29] thank you for that. We just ask Lord
[32:31] that you would bless the reading of your
[32:32] word, that you would bless all that's
[32:34] spoken, Father, all that's thought, all
[32:37] that we do today, Lord, that it would
[32:39] just bring glory unto you. We just
[32:42] commit this service into your hands now
[32:43] for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name
[32:45] we pray. Amen. God bless you this
[32:48] morning. You may be
[32:51] seated. Certainly thankful to be back
[32:54] together again in the house of the Lord
[32:57] and uh certainly like to welcome all of
[32:59] our visitors.
[33:00] As we have so many in our midst from
[33:03] near and far, it's wonderful to see
[33:06] everyone. It's just wonderful to get
[33:08] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:10] because we know the word says that where
[33:11] two or three are gathered together in
[33:13] his name that he's there. So any one of
[33:16] us that have any need there's nothing
[33:18] here that he is not able to meet.
[33:21] There's no problem too complex that he
[33:24] can't solve. There's no issue that he
[33:27] can't bring better results for us in our
[33:30] lives. Today we're observing the whole
[33:34] entire world is Palm Sunday. Whether
[33:38] people want to or not, it is the day in
[33:40] which we are experiencing. It's the
[33:43] Sunday
[33:45] before my Easter. And uh it's just a
[33:50] wonderful time to look at this scripture
[33:52] and and to realize what's actually
[33:54] taking place here. Many times the story
[33:56] is told in such a way that it's maybe
[33:58] like a Sunday school story and that you
[34:01] know there was a a fo of an ass a junior
[34:04] horse and and Jesus was able to be
[34:06] placed upon it and they had palm leaves
[34:09] and they gave reverence and they they
[34:11] honored Jesus as he came into the city
[34:13] but they didn't understand what was
[34:16] actually taking place at that time. And
[34:19] all of the city was moved is what the
[34:21] Bible said here. What a tremendous
[34:23] thought that is. All of the city was
[34:26] moved. And what did they say? Who is
[34:28] this?
[34:30] Why is the city so stirred up? What's
[34:32] the what's the attraction on the what's
[34:35] going on? Why do we have such a great
[34:38] stirring in the
[34:41] city? And it was Jesus.
[34:44] And I think it's so beautiful. My
[34:46] inspiration for today's
[34:49] uh today's message, today's gathering is
[34:53] from the message who is this in 1959 I
[34:57] believe brother Brandham preached it and
[34:59] it's just such a I think maybe some
[35:02] would call it such a simple message.
[35:05] Such a simple message but you know the
[35:07] deepest things are the most simple.
[35:10] That's the way God works. That's why
[35:12] before the seals were preached, it
[35:15] wasn't brother Brandham that opened
[35:16] them. It was the angel of the Lord that
[35:18] opened those seals and revealed them to
[35:19] him. And he was the conduit in which God
[35:21] used to express that to this world. But
[35:24] he preached a sermon called God hiding
[35:29] himself in simplicity
[35:32] but revealing himself in the same.
[35:37] Many times people want a great
[35:40] theology, great
[35:42] theologians, great ministries that have
[35:46] been around and are well seasoned and
[35:48] have the ability to actually maybe
[35:52] endure with things in the church. But
[35:55] you know, God will use a child. And if
[35:59] we have any questions about that, he
[36:00] said when the children came to him and
[36:02] the disciples were like, "No, get those
[36:03] snotty those little kids away from him.
[36:05] Don't let them come near him. He's the
[36:07] master. What did he say? He picked one
[36:09] up and put them up in his lap and said,
[36:11] "Unless you're willing to come as one of
[36:13] these, you're not in any way going to
[36:15] see the kingdom of God."
[36:18] So, I think it it really behooves us to
[36:22] make sure that we're not looking for
[36:23] something that we don't already have.
[36:26] God will use exactly what he chooses to
[36:29] use. And you know, many times we'll pray
[36:32] and pray and pray for an answer to our
[36:34] prayers, and God will give us the
[36:36] answer, and we'll still be praying for
[36:38] another answer even though he's given us
[36:40] an
[36:41] answer. What does that do for our
[36:44] relationship to him? What would it be
[36:46] like to be a parent and have a child
[36:48] say, "I would really like to have this
[36:50] from you, mommy or daddy. Can you do
[36:52] this? Can you meet this need for me in
[36:53] my life?" And you give it to them and
[36:55] they say, "No, mommy, can you meet this
[36:56] need in my life? Can you please meet
[36:58] this need in my life?" And you say,
[37:00] "Junior, I I already met that need in
[37:02] your life. You have it in your hand.
[37:04] It's right there. But I don't like this
[37:06] one. I want something else." What does
[37:09] that do? It's not
[37:14] good. Celebrating Palm
[37:17] Sunday, observing Palm Sunday, it's such
[37:21] a wonderful time. The whole world is a
[37:24] buzz. The whole world is energized. and
[37:28] not so much with Palm Sunday, but the
[37:31] whole world. I'm jumping ahead of myself
[37:33] and I'm just going to continue down this
[37:34] path. I hope it's okay. Today, I don't
[37:36] really have a lot of quotes,
[37:37] fortunately, for the people that don't
[37:38] like quoting, but the people who do, I'm
[37:41] sorry, I only have one or maybe two that
[37:44] I'm going to bring, but one that I
[37:45] actually sent the sound booth and it's
[37:46] real simple today. It's not going to be
[37:48] really complex, but I do feel inspired.
[37:51] I feel energized. I I feel electrified.
[37:53] I feel like preaching today. I don't
[37:55] feel like just having an ordinary
[37:56] service, just a traditional gathering of
[37:59] of brothers and sisters of like precious
[38:01] faith. If we didn't come here to
[38:03] actually hear from our theophanes, then
[38:05] why on earth did we come to church?
[38:08] Why do we go to church? Is it a
[38:10] tradition? If it's just a tradition,
[38:12] brothers and sisters, I want to tell you
[38:14] that will take you to the tribulation.
[38:18] But when we come to meet with God
[38:20] Almighty, when we come to give him honor
[38:22] and reverence according to him being the
[38:24] Lord over our lives, over every single
[38:27] thought and every single word, every
[38:29] single decision that we make, then
[38:32] something's going to happen. Brother
[38:34] Bradom, I'm going to read this quote
[38:36] here before we get going too far. I I've
[38:38] got I got some notes, but it's out of
[38:42] 19590510E. Who is this? The whole city
[38:45] is moved. The whole city is stirred
[38:48] wondering what's going on. Who is this?
[38:51] Brother, he says, "Oh, that night down
[38:55] yonder." Now, I I love how the prophet
[38:58] does this. He just talks about his
[39:00] experience. He doesn't bring a
[39:01] theological textbook ideology to the
[39:04] people to say this is how we ought to
[39:07] be. What he says is this is what
[39:09] happened to me. This is how my fire got
[39:10] lit. And he said, "If we don't have
[39:12] anything else to talk about in this
[39:13] world, if we can't remember the seals,
[39:15] if we can't remember revelations, if we
[39:17] can't remember the book of Hebrews or
[39:19] adoption series, any of that stuff, just
[39:21] tell how it got lit."
[39:24] After all, we're here to get people to
[39:25] Jesus Christ. And as soon as we forget
[39:28] that, I believe we need to get back to
[39:30] the altar, grab a hold of the horns of
[39:33] the altar, and say, "Lord, forgive me
[39:35] because I've lost my focus." But brother
[39:37] Bradom, he says this, talking about his
[39:39] experience. So that night down yonder, I
[39:41] might forget my age. I might even forget
[39:43] my name sometime, but I can never forget
[39:46] that hour when he delivered me from sin.
[39:52] If any of us ever comes to the place
[39:54] where we forget that hour, where we
[39:57] forget that time where we were able to
[39:59] have that real godly repentance in our
[40:02] lives, then we got a problem. We
[40:05] seriously have forgotten that our old
[40:07] sins have been purged from us.
[40:10] None of us, not one
[40:13] person has come without this redeeming
[40:17] power of Jesus Christ.
[40:20] I think it's so beautiful, you know,
[40:21] talking about godly repentance. The last
[40:24] phone call that we had, Lisa and I had,
[40:27] my wife, we spoke to Grandpa Clawson,
[40:31] Brother Pete
[40:33] Clawson, who's in glory
[40:36] now with his bride, with his daughter,
[40:40] with his
[40:41] grandson, with all the people that we
[40:44] love dearly. But the last conversation
[40:47] we had with him, we we just were able to
[40:49] talk freely and we said, you know, how
[40:51] did it happen? and how did you get
[40:53] saved? You know, who got saved first?
[40:55] And he expressed to us, he we talked to
[40:56] him for a while and he told us about how
[40:58] his wife got saved and and how the flame
[41:01] in her life, he was able to see God's
[41:04] transforming power in her life. And then
[41:07] he had this thing that just came over
[41:10] him and he called it godly sorrow, godly
[41:14] repentance. And he said it just was
[41:16] overwhelming. He couldn't escape it. And
[41:18] I just can't help but think that's the
[41:20] same thing for every single believer. We
[41:23] all have got to come to this experience.
[41:25] And I want to encourage us today,
[41:27] brothers and sisters. If we've forgotten
[41:29] this, ask God to remind us. If we've
[41:32] never experienced it, ask him that you
[41:35] can experience it. And he will show you.
[41:40] He even says it this way. It's like a
[41:42] woman giving birth.
[41:44] When women give birth, you don't forget
[41:47] that. And you know, all the brothers
[41:50] would understand this very clearly
[41:51] because when we talk about having pain
[41:53] in our lives and in our bodies, the
[41:56] women will always remind us there's
[41:58] nothing quite like child
[42:00] birth. We don't have to say very much
[42:02] and we get reminded of that. And you
[42:05] know, God allowed it to be that way. But
[42:08] he also gave them a a shot of a chemical
[42:11] right after they have their baby so that
[42:12] they can forget that pain. And that's
[42:14] scientifically proven.
[42:17] But it's uh it's an interesting thing.
[42:19] You just don't forget some things in
[42:21] life. And I believe God has given us the
[42:24] ability to have a God consciousness so
[42:26] that we will never forget him. But
[42:28] brother Brandham, he says, "Oh, that
[42:30] night down yonder, I might forget my
[42:32] age. I might even forget some my name
[42:34] sometime, but I can never forget that
[42:36] hour when he delivered me from my sin.
[42:39] Something took place down inside me that
[42:43] it's helped me through the great hours
[42:45] in darkness. The hour of my deliverance.
[42:49] The weights of sin left me and I was a
[42:52] new
[42:53] person. I've been a new creature in
[42:56] Christ Jesus ever since.
[42:58] Yes. And I just want to say to us,
[43:00] brothers and sisters, this is all about
[43:02] salvation. This is not about head
[43:04] knowledge. If if if someone's looking
[43:06] for theology and head knowledge and and
[43:08] and exposition of all of the different
[43:11] mysteries according to the word of God
[43:13] and the message of the hour, this is not
[43:15] the place. We're going to lead people to
[43:17] get to Jesus Christ because he is the
[43:20] teacher. He is the one who's going to
[43:22] bring the spirit of truth in our lives.
[43:25] Outside of the Holy Ghost, we're just
[43:26] reading text. Outside of the Holy Ghost,
[43:29] we're just good church members at
[43:32] best. Who wants to live in that realm?
[43:36] Every one of us need to be just like the
[43:39] disciples. Amen. Where we can look at
[43:41] people in this world and say, you know,
[43:43] silver and gold have I I don't have
[43:45] much, man. I don't have much I can give
[43:47] you, but what I've got, I am more than
[43:49] willing and able to give to you. And
[43:51] what that is is a shot at eternal life.
[43:54] If you want to know what makes me happy,
[43:57] I'll tell you the reason why I sing.
[43:59] It's because I know who my redeemer is.
[44:02] I know that he lives. And where does he
[44:04] live? He lives right here. You're
[44:07] looking at him. But we have the ability
[44:09] to bring restoration and healing to
[44:11] people's lives. Hope that people never
[44:14] have experienced before in this world.
[44:18] Brother Brandham said it and I'll
[44:20] continue to say it. We might be the only
[44:21] Jesus that people will ever see or
[44:23] experience in this world until they get
[44:26] to the white throne judgment. They'll be
[44:28] like, "Whoa, that guy that I met down
[44:30] there in Calgary, that guy, he he looks
[44:32] like that guy sitting on the throne. Oh
[44:34] my, and I treated him that way." Or, "Oh
[44:38] my, am I ever glad that I treated that
[44:40] guy good?" You never know. We don't
[44:43] know. It's up to
[44:45] God. He says, "I might even forget my
[44:48] name sometime. I can never forget that
[44:49] hour when he delivered me from my sins.
[44:51] Something took place down inside me and
[44:55] it's helped me through the great hours
[44:58] in darkness. The hour of my deliverance,
[45:01] the weights of sin left me and I was a
[45:05] new person. I being a new creature in
[45:08] Christ Jesus ever
[45:10] since. If we're looking to get people to
[45:13] church, it's not going to work. If we're
[45:16] looking to get people to an
[45:18] association, it's not going to work. If
[45:21] we're looking to get people to maybe a
[45:23] theology and and an ideology, just get
[45:26] in the message and everything will be
[45:27] okay. Just follow the prophet. It'll all
[45:29] be okay. If you just only go that far,
[45:33] you're not going to be okay. You have
[45:35] got to get to Jesus Christ because
[45:37] that's why he sent the prophet. The
[45:39] prophet was to introduce the bridegroom
[45:42] to the bride. And if there is an
[45:45] introduction, that's great.
[45:47] Jesus, brother Bradom, he said it. We we
[45:49] read it. You know, sometimes we can just
[45:51] get to Jesus Christ, that woman that had
[45:53] to fight her way to get through the
[45:54] crowd, right? We we talked about this
[45:57] the last couple services. She fought.
[46:00] Blind Barnameus, he fought. He yelled.
[46:04] They told them both to just shut up.
[46:06] Don't get out of order. Don't stand up
[46:08] when the song service is on. We don't
[46:10] want to have too much excitement around
[46:11] here. Don't play too hard. Don't don't
[46:13] don't shout too much. Don't Don't turn
[46:16] into one of those holy roller
[46:17] fundamentalists because we want it to be
[46:19] nice and quiet here. Remember, this is
[46:21] the quietest place we're ever going to
[46:22] live. It's going to be weeping, wailing,
[46:25] and nashing of teeth down in hell.
[46:26] They're going to be screaming the top of
[46:27] their lungs. This is what the prophet of
[46:29] God says. But in heaven, they're going
[46:31] to be rejoicing even louder because they
[46:33] know they're redeemed. And it's only by
[46:34] the election of God we're able to be
[46:37] redeemed, that we're able to say amen to
[46:39] the word of God.
[46:41] It's not a church membership. It's not a
[46:44] traditional teaching. It's Jesus Christ
[46:46] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[46:49] And you know that blood that he shed at
[46:50] Calvary, it's for every single one of
[46:52] us.
[46:54] He would that we all would come and get
[46:57] to know him and the power of his
[46:58] resurrection. But not everyone can. We
[47:01] know that Cain and Abel had the exact
[47:03] same opportunity, didn't they? They had
[47:06] the exact same opportunity. One of them,
[47:08] they both had revelations. They both had
[47:11] revelation. Something fell into their
[47:12] heart and caused them to do something
[47:14] according to the way they believed with
[47:16] all their heart. One of them went and
[47:19] picked all the best fruit of the land.
[47:21] You can imagine the fruit that you would
[47:23] pick in the Garden of Eden. You can
[47:25] imagine what that must have been like
[47:26] around there. There would have been
[47:28] tremendous fruit. So, he put together,
[47:30] we know Cain put together all of the
[47:32] plants and fruits of the field. Just a
[47:34] tremendous, tremendous worship service.
[47:37] All the fruits. Oh my. And his brother,
[47:42] what did he do through his revelation?
[47:43] It wasn't very nice, was it? He grabbed
[47:46] a lamb, pulled back its neck, and
[47:48] chopped it to bits. Chopped that neck
[47:50] with a rock so that it or maybe a sharp
[47:53] knife. They probably had pretty good
[47:54] technology around then. But he chopped
[47:56] the neck of that lamb and got himself
[47:58] all bloody and got the lamb all bloody
[48:00] and got blood all over the place and
[48:02] made a mess. And that lamb was bleeding
[48:04] and screaming and crying. And no doubt
[48:06] Cain was like, "What's the what's the
[48:08] noise? You're interrupting my worship
[48:09] service. Don't get so excited
[48:11] identifying yourself with your
[48:13] sacrifice." But brothers and sisters,
[48:15] that's why we come to church is so that
[48:16] we can identify ourselves with the
[48:19] sacrifice. Instead of trying to identify
[48:21] ourselves as the sacrifice, we don't
[48:24] have a sacrifice to bring. He's brought
[48:26] it. He's already brought the sacrifice.
[48:28] All we need to do is allow that blood to
[48:30] splatter on us and accept it the way
[48:32] that he's given it.
[48:35] Brother says in these Jews, they come up
[48:37] each year, talking about Jerusalem, they
[48:39] come up each year and there was a
[48:41] fountain inside the church and they take
[48:43] the bread and the bitter herbs and the
[48:44] lamb and they drank from this fountain
[48:46] in the church and they rejoiced together
[48:49] because God had showed them favor.
[48:52] They're Jews. They know how to worship.
[48:55] Oh my, there's all these ruddy Gentiles,
[48:58] all these smelly people that are filthy
[49:01] just like the animals. Gentiles out
[49:04] there, right? God showed them favor.
[49:07] They were special people. So, this being
[49:09] the Passover time, and not only was it
[49:11] the Passover, but it was a special
[49:13] Passover, wasn't it? A special Passover.
[49:17] The prophecy went forward that there
[49:20] would be an ass and the full of an ass
[49:23] and the Messiah would ride up into
[49:24] Jerusalem on the back of that fo that
[49:27] was never ever ridden on by a human. He
[49:31] goes on to say, you know, there's
[49:33] sometimes that we got we go to church.
[49:37] We always love to go. Amen. But there's
[49:39] sometimes that something special
[49:42] happens. Yeah. And you know, brothers
[49:44] and sisters, this really is the only
[49:45] quote that I've got today. The rest of
[49:46] it I'm just going to preach. And I I
[49:48] trust that this quote would resonate
[49:50] with us today. I trust that when we
[49:52] leave here today that something special
[49:55] would happen. Something special would
[49:58] take place. That this would not be an
[50:00] ordinary gathering, just traditional
[50:02] worship. Oh, it's just the way that we
[50:05] have a song service and it's just the
[50:06] way that we bring all of the different
[50:09] portions of the service. Let's push
[50:11] aside all of our traditions and
[50:12] teachings and just allow the Lord to
[50:15] manifest the way that he wants to in our
[50:17] lives. Brothers and sisters, let's cast
[50:20] down all of our imaginations. Let's take
[50:23] every single thought into captivity and
[50:25] give him the opportunity to move.
[50:29] Remember, our thoughts are louder in
[50:32] heaven than our words are here on earth.
[50:34] He knows what's in the heart and thought
[50:36] of every single person here, every
[50:38] person that's listening online. God
[50:40] bless you carpenters. It's good to see
[50:42] you. He It's just wonderful to be in his
[50:46] presence, isn't it? You know, talking
[50:48] about the story, brother Brandham, he he
[50:51] goes through and he talks about this and
[50:53] only like the prophet can do. Many
[50:55] people can try and narrate it, but I I
[50:57] believe this and I'm sure we all do that
[50:59] he's able to see with a vision back to
[51:02] certain instances where other people
[51:05] just can't. They can poke at and say,
[51:07] "Well, perhaps it was this way. Now,
[51:09] maybe some people would say, "Brother
[51:10] Barry, you're crazy. You're just just
[51:12] totally out there." But, you know,
[51:13] prophets are different people.
[51:17] Prophets are from their mother's womb.
[51:20] The major prophets. And I would say
[51:22] gifts and callings are without
[51:23] repentance. Every single gift comes from
[51:24] God. And uh I believe that he was able
[51:27] to see things. But, you know, the feast
[51:29] of the Passover is talking about the
[51:30] Pascal lamb. And it was the tradition of
[51:33] the Jews of the Hebrews going all the
[51:35] way back to Goan, right? in Egypt. Let's
[51:39] just turn back there and take a look at
[51:41] it if you don't mind. In Exodus, Exodus
[51:46] 12. And we know that there was a whole
[51:48] bunch of plagues that took place in the
[51:51] land of Egypt while the children of
[51:53] Israel were under severe
[51:55] bondage. Terrible, terrible bondage.
[51:58] Brother Brandham talks about this in in
[52:01] a way that I've never heard expressed
[52:02] before. how a family could be there as
[52:05] slaves, excuse me, and how the task
[52:09] masters could do whatever they wanted to
[52:12] and nobody could do a thing about it. If
[52:15] you rose up against one of the
[52:16] Egyptians, you would lose your life or
[52:19] be severely beaten. But if you had a
[52:21] beautiful family, husband and wife, and
[52:24] a boy and a girl, the Egyptian task
[52:27] masters could come over one day and say,
[52:29] "You know, I've been watching your
[52:30] daughter for years, and she's beautiful,
[52:34] and I want to take her to be my wife
[52:36] right now, and I'm going to." There
[52:39] would be nothing that those Egyptian
[52:42] those those Hebrews could do about it.
[52:44] They had to just let them do whatever
[52:46] you want. But I could imagine there was
[52:48] a few daddies that died because if I was
[52:51] a daddy and that was going to happen, I
[52:53] would die
[52:54] trying. Same thing with wives. If they
[52:58] wanted to take any of the children, they
[52:59] could do whatever they wanted, right?
[53:01] There was no restraints for those task
[53:04] masters there. But the children of
[53:06] Israel now, they cried out because they
[53:08] recognized that there was a prophecy. It
[53:12] was actually a prophecy.
[53:14] The children of Israel, they never had
[53:16] the Old Testament. They didn't even have
[53:19] the Torah then,
[53:21] but they had a prophecy.
[53:24] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[53:26] forever.
[53:28] Either he is or he isn't.
[53:31] Some people want to say that he is. Some
[53:33] people want to say that he isn't. I know
[53:35] the believers say amen to that. We just
[53:36] did. But here we have the children of
[53:38] Israel in bondage. Heavy, heavy bondage.
[53:42] They cry out after 430 years for God to
[53:47] actually come on the scene and deliver
[53:49] them from their captivity. And God
[53:51] finally sends them a deliverer.
[53:55] And it's interesting because it wasn't
[53:57] someone unfamiliar, was it? The
[53:59] deliverer that he sent was someone that
[54:01] they knew.
[54:03] And many of the people, the elders were
[54:05] probably like, "That guy, we prayed for
[54:08] 430 years and you send us this guy. We
[54:12] know this guy. We know his parents. We
[54:15] know where he came from. Isn't it
[54:17] interesting? It's exactly the way that
[54:19] God does things, though.
[54:22] People will say, "Who is this?"
[54:26] Who is this? This is Moses. We know who
[54:29] this guy is. Can't you send us a
[54:31] deliverer?
[54:34] But they cried out and God sent him one.
[54:38] Even Moses didn't believe it. Moses
[54:40] stumbled at it. Moses was like, "Are you
[54:42] serious? I can't do this because I
[54:45] stutter. Don't you know I stutter?"
[54:48] And he's God.
[54:50] He created him that way. He created him
[54:53] that way so that he would be that way so
[54:55] that he could have no trust in his own
[54:57] flesh. And that's the way he's created
[54:59] us, brothers and sisters, so that we
[55:02] won't have confidence in our own flesh.
[55:04] And when we get to be a little bit
[55:05] hotty, what happens? He allows a little
[55:08] bit of a stumble and a little bit of a
[55:09] fall so that he will remind us not to
[55:12] get puffed up beyond the revelations
[55:14] that you got.
[55:18] And as soon as we start to actually
[55:20] recognize that, God will do something
[55:22] special for us.
[55:25] But many times we can get just a little
[55:27] bit, oh
[55:29] my, I feel good. Don't I look good? I'm
[55:33] sure the world thinks I look good. We
[55:35] can get to be that way. Don't get that
[55:38] way. Stay humble.
[55:42] Children of Israel cried for 430 years.
[55:45] 30 years overtime. 30 years past the
[55:47] promise that they should be in bondage
[55:51] for 400 years was the prophecy. 30 years
[55:53] later, they finally started to see
[55:56] things changing. They started to cry
[55:59] out. Fast forward to the last plague. We
[56:02] know there was 10. I've got uh a fair
[56:04] bit that I want to get into here. So,
[56:06] we're just going to talk about the last
[56:07] one out of Exodus 12 verse
[56:13] 21. Moses gets the instruction. God
[56:16] always speaks to his prophet first
[56:18] according to Amos 3:7. That's how he
[56:20] does it. And he did it in the beginning
[56:22] and he'll do it all the way to the end.
[56:25] That's how he does it. Amos 3:7. Exodus
[56:29] 12 21 he says then Moses called for all
[56:32] the elders of Israel and said unto them
[56:35] draw out and take you a lamb according
[56:39] to your families and kill the
[56:43] Passover and ye shall take a bunch of
[56:46] hissup and dip it in the blood that is
[56:49] in the basin and strike the lentil and
[56:51] the two side posts with the blood that
[56:54] is in your basin in the basin. and none
[56:57] of you shall go out the door of his
[57:00] house until the
[57:02] morning. For the Lord will pass through
[57:05] to smite the Egyptians. And when he
[57:08] seeth the blood upon the lentil and on
[57:11] the two sideposts, the Lord will pass
[57:14] over the door, and will not suffer the
[57:16] destroyer to come in unto your houses to
[57:20] smite you.
[57:22] And ye shall observe this thing for an
[57:26] ordinance to thee and to thy
[57:29] sons for just a couple
[57:33] years. Forever.
[57:37] Forever. What a tremendous thing it is
[57:40] to see this. Ye shall do this thing
[57:44] forever. And it shall come to pass that
[57:47] when ye be come to the land which the
[57:51] Lord will give you according as he hath
[57:54] promised that ye shall keep this
[57:57] service. And it shall come to pass when
[58:01] your children shall say unto you, what
[58:04] mean ye by this service? Mommy and
[58:06] daddy, why do we go to communion
[58:08] service? Why do we go and eat the bread
[58:11] and drink the cup? Why do we do that?
[58:14] We need to be able to give them an
[58:16] answer.
[58:18] Now, I know many are saying, "Brother
[58:19] Barry, this is a Passover." Yes, it is.
[58:22] But let's bring it to our day. Let's
[58:24] talk about our day. We've been given
[58:26] instructions for our day. And are we
[58:28] following the instructions for our day?
[58:30] that ye shall say, it is the sacrifice
[58:34] of the Lord's Passover, who passed over
[58:36] the houses of the children of Israel and
[58:38] Egypt, when he smoked the Egyptians and
[58:41] delivered our houses, our houses, and
[58:44] the people bowed the head and worshiped.
[58:47] And it goes on to say that they actually
[58:49] did do what the prophet said. They did
[58:52] as they were instructed. They applied
[58:54] the token. And we know that we had a
[58:56] prophet preach the message the token a
[58:59] few different times. And if we listen to
[59:01] those messages, we hear a very similar
[59:04] story. Follow the words of the prophet.
[59:06] We know in that day they were to kill a
[59:07] lamb. They were to take the blood. They
[59:09] were to apply it. In this day, we're
[59:11] supposed to take that lamb that's
[59:13] already been killed and accept his blood
[59:15] and apply it the way that he has said to
[59:17] do it according to the voice of a
[59:18] vindicated prophet in the day in which
[59:20] we live. But this was the feast of the
[59:22] Passover. This was why Jerusalem was a
[59:25] buzz because they were told, they were
[59:27] instructed back then to keep this
[59:29] Passover, keep this feast and and always
[59:32] remember it forever. Don't ever stop
[59:34] doing it. So, here we are now out of our
[59:38] our scripture this morning in Matthew
[59:41] chapter 21, the Pascal lamb, the feast
[59:44] of the Passover. It's a very interesting
[59:46] thing. this this final plague that that
[59:49] happened before they left in in
[59:52] captivity. Israel parttook of this last
[59:55] event and and now fast forward many many
[59:59] years later in Jerusalem they were doing
[1:00:02] the same thing. They had the desire to
[1:00:05] get together for this. But if you look
[1:00:07] at what was going on in the city, this
[1:00:10] was not an ordinary Passover feast. This
[1:00:14] was something totally different. And I
[1:00:17] love the way brother Bradom, he actually
[1:00:19] expresses this in that message. The the
[1:00:21] city was a buzz. He says the city was
[1:00:23] electrified. There was something going
[1:00:26] to happen. The people just knew it. And
[1:00:28] I can't help but think, brothers and
[1:00:30] sisters, have we ever lived in a time
[1:00:32] where we can look around the world in
[1:00:34] which we live in and know that it's
[1:00:36] electrified, know that it's a buzz?
[1:00:38] Something is about to take place. This
[1:00:41] is on a world scale, though. This is not
[1:00:43] just a localized city. What is it? Or
[1:00:46] better yet, who is it?
[1:00:50] Why are are everybody getting up in
[1:00:53] arms? I think it's just an amazing
[1:00:54] thing. It's an amazing thing. But
[1:00:57] Jerusalem in this day, it was it was a
[1:00:59] very busy that time of year. And we know
[1:01:01] that there was people coming from afar.
[1:01:03] There was special services taking place.
[1:01:06] There was many people as we see in the
[1:01:08] world in which we live today, many
[1:01:10] people celebrating the feast of the
[1:01:11] Passover and and probably people going
[1:01:14] out and and picking and selecting lambs
[1:01:16] and and picking and selecting
[1:01:18] decorations and even still today they
[1:01:20] pick and select palm leaves and some of
[1:01:23] the people will actually bring them and
[1:01:25] and give them out at church. Some of the
[1:01:27] clergy will bless them and and give out
[1:01:29] blessed palm leaves at church and and
[1:01:31] all of that. But we know those are all
[1:01:33] traditional teachings. We know that's
[1:01:36] not doesn't really have any value to a
[1:01:38] Christian today other than a great
[1:01:41] tradition. And I think, you know, it's
[1:01:44] wonderful, but when when you start to
[1:01:46] get into it a little farther, you don't
[1:01:47] have to look very far behind the curtain
[1:01:49] to see where this all comes from. It
[1:01:51] comes from Rome, the the great harlot.
[1:01:54] And and as soon as we start seeing that,
[1:01:56] we got to pump the brakes and say,
[1:01:57] "Nope, that's not what I want to do. I'm
[1:02:00] not handing out palm leaves. We're not
[1:02:02] going to go down to the all of this
[1:02:04] thing." but to recognize what what they
[1:02:06] were doing in Jerusalem while this was
[1:02:08] going on. It was a celebration of the
[1:02:11] the Passover lamb, the pascal lamb. And
[1:02:14] we know the children of Israel were
[1:02:16] taught this very thoroughly. And and it
[1:02:18] seemed that this year was different than
[1:02:20] all of the others. And and we don't have
[1:02:22] to look very far, like I said, to see
[1:02:25] that things are a little bit different
[1:02:26] than they've ever been in this world.
[1:02:28] We've already experienced a pandemic in
[1:02:30] our lives. And you know, just a few
[1:02:32] years ago, people would have to say, I
[1:02:33] would have had to say, "What's a
[1:02:34] pandemic?" I remember when I first
[1:02:36] started hearing the word, I had to type
[1:02:38] it in and say, "What's a pandemic?" And
[1:02:40] some people were saying, "Well, it can't
[1:02:42] be this until they actually call it
[1:02:44] that." But as soon as they call it that,
[1:02:46] then they have the liberties to do what
[1:02:48] they need to do. It It's interesting to
[1:02:50] see the things that we've gone through.
[1:02:52] I I had the pleasure the other night. We
[1:02:54] went to a a little church service at
[1:02:56] that Trinity Lodge and we were able to
[1:02:59] talk to some of the the old folks in
[1:03:01] there and we met a woman who was 102
[1:03:03] years old and to be able to have a
[1:03:05] conversation with her. How many changes
[1:03:07] have you witnessed in this world? 102
[1:03:11] years old. You have seen the horse and
[1:03:14] buggy with no electricity to running
[1:03:16] water to automobiles to rocket ships and
[1:03:20] airplanes. My and now AI,
[1:03:24] what is next?
[1:03:26] I personally have an opinion on that. I
[1:03:28] think it's beautiful when we look at it
[1:03:30] because you you you you can hear about
[1:03:32] people being linked up now. They're
[1:03:34] going to put a neurological implant in
[1:03:35] the brain and you can just think a
[1:03:36] thought and it will link up to a
[1:03:38] computer and kaboom, you'll you'll be
[1:03:40] linked up. That's what people are
[1:03:41] looking for. That's this next wave of AI
[1:03:44] stuff. But you know, it's such a
[1:03:46] beautiful thing because the believers,
[1:03:48] they're linked up already.
[1:03:51] You don't have to give them an implant.
[1:03:53] All you got to do is talk to them for a
[1:03:55] minute or two and you can see that
[1:03:56] they've already applied the blood of the
[1:03:59] lamb to the doorpost and to the lentil
[1:04:01] above and that token is on display in
[1:04:04] their lives.
[1:04:07] But this time of year, this year in
[1:04:10] Jerusalem, something different was
[1:04:12] taking place. This was a special
[1:04:14] Passover. And everybody knew it. But
[1:04:17] they didn't know why. They couldn't
[1:04:19] understand why. And it's the same thing
[1:04:21] in this world today. The people don't
[1:04:23] know why. Yeah. Some people will say
[1:04:26] this and some people will say that. But
[1:04:28] it's interesting because the believers
[1:04:30] know why. The people that are able to
[1:04:31] hear a prophetic utterance. They
[1:04:33] understand what's going on. It's a
[1:04:36] beautiful thing.
[1:04:38] But they were out, no doubt, preparing
[1:04:40] their homes and preparing their churches
[1:04:42] and and preparing their lambs and
[1:04:44] talking about their lambs and comparing
[1:04:46] their lambs and doing everything that
[1:04:48] they normally would do, right? They they
[1:04:50] they probably had people that traveled
[1:04:52] from a long distance and people were
[1:04:55] looking for accommodations and I I think
[1:04:57] I've heard it said in a couple different
[1:04:58] places that the city was full. There was
[1:05:00] no more room for people. Brother
[1:05:01] Brandham even says that they must have
[1:05:02] been laying outside the wall. They were
[1:05:04] laying around the city camping out
[1:05:06] because there was no more room inside
[1:05:08] the city. There was so much of a passion
[1:05:10] to see what was going to take
[1:05:12] place. And what happened? This guy
[1:05:16] riding on a donkey from their
[1:05:19] perspective, just this ordinary man,
[1:05:20] this this Nazarene guy on a donkey. And
[1:05:24] all the people are are screaming and
[1:05:26] yelling and crying hosana and and Lord
[1:05:29] and putting down their clothes and
[1:05:31] waving the palm leaves in the way for
[1:05:33] him to ride in with such great great
[1:05:37] celebration. If he was a king, wouldn't
[1:05:40] it all be golden? Wouldn't it all be
[1:05:41] full of gold?
[1:05:45] You know, it's amazing how people can
[1:05:47] sense that something special or
[1:05:50] different is taking place.
[1:05:54] And I just think, you know, sometimes
[1:05:56] even when we come to church, we can
[1:05:57] sense it that something different is
[1:06:00] taking place.
[1:06:03] And I think that's happening today.
[1:06:06] I really do. And and what's going to
[1:06:09] happen today, brothers and sisters, I if
[1:06:11] if the Lord wills, is that we'll either
[1:06:14] get
[1:06:15] saved and filled by the Holy Ghost or
[1:06:17] we'll get more of that Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:06:20] Amen. We're going to see signs and
[1:06:22] wonders. They'll all follow. Don't worry
[1:06:23] about signs and wonders. They'll all
[1:06:25] follow.
[1:06:27] That'll happen. Let's put the word
[1:06:29] first. Let's put Jesus Christ first.
[1:06:32] Remember the story of the the 10
[1:06:35] virgins, the five wise and the five
[1:06:38] unwise. How the five wise, they had oil
[1:06:43] in their vessels. They had just a little
[1:06:45] bit extra oil. And I can't help but
[1:06:48] think they just maybe did a little bit
[1:06:50] more trying to get oil. They just had a
[1:06:53] desire in their heart to say, "Lord,
[1:06:55] here is my cup. I I don't care who's
[1:06:58] looking. I I don't care about the things
[1:07:01] in the past. I don't care about how sore
[1:07:02] my arms are. I don't care about any of
[1:07:04] that. I'm just going to raise my cup to
[1:07:06] the Lord and say, "Fill me up, Lord. I'm
[1:07:09] just looking for a little bit more of
[1:07:10] that oil in my life."
[1:07:12] I just can't help but think that would
[1:07:14] be the story of those five wise virgins.
[1:07:17] Now, some people might be be willing to
[1:07:20] say, "Brother Barry, it's not that way."
[1:07:21] Well, it's okay. It's fine. But are we
[1:07:25] willing to actually humble ourselves in
[1:07:27] the sight of the Lord so that he can
[1:07:28] pick us up?
[1:07:31] Or do we say, "You know what? I got it.
[1:07:34] I got it. Had it for years. Nothing's
[1:07:37] going to change in my life." When that
[1:07:39] happens, I'll tell you what happens. The
[1:07:42] other story, we have to compare it to
[1:07:44] scripture. When Jesus comes by, if we're
[1:07:47] not willing to give him the glory that
[1:07:49] he wants, if we're not willing to have
[1:07:52] the fruit of the spirit on our branches,
[1:07:55] when he comes by, for him to just pick
[1:07:57] some love, for him to just pick some
[1:07:59] joy. Remember, the joy of
[1:08:01] our strength, the joy of the Lord is our
[1:08:04] strength. when he comes by and he's
[1:08:06] looking for fruit, we could find
[1:08:07] ourselves to be like that fig tree.
[1:08:09] Yeah. He might only come by our lives
[1:08:11] one time. Brother Brandham says he might
[1:08:13] only call us ever one time. And if he
[1:08:16] comes by our way and we don't have any
[1:08:19] fruit and he's hungering again, I know
[1:08:22] it's probably a bit of a stretch, but
[1:08:23] brothers and sisters, I don't think so.
[1:08:25] I think it's exactly like that. If we're
[1:08:28] not willing to actually have that fruit
[1:08:29] on our branch for him when he comes by,
[1:08:32] he might say, "There ain't going to be
[1:08:34] no fruit from this day forwards. You
[1:08:36] have crossed that line."
[1:08:38] And you know that line is that line is
[1:08:41] just like the rich young ruler. That
[1:08:43] rich young ruler, he did not have the
[1:08:45] fruit in his life to line up with the
[1:08:47] word in his day. He came face to face
[1:08:50] with the word in his day and he could
[1:08:53] not recognize it. He said, "You know
[1:08:54] what? I'm good, man. Our family business
[1:08:56] is rocking. We're so good. We've got
[1:08:58] everything we need. I've been a believer
[1:09:00] my whole entire life. My parents brought
[1:09:02] me to church every Sunday. I know the
[1:09:04] scripture inside out. Look at our
[1:09:06] clothes. Look at our worship. Look at
[1:09:08] our our lentils and a doorpost. We've
[1:09:10] got everything.
[1:09:12] But what did Jesus
[1:09:14] say? Give it all to the poor because it
[1:09:17] means nothing. Amen. And follow
[1:09:20] me. And he couldn't do it. The word says
[1:09:23] that he was sorrowful. And what did he
[1:09:26] do? He met that that Lord. He met the
[1:09:28] word for his day. And that was the
[1:09:30] separating line. And what did he do the
[1:09:31] very next part of that story? He lifted
[1:09:33] up his eyes in hell. He lifted up his
[1:09:36] eyes in hell. And he had the
[1:09:38] conversation with Abraham. Abraham, I'm
[1:09:41] dying over here. Give me some reprieve.
[1:09:44] And he said, "Hey man, you had the
[1:09:46] opportunity in life. That Lazarus here,
[1:09:49] you want him to come and cool your
[1:09:51] tongue. get him to come and just do
[1:09:53] exactly what you're used to doing.
[1:09:54] Getting your way every single time you
[1:09:56] desire to have your way. Well, listen.
[1:09:59] Your way's over. You had the
[1:10:01] opportunity. You crossed that line. And
[1:10:04] now there's no coming back. And what did
[1:10:06] he say? Well, oh, if you can't save save
[1:10:09] me anymore. If there's no hope for me,
[1:10:10] then send someone from the dead to go
[1:10:12] and tell my brothers, tell my family.
[1:10:14] Don't let them come to this perishing
[1:10:17] place. But what did Abraham say? If they
[1:10:21] won't hear the prophets,
[1:10:23] they won't hear someone that's come back
[1:10:25] from the dead. Can you believe that?
[1:10:29] That is the resiliency of the human.
[1:10:32] That's Cain's DNA inside of us. Without
[1:10:36] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:10:38] our lives, Cain's DNA is going to take
[1:10:41] us there.
[1:10:43] That's where it is, brothers and
[1:10:45] sisters. It's not a playtime. Coming to
[1:10:47] church is not just a tradition.
[1:10:50] Coming to a communion service is not
[1:10:52] just something we do because we're just
[1:10:54] told to do it and we just go and do it
[1:10:56] and we go home and we don't understand
[1:10:58] it. We go and identify ourselves with
[1:11:01] our Pascal lamb. We drink his blood. We
[1:11:04] eat his flesh. We're not vampires. We
[1:11:07] are applying the token the way that
[1:11:09] we've been given instruction to apply
[1:11:11] it.
[1:11:14] The air in that day was charged with
[1:11:16] expectancy. They were expecting
[1:11:18] something to happen.
[1:11:20] They knew something was going to happen.
[1:11:22] And I want to say this, brothers and
[1:11:24] sisters. Let's bring it down to our day.
[1:11:26] How does this apply to us in our day?
[1:11:28] Take a look at the world. What's going
[1:11:30] on today in the world? It's shaken up.
[1:11:34] And how is it shaken? Oh my. Isn't it
[1:11:37] interesting that it's exactly what the
[1:11:39] prophet of God said for us in our day?
[1:11:41] How is the harlot going to take over?
[1:11:46] How's the harlot going to take over?
[1:11:48] Through the finances. Isn't it
[1:11:50] interesting that there's something
[1:11:51] that's just shaky all over the place? Oh
[1:11:54] my, what's going on? The world is paying
[1:11:57] attention. Everyone in the world is
[1:12:00] sitting on the edge of their seats
[1:12:01] wondering what's going on. I could only
[1:12:03] imagine, I'm not an investor. I don't
[1:12:05] have a portfolio, but I can only imagine
[1:12:08] for the people that do, they're on the
[1:12:10] edge of their seat. They can't wait to
[1:12:12] get out of church to go and look at the
[1:12:13] stock market because they know it's
[1:12:16] shaky. They know something's happening.
[1:12:18] There's an expectation for something.
[1:12:20] And as believers, we can say something's
[1:12:23] happening. What's happening in the USA?
[1:12:25] Brothers and sisters, I put it in my
[1:12:27] notes to say, what's happening in
[1:12:29] Revelations chapter 13? For the people
[1:12:32] that don't know it, I want to say it
[1:12:33] that way. What's happening in
[1:12:34] Revelations chapter 13? It's coming to
[1:12:37] pass before our eyes. Yes. Don't think
[1:12:40] that the bride's going to be out of here
[1:12:42] before some of this stuff takes place.
[1:12:44] It's happening right now. My what's
[1:12:48] happening in Russia?
[1:12:50] Why do I say that? The prophet in 1933,
[1:12:53] he said, "Watch Russia.
[1:12:57] Watch Russia." Why would he say that?
[1:13:00] There was no Russia.
[1:13:04] There was a Soviet Union.
[1:13:08] Watch Russia, the king of the
[1:13:11] north. Russia was not Russia in
[1:13:17] 1933. From 1922 to
[1:13:20] 1991, it was the Soviet Union.
[1:13:26] Yeah. Russia, they had a monarchy and it
[1:13:29] was called
[1:13:30] Russia. Russia had a monarchy right up
[1:13:33] to
[1:13:34] 1917. And that's when the Russian
[1:13:36] Revolution took over. I think it's
[1:13:39] really interesting to take a look at
[1:13:41] this. I've never been into history
[1:13:42] really until I heard God sent a prophet.
[1:13:45] And now I look at these things and I I
[1:13:47] scratch my head for a while. I thought,
[1:13:49] you know, I don't know, whatever. It's
[1:13:50] what he said. But go and look it up. Go
[1:13:53] and look it up. It just makes you want
[1:13:54] to say, lift up your heads because our
[1:13:57] redemption drawth nigh, brothers and
[1:13:59] sisters. That's why I'm crying out, get
[1:14:02] to Christ.
[1:14:03] What was Noah like before God shut that
[1:14:06] door. He said, "Get in the boat." He
[1:14:09] must have been banging on on drums and
[1:14:11] and and screaming at the top of his
[1:14:13] lungs, "Get in the boat."
[1:14:16] Imagine the technology. Brother Bam said
[1:14:18] there was a greater technology they had
[1:14:19] than before the flood, right? Maybe he
[1:14:21] had some sort of a a way to communicate
[1:14:24] around the world. He could he could
[1:14:26] expound his voice to everyone. And they
[1:14:29] were probably like, "Shut up, man. We're
[1:14:31] sick and tired of hearing this guy
[1:14:32] banging on the drums and constantly
[1:14:35] harping about rain and we can prove
[1:14:37] scientifically there's no rain going to
[1:14:39] come.
[1:14:42] But God shut the door.
[1:14:45] But Russia, they had a monarchy up until
[1:14:47] 1917 when the Russian Revolution took
[1:14:49] over and it was overthrowing that
[1:14:51] monarchy rule. And I can't help but
[1:14:53] think this was exactly according to the
[1:14:55] go plan of God so that this country
[1:14:57] wouldn't even be called Russia. So
[1:14:59] people would say when that prophetic
[1:15:01] utterance came to pass, he's wrong. He
[1:15:04] said, "Watch Russia. Where's Russia?
[1:15:07] It's history." He's wrong. He missed the
[1:15:10] mark. Did he?
[1:15:15] In
[1:15:16] 1991, the
[1:15:18] SFSR emerged again. The Russian
[1:15:22] SFSR in 1991. And you know, the Russian
[1:15:26] Federation came from that.
[1:15:29] And where do we stand today, brothers
[1:15:30] and sisters? This world that we live in
[1:15:33] is charged. It is electrically charged
[1:15:37] with anticipation that something is
[1:15:39] going to happen. And what is it that's
[1:15:41] going to happen? The stock market's
[1:15:42] going to crash or the stock market's
[1:15:45] going to soar or that some country is
[1:15:47] going to take over? America is going to
[1:15:49] become great again. Isn't it
[1:15:51] interesting? If you take a look at
[1:15:53] Trump, I'm not going to get political
[1:15:54] from the platform here, but I am going
[1:15:56] to say this. That man believes that he
[1:15:59] is supposed to be there by God. He
[1:16:03] believes that. He's not just pretending
[1:16:06] that. And who could pretend that? To be
[1:16:10] standing at a podium and to just say,
[1:16:12] "Look at that chart." And to look and
[1:16:14] just as he turns his head, a shots fired
[1:16:17] and it just clips his ear.
[1:16:20] If anybody has ever shot a gun, you know
[1:16:22] that a 100 120 yard shot with a gun like
[1:16:25] he had is a given. You should never miss
[1:16:28] a shot like that. Here I am talking
[1:16:31] about this. Why? Because there's an
[1:16:34] anointing in Revelations 13 that has to
[1:16:37] come to pass. And if you wonder what it
[1:16:38] is, go read it when you go home. It's
[1:16:41] talking about the USA. Yes,
[1:16:45] we had talked about this brother
[1:16:47] Brandham saying there will come a time
[1:16:48] where they'll be able to call fire down
[1:16:50] from the sky. This is out of
[1:16:53] Revelations. It's history. Brother
[1:16:55] Brandham says Revelations 13, the USA.
[1:16:59] He talks about the the little lamb
[1:17:02] coming up with two horns. And what is
[1:17:05] it? He says it very clearly. The
[1:17:07] American buffalo. He identifies it very
[1:17:10] clearly in a prophetic utterance about
[1:17:12] the United States. There's a reason why
[1:17:14] that guy is in
[1:17:16] power. And there's a reason why there's
[1:17:18] so much hatred. Why is there so much
[1:17:22] hatred? Why can't it just be like, you
[1:17:24] know, we don't really like the policy.
[1:17:26] We don't really like the I don't know,
[1:17:28] maybe I am getting political and I don't
[1:17:30] mean to, but why is there so much hatred
[1:17:32] over this? because it's prophetic
[1:17:35] material coming to pass. Brothers and
[1:17:38] sisters, it just makes me say, where do
[1:17:40] we stand today? This world is
[1:17:42] supercharged with anticipation that
[1:17:44] something is taking place. And as
[1:17:47] believers of this message of the hour, I
[1:17:49] think we've got every single reason to
[1:17:50] shift gears and just give God the praise
[1:17:53] and just give God the glory and
[1:17:55] recognize what he's done for us because
[1:17:56] this whole world is about to go over the
[1:17:59] falls. But we are going to go up when
[1:18:01] the world goes down. Brothers and
[1:18:02] sisters, we're not going into
[1:18:04] destruction.
[1:18:07] If the devil has given us something that
[1:18:09] makes us feel like I just don't feel
[1:18:11] like worshiping, just worship.
[1:18:14] I wish I could sing that song. Just
[1:18:16] worship. I don't know it enough yet.
[1:18:18] We'll get one of the brothers to come
[1:18:19] and sing it. But what a tremendous song.
[1:18:21] Just worship when we don't even feel
[1:18:22] like it. Worship when the problems come.
[1:18:25] Just worship when everything else is
[1:18:27] falling apart. Just give him praise.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:30] I got into talking about uh some stuff
[1:18:33] in the Bible study this week and
[1:18:35] thinking about it and you know the
[1:18:36] children of Israel when they first had
[1:18:38] their very first conquest when they got
[1:18:40] into the promised land that was the city
[1:18:42] of Jericho and how we had the the
[1:18:44] children of Israel, they're not
[1:18:46] warriors. They're they're they're just
[1:18:48] children of Israel that came out of
[1:18:49] bondage and wandering in the wilderness
[1:18:51] and following God Almighty. And here
[1:18:54] they are now trying to figure out what's
[1:18:56] going to happen. How are they going to
[1:18:57] get those walls down? How are they going
[1:18:58] to get through those impenetrable walls
[1:19:00] that they could race chariots on? If you
[1:19:02] think about how wide those walls are,
[1:19:04] those are huge
[1:19:05] walls. But how could they do it? God
[1:19:08] gave them instruction.
[1:19:10] God himself came down and gave them
[1:19:12] instruction. And you know, is it any
[1:19:14] different today?
[1:19:16] I want to say he's come down and give us
[1:19:18] instruction. We'll get into that a
[1:19:19] little further here, but he's come down
[1:19:21] and given us instruction, too. But the
[1:19:23] children of Israel, they were given
[1:19:24] instruction. You know what? If you just
[1:19:26] march around this city once a day for
[1:19:29] seven days and remember, don't say a
[1:19:32] word. You guys have a history of
[1:19:35] murmuring. You got a history of chirping
[1:19:38] off in the background about this and
[1:19:40] about that and about the other thing.
[1:19:42] But is it any accident he said that?
[1:19:44] Shut your mouths and march. And I
[1:19:47] believe that's the commission for us
[1:19:48] today is just shut our mouths and march
[1:19:51] forward. Let's go together.
[1:19:54] How can we see the walls of our enemies
[1:19:56] come down if we're not united together?
[1:20:00] Hallelujah. Oh my. But what was it? If
[1:20:03] you can do it for six days, on the
[1:20:04] seventh day, I want you to lift your
[1:20:06] voices. I want you to shout. I want you
[1:20:08] to blow on the horns. I want you to play
[1:20:10] the instruments. I want you to be as
[1:20:12] loud as you possibly can because your
[1:20:15] deliverance is here. And they followed
[1:20:17] that instruction and they saw God come
[1:20:19] on the scene. And those walls that they
[1:20:22] were racing chariots on, they must have
[1:20:23] been engineered walls. They must have
[1:20:25] been super structures. But what did they
[1:20:27] do? They tumbled to the ground
[1:20:30] and they went in and they took over
[1:20:32] because they followed the instruction of
[1:20:34] the Lord that came to the prophet and
[1:20:37] the prophet gave them the instruction
[1:20:39] and they were able to go forward. You
[1:20:41] know, brother Ratomy says this in in
[1:20:43] this message and I just think it's so
[1:20:44] good. He will appear to those who are
[1:20:48] expecting to see him. Yes. Amen.
[1:20:51] Brothers and sisters, when you came to
[1:20:53] church today, who did you come expecting
[1:20:55] to see?
[1:20:56] Did you come expecting to see Brother
[1:20:58] Barry? Cuz if you did, I'm
[1:21:01] sorry. I can't bring anything. But if
[1:21:05] you come expecting to see Jesus Christ,
[1:21:08] something different is going to take
[1:21:09] place. And you know, brothers and
[1:21:11] sisters, I want to change your focus. If
[1:21:13] you are looking at brother Barry, stop
[1:21:15] it. Brother Barry will lead you to
[1:21:17] destruction.
[1:21:19] But Jesus Christ, he will save you and
[1:21:22] your house. He'll save you and your
[1:21:24] family. He'll save you and your
[1:21:26] children. He'll save you and your
[1:21:27] marriage. He'll save every single one of
[1:21:30] us.
[1:21:32] Those who expect him will see him.
[1:21:38] Just can't help but think it's such a
[1:21:40] fitting title for this message today.
[1:21:43] For this message that brother Brandham
[1:21:44] preached back there. Who is
[1:21:46] this? And brother Brandham, he talks
[1:21:49] about it over and over again in that
[1:21:50] message. Who is this? Who is this man?
[1:21:54] He's this wacky Nazarene that's from out
[1:21:57] there. And we know his dad and we we
[1:21:59] know his mom and and and we know all
[1:22:01] about him. We know his aunts and his
[1:22:02] uncles and especially his crazy cousin
[1:22:05] that's out there dunking people in the
[1:22:07] in the Jordan River. We know all about
[1:22:10] all of them and they're all out of line
[1:22:12] according to church order, right? Ha.
[1:22:15] But they were all the way in order
[1:22:17] according to the word of God. According
[1:22:19] to the prophetic utterance in their day,
[1:22:22] I think it's beautiful. Who is this?
[1:22:24] Isn't it just the same thing today,
[1:22:26] brothers and sisters? We can get caught
[1:22:28] up in looking around saying, "Who is
[1:22:29] this?" We get a new guest minister that
[1:22:32] will come to the church. People will
[1:22:33] say, "Who is
[1:22:35] this?" My goodness, maybe someone will
[1:22:37] want to give a testimony. Who is this?
[1:22:40] How could God do that in a person's
[1:22:42] life? Don't ever think, don't ever
[1:22:44] discount that God won't do things in our
[1:22:46] lives today. The signs and wonders have
[1:22:48] to follow those who believe.
[1:22:51] Why do they have to? Because the prophet
[1:22:54] in our day, I say God through the
[1:22:56] prophet said that Mark 16 in action is
[1:23:00] what? It's the true church and all else
[1:23:03] is
[1:23:04] false. I think it's amazing when we look
[1:23:07] at it because isn't it wild when you
[1:23:09] look at the Catholic Church, they search
[1:23:11] high and low. They scour the earth to
[1:23:14] find miracles that they can actually
[1:23:17] endorse and verify to be miracles in the
[1:23:20] Catholic Church. But yet the believers
[1:23:22] of this word, they just happen.
[1:23:26] How many of us in this building this
[1:23:28] morning has never seen a miracle?
[1:23:30] Remember, there's a difference between
[1:23:32] healing that takes time, which is a
[1:23:35] miracle, and then there's instantaneous
[1:23:36] miracles. I believe that every one of
[1:23:38] us, you don't have to put your hand up,
[1:23:39] but I believe every one of us could say,
[1:23:41] "I've witnessed the miraculous power of
[1:23:43] God in my life. I have seen miracles in
[1:23:46] my life. I have seen marriages restored.
[1:23:49] I've seen children come to the altar. I
[1:23:51] have seen people get saved. I have seen
[1:23:54] all manner I've seen friendships
[1:23:55] restored. I've seen all manner of things
[1:23:57] happen in my life. It's not foreign to
[1:24:00] us." That's the believer's life, right?
[1:24:05] But many people will look around and
[1:24:07] say, "Who is this? Oh my, this guy
[1:24:10] here. He's puffing himself up. Who is
[1:24:13] this guy? This guy again?
[1:24:17] Really?" They should have recognized him
[1:24:20] in the day in which Jesus was there.
[1:24:22] They should have recognized that this
[1:24:24] was the King of Glory riding on the full
[1:24:27] of an ass. They should have recognized
[1:24:29] him.
[1:24:31] And how is it, how amazing is it for us
[1:24:34] today to be able to recognize him when
[1:24:38] we can recognize him, brothers and
[1:24:40] sisters? That is, I think, the greatest
[1:24:42] miracle ever. The greatest miracle in
[1:24:45] our lives because that will change us
[1:24:48] forever. That will give us the ability
[1:24:50] to overcome and sit with him in his
[1:24:54] throne. Attending church won't do that.
[1:24:57] attending church, just attending church,
[1:24:59] having good church attendance will put
[1:25:01] us in the
[1:25:01] tribulation. We can go to church every
[1:25:04] single day of our lives and not receive
[1:25:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We
[1:25:07] haven't received that token. We haven't
[1:25:09] applied it the way we're supposed to.
[1:25:10] He's not going to say to us, "Oh my, you
[1:25:12] had a really good church attendance.
[1:25:14] Look at the sheet, all the services that
[1:25:16] you did. Look at all the tithes that you
[1:25:18] gave. Look at all of your good service
[1:25:21] and works." It's not going to have
[1:25:23] anything to do with it. He's going to
[1:25:24] say, "Did you take my word the way that
[1:25:26] I gave it to you in the day in which you
[1:25:27] lived? Or did you say, "I I I don't
[1:25:30] really like it. I think I'm just going
[1:25:32] to put my own spin on it. Are we going
[1:25:34] to call it a hybrid
[1:25:36] religion?" A little tiny speck of leaven
[1:25:39] will leaven the whole entire lump.
[1:25:41] Anybody who bakes knows exactly what I'm
[1:25:43] talking about. One little speck of yeast
[1:25:46] in the lump and that whole lump is going
[1:25:49] to become risen with yeast. But if we're
[1:25:53] able to recognize him today, where is he
[1:25:55] today, brothers and sisters? Every
[1:25:56] single one of us. But he's come in the
[1:25:59] word coming which was prophesied for our
[1:26:02] day according to Malachi. Because what's
[1:26:05] what does it say? It says that he will
[1:26:06] come and he will turn the hearts of the
[1:26:09] children back to the faith of the
[1:26:11] Pentecostal fathers.
[1:26:14] Doesn't say that Jesus Christ will come
[1:26:15] and walk again on earth and reveal
[1:26:18] himself to his brethren. doesn't say
[1:26:19] that he'll come and get on the the fo of
[1:26:21] an ass and ride up into Jerusalem. It
[1:26:23] does say that he will, however, come
[1:26:25] back to Jerusalem. And I think that's
[1:26:26] beautiful. I want to get to that here.
[1:26:28] But, you know, he is the same yesterday,
[1:26:30] today, and forever. And I think the crux
[1:26:32] of this whole entire message as we're
[1:26:34] just about halfway through it here is
[1:26:37] brother Bradam says it in in in his
[1:26:39] message. And that is simple. It's it's
[1:26:42] today, brothers and sisters. Today, Palm
[1:26:44] Sunday 2025. Who do you say this is? Who
[1:26:49] do you say this is? Who do you say this
[1:26:52] message of the hour is? Because if the
[1:26:54] message of the hour is simple print and
[1:26:58] tape, it's simple study and
[1:27:01] understanding. If that's what it is,
[1:27:03] you've missed the purpose of the
[1:27:04] message. Amen. Get the quickening of the
[1:27:07] Holy Ghost in your life and allow him,
[1:27:09] this the teacher, the spirit of truth
[1:27:12] come in and he will reveal it all to
[1:27:14] you. The message will become a new
[1:27:16] message. It'll become a brand new
[1:27:17] message. It won't just be how to live a
[1:27:18] good life and make other people think
[1:27:20] that you're good saved person. It will
[1:27:22] be that you are a new creature in Christ
[1:27:24] Jesus. Something will take place on the
[1:27:26] inside. And when that happens, you will
[1:27:28] not be the same that you've ever been
[1:27:30] before in your life. You will become a
[1:27:32] new creature. People will say to you,
[1:27:34] "Who are you and what have you done with
[1:27:36] the old you?" People will recognize
[1:27:39] something has taken place. He is the
[1:27:42] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:27:44] you know, when he walked here on earth,
[1:27:46] I know we're preaching to the choir
[1:27:47] here, but if he could save and heal
[1:27:50] people while he was here on earth,
[1:27:51] couldn't he do the same when he's inside
[1:27:53] of you and me? Couldn't he do the same
[1:27:56] right now today? Even in this meeting,
[1:27:58] we know that when Jesus was here on
[1:28:00] earth, he was preaching the word. And
[1:28:02] even while he was preaching the word,
[1:28:04] people were delivered of devils. And I
[1:28:07] think this is the exact same word. This
[1:28:09] is no different word. And I think it has
[1:28:11] the exact same power. So I think it's a
[1:28:14] beautiful thing where the spirit of the
[1:28:16] Lord is, there is liberty. If we've got
[1:28:18] demons that are coming around and trying
[1:28:20] to get us down and make us think that we
[1:28:22] don't have the Holy Ghost, tell them, "I
[1:28:24] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:26] because I know that my redeemer lives. I
[1:28:29] know that I've met the requirements."
[1:28:31] That's all we need to do. Brothers and
[1:28:33] sisters, we can't say that, "Oh, I've
[1:28:35] done this or that." The only thing that
[1:28:37] I've done is followed the requirements
[1:28:38] that God has given us in a day in which
[1:28:40] we live. So, who do you say this is?
[1:28:44] This is the most important revelation
[1:28:46] that there is. It has to come right down
[1:28:48] home. We have got to be willing to say,
[1:28:51] "I know who it is. I know who it is.
[1:28:53] It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:28:55] today, and forever." And I'm going to
[1:28:56] say it this way. It's not Joseph in
[1:28:59] Jeffersonville, Indiana. God bless him.
[1:29:03] It's not anybody else in this world, any
[1:29:05] other great ministry. It's Jesus Christ.
[1:29:09] It has to be Jesus Christ. He's the only
[1:29:11] one that died on the cross for all of
[1:29:14] our sins and rose again so that we could
[1:29:16] have redemption.
[1:29:20] But there's people that are doing wacky
[1:29:22] things. And I'll say this, I want people
[1:29:24] to know my heart. I don't believe that
[1:29:26] brother Joseph is bad. I'm not going to
[1:29:29] judge him. It's up to God to do that.
[1:29:31] But what I do think happens, Brother
[1:29:33] Bradam says it, is that the people the
[1:29:34] people do these things. The people exalt
[1:29:37] ministries. Yes, it's the people. That's
[1:29:42] the push. God bless brother Joseph for
[1:29:45] his desire to get this word out there,
[1:29:49] to get it in print form, to get it in
[1:29:51] CDs, to get it all around the world now
[1:29:54] for free on an app.
[1:29:57] There is a tremendous reward waiting for
[1:29:59] him in heaven.
[1:30:04] Brothers and sisters, while he was going
[1:30:06] up into the city to change gears a
[1:30:09] little
[1:30:10] bit, while Jesus was going up into the
[1:30:14] city, he was singing. They were singing
[1:30:19] hosana. When they were
[1:30:22] singing, I don't even know if they
[1:30:24] recognized. Did they recognize who he
[1:30:26] was?
[1:30:28] Perhaps some people could, but for the
[1:30:31] most part, I don't know. I wonder. I
[1:30:34] just wonder. I do. I'm not doing
[1:30:36] anything. I'm not trying to be koi or
[1:30:39] anything. I just wonder. Did they
[1:30:41] recognize who is really
[1:30:43] there today? Do we recognize who is
[1:30:47] really here?
[1:30:49] Not coming. Don't look for him to come,
[1:30:51] brothers and sisters, because I want to
[1:30:52] say this. I want to say this and I hope
[1:30:54] it can go on record and then I'll be
[1:30:56] really clear. If we miss his coming now,
[1:30:58] we're gonna miss his coming there. Amen.
[1:31:01] Did you hear me? If we miss his coming
[1:31:04] here, we're gonna miss it there.
[1:31:08] We're going to find ourselves before the
[1:31:10] white throne judgment saying, "Wasn't
[1:31:12] Elias supposed to first come?" And what
[1:31:15] will he say? Hey, I told you time and
[1:31:18] time again that Elias surely will come
[1:31:21] first. And he did. And you never
[1:31:23] listened.
[1:31:25] But when we're singing hosana, who are
[1:31:27] we singing to?
[1:31:30] Are we singing to the song
[1:31:32] leader? If we're singing to the song
[1:31:34] leader, we've missed it
[1:31:37] entirely. Don't sing to the song
[1:31:40] leader. Don't sing to anybody else. When
[1:31:42] we sing a special, who are we singing
[1:31:45] to?
[1:31:47] When we clap after a
[1:31:49] special, who are we clapping to?
[1:31:52] Right? You know, in the world audiences
[1:31:56] for performances, they clap for good
[1:32:01] performances. We're not clapping for
[1:32:03] good performances here, brothers and
[1:32:05] sisters. And I want to say this, Lord,
[1:32:07] forgive us if we have been because what
[1:32:10] we're clapping for is the glory to God.
[1:32:13] That's the only reason we are here is to
[1:32:16] bring glory to God. Because when we give
[1:32:19] glory to God, he blesses our lives.
[1:32:24] But back then when they were singing
[1:32:26] hosana as he went up and remember
[1:32:28] brothers and sisters, nobody knew the
[1:32:30] gravity of him going up into Jerusalem
[1:32:33] except for him. Think about how heavy
[1:32:37] that weight was on the back of that fo.
[1:32:41] The weight of the world
[1:32:44] because it was the Messiah going up to
[1:32:46] be crucified.
[1:32:49] He was going into Jerusalem to end his
[1:32:51] earthly
[1:32:53] life for our sakes.
[1:32:57] When they were singing, "Hosana, hosana,
[1:33:00] glory, hosana. What was it they were
[1:33:03] doing?" I can only imagine they were
[1:33:05] caught up maybe in the spirit. They were
[1:33:07] caught up in the fervent, in the buzz.
[1:33:09] There was something going on. Maybe this
[1:33:10] is what's going on. Why don't we get
[1:33:11] involved? Let's celebrate with this. You
[1:33:13] know, some people are just looking for
[1:33:14] something to get involved in.
[1:33:17] I want to say just get involved with
[1:33:19] this word for our day and see what
[1:33:20] happens. Just do that. We don't need to
[1:33:23] be out there protesting. We don't need
[1:33:24] to go and try and find something to get
[1:33:27] behind. If you want to get behind
[1:33:29] something, go and start telling people
[1:33:31] how it got lit and see what happens. If
[1:33:33] we need a rush, that's all we need to do
[1:33:35] is get people to Christ. When we can see
[1:33:37] people get to Christ Jesus and become
[1:33:39] transformed by the transforming power of
[1:33:42] the Holy Ghost in the day in which we
[1:33:44] live, we can see that person change from
[1:33:47] the inside out. My goodness, that's the
[1:33:50] greatest thing that we can witness. But
[1:33:52] back then, 2,000 years ago, this man
[1:33:54] from Nazareth, they were worshiping,
[1:33:56] singing, hosana, glory, glory to God.
[1:34:00] Hosana is our rock. They were singing
[1:34:04] this. And what did they see? They just
[1:34:07] saw a man on the back of a a fool going
[1:34:10] up to
[1:34:12] Calvary. And we know that what was the
[1:34:15] very next thing that Jesus did when he
[1:34:17] got in
[1:34:18] there. Can only imagine some of these
[1:34:21] people were tithe payers. Some of these
[1:34:23] people had investments in the
[1:34:26] church. What did Jesus do? The first
[1:34:28] thing he went to the temple as it was
[1:34:32] his custom. He went in there and he
[1:34:35] braided together a rope and he started
[1:34:38] whipping them and he started kicking
[1:34:40] over the money tables, the money
[1:34:42] changers, and telling the people, "This,
[1:34:45] my father's house, was created to be a
[1:34:48] house of prayer." Amen. But you've
[1:34:50] turned it into a den of thieves. And we
[1:34:53] know this is the only place written in
[1:34:54] scripture where he actually got angry.
[1:34:57] It was with the religious people and
[1:34:58] their money. Isn't that interesting?
[1:35:02] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:35:03] forever.
[1:35:05] What does Palm Sunday mean to you today,
[1:35:07] brothers and
[1:35:08] sisters? We know that this was the
[1:35:11] entrance into our redemption. This was
[1:35:15] the entrance of Messiah so that he could
[1:35:18] go and take the weight of the world. Not
[1:35:20] just our sin, but every human that ever
[1:35:23] lived on this planet. Take their sin. Oh
[1:35:27] my. And make an atonement for it.
[1:35:30] I just want to try and remind us what
[1:35:32] this day represents. It is not palm
[1:35:36] leaves. It is not about getting Easter
[1:35:39] bunnies. It's not about chocolate.
[1:35:44] It's not about eggs.
[1:35:47] It's not about any of that.
[1:35:50] This season is about our redemption.
[1:35:53] Amen. This season is about Jesus Christ
[1:35:57] knowing that nobody nobody out of the
[1:36:00] millions of people that are celebrating
[1:36:02] about this Passover. Nobody understands
[1:36:05] what the true Passover really is. That
[1:36:08] the Passover is going to happen once
[1:36:11] again. Just like we read in the book of
[1:36:13] Exodus, that Passover will happen. And I
[1:36:15] want to say today, brothers and sisters,
[1:36:17] it's happening. The death angel is
[1:36:19] passing through the land right now. And
[1:36:22] if we're not applying the token the way
[1:36:23] that we're instructed to, I say, Lord,
[1:36:26] help us apply that token the way that
[1:36:28] you've instructed for us in the day in
[1:36:30] which we live.
[1:36:33] Because what did he do? That death
[1:36:35] angel, he didn't come for the parents.
[1:36:37] No. No. He came for the firstborn,
[1:36:38] didn't he? Hey, he's the same yesterday,
[1:36:42] today, and forever.
[1:36:44] He's going to come for our children.
[1:36:46] That's what he's going to do. He's going
[1:36:49] to allow our children if we don't have
[1:36:51] that token applied over top of our
[1:36:53] children look out. He's the same
[1:36:56] yesterday, today, and forever. What does
[1:36:58] Palm Sunday mean to us this year,
[1:37:00] brothers and
[1:37:01] sisters?
[1:37:04] 2025, over 2,000 years later. What does
[1:37:06] it mean? I want to say it. If we're
[1:37:09] hearing these words, it's it's for a
[1:37:11] purpose. We've got the ability to apply
[1:37:14] the token.
[1:37:16] Get it? and apply it. Get it. Identify
[1:37:20] yourself. Don't be afraid to get bloody
[1:37:22] hands. Don't be afraid to get a little
[1:37:25] bit out of order. Don't be afraid to
[1:37:27] say, "Lord, be it unto me, just like
[1:37:29] Mary. Let me experience this. I want to
[1:37:32] identify with that sacrifice. I don't
[1:37:34] want to identify with my own self. I've
[1:37:37] got nothing to offer. My good works are
[1:37:40] but filthy rags before you, Lord. Oh my.
[1:37:43] But that sacrifice that you made for me
[1:37:45] that was riding up on the ass of a fool
[1:37:48] up into Jerusalem where everybody
[1:37:49] thought they knew what they were doing
[1:37:51] but nobody recognized what was on the
[1:37:53] weight of that shoulders of Jesus
[1:37:56] Christ.
[1:37:58] My I think we all have the opportunity
[1:38:01] to answer this and I I just want to say
[1:38:03] it this way. What does Palm Sunday mean
[1:38:05] this year? I can say for me it means
[1:38:08] more than ever to recognize what truly
[1:38:11] took place when he was going up into
[1:38:14] Jerusalem. Nobody understood him. He was
[1:38:16] very misunderstood. And it's the same
[1:38:19] for us today. Nobody's going to
[1:38:20] understand us living in the world that
[1:38:22] we live in. You go to church two times a
[1:38:24] week. What? Why don't you cut your hair?
[1:38:27] Why do you wear a skirt? An abomination.
[1:38:30] Come
[1:38:31] on. And you know what? It's not even an
[1:38:33] abomination now for a man to live with a
[1:38:35] man, is it? In this world that we live
[1:38:38] in, it's just okay according to the word
[1:38:41] of God. It's not okay. That's right. And
[1:38:44] the people that might have the holiness
[1:38:46] revelation about being able to, you
[1:38:49] know, have some good works and go into
[1:38:51] church and stuff, maybe they need to
[1:38:53] remember that the word abomination
[1:38:54] applies to the men that lay with men and
[1:38:57] the women that lay with women and then
[1:38:59] the women that are willing to wear
[1:39:02] pants, the women that are willing to cut
[1:39:04] their hair, it's abomination. It's the
[1:39:06] same exact word.
[1:39:09] So where did it change?
[1:39:11] When did it become okay for women
[1:39:14] preachers? Boy, we're really going off
[1:39:17] now. But let's call it like it is. The
[1:39:20] prophet was sent every single time
[1:39:22] calling the people from the beginning of
[1:39:24] time right up until now. Get back to the
[1:39:27] word.
[1:39:29] Just get back in line with the word and
[1:39:30] it'll be okay. But we find the more
[1:39:34] people do things that are wrong that are
[1:39:37] are are are not according to the word of
[1:39:39] God, the more right it becomes. Is that
[1:39:41] right?
[1:39:43] What kind of world do we live in,
[1:39:44] brothers and sisters? Take a look at it.
[1:39:47] We can see that everyone is on the edge
[1:39:49] of their seat right now. They recognize
[1:39:51] something is energizing this world.
[1:39:54] Something is going to take place. And
[1:39:55] you know, we have the ability to
[1:39:57] recognize what's going to take place.
[1:39:58] Those people who have the atken applied
[1:40:01] the way that we've been told to do it
[1:40:03] are going to see him here. When we see
[1:40:05] him here, we're going to see him come in
[1:40:08] the clouds with glory. We not we're not
[1:40:10] going to miss it. In fact, I think just
[1:40:12] like the prophet said, we're going to
[1:40:13] see loved ones coming amongst us first
[1:40:16] for about 40 days. We're going to start
[1:40:17] wondering what's going on. Look it. We
[1:40:20] can see these people, these loved ones
[1:40:22] that have gone on before us and they're
[1:40:23] here to tell us just just take heart,
[1:40:26] brothers and sisters. Your redemption is
[1:40:28] here. It's not near. You don't have to
[1:40:30] worry. It's not coming soon. It's right
[1:40:32] here and now. But there's going to be
[1:40:34] other people they're saying, "Oh, they
[1:40:36] must be dying because they're talking to
[1:40:37] dead people. Look at them. They're
[1:40:38] crazy. I knew they were
[1:40:43] crazy." You know, you talk about the
[1:40:45] tent vision. I probably said this in the
[1:40:46] past. Talk about the tent vision. And
[1:40:49] some people might get uncomfortable with
[1:40:50] that and say, "Well, it's return
[1:40:51] ministry and all that." I just can't
[1:40:54] help but think if I started to see loved
[1:40:56] ones, I think somewhere someone along
[1:40:59] the way who is a believer, if they're
[1:41:00] seeing loved ones, too, they're not
[1:41:02] going to want to go to work. They're not
[1:41:04] going to want to go to school.
[1:41:06] Probably just going to want to go to
[1:41:08] church, aren't they? And how will all
[1:41:10] those people be able to fit into one
[1:41:12] building?
[1:41:13] I don't know. I'm just throwing it out
[1:41:16] there. I personally believe that we are
[1:41:18] that tent. We are that tent. But that's
[1:41:21] just my own view and I think it's a
[1:41:24] beautiful thing because there's lots of
[1:41:25] different avenues that we could go with
[1:41:27] that. But, you know, to think about it,
[1:41:28] brothers and sisters, if we're going to
[1:41:30] see dead loved ones coming on the scene
[1:41:32] again, we're going to see them. We're
[1:41:34] going to want to rejoice. I don't think
[1:41:36] we'll be able to sleep. I don't think
[1:41:37] we'll be able to eat. I don't know.
[1:41:39] Maybe we'll have the biggest fast and
[1:41:41] prayer meeting that we've ever
[1:41:42] experienced in our lives. And glory to
[1:41:44] God because we're going to go on to the
[1:41:45] marriage supper of the lamb. I would
[1:41:47] like to purge all of that food out of my
[1:41:49] body because I know I'm going to have a
[1:41:51] new glorious body. But isn't it
[1:41:53] wonderful to think about what lies in
[1:41:55] store for us? Eye hath not seen, neither
[1:41:57] ear heard, neither has it even entered
[1:41:59] into the heart of a man what lies in
[1:42:01] store for us. Oh my. But we had a
[1:42:03] prophet that went beyond the curtain of
[1:42:04] time and came back and said to us, it's
[1:42:07] sublime. You can't even put words to it.
[1:42:10] Men weren't men. Women weren't women.
[1:42:12] They were people to came together. They
[1:42:14] were brothers and sisters. But there was
[1:42:16] no
[1:42:17] sensation. Oh my, to think about that.
[1:42:20] And what did those people tell him as he
[1:42:22] was coming back? He was told, "Oh no, I
[1:42:24] don't want to go back. I don't have to
[1:42:25] go back, do I?" And the voice said,
[1:42:27] "Yes, you do. You've got to go prophesy
[1:42:30] before many peoples, nations, and
[1:42:32] tongues. You've got to go and do a
[1:42:34] little bit more work. You've got to go
[1:42:36] open the seals. You've got to be in your
[1:42:38] position at your post of duty so that
[1:42:40] people here in 2025 can recognize the
[1:42:43] gravity of Palm Sunday in Calgary,
[1:42:45] Alberta.
[1:42:48] But what did those people say to him?
[1:42:50] They just said, "Keep pressing on,
[1:42:51] brother." Oh my. I can't help but think
[1:42:53] about the loved ones that are over
[1:42:55] there. If they could look over the
[1:42:56] banisters of heaven, they'd say, "Keep
[1:42:58] pressing on. Don't get tired. Don't get
[1:43:00] weary and welloing. You're almost there.
[1:43:04] You're almost there.
[1:43:06] My, what does it mean to us today,
[1:43:08] brothers and sisters? What does Palm
[1:43:10] Sunday mean? Oh my. We know that less
[1:43:13] than a week after today, our savior,
[1:43:16] that Messiah that was on the back of the
[1:43:18] ass. Oh, that f of the ass. He was going
[1:43:22] up to be destroyed. His body was beaten
[1:43:26] to the place where they said, "Stop.
[1:43:29] You're going to kill him." Can you
[1:43:31] imagine the cat of nine tales? glass and
[1:43:34] bone, maybe bits of metal mixed in to
[1:43:38] those whips, thrown into his body and
[1:43:41] then yanked out, tearing flesh from him
[1:43:45] over and over again. Why? What did he
[1:43:48] say? What did he
[1:43:49] do? All he did was come and live and do
[1:43:54] his father's will.
[1:43:59] And then when he was too tore up on that
[1:44:03] back, what did they
[1:44:05] do? They undid him and flipped him over
[1:44:09] and started
[1:44:11] again ripping the flesh off his
[1:44:14] bones. When we think about it, it wasn't
[1:44:18] a fun thing.
[1:44:20] Easter is not about soft, fluffy Easter
[1:44:23] bunnies and chocolates. Easter is about
[1:44:25] the destruction of the flesh of our
[1:44:28] savior so that we could be here and live
[1:44:31] so that we could have the liberty to
[1:44:33] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:44:38] What does Palm Sunday mean to us today,
[1:44:40] brothers and sisters?
[1:44:42] our
[1:44:43] savior just
[1:44:45] destroyed so that we could live in
[1:44:48] freedom. So that we could have the
[1:44:50] freedom to come to Calgary living word
[1:44:52] and worship
[1:44:57] so that we could be free.
[1:44:59] Is it so that we could worship or so
[1:45:02] that we could just murmur? So that we
[1:45:04] could say, "Oh, it's just Brother Barry
[1:45:06] or it's just Brother so and so." All the
[1:45:09] junk that the devil wants to do. Let's
[1:45:11] kick him out. Let's recognize the
[1:45:14] gravity of Palm Sunday today.
[1:45:17] Let's recognize what he wants. He wants
[1:45:19] us to be together in one mind, in one
[1:45:22] accord. And we're not getting out of
[1:45:23] here until we're there.
[1:45:27] Let's throw down all of our problems,
[1:45:30] all of our issues.
[1:45:33] And just get into Christ.
[1:45:36] Let's apply that token maybe like never
[1:45:38] before.
[1:45:41] What does Palm Sunday mean to
[1:45:44] us? I can tell you it means more to me
[1:45:47] this year than ever
[1:45:49] before. Our savior was destroyed in his
[1:45:53] flesh. I've often thought about it. Why
[1:45:56] would he carry the cross after all of
[1:45:59] that? My goodness. And that was just the
[1:46:02] start of it. He was given the scarlet
[1:46:04] robe. Oh my. And then he was thrown in
[1:46:06] prison. And then they slapped him
[1:46:07] around, put a bag over his head, and
[1:46:09] said, "Oh, you're a prophet, are you?
[1:46:11] Tell us. Who hit you? Tell us." Oh, wait
[1:46:15] a second. He's a king. Let's get the
[1:46:17] crown of thorns and give him a crown
[1:46:19] because he's a king and beat the crown
[1:46:22] upon his
[1:46:23] head, totally humiliating him, spitting
[1:46:26] on him, tearing out his
[1:46:28] beard. And then when they took him up to
[1:46:31] crucify him, what did they do? They took
[1:46:32] that robe off of him, and it must have
[1:46:34] been soaked with blood. And as they tore
[1:46:36] it, it just peeled off the scabs and
[1:46:39] opened up the wounds
[1:46:41] again. What does what does Palm Sunday
[1:46:44] mean to us? This is what he went through
[1:46:47] so that we could be here today.
[1:46:50] So that we could have the freedom to
[1:46:52] worship him in spirit and in truth in
[1:46:54] this message of the hour.
[1:46:59] So that we could come to the place where
[1:47:00] we can say that I've met him personally
[1:47:02] myself.
[1:47:04] It's not about tradition. It's not about
[1:47:07] teaching. And if somebody were to come
[1:47:09] around and close those doors on this
[1:47:11] building here, then I would still love
[1:47:14] him just as much as I ever did. I I
[1:47:16] might even love him more. And I want to
[1:47:18] say this, brothers and sisters, if
[1:47:19] that's the case, then what about your
[1:47:21] brothers and your sisters? Because they
[1:47:23] have the Holy Ghost in them. They have
[1:47:25] the spirit of Christ in them. So, are we
[1:47:27] loving them the same? Would we desire to
[1:47:29] see them more? We've experienced it once
[1:47:31] with a pandemic where they shut the
[1:47:33] building down. They shut everything
[1:47:36] down. And what did we do? Oh my. I
[1:47:38] wanted to be with everyone. I wanted to
[1:47:41] see everyone and we
[1:47:44] couldn't. What does Palm Sunday mean to
[1:47:46] us today, brothers and
[1:47:49] sisters? You know, I just can't help but
[1:47:53] think there's one thing that I want to
[1:47:56] say. We saw Jesus in our scripture today
[1:48:00] coming into
[1:48:01] Jerusalem. He's going to come back to
[1:48:03] Jerusalem one day, isn't he? And you
[1:48:06] know, if you turn with me in your
[1:48:11] Bibles, we have the 23rd
[1:48:14] Psalm, the 23rd
[1:48:17] Psalm. We read it all the time. We
[1:48:20] memorize the 23rd
[1:48:22] Psalm. We recognize. But then there's
[1:48:25] the 24th Psalm.
[1:48:37] Psalm 24, the earth is the Lord's and
[1:48:41] the fullness
[1:48:43] thereof, the world and they that dwell
[1:48:48] therein. Why is that? Because he bought
[1:48:50] it. He created it. He allowed it to
[1:48:54] fall. And then he redeemed it. He bought
[1:48:58] it. For he hath founded it upon the
[1:49:02] seas, and established it upon the
[1:49:06] floods. Who shall
[1:49:09] ascend into the hill of the
[1:49:12] Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy
[1:49:16] place?
[1:49:18] He that hath clean hands and a pure
[1:49:21] heart, who hath not lifted up his soul
[1:49:24] unto
[1:49:25] vanity, nor sworn
[1:49:28] deceitfully, he shall receive the
[1:49:30] blessing of from the Lord and
[1:49:34] righteousness from the God of his
[1:49:37] salvation. I think this is just
[1:49:39] beautiful because this to me is speaking
[1:49:42] of the day in which we live. Any day
[1:49:44] now, there will be two prophets that
[1:49:47] emerge on the scene. And my view is I
[1:49:50] believe they're alive on earth already.
[1:49:52] They're very much alive on earth
[1:49:54] already. They may or may not know their
[1:49:56] calling, but they're alive on earth. And
[1:49:58] it will just take for them to actually
[1:50:00] be in their position for the spirit of
[1:50:02] God to come upon them and manifest the
[1:50:05] prophetic utterance. But this is the
[1:50:08] generation of them that seek him, that
[1:50:11] seek thy face, oh Jacob sailor. Lift up
[1:50:16] your heads, oh ye gates, and be ye
[1:50:19] lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the
[1:50:22] king of glory shall come in.
[1:50:25] I think this is so beautiful when we can
[1:50:27] say there is a dual meaning. There is a
[1:50:30] compound meaning and revelation for
[1:50:32] scripture. The same thing happens to a
[1:50:35] true believer. There comes a time where
[1:50:37] we can say just like brother Brandham
[1:50:39] said in that message. I was never the
[1:50:40] same after that because what did I do? I
[1:50:43] said lift up my head and open up the
[1:50:45] gates into my heart. There isn't going
[1:50:47] to be one secret room that I'm holding
[1:50:49] back. I'm going to say just come on in
[1:50:52] and be the Lord of glory. And you know
[1:50:54] what? That's about to take place in the
[1:50:55] land of Israel. And what happened was
[1:50:57] the Muslims, they went and bricked up
[1:50:59] those gates. They don't want no Nazarene
[1:51:01] coming back from the dead and walking
[1:51:03] through the eastern gate. But we know
[1:51:05] what's going to happen. We know he's
[1:51:07] going to go right through that gate.
[1:51:08] There isn't going to be nothing that
[1:51:09] will stop the King of glory from coming
[1:51:11] through those gates. In verse 7, it
[1:51:13] says, "Lift up your heads, oh ye gates,
[1:51:16] and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
[1:51:18] doors, and the King of glory shall come
[1:51:21] in." And they'll say, "Who is this King
[1:51:23] of glory? The Lord strong and mighty,
[1:51:26] the Lord mighty in battle."
[1:51:29] Lift up your heads, oh ye gates. even
[1:51:33] lift them up. Ye everlasting doors and
[1:51:36] the King of glory shall come in. All
[1:51:40] we've got to do is lift up the gates in
[1:51:42] our lives. Just lift those gates up and
[1:51:45] see if the King of glory won't come in.
[1:51:47] And everyone's going to say, "Who is
[1:51:48] this King of Glory again?" And we'll be
[1:51:50] able to say, "Oh, it's the Lord of
[1:51:52] hosts. He is the King of Glory." Say,
[1:51:56] "He's the King of Kings and Lord of
[1:51:58] Lords." And we can say with assurityity
[1:52:01] that he is my Lord. He has broken down
[1:52:05] every single
[1:52:07] wall. I'm going to call the musicians.
[1:52:10] Brothers and sisters, what does Palm
[1:52:12] Sunday mean to you today?
[1:52:15] 2025, the time the Savior rode up into
[1:52:17] the city so that he could be destroyed
[1:52:20] in the flesh for us. God richly bless
[1:52:23] you today. Maybe stand with me as we
[1:52:26] close.
[1:52:33] Gracious heavenly father, Lord
[1:52:35] Jesus, we thank you for what you've done
[1:52:38] for us,
[1:52:39] Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we're
[1:52:42] able to recognize your word in the day
[1:52:45] in which we
[1:52:47] live. Thank you, heavenly father, that
[1:52:50] Lord, we have ears to hear what your
[1:52:52] spirit says to the church.
[1:52:55] Father, we pray that Lord, if any of of
[1:52:59] us here, Lord, we need to know you and
[1:53:02] the power of your resurrection. If we
[1:53:04] just haven't had that time in our life
[1:53:05] where we can say that I know that my
[1:53:08] redeemer lives, Father, I pray that
[1:53:10] something special could happen today,
[1:53:12] Father, that you would just reveal
[1:53:14] yourself personally to the individual
[1:53:16] because we know that's what the new
[1:53:17] birth is. You told us that, Father. We
[1:53:21] ask Lord Jesus if anyone here today has
[1:53:24] grown just maybe a little bit weary, a
[1:53:27] little tired, a little cold in their
[1:53:30] experience. Father, Lord, we pray that
[1:53:32] we could just Lord raise our hands unto
[1:53:35] you and give you the opportunity to
[1:53:37] minister unto us, Father. Lord Jesus, we
[1:53:40] know we don't need to have an altar
[1:53:42] call, Father. Our hearts are the altar.
[1:53:44] And Lord Jesus, we know that altar is
[1:53:46] open right now. Father, we pray that you
[1:53:49] would just go from seat to seat, from
[1:53:51] heart to heart, ministering, Lord,
[1:53:53] bringing salvation and forgiveness, Lord
[1:53:56] Jesus, bringing healing, Lord Jesus, and
[1:53:59] restoration. Father, we know that you're
[1:54:01] able to give us all of those things.
[1:54:04] Father, there's a reason why you came to
[1:54:06] Calvary. The reason why you rode up into
[1:54:09] Jerusalem. Oh, Father, that you came so
[1:54:12] that we could be here today, Father. And
[1:54:15] Lord Jesus, help us not to waste it.
[1:54:17] Father, help us, Lord Jesus, not to take
[1:54:20] you for granted. Lord, oh Lord Jesus, we
[1:54:23] know that you, your spirit will not
[1:54:25] always strive with man. Father, the days
[1:54:29] are growing short. I pray that, Father,
[1:54:32] somehow someway something was said
[1:54:34] today, Father, that would just make a
[1:54:36] difference in someone's life. Lord
[1:54:38] Jesus, we pray that you would just
[1:54:40] receive the glory now as we sing a
[1:54:42] couple songs unto you, Father. That you
[1:54:45] would be
[1:54:46] glorified. Be with those who couldn't be
[1:54:48] here today, Father. Wherever they are,
[1:54:50] Lord, maybe working or traveling,
[1:54:53] Father, maybe at home because they're
[1:54:55] sick, Lord. Father, whatever it is,
[1:54:57] wherever they are, we know that you're
[1:54:59] more than able to minister unto them,
[1:55:01] Father. Maybe those who are streaming
[1:55:03] today, Father. Those who would watch
[1:55:05] later, Lord. Father, you're not bound by
[1:55:07] time or space. Lord, be there, Lord,
[1:55:09] too, Father, we pray. Oh, we love you
[1:55:12] and thank you. We just commit each life
[1:55:14] into your hands now. Father, as we go
[1:55:17] our separate ways, in Jesus Christ's
[1:55:19] name we
[1:55:21] pray.
[1:55:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:35] We have a prayer request here. I
[1:55:37] apologize from sister
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:41] kindness. She's looking for complete
[1:55:44] healing in her legs and body.
[1:55:49] We also would just like to welcome
[1:55:51] sister
[1:55:52] Salamantu and
[1:55:54] brother her
[1:55:56] son back with us again from
[1:55:59] Africa. God richly bless
[1:56:03] you. Let's just bow again. Gracious
[1:56:07] heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:56:09] you for your goodness.
[1:56:11] We just pray for sister kindness, Lord,
[1:56:14] that according to her words, according
[1:56:17] to her request, Father, that you would
[1:56:18] meet the need, that you would take away
[1:56:20] the pain in the name of
[1:56:22] Jesus. Father, we know that you're more
[1:56:24] than able. And we just unite together
[1:56:27] more than ever, Father. And we rebuke
[1:56:28] that devil in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:56:30] that would try and come against your
[1:56:33] daughter. And we proclaim the glorious
[1:56:36] liberty of our Lord.
[1:56:39] Thank you for bringing sister Salaman 2
[1:56:42] back to us and her son Ezekiel. Father,
[1:56:44] we pray that you would continue to bless
[1:56:46] them as well. Bless each one abundantly.
[1:56:49] Father, in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:56:51] pray.
[1:56:54] Amen. Can we sing that song? Here I am
[1:56:58] to
[1:57:01] worship. Here I am to worship.
[1:57:09] Light of the world, you step down into
[1:57:17] darkness. Open my eyes. Let me
[1:57:25] see.
[1:57:27] Beauty that
[1:57:29] made my
[1:57:31] heart adore you.
[1:57:35] Hope of a life spent with
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:45] you. Here I am to
[1:57:49] worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I
[1:57:55] am to say that you're my
[1:58:01] God. Your
[1:58:07] You're all
[1:58:11] together. All
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:21] together. King of
[1:58:25] all so mighty.
[1:58:31] Glorious in

[1:59:32] Amen.
[1:59:34] Can we change the tempo this morning?
[1:59:36] Can we sing hosana?
[1:59:39] I just think that would be so
[1:59:40] appropriate.
[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:49] Hosana. Blessed be the
