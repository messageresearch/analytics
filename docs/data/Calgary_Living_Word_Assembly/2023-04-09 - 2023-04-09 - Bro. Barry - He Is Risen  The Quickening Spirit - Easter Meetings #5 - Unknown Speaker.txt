Calvary Lord Jesus or a group of people Lord that you were willing to condescend from your throne to the lowest estate of a human being born in a hybrid condition father to be humiliated to be spit on to have your beard torn out to be buffeted to be mocked or Jesus to be whipped to be belittled to have that mockery Crown of Thorns put on your head and then to lay your life down so that we could be

careful to give you all the praise just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen a man God bless you this morning thank you musicians the turn with me in your Bible to Matthew 28. I'd just like to welcome our visitors with us certainly in honor and a privilege to have you here sister Adina akuen his brother Cyrus's sister welcome sister [Applause] just like to read from Matthew chapter 28. verses 1 2 7. very familiar scripture in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week as brother Emmanuel brought last night the three days and three nights in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did Shake and become became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women notice he didn't say it to the guards he said it to the female fear not fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay come and see the proof and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told you let's turn over to Romans chapter 8. exactly where the Gilbert started Romans 8 11. very familiar scripture once again but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this word we thank you for the mechanics and Lord Jesus we thank you for the Dynamics because we know that this word is just word in print form but when the Dynamics comes father that changes everything we know that that Dynamics is the quickening spirit that this word speaks of father and we welcome it this morning and we welcome it not as an inanimate object but we welcome that Spirit as the person of Jesus Christ father you told us last night that you would have a manifestation in flesh once again on Earth before the Rapture of the church and we just accept it the way that you've brought it to us father and we just ask that you would take this quickening spirit this morning Father and Quicken this word to our very Souls Lord father that it would come from the very soul out into our very Spirit Lord that it would begin to consume our spirits and our our emotions that are on the innermost Spirit of the humans that are here father and that it would begin to manifest in our bodies Lord Jesus on the body uh father all of our our emotions in our bodies Lord the way that we think father the thoughts that come into our mind that it would change the the way we behave towards those thoughts Lord Jesus that that quickening Spirit wouldn't be an ointment on the on the top of our skin that we would just apply from the outside Lord but that quickening Spirit Lord Jesus let it come from the very inside Lord that teeny little space that you made in the heart of a man father that it would change our bodies from glory to glory we just invite that quickening Spirit now you yourself Lord Jesus have the preeminence now in our service Lord in our thoughts and in our hearts father we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I don't have any announcements this morning other than I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for the week of meetings here it certainly has been an encouragement to me if for nobody else I have been thoroughly thoroughly thrilled we certainly miss those who are traveling but we know that uh they're just having fun they're doing what they do some of them are in Edmonton this week I know brother Justice in the family went to Edmonton to Fellowship brother Toby is actually taking the service right now for brother Sig Clark and uh brother Daniel and sister Christy I understand went with them as well just to fellowship with them God bless you Sister Jermaine it's so good to see you certainly a pleasure to see our brothers and our sisters when we don't get to see them all the time but here we are this morning and and it's just a beautiful morning this morning when I I woke up I it was way before daylight and I I just I thought I wonder what it was like the moment that Jesus opened his eyes in the Tomb what was that moment like because I can guarantee all the devils in hell we're watching they were watching intently as were all of the angels in heaven they were watching intently they knew the Angels knew what was going to happen but the Devils those Fallen Angels they didn't know but boy oh boy when those eyes opened they must have gasped they must have had a heart attack a heart failure just like Rahab told the two spies that you know our hearts melt within us when we hear about your God all the devils in Hell their their hearts must have just melted when his eyes opened that very instant when that quickening power came upon him I don't want to get too far into it yet this morning but I'm just certainly thankful for the ministering brethren in the congregation and I'm sorry brother Paul and brother Joshua brother Jose I I wanted to have a spot for everyone but it just didn't work out and we'll make sure that we find a spot for you both as well but uh we know our hearts are together we're not Divided We believe the same message of the hour and and we just trust that the Lord is working things out for his glory and uh it just was a wonderful week and I'm just gonna maybe do a little bit of a recap I can't help but talk about it a little bit you know how brother Gilbert brought it from Romans 8 11 about this this this Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies I've just been tumbling this around in my mind and in my heart for some time well before the Easter meetings because it was a very scripture I was going to use brother Bradham uses it in the Easter seal he preached that just before he preached uh it is the rising of the Sun a 1965 both of those sermons he uses Romans 8 11. it's about the quickening power the spirit of Jesus Christ that's the quickening power and it will Quicken our mortal bodies but what I've been been really dwelling on is it's not that it's quickening our mortal bodies to to say that we're just gonna have maybe the spirit enter into a service and it's going to Quicken our bodies and we're just going to praise God in a in a greater way or or we're going to maybe do more for the body of Christ because our bodies have been quickened it's not just that it's going to get us out of the Grave one day it's going to Quicken our mortal bodies that will have a theophany body really what this word is saying is that it's going to Quicken our mortal bodies this Flesh on the outside and the spirit on the inside is going to Quicken both of those to the word of God for our day it's going to take the bodies and cause us to become subject to that word if we have the quickening power and that quickening power brothers and sisters is the Holy Ghost that's why I can't say it enough and everyone who preaches will always say it as well we have got to have the Holy Ghost in our life but outside of a man that God would send to tell us how to come out of denominational tradition how else would we ever know how to get the true Holy Ghost anointing in our lives and not just an anointing on the flesh as we said not an anointing in the spirit but an anointing in our soul to get that token brother Branham says it that if we have that token we have the right to every single promise in the word that's where the word becomes quickened my but you know there's Spectators and there's players I love how brother Gilbert brought that it's pretty straight but you know we live in an age where it's not time to play church it's time to talk straight let let good be good let bad be bad it's going to be what it's going to be and those people who want to play will play they'll jump in the game and if someone is on the sideline today saying I don't know whether I should jump in or not try jumping in try it once jump one time brother Branham said about that story of the eagle just flap your wings one time and see if God won't actually meet you there but it's time to jump in the game the whole entire world is playing their game Satan's playing his game and you know what I'll say this he ain't playing he ain't playing he wants to destroy every single one of us and if we've got that quickening power inside of us he can't touch us and and if he can touch us it's only because he's been given permission to do so so that we could be perfected if we have a trial in our life the word says to rejoice in the midst of our trial because our trial is worth more than the best finest gold than we could ever get because it's going to perfect us we got Spectators and players why you know I heard this and I just think it's wonderful I'm gonna I'm gonna say it brother Bradham he he asked this gets asked this question and questions and answers and it's beautiful because you know how we have so many different ideas and traditions brother Emmanuel hit on it last night how we can have a quote and spin it to fit our lives to suit our needs and and make us Believers still of this message of the hour but yet bend the way the word says to do it brother Branham says just speak the word the way the word says it you don't have to interpret the word god interprets his own word you don't have to try and make it suit you but here brother Adam he's asked this question do you teach the bride must not attend any other Church unless you are preaching preaching or else otherwise the Tabernacle can you imagine that yeah that's that's that's the spirits that we're around and you know what Spirits don't die they're alive and well today [Applause] even around this message that's why it would be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible brother branham's answer he says no exclamation mark I don't teach that I don't believe that I do not believe it we've got ministers setting here that's scattered all around through the country and I just want to say we've got ministers sitting around that's scattered all around through the congregation right through the country and I believe that they are part of that bride I believe that a man or woman can go to church anywhere they want to go that teaches the word it's beautiful but he goes further with it doesn't just stop there I think it's so wonderful he says and I believe if they don't teach the whole word you should just stay at home and stream no that ain't what he says I'm just wanting to see if you're listening he says and I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to a church any other place where they teach the whole word go where they teach half the word until you can get to where they teach the whole word he says go to church whatever you do do that I want to say like brother Emmanuel said if there's someone saying you can be a pastor and you can just have an online Ministry I don't have to have a congregation I can have a virtual congregation or you could just stay home and stream brothers and sisters that's a lie of the devil that's a wolf and sheep's clothing La he's lying to you go to church the prophet of God said go to church don't sit at home go to church and I think it's beautiful it took me a little bit of learning but hey you know what I I know that God called me for however long he's called me if if brother Barry doesn't suit your fancy don't worry just go to church just go to church because you don't come to worship brother Barry you want to go worship God and I think it's wonderful we could go to a Pentecostal Church as a believer of this message of the hour and still be blessed and I believe that we could bring a blessing to that church I believe that's possible now I'm not saying stop coming here I'm not saying that I'm saying go or you can be fed go you can be fed it took me a little bit to get used to it some people left immediately when I came in here some people left after you know what it's God's doing it's God's people just go to church don't go home if you're staying home something's wrong I just thought it was beautiful the the idea of of players and Spectators we don't want to be Spectators this is no time to be a spectator because what we're going to watch is the rapture go and we're going to say wasn't a lie supposed to come wasn't are we supposed to have a third pull Ministry wasn't Lim supposed to be restored wasn't there all this different stuff supposed to happen no it ain't going to be the way we maybe think it's going to be we heard about it last night there's going to be a manifestation in flesh but brothers and sisters like I've said so many times take a look around this is it right here the Believers in Christ the bride age Revival is on right now people are looking for a great tremendous Revival I heard them talking about it in a in a in a interdenominational meeting they were saying oh the Revival and they were talking about the Revival and how there's going to be a Revival and there was just a Revival and there's coming a Revival and I was thinking my prophet of God has said the Revival's already happened and they missed it and now they're crying for oil oh my goodness what does that mean we know what that means as Believers of this day you know that was that was that was Wednesday what a tremendous message it was then we went on to the the greatest battle ever fought was in Gethsemane I'm sorry I need to get going here and you know we have part of our mind that's in our brain but we have part of our mind that's in our heart because as a man thinketh in his heart who thinks with their heart nobody thinks with their heart according to science but the word of God says we do there's a part that we know of that we can see potentially but then there's a part that we just can't see it's that inner man and that's that quickening Spirit we're talking about you know our body or our spirit we we don't want either one of those the body or the spirit to control us we we want to actually control them and excuse me when that quickening Spirit comes in brothers and sisters it's not like we have to try and do it it just happens just like sheep make wool just like doves are white there's just something on the inside of the inside that Babbling Brook brother batam talked about it just keeps pushing out what keeps you so happy Brooke it's just something on the inside of the inside that just keeps bubbling up we can't control it it's the Lord and you know brother Bradham he talked about that we heard that quote you know what if you're one of those those those people that's just used to have in your own way one of those Childs that's just a little brat maybe growing up into a grown man that's just used to having your own way all the time and you find it's always a problem maybe just try doing the opposite just just change the direction if you're used to having everything coming to you maybe start giving it away don't don't do what you've always done if you always do what you've always done you're only going to get what you whoever God but if you want to see more of God in your life there's more of God to have just take the Versa is what brother Bradham says the vice versa just do the opposite and Watch What Happens you know brother Bradham he said that we heard that quote he says that's the way to overcome anything do the opposite we talked about this a while ago I don't know how long ago a long time ago sometimes we can have a problem in our life and we can just simply say I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you and we'll continually do that brother badam talks about it it's like seeing a rattlesnake you can see the rattlesnake there and he's got his tail rattling and as long as you stand there and you rebuke him he's going to keep his tail rattling and he could bite you but if you just say I rebuke you and turn around and walk away he's got no power over you he can't touch you that's what we need to do in our lives when we have problems if there's an issue we just need to walk away from it just move forwards keep walking and we heard about how you and I the bride is Christ's Victory there's five musts that we must do brother Mervin and three must Nots you know we've had so many mechanics so much mechanics bye how about some Dynamics brothers and sisters let's let's put some Dynamics into the mechanics now we've got a well-oiled machine we understand how to have church and we understand the message of the hour we understand all of the Mysteries now let's just let Christ come that that quickening spirit and Quicken this word to our very Souls my goodness and you know when we get those two together we become Justified [Laughter] because it's not us doing it is it such a beautiful beautiful ending to that message wasn't it how how that servant could not have left the garden with his ear on the ground or in his hand or in his pocket or someone carrying that ear because then there would have been a witness about them being bad about them being evil but Jesus said no no no no that's not the way this is going to go down put your sword up Peter because if you live by the sword you're going to die by the sword but man's only going to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it's not going to be the sword in your pocket it's going to be the sword of the word you know my looking in the uh the Easter seal oh my goodness I just think it's beautiful I'm not going to get into that yet I want to talk about brother Emanuel I just have some some of my notes uh that I was planning are quite like what brother Emmanuel was bringing last night and it's just the continuity of the of the spirit we had the discussions early on brothers and sisters are you going to announce who is going to actually preach and I said no I'm not going to announce who's going to preach when and the reason for that is I don't want to have assumptions I don't want us to be saying I'm going to maybe come because my favorite minister is going to preach or whatever I just want to see who is going to come and what's going to happen we'll get together as a body of Believers and just have church and then what are we going to talk about I don't want to talk about that I just want to see the continuity of the spirit I want to see the Lord move in every single service and you know from the very beginning right to the very end it's just exactly where I was anticipating we would go with it he has risen but not just 2 000 years ago right now today in our very lives through the understanding of the message of the hour he's identified by his deeds that's what we heard about last night and you know if you can't believe me just believe the works that I do because they are what testifies of me and you know how does that apply to us do we have many signs and wonders no we don't necessarily have many signs and wonders but can you believe the word remember what the greatest Miracle is the ability to be turned from a filthy pig a human being that's a beast with a beast nature into a into a lamb of God into a son or daughter of God to actually receive the new birth that's the greatest Miracle ever we don't be looking for signs and wonders we want to see that quickening Spirit come to life in our life and that's when we'll be a real husband to our wives that's when we'll be a real wife to our husbands and children to our parents and brothers to our sisters that's when that quickening spirit will come in our lives but he's identified by his deeds and our lives speak volumes we don't even have to talk many times Our Lives speak volumes and sometimes it's just as simple as the you know we can we can be doing things and maybe somebody will do something and and we have a situation where we can make it better or or we could benefit by not doing anything and not saying anything as a Believer we want to make it better we want to see the person not not come up short we don't want to have people in in a situation maybe done wrong in a business deal or what have you we want to demonstrate the Life of Christ we were talking about it yesterday because really whose money do we have and when we're talking about money specifically we'll go there whose money do we have we've got God's money we don't just give him his 10 percent we keep his 90 percent he gives us his 90 percent all of it is his money the only reason we have any money is because he gave it to us my goodness you know uh out of the Easter seal brother Bradham talks about how that seal was broken and that's that's where I want to get into this morning here I certainly thank the brethren for the for the efforts for the labors knowing that we're we're holding down jobs and and coming and having Church like this what a tremendous blessing it's been though and like I said yesterday I think it was we might not see the results from this for weeks months years maybe even decades we don't know but we might be blessed tomorrow we we don't know what tomorrow has in store it could be a prayer from today that changes our life tomorrow we don't know in the Easter seal brother Branham he says but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and the life the secret was made known that seal was open and isn't it wonderful brothers and sisters that that seal has been open in our day that seal that that that thing that had been hidden that he was both the resurrection and the life has been opened he goes on to say and he said when he come forth on that morning because I live you live also Not only was he the beneficiary of the Resurrection but all those seed that was resting in God's Great promise was a benefactor of that Resurrection to life because he said because I live ye shall live also and that was the breaking of the seal because he brought up so will everyone that's in Christ be brought up with him I heard something in a discussion this week that I thought was real interesting they said that there was a tomb of prophets that was opened in the 40s in Israel they found and they said that it was a tomb where prophets were and I'm not sure who the prophets were exactly but when they opened it they said what'd you find in the Tomb they said nothing it was empty and and they said why is that and someone said well when Jesus came forward many of the saints that slept in the graves came with him their tombs were empty also what a tremendous thought but we which are alive and remain oh my until the coming of the lord we know there's a promise coming brothers and sisters it's never been closer that promise is here and we have the ability to be the benefactors also as we just read because we are that seed and anyone who can hear this word actually is that seed if we can't hear this word then maybe we're not that seed and you know as we heard last night just because somebody can't hear today doesn't mean they won't be able to hear it tomorrow the key to it is as Believers is to not put anybody in or put anybody out because one day we're going to answer for it we're going to be the ones that are going to answer we'll stand before God and he'll say why did you treat that brother or that sister that way it's up to him to judge I certainly enjoyed the the services this week and I know that I've truly been blessed thank you everyone for your efforts all the song specials the the music all of the talent we have here is just tremendous certainly thankful for it you know uh talking about the quickening spirit second Corinthians 1 verse 22 who hath also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts that quickening Spirit the Lord Jesus Christ the one who came and died and rose again he hath given us that quickening Spirit but you know it's the earnest it is the down payment brother Branham said of that Resurrection it's the proof and this is where I'm going to start to weave in brother Emmanuel I just thought it was so wonderful you know what nowadays when we see a Salesman they don't just actually come and try and tell you about their product they give you a sample of your product if you go to Costco and you walk through some people go to Costco just for the samples but you know brothers and sisters we've been given the sample the earnest or down payment of the life this resurrection that we talk about this quickening spirit I think it's just absolutely tremendous let's go back in our Bibles here just talking about our scripture in Matthew 28. just go backwards into Matthew 27. just after Jesus crucifixion his death and now his burial in the midst of it verse 62 of Matthew 27. according to what brother Emmanuel brought last night now here we go now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together unto Pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again command therefore that the Sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last Heir shall be worse than the first and pilate said unto him ye have a watch go your way make it sure as he can so they went and made the Sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch now I can't help but think that was just anointed last night where we had man put a stone in the way of man's access to Jesus and we had man Desiring through the government to put a seal upon that stone to completely make it sure but isn't it wonderful that pilate he had the wisdom to say make it sure as you can because you're not going to be able to keep it you're not going to be able to stop it but go ahead and try I'll give you some servants some soldiers I'll give you maybe the Signet to go and put a wax seal on it you can go and make it sure as you can go ahead and try it but we know he couldn't keep it we know that it didn't happen that way but the point I want to get to here is verse 63 specifically we know that they they came to him saying sir we remember that that deceiver said can you imagine that brothers and sisters here we are once again the infidels the ones who don't believe believing though his disciples said that it was as Idol Tales when she came back and said he's risen he's already risen here we have those people who put him on the cross saying oh my we recognize remember this guy this Deceiver the most religious people hey understanding that there's something behind that word for their day understanding that something could happen we better make it sure as we can right let's go and put a rock in the way let's go and try and unveil them let's go and try and hide this from man because if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church they'll become an invincible Army Satan won't be able to touch him the Gates of Hell will not be able to Prevail against that rock of Revelation that they actually receive when that angel rolls that stone away but isn't it wonderful brothers and sisters what happened in our day an angel messenger came and actually broke open that stone for us and now we're talking about it word wise but here we have it physical this was physical with Jesus in the grave who was God but we know that it wasn't man that opened that stone man is the one that tried to block the way man is the one that tried to get into the way of keeping man from being able to see Jesus but the angel of the Lord came and said no not so you're going to roll this Stone back and what happened there was a magnificent earthquake he's the same yesterday today and forever what happened when brother Branham was here and he threw that stone up in the air and he said get under something quick he was talking about something very specific there it wasn't just take cover under a tree get under an anointing get under the word for your day because there's coming a judgment on this Earth and what happened Good Friday 1964 65 63 when was it somebody probably knows Alaska almost sunk it was Good Friday it was the largest earthquake to ever strike North America in recent history he's the same yesterday today and forever I can't help but think that there was an angel rolling away a stone pulling back some Revelation opening it up to the people to say you know what there's something in store for you just keep pressing on you know talking about this uh I just think it's beautiful talking about this this this setting the stone there and and we know that they set a watch on it and and to make it as sure as you can they went to verse 66 says so they went and made the Sepulcher sure they went to make it sure sealing the stone and setting a watch think about that how they sealed that stone I I I just did something to me I looked it up sealed in in g49 72 is is is the word sealed and there's two forms of sealed in the Bible that I was able to see g4972 is the one that's used the most commonly and that is to stamp with a Signet or private mark for security preservation literally or figuratively by implication to keep Secret to attest set at and seal up and isn't it an amazing thing to think that here we have men trying to do that very thing but we've read in second Corinthians 1 22 who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts it's the same word sealed trying to close it up but there's another sealed in the word in Revelation and that's the only other place that I could see it in Revelation and it's to seal closely in it's Revelations chapter 5 when he had loosed those seals when he was opening the seals creating the Revelation making the way for us to see what's actually on the inside of the inside to seal closely I just think it's a wonderful thing to look at this story here you know it wasn't very long before this if we turn over in our Bibles this morning just another scripture here in in John kind of picking up where where we left off before we talked about Lazarus and and I believe it was I don't know I'm not gonna pretend I can't remember we talked about this a little while ago maybe last Sunday or the Sunday before talking about The Story of Lazarus and and how they they they knew that Jesus could have prevented this from happening but we know Jesus knowing all things we know the story we're not going to go back and read it all but I just want to pick up in in the midst of the story where Jesus finally comes Lazarus is already dead he was God he knew what was going to happen he he didn't come on purpose when he was called for a reason he wanted to show them something he wanted to show them who he truly was but in Saint John 11 Saint John 11 verse 21. Jesus had finally come then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died we heard that beautiful special four days late I think that's what it was four days late many times we look at our lives and we have prayer and we have needs and their desperate needs and we would say that Jesus is four days late he doesn't come right when we say that we need him we know that we need to have an answer in prayer and he just doesn't come when we see it but we know that that's exactly the way it's supposed to be all things work together for the good so those who are called according to his purpose they don't always work together for the good verse 22 but I know that even now whatsoever thou Wilt ask of God God will give it thee so she didn't even realize that he was God yet she was talking to him as the second person God was another person to her Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day of course it's going to happen we know that's what's going to happen that's what we've been taught our entire lives Jesus saith unto her verse 25 I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and we know we left off with this believeth thou this and that was the message we had uh we had read from but if we could just drop down to verse 39 the same chapter we know that there was a discussion Jesus wept and we know people have said well how could God be God and weep we know that Jesus was all God and He was all man that's just the way it is verse 39 says Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days Jesus saith unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldst see the glory of God not the glory of Jesus but the glory of God then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and I knew that thou heardst me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go now we know that this was God very God standing there in flesh calling him out of the Grave out of the Tomb calling him back maybe from from the regions Beyond from Paradise calling his soul his Spirit right back into him and when he came out of that tomb he was bound hand in foot and he had a napkin over his face and we've heard many different depictions of this but isn't it interesting Jesus said lose him immediately lose him but who was there to lose Jesus he didn't need loosing he was that quickening spirit in fact he actually took that grave cloth and folded it and laid it down to say the work is complete we heard brother Wayne talk about that one time The Carpenter's job when he worked in in Israel in those days when he was done he would wash himself and he would dry his hands and he would fold the napkin and lay it down and that was actually the proof that the work was finished it's a beautiful thing out of it's the rising of the sun brother Branham says that God knows Hallelujah he's got a predestinated four ordained Church he note he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere and when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over it that wave Chief oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how man tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an ego was he's talking about the eagle the Eagle's egg being hatched under a hen but the Branham called it setting a hen putting the eagle egg under a hen and having an eagle hatch with chickens and being in the chicken yard and and raising up and not knowing that he's an eagle he looks at the chickens and he thinks that's the way he looks nobody ever put a mirror in front of him but he always felt a little bit different brother Brown's talking about that no matter how man tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an ego was and yet he was an eagle he would not understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and I just think this is so beautiful this is where it really starts to go like this with the message last night because we know him by his deeds we know him by the life we live how will the world know that we love him brothers and sisters not because we say we do the world's gonna say everyone says they love him the Catholic church say they love him and how many people did they put to death over the years in the name of God my goodness how will the how will the world know that we we love him we've got love one for another we're not divided we don't have divisions and camps and all of that business we don't do that not believers he says no matter how man tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an ego was and yet he was an eagle he would not understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a PhD not an lld not a good neighbor but a Son of God molded in the image of God with a dynamic power of God to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no head that's going to hold you and you know brothers and sisters I want to say this here I want to interject this here I'm not saying what he said but what I do want to interject here is to Simply say this we're not talking about being quickened to the to the to the first and second polls to having a great manifestation of signs and wonders I'm just going to keep underlying this we're being quick into the word we're being quickened to say Amen to the word and not just to say Amen to the word but to actually reflect the word that's what brother Matt I'm saying there we're able to reflect that word to the world around us when I see you I see an eagle when I see you I see the word when I see you I see Jesus Christ I don't see my brothers Badger skin I don't see the the infirmities in your flesh I don't see the the maybe the temperament and different things that you have if somebody says something bad about us we just say you know I don't think he meant that brother Branham he said they said about him you wouldn't know his friends from his enemies we don't talk bad about each other we don't slag each other you know people might not hear us and that's fine but God does God hears us our thoughts even are louder in heaven then our words he says he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen that's going to hold you the eagle he says he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word and that's what we're talking about today brothers and sisters not just being a spectator and watching the Eagles Fly and saying my look at those Eagles those Eagles are beautiful they're so Majestic and they can fly so high they can go fast they're the biggest predators on the in the world they can do this and they can do that there's so many different varieties and types of them and maybe we have all the different stats on all the different players of eagles you know it's not going to do us any good what we got to do is jump we got to flap our wings one time we've got to raise our hands and jump up and down and praise the Lord and say thank you Lord for redeeming me for giving me the ability to receive your word in my day it says he's an eagle an eagle a word before the foundation of the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position that sounds like a a mouthful it's kind of confusing but I'll say it like this brothers and sisters if you're in him now if he's in you now then you were with him at Calvary and we've already heard that this week you are not going to be here now without have being there on Calvary and if you were there on Calvary then you were with him before the foundation of the world and if you've been there before the foundation of the world then what it is it's the word being spoken by a Vindicated Prophet God's word echoing through a prophet into the ears of a son and daughter of God that doesn't understand who they are as a baby eagle they've been raised in a chicken pen and there's chickens all around they don't understand who they are but something sounds different about that word that they've heard and it quickens that word seed Gene of God inside of them to say Amen to that word I don't understand egos I don't understand the message or the seals or the Mysteries I don't understand any of that but there's something about that word just like Hattie Wright said with the third poll I don't understand it but there's something about that word that ain't nothing but the truth brother Branham talking about squirrels speaking squirrels into existence and we heard it last night he didn't say thus saith the Lord that squirrel is going to come out this way he just simply said that squirrel is going to come out this way who does that God is the only one that does that but it wasn't brother Branham being God it's not Christ Branham it's God in brother Branham and the same God that was in brother Branham is in you today that's the quickening spirit in Romans 8 11 that we're talking about brothers and sisters it's not some other person don't look for another person look for Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to live out through us it's the word to the word the word predestinated from before the foundation of the world predestinated to the word written for the hour not some other hour I love how brother Mervin said it it's the message of the hour I got about 18 minutes left the message of the hour we only want to keep it to be an hour but one of these days maybe it'll just continue on you know I I can't help but think that one day maybe we'll start to see loved ones maybe we'll have 30 about 30 to 40 days you know there will be maybe that will happen and I I I'll say this I'll take all my resources brothers and sisters and I'll throw caution to the wind and I'll get a tent big enough to fit as many people that want to come to it maybe it sounds fundamentally crazy but hey you know what I'm only going to want to have church I'm only going to want to praise God I'm only going to want to shake the hands of all those Believers that we start to see all around I'm not going to be interested in going to do the things that I want to do but you know that's that's never been closer brothers and sisters it's never been closer that many of the Saints who slept will be seen in the city we could start seeing loved ones and and I would say we're not just could start seeing loved ones we will start seeing loved ones and I don't know about you but I've heard of a bunch of different people who have had dreams about people the past loved ones who have gone on before us and how Vivid the dreams are about about what they're wearing about what they say about how they say it I've heard many accounts of that in the last probably decade of loved ones who have gone on I believe it's for a purpose brothers and sisters we know the word of God says that the old men will dream dreams and the young men will see Visions that's not too far off the truth that's the word of God and we should be able to hear that stuff without being freaked out about it oh my that that brother is getting a little bit fundamental for me you know what brother Bradham talks about there's two two types of people in this world he said he traveled the whole world and he said there's the fundamentals they understand all the word and I would say we could bring it right down to where we live brothers and sisters and we'll say there's a fundamental message believers they know all the quotes they understand the church age book they they could quote quotes up and down inside and out they know it all they've got a perfect record with church a perfect life everything is fundamental with them but they're cold informal and Powerless brother Branham talks about the other ones who are the Pentecostals the Pentecostals boy oh boy they like to get down they like to praise God they love to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ but you know what the the morals aren't there they don't have the fundamentals down maybe the women wear pants and and they have cut hair and and boy oh boy can they sing like Angels they can do all manner of goodness they can they can really really worship God they have the power of God maybe they speak in tongues and they interpret in their services they see the mighty moving of God but they don't have the faith to activate it brother Branham talks about it how the fundamentals and the Pentecostals if you could just get those two together one time if you could just bring them together one time it would be like the the man who's got a checkbook but but can write a check but he's got no money in the bank but then you've got someone who's got a bank account that's so full he could never spend at all but he doesn't have a checkbook or he has a checkbook and he just doesn't know how to write the check maybe he's illiterate but boy if you could get someone who could write that check for that account that knows that God will actually pay that bill my goodness what would happen but that's the word that we're lit that's what the world that we're living in brothers and sisters this world is falling apart all around us but as this world falls apart and we know all of these different groups and movements they gain strength and they gain momentum and they're they're growing into positions where it can be pretty scary for us as Believers to look around and think this is the world that we live in but goodness sakes what's happening to the Bride of Jesus Christ the devil wants us to think nothing's happening to the bride the bride is just just just being suppressed and she's going to be squished into a corner and one day she's going to have to have the third pole manifestation and nothing's happening but I'll tell you that's a lie of the devil the bride is in the midst of the greatest Revival that she's ever had she knows that her time is short she knows that the resurrection and Rapture is at hand this is about the word to the word the word that was predestinated from before the foundation of the world to be spoken through a Vindicated Prophet to the word see Gene of God inside the heart of the believer to say Amen to that word and what happened is when that happens you come forth from the grave just like Lazarus we know that brother Bradham said very clearly that he had to say Lazarus he didn't say just come forth with a loud voice he didn't put his shoulders back the way he said that and say come forth because if he did that knowing who he was the General Resurrection would have happened but he had to call him by name and isn't it wonderful to think brothers and sisters that he's still calling by name he's still doing it and when he does you come forth from that grave that you were in that Sepulcher that you were Bound in Traditions and ideas and teachings and you say be it unto me according to Thy word I'm not interested in what my forefathers did I'm not interested in my brothers and sisters I want to see them all saved but I'm only interested in what God's showing me right now my goodness think about that in Lazarus life in the sisters where we're saying Jesus if you would only have been here and he said you know what I came to tell you that I I didn't I tell you that you would see the power of God the manifestation of God my and then he said the distinctive words I am same words he said to Moses same words he said all over the place in the Bible I am I am the resurrection and the life who could say those words oh my goodness my goodness I believe that we could get into our text now start preaching goodness you know I just can't help but think how that angel came in in in our scripture this morning that we read in Matthew chapter 28. that angel came and rolled away the stone Jesus told the people the same thing in The Story of Lazarus he said roll away the stone walked up to it and and said roll away the stone I can't help but think that he said the same exact words to the angels roll away that stone and the angel came down from heaven and rolled that stone away and isn't it wonderful to think that we have had that same thing happen in our day we've had an angel come down an angel messenger and our day come down and roll that stone away roll that stone away break that seal of man break all of the traditions and ideas that we have and give us the ability to see inside the proof isn't it wonderful to think that we've been given that proof and not just that that proof is that he rose from the grave oh my that that up from the grave he arose a mighty triumph over his foes to think that every single one who was against him had to now see the proof they had to see that what he said was true that all the promises in the Bible was now culminating in the life that quickening power of Romans chapter 8 verse 11 but it was only an angel that could reveal what was inside they had set a guard they had set a seal they made sure that Sepulcher was sure right pilate told him make it as sure as he can because those unbelievers believed they knew something was going to happen so they had to go and do that and isn't it interesting brothers and sisters that what happened was when he did come forth out of the grave and those soldiers went back they didn't go back to pilate they knew better than that they went back to the high priest trembling and the trembling soldiers told the high priest what happened an angel was there and he's gone and they said oh no it can't be we we knew that was going to happen and the Bible says they gave them big money to shut their mouths and the Bible says that that story still stands today they still believe the same story that that go and take this money and just go and tell everyone who asks that his disciples came and and and and broke the seal and pushed back the stone and and took his body and said that he resurrected can you imagine that it's like stealing it's so much easier just to get a job if you just get a job and get a paycheck you could live comfortably without fear but here they are spinning a Web of Lies continually trying to cover up what truly happened but I believe in their heart of hearts they knew what was going to happen they knew full well that he was coming forward from that grave but it took an angel to reveal it yeah brother Bradham he says this there's two classes of people he says I've always said excuse me I met two classes of people the fundamentals and the Pentecostals the fundamentals positionally studies the scriptures and figure it out they say well we are sons of God they believe that yes sir that they don't have any faith with it the Pentecostals has a lot of faith and they don't know their sons of God I apologize I think I said the faith on the Pentecostal side I uh I got that wrong Pentecostals has a lot of faith they don't know they're sons of God like a man got money in the bank can't write a check and the other one can the other one can write a check but got no money in the bank if you could ever just get the the thing together he says till men and women could realize you that's been truly baptized into the Holy Spirit and you have the token to display you have a right to every Redemptive blessings that God's promised everything that he promised is yours I love how he says this too brothers and sisters that's why we have to have the Holy Ghost that's what the token is that's what he's talking about here everything he promised is yours hold your token over your unwavering Faith as you pray and over his word faith in his word so brothers and sisters when we go to prayer for something when we are praying for something that we need for someone that we love for a situation that's occurred when we're praying for that every single promise is actually ours but hold that Faith over it don't say that I've got faith and I'm just going to take it and hold it I've got a token I'm just going to hold it say Lord Jesus come and pray for me come and intercede for me you're the Holy Spirit I love how brother Emmanuel said that he said you know if we go looking for Jesus we need to look for Jesus on the inside we need to see his deeds in our lives but when we have his deeds living out through us then we can bear witness of that life of that quickening power but unless we're willing to go through and weed the garden and take a look inside our life we might not be able to see him but boy once we see him once we're able to show him to the world around us people take notice whether about him in the rising of the Sun it brought your body not well you say well not let me tell you something my pastor I don't care what your pastor says he says it pretty straight it's what the word says and I would say it this way too don't care what I say if I'm your pastor don't care what I say if I'm off the word care what the word says only what the word says if a pastor anywhere if a minister anywhere if anybody anywhere ever says anything that's off of the word take the word don't take their word if you want to be a chicken go on with him but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the Eagles he's a feeder of the Hennessy not of the Eagles eats On Eagle's food see I believe we've just had an abundance of Eagle food this week the Lord's been so good to us he said Eagle eats On Eagle's food see they're clean the Bible said it's wrong to do that and the men and so forth and that's what all you do that's wrong say the days of Miracles has passed this Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever if they say that's a mental telepathy and it's some kind of a mind reading this discernment and all these visions and things is nonsense see they are chickens and I can't help but what brother Branham talking like this to think that they're not just chickens in terms of you know clucking hens on the ground and scratching through the manure and and looking for the seeds and maybe the food scraps that get thrown out to them they're not just chickens that way but they're afraid you ever deal with a chicken man you can have a chicken that you raise from an egg a chick we have one called pip we raised them from an egg from an incubator he didn't have a mama didn't have a papa just had an incubator and we were his mama and his papa he comes into the world and here we have this chicken and we feed them and we look after him we water him we do all the things for him we feed them water them and make sure that he's looked after and you still you go close to him and he freaks out and runs away like you're gonna harm him and as a human being you kind of take it personal thinking my goodness don't you understand I want to actually help you but he's a chicken and he can only ever behave like a chicken and I can't help but think brother Branham he's talking about them being afraid of This Promise in the word of God people are afraid to see this Dynamic power in their lives because you're not going to act normal you're not going to be quiet you're not going to be calm brother Bradham says you're not going to sit like a dried up old stick in a service you're going to worship God because you know that you're redeemed he's the same yesterday today and forever if they say that's all a mental telepathy and some kind of mind reading this discernment and all these visions and things is nonsense see they're chickens they don't know what Eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something inside of you you're an eagle to begin with not everyone can hear the word for their day not everyone believed that it would rain in Noah's day the prophet in our day said they had Rockets scientific achievement to send Rockets into the atmosphere to prove that Noah was wrong and there's people that would say you know what the doctor's report says that this disease is actually going to overwhelm me and there's nothing that anybody can ever do about it now whose report are we going to believe are we going to believe the word of God are we going to believe the doctor's report because whose report we believe is what will happen I just can't help but think that he's identified by his deeds and our lives and the life that we live we're going to express his life we're going to express the life that's inside of us brothers and sisters we can't hide it if we've got the Holy Ghost in our life we're going to express the Holy Ghost in our life brother Bradham said it if you've got the spirit of Dillinger inside of you you're going to be like Dillinger was if you've got the spirit of Beethoven inside of you you're going to compose and play like Beethoven did but if you've got the spirit of Jesus Christ in you then you've seen his works in the Bible as we heard last night he's identified by his deeds well there's a Bible question there has to be a Bible answer [Laughter] I just thought it was so beautiful how brother Emanuel brought the the days three days and three nights how that could be just beautiful and you know that life in the Tomb is not where where life ends it's where it begins that's the beginning of life it's the dying out as brother Mervin brought and that that chart that shows the cycle of the seed you know what the seed is not the final part the dying out of that seed is the final part but what that is is the beginning and it's the same thing as the first day of the week as we read in here when they ran to the Sepulcher to see did it happen did he come to life did he come back as he said he would there was something inside of a few of them that really wanted to believe but who says those things and let alone says them but who does them who who goes and gets killed and then comes back to life I don't think I've ever thought about the Easter Story the way that I have this year just to think about how that must have disrupted all of the disciples lives everything that they thought they knew and and believed all that that they understood about this man Jesus what it must have been like for Mary to see her son the one that she was promised by the angel to see him destroyed by Man by the most religious people and Peter the most fervent of the day but told you know what before the crows you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna oh my three times you are going to disown me you are going to not be associated with me three times Peter and what it must have been like when they had that conversation at one point we were talking about that last night after service it's tremendous it was Peter that was speaking no no no Lord I'm not going to let them come after you I'm not going to let them have a piece of you and what does Jesus do he turns to him and he says get thee behind me Satan you're an offense you you know that the word has to come to pass he could identify who was speaking in that man but what must it have been like they must have said oh that's the one who's going to betray him right but then we heard brother Emmanuel he brought it last night that's why we're having this conversation because he said go tell my disciples and Peter that I've risen go tell him he's never ever going to be not one of the twelve I just think it's so beautiful what a tremendous thing you know in in in John 14 Jesus says to them he says let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know and I just can't help but think that's the promise waiting for us brothers and sisters the day in which we live in in his house are many mansions brother Branham he says very clearly in the message of the hour 1965 that means many kinds of mansions because we're all different people some people like the ocean he said some people like the desert some people like the Foothills some people like like wherever different places different desires different people a variety of likes in in the body of Christ and and he's gone away to create a place for us to go to that we will not just maybe appreciate a little bit we'll be thrilled with and I just can't help but think of the story brother Branham talks about where he actually goes into that vision goes into that dream this is when he's telling his life story he talks about seeing that broken down wagon with a broken wheel and he says that that represents his family and then he sees that little girl and and he's like wow she's a fine young woman and and he she says hi Daddy and he's like Daddy who are you and she says don't you don't you recognize me Daddy I'm that one that you saw go cross-eyed with flies in my eyes because of the disease when when God brought that sheet down over top of your prayers and said that you're not going to be healed and that greatest battle that you ever fought where the devil came around and said you could heal everyone around look at the great healing campaigns you've done you got out and made a fool of yourself till one in the morning on the street corners preaching this gospel up and down in the Earth all around the world and he won't heal your wife or your daughter the greatest battle that he ever fought when he said though he slay me and I'll served him you can't touch me Satan the desire in his heart was to serve him he he was identified by his deeds even in his greatest trial but he sees this girl and she says hi Daddy he says if you're my daughter if you're Rebecca then where's Mama where's Mama and she says she's up in the house he says the house she says yeah Daddy we got a house right up there and he goes running up the stairs and he goes into the house it's a real place brothers and sisters he goes into the house and what does he see the chair that they took from his house because they couldn't afford the payments while he was laying his life down for the kingdom of God putting his money into the Tabernacle that people now go to but but here he sees that chair that they had and remember the story of how they came and took the chair and his wife knew they were coming they couldn't afford the payments and she did what a wife would do to try and distract him bake him a pie try and distract him maybe we should go fishing tonight honey knowing that they're coming to get the chair he tells the story it's heart-wrenching to think about but here he is and she says don't worry about us we're fine we're in that mansion that he talked about in John that place that's promised that he's gone away to make for us brothers and sisters we have a place waiting for us too in John 16 verse 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you brothers and sisters that's where we are today he has sent that comforter hasn't he don't we have that Comfort to know that we have the ability to receive the word in our day it's not a mighty sign or a Wonder because we believe the message of the hour We're Not Looking for great prayer lines and and we'll have we'll have special services like we did but we'll just get fed Eagle food and we'll just Worship the Lord we're not looking for great signs and wonders to come out of it we don't know what will happen I just can't help but to read a few more things if you're okay for a few minutes here you know First Corinthians 15 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit this is where it gets good for us brothers and sisters how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual it was the man that went into the grave but it was the spirit that quickening Spirit of Romans 8 11 that brought that man out of the grave the first man is the Earth is of the earth earthy the second man is of the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly you know out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh where where our heart is that's where our treasure is where where we dwell brothers and sisters that's really Who We Are and if we're feeding on this word if we're dwelling on this word if we're recognizing our position in Christ Jesus then brothers and sisters nothing can stop us nothing can stop us the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that Revelation that we've been given out of the rising of the sun brother Bradham says this then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of God to obedience to the word of God this is where he says it brothers and sisters it's so Crystal Clear here this then this Earthly body this body here is quickened by Romans 8 11 by that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead it gets inside of us and it quickens us but it doesn't Quicken us to a resurrection and Rapture although it will one day doesn't Quicken us to come out of the Grave before it's time we could all wind up in the grave who knows what tomorrow holds in store we don't know but once we're there there's something that's going to change our bodies it's that quickening spirit I can't help but throw this in there brother Bradham says it very clearly in the Easter seal the quickening power never loses its power it never ever loses its power and so much so that they threw a dead man in on the bones of a prophet one time didn't they they saw the enemy coming and they threw him in there on the bones and what happened that quickening power overtook him it pulled his his soul right back from wherever he was in the regions Beyond brother Branham says this then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to spirit of God sorry to obedience to the word of God quickly when he wanted to know how he could get there with her talking about the eagle he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't jump you can't you can't flap your wings you can't get excited and go a little higher brothers and sisters I would that everyone would get a little bit excited and go a little bit higher don't don't stay stay on the ground flap your wings and allow that that quickening power to take over and just see what happens he says when he wanted to know he could get there with her he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't jump no higher than you can jump you can't get no higher than you can jump sorry see he's a chicken see but this ego said that's not so well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are you're an eagle just start spreading those wings and get a little exercise in them brothers and sisters I can't help but think the the chickens are the spectators the Eagles are the players the players are going to be the ones that jump the players are going to be the ones that live by faith the players are going to be the ones that say Hey I think God wants me to move somewhere he wants me to do something different with my life is there a church there because if there's not a church there I don't know if I want to go there it's going to be something inside of them that wants to follow the word of God we become quickened to the word of God not quick into an idea well look at those chickens no matter what the chickens are your ego just starts spreading those wings and get a little exercise in them start moving up to the word to the word here he says it again to the word to the word brothers and sisters I want to say it if we if we have an idea that we just can't raise our hands and just sing to God and maybe Sway and dance and and Shout just just try it one time brother Bradham is saying it just try it one time raise your hands to God and see if he doesn't pour out a blessing on you that you can't even contain don't say it's my Canadian tradition it's my whatever tradition if that's the way it is brothers and sisters allow his Spirit to come into you and see if you won't see a difference he says no matter what the chickens are you're an eagle just start spreading those wings and get a little exercise in them there's been times in my life where I raise my hands and I get sore shoulders and you know what I want to do I want to press into it and say oh I don't want to lift weights I want to praise God you know brother Branham said it a man isn't known by the muscles in his arms or his body a man is known by the bags in his knees from the prayer life that he has with God it's not the way we suppose start moving up the word to the word when that word comes to the word inside of us something happens to us we flap our wings and we go a little higher and what he's talking about is higher in Revelation higher in Christ higher in understanding the things of the message of the hour The Works that I do shall you also he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he also see because I live he lives also and if the spirit that raised up him from the dead dwells in you it quickens your mortal body but it doesn't Quicken us the way we maybe we think it's going to Quicken us to come out of the Grave Just Like Jesus did one day it might one day it will if we don't actually go into Sky we're going to be in the grave we know we have this this Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine brother Branham talks about that talking to the life insurance salesman we have that assurance that if we get into the graveyard it's going to get us out of their life insurance won't get us out of the graveyard but his quickening spirit will get us out of the graveyard we have that Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine I just can't help but think brothers and sisters believe us thou this my goodness what a tremendous time I'm just going to read this scripture I'll call the uh the musicians I just want to say this as we close the meetings for this week talking about the original messenger to the Gentile Church brothers and sisters Paul speaking to the church we follow the teachings of Paul some folks might say that we just follow the teachings of William Branham but if you take a look at what William brownham preached he preached what Paul preached and when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw that vision of all those people over there he told that angel do I have to be judged with my people the angel said yep that voice yep you do and he said oh my well if Paul's people have to be judged then I I preached what Paul preached and that's what we believe we believe what Paul preached but in what he said to the Philippians maybe stand with me as we close this morning Philippians 3 verse 7. but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ as a believer of this word there comes a point where we have to say I'm going to get into shaky Waters I might get into a place that's beyond where I've always been I'm going to step into a place that that's going to require more faith brother Branham says we need more faith now than any other age we're going where no one has ever gone before we're going to see things that no one has ever seen before because nobody in in the Gentile church has ever been where we are today but you know I believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters just because nobody's gone there doesn't mean we need to be chickens we don't need to be afraid we can have full confidence because we know just like Joshua was commissioned we've been commissioned as well we've been commissioned to go all the way to cross right over Jordan and we know that means to go on to the New Birth means to go into our Promised Land which is Christ but here we have Paul saying to the Philippians but what things I uh things were gained to me those I counted for loss accounted loss for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord I just can't help but think that's exactly what brother Bradham was saying the word to the word the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith we know there's coming a time in the life of every single believer where it's no longer our faith where it becomes his faith living out through us and that's what that quickening Spirit does brothers and sisters it gives us a faith that's Supernatural to believe in these things that we're talking about to just understand that we can understand with our natural thinking we just have to have faith but it's his faith living out through US verse 10 says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death I just think that's so powerful the power of his resurrection that's what we all desire but if any means if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect none of us are perfect brothers and sisters except for that word that's inside of us when we say Amen to that word then we become perfected I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am all I am apprehended which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count myself to have account not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters verse 14. I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus to consider the words that were spoken this week and just to recognize there's nothing that we could ever do except for say Amen to the word except for be able to believe the word but you know the ability to believe to truly believe this word is that greatest miracle that in itself is the greatest miracle if we truly believe it seeing a healing saying someone raised from the dead getting a big fat bank account or a big house all new clothes all of that is nothing it's all going to burn the only thing that we have is the ability to believe this word for our day and that's the holy ghost that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever that's the quickening spirit if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead that rolled away that stone dwells in you then it will Quicken your mortal body the word to the word I just want to suggest that maybe check that out look it up the word to the word it's a strange saying isn't it but maybe the Lord will just Quicken it to our spirit if we just study it a little bit God bless you today let's bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you today we thank you for your Resurrection we thank you Lord Jesus that you were willing to come and die and take our place Lord that you became sin for our sake Lord oh Father we know that was the greatest oh it totally duped the devil he could not believe that you would condescend that far Lord Jesus it just makes me wonder how magnificent you really are and with our minds our finite Minds we have no way of really understanding that but Lord there's something in the heart of every single human being that desires to worship something and father you have made it so Crystal Clear to us as Believers we know who we believe We Know Who You Are and we thank you for the ability to recognize you in our day Lord Jesus I pray that you would just take the words that were spoken Lord this morning and this week father and that you would Quicken them to our spirit Lord that you would Quicken them to our bodies Lord to our minds and to our souls father that we would feed upon this word maybe just a little bit more than we have in the past father that maybe we would want to try just a little bit harder Lord Jesus maybe that we would just want to try and flap our wings as Eagles just a little more father or jump a little higher Lord Jesus just to see you we know the children of Israel they were in in bondage for 30 years longer than the promised Lord father I pray that your children would begin to cry out unto you father in this age that Lord perhaps we wouldn't go over time in this age Lord we know that you've already sent a deliverer but father even so come Lord Jesus we just asked that you would go with us as we go our separate ways father that you would be with those who were traveling that you would bring them back home safely at the appointed time father that you would just Lord if it's your will for us to gather together again on Wednesday Lord that we would be just careful to come and and consecrate ourselves unto you once again Lord we love you and we thank you and we just give you all the praise and all the glory of Our Lives Lord go with us now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen if that same spirit that raised him from the dead if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you if the safe spirit that raised Christ from the dead [Music] Quicken your mortal body that Spirit dwells in you [Music] you're partial body

can surrender all to him we don't have to stay down we can just get back up again and surrender it all unto him if we fall down tomorrow brothers and sisters just live in his presence and surrender all to him and he will come on the scene and lift you up my goodness All to Jesus [Music] I Surrender [Music] Ed worldly pleasures [Music] I Surrender [Music] foreign [Music] let me know [Applause]
