Description:
When with the Saviour 
We enter the gloryland
Won't it be wonderful there
Ended the troubles and
Cares of the storyland
Won't it be wonderful there

CHORUS
Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing 
With heart-bells all ringing
Oh won't it be wonderful there

Walking and talking with Christ
The supernal One
Won't it be wonderful there
Praising adoring the
Matchless eternal One
Won't it be wonderful there

There where the tempest 
Will never be sweeping us
Won't it be wonderful there
Sure that forever the 
Lord will be keeping us
Won't it be wonderful there
