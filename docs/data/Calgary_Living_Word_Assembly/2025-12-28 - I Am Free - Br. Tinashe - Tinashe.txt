========================================

When I think of Jesus, This man who died for me took my sins away. What made him give his life? What was the meaning of amazing grace? I just couldn't see this bloody lamb that was slain for me. I could not believe. I could not believe the suffering he bore. Took my place on that tree. Despised and rejected. At least the father to give a son for my life smitten and a flame dead. I am now a prayer sinner of Christ. I could not believe. I could not believe to save me from the rock. He covered me with his blood. Amazing grace I see. Amazing grace I see. Justified I stand free from the bondages of sin. Christ now dwells within. I'm free. He was the perfect sacrifice. The lamb gave me his life. despised and rejected. It pleased the father to give a son for my life. Smitten and afflicted. I am now a prayer sinner of Christ. I've never known such love. I've never known such love to save me from the wrong. He covered me with his blood. Amazing grace I see. Amazing grace I see. Justified, set free from the bondages of sin. Christ now dwells within. I'm free. He was the perfect sacrifice. The lamb gave me his life. The cross. The cross. The cross. The cross. Now I'm living my life in the bloody footprints of the cross. The cross. The cross. The cross. The cross. Now I'm living my life in the bloody footprints of the cross. Now I'm living my life in the bloody footprints of the cross. Lord, please keep me in the bloody footprints of the cross.
