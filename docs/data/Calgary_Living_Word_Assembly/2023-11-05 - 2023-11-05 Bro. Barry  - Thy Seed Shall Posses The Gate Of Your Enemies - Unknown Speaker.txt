pr you see great the da follow da by day day by day day for this we I pray to see your c d for the be D day by day amen bless you all this is not easy for me to stand here today the Lord's put a few things on my heart that to share with you just going to start with reading a scripture it's John 14 verse 20 at that day you shall know I am in my father and ye in me and I in you thank you thank it's a very powerful statement yes and when you've received the true revelation of that the knowing the Blessed Assurance it's perfect faith brother brandham preached acting recognizing or receiving and then acting that's in the acting of it I'm acting here today the Bible talks about all the great Saints by Faith by Faith by faith that is because they acted upon that knowing their position in Christ amen I wrote this poem about two months ago and in the last month been going through a trial but now I see it was would fully helped me understand we have to stop relying on our flesh to try and solve our problems and rely on that knowing that control tower when you receive that knowing all Hell Comes against you every little position and place he can maybe you might think it's through your wife or your kids actually through this flesh 99.99% of all my problems is this flesh yes the other 0 one% it's only because I allow him to have that through someone else but it's always this anyway the Lord wants us to understand who we are and this poem is called the full adoption process and it's a process yes so many times we forget that that it's a process in the depths of my soul I cried out to God seeking relief from my flaws a Divine nod but his response was unexpected a gentle refrain for he whispered to my heart it's for you to abstain I yearn for patience in a world of haste surprisingly God's response silence my desperate Chase patience cannot be granted my dear child it's obtained through your tribulations where you're beguiled I plead it for an end to my sorrows and pain hoping God would spare me my Strife that drains he answered softly suffering always draws you near to me your anchor removing all worldly fear in seeking spiritual growth my spirit to ignite I implored God to elevate me to Greater Heights Lord excuse me thankfully he replied with wisdom you must learn to submit to grow by my pruning and refining you'll surely flourish and glow with a heavy heart I ask God to make me whole to fill the empty spaces and mend my unfulfilled Soul again he acknowledged Me Gently please remember this your spirit is already complete your body a temporary vessel constantly in Retreat longing for Earthly Pleasures I made my plea to indulge in all things that would make me feel free God responded like only a father could I've given you my eternal breath in that realization find joy in all moments tell death as I thought sought true happiness a lasting sensation God's report brought Clarity erasing my frustrations happiness resides within it's an Outlook of Grace Choose Love count your blessings in all things wear Joy on your face it's a tough one sometimes amen but it's a true son and daughter stance yes it's what he wants us to learn and know recently I asked God to help me to love like him to love even my enemies to DARE tear down hatred Grim he smiled with immense Delight saying my child you finally see with such Clarity love is your true purpose the reason you came to be to Simply display my total victory in that moment of truth my heart did race understanding The Power of Love bolstered with Grace in surrendering to his plan my soul secure I am led by God's perfect love and in his presence I am me and you we stand pure sub pure the bride is to manifest his love of applied in Grace a perfect body United by his great faith the culmination of all things an end to the race displaying his perfect attribute before leaving time space Lord bless you [Applause] all God bless you church and thanks for that poem Brother Don I think uh now I know why

bless you musicians thank you each one if you have your Bibles this morning we just like to read from Genesis chapter 22 just like to welcome all of our visitors certainly always a pleasure to see you brother Larry sister Karen every time I see brother Larry I just think about good times I think about fishing certainly an honor and a privilege to have the Halverson with us today we have the carpenters here as well God bless you brother Jerry and Sister Mary and each one I trust you feel right at home today Genesis chap 22 verse 10 and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son amen could you imagine that and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God Amen seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah V Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen amen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply ly thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord to read this scripture to look back through the sands of time and to think about the many blessings that were given so freely yes because of The Obedience of one man thank you Lord father we pray for that kind of obedience today amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the many blessings associated with this scripture that we've read this morning Father that apply to our lives and we pray that you would just take this scripture and open it fresh to us Lord that you would just feed us of yourself that bread of life once again that comes down from heaven father Lord we love you and we thank you and we just commit all things that are said and done this morning into your hands Amen in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated it's just wonderful to be in his presence does something you know brother bradam says if you've got a religion that's dead you better go bury it and get one that's alive you know in our scripture this morning I just uh I want to talk about thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies once again I want to continue on with what we were talking about last Sunday and I think it's just so beautiful how there is a seed that will possess the Gate of his enemy we know this is an Old Testament Prophecy from nearly the beginning of the entire Bible but we know that it's just as effective as the very last part of the Bible in Revelation we know that all of it applies to our lives even today yes before before we get too far I just want to announce that we've got the ladies brunch coming up this Saturday the 11th from 10:30 to 1:30 at our house um I'm sure all the details are worked out with the sisters um we have a communion service Sunday uh the next day next weekend it's going to be at 6:00 pm and we have a youth meeting Sunday the 19th I believe it's from 1: till 5:00 pm at the clant and we have the uh the very special privilege of having brother Jerry Fox coming to present uh his testimony and some encouragement to the youth Hallelujah and I believe that the uh parents of the children uh whoever would be interested are invited to come as well which I think is such an important thing for the parents to be involved uh you know that every single parent here has a testimony and uh has the ability to encourage but also to be encouraged and it's just so important for the parents to see what's actually happening in the lives of the youth when they get together so God bless you brother Joel and Sister Crystal for putting that together and uh we certainly are excited to see what the Lord will do I have uh couple of places that I'm going to read from the message today and uh as mentioned I I just got so inspired talking about the the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against that revelation we talked about um just talking about the gates of hell and we know that there's a there's a seed we read it in the scripture this morning out of Genesis CH 22 that there is a seed that shall possess the Gate of his enemy the enemy isn't going to come and possess our gates not the seed of the True Believer and we're not just talking about any seed we're talking about the Royal Seed of Abraham it it's a spiritual seed and we'll get into that but you know out of the message possessing the enemy's gates in 1959 it's it's uh 59 1108 brother bradam he says he shall possess the seed of his enemy and I think it's just beautiful I'm going to pause there for a second while they bring it up because they he shall possess the seed of his enemy and and that to me is uh is that a mistake maybe some people would say well it's a mistake because he didn't say he shall possess his seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy he says he shall possess the seed of his enemy and I personally believe that that's saying that he's going to Prevail he's going to overcome and and you know we can look at it naturally we know the natural types the spiritual and the Old Testament is the shadow of the New Testament and both of those are the shadow of our spiritual walk as Believers we we can see that there's shadows and types all through the Bible but you know when we talk about possessing the gat GES of the enemy today we're not talking about possessing the gates of Gaza we're not talking about possessing the gates of Israel we're not talking about possessing the gates of Calgary or Alberta or BC or Saskatchewan we're talking about possessing the gates of the Devils that want to come against our marriage they want to come against our children that want to come against our brothers and our sisters about their own Revelation about what it means to be a part of the body of Christ we want to come against those Gates those gates are the ones that are after us and those gates are de the Devils want to destroy us and we talked about this last week how those gates are flapping and slamming and making lots of noise in this world and we can't look anywhere in this world without seeing a Gate of Hell right because that's what's happening here this is a spiritual battle Satan is going to take as many people to hell with him as he can we know that Satan that that that hell was created for the devil and his angels but we know the mouth of Hell had to be enlarged for all those people that choose to reject the word for their their day but he shall possess the seed of his enemy we got it there beautiful thank you brother Logan he shall posed he shall possess the seed of his enemy he shall possess he'll he'll have it he'll control it it will become his property it won't be something that owns him but he rather will own it he shall possess his seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy and and I love how brother brandham goes into this now and and I just want to do this other background here I think it's really important brothers and sisters for us to recognize that as we as parents we have the ability to affect a many generation down the road from our lives we can look at our life and say well I can have pitfalls and stumbles and and I can have hard times in my life in my day but our actions today are very much affecting the actions the livelihood the abilities of the seed that's coming after us many generations after us not just the here and now but but our sons and our daughters and and their children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren he says he shall possess his seed shall possess the Gate of his Enemy No matter what the gate is if it's sickness he's going to possess that gate if it's Temptations that seed is going to possess that gate if it's sin that seed is going to possess that gate he says whatever gate it is it's conquered amen there's not something that we have to conquer we just have to accept that he's conquered it already amen says it's conquered and the Seed of Abraham possesses it so I just got thinking about this Abraham seed and it's just beautiful the story's beautiful and I know we can go a long long ways with it we've got a limited amount of time actually no we don't I think we still have another additional hour amen praise the Lord bring it on it's beautiful bring it on it's a miracle Abraham SE there's a natural lineage and we know there's a spiritual lineage I'm going to go on in this message here and uh I'm just going to say this one one part here that brother Bram he says but the promise of God is good at every gate so brothers and sisters when we come to Gates in our lives when we come to problems in our lives when we're alone and we find that Temptation becomes overwhelming what we're doing is walking along our journey and we're coming to a gate and when we get to that gate what we need to do is pull out the token the token is like the key fob that we see to today the key fob to the gate that token is going to open that gate and what's going to happen when that gate opens it's going to show that we possess that gate because the one who has the controller for that gate possesses that gate and we have the controller for every single devil that wants to try and come against us every single time we come against the devil we have the ability to possess that devil not that we want to take that devil and actually do anything with it other than rebuke it but it means control to possess we have the ability to control that devil now now we're not looking to control Devils we don't want to have pet Devils I'm not saying that what I'm saying is we're going to have them get in our way and they're going to start to boast just like David encountered that giant the Giants are going to boast in in our land and we know there's three Giants there's the lust of the flesh there's the lust of the eyes and there's the worst one of all brothers and sisters pride of life the one that's got the pride of life he'll say oh I don't suffer from either one of those two but he's the one that suffers the worst because he thinks he's okay yes but you know we've got a scripture we'll get into that a little bit later but we're looking at possessing the enemy's Gates the brandom says but the promise of God is good at every gate no matter what gate it is God's promise is good he shall possess the gates of his enemy that settles it love that when he come down to the Jordan morning talking about Joshua and how they went across into the promised land they were raised up in bondage all they knew was bondage these people they weren't born in Freedom they were born in bondage 430 years in bondage so they didn't know anything but a slave master's Whip and brother bradam talks about we know the story so well that the Egyptians could just do whatever they wanted to do with anyone at any time and there was nothing the children of Israel could do they were in full-on bondage and we know it's a type of us today mentally speaking outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost which brother Bram calls the new birth outside of that happening in our lives we are very much under the bondage of the task Master's whip in our lives mentally speaking we will never overcome but boy oh boy if we could ever surrender to that place where we recognize what he's done for us when we realize the baptism of the holy spirit for ourselves in our lives which is the New Birth when that happens something happens we begin to possess the gates of our enemies but brother Bram in this message he's talking about Joshua now going down to the Jordan River knowing that God came to him and told him be really strong and courageous and don't worry because just like I was with Moses I'm going to be with you and I'm going to mag magnify myself in you today before all the people I want them to see that I am calling you and so what did he do he called them down to cross the Jordan River when it was the most flooded but here we have the children of Israel now called out of bondage and now we've got Moses is dead the guy that called us out is dead now we're out here as good as dead and now this next guy he's raised up and says that he's got a revelation from God and now he wants to take us into a flood are you serious imagine how people started to reason looking at the natural circumstances brother Bram he says now when he come down to that Jordan that morning perhaps I'm going to believe that the devil had storm clouds hanging everywhere natural circumstances oh my we can see the natural all around us and if we're not careful we'll actually let the natural consume us the natural will start to drive our spiritual walk if we're not careful amen I'm going to believe the devil had storm clouds hanging everywhere the big old muddy waters I roll falling down the fields were swept across by a flood oh what a tempting time but Joshua said get ready you're going to see the glory of God and they Sanctified themselves and got ready making everything when everything seemed to be contrary but that was the seat of Abraham those ones that just had an ability not of their own to call the things that were as though they weren't and to call the things that weren't as though they were they recognize that there's a promised land for us there's an ability to go forwards because God's called us and and we can't explain it how can you explain it when God's called you you can't the only thing you can do is March forward by faith but that was the Seed of Abraham who God swore I'll give him the gate when he come to the Jordan that was his gate and he possessed it now imagine if we just take that story a little bit further when they did go across and they went across on dry land and there was 12 Stones that were picked up one for every tribe and and they created that that altar there they they showed that God did something for them so that their children and their children's children could go back to that place and say remember that time that we were called to go across into the promised land we we were given the ability to get the Holy Ghost now we can go back to that place and look at that pile of rocks now I say it this way those rocks of Revelation that there is a holy ghost for us to have sometimes in our lives we've got to do that we've got to pile up those those those rocks of Revelation that God gives us so that we've got a place to go back to to say I remember that time God spoke to me brother bradam says it clearly that God might only speak to us one time in our lives amen and that's all and are we willing to act on that one time that he spoke to us but you know I believe it myself as the royal Seed of Abraham not that I'm making myself anything I just can't help but think that every single one of us would be the same description that we're all the Royal Seed of Abraham and that every time God speaks to us we want to hear his voice more amen so we walk towards him and we know that he says if you draw nigh unto me I will draw nigh unto you he doesn't just keep stepping backwards every time we step forwards he steps forward also he wants to have that relationship with us but there is a people that Sanctified themselves here and and they made ready they made everything ready when it seemed to be contrary and brother bam says they went and and they possessed the gate they went across the river but now they come to a place that's just a fortifi fortified Fortress brother bradam said the walls around Jericho was the very next place we know that Joshua was out and he was probably just having a little bit of meditation time he was away from everyone and suddenly he sees a man standing there and what did he do he he did exactly what he was instructed to to do right he was strong and courageous and he ran towards the man and he said to him are you for us or are you against us and we know that he said nay but I'm I'm captain of the Lord's host oh my and the ground that you're standing on buddy is Holy Ground so just take off those shoes and demonstrate to me just like Moses did that you understand who you're talking to and we know that he did that and he was given the instructions through that meeting to go and take Jericho Jericho being heavily fortified another gate a giant gate big iron gates on it you can imagine wooden iron gates while so big they raised chariots on top brother bram's said can you imagine that but they were given the key to it they were given the key fob to that gate weren't they and all they had to do was March forwards and follow the instructions and it's interesting because the instructions were shut your mouths and March around don't say a word until I tell you to say a word just March around and blow the horns once March around blow the horns once just keep doing that until the time is right and on the seventh day March around and then lift up your voice because your salvation is here you know what they weren't told to be quiet to see the victory in that instance right to take that gate they were told to Rejoice to shout with a loud voice make a loud noise I can't help but think brothers and sisters how much more Sons and Daughters of the most high God who have been given the ability to recognize all these Mysteries have just been given to us freely in the book and alls we've got to do is just say Amen to the word how much more should we raise our voice to the Lord hallelujah I just can't help but think because they followed it they followed the instruction the letter of the instruction they followed it they had the possession of that gate they took Jericho and they did nothing for it the only thing they did was follow the instruction because they followed that instruction all those walls just fell down and they marched right in and they completely took over and spoiled that City and you know what it's the same way for the devils in our lives brothers and sisters there's no devil that can actually hold have a stronghold in our lives We are tearing down strongholds that's what we're doing in our day and I think it's beautiful because we have so much Revelation it's like brother Larry said this morning oh in his prayer to know really where we are look at the rest of the world it's Fallen apart we were talking about having maybe a bit of a renovation here in this building and to have an elevator to take us up and wouldn't it be nice but what about a a light speed elevator brothers and sisters that's just going to take us to another dimension and that's going to happen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we've never been closer to it amen so I want to say this today if we have the ability to hear the word for our day brothers and sisters don't give up don't don't get tired don't get weary now this is is the time to get excited because instead of actually going down we're going up and and it's a blending of the dimensions it's not something that's just suddenly an event is going to cataclysmically happen in the airplanes and Trains and Automobiles and everything is just going to fall apart like that we know the world is falling apart but what we're doing is we're blending the dimensions we're hearing from our theophanies we're getting the ability to say Amen because we know that we have another representation we look at this flesh and we say this seed this seed is a natural seed oh my this seed has nothing this seed has no there's no way this seed could inherit incorruption and that's what the word of God says incorruption corruption cannot inherit incorruption we know that's the case we're talking today about the the seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies amen if we can follow the word of God for our day then then the seed will possess the Gate of his enemies brother bradam in the exposition of the seven Church ages the saman church age says did not Jesus say in John 6:49 your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished yet they were in the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually isn't it wonderful to think that we can we can read this and understand that we have in our day a a prophet that would give prophetic insight and and preach a message called the seed shall not be air with the shu but remember in that message he also says without the Shu there can't be a seed I don't think he says it exactly like that but that's one thing that I took away from it so don't get me wrong I'm not trying to misquote the prophet because he might not say that exactly word for word but what I am saying brothers and sisters is without a shock there's no seed but the seed will create a shock because that's part of the genetic code in the seed it has to have something that will actually protect it and we know by election there's people in this world that just don't have the ability or never did have the ability to see the things that we see but blessed are your eyes brothers and sisters blessed are our eyes for they see the things of God we know that the disciples asked Jesus why do you speak in Parables all the time why do you keep doing that and he said because it's not given to everyone to understand because if it was then they would be able to see and they would be able to hear and then they would be healed but it's not according to election amen God has a an an election he has a course he has a a direction that he wants to do things and it's not for everyone that's why I think we should be the happiest people on Earth to recognize what God's done for us it's not just a matter of saying I believe the message of the hour oh my I'm saved it's great I I I associate with Calgary Living Word or I associate with another group of people those are the things that are going to put you into tribulation but when you can say I found the pearl of great price through the message of the hour the Lord Jesus Christ himself has revealed himself to me my goodness brothers and sisters then it's different then you are actually catching the awareness of what it means to see the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were spiritually am brother Bram goes on to say but to go on these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same same elect are called by another name in Romans 4:16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed understanding that it is what God did by The Obedience of One Way Way Back which is giving those children who are the promised seed further ahead the ability to inherit the blessing they never did anything for it so if we can recognize that we are royal Seed of Abraham brothers and sisters it's only by grace that we're saved through faith because we believe in this word but how do we believe it's only by God it's only by Revelation that we heard we know that Peter he said to Jesus when he asked him that question he said he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said Flesh and Blood never revealed that to you that was a revelation that was something that came from God directly to you Peter but Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell they won't Prevail against that it wasn't that the gates of hell wouldn't Prevail against Peter and that they wouldn't Prevail against him being a disciple and that they wouldn't Prevail against the church that those Gates of Hell wouldn't Prevail against the Revelation about who Jesus Christ is to the individual once that Revelation strikes the heart the gates of hell can't Prevail brothers and sisters going back to the scripture here Romans 4:16 therefore it is of faith that it might be grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed that word sure just jumped out at me and I thought why why is that sure it's be be be bias be bias and it's it's from the base of G3 J from the base of G 939 through Strong's Concordance it says through the idea of basal the foundation I'm saying stable literally or figuratively firm of force steadfast sure that word sure it's made sure why is it made sure it's made sure so that it is to all of the seed now many times people will get caught up in looking at the natural seed and say the natural seed I I'm of the natural seed of so and so we know there was a group of people that said well we're the natural lineage of Abraham yeah he was our father we know exactly who he was but who are you you claimed to be someone and you're acting all spiritual and Pious before us but who are you we know who Abraham was isn't that interesting brother brandham goes on to say here I'm getting ahead of myself he goes on to say not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham it's the same scripture he's continuing on with it who is the father of us all how can he be the father of us all when we're way down through time and and history though there's a group of people that claim he was the father of them Romans 97-113 says neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called and we know that that was the one promised son that was the one where the promise lied we know that that Abraham and Sarah they tried to make it work on their own God gave the promise but they said you know maybe it's just not working Sarah came and said you know honey maybe God's just tired and maybe it's just not going to happen the way that that you interpreted that he said it to you maybe he said it and you just thought it a different way maybe you had a dream and it was just a little bit funny and you know we could just make it happen I could see how we could connect the dots here and make this happen you'll have a son don't worry right here we have the natural solution for the spiritual problem the spiritual equation God saying that there will be a sun and it will be of your loins it won't come from the outside there won't be a natural solution to it and so many times I just can't help but think brothers and sisters in our lives we're looking for a natural solution to a spiritual problem and God will keep us wandering in the Wilderness as we do that looking for those spiritual Solutions through natural places we won't find it that way neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed now when I was studying this I just couldn't help but think about Romans chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to who to those who are not walking after the flesh but they're walking after the spirit right those who are in Christ Jesus who who walk not after the flesh but are walking in the spirit and you know there is a royal Seed of Abraham that is walking after the Lord Jesus that's not walking according to the flesh many times in our lives we can see the natural circumstances around us but are we willing to just press pause and ask the Lord to reveal to us how should we go about this how should we move forwards or are we trying to find the solution on our own are we just groping and and stumbling in darkness and finding that we're you we're up today and we're down tomorrow and we're up today and we're down tomorrow brothers and sisters that's no way for a Believer to live spiritually speaking we should have buoyancy we should have ballast in our lives we should be able to take on enough weight of the word in our lives to keep us stable when we hit those stormy waters in our boat of life but the only way we can do that is to stay in the word we talked about it I think it was on Wednesday if we start trying to feed the holy spirit in our life with the garbage of this world it ain't going to work right we're actually going to get spiritually sick and then we're going to see trials and then we're going to go in circles and we'll wander in the wilderness until we're willing to actually say okay Lord I'll take you at your word because we know that he speaks to us and we know that all we have to do is go back to where we got off so long as we're willing to do that he's right there waiting for us going on here brother bradam says for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca had also conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth am Hallelujah it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it was written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated can you imagine that I just think when I read that it makes me so humbled makes me think so so thankful so grateful so much gratitude for the Lord because I have the ability to hear this word it's not making me anything it's making me nothing it's making me realize outside of election I would be a sinner out there in the world just just lost as lost can be am but somehow he saw fit for me to be part of of another seed amen and and I believe the same thing for you brothers and sisters because you want to sit here and listen to these words talking about another seed and I think it's so beautiful because something has happened in our lives we've been given the rock of Revelation and the gates of hell can't Prevail against that and when the Devil comes around to try and tell us no I'm prevailing I'm prevailing you've got this or you're encountering that or whatever the other is we can say no I've got the token I've got the token in my life you can have this flesh take this flesh put me in the grave but you'll never kill me you'll never ever touch my soul and you could even go further with it and say you know what I'm going to actually go and be seated in that Throne right where you want to be Satan but you'll never be there because you chose to actually try and exalt yourself above that throne but now you're going to be brought down to Hell you'll be on the sides of the pit and and the people will walk by and wag their heads at you and say you're the one that troubled us all of our Lives you're the one that's scripture it's going to happen he knows it he knows it better than most theologians do Galatians 3:16 Says now to Abraham and his seed were made were the promises made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ Galatians 3:29 and if ye be then ye are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise for the longest time I wondered how how what's the connection there how could I be Abraham's seed how how is there but it's just right there brothers and sisters if you're in Christ then you are Abraham's seed because Christ is actually through the lineage of Abraham and and we know there's there's Brothers uh maybe brother mvin has that on the timeline I don't know but he is definitely in the lineage of Abraham Christ is is but here we have it in Galatians 3:29 and if you be Christ if you're Christ this morning brothers and sisters then ye are Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise and HS that means according to the promise that's been given to this age to the Overcomers of the leodan age you're not going to go and stand around the throne you're going to be seated with him in his throne you're going to have full Authority and and and I want to say this I'm jumping ahead again but I believe it right now we have full Authority how many people have ever spoken words and then seen it come to pass many people in the world might say well it's just coincidence and we've done that too and you know how can you say that it's Hocus Pocus no it ain't no we're living under an anointing under this age and I believe that a lot of the world knows there's something going on but they don't understand it that's why they come out with with shows that are called Supernatural but isn't it interesting that there was none of that before there was a Vindicated prophet in the Land There was actually demonstrating Supernatural to this world Amen there's a purpose for it there's an anointing to this age and as we've said we'll say it again there's a blending of the ages we're blending ourselves to the place where we're realizing there's no Perfection that we're going to put on there's no Perfection that we're going to learn we're not going to go to obedience school and actually get this flesh into a place of perfection this flesh cannot ever be perfect this flesh is hybrid this flesh has to perish that's why we have to become a new creature in Christ Jesus first so that we can go and step into that new body when it comes down amen but we know brothers and sisters as we read in our scripture this morning over in in in Genesis chapter 22 that Abraham had lived his life he had been a faithful servant unto God God manifest in his life in such a tremendous fashion spoke to him as a friend we know that there's many different examples but God came and spoke to him and came and spoke to him and came and spoke to him and even introduced himself in the plains of mammory we know that happened and he had the ability through Revelation to recognize that that was God Elohim there with him and we know that he had the ability to say my Lord not Lords but there was others in Sodom and Gomorrah they didn't have the ability to recognize it and they said my lords we know that there's a lot of backstory to this story where we're at right now 25 years later after believing in the promise after being faithful after staggering not at the promise of God through unbelief but being strong and having good courage that the one who promised was able to deliver amen here he gets the promise and then God says to him now I want you to take that promise take your son that promised one and and kill him for me take him up to the top of the mountain that place that I'll show you and and kill him sacrifice him and we know we've talked about this in the past but I think it's just such an important thing I I want to make sure that we remember this how important it is that Abraham was given the instruction to go and kill his son and we started with the verse 10 that said Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and we know that even his son said to him part of the conversation was his son recognized father here's the wood and and here's the flame but where's the sacrifice it doesn't add up and what did Abraham say he said my son don't worry that God God will provide himself a sacrifice it's not something that that we need to try and worry about don't trouble yourself with that son the son wouldn't have the ability to have the Revelation yet am even though the sun was reasoning according to the circumstances and imagine how heavy that must have weighed on Abraham in that moment oh my but we know the word says in that moment that he staggered not at the at the promise of God through unbelief he didn't say oh no what are we doing maybe we should just go and quickly grab something and bring it with us just in case no he followed the word of God to the letter he took his son up there and where we picked up is that he had gone 25 years now believing that God was able to give that promise that he told him about and now this promise is right here on the stone and he's just about to chop his throat comes back with a knife and he hears the angel of the Lord Abraham Abraham stop stop stop oh my now I know that you love me and we know we've talked about it it was actually Abraham learning that he loved him because God was God God knew all about it from the beginning of the world the foundation of the world he knew that Abraham was going to be that he knew that he was going to do that he knew he was going to follow him he knew all of that he's God right but Abraham needed to know that he loved God that much that he was willing to follow him to the letter of the word and because of that his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy what a tremendous blessing that is to think and then thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice isn't that wonderful to think about brothers and sisters we know what's going to happen when Grace is removed from this world we know that right now the Lord is actually pulling his anointing from the Gentile church that's lifting off of the Gentile church when you look all around and you see what's going on it's not good we can see it happening and that spirit is going to go right over to Israel while the world is surrounding Israel now they're pulling all their backing from Israel they're saying they're going too strong and and whatnot I'm not going political here but what I am saying is watch the demonstration of the Lord Jesus Christ when he gets over there and I trust we'll all be doing it from that other side from our theophany bodies we won't be here on Earth witnessing it through news feeds but we'll actually be witnessing it from heaven but I think we'll just be too busy worshiping because we'll know what the Lord has done for us we won't even be worried about the Earthly things we'll just be waiting for our our brothers to come and and just worship with us there right but you know brothers and sisters to think about this there is a spiritual blessing on the Earth today Hallelujah and this scripture here it says and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed why would it be all of the nations of the earth goodness it's because there's a spiritual seed that's going to be in every single nation all around the world it's not just talking about the Jews here it's talking about the Royal Seed of Abraham those ones who are in Christ that we've already read about because those who are in Christ they are that Royal Seed of Abraham they're the ones who are counted worthy of the promise and not because of anything they done it's just because that God said hey before the foundation of the world I've chosen to love them and I've chosen to hate the other one now how can we explain that we can't explain it we just have to say Amen thank you Lord thank you Lord for calling me by my name thank you Lord for giving me salvation but you know in our lives brothers and sisters were no different than Abraham the only way we're going to see the blessing is to First go through the trial there ain't no free lunch in this world is there amen that's that's that's one thing that's said worldly but you know there's got to be a trial in our lives there's got to be a trial to prove God will allow the trials to come our way to prove his word in our lives he will allow the trials to come our way and I said it before I'll say it this time again I think it's so good so that he can squeeze Us in the trial and show who's on the inside because whoever's inside is going to come out in that squeeze brothers and sisters don't look for a a a a spiritual squeeze on the church look for the spiritual squeeze in our lives look for the spiritual squeeze in our lives and when it happens because it's not if it will when it will we want to make sure that the right one comes out that the Lord Jesus Christ on the inside comes out and says be it unto me according to thy will Lord if you want me to go through this Valley that I know you'll take my hand and you'll lead me right through this Valley and one of these days we'll find ourselves on the mountain top but we can't stay on the mountain top because nothing grows on the Mountaintop the only life is down in the valley but Lord lead me beside Still Waters oh Father take thy rod and thy staff and comfort me take me and and and prepare me a table before my enemies Lord just have your will and your way in my life don't leave me wandering around in the wilderness and he won't we know that he won't but that's the spiritual Seed of Abraham they're going to say the word of God they're going to live by that they going to prove through the trial who they are amen and he will show who is who amen it just got me thinking about it you know what we're doing we're just living in a proving ground right now that's all this is yes it is we're living in a Proving Ground and he's just proving his word amen we had a prophet preach that message proving his word and you know what that's what he's doing in our lives every single day every single day in our lives he's proving his word and it's not something that we can do it's not something that we even really desire to do is something that he does and it constrains us as prisoners of Christ just like Paul to actually surrender Our Lives surrender our Wills surrender every part of us unto him amen and it just makes me think you know we need to stop trying ourselves and just start speaking we need to start speaking the word brothers and sisters we're not we're not living under the the natural lineage of Abraham we're not living under the the the even the first and second polls according to William Mary and bram's message but we're living under the third pole we're third pole recipients here today the Royal Seed of Abraham we got to stop trying to do things on our own and start speaking and I'm not saying go out and and climb up on a fence or a an overpass and and and put our shoulders back and chin up and speak to the wind and speak the storm to go back God's not going to clown for nobody I'm not talking about that what I'm talking about brothers and sisters is start speaking the word through the Oracles of God let him manifest his voice through our voice box surrender Our Lives to the point where he can speak through US spend the time in prayer where we see him manifest so much in our lives it's not even us speaking anymore it's just him speaking thank you Lord stop trying to make it happen trying to reason it through trying to think it through trying to feel like it should happen a certain way you know in this message possessing the enemy Gates brother bradam he says God will allow trials to come around just to prove who we are he'll actually let something come into the church because we see something happen that we think shouldn't happen the way that it's happening and and he'll allow it amen yes he says if we Elevate men in this message if we'll take a Ministry and we'll Elevate them and put them up there he said God will allow that man to fall so that you'll take your eyes off the man and you'll put them right back on God don't elevate anybody but Jesus Christ brothers and sisters make sure that he's the one that's exalted in your life make sure he's the one that your children see you talking about not talking about your brother or your sister but talking about the goodness of God in your life talking about the goodness of God and your brothers and your sisters talk about God talk about the Lord Jesus Christ speak the word and go forwards because when we do that brothers and sisters we can have automatic courage we don't have to have fear fear is bondage bondage of a spirit that's come back into our life to make us afraid to think oh my something's out of control God's not dealing with a situation the way I think you should so now I've got to do something I got to act if we're doing that the devil's got you you're stopped right there that Gates's closed and you will not take that gate but if you can say hey I've got the holy ghost in my life and I don't understand it and maybe even it frustrates me because we're looking at the human nature I know God's in control he's going to move this gate he's the one that's got to open it he's the one that's got to close it when we can do that brothers and sisters we'll see him do it and you will possess the Gate of your enemy it won't be it won't be something that fences Us in that stops us from going forwards it will just move out of the way possessing the enemy's Gates paragraph 52 thank you brother Bram says on the day of Pentecost he sent down the Holy Ghost sorry I'll go slow so so you can get there on the day of Pentecost he sent down the Holy Ghost to continue get there to continue through the Gentiles yes sir I love that just even that paragraph that sentence he sent down the Holy Ghost to continue through the Gentiles it wasn't for the Jews interesting hey he sent the Holy Ghost to continue down through the Gentiles to take out a seed of promise to give to the Gentiles the offcast to give to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring them into the promise now we have a right to conquer all sickness Hallelujah yes that's right isn't that beautiful amen you know in this message brother Bram says it doesn't matter what we've seen happen in someone's life we have a right to conquer sickness because he paid for it at Calvary he paid for it before Calvary with those 39 Stripes didn't he yes by my stripes you are healed by my stripes you were healed present present tense and past tense so here we have I would say God speaking through the prophet we have a right we have a right to conquer all sickness we don't have to conquer it and here's the key we don't have to conquer it brothers and sisters I live for a long time thinking we have to conquer it somehow I have to change my prayer life maybe I need to change my spiritual diet maybe I need to go to church more maybe we need to have more prayer meetings maybe I need to study more maybe I have to preach louder or harder or something we've got to maybe do something I'm just being honest we got to do something with the oil that we anoint people with is it special oil that we get from a special Ministry somewhere is there somehow some way something we can do but you know what we need to do is just allow him to do it we need to speak the word and trust that he's going to back it up but when we're busy trying to do it he's just going to say I can't do it because you're getting in my way amen h now we have the right to conquer all sickness we don't have to conquer it it's already conquered oh my we just have to claim it and and claim the promise and go take it it's already conquered amen so just take a look at the sickness brother we could say we've got sickness in our bodies we do we get sickness in our bodies and every one of us here I know can raise your hand and say he's healed me every one of us have been sick and we've all been healed we have the right to conquer sickness but there's also spiritual sickness brothers and sisters it creates a blindness in our eyes where we don't even see it where we talked about the three Giants earlier sometimes we have pride of life in our life and we just think that everything is perfect God has given me all my needs everything that I need is just looked after and isn't he so good he's a mighty God but you know what if we're not careful that in itself can take us astray because there's nothing that we've done it's all him amen sometimes we can have a spiritual sickness sometimes we can have a spiritual illness a and it will cause something else to happen we can have a relationship break down through it we can have a illness in our marriage we can have an illness in the relationships with our children yes we can have an illness in a relationship with our brothers or our sisters maybe we can have an illness between a a brother and a pastor or someone and a deacon or song leader and and maybe even another song leader in a church you can have all kinds of illness so don't just put it in a box and say it's just a a germ that we're talking about that gets inside a body no we're talking about all sickness brothers and sisters we have the right to conquer it all when we see Satan come in we don't have to tolerate him we just have to surrender it's already conquered he goes on to say we just have to claim it claim the promise and go take it yes it's already conquered amen he says death is conquered hell is conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered all Devils is conquered hell is conquered death is conquered the grave is conquered we stand in the gate taking it and don't have to fire a shot it's already been paid for yes we say it once in a while and I just will say it now maybe if anybody's interested I would say this is the fridge sticker right here amen when we need just a little reminder it's all conquered he's conquered all of it there's nothing that can stand in your way there's nothing that can stand in our way Satan will say oh yes there is but the word of God says no there ain't he said it through a Vindicated Prophet right here all Devils is conquered amen so what devil what gate can swing and flap and try and cause havoc in our lives what what what can really hold us back brothers and sisters there's nothing Can Am there's nothing Hallelujah you know talking about this seed I I just got thinking about it and and and just really started to meditate on this and I thought it was so beautiful and in Genesis chapter 4 if you if you turn with me over there to Genesis chapter 4 we still got a few minutes here you happy this [Music] morning talking about the seed and and how it was given to us you know first there's a natural seed that happens and and that's the way it is we we we have a birth in our in our family and and we have the natural seed but that that baby doesn't just automatically flow into the Royal Seed of Abraham that baby has got to go through a process even though it's our seed it has to mature it has to learn it has to hear about the word of God and if it is truly a seed of God it's going to have the ability to receive the word and say Amen to that word and and have a desire in it to to Fellowship around the word but if it doesn't have the desire at all then is it truly a seed I don't know I don't want to put anybody in or take anybody out but I just want to take a scriptural example here and and just talk about this for a minute there's there's always first a natural seed and we the beginning of Genesis CH 4 and Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground now I'm not going to go too far into that I just want to fast forward and jump down to the last of this chapter because we all know that story and maybe we'll talk a little bit about it but verse 25 of Genesis 4 and Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew and just to show an example here if we read the next verse verse 26 says and to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos and then began men to call upon the name of the Lord that Royal seed was identified right there brothers and sisters and how was it identified I would say by his nature we can take a look at the beginning of Genesis chter 4 and look at the first one that was born the first born should have had the birthright right but he didn't have the nature of his of the daddy that we want to see the the Royal Seed of Abraham coming from right he didn't have that that Daddy he had another Daddy and the genetic code that was in that boy that seed was actually of the evil one is what the word of God says Cain was of his father the devil amen I think it's beautiful because we know that Jesus he identified some other people when he was here on Earth as having the same nature and they were the ones that were the most polished Pious religious folks of the day my goodness but I think it's beautiful here we can see the identification of that Royal seed starting now in in full manifestation and we know that it took a couple generations for that to happen didn't it it wasn't just Adam's son that actually began to call upon the name of the Lord it was Adam's grandson that started to call upon the name of the Lord and isn't it interesting that that life had to manifest he couldn't contain it he couldn't hold it back he couldn't hide it it just had to happen he began to call upon the name of the Lord first there's a natural seat and I think it's beautiful how Genesis 4 starts with a birth and it ends in a birth isn't it and in the middle there's the murder and we can know all the stuff Insider but but to look at the the identification of of Cain Cain he was a murderer and a liar the identification of his father Yes how could he be the son of Adam amen the other had the desire of his late brother to call upon the name of the Lord No Doubt with a blood sacrifice and with that blood sacrifice he knew that God was pleased and what was that that was a revelation that was given to him he was taught he went to church he learned but something on the inside spoke to him and he's the one that went and acted he's the one that went after it he's the one that did it and you know what it's just too tight uh that's all we we can see there's one type that that glorifies God and there's another type that glorifies Satan and it's that simple it's cut and dried it's black and white and and and there's lots of gray in the middle if you want to make it that way but through revelation we don't do that we have the ability to recognize who we are and where we stand you know in Genesis 3:14 it says and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and we know that this is when they had actually done the thing in the garden which God told them not to do you shouldn't eat of that one tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil but what I want to say here is why was the serpent cursed to do what it does today if God's handing out the curses there why was the serpent cursed to be a serpent why was he just the same how could that be it doesn't make sense does it but we know through revelation we know through the ability to see the word of God we know that the serpent wasn't just a snake wasn't just on the ground eating dust crawling around and slithering up through trees like the pictures would depict the serpent was a beast he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field he had the ability to come and present himself you know what we've heard is that this Beast was actually more masculine than man more strong more a able more more more willing to actually do stuff to be a tiller of the ground to help manage you know God didn't create man to go and sweat with his brow to go and till the field in the garden to pull out all the weeds did he because that didn't come until the curse once the curse came then God said only then will you eat bread by the sweat of your brow excuse me so something happened we know I don't really want to go too far into it I just think it's amazing because we can see that you know there was a curse that was put on this one in verse 15 and I will put enemity between thee and the woman why would he do that if they just ate fruit why would he put emnity between thee and the woman why would that be there and between thy seed and her seed why would there be enemity between them and the seed if they just ate fruit it just doesn't make sense it just you can't even really understand it thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and we know that this scripture right here brothers and sisters talking about the Royal seed talking about the seed it actually speaks about another seed and we know that that seed was Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ came and you know that that that seed of Jesus Christ he came and and and he did what he needed to do he was able to come and I just love it because brother Bram says that he was the fullness the word of God says it too he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so how can you say that Jesus isn't God we could go on a on a big discussion about that but we know that some people want to do that we're not here to do that today I just uh I think about this other seed and I think about the seed for the people today and and I can't help but think that you know there is a stature of a perfect man someone that's filled with the Holy Ghost and someone that's filled with the Holy Ghost that matches that description of of having the stature of a perfect man we need to make sure that we're clear it's not having a statue of a perfect man in this flesh right this flesh will never be perfect never we're not making Grace a disgrace we're not making any room for sin what we want to do is talk about how Having the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we have the Holy Ghost in our lives this flesh will automatically become subject to our spirit and our spirit won't even be our spirit it will be his spirit that will actually be causing the direction in our lives because we will say Lord if thou wi then I will we won't just be running out and doing and we would save ourselves a whole lot of trouble if we would do that more often Lord willing I'll do that am but when we're filled with the Holy Ghost it's not it's not that someone is better than anyone there's no elitism if we see somebody puffed up we know the word of God says that you know real Revelation doesn't puff you up we know the prophet for our day he said true Revelation doesn't puff people up when we see puffed up people we know there's something wrong they're just they're just not right there yet they haven't quite made that place of of the Statue of the perfect man and what I'm saying is they're not climbing a ladder they're not building a house God's building the house amen what they haven't done yet is fully surrendered to the word in their day we haven't fully surrendered to the life of Jesus Christ true Revelation humbles a believer in second Peter verse one second Peter chapter 1 sorry verse 9 maybe if you have that brother I'll just pause and we'll we'll bring that up as we bring it in for a close here soon there we are you know we talk about the Statue of the perfect man and we know that that's the the scriptures prior to this but verse 9 says but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged of his old sins verse 10 says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly amen into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah isn't that wonderful to think that we've been given the instruction right there brothers and sisters we know that it's not anything that we've done in our lives and never could be anything that we've done or will do in our lives it's because he's chosen us just like he chose Jacob the Shyer amen over his brother who had the birthright who came out first but Esau have I hated and Jacob have I loved so that election might stand so that he could demonstrate that there's people that he's Chosen and there's people that he hasn't Chosen and that's the way it works we can't put anybody in or put anybody out we want to actually pray that everyone would be in we would that all would come unto salvation but I just think verse 10 is like a critical key maybe like a little bit of a keystone we talked about maybe just a little one not the Keystone but a little one wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure don't be looking at other people's calling in elections don't worry about them just get your own right because we preach this gospel we are written Epistles read of all men and when we're saying one thing and not con rently living another what happens we've got that mixed signal that mixed message and it causes confusion that's where people stumble at the word many people think stumbling at the word is the preaching of the word and sometimes it is sometimes it isn't but many times it's the life that's lived people hear this word they hear the message of the hour but then they see people act a certain way that doesn't line up with this message and it causes confusion causes questions but you know what if we would just take our time and make sure that we we diligently work out our own salvation work out our own calling and election diligently you know what the world would be a better place and when we do that so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly not just a little bit but abundantly an entrance will be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that's where I think true rest comes from isn't it when we come to that place when that entrance has been made to us when we've worked out our own salvation with fear and trembling when we know that we know that we know there's nothing ever good going to be inside of us except for him that that blood cell that he's broken for us that he's caused in in that heart that special place that we've been given by God for him to live in when he comes and lives in us we've been given that Everlasting Kingdom it's just a peace amen peace that passes all understanding peace like a river peace where we know that we don't have to fight the battles hallah he's fought the Battle all we need to do is make sure that we've got the token amen working it out with fear and trembling working out that salvation with fear and trembling and that's what that is brothers and sisters don't think that salvation for us as the Bride of Jesus Christ is just simply making it to the other side even though it is we are actually working on our salvation with fear and trembling to get the token because without the token you're not going to the other side that's right we know the word of God says that it would be better for those who have not even heard this message of the hour than to actually just partially accept it and then reject the parts they don't like because we're going to see people leave here and wonder wow I missed it we had the ability we were right there people that I knew people that I loved what are they doing now they're on the other side and I'm still here brother Bram says what will they preach in questions and answers the questions asked to him what will they preach after the Rapture and he says they'll preach the same thing what is it that they're preaching I don't know I could only imagine that as a prophet he had insight into that maybe it's some kind of a psychological spin maybe it's some kind of a self-help Guru mixed in with the message anything hybrid with the message I believe would do that that's why brothers and sisters don't look at one another don't look at me don't look at anybody don't even look too closely at the prophet look to Jesus look to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen but we know for sure the prophet pointed to Jesus Christ right he gave us the best example that we probably ever will see since Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we know that his late son said that you couldn't tell who his friends were or his enemies were I say Lord help me be that way help me be like that and and we know that he was the wave sheath right waved over top of the congregation to show this is what maturity looks like hallelu when the crop is mature this is what we're going to look like we're not going to be having healing campaigns but brothers and sisters as the Royal Seed of Abraham with the revelation of the word we can go forward and speak the word and know that it's already been conquered and know that he's already willing to back it up we don't have to heal anybody neither can we but he's already done it we know that Satan from the very beginning when we talked about this seed here he tried to interrupt God's program God allowed him to do it and why did he do it so he could express himself in Genesis 4:25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son called his name Seth for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel who came slooh and to Seth to him also there was born a son and called his name Enos then began men to call upon the name name of the Lord then began men to call upon the name of the Lord that scriptural identification of the spiritual Royal Seed of Abraham the spiritual seed Isaiah 7 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel another seed the Royal seed that we've been talking about spoken of by a prophetic utterance we know Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come Smite the Earth with a curse amen that prophetic utterance went forth hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago today and here we are brothers and sisters as the the manifested attributes of that prophecy 1 Peter 2 verse 9 but ye are Cho chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people we weren't a people but that Royal Seed of Abraham amen was created so that we could be a people so that we could be called from darkness which in time past were not a people but now are the people of God which hath not obtained Mercy Mercy but now hath obtained Mercy today brothers and sisters there's another seed and this is our seed this is our identification and now I feel like I'm just getting started and uh here we are I realize that clock is not actually slow today my goodness cuz I could I feel like we could go for another hour we okay for another hour I won't do it to us but I do have a couple more minutes if it's okay are we okay for a few more minutes the exposition of the seven Church ages I just want to talk about who you are we laid a bit of a background and I know I feel like I've bounced around a little bit I hope it's made a little bit of of encouraging sense but you know out of the exposition of the seven Church ages out of the saman church age according to Romans 4:16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed I think it's just beautiful we're talking about this in the back study without knowing that this is what we're coming to talk about God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed remember the word sure Bas ality steadfast strong a sure promise to Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and and all believers under that designation because he says Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not to only narrow down his definition but to rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of of God Amen and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated forn of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts is that you this morning amen yes it in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season I just want to say this Satan's going to say no you didn't but he's a liar right if you have the ability to hear the message of the hour and something keeps pulling us something keeps holding me amen every day I see amen when that happens brothers and sisters you were in the forn knowledge of God this is you that he's talking about this is the Bride of Jesus Christ right here the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season we could say well my mother my father my grandma my grandpa God knew all about that from before the foundation of the world don't look at the natural look at the spiritual you're the Royal Seed of Abraham you were in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body are you manifesting God in your life brothers and sisters oh my that's such a heavy statement it's so sobering to think if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ then we are manifesting God and there's no two ways about that we're not going to be us today and God tomorrow be God today brothers and sisters amen get that word inside of you today so that you can be mad manifesting God tomorrow cuz if you don't have it today it's not going to happen tomorrow who knows what tomorrow holds now it could happen tomorrow don't get me wrong but I want to say this if you have God in you you have God in you you're not just going to go out and get God you're not just going to go and get saved one day you always were saved you just realized it amen so I'm saying try and realize it today brothers and sisters I'm hoping that we can realize it sooner than later because the sooner that we recognize this the sooner that we go amen yes my now manifesting in a member me many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ goodness I'll call the musicians continuing on in the exposition of the seven Church ages the four the saman church age brother bam says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and the those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall he just sums it up right here we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore therefore we reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the only reason we could be quickened right in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken Cain's race because when Cain brought the Magnificent sacrifice onto god of the fruits of the land it would have been magnificent God Saidi not into it it's not what I desire it's not what I want right I want what your brother brought if you would just do like him but remember Cain had nothing in his heart to receive that right there was nothing in him to receive it just like the children of Israel there was nothing in their hearts to mix with the faith there was no faith in their hearts to mix with that word that came from the prophet in their day and that's why every one of them remained in the wilderness we know that when Jesus stood before them and he said you know what if you knew Abraham you claim him as your father as that seed but if you knew Abraham then you would believe the words that he spoke about me because I am the one that he spoke about and if you were that seed then you would believe in me but you know what every single one of those fathers are dead and we know that the prophet of God in our day said that that meant eternally separated it wasn't just that they hit the grave and and they're asleep and one day they're just going to come out of the grave and everything will be fine because they're of Israel no they're actually eternally separated and we know that that's the Final Act of the final play is to be eternally separated am we don't have to do that brothers and sisters we've been given the ability to be called because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened there's something in us that responds to that word and that's what we were talking about in the back this morning maybe stand with me as we close there is something inside of us that responds to the word you know in in in in the scripture that we had talked about earlier on maybe last week Flesh and Blood have not revealed these things there's not flesh and blood inside of us that says Amen to that word to the world we sound crazy we sound like Fanatics like lunatics people would say there's something wrong with you severely but the inside of the inside says it doesn't matter what anybody says cuz I've met him and I know that this word is true and when we can he that it's this rock of Revelation brothers and sisters that he builds his church on and that's why we can say it's not this Church Calgary Living Word that gives us the Revelation it it's not it's not saying that I accepted the message of the hour at a certain time at a certain place in a certain area and and that gives me the Salvation it's this rock of Revelation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's the Keystone of the Bible that he is my ever PR in tense I am in my life and when that happens thy seed you shall possess the Gate of your enemy your enemy will not Prevail over top of you brothers and sisters so I want to say it this morning this is my desire go possess the gates of your enemies as we dismiss this morning let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word thank you for the many representations Lord Jesus that you've given throughout the ages yes Lord and father we know that it comes to the culmination of you manifesting your self through your body your body of Believers Lord
