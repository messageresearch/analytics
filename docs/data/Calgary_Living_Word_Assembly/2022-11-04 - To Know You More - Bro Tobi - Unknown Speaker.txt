========================================
speak El silver month has been really in my mind but it's not just been a song it's been um what God has been doing helping me to realize that what's most important in life is knowing Jesus and I know our pastor has been talking about how he has been focused on drawing closer to God and that's been my my aim and my objective as well and I've seen God work out some wonderful things just to show me that if I could draw closer to him then it will manifest himself more and I just want to sing this special um as a testimony and also a confession [Music] all I once held dear build my life upon all this world rivers and Wars to own all I want stored gain I have counted laws spanked and walk left now compared to these knowing you Jesus [Music] knowing you very you're my own you're the best you're my joy my righteousness and I love you Lord now my hearts these are is to know you more to be found in you as known as yours to possess my faith [Music] of righteousness [Music] knowing you Jesus knowing you you reach no Grace you're my old you're the best you're my joy my righteousness and I love you Lord oh to know the part of your reasons [Music] become like you in your death my Lord so with you to leave and never die knowing you Jesus going here there is no breather thing you're my own you're the best you're my joy my righteousness and I love you Lord [Music] you're my all you're the best you're my joy my righteousness and I love you Lord [Music] [Applause] God bless you judge I was really wavering on what whether to sing this song or not tonight giving them a bit out of breath and tired um but I've been um having this song on my mind um especially as we've been talking about the uh the conduct of children in the last couple Wednesdays the pastor preaching about all of that um and I remember the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ saying uh very Legacy unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter bearing and there's this old song old old song that we used to sing um you will always be a child in my eyes so it's not really a special song So if you know it please sing with me tonight [Music] I was there when you drew the bread of life [Music] I could hear your voice I force them that you cried and though you couldn't see me I was very near something now that I want you to know [Music] you will always be a child in my eyes when you need some love my arms are open wide even when you grow we know I hope you realize you will always be child in and I was there first time Dad you prayed and I heard all the promises you made and when you fell before me crying father I have seen picked you up how'd you close again you will always be a child in my eyes but when you need some love my hands are open wide [Music] even when you're growing old I hope you realize you will always be a child in my eyes sing with me you will always be a child in my eyes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]
