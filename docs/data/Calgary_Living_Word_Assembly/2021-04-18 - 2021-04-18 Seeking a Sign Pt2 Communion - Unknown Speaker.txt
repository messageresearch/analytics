little service tonight we pray that you would just take all the awkward out of the way we pray that you would just help us to get past all the unfamiliar we pray that we could just push back all the powers of Darkness that would try and come against us from following your word and we pray that you would just bless each and every one sovereignly according to your will we just ask that you would be glorified most of all Lord Jesus that there wouldn't be another sign that we're looking for because we've been given the entire sign we've been given an open Word father we pray that you would just be glorified now Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you extremely thank you so much if you have your Bibles tonight we'll just read a little bit I'd like to go back to the The Book of Luke chapter 16 if we can and uh I'm gonna do something a little strange but I think that's what this is the the years of coven strange um maybe just one person if you could if we're together can you just honk your horn I know there's a bit of a delay but I'm wondering if uh if we're streaming if we're together Hallelujah that's wonderful let's turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter 16. we'll start reading from verse 19. and we'll go down to verse 31. there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes and being in torments he seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom isn't it just interesting that he had a real conscious recognition of everyone that he saw especially these two verse 24. and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this Flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he's comforted and thou art tormented beside all this between us and you there was a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hands to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldstas send him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they would repent and he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither would they be persuaded though one rose from the dead let's just bow in prayer once again gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you have given us years to hear Lord we never want to take it for granted what you've done for each and every one of us Lord to think that it's only by your grace that we are able to hear the voice of the prophet in our day we know that you never change your program we know that Satan manipulates man and influences man to change your program but you change not that heavens and earth will pass away but you your words will remain and father as much as we are a part of you we can never be lost what a consolation that is father tonight I pray that you would just bless the few words that we speak and more than anything I pray that you would receive the glory in the actions of everyone's Faith who has come out tonight Lord Jesus to give you the glory to partake in your supper we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may uh have your seats Luke chapter 16 talking about the Rich Young Ruler it's kind of where we left off this morning and I'll try not to go too long now but I just wanted to continue on with seeking a sign and really what the stimulation for this whole discussion was for me was twofold it was seeing these ministers who were going on about their their the one having a great ministry and people elevating him and and so on and another Minister throwing off on on that Minister for the allowing the influence to go on and and me sort of being caught in the middle seeing it saying Lord where's the balance in all of this how does it how does it work and and for him to show me in the message not because I asked him even just because I was in the word feeding he showed me the answer and that is to Simply distance oneself from it and say no that's not acceptable there's only one person that deserves worship and that's the Lord Jesus Christ God almighty Elohim so I just wanted to take a little bit and talk about it and uh you know there's there's folks now today that are talking about seeing the signs around us and is the vaccine the the mark of the beast worldly there's people that were raised in religion and and talking about this and saying that there's a genetic code in the in the vaccine that that that that has the number 666 on it and isn't that interesting that the prophet never said anything about that the prophet for our day he identified 666 and it's the the Roman numerals that are written in Latin I believe it is in the Vatican on the triple crown and I'm sorry it it it it eludes me right now but I can find it for you I'm sure there's a brother that could probably say it right now you know but that's what it is it's a number of a man and we had a prophet clearly identified he didn't say that it was a genetic code inside a vaccine so we need to be very careful what we're feeding on and that's really the one thing that I wanted to get at that was the most important thing sometimes people can share things on the internet via text or whatever just forward something quickly and flippantly and I know that I've been guilty of doing it but brothers and sisters we have to be careful the information that we do that with because all of the information that we get and receive and and filters through is not expedient information it's not going to direct people necessarily to the message of the hour it can be the influence of a devil in a person's life and sometimes we as Believers can actually represent a false witness something that's not actually accurate according to the message of the hour it's interesting a lot of the stuff that we see it's very interesting we can see a lot of interesting things a lot of interesting events unfolding around us you know I I if we want to say we're looking for a sign we want to see that there's a sign we know that there is a discussion around the message of the hour that Billy Paul said his daddy said that you know by the time you're an old man sharks will be swimming in in this building and I believe it was the May building and there's an actual documented article that's on the internet now that says that there was an earthquake and I think it was in 1980 or maybe even earlier there was an earthquake that happened and water from the ocean got in and a shark or two was actually swimming in the basement of that building that very building that brother Branham said that about what my point is is if we're waiting for a cataclysmic California slipping into the ocean because that building is going to have sharks swimming in the basement of it according to the oral tradition that was shared with brother Branham to his son to all the other people that actually caught wind of it and heard it if we're looking for that sort of a sign it's already happened if we're looking for the coming of the Lord brothers and sisters something happened on Sunset mountain in 1963. and I don't really want to get into that too far tonight but what I do want to get into is just being careful about what we're sharing to one another we should share the word we should share the message of the hour I mean there's events that happen in this world and sometimes they're staggering to look at and many times if we don't actually go and seek it out we might not see it if we don't check the news regularly if we're not constantly scouting the news looking for an earthquake or looking for some sort of a world event which is what I've been guilty of doing and I'm just talking about myself here but because of that we can open ourselves up to a plethora of things that don't help us that distract us from the word that take us away from the main focus at hand and that should be winning Souls saving people taking as many people with us as we can but now especially with the age of Technology it's so easy to send things it's so easy to receive things and you know what the things that we receive are not always the things that we should send and I just want to leave it at that we need to be very careful about the things that we send because they might send the wrong message and maybe the most most of the people that we talk to and hang out with could be just fine but what if I forwarded something myself that actually came from Brother Barry and somebody knows that whatever he's a affiliated with a church or a pastor or some position in a church and it wasn't really expedient about the message of the hour I could actually potentially steer someone away from really understanding what I believe just by what I forwarded and it's like two clicks right maybe three we just want to be careful don't seek a sign the greatest sign that we could ever have has been given and that sign is the opening of the word that sign is the sign that was given to the prophet Jonas the discernment of Hearts it was given to Abraham the Discerning of Hearts understanding that you know the son of man Ministry is on Earth again it's here and and and it's going soon very soon I did share something now I'm going to say what I did share and if anybody's interested I could actually share it to you it's it's a video clip from from the brother I'll call him a brother the Messianic Jew that I know in Israel I've met him online and he sends updates regularly like every other every day or every other day is is his name online but he sent a video clip of them singing in front of the Wailing Wall and when you hear the entire Voice come together as one can you not imagine what that sounds like Before the Throne of God to think that there are people now in Israel coming together as one and you know how does the Lord deal with Israel he deals with them as a nation as one and the Gentiles he deals with as individuals but to just stand and or sit or however you want and and see that video and hear the sound of that singing it sounds like one with a tremendous voice all together before the Wailing Wall coming together with one Unity of spirit to think brothers and sisters the anointing is raising their and the anointing is leaving here and it's just going to be like that the secret silent going away of the Bride catching away of the Bride is not going to be the big cataclysmic events don't think that we're going to see something and that's going to trigger us to behave a different way and then we're going to get right with God and get to church and go to communion and do whatever we need to do if that's what we're going to do we're going to miss it it's going to just go like a thief in the night just like the scripture said you know the end of this year verse 31 of this story about Lazarus and the rich man and he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets if we don't hear the prophet today if we don't hear the pastors that preach the message of the hour if we're too busy getting hung up on the pastors of the message of the hour and saying well that Pastor he drives the Cadillac and that Pastor well he's just got a nice suit and that Pastor he's he's just got a house that nobody should have how could people have that kind of money brothers and sisters were just completely missing the point we're letting the devil hang one on us we should be separating ourselves from that we should be well beyond all of that as mature Christians understanding which that that which is perfect has come and we have the ability to partake of it we should be looking to Christ and saying you know what maybe that brother he's got way more money than I'll ever have but that's only because God could trust him with it and maybe he couldn't trust me with it maybe it would be enough to actually send me to hell just like that Rich Young Ruler where I wouldn't be able to let go of it all and and and say that you know just like we read this morning I believe it was in Matthew the same story from a different perspective a different account he was perfect in all of his ways and Jesus loved him when he saw him and he said you know if you want to just be perfect just do the one thing just get rid of all of it throw away your Traditions throw away your family inheritance throw away all the money that you've got and just give it to the poor and come and follow me how many people today would do that even if they met Jesus Christ in flesh and he told them to do that how many people would do that oh I don't know it would be challenging because as as people we're taught that we have to provide for our families as men we're worse than an Infidel if we don't provide for our families but to have a man tell us just throw it all away throw in the garbage just give it to the poor they need it and come and follow me you know that's exactly according to the scripture though seek ye first the kingdom of God and he'll add all the rest unto us all the rest of it unto us and you know we we were talking about it I think this morning about it being more than just finances more than just money more than just the the The Riches of this world it's the tradition forget about what you think you know and how perfect you are in all of your ways and all the all the Pharisee training that you've had and all the doctrines that's been given to you you might be perfect in the law be not perfect in my eyes is what Jesus said you've got something major holding you back but if you want to be perfect just get rid of it and you know that's the point that I wanted to get to kind of the punch line we need to forget about all the traditional teaching that we have all of the things that we think we know if we bring them and drag them over into the message of the hour and think that we're going to get the right results we're not going to get the right results those those are a little bit of Leaven is what the scripture says and a little bit of Leaven does what it leavens the whole lump it might not happen right away it might just be a little bit but it just takes a teeny little bit a speck of it one Spore of it to get in there and it just takes time it might be a day it might be a week it might be a month it might be a year it might be a decade but it'll happen eventually it'll just grow and take over and the cares of this life will become more important that's why brothers and sisters just a free side note it is vital it's not just important it is absolutely earth-shatteringly vital not only to make sure that you get the Holy Ghost but if you're looking for a mate they need to have the Holy Ghost that has got to be the pair amount factor in the equation you both need the holy ghost or do not get married it will not work you will not take a person who does not have the Holy Ghost and then train them into getting the holy ghost that will not work the person without the Holy Ghost will drag you all the way out into the world and tear your life apart and you'll have a situation where you'll think I wish that we would have had the Holy Ghost now I've got all this wreckage behind me children maybe that are upset a divorce on the go and now I have to drag my butt all the way back to church and try and face everyone when they tried to tell me this from the beginning but I'll tell you what as long as I'm around I'll say hey welcome I will never tell you so you know people don't need to hear that every single time in fact people don't need to hear I told you so but isn't it an interesting thing how human nature is people just want to tell people I told you so I told you that didn't I tell you that would happen parents classic statement to the children I told you that would happen we don't want to do that especially when it comes to the house of God especially when it comes to the gospel we want to welcome people we want to bring people to the Lord you know what sometimes people I'll say this maybe sometimes people they need to go and go through all of that wreckage in their lives to get to the place where God can actually put the Holy Ghost in them if they're a son and daughter of God we've heard it said sometimes God will pull you through the knot hole sideways but you'll come some people come easy some people come hard anyways if we can't hear the prophets just like this Rich Young Ruler we're not going to hear someone that comes back from the grave we're not going to hear someone that will actually come and tell us to just forget about all of your stuff and just sell it and and give it to the poor and then you know God will bless you it's going to be irrelevant if we can't hear the voice of a prophet you know don't seek assigned brothers and sisters we've been given the way we've been given the word for a reason and and that reason is so that we could receive the Holy Ghost as we've said this morning there's nothing more important to talk about than the Holy Ghost than getting the token in our lives we can talk about all the Deep Mysteries and the seals and and the Seven Church ages and the Seven unknown Thunders and all the Mysteries that were contained in those seven unknown Thunders and all the stuff the 70 weeks of Daniel we can get into all of the doctrinal things that we understand that are are really deep mysterious things in terms of the message but if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's just theology it's just an action of learning and being able to retain information and then being able to give it out and typically what happens if people don't have the Holy Ghost they want to spar with it they want to say I know more than you and I I'll go quote to quote with you man you know what good is that it's got nothing to do with the message of the hour it's got nothing to do with Christ we we said it this morning if you don't have charity in your life if you don't have Divine love if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's all for nothing no matter how much we give to the poor no matter how much we do we've been given the open word in our day we've been given the absolute ultimate sign for our day and it's not the cloud necessarily and it's not William Branham necessarily and it's not the message necessarily and it's not the church that we would attend that would claim to preach the message necessarily all of that combined but what it is the super sign brothers and sisters we've all heard it I know it is you Christ in you the hope of glory that's the super sign you we are living witness of the message of the hour that Christ has Grace for this age too and we have the ability to show that to people to impart that Christ still has Grace but you know what time is running out that clock is ticking and and you know we've heard it said many times it's it's how many minutes to midnight on the atomic clock how many minutes to midnight how many seconds now I would say to midnight is it how many people can we bring to heaven with us I want to throw that challenge out there how many people can we share the message of the hour with how many people can we witness to and and and get to come to see the message of the hour some people might come because they're excited because of our excitement some people might come because they think that we're nice people some people might come because they see just a blessing around being with a good group of people but there's others that might come because they want the true token they want the Holy Ghost and those are the ones that were after brothers and sisters but you know we're after them all because we can give people the opportunity to see eternal life just on the way they treat us so we have the ability to actually give them the opportunity to be nice to us so if someone asks you if you want a glass of water take it because even a cup of cold water will be remembered on the other side we've been given the greatest sign ever we've been given the sign that we were able to receive the spirit of adoption that we might be able to receive the spirit of Truth that we might be able to receive the Holy Ghost and if we've received the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it's not optional this is so it's just I believe this is so critical it's not optional this part is not optional I think sometimes it's almost implied like it is or it's maybe just not preached this way I don't know maybe it's just me in my my weird way but I don't believe ghost and and to not have the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word we have a maturing process but if we have the Holy Ghost then we have the mind of Christ it's no longer us thinking it's him thinking in US and I think it's a an astounding thought really to think about but it's true how could we have the Holy Ghost how could we have the Holy Spirit how could we be adopted Sons and Daughters of God and not have his mind in us I just don't think it's possible I do believe that's where brother Branham said that very few people will go on to the true baptism of the Holy Spirit it's just a staggering thought to think about but I believe it's encouraging too because that's what every one of us wants and I don't think that there's anybody here or in the parking lot tonight or anyone else that Tunes in that listens to us perhaps who is a member of this congregation a member of the mystical body of Jesus Christ who doesn't have the Holy Ghost I would that everyone would I think that somebody with the Holy Ghost will always treat everyone as though they do we're not going to go around and try and slam people and treat them like they don't that's that's that's an antichrist spirit I would not accept that that's that's not right we want everyone to go on to see that blessing in their lives but you know he's given us the mind of Christ if we have the Holy Spirit in our lives that we would know what to do with the word because we've been given the prophet who actually showed us the word is open it's a completely open word to us we don't have to to walk on pins and needles we don't have to have a big long prayer meeting because something has happened in our lives back in Moses day we know that Jesus told them speak the word and go forward why are you talking to me why why cry speak we've had the Prophet come and and open the word be used to open the word to us but sometimes I feel like it it almost seems like we need to go backwards and and and and cry instead of just speak the word because we have the mind of Christ we don't want to do that don't say When I See This or when I see that then I'll act because if we do that brothers and sisters we're going to miss it and I would say potentially we've already missed it if we're saying that today potentially we've already missed it we've been we've been given so much in our day you know I I feel like I could just keep going on and on and on and on and I could and I'm not going to tonight I just wanted to just try and encourage each one of us to be very cautious what we pass around don't look for a sign don't think that we're going to do something different when we see something else because I've said it before and I'll say it again this and and maybe not this right here the amount of people in here but this what we have are lives that we've met all of the brothers and sisters who've come from all the different countries in the world and we we gather together around the message of the hour brothers and sisters this is it man we're not going to see a great move it's not going to be a great Revival maybe there'll be more people that come to the church who knows maybe there will be another church building maybe this will grow maybe there will be other Church buildings in the City of Calgary if the Lord should who knows what what could potentially happen if the Lord should tarry but there isn't going to be a great message Revival happen in this world that's happened that ship has sailed it's gone the only thing left the prophet said that he sees for the Gentile church is the rapture of the so we just want to make sure that we have oil in our lamps the shout's already gone forth behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps that's already happened brothers and sisters it's history now now there's people out there looking for oil but they won't receive it when you tell them if you come according to the message of Malachi 4 if you come according to if you come according to Revelations 10 7 you have the opportunity to receive the Holy Ghost you have the opportunity to get oil in your lap and still trim it while there's time many times people just don't want to hear it because they've got their tradition and you know what they're going to wind up just like that Rich Young Ruler we don't want to be that that guy tonight I just want to thank everyone for making the effort to come out I know this is weird and this is like I said the years for weird 2020 2021 it doesn't look like there's any let up in sight it looks like it's getting worse and there's going to be more clampdowns and restrictions or whatever we don't know what's going to happen nobody knows it was just last week I was talking to a brother maybe a week before he was telling me how good it was in another province that everything is open and it's too bad you guys are all closed and now this week a week later now they're closed too we happen we have no idea the only thing that we know is there's a Rapture coming and the only thing that we know is that we have oil and the only thing that we know is that we can just continue on and the trajectory that we're at and we'll see the apostolic blessing in our lives we won't be left behind I thought I've been thinking about this recently isn't it interesting I'm just going to throw this out there and then maybe I'll ask sister Emily to come will close in a word of prayer and just change the order of the service here I just was thinking about it isn't it interesting and and and and it's probably absolutely nothing it's just me pondering but you get my thoughts for free um it's interesting that there's only 12 people allowed in this building yeah yeah actually I plan on that brother 100 percent yeah it's interesting just to see the the the the numbers and I I don't know maybe it's just me I can be a little weird that way maybe stand with me tonight as we do change the order of the service let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for your grace and we're thankful for your mercy we're thankful for each and every life that's represented here tonight Lord Jesus father in in fact for me it's humbling [Music] week after week we look at the the chairs being empty here father and don't really know where everything stands but we know that it is all in your control it has been all along and it will be until the end and father I pray that tonight you would just pour out a special blessing upon your children father each and every one who has made the effort to come out I pray that this service would be a special service Lord we've gone over a year trying to abide by the laws and trying to find our way and figure out the new normal and Lord we just we just have to try something we have to make an effort and and here we are and Lord I would pray that you would forgive me if I have been a hindrance to allowing this to happen but father all's we can do is is go forwards now so I pray that Lord you would just be pleased with this part of our service now that you would just bless each and every one as we come through we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen so we have uh a bit of a process that we're going to do Brothers how many people can we bring in [Music] okay [Music] all right so the brothers are going to cue the people from the parking lot into the foyer and then from the foyer into the sanctuary and uh we will have two of the brothers come and serve the communion I believe it's brother Emmanuel and brother Toby is that right Brothers if you would come at this time the people who do come in will have you come in on the piano side up to the front partake of the bread then a glass of wine the deacons will serve you both of those if you just hold out your hand they'll give them to you please don't reach in to grab anything and once you've taken the wine you can deposit it in the waste basket by the door and just exit out the ramp I'm sorry we can't have a testimony service I'm sorry we can't have a foot washing I'm sorry we can't just sing our hearts out like we would but we'll try and make the best of it so God bless you tonight we'll just ask the brothers to bless the the supper here if you want to just break it while you pray I'll hold the mic I gotta set that down [Music] sorry about our hearts before him merciful Lord God Almighty how faithful and true you are Lord we thank you for this evening for this time it's so precious Lord that father your children are defined All Odds to prove that your love has prevailed to God you are faithful you are true yes if anybody had any desire not to be here the devil has given him more than enough reason but father you have called us you have chosen us that even in the midst of a pandemic and all distractions for that I wish you fulfill your word and still stay within the Lord Lord we just love you it's a special privilege of God and so father even as we bless this bread just like you blessed it oh God we pray in Jesus Christ name that you will bless the actual body of the Lord Jesus Christ of God that your presence will be with every single family out there oh God that father when they are in there your presence will be with their bless them protect them guide them lead them oh God and grant us all your victory we know you're keeping power has brought us therefore this far and it will continue to be oh God all the way home so we say Lord let your will be done we appreciate your merciful father even as we invite you now take control of every aspect of what we're doing and may it be pleasing to you even as we try to remember you according to your ordinance in Jesus Christ's name do we pray amen dear Lord we thank you for the opportunity to also partake of the wine which is said that this is Lord Jesus Christ the blood of your Covenant we pray the Lord Jesus that the Lord that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel that has cleansed us Lord Jesus from our unrighteousness lord Jesus and given us the righteousness of God himself as we partake of this tonight dear Lord Jesus do we feel Lord Jesus Christ that righteousness that is not ours but yours Lord Jesus received from the purification by the blood of the Lamb yes may we lord Jesus receive strength dear Lord Jesus not just their father in our bodies but also Lord Jesus in our spirit man their father to live the life of Christ for the world to see and then be glorified tonight in Jesus Christ's number three amen thank you I'll just read the scripture as we commence with this in First Corinthians chapter 11. verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him
