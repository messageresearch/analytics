[1:10:32] thank you

[1:10:41] blessed be the name of the Lord God
[1:10:43] bless you this morning welcome to the
[1:10:45] house of the Lord once again
[1:10:48] on a beautiful Sunday morning
[1:10:51] even though it's overcast
[1:10:53] and the leaves aren't all the way out
[1:10:56] we know that it's very green and the sun
[1:10:59] is shining somewhere
[1:11:01] real close to here
[1:11:04] we have a few prayer requests that we'd
[1:11:06] like to bring before the church this
[1:11:08] morning
[1:11:11] brother Paul and sister Elaine
[1:11:13] have contracted covid
[1:11:16] and they're at home with it quarantining
[1:11:18] going through the hole
[1:11:21] whole rigmarole that we're doing in our
[1:11:23] lives now
[1:11:24] and uh
[1:11:26] you know the song that we just sang it
[1:11:29] really sums it up
[1:11:32] how we've learned to trust in Jesus
[1:11:36] and and how we trust him more and
[1:11:39] how do we do that
[1:11:42] by the trials that he brings
[1:11:44] that's how we learn to trust in him
[1:11:47] we don't learn to trust in him by just
[1:11:49] simply going to church and simply
[1:11:51] reading the scripture and simply saying
[1:11:54] that I believe
[1:11:56] we know we've said it before many times
[1:11:58] talk is cheap it's when we can actually
[1:11:59] believe in the Valley of the situation
[1:12:03] that's when it shows Who We Are
[1:12:06] it's pretty easy to believe when we're
[1:12:08] on the mountaintops
[1:12:09] we're just so thankful that brother Paul
[1:12:11] and sister Elaine aren't really sick
[1:12:14] they've indicated that it's like a bad
[1:12:16] cold or even just like a mild cold I
[1:12:19] think it's not a terrible thing for them
[1:12:22] well trust that the Lord will just
[1:12:23] continue watching over them
[1:12:25] that the angel of the Lord will just
[1:12:27] stay right there
[1:12:28] at Wood Glen Place just long enough
[1:12:32] to restore their strength
[1:12:35] and bring them back again
[1:12:38] let's just uh
[1:12:40] let's just bow in prayer
[1:12:44] gracious Heavenly Father we're just so
[1:12:46] thankful for your grace and your mercy
[1:12:48] in each one of our Lives Lord
[1:12:50] every single one of us
[1:12:52] we all rely upon that very same Grace
[1:12:56] that you have bestowed upon your
[1:12:58] children
[1:12:59] Lord there's not one of us that has any
[1:13:02] special favor with you because you're
[1:13:04] not a respecter of persons
[1:13:07] you are a respecter of your word
[1:13:10] and father I pray Lord we pray this
[1:13:14] morning a special prayer that your
[1:13:15] children would be found speaking your
[1:13:18] word

[1:13:22] we're in an age that hasn't been
[1:13:25] since before the foundation of the world
[1:13:28] this is the age of the coming of the
[1:13:31] Lord
[1:13:32] your Prophet said that he's not looking
[1:13:33] for a Revival but he's looking for the
[1:13:36] coming of the Lord

[1:13:40] already happened

[1:14:02] lives Lord Jesus that you would just
[1:14:05] pick them up on the wings of the eagle
[1:14:07] and that you would just cast out all
[1:14:10] fear and doubt Lord that there would be

[1:15:24] be no room for Satan to come around and
[1:15:27] try and tempt them and and make them

[1:18:20] you musicians
[1:18:21] so wonderful to have musicians
[1:18:24] to be able to sing unto the Lord
[1:18:27] if you could turn to the gospel of Saint
[1:18:30] John chapter 1.
[1:18:32] and then we'll turn over to the book of
[1:18:34] Colossians chapter one
[1:18:41] what a tremendous day it is that we live
[1:18:43] in here
[1:18:44] certainly an honor and a privilege to
[1:18:47] understand the day that we live and that
[1:18:50] it's no ordinary day
[1:18:54] we've been spending a fair bit of time
[1:18:57] in the Book of John I believe there's
[1:18:58] just so very much in here
[1:19:00] today I'd like to read
[1:19:03] just from
[1:19:05] verse 12.
[1:19:07] of John chapter 1.
[1:19:10] to verse 18 and then over in the book of
[1:19:13] Colossians chapter 1.
[1:19:18] verse 12.
[1:19:21] but as many as received him
[1:19:24] to them gave he power to become
[1:19:27] the sons of God
[1:19:29] even to them that believe on his name
[1:19:32] which were born
[1:19:34] not of blood not of the will of the
[1:19:37] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[1:19:42] and the Word was made flesh then dwelt
[1:19:44] Among Us
[1:19:45] and we beheld
[1:19:48] sorry and we beheld his glory the glory
[1:19:51] as of the only begotten of the father
[1:19:54] full of grace and truth
[1:19:57] John bear witness of him
[1:19:59] and cried saying
[1:20:01] this was he of whom I spake
[1:20:05] he that cometh after me is preferred
[1:20:07] before me
[1:20:09] for he was before me
[1:20:12] and of his fullness
[1:20:13] have we
[1:20:15] have all we received and Grace for Grace
[1:20:19] but the law was given by Moses but Grace
[1:20:22] and Truth came
[1:20:25] by Jesus Christ
[1:20:27] no man hath seen God at any time the
[1:20:31] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[1:20:34] of the father
[1:20:35] he hath declared him
[1:20:40] let's turn over to Colossians now
[1:20:43] Colossians chapter one just two verses
[1:20:47] verse 26 and verse 27.
[1:20:50] very familiar scriptures
[1:20:54] even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:20:57] from ages and from Generations
[1:21:00] but is now made manifest to his Saints
[1:21:04] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:21:07] riches
[1:21:08] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:21:10] Gentiles
[1:21:12] which is Christ in you
[1:21:16] the hope of glory
[1:21:17] let's just bow one more time
[1:21:20] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[1:21:22] so thankful for your word we're so
[1:21:24] thankful for
[1:21:25] a pure revelation of your word Lord for
[1:21:29] the opening of your word
[1:21:31] for sending us a prophet Lord that would
[1:21:33] be an instrument in your hand so that
[1:21:35] you could speak to us Lord we're
[1:21:37] thankful for your fivefold ministry Lord
[1:21:39] that would submit themselves unto your
[1:21:41] word that would surrender themselves
[1:21:43] unto the message of the hour and preach
[1:21:45] the truth
[1:21:47] Lord we're just so thankful
[1:21:49] that we can be the culmination of all of
[1:21:52] the ages
[1:21:54] in you
[1:21:55] we pray Lord Jesus that you would just
[1:21:57] take this word now and break it to us
[1:21:59] fresh once again
[1:22:01] that your children would be fed today
[1:22:03] help me Lord Jesus to just step aside
[1:22:06] and give you the preeminence that you
[1:22:08] desire
[1:22:09] speak that which you want spoken Lord
[1:22:11] Jesus we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:15] God bless you this morning you may have
[1:22:17] your seats
[1:22:21] we know that a few people in our
[1:22:22] congregation now have encountered this
[1:22:25] covid
[1:22:27] and uh we're certainly thankful for the
[1:22:29] healing touch of the Lord
[1:22:31] every one of us has a testimony of a
[1:22:35] miracle in our lives
[1:22:37] many people would say well science comes
[1:22:40] on the scene and helps us and yes indeed
[1:22:42] science does
[1:22:44] but we know that vaccine only comes
[1:22:46] because God allows it
[1:22:49] the only reason that there's science
[1:22:50] that actually helps us is because God
[1:22:53] imparts that wisdom into man
[1:22:56] Satan wants to destroy
[1:22:59] God wants to heal
[1:23:01] when we when we look at things in our
[1:23:04] lives we can easily get confused I think
[1:23:06] and and start to mix things up in a way
[1:23:09] that can can make God look like he's
[1:23:11] putting things on us and and make it
[1:23:13] look like Satan is going to heal Us by
[1:23:15] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:23:17] the only reason that there is a tree of
[1:23:19] knowledge of Good and Evil is because
[1:23:22] God placed it there in the garden that's
[1:23:24] the only reason
[1:23:25] it's not because of anything that Satan
[1:23:28] can do Satan is not a big monster
[1:23:30] remember there's coming a time and it's
[1:23:32] a scripture where men will walk by and
[1:23:35] see Satan on the sides of the pit and
[1:23:38] say that is the man that caused all of
[1:23:40] the anxiety throughout all of the ages
[1:23:43] that's what did it right there
[1:23:45] and wag their heads and walk away
[1:23:47] because he will have no power he will be
[1:23:49] powerless and and that time will come
[1:23:51] but brothers and sisters
[1:23:54] spiritually speaking that time is now
[1:23:57] and we have a prophet that brought that
[1:23:58] to us
[1:23:59] but we're so thankful for the Lord's
[1:24:01] Healing Touch in our lives every one of
[1:24:03] us has a testimony of times in our lives
[1:24:05] when we've been sick and we're no longer
[1:24:07] sick
[1:24:08] it's because God heals us
[1:24:11] what a mighty God we serve
[1:24:13] I just was thinking about this you know
[1:24:16] and how easy it can be
[1:24:18] to get caught up in fear and to think
[1:24:20] about how
[1:24:22] well people are dying because of covet
[1:24:24] and and all the different things and if
[1:24:26] something were to happen to us and
[1:24:27] perhaps we would find ourselves in a
[1:24:29] hospital even where all the bad germs
[1:24:32] are that we could simply contract
[1:24:34] something while we're there and and have
[1:24:36] such a a frightening time
[1:24:39] remember perfect love casts out all fear
[1:24:44] not some of fear and not most fear but
[1:24:47] all fear
[1:24:48] and if we we fear
[1:24:51] then do we have perfect love in our
[1:24:53] lives brothers and sisters
[1:24:55] there's times don't don't don't get me
[1:24:57] wrong as human beings there's times
[1:24:59] where things happen to us and I'll word
[1:25:01] it like this if in our camper we have a
[1:25:05] horn
[1:25:06] just just to make it a human example we
[1:25:08] have a horn in our camper and it's like
[1:25:10] a a gravel truck horn it's very loud
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:15] we could walk in front of it someone
[1:25:17] could walk in front of it and we could
[1:25:18] honk the horn and it will scare us it
[1:25:22] will cause fear if we're not expecting
[1:25:24] it
[1:25:26] that's what can happen to a believer
[1:25:29] we can be walking through our life and
[1:25:31] we can hear something a doctor might say
[1:25:33] well you have this or you could
[1:25:36] experience that or maybe something else
[1:25:39] happens in our life and and we have a
[1:25:41] moment of fear that doesn't mean we're
[1:25:43] not a Believer and that doesn't mean
[1:25:44] that we don't have perfect love what I'm
[1:25:46] saying is that when we have that perfect
[1:25:47] love when that fear tries to come down
[1:25:50] upon us and take us again in bondage
[1:25:53] because it's a spirit
[1:25:55] perfect love casts out that spirit
[1:25:57] perfect love cast away that fear perfect
[1:25:59] love gives us the ability to have that
[1:26:01] spoken word condition where we can say
[1:26:03] you know what that's not the word of God
[1:26:05] for me to be afraid of the situation God
[1:26:08] doesn't want us to be afraid of the
[1:26:09] situations in our lives he wants us to
[1:26:11] be Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:26:13] going to stand up and say it doesn't
[1:26:14] matter what happens I know that he's in
[1:26:17] control I know whom I have believed and
[1:26:20] that he is able to keep that
[1:26:23] which he has promised me
[1:26:26] not be afraid
[1:26:28] I just was thinking about that testimony
[1:26:29] of whether Gary Walker remember that
[1:26:31] terrible terrible terrible accident that
[1:26:33] he was in
[1:26:34] horrible accident
[1:26:37] and I believe his daughter wasn't really
[1:26:40] that injured even though her daddy was
[1:26:42] on the brink of death I think he had
[1:26:44] already died once or twice maybe in the
[1:26:46] wreck
[1:26:47] before the paramedics got him out and
[1:26:49] there was all the chaos and everything
[1:26:51] was going on around there and and the
[1:26:53] little daughter who was a Believer is
[1:26:55] the one that said it's going to be okay
[1:26:56] don't worry it's gonna be okay
[1:26:59] we're Believers right
[1:27:02] can you imagine that
[1:27:03] perfect love brothers and sisters it
[1:27:06] casts out all fear we have nothing to be
[1:27:08] afraid of it doesn't matter what the
[1:27:09] situation is
[1:27:11] and how do we get perfect love where
[1:27:13] does that come from brothers and sisters
[1:27:15] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] it's the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth
[1:27:21] it's Christ
[1:27:23] in us the hope of glory
[1:27:26] scripture that we read this morning
[1:27:28] we don't have to be afraid
[1:27:32] we'll get into our scriptures a little a
[1:27:33] little bit here but uh just wanted to
[1:27:36] remind everyone that there was a new
[1:27:37] baby in our midst this week brother baby
[1:27:40] Benjamin egmana
[1:27:43] to brother Samuel and sister Faith
[1:27:46] and Brother Joseph and brother Paul
[1:27:49] so now we have another family with three
[1:27:50] boys in it
[1:27:52] three boys God bless you brothers and
[1:27:55] sister
[1:27:57] it's truly a wonderful thing to have a
[1:27:59] child and
[1:28:01] begin to learn
[1:28:03] as a parent some of the teachings in the
[1:28:06] Bible
[1:28:07] until we have children it's kind of
[1:28:09] difficult I think to see some of these
[1:28:11] things to understand what it means to
[1:28:13] want to express yourself to a child what
[1:28:16] it means to want to help a child and to
[1:28:19] teach a child to train the child up in
[1:28:21] the way it should go and it won't depart
[1:28:22] from it and it doesn't matter what you
[1:28:24] train them up in that word applies
[1:28:27] so we certainly want to train our
[1:28:29] children up the right way and that is in
[1:28:31] the word in the message of the hour the
[1:28:34] present truth
[1:28:35] so it's super important in our lives but
[1:28:38] yeah it's a real blessing to have
[1:28:40] children
[1:28:41] God bless you
[1:28:43] um
[1:28:44] brother Samuel and sister Faith
[1:28:47] I just wanted to bring something before
[1:28:49] the church this morning that's really
[1:28:51] important and we're certainly thankful
[1:28:53] for it everyone has been in prayer I
[1:28:55] know it
[1:28:55] when we uh
[1:28:58] announced that we would put our name
[1:28:59] forward to be uh considered for the role
[1:29:02] of Pastor
[1:29:04] we were engaged heavily in our business
[1:29:06] and we have been ever since
[1:29:10] and uh it's been a real trial and we
[1:29:12] haven't really known what to do with it
[1:29:13] and we've just asked for prayer that the
[1:29:15] Lord would guide us lead us and guide us
[1:29:18] most businesses in in our space
[1:29:22] in in the world I think around Calgary
[1:29:25] that I'm aware of they they basically
[1:29:28] either just continue on or they uh
[1:29:31] they fold up
[1:29:33] and they go under
[1:29:34] and usually there's a lot of debt and a
[1:29:37] lot of Heartache in terms of probably
[1:29:39] the people that own the business and and
[1:29:41] customers
[1:29:42] in our case the Lord has answered prayer
[1:29:46] we we just this last week this is the
[1:29:49] very first week
[1:29:50] um
[1:29:51] that we've been operating the way we are
[1:29:53] it's just amazing for me if it sounds
[1:29:55] like I'm really confused I just have so
[1:29:59] many thoughts going through my head the
[1:30:01] Lord sold our business
[1:30:03] the business is officially sold just
[1:30:06] like
[1:30:07] when you buy a house you sign all the
[1:30:09] documents you go through all the efforts
[1:30:11] and it's not yours until you get the
[1:30:13] keys
[1:30:14] we've actually handed the keys over to
[1:30:16] someone else
[1:30:17] we are now officially employees we are
[1:30:20] no longer employers
[1:30:22] there's a transition period that we have
[1:30:24] to go through to hand the business over
[1:30:26] we want to see it succeed we trust that
[1:30:29] something good will come out of it for
[1:30:30] the man that bought it but we know that
[1:30:33] it's truly a miracle for this to happen
[1:30:36] um
[1:30:37] we could have a tremendous problem if it
[1:30:39] didn't go right it could be a tremendous
[1:30:42] debt like I said and and heartache all
[1:30:44] over the place but the Lord has really
[1:30:47] really provided and we're super thankful
[1:30:49] for everyone who has ever uttered a
[1:30:51] prayer that the Lord would help us this
[1:30:53] way truly our hearts desire is not to be
[1:30:56] business people not to be having
[1:30:58] something on the side I don't want to
[1:31:00] side hustle and try and be a preacher
[1:31:02] try and be a pastor of a church I want
[1:31:05] to be there for the congregation and and
[1:31:07] whether I'm on the phone or in person or
[1:31:10] whatever that is or maybe just in
[1:31:12] thought I want to be in the word I want
[1:31:14] to be full time in the ministry here
[1:31:17] this is my desire it's not to be working
[1:31:20] something out on the side so I can just
[1:31:22] say that I I have a little bit of jingle
[1:31:24] I'm not interested in jingle I'm
[1:31:26] interested in getting out of here my
[1:31:28] heart's desire is to see all of us come
[1:31:30] to the fullness of Jesus Christ in our
[1:31:31] lives where we can express Mark 16 in
[1:31:35] action and then have people say what is
[1:31:37] it about you man how does that work and
[1:31:40] you can say it's Mark 16 in action yeah
[1:31:42] yeah profit for our day he said that all
[1:31:44] all else is false that's the only true
[1:31:46] church that Christ will accept as his
[1:31:48] own you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:31:51] that sounds maybe far-fetched but that's
[1:31:53] the desire in my heart to see in every
[1:31:55] one of our Lives it's not a fairy tale
[1:31:58] or a pipe dream if we believe right
[1:32:02] and and like I said earlier this this
[1:32:04] testimony of Brother Gary Walker's
[1:32:06] daughter we're Believers right
[1:32:08] we believe that that's that's what the
[1:32:10] true church is Mark 16 in action we're
[1:32:12] not looking for signs and wonders
[1:32:13] they're just going to follow us that's
[1:32:15] all they do is follow
[1:32:18] so anyways company has sold
[1:32:21] we have about a six-month duration of
[1:32:24] transition
[1:32:25] and we'll just see what the Lord will do
[1:32:27] here
[1:32:28] but officially and legally we are no
[1:32:31] longer employees of that company
[1:32:33] it no longer owns US
[1:32:35] I can say this now with the Surety it's
[1:32:39] very easy very very easy
[1:32:41] for Satan to creep into a life and allow
[1:32:45] an idol to become built
[1:32:47] and and it might sound crazy to to even
[1:32:50] say this way but just if you listen for
[1:32:52] a second here I'll tell you uh having
[1:32:54] your own business is interesting because
[1:32:57] if you want to have your own business
[1:32:58] the only way that you're going to make
[1:33:00] it work is to actually feed it you have
[1:33:03] to provide for your business it becomes
[1:33:05] an entity all to itself and if you
[1:33:07] wanted to succeed you have got to give
[1:33:09] everything you've got to make it work
[1:33:11] unless you're able to purchase a
[1:33:14] business and and maybe just be an
[1:33:15] investor a private investor and a silent
[1:33:18] partner in a business and you have
[1:33:19] somebody else that's doing it and then
[1:33:20] you're just investing you're not a
[1:33:22] business owner but when you're a
[1:33:24] business owner and everything rides upon
[1:33:27] whatever decision you make
[1:33:29] it's taxing I have a healthy respect for
[1:33:32] anyone who owns their own business
[1:33:35] it's just like having a child sometimes
[1:33:37] we think we understand all about
[1:33:38] children usually it's it's the ones
[1:33:40] without children that understand the way
[1:33:42] children should be raised right but it's
[1:33:44] not the case once you have a child you
[1:33:46] begin a healthy respect for what it
[1:33:48] means to be a parent and what it means
[1:33:50] to have a fussy child and to not know
[1:33:52] how to actually Comfort it and make it
[1:33:53] quiet even in a church service
[1:33:56] there's times where that happens right
[1:33:58] but until you're there you don't really
[1:34:00] understand it so in terms of a business
[1:34:02] we are absolutely thrilled
[1:34:05] to see it go
[1:34:07] it got to be so so so large in our life
[1:34:10] not maybe in the world but in our life
[1:34:12] it was consuming us
[1:34:14] absolutely consuming us and you know
[1:34:16] what it becomes is an idol because it
[1:34:18] becomes in front of the word of God
[1:34:21] you're so tired at the end of the day
[1:34:22] you don't have time to pray you're so
[1:34:24] tired at the end in the start of the day
[1:34:25] you don't have time for devotions
[1:34:27] because you got all this stuff you got
[1:34:28] to do for your business and we know that
[1:34:30] that's what an idol is idolatry is
[1:34:31] putting anything before the word of God
[1:34:33] but you know what happens is it's soft
[1:34:35] and it's subtle that's the way Satan
[1:34:37] Works he's the most subtle of all the
[1:34:39] beasts of the field hey you'll come in
[1:34:41] and make it look glamorous and make it
[1:34:43] look good but you'll find yourself so
[1:34:45] incredibly busy sometimes
[1:34:48] that you have to serve it now this thing
[1:34:50] you created now you have to serve it
[1:34:52] and you know it might be easy to say in
[1:34:54] our case that while you you know maybe
[1:34:56] you chose that and and truly we did but
[1:34:58] you know when you go in and you tear
[1:35:00] apart a customer's house if anybody here
[1:35:01] has ever gone through renovation you'll
[1:35:03] understand what I'm talking about if you
[1:35:05] have a contractor that you put trust in
[1:35:06] to tear apart your house you kind of
[1:35:09] hope that they'll put it back together
[1:35:10] again right your whole family is
[1:35:13] depending on that action to happen so
[1:35:15] it's not just an easy case of just
[1:35:17] stopping
[1:35:19] and then moving on it's it's
[1:35:22] I could go on and on and on and I don't
[1:35:24] want to do that I want to preach the
[1:35:25] word today brothers and sisters
[1:35:27] the only reason I'm talking the way that
[1:35:28] I am is probably one of the most pivotal
[1:35:31] pivotal
[1:35:33] pivotal moments in our life in in Lisa
[1:35:36] and my lives has happened our company
[1:35:39] sale has gone and uh we're absolutely
[1:35:42] thrilled couldn't be more excited about
[1:35:45] not being involved in it not that we
[1:35:48] hate the business not that we hate the
[1:35:49] industry we believe we've been called to
[1:35:51] a position and we want to be at our post
[1:35:53] of Duty that's the desire in our hearts
[1:35:57] so anyways thank you for your prayers
[1:35:59] it's a tremendous thing there's a
[1:36:01] transition period it will probably be
[1:36:03] towards the fall before we're completely
[1:36:05] free and clear of it and uh
[1:36:08] yeah unless unless maybe the new owner
[1:36:11] he gets fed up with us and just fires us
[1:36:14] after all we are employees now of our
[1:36:17] former company so who knows what could
[1:36:19] happen I wouldn't be sad if that
[1:36:21] happened
[1:36:22] I hope he's not watching right now but I
[1:36:24] mean I'm I'm honest and sincere about
[1:36:26] that I I really want nothing more to do
[1:36:28] with it but we have obligations so we'll
[1:36:31] fill our end of the contractual
[1:36:33] obligation and that will take us into
[1:36:35] about the fall and then we'll be free so
[1:36:38] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:36:40] getting into our uh our thought this
[1:36:43] morning uh uh we're probably just going
[1:36:45] to ease into it I trust we're okay for a
[1:36:47] little bit
[1:36:48] this whole discussion about vaccines and
[1:36:51] being vaccinated and the virus and all
[1:36:53] this stuff I I just I've been looking at
[1:36:56] it a little bit myself and and
[1:36:57] contemplating it and I know that there's
[1:36:59] all manner of stuff out there that that
[1:37:01] people are captivated by some are for it
[1:37:04] some are against it some believe that
[1:37:06] covet is real and some believe that it's
[1:37:07] fake all this stuff brothers and sisters
[1:37:10] if we were to just step back and and
[1:37:12] look at it take a look at when polio
[1:37:15] happened on Earth or any one of these
[1:37:17] other diseases before the internet was
[1:37:20] around what did people do
[1:37:23] people died right
[1:37:25] people died sometimes horrific deaths
[1:37:28] sometimes people were just paralyzed
[1:37:30] sometimes all these different things all
[1:37:32] these diseases that have come on the
[1:37:33] Earth
[1:37:34] The Killers is what brother Branham said
[1:37:37] and and people
[1:37:39] they either got vaccinated
[1:37:41] or they died
[1:37:43] and until there was a vaccine on the
[1:37:45] scene they had no choice maybe some
[1:37:47] people they were able to pray their way
[1:37:49] through and they were able to see the
[1:37:51] power of God moving their lives there's
[1:37:53] no doubt in my mind that that would have
[1:37:54] happened
[1:37:57] but with polio specifically brother
[1:37:59] Branham talks about it so I'm just going
[1:38:01] to read a little quote talking about it
[1:38:04] out of 1962. and uh
[1:38:07] just talking about fear and and looking
[1:38:10] at this whole thing with with kovid
[1:38:13] what I wanted to say
[1:38:15] was I imagine
[1:38:17] if we were like them
[1:38:19] back then when they had a disease like
[1:38:21] that if we didn't have the internet and
[1:38:24] all of this nonsense
[1:38:26] of people's opinions continually being
[1:38:30] propagated before our eyes and our ears
[1:38:33] vexing our righteous Souls daily with
[1:38:36] the things that we see and we hear
[1:38:40] what would we do brothers and sisters if
[1:38:42] we knew that there was a plague in the
[1:38:43] land
[1:38:44] and people were dying because of it
[1:38:47] but then we heard because someone told
[1:38:49] us
[1:38:49] do you know that they've actually got a
[1:38:51] vaccine
[1:38:52] there's a doctor with a needle that can
[1:38:54] give you something that will keep you
[1:38:56] from dying that will save you it will
[1:38:58] help you what would we do if we weren't
[1:39:00] full of all of the garbage
[1:39:02] from the internet
[1:39:04] we would say wow how do I get one
[1:39:07] where do I need to go we'd probably look
[1:39:09] into it a little more and have a little
[1:39:10] more ambition a little more excitement
[1:39:12] for it but now Satan's Eden
[1:39:16] he's got all kinds of static out there
[1:39:18] everybody's opinion anybody that wants
[1:39:21] to have an opinion can put an opinion
[1:39:22] out there they can say it's fake news
[1:39:23] they can say it's real they can say it's
[1:39:25] fake they can say it's good for you they
[1:39:27] can say it's bad for you some people
[1:39:29] live some people die all these different
[1:39:31] opinions brothers and sisters we don't
[1:39:33] need to look at that we need to look to
[1:39:35] Christ
[1:39:36] as as children of God that needs to be
[1:39:39] our main focus
[1:39:41] but
[1:39:42] we know that we had a prophet in our day
[1:39:44] and we can refer to what the prophet
[1:39:45] said for some of this stuff it's
[1:39:47] wonderful so I'm just going to read this
[1:39:49] quote here out of key to the door 1962
[1:39:53] 1007.
[1:39:56] but the Branham says when polio struck
[1:39:57] the nation
[1:39:59] as we're all commanded to now go get
[1:40:01] this vaccine sound familiar
[1:40:04] although we're not commanded to we just
[1:40:07] presented that there's a vaccine and you
[1:40:09] can go and get it if you want to
[1:40:12] as we're all commanded now to go and get
[1:40:14] this vaccine to stamp it out
[1:40:16] when polio struck yesterday I was
[1:40:18] listening to a doctor as I was driving
[1:40:20] over the road some doctor from
[1:40:22] Louisville he said a few years ago
[1:40:24] the Great Plague hit Louisville
[1:40:27] said if men would have stood there stood
[1:40:29] where I did and saw 57 respirators at
[1:40:33] one time
[1:40:34] men women boys and girls paralyzed with
[1:40:39] a disease called polio
[1:40:42] and there was nothing could be done
[1:40:43] about it
[1:40:46] said I'd never want to see a thing like
[1:40:48] that again
[1:40:50] but science thought if there's such an
[1:40:52] evil as polio
[1:40:54] surely there's something to counteract
[1:40:56] it
[1:40:57] they fought
[1:40:59] they stood on the streets with boots
[1:41:00] those firemen put hats out and they
[1:41:03] begged and bummed they done everything
[1:41:04] trying to find a key to unlock the door
[1:41:06] to Liberty and finally one Christian
[1:41:09] gentleman by the name of Salk found a
[1:41:13] vaccine
[1:41:16] why
[1:41:18] there was evil at stake there was a
[1:41:20] killer at stake
[1:41:21] there was a key somewhere that could
[1:41:24] unlock Freedom again for man
[1:41:26] and the Salk vaccine was that the great
[1:41:30] treatment
[1:41:31] oh what the key can do the vaccine was
[1:41:33] brought forth and now is stamping out
[1:41:36] the polio with this vaccine because it
[1:41:39] was it was a never tiring and never
[1:41:42] giving up
[1:41:43] that key laid somewhere there was
[1:41:46] something
[1:41:47] would inoculate from it
[1:41:49] and they were determined to find it
[1:41:52] and if there is such an evil as polio
[1:41:56] diphtheria smallpox yellow fever tetanus
[1:42:00] lock jaw my word here coved
[1:42:05] and so forth that science these evils
[1:42:08] has been able to fight day and night
[1:42:10] till they found an inoculation from it
[1:42:12] because it's evil it's a killer
[1:42:15] how much more is there a key to
[1:42:17] Salvation for a man that's in the prison
[1:42:19] House of sin
[1:42:22] brothers and sisters
[1:42:24] we have nothing to fear
[1:42:27] many people will say well that's easy
[1:42:29] for you to say and maybe it is
[1:42:31] but remember we just said it Mark 16 in
[1:42:33] action
[1:42:34] is the true church and all else is false
[1:42:37] brothers and sisters that's what the
[1:42:38] prophet said we're just saying what the
[1:42:39] prophet said that's all we want to say
[1:42:41] we don't want to say our own words
[1:42:43] he says there's a key
[1:42:46] to that door to liberate man from it a
[1:42:48] key usually when it turns the lock and
[1:42:51] when you find the key it's got to be
[1:42:52] some treasure something that's
[1:42:55] worthwhile or you wouldn't even lock it
[1:42:57] up
[1:42:58] if it ain't worth locking up just let it
[1:43:00] go
[1:43:02] but when it's worth locking up so
[1:43:04] usually so a key usually is the note or
[1:43:08] or to something or the way to entering
[1:43:10] something that's worthwhile
[1:43:12] the key that's what it's for now it
[1:43:15] unlocks something that's worthwhile
[1:43:18] Mark 16 action brothers and sisters
[1:43:22] and we could probably just
[1:43:24] quickly turn over there just for fun
[1:43:28] Mark 16 in action
[1:43:32] I believe we had a good service on
[1:43:34] Wednesday
[1:43:35] I know for sure that Satan he just hates
[1:43:37] hearing us talk about the manifestation
[1:43:40] of the sons of God
[1:43:41] and and that's what we're doing brothers
[1:43:43] and sisters
[1:43:44] you know there's a revelation that comes
[1:43:46] out of the message of the hour it's that
[1:43:48] same Revelation that that Peter had on
[1:43:51] on that day
[1:43:52] when when Jesus said to them who who
[1:43:54] does man say that I am now who do you
[1:43:57] say that I am and he had that Revelation
[1:43:59] that's what's happening right now
[1:44:01] brothers and sisters that very same
[1:44:03] Revelation only it's not the recognition
[1:44:05] of Jesus Christ out there somewhere
[1:44:07] tangibly it's Jesus Christ in us we just
[1:44:12] read it in Colossians Christ in you the
[1:44:15] hope of glory the revelation of the word
[1:44:18] coming to life inside us but let's read
[1:44:20] in mark 16.
[1:44:23] Mark 16 uh yeah Mark 16 sorry verse 15.
[1:44:29] and he said unto them
[1:44:31] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:44:33] gospel to every creature
[1:44:35] he that believeth and is baptized I'll
[1:44:38] just throw this out there in the name of
[1:44:40] the Lord Jesus Christ according to the
[1:44:42] message of Malachi 4 right according to
[1:44:45] the prophet for our day he that
[1:44:47] believeth and is baptized he shall be
[1:44:49] saved
[1:44:51] he that believeth not shall be damned so
[1:44:53] if you believe not I've just got a
[1:44:56] trinitarian baptism and I'm just going
[1:44:57] to take that that that baptism that's
[1:45:00] actually a satanic baptism I'm just
[1:45:02] going to take that you're not going to
[1:45:04] be saved
[1:45:06] you'll wind up going through the flood
[1:45:07] just like Noah but you better hope you
[1:45:09] have a boat
[1:45:12] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:45:14] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:45:16] be damned and these signs shall follow
[1:45:18] them that what
[1:45:21] that believe not those that just say I'm
[1:45:24] good I got my church I've got my Creed
[1:45:26] my doctor and my tradition
[1:45:28] no you've got to believe it
[1:45:30] and by believing it you actually
[1:45:32] demonstrated in your life you come
[1:45:34] forward and say I want to actually do
[1:45:36] that I want to be baptized in the name
[1:45:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ and these signs
[1:45:39] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:45:41] name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:45:44] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:45:45] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:45:47] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:45:50] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:45:52] shall recover
[1:45:54] and you know there's some people that
[1:45:55] will take that and actually take it to
[1:45:57] the other end of the spectrum and say
[1:45:58] well you know what we can just have
[1:46:00] service and and who cares what the law
[1:46:02] of the land is we'll just have a
[1:46:04] communion service a communion foot
[1:46:05] Washing Service and we won't wear masks
[1:46:07] and we'll pack the church out and we'll
[1:46:09] just use one cup for communion because
[1:46:11] we believe right
[1:46:14] we don't want to tempt the Lord thy God
[1:46:16] that's what the word says don't don't
[1:46:18] tempt the Lord thy God
[1:46:21] brothers and sisters if we believe then
[1:46:22] we're going to just act like Christians
[1:46:25] we're not going to try and be fanatics
[1:46:28] God doesn't clown for nobody
[1:46:31] Mark 16 in action is the only church
[1:46:34] that he claims for his own brothers and
[1:46:36] sisters all else is false a false
[1:46:40] impersonation of the truth
[1:46:42] and it can happen so easy
[1:46:45] it will be so close that it would
[1:46:47] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:46:48] possible brothers and sisters it's not
[1:46:50] going to be some crazy uh monstrous
[1:46:53] denomination out there that's going to
[1:46:55] come marching in and and growling and
[1:46:56] snarling scaring us it's not going to be
[1:46:58] that at all
[1:46:59] it'll be someone that will be around us
[1:47:01] real close
[1:47:02] those two Vines grow up together so
[1:47:05] close that it would deceive the very
[1:47:06] elected if it were possible
[1:47:08] Satan will come as a an angel of Light
[1:47:11] but you know just like Martin we'll be
[1:47:14] able to discern him because when he does
[1:47:16] that he won't be according to the word
[1:47:19] remember that happened to Martin
[1:47:21] is documented
[1:47:23] he saw this Angel come into His study
[1:47:25] and he said worship me worship me Martin
[1:47:28] I'm the one that you've longed to see
[1:47:31] now I'm here now worship me and he said
[1:47:33] no you know there's just something not
[1:47:35] right you're wearing a crown and you
[1:47:36] know at the end of the age that's when
[1:47:38] the saints Crown you you have the crown
[1:47:40] just a little too soon he got his
[1:47:43] costume mixed up
[1:47:44] but you know because of the word that
[1:47:46] was in him he was able to discern the
[1:47:48] situation brothers and sisters same
[1:47:50] thing with us when we understand the
[1:47:52] message of the hour we're able to do it
[1:47:53] ourselves
[1:47:55] now
[1:47:57] don't be afraid of covid
[1:48:00] don't be afraid of vaccines
[1:48:02] brothers and sisters if you could drink
[1:48:04] any deadly thing do you think that you
[1:48:06] could get anything injected into you
[1:48:07] that might be deadly
[1:48:09] even if it was poison
[1:48:11] direct poison
[1:48:13] you remember the story that brother Ken
[1:48:14] told
[1:48:15] about the believer I think he was in
[1:48:17] Russia
[1:48:18] or the Ukraine
[1:48:20] the story about the man who was taken
[1:48:22] because he was a Christian and he was
[1:48:24] told that you're going to drink this cup
[1:48:26] you say that you believe Mark 16 in
[1:48:28] action you're a Christian see that cup
[1:48:30] drink it
[1:48:32] prove to me that you believe
[1:48:34] and that cup is poison he told him that
[1:48:38] they told him that's a cup of poison and
[1:48:40] we want to see you prove it now drink
[1:48:42] that cup
[1:48:44] and the man was oh my this is really
[1:48:47] putting it to the test isn't it
[1:48:49] could you imagine that
[1:48:51] being that man
[1:48:54] what did they do they took it and they
[1:48:56] gave some of it to a dog that was there
[1:48:58] what'd the dog do
[1:49:00] died
[1:49:01] put him on his back and his legs up in
[1:49:03] the air dead
[1:49:04] immediately
[1:49:06] but what did that man do
[1:49:08] that man said you know what I do believe
[1:49:10] it with all my heart
[1:49:12] so give me that cup and let me drink it
[1:49:14] and he drank it
[1:49:15] and what happened
[1:49:17] didn't those men convert based on this
[1:49:19] man's testimony of him actually being
[1:49:21] able to prove it not because he wanted
[1:49:24] to clown for God it's because they
[1:49:25] probably had a gun pointed to the head
[1:49:27] saying that you better do it or we're
[1:49:29] gonna kill you but imagine that brothers
[1:49:31] and sisters so there we are in a
[1:49:33] situation like that now we have a
[1:49:34] vaccine brother Branham talks about it
[1:49:37] over and over again if we have the
[1:49:38] opportunity to get a fix from a doctor
[1:49:40] for your situation and we just refuse
[1:49:42] the medication it's not the doctor's
[1:49:45] fault
[1:49:46] that's what brother Bradham says
[1:49:48] it's not it's not the state's fault it's
[1:49:50] not anybody's fault
[1:49:53] we have to make our own decisions and
[1:49:54] we've been given the ability to be
[1:49:56] expressed in a land of the free and we
[1:49:59] have the opportunity to make our
[1:50:00] decisions but brothers and sisters don't
[1:50:02] be afraid
[1:50:04] I have to say it this way don't be
[1:50:06] afraid what do we have to be afraid of
[1:50:07] if we believe
[1:50:10] all things are possible Right
[1:50:13] Mark 16 in action if I drink any deadly
[1:50:15] thing
[1:50:16] if I get a vaccine stuffed in my arm
[1:50:18] even if it is true poison if I'm a
[1:50:20] Believer and God doesn't want me to die
[1:50:22] again
[1:50:23] you could give me two of those shots and
[1:50:25] I won't die
[1:50:26] until he says it's time for me to die
[1:50:30] I think brother Ken said this too a man
[1:50:32] that's destined to hang
[1:50:35] can't drown
[1:50:37] right
[1:50:38] if we're destined to be raptured as the
[1:50:41] Church of the Living God a vaccine isn't
[1:50:44] going to kill us
[1:50:48] we don't need to be afraid brothers and
[1:50:50] sisters that's my point
[1:50:52] we can stand tall we can put our
[1:50:54] shoulders back and raise our chin and
[1:50:57] say blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:50:58] whether I live or whether I die I'm
[1:51:01] Christ's
[1:51:02] it doesn't matter
[1:51:05] what matters
[1:51:07] is our testimony
[1:51:09] and if we display fear
[1:51:11] and if we talk fear and if we express
[1:51:14] fear
[1:51:16] are we doing anything positive with the
[1:51:18] word of God in our lives
[1:51:20] what we're doing is showing that we
[1:51:22] don't have perfect love
[1:51:24] because if we had perfect love then
[1:51:26] there would be no fear expressed in our
[1:51:28] lives we might feel it it might be like
[1:51:31] your bucket of cold water but you know
[1:51:32] when we get a bucket of cold water
[1:51:34] splashed on us eventually we start to
[1:51:36] dry off and we start to get warm again
[1:51:38] and everything is fine sometimes fear is
[1:51:41] like that in our lives it'll come on us
[1:51:43] and we'll be afraid for a moment but
[1:51:45] then it will just disappear
[1:51:47] because we have perfect love
[1:51:50] Mark 16 in action I just can't say it
[1:51:53] enough
[1:51:55] out of our scripture reading today
[1:51:58] now we're going to get into it brothers
[1:51:59] and sisters out of our scripture reading
[1:52:01] today we know that uh
[1:52:05] uh bear with me for a second here out of
[1:52:07] the book of Colossians
[1:52:09] Paul
[1:52:11] he's talking about verse 26 and verse 27
[1:52:14] the mystery which hath been hid from the
[1:52:16] ages and from Generations that's now
[1:52:19] made manifest to his Saints now made
[1:52:22] manifest to us through the message of
[1:52:23] the hour brothers and sisters this
[1:52:25] mystery of Christ
[1:52:27] in you the hope of glory
[1:52:29] the second coming of the Lord
[1:52:31] is what we're talking about out of
[1:52:33] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:52:36] whether banham says it goes right by
[1:52:38] them and they don't recognize it till
[1:52:39] it's gone
[1:52:40] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:52:44] that God predestinated before the
[1:52:46] foundation of the Earth
[1:52:49] you know that rain it falls on the just
[1:52:51] and the unjust
[1:52:52] and and that that rain is the anointing
[1:52:55] of Malachi 4. of Revelations 10 7.
[1:53:00] the full opening of the word that was
[1:53:02] given to this world and we know what
[1:53:04] happened in 1963 if you look at the the
[1:53:07] graphs and the charts of how crime and
[1:53:10] criminal behavior and all of the
[1:53:12] Terrible Things I'm not going to list
[1:53:13] them all but if you were to look it up
[1:53:15] in a timeline and see what happened in
[1:53:17] in like 1963 when that anointing of the
[1:53:20] Lord was poured out when he poured his
[1:53:22] Spirit out upon All Flesh what happened
[1:53:25] there's all manner of evil things happen
[1:53:27] rock and roll took off the magnetic
[1:53:29] recording device came on the scene and
[1:53:32] was perverted for the use of Hollywood
[1:53:34] and and music and and the Beatles and
[1:53:37] all the different things that happen all
[1:53:39] of the the delinquencies everything just
[1:53:42] went off the charts at the same time God
[1:53:44] poured his Spirit out upon All Flesh
[1:53:49] and here we are brothers and sisters
[1:53:50] full recipients of that
[1:53:53] and today people are behaving in ways
[1:53:56] that that they think they're just going
[1:53:58] about their business and and behaving
[1:54:00] the way that they want to and and and
[1:54:01] exactly according to whatever they want
[1:54:04] to do because that's that's that's the
[1:54:05] way to see an age
[1:54:07] it's the age of people's rights
[1:54:10] and you know it just really hit me this
[1:54:12] week how how
[1:54:15] I've talked about the change of the
[1:54:16] bodies and we know all about that people
[1:54:19] wanting to change their bodies and not
[1:54:20] even realizing it why
[1:54:24] um but it just really hit me how you
[1:54:26] know in the in the word the the word to
[1:54:29] the laodicean church is that you're rich
[1:54:31] increased with goods and have need of
[1:54:33] nothing but you don't know that you're
[1:54:36] naked and poor and blind
[1:54:40] how that word is just sitting there and
[1:54:42] it I've read it so many times and we've
[1:54:44] heard it so many times but to look at it
[1:54:46] and think that how the world now is
[1:54:49] trying to get rich
[1:54:51] and trying to be naked
[1:54:54] the way the women are expressing
[1:54:55] themselves and they don't even
[1:54:56] understand it
[1:54:58] but it's fashionable it's Hollywood it's
[1:55:01] it's the way the world is I'm not going
[1:55:03] to go too far down that road don't don't
[1:55:04] get uneasy I'm not trying to to be that
[1:55:06] way but just to think about it how how
[1:55:09] amazing it is to see how the word it
[1:55:11] just affects all of humankind the entire
[1:55:15] world and and they don't even realize
[1:55:17] why
[1:55:18] except for those people who are the
[1:55:20] predestinated seed they can realize that
[1:55:23] the word of God comes on the world comes
[1:55:25] across the world for a purpose and
[1:55:27] that's to make make the seed that's in
[1:55:30] people come to manifest whether it's a
[1:55:33] seed of Honor or whether it's a seed of
[1:55:35] Dishonor everyone will Express what kind
[1:55:38] of seed is in them
[1:55:40] and people can't help it
[1:55:42] you can't prevent that from happening
[1:55:45] some people were made as a vessel of
[1:55:47] honor and some people were made
[1:55:49] as a vessel Of Dishonor some people made
[1:55:51] to be saved some people made for
[1:55:53] Destruction
[1:55:54] and it's terrible to even speak that but
[1:55:57] it's the word
[1:55:58] I'm just speaking what the word says
[1:56:01] you know
[1:56:02] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:56:06] it's pretty alarming when you look at it
[1:56:09] that way
[1:56:10] and we know
[1:56:11] in case somebody is watching or looking
[1:56:14] at this later on we're not talking about
[1:56:16] this from an elite perspective
[1:56:19] because that's an antichrist spirit
[1:56:22] when someone would say I'm saved look at
[1:56:25] me thank you Lord that I'm not like all
[1:56:27] the rest of them people that I see in
[1:56:29] the denominational world no
[1:56:31] no that's not that is not the heart of a
[1:56:36] True Believer and that is not the heart
[1:56:38] of Christ because his heart is that all
[1:56:40] would come to repentance
[1:56:42] that everyone would be saved
[1:56:45] but you know there's there's people that
[1:56:47] would take that and say well you know
[1:56:49] when you talk that way about people
[1:56:50] being fit for Destruction that you're
[1:56:52] you're making yourself something no no
[1:56:54] no no no it's just what the word makes
[1:56:56] people and you know if you get that
[1:56:59] revelation
[1:57:00] that God has saved you
[1:57:02] that it truly has been a new birth in
[1:57:04] your life
[1:57:06] to understand that you've been born not
[1:57:08] of the will of the flesh not of the will
[1:57:10] of man
[1:57:12] but I've been born by the will of God
[1:57:13] that's talking about the New Birth that
[1:57:16] scripture in Saint John
[1:57:18] Christ making himself
[1:57:21] revealed to the individual personally
[1:57:23] Christ showing himself that he is alive
[1:57:26] and well when that Revelation hits the
[1:57:28] heart of a True Believer it causes
[1:57:31] something to happen we begin to sigh and
[1:57:33] we begin to cry for the Abominations
[1:57:35] that are in the land when we look around
[1:57:37] us and we see all of the different
[1:57:39] things that go on in the world no longer
[1:57:42] can we watch a Hollywood movie that will
[1:57:44] just promote adultery and fornication or
[1:57:47] listen to music that would promote
[1:57:49] either one of those things because they
[1:57:51] both promote the same thing rebellion
[1:57:54] and and and dishonor everything contrary
[1:57:57] to the word it's Antichrist but
[1:57:59] something in US Rises up and says I just
[1:58:01] can't do it anymore
[1:58:04] it doesn't give us the ability to say oh
[1:58:06] I judge those people look at those
[1:58:07] people they're horrible and I'm great no
[1:58:09] way no if that's happening in our lives
[1:58:12] brothers and sisters we need to take a
[1:58:13] step back and we need to check up our
[1:58:15] experience because our experience ain't
[1:58:17] right
[1:58:17] it's not
[1:58:19] we look at the world and we can see
[1:58:20] what's going on in the world but we
[1:58:22] don't judge people
[1:58:24] the word judges people and God judges
[1:58:26] people we want to try and attract every
[1:58:29] single person brother Branham says that
[1:58:30] we wouldn't wish that on our worst enemy
[1:58:32] that they would be lost we want to take
[1:58:34] as many people with us as we can and how
[1:58:37] does that happen it happens by the word
[1:58:39] by the word working mightily In You by
[1:58:42] the word working mightily in me where we
[1:58:44] just live our lives and people look at
[1:58:46] us and they say What Makes You Different
[1:58:47] what is it about you something about you
[1:58:50] I just don't understand it
[1:58:52] and sometimes you can say yeah you know
[1:58:54] I just can't understand it either but I
[1:58:56] believe it
[1:58:58] it's the word
[1:58:59] how do you explain Jesus Christ
[1:59:02] you just you just live it
[1:59:04] it's him living out through US brother
[1:59:06] Bradham says it goes right by them and
[1:59:08] they don't recognize it till it's gone
[1:59:10] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:59:12] that God predestinated before the
[1:59:14] foundation of the Earth the same thing
[1:59:16] come through the days of Noah the same
[1:59:18] thing come through the days of Moses
[1:59:20] Days of Elijah days of the prophets days
[1:59:23] of Jesus on down through and to this
[1:59:26] very hour
[1:59:28] 50 years ago
[1:59:30] but it's no different today brothers and
[1:59:31] sisters the pagnated person with the
[1:59:34] seed of God the word in their
[1:59:37] manifesting itself
[1:59:41] and sometimes we say yeah I'm a
[1:59:43] Christian
[1:59:45] because that word just lives out through
[1:59:47] us right
[1:59:49] we don't we don't have to put a flag on
[1:59:52] our on our car and and bumper stickers
[1:59:54] and and go and tell everyone that I'm a
[1:59:57] Christian maybe sometimes we'll feel led
[1:59:59] to do that maybe we'll get a drum and a
[2:00:01] symbol and go on March up and down the
[2:00:03] street and and sing hymns so that people
[2:00:05] will see that there's a Christian Living
[2:00:06] there but you know what speaks louder
[2:00:08] than that is actually
[2:00:11] living your life brother Branham says
[2:00:13] that sometimes you'll even have to talk
[2:00:15] a life lived is the loudest sermon
[2:00:17] preached
[2:00:19] we don't have to go and be a fanatic to
[2:00:21] try and show people that we believe
[2:00:22] Jesus Christ what we need to do is
[2:00:25] actually cast out all fear
[2:00:28] with perfect love in our lives and
[2:00:31] express perfect love to this world
[2:00:34] to the people that nobody else wants to
[2:00:36] talk to in this world the people who are
[2:00:38] the most difficult people to get along
[2:00:40] with to be able to say well you know
[2:00:42] maybe someone just hasn't expressed love
[2:00:44] to them maybe they just never met Jesus
[2:00:47] Christ before in their lives
[2:00:52] on down through and to this very hour
[2:00:55] the pregnated person with the seed of
[2:00:58] God
[2:00:59] the word in there manifesting itself so
[2:01:02] surrender to the will of God that the
[2:01:05] word and the word alone
[2:01:07] manifests itself to this person's a
[2:01:11] prisoner
[2:01:13] to an individual
[2:01:16] are you a prisoner to an individual
[2:01:20] might sound weird but it's true
[2:01:23] we become prisoners to Christ
[2:01:26] when we believe
[2:01:28] maybe turn over to the Book of Luke
[2:01:30] with me this morning
[2:01:32] Luke chapter one it's one page over
[2:01:35] from Mark 16 in action
[2:01:40] in the Book of Luke
[2:01:45] I just believe it with all my heart that
[2:01:47] Satan absolutely hates
[2:01:50] what we're talking about today brothers
[2:01:51] and sisters
[2:01:54] we'll go back and read this quote again
[2:01:55] after we read this scripture
[2:01:57] Luke chapter 1 verse 26.
[2:02:01] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[2:02:04] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[2:02:07] named Nazareth
[2:02:08] to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name
[2:02:11] was Joseph of the House of David
[2:02:14] and the virgin's name was Mary
[2:02:16] and the angel came in unto her and said
[2:02:19] hail
[2:02:20] thou that art highly favored the Lord is
[2:02:24] with thee blessed art thou among women
[2:02:27] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[2:02:29] his saying and cast in her mind what
[2:02:31] manner of salutation this should be
[2:02:34] an angel said unto her
[2:02:37] fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor
[2:02:40] with God and behold Thou shalt conceive
[2:02:44] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[2:02:46] shall call his name Jesus
[2:02:49] he shall be great and he shall be called
[2:02:51] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[2:02:54] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[2:02:57] father David and he shall reign over the
[2:03:00] house of Jacob forever in the kingdom
[2:03:02] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[2:03:05] then said Mary unto the angel
[2:03:08] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[2:03:10] man
[2:03:11] and the angel answered and said unto her
[2:03:14] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[2:03:17] the power of the highest shall
[2:03:19] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[2:03:22] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[2:03:26] be called the son of God
[2:03:28] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath
[2:03:31] also conceived a son in her old age and
[2:03:34] this is the sixth month with her who is
[2:03:36] called Barren for with God nothing shall
[2:03:40] be impossible
[2:03:42] and Mary said
[2:03:44] behold the handmaid of the Lord be it
[2:03:46] unto me according to Thy word and the
[2:03:47] angel departed from her
[2:03:49] we know that this is the beginning of
[2:03:51] the Christmas message
[2:03:53] but you know brothers and sisters
[2:03:55] I want to I want to beg to differ on
[2:03:58] that
[2:04:00] I want to take this and I want to make
[2:04:02] it the present tense scripture this is
[2:04:05] about us in our day
[2:04:07] you know that every scripture has a
[2:04:08] compound meaning
[2:04:09] and every scripture has a compound
[2:04:11] Revelation brother Branham said that
[2:04:14] what I want to do is take this out of
[2:04:15] history and take it from being Santa
[2:04:18] Claus and and the manger and Mary and
[2:04:21] all the stuff Associated to Christmas
[2:04:22] and let's fast forward and let's go back
[2:04:25] to the scripture that we just read now
[2:04:26] keep that keep that page open right
[2:04:28] there reading all of that that we just
[2:04:30] read and and let's let's read Colossians
[2:04:33] again verse 26 and 27.
[2:04:39] keeping that one open in in Luke
[2:04:42] let's go read Colossians chapter 1 verse
[2:04:45] 26
[2:04:47] and 27. even the mystery which hath been
[2:04:50] hid from the ages and from Generations
[2:04:54] but is now made manifest to his Saints
[2:04:58] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[2:05:01] to whom God would make known what is the
[2:05:03] riches of the glory of this mystery
[2:05:05] among the Gentiles
[2:05:07] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:05:11] how can that possibly be brothers and
[2:05:13] sisters
[2:05:15] I want to tell you
[2:05:17] and I knew that you knew that
[2:05:20] but you know what
[2:05:21] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:05:23] today and forever and he's not going to
[2:05:25] do anything any different than he ever
[2:05:27] has
[2:05:28] the only thing different that he'll do
[2:05:30] what he already has done only a couple
[2:05:32] times in the Bible so far is he's going
[2:05:34] to Rapture a gentile church that's
[2:05:37] something that's not real popular that
[2:05:39] hasn't happened a lot but it's coming
[2:05:41] brothers and sisters and that's the last
[2:05:43] promise for the Gentile Church
[2:05:46] but how could we ever ever
[2:05:48] be able to be like Mary
[2:05:52] it's in verse 38. that's the key to it
[2:05:54] just just say say unto the Lord behold
[2:05:57] the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[2:05:59] according to Thy Word how can we do that
[2:06:01] brothers and sisters by saying you know
[2:06:03] what
[2:06:05] God sends an angel
[2:06:08] you know what that that verse is in in
[2:06:10] Revelation chapter 10.
[2:06:13] behold in the days of the voice of the
[2:06:16] seventh
[2:06:18] Angels mystery Angels the days of the
[2:06:21] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[2:06:24] begin to sound
[2:06:26] even the mystery of Christ shall be
[2:06:29] revealed what is the mystery of Christ
[2:06:30] we just read it
[2:06:32] the mystery of Christ
[2:06:34] in you
[2:06:35] the hope of glory
[2:06:38] so this scripture here that we just read
[2:06:39] in Luke
[2:06:42] yes it's about Mary
[2:06:44] and yes it's about Jesus being
[2:06:47] introduced to the world the Lamb of God
[2:06:49] the the one that taketh away all of the
[2:06:52] sin the atonement for all of us but
[2:06:55] brothers and sisters let's look at it a
[2:06:57] little bit closer and think you know
[2:06:58] what when the angel came unto her and
[2:07:00] said hail thou that are highly favored
[2:07:02] the the Lord is with thee blessed art
[2:07:05] thou among women remember the church is
[2:07:08] referred to as woman as female
[2:07:13] so I say to you this morning blessed art
[2:07:16] you thou highly favored the Lord looks
[2:07:20] at you with high favor to be able to
[2:07:23] hear the salutation of the Angel of the
[2:07:26] Lord of Malachi 4. to hear the message
[2:07:29] of the hour brothers and sisters it's no
[2:07:31] different than it was for Mary
[2:07:33] thou highly favored
[2:07:36] but when she saw him she was troubled at
[2:07:39] his saying many of us when we hear about
[2:07:40] the message of the hour at first it's
[2:07:42] troubling how could it be the same thing
[2:07:45] how could it be that an angel has come
[2:07:47] and said to me thou highly favored of
[2:07:50] God
[2:07:51] blessed art thou
[2:07:54] but if we think about it
[2:07:56] it's no different than Mary right
[2:07:59] remember what brother Branham said in
[2:08:01] invisible Union
[2:08:03] you are the sinless Spotless virtuous
[2:08:06] bride of Jesus Christ
[2:08:08] a virgin
[2:08:10] a spouse to one man so we look at
[2:08:13] ourselves and we say wow me
[2:08:16] that's weird why would you say that
[2:08:17] brother Barry look look at your life
[2:08:21] because typically that's probably what
[2:08:22] people will do is say look at your life
[2:08:23] I I would say that I'm you know
[2:08:28] I'm the chiefest of sinners
[2:08:30] I come from not a great area I come from
[2:08:33] probably not a great upbringing I
[2:08:35] probably don't have a great pedigree but
[2:08:37] you know what that's all irrelevant
[2:08:39] because we read it earlier
[2:08:41] in the quote that I'm going to go back
[2:08:43] and read again this just gets me excited
[2:08:45] because I know on my own I have nothing
[2:08:48] I am nothing and I never will be
[2:08:52] but if I could take the word for my day
[2:08:53] the prophet says it goes right by them
[2:08:56] and they don't recognize it till it's
[2:08:58] gone it only picks up the predestinated
[2:09:01] seed that God predestinated before the
[2:09:04] foundation of the Earth the same thing
[2:09:06] through the days of Noah same thing
[2:09:07] through the days of Moses Elijah the
[2:09:10] prophets and even in Jesus day on down
[2:09:12] to this very hour the pregnated person
[2:09:15] with the seed of God which is the word
[2:09:17] the seed of God the word in there
[2:09:20] manifesting itself so surrendered to the
[2:09:23] will of God that the word and the word
[2:09:25] alone manifests itself Mark 16 in action
[2:09:28] manifests itself to this person's a
[2:09:31] prisoner an individual the people in
[2:09:34] this world they look at us and they say
[2:09:35] what makes you different
[2:09:38] because I believe
[2:09:40] because I understood that an angel came
[2:09:43] to a virgin
[2:09:45] espoused but only this time not to a man
[2:09:48] not to some worldly denomination
[2:09:52] a virgin espoused to Christ
[2:09:55] but she just didn't recognize it she had
[2:09:57] a little bit of spiritual amnesia
[2:10:00] and you know she was troubled in her
[2:10:02] mind Mary was troubled in her mind
[2:10:05] at the saying how could how could this
[2:10:07] possibly be how could the message of the
[2:10:08] hour how could the revelations 10 7
[2:10:11] actually be how how could this be the
[2:10:13] the angel of of Malachi 4. how could
[2:10:15] this be
[2:10:17] it's troubling
[2:10:18] until he he reveals himself to you but
[2:10:21] you know when you get baptized in the
[2:10:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:10:24] mission of your sins
[2:10:26] according to the scripture according to
[2:10:27] what the prophet brought the angel
[2:10:29] brought to us when we actually do that
[2:10:32] he's a dissolver of all doubts
[2:10:34] he actually opens our eyes of
[2:10:36] understanding that we can see
[2:10:39] what is the riches of his glory in our
[2:10:41] lives
[2:10:43] and there comes a point
[2:10:46] where we hear the angel say good evening
[2:10:49] friends
[2:10:51] and when we listen to that something
[2:10:53] inside of our hearts something inside of
[2:10:56] our souls just like Mary
[2:10:59] when we hear that voice we hear the
[2:11:01] angel saying to our souls fear not Mary
[2:11:04] just take out Mary's name for a little
[2:11:06] while and read this scripture a little
[2:11:08] bit this week just just just try and
[2:11:10] read it and put your name in there make
[2:11:12] it your name make it personal to you and
[2:11:15] say fear not Mary for thou Hast found
[2:11:18] favor with God brothers and sisters if
[2:11:20] you have the ability to even hear the
[2:11:22] message of the hour whether you believe
[2:11:24] it or not you have found favor with God
[2:11:27] whether you can say I believe in in the
[2:11:30] Elijah Ministry I believe that there's
[2:11:32] five comings of Elijah I believe that
[2:11:33] brother Bradham was a a prophet of God
[2:11:35] or not whether you believe it or not
[2:11:37] you're highly favored to be able to hear
[2:11:40] the words that God sent a prophet and
[2:11:42] whether you do something with it or not
[2:11:44] is up to you
[2:11:45] it depends on what that seed is that's
[2:11:47] inside of you but then brothers and
[2:11:49] sisters oh my this is where I start to
[2:11:51] get excited think about it even if you
[2:11:53] hear it and you don't have the ability
[2:11:54] to receive it you're highly favored but
[2:11:56] what about those who are that
[2:11:58] predestinated seed from before the
[2:11:59] foundation of the world that have been
[2:12:01] predestinated to receive that word in
[2:12:04] their day oh my
[2:12:06] to me that is exciting
[2:12:08] and you know if this doesn't get us
[2:12:09] excited I don't know what does what on
[2:12:11] this world gets us excited you know
[2:12:13] because there comes a point where we we
[2:12:15] realize that that the angel is saying to
[2:12:18] us behold
[2:12:20] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[2:12:24] we know that this is talking about Mary
[2:12:25] physically but today we're talking about
[2:12:28] you spiritually me spiritually there
[2:12:31] comes a point where we realize what this
[2:12:33] Angel is trying to tell us that when we
[2:12:35] receive the message of the hour when we
[2:12:37] truly get baptized in the name of the
[2:12:39] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:12:40] sin so that we might receive the baptism
[2:12:42] of the holy spirit that which is
[2:12:45] conceived in our womb it's not just a
[2:12:49] church Creed it's not just a
[2:12:51] denomination it's not just an
[2:12:53] association it's not just a good
[2:12:55] Fellowship what it is brothers and
[2:12:58] sisters you will bring forth the son
[2:13:00] inside of you and you shall call his
[2:13:02] name what
[2:13:04] Jesus
[2:13:06] the word is only going to bring forth
[2:13:08] one thing in our lives brothers and
[2:13:10] sisters it's not going to bring us into
[2:13:11] a church it's not going to bring us into
[2:13:13] an association the prophet didn't come
[2:13:15] here to encourage us to get together and
[2:13:18] be clicky and just be a fine group of
[2:13:20] people he encouraged us to get into the
[2:13:22] word to get into Christ to follow his
[2:13:25] instructions so that when we receive the
[2:13:27] word spiritually into our womb something
[2:13:29] comes forth in our lives we have a new
[2:13:32] birth and when we have a new birth it's
[2:13:34] not someone that we we know
[2:13:36] it's not someone that we would like to
[2:13:38] be
[2:13:40] it's not part of our old self
[2:13:42] it's Jesus
[2:13:45] and Jesus alone it's Jesus that takes
[2:13:48] his his life starts to come forth inside
[2:13:51] of our womb
[2:13:52] and you know
[2:13:54] brother Branham talks about it that
[2:13:55] there's only one animal in the Kingdom
[2:13:58] that when they're pregnant their womb is
[2:14:00] sealed and that's a human
[2:14:03] brothers and sisters if you take this
[2:14:05] word into your soul
[2:14:07] and you become pregnant with this word
[2:14:10] you're sealed out
[2:14:12] all the rest of it is sealed out there's
[2:14:13] no room nobody else can come along and
[2:14:15] mess up your experience
[2:14:17] not even Satan
[2:14:19] we've talked about it you can get so far
[2:14:21] into the word so far into the word that
[2:14:23] Satan won't even be able to find you
[2:14:26] we can get so close to God that Satan
[2:14:28] won't even know what to do with us all
[2:14:30] of these different things that we know
[2:14:31] is available but brothers and sisters I
[2:14:34] just felt so impressed with this
[2:14:36] scripture from Luke it's not about
[2:14:38] Christmas
[2:14:40] Satan wants it to be about Christmas
[2:14:42] and about the the Virgin Mary and all
[2:14:45] the stuff that goes along with that no
[2:14:47] this is about you this is about you
[2:14:49] having a New Birth
[2:14:50] about that new birth coming and taking
[2:14:53] taking hold in your lives
[2:14:56] and you know he goes and talks to to
[2:14:58] Mary in verse 32 and 33 and says that he
[2:15:01] shall be great be called the son of the
[2:15:02] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[2:15:05] him the Throne of his father David and
[2:15:07] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[2:15:09] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[2:15:11] be no end he's describing Jesus the the
[2:15:14] person and how he will be exalted so
[2:15:17] high oh that he'll have to look down to
[2:15:19] be able to see heaven
[2:15:21] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[2:15:24] this be seeing I know not a man how
[2:15:25] could this possibly be that I would be
[2:15:27] able to give birth how could I ever have
[2:15:30] a new birth in my life to Jesus Christ
[2:15:32] how could that ever be
[2:15:35] isn't it amazing to look at this the
[2:15:37] Virgin birth
[2:15:40] and the angel answered and said unto her
[2:15:43] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee get
[2:15:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:15:47] Christ for their mission of sin and see
[2:15:49] what happens there is a promise that
[2:15:51] will come unto you
[2:15:52] you know he doesn't say that the church
[2:15:56] will overshadow you
[2:15:58] go up and see the priests
[2:16:00] and the Levites and they'll do an
[2:16:01] excellent sacrifice for you and and they
[2:16:04] shall overshadow you the power that's
[2:16:06] expressed through them shall overshadow
[2:16:07] you
[2:16:08] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you this
[2:16:11] was before the Holy Ghost was given
[2:16:12] right
[2:16:13] Holy Ghost wasn't even given
[2:16:17] the angel answered and said unto her the
[2:16:19] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee oh my I
[2:16:22] just love this part this is the best
[2:16:23] part brothers and sisters because it's
[2:16:24] true it happens to us today he's the
[2:16:27] same yesterday today and forever Mark 16
[2:16:29] in action brothers and sisters the power
[2:16:32] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[2:16:35] therefore also that Holy thing which
[2:16:38] shall be born of thee shall be called
[2:16:40] the son of God
[2:16:43] now go back to Colossians and read that
[2:16:45] even the mystery
[2:16:47] of Christ in you
[2:16:51] the hope of glory brothers and sisters
[2:16:53] not a fairy tale
[2:16:55] not sometime in the future not some
[2:16:57] other age not the Millennium right now
[2:17:00] right here today
[2:17:03] you know what Satan hates this preaching
[2:17:06] he hates it and you know I'm saying it
[2:17:08] because I know it but the prophet said
[2:17:11] it not just me this ain't just Barry
[2:17:13] saying this
[2:17:15] I just got to read this again I just
[2:17:16] love it so good
[2:17:19] I I hope it does this for someone else
[2:17:21] to maybe I'm just a fanatic goodness it
[2:17:25] says it goes by them it goes right by
[2:17:26] them and they don't recognize it till
[2:17:28] it's gone it only picks up the
[2:17:29] predestinated seed that God
[2:17:31] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:17:32] the earth same thing through the days of
[2:17:34] Noah come through the days of Moses Days
[2:17:37] of Elijah days of the prophets days of
[2:17:39] Jesus on down and to and through this
[2:17:41] very hour the pregnant person with the
[2:17:44] seed of God what is the seed of God he
[2:17:46] says it right here the word in there
[2:17:48] manifesting itself so surrender to the
[2:17:51] will of God that the word and the word
[2:17:53] alone manifest itself to this person's a
[2:17:56] prisoner
[2:17:57] an individual
[2:17:59] we become a person who is a prisoner
[2:18:03] and to an individual I just love how he
[2:18:05] says that a person who is a prisoner to
[2:18:08] an individual you're not a prisoner to a
[2:18:10] church not a prisoner to an association
[2:18:12] not a prisoner to some place that's
[2:18:15] going to give you a fellowship card that
[2:18:16] if you believe and act and and do the
[2:18:19] way that they say that you should that
[2:18:20] you can have that fine card and all of
[2:18:23] the benefits that go along with that
[2:18:24] Association but as soon as you step out
[2:18:26] of line from what they believe get lost
[2:18:27] no
[2:18:29] impossible
[2:18:31] because they didn't write your name in
[2:18:33] heaven
[2:18:34] and they can't take it out of there
[2:18:38] it's awesome
[2:18:39] out of Christ the mystery butter Branham
[2:18:41] says not say my church done my church
[2:18:43] has done nothing to do with it he says
[2:18:45] it's an individual one person
[2:18:49] individual one person and he goes on to
[2:18:52] say that all hell is against this
[2:18:54] teaching
[2:18:56] all hell is against us coming to the
[2:18:59] manifestation of sons of God
[2:19:02] all hell is against us coming to the
[2:19:05] place where we recognize who we are
[2:19:06] brothers and sisters
[2:19:08] that's why we're preaching this today
[2:19:10] that's why we're preaching this this way
[2:19:12] because the only thing that's going to
[2:19:14] pregnate us is the word
[2:19:17] that's the only thing that's going to
[2:19:19] change our bodies is the word
[2:19:22] not a church not an organization not a
[2:19:24] program not not more organization none
[2:19:27] of that the only thing that's going to
[2:19:29] do it is the word that's all
[2:19:34] and Mary said unto the angel verse 34
[2:19:37] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[2:19:39] man and the angel answered and said unto
[2:19:41] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[2:19:43] and the power of the highest shall
[2:19:46] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[2:19:51] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[2:19:53] be called the son of God
[2:19:57] I believe many times we can talk about
[2:19:59] the new birth and and when there's a new
[2:20:01] birth I'll just use me for an example I
[2:20:03] went from being completely in the world
[2:20:05] to being completely saved and and and
[2:20:07] and and and I'm still very I'm not Barry
[2:20:11] you might see me in my flesh but you
[2:20:13] don't see who I am you don't see the
[2:20:16] Lord Jesus Christ in the inside of the
[2:20:18] inside because brothers and sisters if
[2:20:20] I've got the Holy Ghost that's what's in
[2:20:22] there that teeny little spot that he
[2:20:24] created inside the heart of a man for
[2:20:26] the Holy Spirit that's me
[2:20:29] my representation isn't this flesh it's
[2:20:32] not my my Consciousness it's not my
[2:20:34] spirit it's not what you see here on
[2:20:36] Earth my representation is in heaven
[2:20:39] I've got a theophany over there waiting
[2:20:41] for me and the more that we talk like
[2:20:42] this and and have decent Services the
[2:20:45] more we hear from our theophany bodies
[2:20:49] every one of us has a theophany body
[2:20:51] over there if we're a Believer and you
[2:20:54] know what that body cries out to us and
[2:20:56] and we know that
[2:20:58] but it's just worth talking about
[2:20:59] there's nothing else really worth
[2:21:01] talking about we can talk about sports
[2:21:03] and weather and all the different news
[2:21:05] things but what relevance does it have
[2:21:07] to the true believers
[2:21:11] you know the power of the highest it
[2:21:13] shall overshadow thee and and and and
[2:21:15] you'll have a new birth
[2:21:17] there'll be something that comes forward
[2:21:18] in your life you don't remain the same
[2:21:21] person that you were
[2:21:23] remember brother Branham says it that a
[2:21:25] birth doesn't matter what it is a birth
[2:21:28] is always messy
[2:21:31] why is it because you recognize how lost
[2:21:34] you really are when you have a new birth
[2:21:36] you recognize that your soul is actually
[2:21:40] hanging over Hell by a chain that's just
[2:21:43] about to break
[2:21:44] and once you recognize that brothers and
[2:21:46] sisters then you can sing Grace Grace
[2:21:49] marvelous Grace
[2:21:51] that Grace that was set aside for me the
[2:21:54] the thing the only thing that will ever
[2:21:56] save me is that Grace that he gave unto
[2:21:58] us
[2:22:00] and it gives us the ability we'll just
[2:22:02] jump down to verse 38 it gives us the
[2:22:04] ability the heart of a True Believer
[2:22:06] when when that light flashes when that
[2:22:09] word comes forward when that angel
[2:22:11] speaks to us and and we hear something
[2:22:13] is different about that when when that
[2:22:15] happens in our lives brothers and
[2:22:17] sisters there's something that rises up
[2:22:18] because it's that predestinated seed it
[2:22:21] can't not answer it has to answer just
[2:22:24] like every seed has to answer to the
[2:22:26] anointing that gets poured out upon All
[2:22:28] Flesh and not every seed is a seed of
[2:22:30] God but those seeds of God those ones
[2:22:33] who actually are predestined it to hear
[2:22:35] this word they're just like Mary and
[2:22:37] they say behold the handmaid of the Lord
[2:22:39] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[2:22:43] and what happens then the angel departed
[2:22:45] from her
[2:22:46] that's all we need to do brothers and
[2:22:48] sisters is be able to say be it unto me
[2:22:49] according to Thy Word
[2:22:51] the message of Malachi 4 that angel the
[2:22:54] seventh angel messenger the final
[2:22:56] message to the final age on Earth and
[2:23:00] here we are brothers and sisters my
[2:23:02] goodness to think that we have the
[2:23:04] ability not only to just hear it
[2:23:07] but to receive it and and to receive it
[2:23:10] and then to actually become it
[2:23:12] it's not he how many of us would ever
[2:23:14] want to become Jesus Christ in our lives
[2:23:17] set out I'm born and and I come into
[2:23:19] this world and that's my ambition is to
[2:23:21] become Jesus Christ it's contrary to
[2:23:23] this flesh
[2:23:26] remember in in verse 8
[2:23:28] of Revelations 10.
[2:23:31] there was that little book and John was
[2:23:33] instructed to take it and eat it up
[2:23:37] and that it would be bitter in thy belly
[2:23:40] but sweet is honey in thy mouth
[2:23:43] so sweet it's so sweet to talk about the
[2:23:46] things of the Lord but to go on let that
[2:23:48] word come right down on the inside and
[2:23:50] begin to pregnate us just like we talked
[2:23:52] about this morning having that word hit
[2:23:54] that predestinated seed in our lives
[2:23:57] it's bitter and the reason why is
[2:23:59] because this flesh will never see God
[2:24:01] this flesh has got to perish
[2:24:04] but it's our spirit that actually takes
[2:24:06] a hold of it and takes it right down
[2:24:08] into our soul our flesh takes us to
[2:24:11] church our spirit receives the word but
[2:24:13] it's our soul that actually takes root
[2:24:16] in and and this word comes to pass in
[2:24:19] our lives
[2:24:20] and Mary said behold
[2:24:22] the handmaid of the lord we just need to
[2:24:24] say it be it unto me according to Thy
[2:24:26] word just just let your word come to
[2:24:28] pass in my life I might not understand
[2:24:29] it completely remember Hattie writes she
[2:24:31] probably didn't understand it either
[2:24:33] when brother Brown was talking about the
[2:24:34] squirrels and telling the stories around
[2:24:36] the table but she said there's something
[2:24:38] about that she just couldn't lie because
[2:24:40] that thing inside of her that seed that
[2:24:42] was within her it just said that's
[2:24:44] nothing but the truth
[2:24:46] and when a True Believer comes across
[2:24:48] this word and they hear it they say the
[2:24:49] same thing and you know what happens
[2:24:50] when they say the same thing when that's
[2:24:52] nothing but the truth that means they're
[2:24:53] accepting that word for themselves and
[2:24:56] what they're doing is they're not just
[2:24:57] taking it in the Physical Realm they're
[2:24:59] not just taking it in the spirit realm
[2:25:00] but they're taking it into the soul
[2:25:02] realm that word is nothing but the truth
[2:25:04] and when that happens brothers and
[2:25:05] sisters the power of the highest will
[2:25:07] overshadow you and there will be a new
[2:25:09] birth
[2:25:09] there will be a new birth but it's not a
[2:25:12] man that does it for you it's not a
[2:25:13] church that does it for you it's the
[2:25:15] Lord Jesus Christ that does it for you
[2:25:17] in word form
[2:25:20] brother Branham says that it's an
[2:25:22] individual one person all hell is
[2:25:24] against this teaching all hell is
[2:25:27] against this truth but it's truth Jesus
[2:25:30] never said now Peter you and John and
[2:25:32] all the rest of the people you've got
[2:25:34] the Revelation now the whole church is
[2:25:37] saved no it was to him personally
[2:25:40] it's a personal experience the new birth
[2:25:42] is personal
[2:25:44] it can be an association it can't be a
[2:25:46] tradition it can't be our parents it
[2:25:49] can't be our brother our sister our aunt
[2:25:51] and uncle grandparents
[2:25:53] nope it's got to be a new birth to the
[2:25:55] individual
[2:25:57] Christ revealed personally he says I say
[2:26:01] unto thee not unto them to thee Thou Art
[2:26:04] Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my
[2:26:06] church and the word Peter means a stone
[2:26:09] stone means the confessed one or the
[2:26:12] separated one Upon A Certain Stone Upon
[2:26:14] A Certain thing see a called out a
[2:26:16] church called out upon this Stone upon
[2:26:19] this revelation
[2:26:21] Flesh and Blood never revealed it to you
[2:26:23] but upon this Revelations called out
[2:26:26] group I'll build my church in them
[2:26:29] love how he says that
[2:26:31] not in the church
[2:26:33] this is the prophet saying it I'll build
[2:26:35] my church in them
[2:26:39] excuse me and all the gates of hell
[2:26:42] will never be able to withstand it
[2:26:44] once you've had that experience
[2:26:47] you've taken that word into your womb
[2:26:49] you say maybe I don't understand it
[2:26:51] completely
[2:26:52] but just be it unto me Lord according to
[2:26:54] Thy word that the seventh angel
[2:26:57] messenger brought that angel when you
[2:26:58] hear that voice and he begins to speak
[2:27:01] the word and you begin to not
[2:27:04] necessarily understand it but something
[2:27:05] just Rises up and says man there's
[2:27:09] something about that and the more you
[2:27:11] feed on it the more you receive it into
[2:27:13] you that's why
[2:27:15] Faith cometh by hearing
[2:27:17] and hearing what the word of God that's
[2:27:20] why when we do that brothers and sisters
[2:27:22] it becomes a new birth to us we become a
[2:27:25] new creature in Christ Jesus we're not
[2:27:27] the same as we were or the same that we
[2:27:30] were going to be
[2:27:32] but what happens
[2:27:34] is that no one will ever be able to take
[2:27:37] it away from you
[2:27:39] if you have a traditional experience
[2:27:42] someone somewhere along the way will
[2:27:45] take it away from you
[2:27:46] if you've got a church experience
[2:27:48] someone somewhere along the way will
[2:27:51] take it from you and you wonder how I'll
[2:27:53] tell you how
[2:27:54] someone is going to preach something
[2:27:56] that's going to step on your toes
[2:27:58] and you're going to get offended and
[2:27:59] you're going to leave
[2:28:02] if it's if it's
[2:28:04] an association
[2:28:06] someone could come and say something to
[2:28:08] you and and you think that you're
[2:28:10] amongst angels and you'll find out that
[2:28:13] you know what sometimes there's some
[2:28:15] nature there that you just don't really
[2:28:16] desire sometimes people are just prickly
[2:28:18] it's their nature and they might just
[2:28:20] poke you
[2:28:22] and you know what if it's not the new
[2:28:23] birth you'll get offended and you'll
[2:28:25] leave
[2:28:27] but you're not getting offended
[2:28:28] necessarily at the people you're getting
[2:28:30] offended at the word
[2:28:32] and the troubling part about it is
[2:28:35] you're right there
[2:28:37] the truth
[2:28:39] is what sets you free not the
[2:28:41] association
[2:28:42] not being a part of a group
[2:28:44] that's why brothers and sisters it's so
[2:28:46] important to get the Holy Ghost in your
[2:28:48] life because even if you get the Holy
[2:28:49] Ghost in your life you can be scared and
[2:28:51] and perfect love will cast out all fear
[2:28:53] someone can come and step on your toes
[2:28:55] and you might get upset
[2:28:57] but you'll forgive them
[2:28:59] someone might preach something that
[2:29:01] makes you upset
[2:29:03] but you'll go and talk to them
[2:29:05] and you'll forgive them
[2:29:07] because the Holy Ghost isn't going to
[2:29:09] hold on to stuff
[2:29:10] when we have the spirit of Christ in us
[2:29:12] we know that we don't need to get upset
[2:29:13] we don't need to be fussed because he's
[2:29:15] got everything under control
[2:29:17] brother Branham says here that not one
[2:29:19] hair of your head Shall Perish
[2:29:22] you or mine
[2:29:25] he says I'll raise you up in the last
[2:29:27] day give unto him eternal life and raise
[2:29:29] him up at the last days there it is the
[2:29:31] Revelation not them but him an
[2:29:33] individual
[2:29:34] not a group an individual
[2:29:37] and he says it again here
[2:29:39] that all hell
[2:29:41] is against this
[2:29:43] all hell is against it you can type that
[2:29:46] in all hell
[2:29:47] is against and you'll see this in Christ
[2:29:50] The Mystery of God revealed this is like
[2:29:52] two paragraphs
[2:29:54] but it's talking about the new birth
[2:29:56] and it's coming right out and saying it
[2:29:58] that it's the word of God coming to the
[2:30:01] believer
[2:30:02] through an angel
[2:30:04] the seventh angel messenger it's the
[2:30:06] word of God coming through an angel to a
[2:30:08] Believer a spouse to Christ and her
[2:30:11] either accepting the word or rejecting
[2:30:13] the word
[2:30:15] and by accepting the word she becomes
[2:30:18] pregnated with that word and when she's
[2:30:20] pregnant with that word the power of the
[2:30:23] most high overshadows her and that thing
[2:30:26] that happens that thing that comes forth
[2:30:28] in her life is what the thing is Jesus
[2:30:31] Christ
[2:30:33] Jesus Christ begins to come forth in the
[2:30:35] life of a True Believer and brothers and
[2:30:37] sisters that truly is the new birth
[2:30:38] maybe I'm preaching to the choir I
[2:30:41] believe there's probably people that
[2:30:42] have never heard this this way I know
[2:30:44] that God has revealed it to me in a way
[2:30:46] that's real clear given me the ability
[2:30:47] to be able to say it
[2:30:49] I trust that it's it's it's it's it's
[2:30:51] it's
[2:30:51] finding its marked today but he says
[2:30:54] there it is the Revelation not them but
[2:30:56] him an individual not a group an
[2:30:58] individual and all hell is against it
[2:31:01] remember we read on Wednesday behold
[2:31:03] what manner of love the father hath
[2:31:05] bestowed upon us
[2:31:07] that we should be called the sons of God
[2:31:10] again Satan hates it but we love it
[2:31:14] Satan hates revelation
[2:31:17] but we love it
[2:31:18] because Revelation shows exactly who
[2:31:21] Satan is it shows all of his tactics and
[2:31:24] it shows his destruction
[2:31:26] but we love it because it shows who we
[2:31:28] are and it shows Who We Are Who will be
[2:31:31] and it shows where we're going to end up
[2:31:34] and it shows us also where he's going to
[2:31:36] end up
[2:31:39] that we should be called the sons of God
[2:31:42] therefore the world knoweth us not
[2:31:44] because it knew him not
[2:31:46] we're crazy for even talking this way
[2:31:48] that the word's going to impregnate you
[2:31:50] what
[2:31:52] you're a Madman
[2:31:54] but brothers and sisters if it ever
[2:31:56] happens to you you do become a new
[2:31:57] creature in Christ Jesus that's the only
[2:31:59] result that can happen you can't have
[2:32:01] part of you and still have Christ you
[2:32:04] can't have the word of God impregnated
[2:32:06] in you coming forward and birthing
[2:32:09] Christ you can't have that new birth and
[2:32:12] still have the old man
[2:32:14] the only thing that's happened is you've
[2:32:17] you've come close to it but you haven't
[2:32:19] quite received it yet if you haven't
[2:32:21] actually killed the old man
[2:32:24] but therefore the world looks at us and
[2:32:26] and they don't know they they know us
[2:32:28] the world therefore the world knoweth us
[2:32:31] not because it knew him not they don't
[2:32:32] know Jesus they don't want nothing to do
[2:32:34] with Jesus right
[2:32:37] but beloved to the very next verse
[2:32:40] now are we the sons of God
[2:32:42] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[2:32:45] be but we know that when he shall appear
[2:32:48] we shall be like him for we shall see
[2:32:50] him as he is
[2:32:51] you know I learned a lesson a little
[2:32:53] while ago talking about the coming and
[2:32:55] the appearing
[2:32:56] brother Branham said very clearly in the
[2:32:58] message of the hour the appearing is now
[2:33:02] and how many years ago was that
[2:33:05] 50 years ago
[2:33:07] the appearing is now seeing the son of
[2:33:09] man Ministry that that that one that
[2:33:12] came down and Stood Beside brother
[2:33:14] Branham on the stage where people would
[2:33:16] feel something and he would say you feel
[2:33:18] that don't you and they would say yes I
[2:33:21] do and he would say that's him that's
[2:33:23] the angel of the Lord that's the
[2:33:25] appearing
[2:33:27] but to look at it he's not making a
[2:33:30] great image unto himself
[2:33:33] what he has is Sons and Daughters of God
[2:33:35] and that's his chosen vessel that's the
[2:33:37] way he's chosen to express himself to
[2:33:39] this Dying World not not a great
[2:33:41] Association not a great church not a
[2:33:43] great steeple
[2:33:46] not that
[2:33:48] simple men and simple women
[2:33:52] and I say that because I'm pretty simple
[2:33:53] myself
[2:33:56] but it's true
[2:33:58] he doesn't choose intellectual Giants
[2:34:01] he doesn't choose great wealthy people
[2:34:04] remember Jesus came to the publicans and
[2:34:07] the sinners
[2:34:08] it's just amazing that we have the
[2:34:10] ability to hear his voice in our day you
[2:34:12] know what I'll call I'll call the
[2:34:13] musicians we're at 12 o'clock now
[2:34:17] in first John
[2:34:18] chapter 4 verse 17 maybe stand with me
[2:34:21] this morning as we close
[2:34:22] brother Branham says herein is our love
[2:34:24] made perfect that we have may have
[2:34:27] boldness in the day of judgment
[2:34:30] because as he is
[2:34:32] he is
[2:34:34] but as he is so are we
[2:34:37] in this world
[2:34:39] there is no fear in love
[2:34:42] but perfect love it casts out all fear
[2:34:45] perfect love casteth out
[2:34:48] all fear
[2:34:51] you ever seen someone that's afraid
[2:34:55] they're in torment
[2:34:56] aren't they
[2:34:58] I can tell you and I've told the
[2:35:00] testimony before
[2:35:02] that family trip that we went to
[2:35:04] Victoria I was afraid
[2:35:06] and I don't even know why why would I be
[2:35:08] so afraid about our business maybe it
[2:35:10] would have been good if God took it away
[2:35:11] from us but I had misquoted something so
[2:35:14] terribly and it was only like thirty
[2:35:16] thousand dollars
[2:35:17] but to me that was everything
[2:35:19] and I felt like I was so afraid of it
[2:35:22] because what would we do lose our
[2:35:24] business what would our children do what
[2:35:25] would our wife do would my wife leave me
[2:35:28] because I I'm a loser and
[2:35:30] all this
[2:35:32] silly fear
[2:35:34] Creeps in and you know what you become a
[2:35:36] bond a slave to it you wind up in
[2:35:39] bondage again to fear if you listen to
[2:35:43] that but you need to have perfect love
[2:35:45] in your life brothers and sisters
[2:35:47] because when you do perfect love grabs
[2:35:50] that fear by the throat and throws it up
[2:35:52] against the wall and puts its finger in
[2:35:54] its nose and says you have no ability to
[2:35:57] be here anymore you have no Authority
[2:35:59] here
[2:36:00] and what does it do
[2:36:02] by the throat it casts that fear out
[2:36:07] all of that fear goes
[2:36:11] perfect love cast out all fear brothers
[2:36:13] and sisters because fear hath torment
[2:36:16] we're not tormented
[2:36:18] we're Sons and Daughters of God we know
[2:36:19] who we are
[2:36:21] and we know what we're raised up for to
[2:36:23] be the dwelling place of the most high
[2:36:26] when that power of the highest shall
[2:36:28] overshadow you that thing that you'll
[2:36:30] bring forth in your life
[2:36:32] it's not going to be a church
[2:36:34] Association it's not going to be a
[2:36:36] message person it's going to be the Lord
[2:36:39] Jesus Christ period
[2:36:41] and brothers and sisters that's his
[2:36:43] chosen method that's his way
[2:36:46] we can't change that
[2:36:49] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[2:36:51] love
[2:36:53] we don't have to fear brothers and
[2:36:54] sisters
[2:36:56] I'll just say this here one last little
[2:36:58] quote
[2:36:59] but his mystery
[2:37:02] is only revealed to his beloved bride
[2:37:05] that's the only one that could see it
[2:37:08] Christ in you the hope of glory that
[2:37:11] mystery that's been hid from all the
[2:37:13] generations there's only one person one
[2:37:17] one one body the many membered body
[2:37:21] of Jesus Christ there's only one person
[2:37:23] the Bride of Jesus Christ that has the
[2:37:25] ability to see that everyone else in
[2:37:27] this world will miss it it will just go
[2:37:29] completely past them they'll say seventh
[2:37:31] angel you're crazy
[2:37:33] Christ in you you're crazy
[2:37:35] you you're crazy the new birth meh maybe
[2:37:39] a little bit but I still have me and I
[2:37:41] still have all the things in this life
[2:37:42] that I love
[2:37:45] it's not the way it works it's the old
[2:37:48] man he dies out completely brother
[2:37:49] Branham says but his mystery is only
[2:37:52] revealed to his beloved bride that's the
[2:37:56] only one that could see it and blessed
[2:37:58] are your eyes brothers and sisters if
[2:38:00] you have the ability to see this word
[2:38:02] today
[2:38:03] because the power of the highest if you
[2:38:05] can just imagine those words the power
[2:38:07] of the highest
[2:38:09] of overshadow thee and that thing that
[2:38:12] will come forward in your life is Jesus
[2:38:15] Christ
[2:38:16] my goodness let's just go to him in
[2:38:18] prayer
[2:38:19] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[2:38:22] thankful for your word we're so thankful
[2:38:24] for your grace and for your mercy Lord
[2:38:27] for your Plan of Redemption from before
[2:38:29] the foundation of the world there's so
[2:38:32] many things that we could list off that
[2:38:33] we're thankful for but Lord Jesus the
[2:38:36] one thing that I believe I can say I'm
[2:38:38] the most thankful for is the new birth
[2:38:40] Lord Jesus we can see Mark 16 in action
[2:38:43] all day long and still be lost but oh
[2:38:46] Father to have the ability to receive
[2:38:49] your word into our spiritual womb Lord
[2:38:51] God that's the next level that's that's
[2:38:54] out of this world father to be able to
[2:38:56] hear your word and receive it into our
[2:38:59] worm womb and to be able to give birth a
[2:39:02] new birth to your life through us what a
[2:39:05] tremendous thing that is Lord Jesus
[2:39:07] father I just want to pray a special
[2:39:09] blessing upon each one who's listening
[2:39:11] this morning Father that every single
[2:39:13] one would be able to receive that kind
[2:39:15] of blessing Lord to be able to take and
[2:39:18] hear your word and be able to say be it
[2:39:20] unto me according to Thy word to receive
[2:39:22] that word
[2:39:24] uninhibitedly just just unreserve it
[2:39:27] into our womb spiritually Lord and just
[2:39:29] allow you to manifest in our lives to
[2:39:32] just grow in our lives Lord Jesus in a
[2:39:35] way that maybe we've never experienced
[2:39:36] father
[2:39:38] that Lord that most of all we would be
[2:39:40] able to recognize what we are that we
[2:39:43] are truly your body on Earth again
[2:39:46] father that we could just recognize that
[2:39:48] and then see the Rapture to go but we
[2:39:50] know until that day or if you take us
[2:39:53] the way of the Grave whatever happens
[2:39:54] Lord we're yours once we've received
[2:39:57] your seed word word father we just love

[2:40:06] would give us traveling mercies that you
[2:40:07] would bring us back again at the
[2:40:09] appointed time father we pray that you
[2:40:11] would just bless each one in our absence
[2:40:13] father that you would just bless the
[2:40:15] brothers who are putting their shoulders
[2:40:16] to the wheel to to feed the sheep Lord
[2:40:18] to watch over the flock oh Father we
