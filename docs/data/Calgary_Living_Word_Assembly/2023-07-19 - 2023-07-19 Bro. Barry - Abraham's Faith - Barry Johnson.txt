careful to give you all the praise and all the glory father we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians tonight certainly amazing to see a full stage of musicians every chair is full just amazing God bless you all tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to read a couple of scriptures hopefully something to encourage you with just felt led today to go a certain direction many times I wonder Lord how why where and he never disappoints I'd just like to read from Romans chapter 7 tonight maybe real familiar scriptures and then just over the page in Romans chapter 8. sometimes I just think it's real good to just be encouraged by the word Romans chapter 7 I'd like to read just one verse verse 18. and then Romans 8 verse 11. Romans 7 verse 18. for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not Romans 8 verse 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord I believe that we have just asked a question and Lord you've given an answer just in two scriptures father and I believe that if we were to just close our Bibles and go home tonight already father that we would be blessed just by hearing your word father tonight we pray that you would take the words that are spoken father and just break them open to us fresh Lord that you would feed us Lord that when we leave here tonight we would say truly you spoke to us father give us Hearts to receive that which you want spoken to the church tonight we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just for a few moments I'll try not to go along tonight certainly thankful for the service last Wednesday brother Emanuel for putting your shoulder to the wheel and certainly thankful I don't know if I say it enough and I I just forgive me if I don't I'm certainly thankful for the specials it's amazing to see the gifts in the body and the people that want to express those gifts don't ever be bashful for it and I want it to be clear I'll never get upset because we don't have enough time to preach seemingly if people want to sing obviously there's an order to the service but if you have a special you want to bring every single week it's okay you can do it and I believe the body of Christ is blessed by it what happens is we're setting an atmosphere where he can move in and it's a tremendous thing and many times when we feel like we don't want to do it that's the best time to do it if the Lord has put something on our heart thank you brother Emanuel for taking the service last week tremendous service I took it in uh in the recording and certainly thankful for the specials in the body just a couple of announcements before we get too far into this we've got the uh I was talking to brother Joel about this where's brother General there's brother Joel the uh I figured we should call it something now and I'm going to say it tonight from the pulpit we're going to have the unofficial annual Calgary youth Fellowship weekend this weekend and uh hopefully soon we'll make it the official annual Calgary youth Fellowship weekend but we'll just see what the Lord will do we seem to have more and more interest and uh it's a tremendous thing for the Joel and Sister Crystal have a gift for hospitality and creating activities that the youth can engage in and that truly is a gift and we're certainly thankful for that in the body and the desire to participate in that so this weekend is going to be a fellowship at their new home they're opening it up and then they're going to have a Saturday hike as well and we just want to remember everyone in prayer that they'll be safe on the hike and that the Lord will bless their Fellowship it's important to Fellowship especially for the young people it's critical in fact the relationships need to be developed as friends and potential spouses as well not saying that we're creating an environment for spousal connections don't get me wrong but we know as Believers you want your children to associate with Believers you don't want them going out in the world and trying to find a spouse and think that you can convert them to get the Holy Ghost it ain't going to work that way it doesn't work that way you need to find someone who is a Believer who believes this word and what better way than to have Christian Fellowship so um I'm certainly thankful we're going to have a busy weekend then we will have a potluck on Sunday potluck fellowship and we'll be supplying some pizza for that just to try something different and we'd appreciate it if you could bring a side dish to go along with it maybe solids or desserts or whatever but I'm sure everyone has already seen the communication from Lisa my wife and we just trust it'll be a wonderful weekend the summer sure is a wonderful time we have a different sort of perspective on things children are out of school and you know it's uh it's quite easy to stay up late and uh and to sleep in and if we're not careful it can it can be a habit-forming thing but we have of lives that we need to tend to and usually that keeps us out of trouble tonight I want to just start from a couple weeks ago where I left off I think it was just such an amazing thing um service that brother Ben took I I just can't really get away from it and out of the fundamental foundation for Faith it's a quote that I read last time but I just want to say it again um I'm not even sure what paragraph it is but brother Branham he says now Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate to Satan sends a cancer the man recognized it receives it Satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more ought god with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it which he does doesn't he if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it how much more ought God to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power gifts manifestation of the spirit the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things remember we've been saying it where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and that's not just brother Berry talking about maybe a a Pentecostal slant where the services are people get excited because the spirit of Lord is there and there's liberty and sure enough that's a true scripture where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty people want to clap their hands they want to scream they want to shout they maybe want to run around the building they just can't contain themselves maybe musicians play Loud they play fast it's the spirit of the Lord there's liberty but I believe it goes further than that and and I want to sort of harp on that tonight the spirit of the Lord bringing Liberty is to understand brothers and sisters we're not bound by Satan and his laws as Believers of this word for our day we're Bound by the word for our day which is absolute Liberty over Satan and his laws and I think it's just so beautiful when we look at this scripture in Romans chapter 7 verse 18 I know that in me is it that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing how many people can say that you can look in the mirror and say man I know there's nothing good in my life many times we know what the problem is show me the solution telling me there's a problem doesn't do me any good I already know that I've got this problem I already know that I've got this thing you know what happens is sometimes people they get stuck under law and legalism and when they're under law and legalism they're continually looking at the problems in their own life and especially in other people's lives but if we can stop doing that stop looking at the problems and start looking at the promise brothers and sisters the problems melt away the problems have no more power over us I just think it's so beautiful though Verse 18 for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing there's nothing good in our flesh we're born in sin shaped and iniquity come into this world speaking of life we are in this hybrid condition we never did it for to will is present with me we know that when the disciples went with Jesus into the garden he said just Terry here and I'm just going to go a little further and I'm going to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane and the and the disciples couldn't even stay awake they couldn't even stay awake to pray and and Jesus came back a couple times didn't he and he found him sleeping a couple times and he said you know Kat you just Terry for a knock out you just pray for an hour can't you just take your time and and pray for an hour even keep your eyes awake but then he said you know what I get it you live in this hybrid condition the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing and he said those words and then he said up let's go the man of Perdition is here he knew his time had come at that point but here we have this this scripture here I know that it that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for it to will is present with me I desire to my will is there but how to perform that which is good I find not and I just want to say this for those people who say I I look at the message of the hour I try living the message of the hour I just can't live it and walk away and maybe just sort of On The Fringe because I don't know anybody that can live the message of the hour no one can live the message of the hour no one can live the message of the hour the only way we'll ever be able to live the message of the hour is for us to die and for him to live the message of the hour through us that's the only way you can be a believer of this word for today you can say you believe God sent a prophet you can have all the books and tapes you could be raised in a message Church in a message home that does all the right message things but until you have that same spirit that raised Jesus Christ out of the Grave until that happens it's just the law and and it'll always be a question we'll always Wonder Isn't there something more but tonight I want to talk about that I want to talk about the Glorious Liberty of him that has raised Christ out of the Dead out of the Grave because what happens when that happens if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you not in your church not in your family not in your pastor not in the deacons if he dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies not by attendance to church not by associations not by positionally placing yourself geographically in the world but by his spirit that dwelleth in you that's the only way it's going to happen that's the only way that it will Quicken our mortal bodies and I think it's so beautiful because it answers that question I I don't know how to do this how to perform that which is good I find not and here we have Paul getting the Revelation just turn the page Paul and just continue writing Paul and Paul writes it that if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead I get it if that same Spirit dwells in your mortal body it will Quicken your mortal body if the Same Spirit could raise Jesus from the dead then it can raise our Same Spirit from the dead it can take us from the law of sin and death and take us unto the law of Liberty of Christ that's come unto us to set us free from those things brother Adam goes on to say so I believe this with all my heart I believe that we're nearing the age that when people are going to recognize these things and what I want to get to tonight brothers and sisters is to recognize these things isn't to recognize God's not a prophet not to recognize there's Divine Healing in the church which God did both both of those things have happened but to recognize who we are to recognize that that same Spirit quickens us to this word it gives us the ability to have the Liberty to be free from this flesh to not look at this flesh kind of like I was talking about on Sunday that story about the snake we can look at the snake and say oh my I rebuke you I can hear your rattle I know you're there I can even see you I can see the shed I can see oh I know all about that snake that problem and I continue to look at that problem and that problem I keep hearing that problem and that problem and that problem what about the promise what about just walking away and just going down the pathway and you can eventually you won't hear that rattlesnake shaking you won't hear it at all and eventually it'll be gone you won't even think about it and it'll just be looking through your pictures one day you'll be like wow there was that problem on the pathway how many times in our lives have we experienced that as believers we've gone into the Glorious Liberty of Christ in our lives and suddenly we remember that thing whoa that thing that used to bug me how but I can't hear the rattle of that anymore I don't have any part of that anymore in my life what's happening is we're recognizing these things that brother radam says that we've had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it has set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and take away from the word of God and you know what I would say one of the worst things that's happened around the message of the hour is for people to rise up thinking that they've got a Ministry to draw men unto themselves vain philosophy taking people and teaching them things they ought not to be taught what about just teach them the word show them what the prophet of God said and let God do the work it's not a man thing but now I want to get to where we want to go to tonight I just think it's so beautiful because we can recognize all that Satan's done oh I got this cancer oh I've got this sickness oh I've got this problem my finances my marriage my children all these problems and things in our lives stop looking at those brothers and sisters get the token and just hold that token and remind Satan you know what you can show me all of your things but I want to show you this this is the token of the holy ghost in my life and whether I see it whether I feel it it doesn't matter to me God said and I believe and that's all that matters that doesn't even affect me when Satan says stuff like that even though it does but I'm going somewhere tonight with this you might look at me and and maybe I sound like I'm crazy I feel like it's awfully quiet tonight and I'm sorry I don't want to sound like a lunatic here but you know what Abraham was a lunatic in his day wasn't he and that's really what we're getting to think about the story of Abraham in his life and and some quotes that brother Branham talks about it how much criticism he must have had you're calling yourself Abraham brother Branham says his family said your name was Abram you're calling yourself Abraham father of Nations you're 100 years old you think you're going to have a child you're crazy but we know the word of God says that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving God praise he understood that God said it and that's all that mattered and you know in our day if we could just believe that God said it truly believe that God said it and that's all that matters it will change everything in our lives what it will do firstly is it will dull that rattlesnake sound of Satan in our lives we need to tune him down and turn up the word in our lives and the only way that happens is by believing and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word faith is what's going to unlock this for us you know in Romans 8 chapter Romans 8 12. I just was reading this I'll read 11 first but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you we know that word Quicken means to bring to life it's not going to make us speed up and and be able to do different things in our lives it's going to Quicken our bodies and give us life life Eternal We'll have eternal life right now in our bodies in this flesh that we live in and that eternal life is going to be that logos that that little lick of fire that we come together to bring together to make one lick of fire to burn bright before the Lord but here we have this scripture and the next verse verse 12 says therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh we're not looking at the flesh to live after the flesh but when we see that in our lives when we're looking at the flesh I just want to remind us tonight we're looking at the wrong thing brothers and sisters don't look at the flesh don't look at your flesh don't look at mine this flesh has to perish brother Branham says it real clearly that you can't see the real me and I can't see the real you we're stuck in this theophany in this body I mean we're not in our theophany body our theophany body is the perfect body that's the image that Christ sees us and that God sees us in he doesn't even see us in this condition he hears our voice he wants to hear what our confession is he wants to hear our words what we say because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so where we are in our hearts and in our minds what we're going to do is express it through our mouths that's why I've said so many times we can give the devil Credence or we can give the word of God Jesus Christ power in our lives credence therefore brethren we are not debtors we are dead or sorry not to the flesh to live after the flesh in the Amplified Bible that it says so then brethren we are debtors but not to the flesh we are not obligated to our carnal nature Satan wants us to believe that we're obligated to our carnal nature especially when we start to talk about past family traits and different things that are associated around maybe genetics and maybe my dad had a bad temper so that's why I've got a bad temper and I can't help it it's just the way it's been maybe his dad had a bad temper and you know what that is it's a spirit and that Spirit gets around us and it just wants us to give it Credence it wants to give us get us to speak about it but but here we have this this word I just think it really brings it out a little bit we are not obligated to our carnal nature if someone in our lives had in our family has had a temper or someone has maybe had a a what would you call it a genetic defect where that person in the family maybe a grandfather a grandmother or an aunt an uncle a mother or father has something where they've had cancer in their body that's that's what the devil wants us to say well we've got this carnal nature and we're just stuck with it and we're going to have to deal with it and if we say it that way then we will be but we're not obligated to our carnal nature brothers and sisters that's what I want to point out we are not obligated to our carnal nature it says to live a life ruled by the standard set up by the dictates of our flesh but this whole entire world is set up exactly that way that we will live according to the dictates of our flesh I knew somebody once who who was living a relatively normal life and they discovered that they had been diagnosed with something they they weren't feeling right one day and and they they went and got diagnosed and it it was a disease that wasn't life-threatening disease but certainly slightly life-altering and and they told me about it and they were really really shaken up by it because it's not a good thing to get a diagnosis from a doctor is it I mean especially a bad one I don't want to I don't want to say that it's easy and you know it's just been a bed of roses for me so I can I can say physically I have never had that terrible thing given to me so you know it's pretty easy to talk I understand that but but this this fellow he said to me had this diagnosis from the doctor and I said to him you know you don't have to embrace it you don't have to say I'm going to wholeheartedly accept it and then just make it mine you can say maybe that's what the doctor said but I just don't know if I believe it or not and I'm not willing to accept it to be the end-all in my life but they didn't listen to me not that they would maybe they shouldn't I'm not saying that I'm Authority on anything but just sadly they embraced it and their life has spiraled to a place now where they're afraid to even just go out out of their house because they're afraid they'll get sick whereas just before they were going out and they were functioning in society but now they're shut in and it's really sad to see but I just think we have the ability to accept the word or to reject the word that's really what it comes down to and we will we will project what's in our lives what's in our hearts whether we speak it or whether we just live it it's going to come out we can't hide it so then brethren we are debtors not to the flesh we are not obligated to our carnal nature to live a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates of the flesh I just think it's such an amazing thing and my goal tonight brothers and sisters I believe the whole entire desire is to just encourage us to not look at this world let's look at the word of God and the promise that waits for us that New Jerusalem City for the Believers let's not get fussed on the little details and and the little problems the issues that are in our lives remember uh was it is it is it is it brother Gary Walker I think he's the one that said it when when he got that Revelation in his life if he were to go on the other side what would what would he say it would be worth at all all of the struggle that he had to go through from that car accident and all the rehabilitation and all the setbacks and all the problems he said if he had to go through this all and and he was on the other side looking back he would say it was worth every single bit of it and the struggles that we go through in our lives are for a purpose it's to bring out the the example of his life in us and and I think that we all have the opportunity to express that and that's why we're here tonight that's why we're here in this world you know in in uh bear with me for a second here I've got some quotes I always do God's provided place of worship in 1965. brother he says and in the First Corinthians 12 it said by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body now after you're in this body Romans 8 1 said there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is the place where there is no condemnation and I think this is just so beautiful because it can draw every one of us together I know we all come from different backgrounds different places geographically different churches sometimes it's even different it's different different beliefs around the message of the hour but we're not interested in looking at that and I wouldn't recommend looking at that in anyone I I would look beyond that into the heart of the person and see how they believe the word of God brother Bradham he says there is the place where there is no condemnation whether you go to a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Church wherever it is if you are in Christ you are a new creature and there is no condemnation in you nowhere at all can you believe that does it feel like that in our lives there's no condemnation anywhere at all I don't know maybe someone has that feeling but I sure don't feel that just being honest I think it's amazing because that's what the word of God says that's what the prophet of God said that's what God said to us through the prophet if you are in Christ you are a new creature and there is no condemnation in you nowhere at all that's God's meeting place that's where God meets the worshiper isn't that interesting that's not where the worshiper meets God that's where God comes and meets the worshiper there is where you are accounted a new creature for they're dead to the things of the world they're alive in him the presence of God is with them day by day I just think it's so beautiful that's why I'm reading it I hope it's okay tonight paragraph 101 he lives in them through every age every age that's come along down through the Bible where Man meets God's requirement what's God's requirement for today brothers and sisters only believe and when you believe you'll get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and all of this just becomes a wide open brand new book to us doesn't it he lives in them through every age this age included I think is what really spoke to me here every age that's come along down through the Bible when a man meets God's requirement comes into the place where to where he provided in his written word for that day God makes that person to be a new creature and he has no condemnation look at job my goodness he says am I deafening you the way that I'm in these mics and I I'm sorry about it I want to say the same thing too it just gets me excited when I I read this myself I I know it's the rebound in here I hear it in here myself he says but look job regardless of how many people tried to condemn him how many said he was wrong he was keeping the Commandment of God by that burnt offering I'm not going into the story of job tonight but I just want to remind us that that was all he had to do was not move from his sacrifice to not move from his position not say that oh my my house is gone and my children are gone and my business is gone and now I've got to move away because somehow something has happened in my life and I just I just don't know what to do he stayed right there and what did he do he gave God something to honor with that he knowed he was justified because he was keeping the Commandments of God that's how he was justified because he was doing the things that God wanted him to do now what I'm saying by him staying right there is nothing moved him from his ultimate belief in the word of God whether we move from Calgary to another location that's not what I'm saying we didn't move off of our Ash Heap is what job did he stayed right there where he had offered that sacrifice we stay right where we believe the word of God nobody will ever be able to tell us that God is not real that the message of the hour isn't truly sent to us from God I just think it's amazing verse 13 for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if ye through the spirit do you mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live Romans 8 13. if you live after the flesh he shall die you know like they say if you live by the gun you'll die by the gun if you live by the sword you'll die by the sword if you live by the flesh you'll die by the flesh you're busy looking at other people's flesh all their behaviors and all their problems and all the churches and all their behaviors and all their problems and the deacons and the song leaders and all the problems the problems the problems it's just going to be a problem and eventually you're going to be a problem but if you're looking at the Spirit of Christ if you're looking at the word of God if you're saying you know what I understand that if I live after the flesh I'll die but but I through the the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body then I shall live it gives me the ability to recognize I can have Grace for my brothers and my sisters I can have Grace for the other pastors even the ones that I look at and I see that maybe they're off the word they don't want to be off the word they want to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered for the Saints it's not up to me to judge them it's up to God to judge them it's up to me to have the right response to pray for them to have Grace for them he says we have to have Temptation in our lives it's healthy for us out of who is this Melchizedek 1965. he says but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin I was reading this this afternoon and I thought that's amazing I don't know if I've ever really thought of it that way that I had to come down here have you ever thought about that you had to come down here I I know that I came from Christ before the foundation of the world but I've always thought about him coming down here from heaven right to manifest In the Flesh like we talked about on Sunday but I never thought about me having to come down here but I did and so did you you had to come down here you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin Jesus had to come down here to be manifest In the Flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and I'll raise him up on the last day see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute to before the foundation of the world his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition so just to recap this maybe for those people who don't understand it we're talking about him being Elohim the self-existing one then he comes down in the form of Melchizedek he comes down in the form of of those three the one plus the two angels that went to visit Abram to tell him he had a new name just before he went to judge Sodom he he came down and and he would appear and he would disappear and then he came and became flesh he became flesh and returned back again resurrected that same time that same body in a glorified condition as Jesus Christ that's what brother Adam was talking about he says but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin so Brethren sisters don't think it strange when we're tempted sore recognize that that was what God wanted for us and it wasn't so that we could be destroyed it so that we could overcome to set with him in his throne and what are we going to overcome we're going to overcome sin in the world and Satan and all of that but more than anything we're going to overcome this guy this flesh this flesh is going to give way to his spirit and it doesn't I I just think it's so amazing and maybe this is the point to get to tonight it might not give way to his spirit in the way that we think maybe it's not going to be a splitting of the flesh the skin from from top to bottom and and suddenly this new creature is just going to emerge like we're coming out of our old skin and going into a new skin and then we're just going to slowly rise to the sky that's not what's going to happen brothers and sisters what's going to happen is we're going to be able to say Amen to the word and you know what when we fall down in our flesh when we have a problem with a brother or a sister we're gonna go and make that thing right we're going to be like David who is a man after God's Own Heart and what made him that way brother Bradham said he was quick to repent we're going to be quick to repent when we see these traits these attributes happening in our lives brothers and sisters I believe that gives us the ability to recognize the key has gone in the lock and it's turned and now it's unlocked for us we have the ability to recognize that we've already made ourselves seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when we can believe the word of God but if we're still questioning it and saying hi I don't know look at that brother I don't know look at this situation or well you know would I have this situation if I really believed we're not living in the first and second poll Ministry of the word of God we're living in the third poll why cry speak we're living in the third pole Ministry of the word the expression the fullness of the word now being manifest through Mankind and where brothers and sisters not some great ministry out there you're the great ministry right here in your life in in the Sons and Daughters of God but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God how does it throw this body into subjection to God brothers and sisters I want to say it clearly it puts us in subjection to the word of God that was given to this age through the prophet of Malachi 4. we don't say oh we follow a man we follow the word of God because the word that came from that man was exactly in the line of the word of God it brought us back it restored the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers he that's born of God does not commit sin are you born of God tonight then you can't even sin brothers and sisters my you can't even sin even if you want to it doesn't mean that you go out and and rob a bank and you go out and you do all these sinful things of course we don't want to do that but we're talking about being able to believe the word of God because unbelief is sin not believing the word of God is sin and and taking and making the message of the hour comfortable to fit our lives is not according to the word of God that's not going to make us any better this is going to actually challenge us it's going to stretch us it's gonna it's gonna show who we are but you know we're in a place where where there's no time for playing this is no time for playing Church no time to to see whether this is just the real thing or not I'm just gonna wait and see whether it becomes something more than it is or or whether it's of God or whether it's not this is no time to play Church Brothers and Sisters this is the end of all time this is the end of all ages you can talk to anybody in this world and they'll say yeah this world can't stay the way it is it's about to blow up and maybe not in in terms of nuclear bombs I don't know I don't want to say it that way but maybe civil unrest look at the way the governments are look at how people everyone's got an opinion now and it doesn't matter they have the right to voice it it wasn't very long ago where you had to have respect for the government where you had to have respect for your elders but now teachers will get in trouble for saying the wrong thing teachers will get fired for saying the wrong thing defund the police where did all this lack of respect come from this world is not our home brothers and sisters this world is on the brink of something really significant and I think it's so beautiful I want to say this I had this this this thought in the back room tonight you know it's terribly dark as this world is brothers and sisters it's going that way for one reason and that reason is to show how bright you're burning to show how bright that Pillar of Fire is in his elect Lady it's not so that we can be drowned out and smothered out it's so that we can show really who we are and nice and bright it throws this body into subjection to God hallelujah he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just he says just get in Christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and that's why we get baptized as an outward expression of the inward work of of the belief that it's not to be baptized in the name of the father that's on the Holy Ghost who is the father there's no name there and who's the son there's no name there it's not getting a trinitarian baptism it's getting baptized in Christian baptism according to Acts 2 38 which was restored unto the church which causes the children's Hearts to be drawn back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers to say wow that's been laying there in plain sight all day long we know brother Branham says it in the church H book it's in plain sight you don't have to get a revelation about water baptism it's right there the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he says they're dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life many times we're going to fall down our theophonies will live a perfect life our theophanes are already living a perfect life before God right now in another dimension which is just right here the theophanes are already perfect we can't try and get these bodies to be a theophany body we we can't try and be an angel and live as an angel we're Sons and Daughters of God living in the Fallen condition we're not going to make Grace a disgrace but we're always going to bring these bodies back into subjection of the word of God that's the difference between a Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever is going to say I don't know I don't know I can't live it and that's what the believer says no you can't and neither can I but his spirit that lives within me he can and I will always come subject to the word of God I think it's beautiful if you have your Bibles tonight maybe turn with me over to Hebrews chapter 11. still have a little bit of time a little bit of time I just want to get this across tonight I think it's the main theme the main point many times I wonder if this makes sense when I put it together like Lord does it really make sense Hebrews chapter 11. verses 6. verse 6. we need to remember this as we go but without faith it is impossible to please him we have to have faith brothers and sisters without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him not he will be or he was but that he is present tense I am and you know I'm no grammar person here I I don't know much but I just think what brother Branham says he says watch those pronouns and and I know this isn't even a pronoun and I don't think but just that he is it makes it present tense some of these things are just so minor and so small we can just easily gloss over and read over it and it's just like yeah you know he is you know something else but it's not saying that he is he is God he's not saying he is Jesus he's not saying he is theophany he is the great one he is and a comma and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him we have the ability to recognize that without faith it's impossible to please him and and we we have been given the ability to stand in our day which I think is is incredible because we get the fact that he is and for many people he's probably saying Brother Bear you just keep harping about that but I just think it's so important let's just go on let's skip down to verse eight I don't want to go off on a tangent about Noah and I will if I read verse seven that's the only reason I don't want to read it I don't want to delete any of the words so I'm not doing that I just want to stick with the faith of Abraham verse 8 says by a by faith Abraham when he was called to go into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God and through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and when was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised now this just struck me this afternoon isn't this the one Sarah the one that would have been destroyed if she wasn't a part of Abram Abraham isn't this the one that laughed up her sleeve when she heard God actually saying that to Abraham through the sidewall of the tent I'm going to visit you according to the time of life isn't she the one his wife that laughed at that statement how could I have pleasure with my Lord being past age how could that possibly be this is the one that laughed but she had judged him faithful who had promised doesn't say that Abraham had faith it says that she judged him faithful who had promise I think there's so much in here that we could unpack she believed her husband she believed her Lord not calling her husband Lord even though I believe she did but she believed the Lord she had faith how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters faith that these bodies will lie to us these bodies will deceive us these bodies are not the final answer so we need to be very very very very careful how we look at ourselves and how we look at others because it's not this body it's not this flesh that we're going to be judged by it's going to be by the spirit that's inside this body in this flesh that we can't even see Romans chapter 4 verse 20 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief talking about Abraham but was strong in faith giving glory to God maybe oh am I on the right part here yeah let's turn there let's turn to Romans chapter 4. we got to do it we still got a little bit of time I hope it's okay Romans chapter 4 . sometimes I think it's just really important to take some time and dwell on things and I think this is one that really is important for us to just recognize that the heroes in the Bible were people just like us they were no different they had flash problems we know that Abraham what did he do he he went down brother Bradham says as a backslider into Egypt and said to his wife just say that you're my sister so he could save his hide didn't he but for the grace of God to come in the form of a dream to the king and didn't this happen twice he comes in the form of a dream and tells the King give him his wife back and if you don't do it you're going to be a dead man your kingdom will be taken from you and the King says Lord you know the Integrity of my heart and he says yeah I know that's why I'm telling you but what is it here we have a king in Egypt saying to God you know the Integrity of my heart don't they believe idols and follow false gods how does that work that's where I say brothers and sisters we can't put God in a box and say that unless you believe it the way that I believe it or the way that I think I believe it that's the way it is this is a king in Egypt I don't know where that came from but anyways we we I do no sorry forgive me Lord Hebrew Romans chapter chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 verse 1. what shall we say then that Abraham Our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for If Abraham was justified by works he hath whereof took Glory but not before God but what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness this is excuse me this is separating law and Grace right there if we're thinking that our works of righteousness are going to do it we can read this word here and we can recognize our works of righteousness are not going to do it being a legalist is not going to do it having everything in our lives perfect is not going to do it but having the ability to understand but to him that worketh not I just believe on him that justifieth the ungodly because I know outside of his Spirit living inside of me I would be ungodly but for the grace of God there go I when we look at people in this world we need to make sure that we remember that outside of the grace of God we would be ranked Sinners also but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David David also describeth the blessedness blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in the circumcision or in the uncircumcision we know that that was given as a sign for the Sons and Daughters of God for the Israelis for the Hebrews in their flesh it was a sign of the flesh not in circumcision but in uncircumcision he that received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh Wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all I just want to uh yeah we have to keep going I apologize this is so long but as it is written verse 17 I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification remember in the in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Bradham says in 1965 that you are already Justified you're Justified and he says it's like you never even did it and he says that but then he goes on to say a little further that you actually never did do it if you believe this word of God because he doesn't look at us in this flesh he doesn't look at us in this condition and we know that we have Romans 4 talking here about Abraham he he had been a follower of the word of God and he followed the the steps that God had given him the leadership of the Lord in his life and there was the love of of the uncircumcision versus the law of circumcision and and all of the steps in the law but then he comes further down and he says that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong and faith-giving glory to God I just think verse 21 really applies to us also as the spiritual seed the Royal Seed of Abraham and being fully persuaded that what he had promised not what what we had promised or maybe someone in this flesh in our lives had promised because everyone in this world will disappoint us but being fully persuaded that what he had promised God Elohim the one he met in the tent door that Day In the Heat of the day what he had promised he was able also to perform and because he was fully persuaded it was therefore imputed to him for righteousness he never even sinned in his life even though the we know the word says that he was a backslaughter he went down into Egypt he gave away his wife to try and save his his height just tell him you're my sister we know that he backslid many different ways but when the true test came when he was given that promise we know brother Brown even talks about it his wife said you know what it's not happening honey we'll just do it our way here take my solution I've got a solution take Hagar you can you can still have that child but I'll make it come to pass and we know that brother Branham he said it very clearly the word of God says it very clearly God said no that's not the way it's going to come to pass you can go ahead and do it but I'm not going to count it to you as unrighteousness you're going to have some trouble in your house you're going to have some problems in your life because you didn't follow my word holy but I'm not going to hold it against you you're going to reap the rewards from it you're planting a harvest and you're going to see a problem from it but he was fully persuaded that what he was he had promised God had promised him he was able to perform it it wasn't up to Abraham to perform it I just think it's so beautiful because how many times Naturally Speaking did he stagger brothers and sisters how many times in our lives Naturally Speaking do we stagger brothers and sisters how many times do we fall down and flat on our face how many times and the devil will say oh is it really real because if it was really real would you have fallen on your face yes you would have it's because you have to overcome that thing and get back up again and that's the difference between the Believers and the people who haven't really come to that maturity level yet the Believers the true seasoned Believers get back up again and that's why I keep saying about the the elders how they come to church and they look perfect they've got no problems in their lives you know what it is they've learned to get back up again that's all it is that's why they come to church that's why we drag our carcasses into church we get back up again we don't stay down and say I can never make it I can't live it no one can on their own but boy if the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ up from the dead if it dwells in you oh my something different happens in your life you're able to forgive your brother you're able to be forgiven you are able to get back up again and come to church we don't quit Believers don't quit I just think it's beautiful though he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief that is the sin brothers and sisters unbelief but he was fully persuaded wasn't he that he was able to deliver what he promised are you able to believe that he is able to deliver what he promised in this life that we are more than Overcomers more than conquerors that we will sit with him in his throne we don't have to tolerate the devil and his tactics and his Antics we don't have to listen to his voice just brothers and sisters be fully persuaded that what he promised he's able to perform it in your lives if we have confusion in our lives he is not the author of confusion if we have sickness in our lives it's not because God gave us sickness it's because Satan gave us sickness but what we started out with at the beginning is if if Satan has these laws in this flesh how much more the spirit of God that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead when he dwells in our mortal bodies how much more does his Spirit have in our our bodies how much more does his law have in our lives I think it's so beautiful you know he didn't stumble him a bit the stuff didn't stumble Abraham a bit and works as Faith expressed two main paragraph 218. he says let's think of Abraham for just a few minutes Abraham got that Holy Union incomplete see he got the whole thing together he called things contrary to his faith as though it was not do we do that are we able to do that brothers and sisters we see things in our lives we see them with our eyes we perceive them with our senses we hear things with our ears are we able to say ah that brother that sister they didn't mean that that problem that's in front of our eyes we we don't see that it's not the way that we see it it's not the way that we perceive it with these senses in these bodies let's think of Abraham for just a few minutes Abraham got that Holy Union incomplete see he got that whole thing together he called the things contrary to his faith as though it was not and acted on the same principle because it's one thing to talk talks cheap isn't it but when we've got to act he says I can imagine after about 20 years somebody come by and said father of Nations Abram you said your name was Abraham which means father of Nations just how many children do you have right now Abraham see and you know what alls he could do is say yep you're right naturally speaking but I know whom whom I have believed and and that he is able to keep that which he had promised unto me I know I heard his voice you might not have heard it but I heard it and that's all that matters and once we've actually been able to hear his voice that way Brothers it doesn't matter who comes along doesn't matter what comes along and I want to be clear I'm not saying that I'm going to make a a statement to say that you know what you should call your sickness you don't have a sickness and you shouldn't go and see a doctor and especially as a parent when you have a child and your child's sick and you say no I'm going to call that thing as though it's not even there look they're perfectly healthy and they're white as a ghost and maybe vomiting and they've got a fever take your child to the hospital God is not afraid to use doctors we have to be responsible in our lives what I'm saying is we can take things to an extreme one way or the other remember there's a highway that's going down the road but there is a way that is a way of Holiness I believe that God will be with you even in you even right to the hospital with your child and you can say Lord direct the doctors direct these people help us find the right solution and maybe if there's a fever that it will leave but I will never ever ever be taken on record to say don't ever take your children to the doctor I would say this and I'm not going to say it I'm not going to say any more about it let God lead you get the Holy Ghost and let him lead you God uses doctors sometimes I got to be careful we have to be careful father of Nations Abram you said your name was Abraham which means father of Nations just how many children do you have right now Abram see and all she could do is agree with him right but we have brother Brown I'm saying this that didn't stumble him a bit paragraph 219 the Bible said he staggered not at the word of God through unbelief he went right ahead making ready keeping all the booties ready and the bird eye and everything he was going to have the baby that's all God said that does anybody know what a bird eye is I'd really like to know what a bird eye is it's a pin interesting probably for keeping the baby wrapped up yeah I've always for the diaper the bird eye okay thank you I had never known what that is I've always wondered it for time's sake I'm just going to read another quote here um my goodness which one is it I'll even call the musicians just so I don't keep us here proving his word 1965. paragraph 66. God wants to prove this in us he wants to hear our voice he wants us to give him the ability to move in our lives and if we get caught up in the moment brothers and sisters and start calling the things that are as though they are and the things that aren't as though they aren't then that's the way it's going to be but if we can start to look past what our senses perceive and and live like Abraham and stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but just be strong and say I don't care what anybody says because I know who's called me I know his voice and he has shown me this very clearly then he will move in our lives and it might not be today it might not be tomorrow it might not be next week it might not be a month but it will happen it has to happen because it's not up to us to bring it to pass and I believe when we get to that level when we get to that place we recognize that it's never going to be us bringing it to pass but we can get so wound up thinking there's something that we can do to bring it to pass and if it doesn't come to pass it throws Us in turmoil and then we start to question our experience on this very word don't do it brothers and sisters just trust them it's up to him to deliver on his promise it's his promise it's not ours we never made the promise he made the promise hold him to his word and see if he won't come on the scene maybe stand with me tonight as we close paragraph 66 he says the Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God his name was changed from Abram to Abraham the changing of the name made his name father of Nations could you imagine a man living with his wife his sweetheart that he had lived with her for now for all these years and now somewhere in the age of 80 years old and his wife 70 years old and yet without one child or any hope of a child yet claimed that he was the father of nation he'd be a lunatic today wouldn't he that's what we would call them crazy he says could you imagine the criticism of his passing fellow man would say father of Nations now how many children do you have at this time and all the criticism he had to go through with I believe it can happen in our lives we can start to confess something and we can if we're not careful as Believers we can start to actually have the wrong confession for our brothers and sisters we want to encourage them to believe the word of God but remember it's got to be with balance but Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at all of unbelief he believed that God was able to perform that which he had promised that God would prove his word no matter how long it took and I just want to encourage us this this way because if we are the Royal Seed of Abraham then we have those Royal genetics of Abraham when we look at those old Natures those genetics from our grandparents and our parents and maybe aunts and uncles and we think oh no I've got all this stuff it's all against me you know what don't look at that don't look at the problems look at the promise the promise is that you are the Royal Seed of Abraham and if you are the Royal Seed of Abraham then you've got the Royal genetics of Abraham and those genetic genes in Abraham said that he didn't stagger anywhere at all of unbelief he believed that God was able to perform that which he had promised that God would prove his word no matter how long it took but instead of getting weaker each time like we are prone to do he got stronger all the time if it didn't happen today tomorrow it will be a greater Miracle because that's one day older and that was God that was God in Abraham for he knowed that God proved all of his words to be so if his children and will only take his word so he can prove it by you that's the only way he can prove his word he wants to prove it and it's got to be proved through us that's why we've got to have problems that's why we've got to have circumstances and situations so that he can prove his word this is not approving his word by the way 1965 I don't know if I said that he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they can't be proved they are unbelievers but it's not two unbelievers it's not for unbelievers it's to him that belief and if he can find someone who will believe his word he will prove his word by you and sometimes sickness and things happen to us that way that God can prove himself I just want to say tonight brothers and sisters let God prove himself let him prove himself through you and and to you let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your word Lord I pray that tonight we could just allow you to prove yourself through US father Lord that you could prove yourself to us just a little further Lord Jesus as we go forwards maybe even right now in this moment tonight that we would just recognize you as the as the as the is as the I am in as the present tense I am father that there's no no problem that you don't know about there's no issue that you're not aware of there's no surprise gonna spring out of the pathway along the way you know everything from the beginning to the end and father help us to stagger not at these problems through unbelief but just to be strong oh Father like that that Abraham Gene Lord that genetic seed that you placed in us before the foundation of the world let that manifest in our lives in such a way father that it would overpower all of our senses Lord Jesus that it would give us the ability to stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but but just to be strong father believing that you will bring it to pass in each one of our Lives father Lord we love you and we thank you for your word thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord we all have so much to thank you for Lord we just want to give you all the praise and all the glory of Our Lives we just ask now that you would go with us as we go our
