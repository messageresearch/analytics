[47:33] upon us we certainly will be praying for
[47:36] you continue to pray for you that God
[47:39] will lead you and guide you in your
[47:41] positions as husband and wife certainly
[47:44] uh a little sad that I'm not going to be
[47:46] able to be there to see the marriage but
[47:49] we will actually have a little bit of a
[47:51] a gathering at our house for the uh
[47:55] reception we'll have the the Canadian
[47:57] reception here uh in Canada so we're
[48:00] certainly looking forward to your return
[48:02] as husband and wife God richly bless you
[48:05] brother tiabo and sister
[48:07] Maran you happy tonight
[48:11] amen I certainly have thoroughly enjoyed
[48:15] this um
[48:18] study in the exposition of the seven
[48:20] Church ages amen and uh you know last
[48:24] week we got into some real interesting
[48:26] things the hybrid religion how brother
[48:28] Bram talks about the mule and the donkey
[48:32] and uh how there's one that can actually
[48:35] be um continued on they can actually
[48:39] recreate themselves and the other one
[48:41] cannot and we know a hybrid religion
[48:43] cannot the spirit itself is void from a
[48:46] hybrid religion and brother Branham uses
[48:48] that comparison naturally and uh it's
[48:52] it's amazing to see it because uh there
[48:55] is no bringing forth of the spirit even
[48:57] if there is a Revival as soon as we go
[48:59] and mix man's Thoughts with that Revival
[49:02] the spirit becomes void from that
[49:05] Gathering and uh we know that people
[49:08] will continue on but like be gets like
[49:11] every seed will bring forth after its
[49:13] own kind and uh if you preach a
[49:16] Methodist Doctrine you're going to breed
[49:19] Methodist children and if you preach a
[49:22] Baptist Doctrine if you preach a
[49:24] Pentecostal Doctrine and I'll go even so
[49:26] far as to say if you just preach a
[49:28] message Doctrine you're going to preach
[49:30] message children but what we want to
[49:32] preach continually is the baptism of the
[49:35] Holy Ghost get into Christ Jesus that is
[49:38] the admonition he that hath an ear let
[49:41] him hear what the spirit says to every
[49:43] single Church age and every single
[49:45] Church age had a portion of elect
[49:48] Believers it's not just from the leoan
[49:51] church age where the elect will come
[49:53] from it's going to be very interesting
[49:55] to meet polycarp
[49:57] to shake his hand and say how did that
[50:00] go how how could you possibly have done
[50:02] that and gone through that and all of
[50:04] his disciples and all of the Believers
[50:06] from all the ages it's so wonderful but
[50:08] we talked about the hybrid religion last
[50:09] time and uh you know one of the things
[50:12] that I think is just so important to to
[50:14] make sure that we we we we maybe just
[50:17] emphasize just say it again uh because
[50:20] it's so important is brother bradam
[50:22] talks about how that the the synagogue
[50:24] of Satan under that heading the
[50:25] synagogue of Satan part of the scripture
[50:27] that we've read last week we covered
[50:29] this how they were liars and since they
[50:32] were Liars they could not make any claim
[50:34] or they could make any claim that they
[50:36] wished they could just say whatever they
[50:38] want to because they're liars and that's
[50:40] how people are when they are liars they
[50:42] can say whatever they want and really
[50:43] there's no way you can actually prove it
[50:46] and you know it's a terrible thing but
[50:48] it's a true thing uh many people in this
[50:50] world actually are and not even
[50:52] religious but you know it becomes so
[50:55] hurtful for people people who do Gather
[50:57] in the name of Jesus Christ around a
[51:01] religious gathering and and they do let
[51:04] down the bars and they get a little bit
[51:06] honest and and they do actually maybe
[51:09] expose themselves to trusting other
[51:12] people that believe that that they're in
[51:15] the same nature the same Vein The Same
[51:17] Spirit of Christ and then they find out
[51:19] not very long after they've actually
[51:21] told things about themselves that they
[51:23] were actually speaking to Liars they
[51:25] were speaking to people that don't
[51:26] actually have their best interest at
[51:28] heart and are willing to go and actually
[51:30] maybe talk about them behind their backs
[51:33] it's not a very good feeling but that
[51:35] happens in the world and we trust that
[51:37] doesn't happen in the Church of the
[51:38] Living God brother bam goes on to say
[51:41] this in paragraph 42 they could say what
[51:44] they wanted as though it were fact and
[51:47] then stick to it and in this case they
[51:51] could be I'm just going to get rid of
[51:52] that a little bit they could be lying
[51:55] with a very powerful thought in
[51:57] mind was it not so that the early church
[52:01] was almost if not entirely composed of
[52:03] Jews making them the original members of
[52:05] his body the twel apostles were Jews and
[52:09] the LA later apostles were either Jews
[52:11] or pelites thus for men to swear they
[52:14] were Jews would give them a preeminence
[52:17] and a claim to
[52:19] originality tell a lie stick to it never
[52:23] mind fact or history just just say it
[52:28] and keep saying it to the people and
[52:31] soon the people will receive
[52:34] it I just think that's so good because
[52:37] we don't have to dwell in lies but
[52:39] that's what that hybrid religion is
[52:41] built
[52:42] on WE rely on fact we rely on the truth
[52:46] of the Living God the truth of the word
[52:48] the revealed word through a Vindicated
[52:50] Prophet get the baptism of the Holy
[52:53] Spirit get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:56] and he the spirit of truth the life of
[52:58] Jesus Christ that begins to live through
[53:01] us will begin to express himself to us
[53:04] and through us and I think it's such a
[53:06] beautiful thing if you listen to the
[53:08] Token in 1963 brother bradam talks about
[53:10] the chemical life of the blood and how
[53:13] that needs to be on display we need to
[53:15] show the chemical blood we need to be
[53:16] able to show when the death angel is
[53:18] going to pass over our house when
[53:20] disease and problems are going to come
[53:21] our way we need to be able to point to
[53:23] those those those doorposts and that
[53:25] lentil that we have a that chemical
[53:27] blood but that's not it many people stop
[53:30] right there and and that is that that
[53:33] that call it that legalistic perspective
[53:35] where you get stuck in a position and
[53:36] you think that you've gone far enough
[53:37] you have not gone far enough you've got
[53:39] to see the life inside that blood not
[53:42] the chemical the life of that blood has
[53:45] to begin to live out through our lives
[53:48] and when that happens then Satan knows
[53:50] he can't touch us but until that happens
[53:53] the Devil he's got a Punch coming and
[53:55] he's going to go right for our knows
[53:57] he's not very
[53:58] kind but carrying on with what we were
[54:00] talking about last week in paragraph 77
[54:03] this is uh maybe I'll just go back to 76
[54:06] here they have a name that they live but
[54:10] are dead tongues isn't the evidence of
[54:13] Revival it is the evidence of
[54:17] death this one just about blew me away
[54:20] when I got into this tongues proclaimed
[54:22] the
[54:23] evidence that the ceremonial religion of
[54:26] the Jews was over and that a new era had
[54:31] begun that's why they were so upset they
[54:34] said these people are stumbling around
[54:35] like drunk people and you know it's
[54:37] beautiful because brother Ram really
[54:38] expresses it how you know in in in the
[54:40] book of Acts we know the story the day
[54:42] of Pentecost when it was fully come the
[54:44] the licks of fire the clothing tongues
[54:46] over their heads and they spoke in many
[54:48] different languages all the languages of
[54:49] the people around they weren't speaking
[54:50] in an unknown tongue that nobody knew
[54:53] they were speaking in something that was
[54:54] interpreted and we know that's the
[54:56] evidence of the true evidence of the
[54:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost when someone
[55:00] is speaking in tongues under the baptism
[55:03] of the Holy Ghost not that that is the
[55:04] true evidence I forgive me for saying it
[55:06] the way I did but when somebody does
[55:08] truly speak in tongues there will be an
[55:11] interpretation there will be an
[55:13] understanding of what they're saying it
[55:14] won't just be someone speaking in a
[55:16] different language and then they'll just
[55:18] phase back in and suddenly be speaking
[55:20] in English again and many times that's
[55:21] what you see when you start talking to
[55:23] religious folks they'll be talking to
[55:25] you and then all of a sudden oh they'll
[55:26] just shoot off in an unknown tongue and
[55:28] then they'll phase back and and just be
[55:30] speaking in English again but there's no
[55:32] interpretation of that and we know that
[55:34] Paul talks about that expressly but you
[55:37] know the speaking in tongues was not
[55:39] something that was actually adding to
[55:42] the Jews religion it was proclaiming
[55:44] that it was over that they chose a
[55:47] murderer and a robber and a liar just
[55:50] like Cain they chose barabus over Jesus
[55:54] Christ the Messiah and that was because
[55:57] we needed to come in we needed to
[55:59] actually see this gospel it's an amazing
[56:02] thing the way God does it brother Bron
[56:04] goes on to say tongues today is ringing
[56:07] down the curtain on the Gentile Church
[56:09] ages and the gospel is going back to the
[56:12] Jews people are talking about tongues
[56:16] heralding in a great spiritual move they
[56:19] have missed the
[56:20] boat my the truth is that it is writing
[56:25] the Finish
[56:26] to all of man's ideas programs and
[56:30] kingdoms the kingdom of God is being
[56:32] ushered in wake up people of God wake
[56:35] up now this is where I kind of find it
[56:38] hard sometimes when you get into the
[56:41] truth because we believe this to be the
[56:43] truth the absolute truth I don't think
[56:46] there's anything in here that I dispute
[56:48] I don't need to go and fact check every
[56:51] single step of the way I believe that
[56:52] this was a Vindicated Prophet that was
[56:54] sent to us for a purpose and that
[56:57] purpose was so that we could actually
[56:59] attain to rapturing Faith the faith that
[57:02] will actually change these bodies where
[57:04] the not just chemical life of the blood
[57:07] is something that we can point to and
[57:08] talk about but that literal life is
[57:10] something that preaches out to the world
[57:12] around us and even those who love us
[57:14] even to ourselves we step back after
[57:16] situations and wonder what just happened
[57:19] there that is not normal for me I don't
[57:21] know why I did that but then something
[57:23] says yeah you do you know exactly why
[57:25] because it wasn't you it was me amen but
[57:29] in paragraph 77 brother bradam says if
[57:31] you don't think this is true just listen
[57:33] to this all over the world in both
[57:36] Pentecostal and fundamental groups they
[57:40] are organizing the
[57:42] businessmen they have invaded the pulpit
[57:45] without a call from
[57:47] God they have styled themselves the
[57:50] Fishers of Men and the founders of a
[57:53] move of God and they say the gifted
[57:57] Ministry of Ephesians 410
[58:01] to13 that God gave the
[58:04] church has
[58:06] failed so they're taking
[58:09] over now I just want to pause here
[58:11] tonight and and talk about this let's
[58:13] turn over to the book of
[58:15] Ephesians let's read that scripture
[58:17] we're all very familiar with it I'm sure
[58:20] but for those who aren't I think it
[58:23] Bears the
[58:24] necessity to to make sure that we're
[58:26] pointing to this and and saying that
[58:29] this is not something that's really that
[58:31] far for and out there and maybe in some
[58:34] crazy denominational circles this is
[58:36] right close to home brothers and sisters
[58:39] the prophet was prophesying as he was
[58:41] writing these
[58:43] words Ephesians chap 4:
[58:48] 11 it's verse uh sorry 10 to
[58:53] 13 verse 10 of Ephesians chapter 4 it
[58:55] says he that descended is the same also
[58:58] that ascended up far above all Heavens
[59:01] that he might fill all things now we
[59:03] know exactly who that is there's no
[59:05] question about who that is that is God
[59:08] the Lord Jesus Christ verse 11 says and
[59:11] he gave some Apostles and some prophets
[59:15] and some evangelists and some pastors
[59:19] and teachers verse 12 for the perfecting
[59:23] of the Saints for the work of the
[59:26] Ministry for the edifying of the body of
[59:31] Christ not the bodies not the churches
[59:35] not the bride not the brides but the
[59:38] body of Christ till we all come in the
[59:43] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[59:46] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[59:48] unto the measure of the stature of the
[59:51] fullness of Christ and and what's that
[59:53] going to be what will that look like in
[59:54] our lives that will be when that literal
[59:57] blood I say literal I'll say literal
[59:59] life of the blood is pumping through our
[1:00:02] veins and we're no longer ourselves and
[1:00:05] that rapturing faith has actually taken
[1:00:07] hold in our lives and we no longer have
[1:00:09] the little disputings that we have going
[1:00:12] on we come into the unity of the faith
[1:00:15] and we understand that this is God's
[1:00:17] work and he's going to do it however
[1:00:19] he's going to do it but how is he going
[1:00:21] to do it he's going to do it with
[1:00:23] Apostles and he's going to do it with
[1:00:25] prophets and he's going to do it with
[1:00:27] evangelists and pastors and teachers
[1:00:31] amen but there's some people that will
[1:00:33] sing the song Ephesians 4 is not enough
[1:00:37] now brothers and sisters that's around
[1:00:38] the message that's Dangerous Waters
[1:00:41] that's right because we had one
[1:00:43] Vindicated Prophet for this age that was
[1:00:46] the major prophet that fulfilled the
[1:00:47] scripture there's not two there's no
[1:00:50] Apostolic
[1:00:52] succession the rapturing faith lies on
[1:00:54] the tapes that's good
[1:00:56] but that rapturing faith that lies on
[1:00:58] the tapes needs to be expounded upon the
[1:01:00] prophet even said so some of you young
[1:01:02] ministers take this and expound upon it
[1:01:04] I don't have the time to do that amen
[1:01:07] but how can we actually be perfected if
[1:01:10] we take this out and we say that
[1:01:11] Ephesians 4 is not enough oh we don't
[1:01:14] need to you know what if we do that then
[1:01:16] we can start tearing out other pages in
[1:01:18] The Bible we could say you know what I I
[1:01:19] I could have multiple wives I could put
[1:01:22] my wife away for whatever you know how
[1:01:24] it goes you could start to do whatever
[1:01:25] you want to do we don't want to do that
[1:01:28] we want to take the word of God we want
[1:01:30] to take the absolute and say yes indeed
[1:01:33] it is for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:01:35] it's not just playing a tape put them
[1:01:37] back in the Pulpit God took him out of
[1:01:39] the pulpit why did he take him out of
[1:01:41] the
[1:01:42] pulpit so that he could have an anointed
[1:01:44] Ministry so that there could be men who
[1:01:47] preach this gospel under the anointing
[1:01:50] of the Holy Ghost amen now rapturing
[1:01:53] faith lies on a tapes but what are we
[1:01:55] supposed to to do leave it there we're
[1:01:57] supposed to eat the book we're supposed
[1:01:59] to consume those tapes we're supposed to
[1:02:01] listen to them we're supposed to feed
[1:02:02] upon them we need those tapes we need
[1:02:05] the books we need to feed on the message
[1:02:07] of the hour so that not that we can say
[1:02:09] that we just feed on the message of the
[1:02:11] hour so that we can become the message
[1:02:13] of the hour that's the purpose of the
[1:02:15] tapes brothers and sisters amen
[1:02:17] Ephesians 4 isend enough that is the
[1:02:21] perfecting of the Saints so going back
[1:02:23] to this I just want to read this again
[1:02:25] they have styled themselves the Fishers
[1:02:26] of Men the founders of the move of God
[1:02:28] and say that the gifted Ministry of
[1:02:30] Ephesians 4:10 to13 that God gave the
[1:02:34] church has
[1:02:35] failed so they are taking
[1:02:39] over here we are right in the midst of
[1:02:42] the Fulfillment of Prophecy called the
[1:02:45] gains sayings of
[1:02:46] Kora and they don't even know that they
[1:02:50] have fulfilled
[1:02:51] it they are blindly going on preaching
[1:02:55] experience
[1:02:56] for
[1:02:57] truth to say that you know once upon a
[1:03:01] time things were absolutely
[1:03:04] wonderful and it's our duty to Proclaim
[1:03:06] that and it's important to do that amen
[1:03:09] because there's a Vindication behind it
[1:03:12] but it's not for the purpose of
[1:03:14] continually pointing
[1:03:15] backwards it's for promoting going
[1:03:19] forwards with that
[1:03:22] Spirit they are blindly going on
[1:03:25] preaching experence for
[1:03:27] truth may God have pity on them may
[1:03:30] their eyes be open before it's too late
[1:03:33] now brothers and sisters I'm not
[1:03:34] throwing off on anyone I want us all to
[1:03:38] get into Christ that's my desire just
[1:03:40] get the Holy Ghost in our lives and you
[1:03:43] know I I I saw a poster that I thought
[1:03:45] that it was really good not all people
[1:03:47] that were that are wandering that are
[1:03:49] Wanderers are lost it's a very true
[1:03:52] statement we can't put anybody in or put
[1:03:55] anybody out but if someone is actually
[1:03:57] preaching the word of God separately
[1:03:59] from what the word of God says then we
[1:04:01] can identify what that is it's a very
[1:04:04] important thing and you know what if we
[1:04:05] have a brother or a sister we need to be
[1:04:07] able to say brother or sister what
[1:04:09] you're saying isn't according to the
[1:04:11] word of God if he's a true brother or
[1:04:13] sister he'll say oh I'm sorry that I
[1:04:15] said it that way I never meant it that
[1:04:17] way I would always want to come in line
[1:04:18] with the word of
[1:04:20] God then get
[1:04:22] angry and say no no no no no no what I'm
[1:04:25] saying is is right I got a further
[1:04:26] Revelation there's no further Revelation
[1:04:28] than what the Vindicated Prophet for our
[1:04:30] age brought brothers and sisters every
[1:04:33] revelation will fall under that
[1:04:35] Revelation or it's a wrong
[1:04:39] Revelation he goes on to say oh listen
[1:04:42] to me when did The Prestige of money
[1:04:45] social leadership business ability or
[1:04:47] sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man
[1:04:51] for Spiritual leadership or give any
[1:04:53] weight to the word of God and when in
[1:04:57] any way
[1:04:58] materiality or human values begin to
[1:05:01] show as the media by which God works
[1:05:05] instead of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:08] alone then we are fighting against God
[1:05:12] and not for
[1:05:14] him now I want this on record right here
[1:05:16] I'm not speaking against the elders in
[1:05:18] the church no sir and that Elder can be
[1:05:22] as poor as any man was ever poor or be
[1:05:26] the richest man in the world as long as
[1:05:29] he is an elder in heart and
[1:05:33] deed that's why we can't just look at
[1:05:36] someone and judge them and I would
[1:05:38] recommend not looking at anybody and
[1:05:40] judging them let God judge them just
[1:05:43] love everyone and see what God will do
[1:05:46] he says I would not hesitate to ordain
[1:05:49] any man that has the real spiritual
[1:05:52] qualifications as an elder or Deacon
[1:05:55] regardless of his finances or social
[1:05:58] position but when you see a social or
[1:06:01] financial structure come into the church
[1:06:03] that divides the folks in any way that
[1:06:07] is not of God right it is another sign
[1:06:11] of the time in this physically rich but
[1:06:15] spiritually impoverished leodan age in
[1:06:18] which we are now
[1:06:20] living so he just takes it right out of
[1:06:23] the samni age and brings it right up to
[1:06:25] home right to the leoan age but it's
[1:06:28] beautiful because we're not in the leoan
[1:06:29] age we're in the bride age
[1:06:32] now oh my paragraph 80 I Know Thy
[1:06:36] poverty did you notice that their
[1:06:37] poverty is linked up with the synagogue
[1:06:40] of Satan in that same verse yes it is
[1:06:44] the rich powerful organization that has
[1:06:46] the wealth and always pushes out the
[1:06:48] little people that serve God when the
[1:06:51] spirit moves out in the hearts of men
[1:06:53] who is it that leaves the building on
[1:06:55] the property the little flock always
[1:06:58] loses out to the big organization and
[1:07:00] where do the people go then go they
[1:07:03] worship in homes old store buildings and
[1:07:05] basements just as they did when they
[1:07:07] went to the
[1:07:08] catacombs these people were poor in this
[1:07:12] world's good certainly but they were
[1:07:14] rich in spirit I know they're
[1:07:17] blasphemy now it isn't the thought here
[1:07:20] that these Liars were blaspheming God
[1:07:23] though that goes without saying
[1:07:26] but they are blaspheming the true
[1:07:29] church it is always thus the Jews of
[1:07:33] Jerusalem blasphemed the church at the
[1:07:36] beginning the Gentile polytheist did
[1:07:39] likewise if anyone is going to be evil
[1:07:41] spoken of it will always be the true
[1:07:44] seed Amen in Nero's Day the Christians
[1:07:47] were blamed for every
[1:07:49] Calamity even for the burning of Rome we
[1:07:53] heard that when we went through Rome we
[1:07:55] went through through the the Vatican
[1:07:57] City and uh did the tour and the guy
[1:08:00] that we were with were in a semi-private
[1:08:02] tour and he explained that in great
[1:08:04] detail how Nero watched the city burn
[1:08:07] and played his violin and was drunk and
[1:08:10] was just reviling in the moment and then
[1:08:12] what did he do he blamed the whole city
[1:08:14] burning on the Christians which caused
[1:08:16] everyone to be in an uproar and it
[1:08:18] persecuted the church hard after
[1:08:21] that in communist countries the little
[1:08:23] flock is always the first first to be
[1:08:26] exterminated though actually
[1:08:28] insignificant in size though the
[1:08:30] Christians are fine loyal people who do
[1:08:33] only good they will always be persecuted
[1:08:36] to the end that they might be physically
[1:08:40] destroyed the reason this is so is
[1:08:44] because they are a rebuke to the
[1:08:47] Godless like a sore thumb they stand out
[1:08:51] before the
[1:08:52] wicked and though the righteous intend
[1:08:54] no harm to the wicked Wicked but want to
[1:08:56] do only good invariably they find they
[1:08:59] are embroiled as was John the Baptist
[1:09:01] with Herod for John did not want to harm
[1:09:04] either Herod or his wife but to save
[1:09:07] them from the wrath of God right now I
[1:09:10] think it's important just to say that it
[1:09:12] doesn't give us license because we hear
[1:09:14] that to go and just point our finger in
[1:09:16] people's noses and say that you're a
[1:09:18] sinner you need to repent and try and
[1:09:19] belittle people belittling people will
[1:09:22] not attract them to the gospel yes sir
[1:09:25] in ourselves in piety will not attract
[1:09:28] people to the gospel but just living the
[1:09:31] life of Jesus Christ will attract the
[1:09:34] people's attention to our lives people
[1:09:37] will say oh I'm sorry for swearing we
[1:09:39] know we've said this many times sorry I
[1:09:40] swear I didn't mean to do that and
[1:09:42] you'll be like why why you saying sorry
[1:09:44] like what difference does it make to you
[1:09:46] and they'll say well there's something
[1:09:48] different about you yeah there is you
[1:09:50] don't even have to say a word and they
[1:09:51] know it the spirit inside of them is
[1:09:53] recognizing the spirit inside of you
[1:09:55] right it's because we're a rebuke to
[1:09:57] society people who are believers are a
[1:10:00] rebuke to the
[1:10:03] Godless uh this was not only thoroughly
[1:10:06] misunderstood and absolutely withstood
[1:10:08] but John was put to death because of
[1:10:11] it and for all the good the people of
[1:10:14] God do they are still put to public
[1:10:17] shame and to death surely there must be
[1:10:21] some Sinister force behind a people who
[1:10:23] would be so void of conscience that they
[1:10:26] would return evil to those who did good
[1:10:30] to them yes there is such a force it's
[1:10:33] Satan the answer lies in the next verse
[1:10:36] in Revelations 2:10 fear none of those
[1:10:39] things which Thou shalt suffer behold
[1:10:41] the devil shall cast some of you into
[1:10:44] prison that ye may be tried and ye shall
[1:10:47] have tribulation 10 days be thou
[1:10:50] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[1:10:53] a Crown of Life
[1:10:56] every time the Lord uses those words
[1:10:58] fear not there is an engagement at hand
[1:11:02] which will involve Great danger and
[1:11:04] suffering and
[1:11:06] deprivation now he does not say in a
[1:11:08] blunt Curt manner tribulation is coming
[1:11:11] that would frighten one but like a
[1:11:14] mother who is about to turn out the
[1:11:16] light says gently to her child lest he
[1:11:19] be frightened now don't be afraid for
[1:11:22] the light will go out and it will be
[1:11:24] dark but remember that I am here with
[1:11:27] you amen so he says don't be afraid of
[1:11:31] man or what he can do to you I am with
[1:11:34] you and my grace is sufficient for you
[1:11:38] amen when you pass through the waters
[1:11:41] they will not overflow you not even in
[1:11:44] death are you
[1:11:47] defeated you are more than conquerors
[1:11:49] the great Apostle Paul knew from
[1:11:51] experience the reality of those words
[1:11:54] and he wrote in Romans 8:35
[1:11:57] to39 who shall separate us from the love
[1:12:00] of Christ shall tribulation or distress
[1:12:03] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:12:07] Peril or sword for it is written for thy
[1:12:10] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:12:14] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:12:17] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:12:20] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:12:23] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:12:26] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:12:29] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:12:32] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:12:35] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:12:37] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:12:40] Jesus our
[1:12:42] lord I just think it's so beautiful I
[1:12:44] just want to encourage us tonight if you
[1:12:46] have the ability to hear what the spirit
[1:12:48] saith unto the church than this applies
[1:12:51] amen nothing absolutely nothing is going
[1:12:54] to be able to separate you from the love
[1:12:56] of God because you have his spirit in
[1:12:59] you and that's the reason why you can
[1:13:01] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:13:03] church it's such a consolation you know
[1:13:06] one day we're going to look back and
[1:13:07] think about all of the struggles and all
[1:13:09] of the trials remember brother brother
[1:13:12] Gary Walker when he was here and he said
[1:13:15] the words that he wanted to hear that
[1:13:17] that he believes we will hear that we'll
[1:13:20] say with our voice when we get over
[1:13:23] there we'll look at all of the struggles
[1:13:25] and all of the trials in our life and
[1:13:26] we'll say it was worth it all once we're
[1:13:29] over there just for one second it was
[1:13:32] worth it
[1:13:34] all he goes on in paragraph 85 here he
[1:13:37] says no we are not to fear his love
[1:13:41] casts out all fear so I just want to
[1:13:44] encourage us tonight brothers and
[1:13:45] sisters if we have
[1:13:46] fear there's a spirit that's attacking
[1:13:49] you and his love will cast out that fear
[1:13:53] sometimes we just need to actually
[1:13:55] confess that we're afraid we need to say
[1:13:58] those words the word says to confess
[1:13:59] your faults one to another that's why we
[1:14:01] have prayer meetings come to a prayer
[1:14:02] meeting we can pray one for another we
[1:14:04] can actually Express the desires the
[1:14:06] prayers that we have in our hearts and
[1:14:09] when our brothers and sisters hear it we
[1:14:10] can pray one for another and what does
[1:14:12] the word say then we'll be healed it's
[1:14:14] beautiful we don't have to fear his love
[1:14:17] casts out all fear now notice what he
[1:14:19] says the devil will cast some of you
[1:14:21] into prison that you might be tried the
[1:14:24] Jews were doing that right then the
[1:14:26] Pagan priests were doing that right then
[1:14:29] the governors who tried to Cur Curry
[1:14:32] favor with the public because the people
[1:14:34] liked the arena hurled the Christians by
[1:14:38] the thousands to their death destroying
[1:14:41] them by lions and
[1:14:43] Gladiators what has the devil to do with
[1:14:46] this why blame him ah yes but it is the
[1:14:50] devil's hatred behind it
[1:14:52] all he is behind it all for he hates
[1:14:57] God and what God has set his heart on
[1:15:01] Satan is bound to try and Destroy but
[1:15:04] watch here is some
[1:15:06] illumination if Satan is behind the Jews
[1:15:10] who are hailing Christians into court
[1:15:13] then the Jews are not of God's religion
[1:15:15] but the
[1:15:16] Devils that's sharp their Gathering is
[1:15:20] also of the synagogue of Satan and if
[1:15:23] the Roman Catholic Church killed the
[1:15:25] multitudes of Believers in the Dark Ages
[1:15:28] yes and in all
[1:15:30] ages then they are of the devil and
[1:15:33] belong to Satan
[1:15:35] also and if you think this is shocking
[1:15:38] just wait until the prophecy of
[1:15:39] Revelations 13 is fulfilled it is
[1:15:42] strikingly true that the United States
[1:15:45] of America is in that chapter the very
[1:15:48] number 13 is a symbol of this nation it
[1:15:52] started with 13 colonies it's flagged
[1:15:55] has 13 stars and 13
[1:15:58] stripes and there is her Destiny in the
[1:16:01] 13th
[1:16:04] chapter and I think it's interesting too
[1:16:06] I could be wrong with this um but just
[1:16:08] to throw it out there how many provinces
[1:16:11] and territories are there in
[1:16:13] Canada I believe there's the same
[1:16:16] number in this image that is mentioned
[1:16:20] in this chapter will be found all the
[1:16:22] wickedness of the Beast that was before
[1:16:24] for it as the Beast Rose at the Ning
[1:16:28] Council so the image will come out of
[1:16:30] the World Council of churches with all
[1:16:33] ungodly and satanic power to vent the
[1:16:36] anger of the devil upon the True Vine of
[1:16:38] God it will be a Repeat Performance of
[1:16:41] all diabolical cunning and
[1:16:45] cruelty those who fight the humble of
[1:16:48] God and scoff and Destroy let them do
[1:16:52] it and do it they will and all in the
[1:16:56] name of God and religion but they lie
[1:16:59] right they are not of God they are of
[1:17:03] their father the devil they by their
[1:17:07] deeds against any
[1:17:09] people expose themselves for what they
[1:17:13] are Cain exposed exactly who he was by
[1:17:18] the nature that he expressed and it's no
[1:17:21] different for us brothers and sisters
[1:17:23] today the nature that we express we said
[1:17:26] it on Sunday just put a little pressure
[1:17:27] just see what happens add some pressure
[1:17:30] and you'll see who's on the inside
[1:17:32] they'll come
[1:17:33] out brother Ram says let them organize
[1:17:36] and repudiate the little
[1:17:39] flock they but further reveal to all
[1:17:43] that they are of the devil they are the
[1:17:46] false Vine the vine that murders their
[1:17:49] hatred proves who they are the nickan
[1:17:53] Antichrist Church
[1:17:55] is who they
[1:17:56] are they shall be cast into prison yes
[1:17:59] they that hailed into court and falsely
[1:18:02] accused and tried and imprisoned and of
[1:18:04] course it is all done in the name of
[1:18:06] religion and decency and
[1:18:09] outraged
[1:18:11] innocency I all done for a good
[1:18:14] cause he says that makes me think of the
[1:18:17] Supreme Court's ruling on prayer and
[1:18:20] Bible reading in the schools who is
[1:18:23] behind it Satan is it's just another
[1:18:28] angry Outburst against
[1:18:32] God Thou shalt have tribulation 10 days
[1:18:35] here is a
[1:18:36] prophecy and with it is a means of
[1:18:39] determining the lifespan of the saman
[1:18:45] age di Dian the cruelest of all Emperors
[1:18:50] launched a terror campaign against the
[1:18:52] Saints of God that except for the mercy
[1:18:55] of God would have wiped out all
[1:18:58] believers it was the bloodiest in
[1:19:00] history and lasted 10 years the 10 days
[1:19:03] of Revelations
[1:19:06] 210b from 302 to
[1:19:10] 3:12 be thou faithful unto death he does
[1:19:14] not say be faithful unto
[1:19:17] death until death but unto death you may
[1:19:21] have to seal your testimony with your
[1:19:23] blood
[1:19:25] thousands yay Millions have died during
[1:19:28] all the ages they died in the faith like
[1:19:31] Antipas the faithful martyr they held
[1:19:35] not their
[1:19:36] lives dear unto death often we think
[1:19:40] that it would be almost impossible to be
[1:19:42] a martyr but dare to recall the faith
[1:19:46] that we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[1:19:49] is the same faith that upholds the
[1:19:52] polycarp and all martyrs the Supreme
[1:19:55] faith will give us Supreme Grace for the
[1:19:58] Supreme hour amen blessed be God
[1:20:02] forever I think it's so beautiful
[1:20:04] brothers and sisters there is coming a
[1:20:06] day however when that Grace is Gone when
[1:20:08] that Grace lifts off and then people
[1:20:11] will actually give their own lives with
[1:20:15] without that anointing and it will not
[1:20:16] be
[1:20:18] pretty but that's why we get the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost that's why we keep preaching get
[1:20:21] the Holy Ghost while we can he's here we
[1:20:24] just have to get the Holy Ghost and I
[1:20:27] will give thee a crown of life since not
[1:20:29] even a cup of cold water given in the
[1:20:32] name of the Lord fails to receive a
[1:20:35] reward how great shall the reward to him
[1:20:39] how great shall be the reward to him who
[1:20:42] gives his life as a martyr for the name
[1:20:46] of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can get a
[1:20:49] small idea if we compare this crown with
[1:20:51] the crown one in a race 1 Corinthians 9
[1:20:54] 9
[1:20:55] 24 know ye not that they which run in a
[1:21:00] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[1:21:04] so run that ye may
[1:21:07] obtain a crown given to the winner of
[1:21:10] the Olympic race was a Garland of olive
[1:21:13] branches but the crown spoken of here in
[1:21:16] Revelation given to a martyr is the
[1:21:18] crown of
[1:21:20] royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life
[1:21:23] The One Crown
[1:21:25] is for those who have
[1:21:28] striven the other is for those who have
[1:21:31] given both crowns are Incorruptible they
[1:21:35] will not perish the winners of the
[1:21:38] worldly race of life will soon lose the
[1:21:41] joy of the plotts of the
[1:21:44] world their Glory will
[1:21:47] fail but those who give their lives for
[1:21:50] God either by daily striving or shedding
[1:21:55] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[1:21:57] their lives will be given the Crown of
[1:22:01] Life we know that the world has a saying
[1:22:04] that says he who dies with the most toys
[1:22:07] wins if we're worrying about this world
[1:22:10] about achievements about all of the
[1:22:12] successes that we can get in this world
[1:22:14] and putting Christ to be second and
[1:22:16] third on our list of priorities then
[1:22:18] we're going to fulfill that first part
[1:22:20] but if we are striving to actually
[1:22:22] submit ourselves therefore unto God
[1:22:25] every single day brothers and sisters
[1:22:27] there is a crown of life waiting for
[1:22:29] each one of
[1:22:30] us paragraph 93 all too little time is
[1:22:33] spent on laboring for the Eternal
[1:22:35] rewards of God the recompense of God is
[1:22:38] too lightly esteemed if we believe in
[1:22:41] the reality of the resurrection of the
[1:22:43] body and have an eternal Kingdom of
[1:22:46] substance then we ought to lay up in
[1:22:49] heaven those good Treasures that are
[1:22:53] available to the faithful
[1:22:55] Saints and we know that the word of God
[1:22:57] says to lay up Treasures in Heaven amen
[1:23:00] where neither moth nor rust can corrupt
[1:23:03] nothing Earthly can get through neither
[1:23:05] can thieves break through and steal
[1:23:08] those those Treasures are laid up in
[1:23:09] heaven reserved undefiled for us in our
[1:23:13] own names and I think it's so beautiful
[1:23:16] because it starts with our ability to
[1:23:17] hear the word but then one day there's
[1:23:19] going to be that that great long
[1:23:22] gigantic enormous marriage supper table
[1:23:25] and there's going to be a place setting
[1:23:27] with each and every one of our names and
[1:23:29] nobody can change that all of the all of
[1:23:33] the reward will be there it'll start and
[1:23:35] it'll just be a wonderful time won't it
[1:23:38] the reward for overcoming Revelations 2
[1:23:40] verse 11 he that hath an ear let him
[1:23:42] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:23:44] churches he that overcometh shall not be
[1:23:47] hurt of the second
[1:23:49] death now once again the spirit is
[1:23:52] talking to all ages
[1:23:56] this message is to comfort us today even
[1:24:00] as it has comforted our Brethren over
[1:24:02] all the ages I think it's just so
[1:24:04] beautiful how brother Bram continually
[1:24:06] brings this out that the the words that
[1:24:08] we're reading about the church ages
[1:24:10] that's not just exclusive to that age
[1:24:13] it's about every age and he says to us
[1:24:16] that the second death will not hurt us
[1:24:19] we all know that the second death is the
[1:24:21] Lake of Fire Revelations 20:14
[1:24:24] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:24:27] Lake of Fire this is the second death I
[1:24:30] think this is a beautiful part brothers
[1:24:33] and sisters where he goes into a real
[1:24:35] detailed explanation we're going to do
[1:24:37] it about how there is no Eternal death
[1:24:41] there's only eternal life amen there's
[1:24:44] only one form of Eternal and that is
[1:24:46] Zoey God's own life brother bam goes on
[1:24:50] to say in paragraph 95 of course that
[1:24:53] means that all those
[1:24:54] who were therein were cast into the Lake
[1:24:58] of Fire now then I want to bring out
[1:25:00] something here for
[1:25:02] you it no doubt will cause some people
[1:25:04] to comment on my strange
[1:25:08] Doctrine no doubt but I stand here on
[1:25:11] the authority of the word of God and
[1:25:14] deny that the unbeliever goes to an
[1:25:17] eternal hell and burns there
[1:25:21] eternally in the first place hell or the
[1:25:24] Lake of Fire or whatever you want to
[1:25:27] call it is not
[1:25:30] Eternal and I think it's beautiful I'm
[1:25:32] just going to pause there and say it
[1:25:33] because it doesn't say Eternal in the
[1:25:35] word of God does it there's no word that
[1:25:39] says Eternal linked to hell or the Lake
[1:25:42] of
[1:25:43] Fire how can it be if it had a beginning
[1:25:47] in Matthew 25:41 it says that
[1:25:51] Everlasting the key word Everlasting
[1:25:54] fire was prepared for the devil and his
[1:25:56] angels now if it was prepared then it
[1:25:59] wasn't without a beginning if it had a
[1:26:02] beginning then it can't be Eternal of
[1:26:06] course you might stumble over the idea
[1:26:08] of the word
[1:26:09] Everlasting but that word means from
[1:26:11] ages to the ages and has different
[1:26:14] meanings attached to it in 1st Samuel
[1:26:17] 3:13-14 God told Samuel that he was
[1:26:20] going to judge the house of Eli forever
[1:26:23] and that they would offer no more
[1:26:25] sacrifices forever as his priests and in
[1:26:29] First Kings
[1:26:30] 2:27 Solomon thrust out the last
[1:26:34] descendants of Eli from the priesthood
[1:26:37] that was four generations or so later
[1:26:40] now you can see that Everlasting does
[1:26:43] not compare with what is
[1:26:46] eternal or that which had no beginning
[1:26:49] or
[1:26:50] end here in this case the word
[1:26:54] Everlasting means to the vanishing point
[1:26:58] that is what happened they vanished look
[1:27:01] at the word destruction over in 2
[1:27:03] Thessalonians
[1:27:05] 1:19 who shall be punished with
[1:27:07] Everlasting destruction in the Greek
[1:27:10] destruction positively means
[1:27:14] Annihilation and the word destruction
[1:27:16] does not mean destroying the words have
[1:27:19] meanings brothers and sisters now
[1:27:22] destroying means something going on and
[1:27:25] in Decay so what can Everlasting
[1:27:28] annihilation mean it doesn't mean to
[1:27:31] keep on annihilating or that would make
[1:27:34] the word destroying instead of
[1:27:37] Destruction it means to destroy to the
[1:27:40] ending point end
[1:27:44] it you might wonder now when you can use
[1:27:48] that word
[1:27:49] Eternal and not use it the way we have
[1:27:52] been taught that is easy when it applies
[1:27:56] to God it means to be without beginning
[1:27:59] or end and ever enduring and never
[1:28:02] ceasing and when you talk of eternal
[1:28:05] life you have that in mind which is the
[1:28:08] life of God Amen 1 John
[1:28:12] 51-12 this is the record that God has
[1:28:14] given us eternal life and that life is
[1:28:18] in his son he that hath the son hath
[1:28:23] life that's why we can't go about taking
[1:28:26] Jesus and saying that he wasn't God soon
[1:28:29] as we start doing that we don't have the
[1:28:31] son paragraph 99 now then only sons of
[1:28:35] God have life eternal the kind that
[1:28:39] never had a beginning but always was
[1:28:43] that is right if you have something in
[1:28:45] you you have something in you right now
[1:28:48] that is eternal without beginning or end
[1:28:51] it is the spirit of God it is a part of
[1:28:54] God himself it is the life of God am so
[1:29:01] beautiful now if a sinner is going to
[1:29:03] hell and then suffer the same as you
[1:29:07] were going to heaven and enjoy heaven
[1:29:10] then he has the same kind of life you
[1:29:14] have
[1:29:15] already doesn't that just make sense
[1:29:18] right yeah well then there might be
[1:29:21] those who say eternal life signifies the
[1:29:25] welfare of the children of God it is
[1:29:28] their welfare and enjoyment that is ex
[1:29:31] it that is at stake on the other hand
[1:29:34] The Sinner goes on to his punishment so
[1:29:37] that we can reduce the second death to a
[1:29:41] matter of punishment and
[1:29:44] place eternal life means heaven and
[1:29:48] eternal punishment means
[1:29:52] hell he says you would be surprised
[1:29:54] surprised at the men who have been
[1:29:56] exalted as theologians that believe that
[1:30:00] but do you know what that
[1:30:02] does it makes eternal life a matter of
[1:30:06] geography instead of a
[1:30:10] person it makes eternal life a matter of
[1:30:14] geography instead of a
[1:30:17] person eternal life is God the Lord
[1:30:20] Jesus
[1:30:22] Christ how anyone could believe believe
[1:30:24] such a thing that eternal life is a
[1:30:26] matter of place is more than I know it
[1:30:29] makes me stagger to think of it brothers
[1:30:32] and sisters I want to say it this way
[1:30:33] people believe that because of
[1:30:37] tradition teaching for tradition the
[1:30:40] doctrines of men yes that's what it is
[1:30:44] but it is staggering to think about once
[1:30:46] you have actually been able to hear
[1:30:48] about the
[1:30:49] truth but you know this is some of the
[1:30:51] stuff that I had to fight through when I
[1:30:52] came around to the message of the hour I
[1:30:54] had to think my goodness I didn't even
[1:30:56] think that I had ever thought about hell
[1:30:58] being Eternal or or or Eternal
[1:31:01] punishment I always thought Everlasting
[1:31:03] and eternal were the same but they're
[1:31:04] not but they're taught to be
[1:31:07] interchangeable the words have meaning
[1:31:09] and they're a very important
[1:31:12] thing paragraph 102 no sir there is only
[1:31:16] one kind of eternal life God has it if
[1:31:18] we have God we have eternal life in and
[1:31:22] through him
[1:31:25] so beautiful so you see that word
[1:31:28] Eternal or Everlasting can be applied in
[1:31:31] various ways but when it applies to God
[1:31:34] he being what he is it has one meaning
[1:31:39] it is the duration of God you can't
[1:31:42] apply it like that to any other thing
[1:31:45] isn't that beautiful you could just
[1:31:47] totally eliminate every other thing and
[1:31:48] just say it only applies to God Eternal
[1:31:51] only applies to God God is the only
[1:31:52] eternal
[1:31:54] my God Alone is eternal and because he
[1:31:58] lives we live with him sorry this just
[1:32:02] makes me want to preach once I get into
[1:32:04] this like this it's so good amen so rich
[1:32:07] paragraph 104 now don't let anyone say
[1:32:09] that I don't believe in a lake of fire
[1:32:12] and in punishment I do and I I'll tell
[1:32:15] you my own perspective is you know the
[1:32:17] devil will say well if there's no
[1:32:19] eternal hell then you could sin
[1:32:22] potentially and just be in annihilated
[1:32:24] you just live your life eat drink and be
[1:32:26] merry and then potentially you go get
[1:32:27] punished for a little while and then you
[1:32:28] just annihilate it it's over you're gone
[1:32:31] right listen to what he says here now
[1:32:34] don't let anyone tell you I don't
[1:32:35] believe in a lake of fire and in
[1:32:37] punishment I do I don't know how long it
[1:32:39] will last but it will eventually be
[1:32:41] removed in Revelations 21:8 it says that
[1:32:44] those Sinners mentioned will have their
[1:32:46] part in the Lake of Fire but the true
[1:32:49] interpretation of the word is not part
[1:32:53] but it is time they will have their time
[1:32:55] in the Lake of Fire see there you have
[1:32:58] it so the wicked shall be cast into hell
[1:33:00] Hades or the grave and Hell into the
[1:33:03] Lake of Fire separated from God what a
[1:33:06] terrible thing that will be it will be
[1:33:09] just can't even imagine it but with the
[1:33:12] righteous it shall not be so they don't
[1:33:15] have to fear they have been redeemed by
[1:33:18] God they are in his bosom they are the
[1:33:21] Overcomers and who is he that
[1:33:25] overcometh he that believeth that Jesus
[1:33:28] is the Christ am Hallelujah why will
[1:33:31] this Overcomer this believer escape and
[1:33:34] go into the Realms of eternal life and
[1:33:37] Bliss because Jesus isn't this beautiful
[1:33:40] God came in Jesus and paid a price to
[1:33:45] Ransom us from
[1:33:46] sin he filled the gap of separation and
[1:33:50] we who were a far off are now made nigh
[1:33:53] by by the blood Oh
[1:33:56] my he did
[1:33:58] it we can't do it we can only accept
[1:34:01] that he did it and if we're willing to
[1:34:03] accept it on the basis that he presents
[1:34:06] it then he did it
[1:34:09] amen and they will never come into
[1:34:12] condemnation they will never be in that
[1:34:15] Lake of Fire they can never be lost for
[1:34:19] he will lose none of them not one of the
[1:34:22] redeemed will be anywhere except where
[1:34:26] Jesus is not even where brother Bram is
[1:34:29] right now when he was over on on this
[1:34:33] side and he went beyond the curtain of
[1:34:34] time and he said to them I want to see
[1:34:36] Jesus and they said you can't see him
[1:34:39] now it's not like that my oh my when
[1:34:43] that day comes brothers and sisters not
[1:34:44] one of their redeemed will be anywhere
[1:34:47] except where Jesus is and I just think
[1:34:49] it's beautiful because we could even go
[1:34:50] so far as to say it this way this is
[1:34:52] where it gets a little bit weird but you
[1:34:54] know it's not weird to the believer
[1:34:55] because anywhere the believer is today
[1:34:58] is where Jesus is
[1:35:00] am and that's just a
[1:35:03] fact paragraph 109 do you believe do you
[1:35:06] know why that is I will illustrate it
[1:35:08] for you I have a little boy Joseph he is
[1:35:12] a part of me no matter what happens if I
[1:35:14] Were a Rich Man the most I could do
[1:35:18] would be to disinherit him the worst
[1:35:22] sorry the worst I could do would be to
[1:35:24] disinherit him but there is nothing that
[1:35:27] I can ever do to deny him I can't
[1:35:30] because he's a part of me here let's
[1:35:33] take a blood test let's match his blood
[1:35:36] with mine it'll prove that Joseph is my
[1:35:40] son he is mine it's the blood test that
[1:35:43] shows whether you belong to God or not
[1:35:47] and like we've said brothers and sisters
[1:35:49] I just can't get this out of my my mind
[1:35:52] just like out of the token brother
[1:35:53] preaches it it's not the chemical blood
[1:35:56] it's not the substance of the blood it's
[1:35:59] not just speaking the blood it's living
[1:36:02] the blood it's letting that life of the
[1:36:05] blood come forward in our lives brother
[1:36:08] Bram goes on to say I can't help
[1:36:09] thinking of the time that I used to ride
[1:36:12] Herd on I used to ride Herd on purebred
[1:36:16] herfords in Colorado we used to have to
[1:36:18] bring those cattle for government
[1:36:20] inspection if we wanted to feed them on
[1:36:22] the government range
[1:36:24] but they would not allow one single
[1:36:25] animal that did not have the blood tag
[1:36:28] on the ear the tag signified that it was
[1:36:32] pure bread the Rangers looked them
[1:36:36] over the Rangers that looked them over
[1:36:39] did not look at the brand they just
[1:36:41] looked at the tag to see that the blood
[1:36:44] was the blood was the right blood
[1:36:47] Hallelujah if it's the right blood it's
[1:36:50] got to be right amen you know God looked
[1:36:54] down and declared the soul that sinth
[1:36:57] shall die it is separated from me it
[1:37:01] can't approach unto me we know that all
[1:37:04] have sinned and fallen short of the
[1:37:07] glory of God that meant that all died
[1:37:09] all were separated and one day a time
[1:37:13] would come when even that bit of life
[1:37:18] would be snuffed out and it would be all
[1:37:20] over but God In Love
[1:37:24] took an animal and took its life in the
[1:37:27] place of the sinner's life amen and we
[1:37:30] know brothers and sisters that that
[1:37:32] started in the Garden of Eden when Adam
[1:37:35] and Eve disbelieved the word of God Adam
[1:37:38] followed his wife's disbelief she was
[1:37:41] deceived he followed her God handed out
[1:37:44] the curses and he banished them from the
[1:37:47] garden banished them from the tree of
[1:37:49] life because they chose to feed on the
[1:37:52] tree of knowledge of good and evil we
[1:37:53] know the trees one was God one was Jesus
[1:37:56] one was the devil they were all there in
[1:37:57] the garden trees were people but here we
[1:38:01] have the situation what did God do he
[1:38:04] took them and showed them there is going
[1:38:05] to be a covering for you and it's not
[1:38:07] going to be your religious covering that
[1:38:08] you think that you have the leaves that
[1:38:11] they took and covered themselves with he
[1:38:13] said it's going to be an animal covering
[1:38:15] and he took and slew the first sacrifice
[1:38:18] himself and WRA them with those skins
[1:38:21] and we know the prophet of God talked
[1:38:23] about how it must have been for them
[1:38:24] walking out of the garden those first
[1:38:27] steps marching out of the garden with
[1:38:28] the wet bloody hides of those skins
[1:38:31] slapping against their thighs as they
[1:38:33] walked out knowing that every single
[1:38:35] time they have transgressed the laws of
[1:38:38] God now they have to rely on the
[1:38:41] sacrifice of an animal and we know that
[1:38:43] all the way down through the Old
[1:38:44] Testament that sacrifice happened and
[1:38:47] that's what the temple was actually
[1:38:49] built for that brother Nester was
[1:38:50] preaching on we're going to get into
[1:38:52] that but not tonight night it just it's
[1:38:54] so amazing to look at it but God In Love
[1:38:57] took an animal and took its life in the
[1:38:59] place of the sinner's life amen I'll
[1:39:02] call the musicians as we close
[1:39:05] here paragraph
[1:39:07] 112 we'll pick up from here next week
[1:39:11] Lord
[1:39:13] willing
[1:39:16] amen paragraph 112 in the Old Testament
[1:39:18] The Sinner brought a
[1:39:21] lamb he placed his hand on the lamb
[1:39:24] while the priest cut the Lamb's
[1:39:28] throat he felt the
[1:39:30] bleeding and heard the
[1:39:33] bleeding he he felt the
[1:39:36] bleeding and he heard the
[1:39:40] bleeding the animal crying for his life
[1:39:45] as it fell out of him he felt the body
[1:39:48] stiffen in
[1:39:50] death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled
[1:39:53] blood Ascend to God he knew that the
[1:39:58] lamb had taken his place but he knew
[1:40:03] that that Lamb's life had been forfeited
[1:40:05] for his amen but the life of that lamb
[1:40:09] was an animal life and it could not come
[1:40:12] back on the sinner making him clean so
[1:40:16] he
[1:40:16] left with the same desire to
[1:40:20] sin he would go out with sin in his mind
[1:40:23] and come back and offer a sacrifice for
[1:40:26] the same
[1:40:28] thing a year later stand with me tonight
[1:40:31] as we
[1:40:33] close but the New
[1:40:36] Testament in the New Testament it is not
[1:40:39] so our dying lamb is the Son of God who
[1:40:42] gave his blood a ransom for
[1:40:45] many by faith we walk up and place our
[1:40:48] hands upon that lamb we see him with the
[1:40:52] bloody
[1:40:53] wounds the lacerated back the cruel
[1:40:58] Thorns tearing his
[1:41:01] brow we feel his pain and hear him cry
[1:41:06] my God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:41:10] me and what
[1:41:12] happened the life that left that broken
[1:41:15] blood
[1:41:16] cell came back upon the repentant
[1:41:19] one the life that was in him
[1:41:23] came back upon
[1:41:26] us and we go back with no more desire to
[1:41:30] sin and we now possess a hatred for the
[1:41:34] works and lust of the
[1:41:38] flesh let's just bow in
[1:41:40] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just are
[1:41:43] so thankful for your gift of love that
[1:41:47] you gave us Lord so many people had to
[1:41:50] live under the animal sacrifice
[1:41:54] throughout so many ages
[1:41:56] Lord and father tonight we can read
[1:42:00] these words and recognize that you came
[1:42:04] and You Paid It All once and for
[1:42:07] all and then you sat down on the right
[1:42:12] hand of the Majesty on
[1:42:15] high and you did it for our sake Lord
[1:42:18] amen you did it so that we wouldn't even
[1:42:21] have to try and do anything the only
[1:42:23] thing that we have to do in the day in
[1:42:25] which we live is just believe help us
[1:42:28] Lord father we believe but help thou our
[1:42:31] unbelief father Lord Jesus help us to

[1:42:46] take the free gift that you've offered
[1:42:48] us and Run Run To You Lord we love you
[1:42:51] and we thank you Father for this life
[1:42:53] that you've given us through your own
[1:42:55] blood that you shed for us at Calvary

[1:43:00] witness to this dying world all around
[1:43:02] us father be with those who couldn't be
[1:43:04] here tonight Lord wherever they are
[1:43:07] whatever they're doing father we pray
[1:43:08] that you would just restore their
[1:43:10] strength father that you would just lift
[1:43:13] them up on the wings of an eagle father
