his name one more time knowing that we haven't gathered together just with one another but we've gathered together with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and that in itself is very humbling amen we just have a couple of requests we'd like to bring before our Lord Brother Steven DS has a request he's sick in his body at home tonight sister Stella has a request for her sister Julian I believe that's how you pronounce it we have a couple of unspoken requests and if you have a need tonight just defy gravity and make it known unto him as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity Lord we don't take it lightly Lord we know that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Our Lives can change father and we know that one way or another that is the promise for us father and we thank you for that Lord Jesus we know that your arm is not too short we know that there's no problem there's no trial there's no tribulation That's too great for you Lord Jesus and father we know that we're given these trials and tribulations in this life father so that we can trust you more that we can trust you greater father we just ask that you would help us Lord Jesus to trust you more and father to trust you greater Lord Jesus not to look at the circumstances not to look at our past not to run all of the events going on in our lives through the things that have happened in the past Lord where scars have taken place oh Father where people have hurt us Lord Jesus where Ministry has let us down but father we pray that we could look to you father that you could take us by the hand and lift us up Lord Jesus just like Peter that night in the water in the stormy seas father oh Father we believe but help thou our unbelief Lord Jesus we just invite you father to take us a little higher in your word tonight father Lord Jesus we just want to remember each and every request that was made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand father we know that you're able and we just commit the needs unto you now father we pray for the unspoken requests Lord Jesus you know them and we just commit them into your hands father we thank you for meeting those needs Sly Lord Jesus father we just want to remember Sister Stella's sister Julian Lord that you would touch her father who is sick in her body Lord we want to remember brother Steven DS father that you would touch him in his body Lord Jesus we know that his desire is to be here tonight and father we pray that you would just be with him at home and father for each and every one maybe who had a request that just didn't make it known father that Lord they just didn't father reach out to touch you tonight father we we pray that somehow some way you would meet those needs amen father we love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians appreciate your unfailing service to the body if you have your Bibles tonight if you could turn with me to Revelations chapter two we will continue on our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages we'll uh pick up from where we left off last time amen I'll start reading with uh Revelations verse chapter 2 verse chapter 2 verse 12 Revelations chapter 2 verse 12 I guess I just get up here and get a little bit excited and start to stumble over my words and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of baalam who taught balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth it saving he that receiveth it let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we just thank you for your word Lord we thank you for your many promises unto us father we thank you for sending us a prophet in the age in which we live Lord father that we would have ears to hear what that Prophet had to say knowing that it wasn't his words but it was yours it was that sharp sword with two edges father and we just thank you for the ability to hear that word father tonight we pray that your spirit would just Quicken the word as we read it tonight father to our very Souls that when we leave this building we would say truly we've heard from you tonight amen we love you and we thank you we just commit each life and each word that's spoken now unto you father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be in the house of the Lord as we've mentioned just like to welcome the dolls God richly bless you I guess they have a a wedding in Canmore on the weekend and they've come to fellowship and service tonight it's certainly wonderful to see everyone's face we've been away and before we went away others were away and we're getting back together again it's just so wonderful and uh we're certainly thankful for what the Lord's doing in our day we uh just have a few announcements before we pick up where we left off um just like to say thank you brother Joshua I just want to call you josou that's what I've known you as all along but uh certainly thankful for the service on Sunday we know the Lord really blessed us with the word that he gave brother Joshua and uh you know it's just a wonderful thing to see the the spirit move in the body amen just uh want to remember we have brother TOS odoo here on the 8th of September we're certainly looking forward to hear what the Lord's put on his heart and uh remember he goes back September 11th so we want to make sure we reach out and get in a bit of fellowship before they go back certainly been uh wonderful to to see both brother to and Sister Janet together and uh just to see the the parents that raised the the sons to have the families that they have that just want to serve the Lord amen just want to put their shoulder to the wheel there's something about that we know that children are the heritage and uh you know that's the lasting impression that we're going to have on this Earth we can have great businesses and we could be politicians we could have all manner of things in this life and be known for a few different things but really the people that we raise will be what we're actually known for the most and uh we know that's our heritage in heaven so to be able to see our children and our children's children that is the promise of the word and what a blessing that is so God richly bless you brother TOs and uh Sister Janet for your efforts we have uh September youth service coming up on the 15th that's going to take place at our house brother Joel and Sister Crystal uh will not be able to take it this month so uh we have stepped in and we're happy to do it uh so that'll be at our place after service on the 15th uh on the 22nd we will have a 6 PM communion service it's been a while since we've had communion we kind of took the summer off and it's going to be wonderful to get back in into the house of the Lord and just commit Our Lives to the Lord once again there's something special that happens at a communion foot washing and we know it's not about form and it's not about tradition it's about recognizing that we are Discerning the Lord's body not our own and that's what happens when we wash one another's feet that's what happens when we take the bread and the wine it's a wonderful time so um we'll have this all on the website calendar the 22nd of September on October 4th 5th and 6th we have something a little um out of the ordinary happening but we just felt led to pursue this and have had this on the heart for quite some time time we have an over 25 singles in Brackets unmarried Fellowship weekend at our at our place we're we're creating a venue just for folks to come and and have some fellowship that they ordinarily wouldn't have the opportunity to have and uh so we've advertised it with many different churches and there's a bunch of people that seem to be interested so we're going to see what the Lord will do that weekend uh there's a few things that are going to take place but uh we can talk more about that in the future so we have that happening as well um we were away last weekend at the Moose Lake Camp and uh it was sure a nice time it was not a busy church service camp it was a family camp where we had a bit of church service we had a bit of learning and we had lots and lots of fellowship and it was just a wonderful time there was such a a nice mix of people that were there and uh you know Saturday night we didn't have a service they kept it open and all the the main event was fellowship and the young people they wanted to play volleyball so they had a really good volleyball net they had a really good place to do it and they played volleyball for hours and you know it was wonderful to just sit back and watch this happen as we were having Fellowship they played till they couldn't see the ball anymore and uh but to stand back and look at it and think this is the future of our children they're fellowshipping with other believers and unless we as parents create that opportunity for them they're going to find their own opportunities and I'm not saying that camp is the camp I'm saying any Camp any kind of Fellowship that you can put your children in for Fellowship is a wonderful thing and and I was thinking about it after I do apologize because I did not advertise this with our congregation but I am going to next year we will certainly make sure everyone is aware of it if you have children if they're even very young children they don't have to be old children you can go to camp you don't even have to have children and you can go to Camp there was folks there that were they they they have children but they're grown up and gone away and uh it was just a wonderful time really really interesting time and and the cross-section of people that were there uh you might wonder why I'm going on about this it's just important I believe it's a very important thing to recognize it's important for our children to meet other believing children and unless we create the atmosphere it's not going to happen the way that maybe we think so we uh we just want to encourage that and uh we had just a wonderful time with Brother Steve Brant from Quebec he took the uh the services and uh yeah it was just a great time so that's all for Talking Now Let's get into the word we're going to pick up with the exposition of the seven Church ages where we left off last time and uh that was paragraph 168 I thought this was real interesting we have reached um in one two actually four more pages when I get to 218 it's exactly the middle of this book I'm reading from from the red exposition of the seven Church ages but we're almost in the middle and this is number 37 uh service number 37 of this so and I I believe this is just skipping across the surface too there's so much in here that we could really dwell on but uh we'll just we'll just carry on here in paragraph 168 brother Bram actually I'm going to go back to 167 the brandom says people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors papal false Christian Rome she is even called The Eternal City how blasphemous Now controls by religion even more ably than when Pagan Imperial R controlled by the pure iron of force so I just wanted to lay that out because we're going to really go into where they actually started to to force people to worship to force people to get on board with the religion of the day brother R goes on to say in 168 Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and back the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome you can see this is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture once the Nan Council had swung the power of political Rome to the church it seemed that there were no limits to which this first Christian Church would go the name Christian which originally brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors what a flip that is what a change it was in this age he says that a agustine of Hippo 354 to 430 set forth the precept that the church ought and must use Force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that if necessary sorry if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that it was in harmony with the word of God to kill the Heretics and the apostates where do they get that from John 16 John 16 says these things verse one of John 16 these things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended that they shall put you out of the synagogues the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God of service how you can just take a scripture right the devil will use scripture we know that he goes on to say and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me now I want to just point that out remember the word known in the Bible typically is not the way that we would say the word known typically it denotes an intimate relation amen these people have not had an intimate relation with the father and you know neither can they have because we know that Jesus said to him you are of your father the devil oh my and his works you do and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me because if you knew the father you would know me is really what he said um I'm just paraphrasing throwing that out there verse four says but these things have I I told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them here we have this guy Austine of Hippo saying You must use force and you know what if they won't listen then just kill them just knock them off just get him out of the way send them send them to God right terrible goes on to say in his controversy with the donatists he wrote it is indeed better that men should be led to worship by God by teaching than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected for many have found Advantage have we as we have proved and are daily proving by actual experience the works right in being first compelled by fear or pain so that they might afterwards be influen by teaching so that they might follow out in act what they have already learned in word whilst these are better who are guided a right by love love that corrects say those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear for who can possibly love us more than Christ who laid down his life for the Sheep yet after calling Peter and the other Apostles by his words alone when he came to summon Paul he not only constrained him with his voice but he even dashed him to the Earth with his power and that he might forcibly bring one who is Raging amidst the darkness of infidelity to to desire the light of the heart he first struck him with physical blindness of the eyes why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost Sons to return because if we don't actually follow the word of the day then we're considered to be a heretic and an apostate why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost Sons to turn the Lord himself said go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in wherefore if the power which the church has received by Divine appointment and where did that Divine appointment come from Constantine right bringing the church and state together by Divine appointment in its due season though the religious character and Faith Of Kings be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges that is in heresies and schisms are compelled to come in then let them not find fault with being compelled just make it fine we can constrain them by force to come in my paragraph 171 The Thirst for blood was growing a pace the false Vine in Spain now played upon the emperor Maximus to join in the attack upon the true believers who had the word and and the signs and wonders with them thus the Pilan ists were brought to treves by Bishop ithacus in 358 he accused them of Witchcraft and immorality and many were executed Martin of Tours and Ambrose of Milan protested this and pleaded in vain for the persecution to cease when the persecution was prolonged these two Bishops refused to fellowship with bishop hius and others like him him strange to say the sinod in trees approved of the murders from this time on especially through the Dark Ages we will see the children of the flesh persecute and destroy the children of the spirit though they both claim one father even as was in the case of ishmail and Isaac the darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the True Light Of God will fade until number wise it glows ever so faintly yet the promise of God will hold true the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness can do nothing about it and I believe that's just an exact statement for our day today there's a very small light in the midst of the 8 billion people in this world but it's so dark out there it doesn't matter that Darkness cannot stop that light there's nothing that that Darkness can do about it amen now up to this time I have not brought out that point in history that I promise to cover that is the intermingling of the religion of nimrod and the Christian religion you will recall that adelus fled from Babylon to pergamus and set up his kingdom outside the reaches of the Roman Empire it flourished over the years nurtured by the God of this world a succession of priest Kings followed adelus until the reign of adelus 3 when for reasons known only in the sovereignty of God he willed the kingdom to Rome Julius Caesar then took both the kingdom physical and spiritual for he became pontiff Maximus of the babylonish religion and was therefore priest king this title passed on to the following Emperors until the time of Maximus 3 who refused it according to Steven's history it was then that the pope took the headship it was then that the pope took the headship the emperor rejected and today there is still a pontiff in the world and he is truly pontiff Maximus he wears a triple crown and resides in Rome and in Revelation 17 God does not not any longer refer to pergamus as Satan's seat nor does he say that is where Satan dwells no the throne room is no longer pergamus but it is Mystery Babylon it is not in Babylon but in mystery Babylon and you know he said he go I'm just going to pause here because if you look at the pope you take a look at the pope and maybe some of his speeches I'm sure that all of us have seen them if you haven't I would recommend looking at them he's a kind old priest isn't he the way he moves the way he talks he's so kind his his his his grammar is probably just about perfect he can speak I don't know how many different languages multiple different languages he's looks like a kind old priest brother Bram talks about the kind old priest he looks like a very kind old man but here we have the Vindicated prophet of God in our age saying he is pontiff Maximus he has f control over the world but many people would say no there's no way we talked about it last time if you just take a look at most Christian websites for their churches you'll see the Apostles Creed where did that come from it's not in Babylon he says but in mystery Babylon it is a city on Seven Hills its head is Antichrist for he has usurped the position of Christ who alone is mediator and who alone can forgive sins yes pontiff Maximus is with us today it's not just way back there in history it's today am now brother bradam he goes into where I really want to get into is the doctrine of the n nicians and we know that this is out of where we've read the scripture that we've read and uh it's taking a little bit to get to this but uh it's verse 14 I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught bailo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so Hast them also them that hold the doctrine of the nicotin which thing I hate now I read both those verses in order the way they are in the Bible but brother badam brings them out in the reverse order first he hits on the nicians and that's what we're going to dig into and hopefully we can get through that I would really love to get into balum and baac tonight but I don't think we will Revelations 2:15 he says so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickoles means which thing I hate paragraph 175 you will recall that I brought out in the Ephesian age that word nikotin comes from two Greek words Niko which means to conquer and Leo which means the leoty nikotin means to conquer the Ley now why is this such a terrible thing it's terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness I think that's so good he has never God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness as soon as politics creeps into the church brothers and sisters we have a nician spirit and we're going to call it straight you know what people will call themselves Bishops there's no room for a bishop in the message of the hour there's no room for elders in the message of the hour brother bradam talks about it we're going to get into it I'm I'm feeling like I'm going to preach a little bit but there's people that will say that they're an elder and they're over overl lording other churches it's against the message of the hour we're going to get into that getting excited here now why is this such a terrible thing why is it such a terrible thing to conquer the leoty sometimes we conquer the leoty not by force not by Blood we just heard the prophet say that there is a pontiff Maximus Once Upon a Time he conquered with with force with blood he brought people to church imagine that if you started falling asleep in church the Deacon would come up to you and draw some blood that would wake you up that was the way it was once upon a time it's not the way it is now it's a spiritual battle amen when we start feeling tired and going to sleep in church it's a spirit right but that spirit is a connection to pontiff Maximus this Pope in Rome because we know that that's the Antichrist Spirit we know that's where Satan's seat is we just heard it that's what the prophet said but it's to conquer the leoty sometimes like I said it's not it's not by huge monstrous acts of violence it's with flatteries amen it's with kind words it's with pure form it's with organization and we have the prophet saying here I would say God saying through the prophet it is with political mindedness in the church and he goes on to talk about it how how how Bishops were set up over the the pastors and then there was archbishops over them and then there was Cardinals over the archbishops that's not God's program brother Ram talks about it we'll we'll continue on here he says he's placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood now you can you can you don't have to look very far I know it and I don't really know a lot of history because I came into the the message in 2005 but you can you can see this spirit in the message now it'll never actually ever denominate this message amen but I know even in Calgary there's two people have claimed to be the bishop so I say which one is which one's the bishop I don't know is is it an Archbishop or another Bishop what is it and I'm not trying to be funny what I'm trying to say is it's an antichrist spirit because the prophet said that it's wrong right he placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men who led the people lead the people through feeding them the word he's not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that leadership must be holy but then so must the whole congregation further there is no place in the word where the priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people there's no lordship over God's children nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together nianis destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants I think it's beautiful the way the prophet did this in this book the way that he switched those words veres around he's going for the nickan spirit first because what is it that usually causes the nickan spirit to thrive it's the spirit of balum and baac that one that taught the people to cast a stumbling block to say oh that brother he's he's do you know where he came from do you know do you know what he did don't you know his parents how could he ever pack this message it's it's a terrible thing nickan ISM destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants now this Doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age and I believe when you look at the seals brother brandham talks about it being an actual discussion it starts with a discussion first it becomes a discussion then it becomes a deed and and here you have it now it appears that the problem lay in two words elders presbyter and overseer seers Bishops though scripture shows that there are several Elders in each Church some began Ignatius among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter I just love how he says it so plainly the truth now the truth of the matter the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man the Elder is the man Bishop is the office of the man Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord he is an elder not because he is elected or ordained Etc because he thinks he is but he is older he's more seasoned trained not a novice and I would say this he's got more grace than anyone because he's fought the battles and he knows it's only by his grace that he stands he's reliable because of experience and longstanding proof of his Christian experience but no the Bishops did not stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather they went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus to milus in Acts 20 in verse 17 the record States Elders were called and then in verse 28 they are called overseers Bishops and these Bishops no doubt political minded and anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local Elder with official capacity only in his own church to them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders you know brothers and sisters this is exactly the reason why I had said from the very beginning when we talk about the church in Lethbridge that's a sovereign work that is not a satellite church of Calgary Living Word we said to them pick a name make your church it's your church it's not our church every single Church is Sovereign is what the prophet of God said he goes on to say such a concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the stature of polycarp leaned towards such organization and last time I think I was reading ahead and this is where I got mixed up last time we talked about this polycarp would have been the one for the age but because he leaned to organization he was not chosen of God to be the one who was actually the messenger to that age thus that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal Doctrine and so it is today Bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work where unto I have called them this is antiw word and anti chist many people I I've heard people say they're kind of looking for the Antichrist the Antichrist I love the way the prophet of God said if it's antiw word if it's one word off it's antiw word if it's anti- word it's Antichrist it's that simple it's either all the word or it's none of the word Jesus called on this is uh Matthew 20: 25-28 but Jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the prince of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many Matthew 238 to9 but ye be but ye but be not ye called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven he says in order to clarify this even more let me explain nanism in this way you recall that in Revelations 13:3 it says and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast now we know the wounded head was the Pagan Roman Empire that great political world power this head rose again as the Roman Catholic spiritual Empire now watch this carefully What did the political Pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered that was the seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth tore and devoured whom she tore and devoured could not rise again as when she destroyed Carthage and sowed her to salt the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same same divide and conquer that is nicolan ISM and God hates it God dwells in unity brothers and sisters if we've got a division Spirit it is of the devil it is an antichrist Spirit if there's people trying to cast stumbling blocks getting people to look at the hinder parts of other people that's the devil now it's well-known historical fact that when this error crept into the church men began to to VI for the office of Bishop with the result that this position was being given to more educated and materially Progressive and politically minded men and I want to say this maybe even sometimes a little bit more of a tenure in the message a little bit more knowledge in the message maybe a little bit more experience in the message but that's not going to do it that's the same thing we're talking about here brother bradam says human knowledge and program began to take over Divine wisdom's place and the Holy Spirit no longer controlled this was indeed a tragic evil for the Bishops began to maintain that it no longer required a transparent Christian character a transparent Christian character to minister either the word or the rights of the church for it was the elements and the ceremony that counted I say Lord let never never let it be the rights or the elements or the ceremony that counts but let it be the the Holy Spirit L church amen he says this allowed evil men seducers to Ren the flock when you push aside the word anything is possible when we leave out one word that's all satan needs he'll creep into the church he will cause it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless amen and that's why I think it's so important to just call it straight say it's straight it's either right or it's wrong it's one or it's zero it's black or it's white There's No Gray there's no middle ground there's no partialities with it it's right or it's wrong paragraph 183 with the man-made doctrine of the elevation of Bishops to a place not accorded them in scripture The Next Step was the handing out of graded titles that built up into religious hierarchy for soon there were archbishops over Bishops and Cardinals over the archbishops and by the time of bonapace 3 there was a pope over all a pontiff what with the nician doctrine and the amalgamation of Christianity with Babylonian ISM the net results had to be what Ezekiel Saw in chapter 8:1 so I went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all all the idols of the House of Israel portrayed upon the wall around Revelations 18:2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication how is that going to happen brothers and sisters just by signing up under Rome yes sir and you know many times churches have signed up under Rome and people don't even know it right people aren't even aware that the leadership the hierarchy of those churches have already kissed the ring they don't have to do it themselves their leadership has already done it and you know what it is to reject the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's all it takes is to receive the mark of the beast amen and we're not talking about a physical Mark some people are afraid they're coming out with all this new tech technology you can go to Whole Foods in the states I hear and just use your palm to pay just swipe your palm and you can pay some people are getting RF IDs put it under their skin so they can unlock their doors some people are getting real nervous because this technology is on Earth it's already here some people are afraid that they're going to come around and say it's not a virus or or or an antivirus or a vaccine that you're going to have to get now they've proven they can really push this stuff on people and some people are getting real nervous and I think the ones that are getting real nervous they don't actually know that unless they take the Holy Ghost in their life that seal of God that's been promised unless they do that they've already got the mark of the beast it's a spiritual Mark it's not something that we're going to actually physically see some people will be on earth to see it there will be a time where you will not be able to buy or sell unless you actually show what you represent where you'll have to stand up and actually give your testimony and say no I can't do it because I really I missed it I I I went to a church and and heard one time that there was a prophet but I just couldn't Buy in all the way I just somehow wasn't able to live the life or some people maybe just didn't hear about it at all but the bride of Christ she'll be long gone she'll be in the palace when all that happens brothers and sisters don't be looking for natural events brother Bram the prophet for our day who was the voice box of God the one that God chose to speak to this generation he said I see nothing else that needs to happen for the church for the Rapture of the of the Church of God to go there's nothing left to happen except for the rapture we don't need to look for natural events brother Ram goes on to say in paragraph 185 now this nickan Doctrine this rule that was established in the church did not hit off hit it off too well with a lot of the people for they could read the odd epistle or essay on the word written by some Godly person so what did the church do it excommunicated the righteous teachers and burned the Scrolls my they said it takes a special education to read and understand the word why even Peter said that many things Paul wrote were hard to understand having taken away the word from the people it soon came to the people listening only to what the priests had to say this just really struck me you know we're looking way back in history and and here we have people just listening only to what the priest had to say and in doing what he told them they called that God they called that God and His holy word they took over the minds and lives of the people and made them the Servants of a despotic priesthood just hanging there for a minute because this is important this is something we don't want to glaze over this is alive and well today I'm just going to say that now if you want proof that the Catholic Church demands the lives and minds of men just listen to the Edict of theodosius 5 is that right X Theodosia first edict this edict was issued immediately after he was baptized by the First Church of Rome we three Emperors will that our subjects steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by St Peter to the Romans which has been Faithfully preserved by tradition and which now is professed by the pontiff to damasus of Rome and Peter Bishop of Alexandria a man of apostolic Holiness according to the institution of the Apostles and the doctrine of the Gospel let us believe in one godhead of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit the equal Majesty in the Holy Trinity we order that the adherence of this Faith be called Catholic Christians we brand all the senseless followers of the other religions with the infamous name of Heretics and forbid their conventicles assuming the name of churches besides the condemnation of divine Justice they must expect the heavy penalty which our Authority Guided by Heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict can you imagine that doesn't it sound so flowery so precise so so beautifully said my the 15 penal laws that this Emperor issued in as many years deprived of the evangelicals of All rights to the exercise of their religion excluded them from all civil offices and threatened them with fines confiscation banishment and even in some cases death and and all the while thinking that they were doing something for God they were in service for God right do you know what he says we are headed right that way today the Roman Catholic Church calls herself the mother Church she calls herself the first or original church that is absolutely correct she was the original First Church of Rome that backslid and went into sin right she was the first that organized in her was found the deeds and then the doctrine of nicolan ism no one will deny that she is a mother she is a mother and has produced daughters now a daughter comes from comes out of a woman a woman robed in Scarlet sitting on Seven Hills of Rome she is a harlot and has born daughters those daughters are the Protestant churches that came out of her and then went right back into organization and nanism this mother of the daughter churches is called a that is a woman who was untrue to her marriage vows she was married to God she was married to God Amen and then went off fornicating with the devil and in her fornications she has brought forth daughters that are just like her this mother and daughter combination is anti- word anti-p and consequently Antichrist yes Antichrist amen now before I get too far along I want to mention that these early Bishops thought that they were above the word I say Lord help us amen they told people they could forgive their sins upon confession of those sins that never was the truth they began to baptize infants in the 2 Century they actually practiced regeneration of baptism no wonder people are mixed up today if they were so mixed up then so close to Pentecost now they are in a most desperate condition being 2,000 years away from original truth oh Church of God there is only one hope get back to the word and stay with it amen isn't that a prophet's word isn't that what the prophet said all the way through the Bible just get back to the word now we go back to the verse 14 Revelations 2:14 thou Hast them there that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication the doctrine of balum now we'll just start this and go as far as we can Amen brother Adam says now you just can't have nickan setup in the church and not have this other Doctrine come in too this one really got me because I didn't realize they were linked until I started to read this and study this and and understand this in in the message here you can't you you just can't have a nickan set up in the church and not have this other Doctrine come [Laughter] into you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth amen and when have people human beings ever been able to Worship in spirit and Truth like they can today right we know that where much is given much will be required and for us to say that things need to be a certain way or I can't worship I don't know I wouldn't want to go and tell them that then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells bism and what's that substitution going to be I worship my way I go to church my way I I follow the message my way whatever it can be worship raising your hands maybe you just sing maybe you don't sing maybe you just sit maybe you don't stand maybe you don't come to church you just play tapes whatever it is we worship and we worship in spirit the Holy Ghost and in truth the message of the hour for our day the tying up of all the Loose Ends throughout all the ages that the prophets and the sages desired to look upon even angels wanted to see what we could see amen my how could we not worship I just love how he says this though you can't have Nicol nianis without having the doctrine of balum he goes on to say if we are going to understand what the doctrine of balum is in the New Testament Church we had better go back and see what it was in the Old Testament Church and apply it to that third age and then bring it up to the present this isn't just a historical talk this is about understanding the spirit is alive and well today both of these spirits nanism and the doctrine of balum they're friends now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God they were the Pentecostals of their day they had taken Refuge under the blood didn't they the Passover they had all been baptized in the Red Sea they all crossed over and they came up out of the waters singing in the spirit and what dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost ghost but yet the Holy Ghost wasn't given how could that be if the same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you brothers and sisters you're going to want to beat a tambourine because you recognize what he's done for you my dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophetess played her tambourine well after a certain time of journeying these children of Israel came to Moab I just love how he ties up the history how he brings things out and and shows sort of where these things come from and and how they tie together he says you remember who Moab was he was the son of lot by one of his own daughters it wasn't in a proper relationship and lot in turn was the nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab they were related I want you to see that he says why does he want us to see that the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not so Israel came up to the borders of Moab and sent Messengers to the king saying we're brothers let us pass through your land if our people or our animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for it but King baac got very excited and you know I'll call the musicians so we'll end on time tonight he says that head of the nickan bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost isn't it interesting how he ties that together the children of Israel I don't think it says in the Old Testament anything about the Holy Ghost does it I could be wrong about that but I don't think it talks about the children of Israel Having the Holy Ghost but yet we have a prophet in our day the Vindicated Prophet saying that they had the signs and wonders they they had the pillar of fire and they had the cloud they had the leadership of God in their lives so they had the Holy Ghost because he is the same yesterday today and forever but by that leadership of the Holy Ghost here we have this King that doesn't want anything to do with it because they're just a little too excitable they they just play their music a little bit too loud maybe they sing some modern songs and not just the oldtime religion hymns but they had the Holy Ghost he says with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd so bailo refused to let Israel pass through no we don't want any of those Holy Rollers coming here don't be getting too excited in our midst in our gates don't do that you're going to be out of order we know that brother bradam came and he set the church in order Christ came through brother Bram and set the church in order if there's going to be a speaking in tongues it's going to be done according to the word of God and that's part of the word of God speaking in tongues there's many different gifts of the Spirit a and we're not going to put a a stopper on any one of them but they're going to be according to the word yes sir because if they're not according to the word the devil can impersonate any one of those gifts and he will yes sir and if we allow him to then we're going to be responsible for it yes sir but if gifts manifest and they're not according to the word then you know what the prophet said he said you got a devil in your midst we got to know where we stand brothers and sisters this is spiritual warfare this is not playtime brother bradam goes on to say in fact so great was his fear of them isn't it interesting the fear of of unbelievers so great was his fear of them that he went to a hirling prophet called balum and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition the almighty to curse Israel and render them impotent to try and take that down and you know brothers and sisters if we're not careful we can get that Spirit upon us and that Spirit isn't going to manifest as a monster that spirit's going to manifest in words Spirits travel in words the doctrine of the nicians and and the doctrine of balum is going to travel in words do you know that brother do you know what he does do do you know that sister do you know how she dresses do you know that that other person that Pastor do you know that deacon do you know that song leader let's talk about their hinder Parts I want to say it again tonight the spirit of the Living God in in the True Believer is going to say shut your mouth Ministry I don't want to hear one word of it because I know it's the devil amen because the word of God says if you've got an accusation against someone what should you do go to someone else and tell them about it and say oh I don't like what that brother did did you see what he did we need we need to maybe do something about that maybe we need to form a committee and and and and take a vote what we need to do is go to that brother and go to that sister and tell them what's happened and allow God to come on the scene and move amen but if we're not careful this spirit is Alive and Well brothers and sisters I'm I'm saying it this way because I know I'm guilty I've talked about people in the past and I've had to go say hey I've said stuff and I'm sorry because I know it's not right and maybe even if it is right it's out of turn it's not up to me to go and talk about maybe stand with me as we close this this this is super powerful this can either tie people down or set people free by the way I see it if we're able to understand the doctrine of the nicians the lordship over man in the church and and and the doctrine of balum trying to cast a stumbling block my what is it say in the words here he says but I have a few things against thee in verse 14 because thou Hast them there that hold the doctrine of balam who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel could you imagine standing on that day and being told by the video that's played back on the Jumbotron of Our Lives that we taught someone to cast a stumbling block before another believer and changed their walk took away their ability to have the victory of the Holy Ghost in their life we've got to guard ourselves to eat things sacrificed on I it's okay we can just do it it's it's fine we can we can have idolatry and still serve God in the message of the hour we we can commit fornication and it's okay we'll we'll still be okay it'll just work out we don't have to worry about it you know what the prophet says is the natural types the spiritual the natural types the spiritual God bless you tonight let's just pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we certainly love you and we thank you for your word we thank you for the the words that you gave to your Vindicated Prophet Lord we know that those words were for whosoever has an ear and Lord we're so thankful that we have ears to hear what your spirit says to the church and even as I read these things Lord and I I can see things around and father I just pray that Lord I I don't want to point the finger at anyone I want to point the finger at me I want to say Lord forgive me if I have ever gone down the road of entertaining either one of these Spirits Lord oh Father we know that this is exactly what the devil wants he wants to get in the church he wants to cause it to be lukewarm formal and powerless but we know that you said there will come a time and now is where men will worship you in spirit and in truth and father I know full well that I was just like that woman at the well father I I I had my life as a wreck but you came along and you spoke to me you went out of your way Lord Jesus to come and speak to me father I pray that we would all be able to recognize that if we have ears to hear that you have given us the ability to talk with with you father we pray that you would just Quicken these words to our our very Souls Lord that maybe we would just want to go home and study what we've talked about tonight that we would want to investigate it that we maybe would look at the scriptures father that we would just examine the word and see where we fit father we love you and we thank you tonight we just want to commit each life into your hands amen as we go our separate ways now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen can we sing that song Have Thine Own Way Lord Have Thine Own Way Have Thine Own Way Lord have thy own
