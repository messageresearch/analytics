the Lord some things have been on my heart a lot of it's about fighting fighting for the word and so many times as Sons and Daughters of God we just fight defensively sometimes we're meant to go on the offensive this poem is called claiming the land of promise I hope it's an encouragement for some of you the spirit of adoption awakens my soul a whisper from Heaven that makes me whole no longer a Wanderer in Shadows onk no one I found my purpose his light is my own I once followed uncertain and slow but now I lead it's my time to grow no longer a shadow of might might have been I Rise To Conquer to Triumph and to win I'm claiming my ground with sword in hand this heart is my halter the open book my land the promise of God is Not distant dreams they live in my spirit they flow in my streams the journey has been filled with valleys and trials but these battles only brighten my smile for each weakness that rises daring its place I face it head on and discover his grace my faults are not chains meant to hold me low but Stepping Stones where his glory will show each shortcoming each qualm each defect I see is a door through which Christ Works Victory the strength I possess is not my own it Springs from his throne his life is my banner my spirit's true home I Rise not in might nor through Power or Pride but by the faith of the one who walks close by my side amen I now confront each flaw with a heart that's bold for my weaknesses his strength is revealed and told every failure I face I no longer conceal for the spirit Within Me commands me to heal I stand and fight determined not to yield until every enemy is conquered on the field the ground that I tread is promised and secure the fruits of these battles will endure forever Victory is the flavor of the faith I embrace the peace and the joy that only God can place each Triumph is richer than I ever believed for in him I've discovered all things can be achieved I no longer wait for a new season to start my time is now his kingdom is in my heart the spirit cries out you are my son so I Rise with courage my race begun I move with intention his calling in view a warrior of Promise strengthened by truth this is my land my promise my fight and I walk by faith and not mere sight the spirit of adoption breathed New Life In Me from glory to glory from the message to life true I take my place my calling my crown for the sun Within Me stands firm and not backing down I've faced countless trials thorns and dark days yet every time the joy of Victory filled my heart with praise with each step I take his voice encouraging me well done my child child you now walk in me the spirit of adoption has called me by name I stand as his son unashamed Without Blame my faults and fears yield to the faith I profess through him I fight through him I am blessed Lord bless you all [Applause] amen what the what the L sisters if you'd come up for special [Music] [Music] here among the Shadows living in a

Jesus we thank you for this opportunity once again to gather together father the way that you've ordained for us father we know that this world is changing and it's changing rapidly and father it's just just a little bit of time seemingly before those two witnesses appear in Israel amen we know the Levites even today are practicing for the Feast of trumpets Lord we know that all Israel is crying for the Messiah and father we know there's only one thing left for the Church of the Living God and that is the change of our bodies amen Lord Jesus we look towards that today understanding that Mercy Walked In amen Your Grace came and pleaded our case Lord Jesus hallah oh Father even before the foundation of the world not just when we first came to church or heard that you sent a prophet but Lord in your divine plan amen yes you chose us in you father Lord amen Lord we have no reason to hold back our Thanksgiving yes am did Father you are so wonderful we just want to continue to remember Sister jarmaine Lord we lift her up to you father and we thank you for her test testimonies so many times about how you have come on the scene for her in her life Lord father the witness that she Bears we pray that you would just one more time lord Jesus come on the scene and make her whole again father Lord that she would be able to come to church again father and worship you and thank you Father with her brothers and sisters and her families Lord Jesus we just want to remember Tyson Sanderson Lord according to the request of sister Amber father we met him in the church basement one night at a prayer meeting and father we pray that you would just touch him Lord that he would be able to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection the same way that sister Amber has father we know that your arm is not too short oh Father and that you are more than able and we just want to commit him into your hands For Your Glory father we pray for the unspoken requests Lord Jesus you know

Jesus let us join together and be one with you today Father Lord help us all to just get out of the way and give you the preeminence that you desire we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to to read from 1 Peter chapter 3 1 Peter chapter 3 bit of an unusual direction today but we trust the Lord will bless it am certainly thankful for his grace my 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 1 it says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of ploting of hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you would just bless this word father we know that it's your word that you've given to us father and we know that you have given all of your word for a purpose Lord for teaching for correction for leadership Lord for encouragement and we just invite you you Lord to take this word and allow it to be all those things father that today we would learn and grow that father we would not leave this building the same way that we came in we just pray that Lord you would just take us now by the hands and walk with us father let us walk with you Lord Jesus we just invite you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements we have uh the Youth Event this afternoon at the Clon residence and we're certainly excited to get together and have lunch and break bread we're also excited to hear what the Lord has placed on brother Jerry's heart brother Jerry Fox is with us from end time message Tabernacle and uh he's got I think a couple words of encouragement for us so we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord's placed on our brother's heart we're attempting to to uh actually we have brother ciz acuan here on the 27th of October that will be next Sunday we're excited to hear what the Lord has placed on his heart as well and uh we're attempting to secure a venue a gymnasium for the 31st but it's looking dismal it might not happen so in the event that doesn't happen we will certainly Open Up Our Place um either our house or the hall just for a place to get together for those people that want to on the 31st while the rest of the world goes and celebrates their own thing we can get together and just have a little bit of Fellowship um yeah and that's it for announcements today I'm certainly happy to be here and I know this is an interesting topic many times in the past we have talked a lot about husbands and today we just felt led to go down the road of wives and to talk about the sisters and I trust that it will be a blessing to us um many times it can seem uh really hard the scripture but we know that it's given to us for a purpose and we don't want to make excuses for the scripture we want to take the scripture and uh we want to apply it in our own lives that's the only way we're going to have success that's the only way we're going to be able to overcome the enemy in the day in which we live is to take the book and eat it and uh you know many times we can look at the word and we can look for all of the deep meanings and all of the Mysteries and talk about the seals and on and on and and there's nothing wrong with any of that I won't diminish any of it because it's all important it's all vital that's how we can look at the word that's how we're supposed to look at the word but sometimes I think it's important for us to just have a little bit of where the rubber meets the road so to speak where we're living right now today and that's where we want to go to and today I want to talk about this scripture that we've read out of First Peter chapter Chapter 3 The footnote in uh in my Bible at the top it says a Meek Spirit on this entire page and I think it's it's quite interesting that that's what it would say um I'm not making that my title but I'm just trying to set a bit of a background to show you where I'm coming from the Lord put a scripture on my heart and uh so I'm just following the Lord and uh I trust that it will be a blessing that he will take this word today and use it for us to uh allow us to grow and and to just be better while we go through this study this uh service today I just would like to remind us that as we speak about the wives here and we talk about the natural aspects of our lives and our wives we're also talking about his wife so we're not just talking about the females in the church even though we are and will we're talking about the brothers too because the brothers are real quick to say that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm his wife and we need to make sure that we're lining up with his word as his wife because our wives are only going to follow the word they're only going to follow us the way we follow Christ and if we're not following Christ properly in our life then she ain't going to do it in her own life but it's interesting because the word of God says that even she can do something about it not by actually getting angry and calling her husband out when he's not in the word but she can actually change the circumstances herself by following the word what a tremendous blessing that is even when he does her wrong she still can make the choice to actually talk smack about her husband to her friends to her brothers to her sisters maybe to co-workers whatever it is or she can actually have a conversation that talks good about her husband and causes her husband to receive a blessing and what happens is it changes the circumstances in their home in their lives but in our scripture today likewise I'll just read it again likewise 1 Peter chapter 3:1 likewise he wives be in subjection to your own husbands Brothers and Sisters Let's be in sub be subject to our husband the Lord Jesus Christ that if any not obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives Now isn't it interesting because I believe we can actually take and and talk about our brothers and our sisters and and say maybe this brother's off and this sister's off and look at their behavior and look at that or brothers and sisters we have the opportunity to talk good about that brother and sister to say maybe they have something in their life maybe there's something that's caused them to behave the way they are and they just don't know maybe they're just under the influence of something maybe they're being afflicted by something maybe we don't understand their circumstances their situation we have the ability to change the conversation is what I'm getting at verse two says while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear my verse three is the scripture that the Lord I believe spoke to me on and uh you know I like to go back and forth when I do get a verse but verse three says who's adorning let it not that outward adorning of pling of the hair and of wearing gold or of putting on apparel it's not an outward expression that we're trying to present to the world it's not a whitewash is it we know that brother bradam said it we need to be washed white not just on the outside whitewashed not not doing our hair really fancy and and the plating of hair I looked it up and and this is not specific about anyone just for the record plating of hair is braids many braids and it's a wonderful thing but what I want to say is if that was all we had what would we have but we go a little bit further we can see that it's not the plating of hair it's not how we do our hair it's not talking about cutting hair we'll get to that but it's how we do our hair it's not the way we do our hair that makes us saved that shows that we're Believers that's not it it's not the wearing of gold jewelry we were talking to Brother John and and sister namita about the class system in India and the more gold you have the better you are and that's not it either it's not wearing of jewelry it's not the outward appearance it's not adorning uh the outward appearance plating of hair and wearing of gold or putting on of apparel putting on the Babylonian garment we talked about that in uh the story of aen he wanted that Babylonian garment and and we don't we don't look at it that way that's not what's going to do it for us verse four is the key but let it be the hidden man of the heart and isn't it interesting that it would say the hidden man of the heart not the hidden woman because I thought he was talking about wives was he talking about wives he's just talking about wives remember we're talking about his wife too and and we know that Ephesians chapter 5 I'm going to get there jumping ahead now like usual but isn't it interesting because he said Paul said I I speak concerning a mystery between Christ and the church the two become one and they don't become her they become him so here we have the scripture saying let it be the hidden man Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ but what happens is that invisible Union causes something invisible to happen am sometimes in our lives I think we can get caught up in talking about the invisible Union and saying amen bless God I'm I'm invisibly unionized with the Lord Jesus Christ and still live like the rest of the world just because we know a quote doesn't mean we're saved but let it be the hidden man Jesus Christ of the heart in that which is not corruptible that's where I want to draw the the the identity here this is there's only one thing that's not corruptible we know that that's the Lord Jesus Christ God himself Elohim even the ornament of a what of a Meek and quiet Spirit now we can talk about wives and how they ought to have a Meek and quiet spirit and I'm sure we could get a an amen out of all the brothers maybe if the sisters weren't in the room right but that's that's what the word says that that it shouldn't be the way we dress shouldn't be the perfume we wear it shouldn't be the things that we do on the outside that it should be from the inside that manifests but it's not just about the wives it's about his wife we ought to have a Meek and quiet Spirit also not always needing to get the last word not always needing to be the one who's right as brothers and sisters we ought to be encouraging one another we ought to be kind and tenderhearted according to the word but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of a great price as as I was studying this I just I really like to think about it in in many different aspects but where is the sight of God where's the sight of God we've said it many times in the past and I know people are probably getting tired of hearing me say it that way but you know the sight of God is in our brother and our sister his eyes are all throughout the world we know that he he's God he can do anything he wants but he chooses to work through men is that right that's what the prophet said he chooses to work through men so he's actually going up and down through the Earth looking at all of the different situations through brothers and sisters eyes he's listening with brothers and sisters ears and he's listening to the conversation that we're having but it's in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands so looking at this they were Sub in subjection to their own husbands it doesn't look like they were actually forced to be in subjection to their own husbands and some might say wow there was some pretty hard task Masters back in the day and wives were just property and more like slaves and on and on and that's true but that's not what the word is saying here the word is saying that they they being in subjection un unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord she didn't have to call him Lord do you think Abraham beat her until she called him Lord Abraham loved her and she called him Lord even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement and that word amazement in my Bible says sudden Calamity we can have sudden calamities I'm not going to go on to verse S talking about husbands I don't want to do that today I want to talk about the wives the sisters in our our church in our lives it's so incredible to look at this I think it's just a wonderful thing whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating of the hair and of wearing of gold and putting on apparel not the outward appearance but let it be the man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price that that spirit that he's looking for is his own spirit it's a wonderful thing we don't have to try and find a way I'm telling you if we're trying to find a way to live our live our lives with a a Meek and a quiet Spirit we've got it wrong we're impersonating Christianity what we need to do is get the Holy Ghost in our life when we get the Holy Ghost in our life that is what we are going to project now some people are going to argue and say brother Barry that's not possible don't you know my genetics my genetics are like this and maybe they will be but we will always come subject to the word of God if we've got the Holy Ghost if we don't come subject to the word of God I'm going to say it straight you don't got the Holy Ghost it's one or the other I say Lord help me I'm not throwing off on anyone I just know that he led me this way and the only thing I can do is just follow him just allow him we need to make sure that it's not just our adorning we can come to church on time we can part our hair just right we can say the right things we can sing is right but do we have that hidden man in the heart or are we quick to just go and have a conversation and just talk smack about that brother do you know about that brother what that brother's done do you know what that sister does are we doing that that's not that Incorruptible man that's another spirit and we need to repent for it our adorning on the outside is just a whitewash that's all it is it's just a whitewash but it needs to be that hidden man in the heart that only one that's incorruptable and it's an ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit you know what that is that's a gem I'm going to say it this way this is Brother Barry's interpretation when I hear that word ornament it makes me think it's a gem in his crown that's what we are brothers and sisters were gems in his crown we know that's what the word says but what does that it's actually that life of Jesus Christ Living out through us and there's no way we're ever going to be able to hold tow that line we'll never be able to live with a Meek and quiet Spirit properly on our own and so to this morning while we're here I just was thinking about this and and another scripture came to mind second Peter chapter 3 let's turn there second Peter chapter 3 if you don't mind just a couple pages over second Peter chapter 3 Paul the Apostle the first church age messenger setting the pattern for all other Church ages in second Peter chapter 3 in verse one he says this epistle beloved I now write unto you and we know that that he was speaking to a specific group of people and and I'm I want to say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them when I see that you there I say he's talking to me this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance what's our Pure mind there's only one mind that's pure and that's that Incorruptible man that that one that's on the inside with a a Meek and quiet Spirit that's Jesus Christ our Pure Mind by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful mindful not just simply aware I've got it somewhere in a quote in a book maybe I've made a note I heard it somewhere no it's it's mindful it's our minds are full of what he's talking about here that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior and we know that it goes on to talk about the day of the Lord I don't want to go there I just want to say that he he gave us this scripture for a purpose this this this scripture that we're reading today the the First Peter chapter 3 second Peter chapter 3 this scripture is given to us to stir up our Pure Minds that that man that inner man that lives inside of us to stir him up a little bit in our lives to to make us think about our lives to make us consider our ways how are we conducting ourselves as the Believers of the greatest message that's ever struck the Earth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we know that all other Church ages had a portion but they never had the whole even when the apostles were here they had Jesus the Nazarene they had Jesus Christ until he died was buried and rose again and he came back and and just gave him a little tiny bit of encouragement before he went up we know that but then he gave a little portion of himself to every single age a little dispensation of Grace that Grace that walked in and pleaded our case just a little dispensation a little dispensation seven times until he got to the seventh one and now we have the fullness of the word in our lives that is the man we're talking about today the fullness of the message of the hour Jesus Christ the fullness not just a portion but here here he's trying to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance that we may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and today I just want to say this I don't want to change the word of God but I just would like to maybe substitute this just for a second for the the sake of illustration to say the holy prophet in our day to stir up our minds that we may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophet in our day and of the Commandment of us and the Apostles of the Lord and savior we know that William Mary and brandom he never brought his own word the only thing he did was point back to the word and to highlight the word and to break it open and tie up the Loose Ends and make it all one word without a whole bunch of controversy today where I want to go to brothers and sisters I would like to talk a little bit about the house of the Lord a and about being around our Believers our brothers and our sisters in the the house of the Lord I I think it's a beautiful place this is a sacred place this church not this building necessarily when we all come together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ This is a sacred place we know that's the only provided place of worship given to us in this age in Jesus Christ we know that there's only one age that Satan is the god of the age and that is this age the prophet in our day declared that but this ought to be the safest place that we could ever come to the house of the Lord where we gather together with our brothers and our sisters and you know I just think that we need to get into a little bit of maybe housekeeping items there's some things that maybe we just need to consider how sacred this place really is sometimes we can just maybe forget about how sacred this place place is let's take a step back and look at the Tabernacle in the wilderness we know that picture we've had it brought up many times I don't even know if it's convenient there now if it is it might be good to bring it up the Tabernacle in the wilderness we know that there is the the fence on the outside there's the outer Court that's called then there's the inner chamber but then there's another place that's behind the very back Veil and and that's the holy of holies the holy place that's the place where the priest was able to enter one time in a year to make the ultimate sacrifice for the children of Israel and and we know that if he went into that building one iota off from what the word instructed him to be on they drug him out by the cord that was tied to his ankle because he wasn't righteous and so I just want to say brothers and sisters do we actually see this Gathering here like this to be like that or is this just another gathering at a church building somewhere in southeast Calgary where the air is a bit stinky and lots of bugs is is it just the natural things that we're looking at or do we actually sense the presence of almighty God because when we walk through those doors brothers and sisters some people are just coming in and plunking down in a church building and that's it other people are coming and walking beyond that inner Veil and going into the holy of holies and I want to say I encourage everyone to look at this building as going Beyond the Veil into the holy of holies I don't know I I all of this is unscripted it's interesting I love it the way the Lord leads you know there's many things that go on inside this building that are kind of surprising at times that are actually contrary to what the prophet said and and it happens and you know what I can say I'm guilty but I that's why I think maybe today I just wanted to I felt led to go down this road of maybe just a little housekeeping a little stirring up our Pure Minds the mind of the lord inside of us by way of remembrance to say hey wait a second yeah the prophet did say that maybe I forgot about it in case anybody didn't know I'll tell you this the priest the high priest did not go in behind that inner Veil and clip his fingernails he wasn't in that inner Veil clipping his fingernails so I want to recommend don't clip your fingernails in the Church of the Living God it might not bother you but it can certainly bother someone else and I guarantee you it bothers him because we're not reverencing this place and like I said it's not the building so much as it is the people gathered together in the building so sometimes we let our children just make noise sometimes our children I don't have something here will just have I maybe this will work you just be trying to listen to the preaching of the word and a child will just be like this and and I just want to say where's the parents let's going on we can be doing things that are distracting to other people sometimes children are moving around sometimes there's different things happening as parents it's our responsibility to make sure that we are governing this it's not the Deacon's responsibility to say you shouldn't do that in the house of the Lord you shouldn't do that in the house of the Lord we should be teaching our children at home the Holiness of this Gathering that we're meeting with allmighty God this is not playtime this is the house of the Living God the priest didn't go and clip his fingernails wonder why I'm saying that when we do the house cleaning in here we found fingernails and I know in the past I've heard clipping I've heard it years ago not now when I'm up here Not much bothers me to be honest with you it really there's not much that bugs me up here and I think it's wonderful but when I sit and I try and listen if there is a minister ministering and sometimes you just I I don't know Wonder where's the parents are the parents there do they hear it but I know what happens brothers and sisters because I'm a parent and I'm not going to throw off on parents because we have to have parents because we have to have children if we're going to see this message go on should the Lord Terry who is going to pick up the Baton and go forwards with it there has to be children we're supposed to go forwards and have children that is what the scripture says the two become one and that is the fruit of their Union we have to have children children need to come to the house of the Lord we want to encourage that but we also don't want to make this the training room we want to make it a place where we can worship where the children understand that there's reverence there has to be holy reverence in this building it's the same God that was behind that fail either it is or it isn't we can say well it's different today is it isn't it Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus is not a different person from that God that was behind that inner Veil if we do that we're going to make them a second or third person don't do that the house of the Lord ought to be the safest place that we can come to to worship to feed upon the word to encourage our brothers and sisters to receive encouragement from our brothers and sisters I heard it one time I thought it was so good I'll say it this way Adrien Rogers he said it he's not a message believer I don't think but he's a good preacher but he said you know going to church on Sunday isn't all about you what can I get out of church today what is the preacher going to preach sometimes it's about bringing yourself so you can be an encouragement to others yes when your brother and sister is feeling like I could just barely make it I don't know if I could stand another day but I'm going to go and so they get there and they're down in their heart they're down in their mind down in their spirit and they just need something and there's one brother there that just shakes their hand in just a different way and says God bless you in such a way that they feel appreciated and that is all it takes sometimes to take somebody to that next level when all the devils are weighing down their arms and weighing down their heart they can get that handshake out there in the foyer or downstairs or in the parking lot and they come into the service and some of those Devils fall off and when the singing starts to happen something happens and suddenly those Devils fall off alog together and they don't care who's looking and they can start to worship God the way that he desires to be worshiped the high priest did didn't go back behind that inner Veil and say wow I've heard that before you ain't going to teach me nothing I ain't never heard I've been in the message way longer than you've ever been around he didn't do that he went back there with total reverence because he didn't come to see anyone else except for almighty God the house of the Lord ought to be the safest place for us to come to to be able to worship to bring our families to it's not about the outward adorning if that's what it is brothers and sisters I want to say just take a step backwards and get right with God because it's not about the outward adorning it's all about the inward work the inner man living out through us now remember as we speak about all this we're also speaking about Christ in the church the wife is the feminine taken from the man the masculine now sometimes that can be a real interesting one when we look at the natural typing the spiritual sometimes our wives can be a little bit different than maybe we are God knows exactly what we need and you know that's the way it is the wife is the feminine taken from the man she is that mass that feminine portion taken out of the man the masculine and we know that the church is the feminine that was taken from Christ the masculine and and you know when we talk about this in this light is it it isn't it interesting you can just see it we've said it many times in the past but it's no wonder the world is all mixed up about the masculine and The Feminine and what's your pronoun and what is all this business I mean what is that that's the anointing of understanding where we're at today Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever the husband the Heavenly bridegroom who has taken his Earthly bride his Earthly bride and him become one you know in the Amplified Bible I just would like to speak um about this scripture I'm going to read this scripture out of the Amplified Bible and I'm not saying that I know I've talked about using different Bibles bear with me the Amplified Bible in uh 1 Peter chapter 3 the same scriptures that we've read and like manner you married women be submissive to your own husbands subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them and adapt yourselves to them so that even if any do not obey the word of God they may be one over not by the discussion not by discussion but by The Godly lives of their wives I think it's just interesting to shine a light on it from a little bit of a different perspective because many times I'm guilty of it before I even say it many times we can have something happen in our marriage and we can be real quick to go and talk about our wives or our husbands in a certain way to other people and not a good way in a negative way and when we do that we're actually not helping the situation what we're doing as we're pouring gasoline on the fire and brother bradam says that we're actually attacking that person's character and I think he even says assassinating their character you can kill a man without actually killing him you can kill his influence just by talking bad about him and wives can do that about their husbands and husbands can do that about their wives Brothers can do it about sisters sisters can do it about brothers Brothers brothers sisters sisters we can destroy one another just by talking about one another goes on to say when they observe the pure and modest way in which Al I'll just go back and read this again and stop talking in like manner you married women be submissive to your own husband subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them and adapt yourselves to them so that even if any many do not obey the word of God they may be one over not by the dis by discussion but by Godly lives of their wives when they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves together with your reverence for your husband you are to feel for him all that reverence includes to respect defer to rever him to honor esteem appreciate apprciate prize and in the human sense to adore him that is to admire praise be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband now I'm reading all this and I'm thinking my I want to blush because I don't think that I'm saying this that I want my wife to actually try and get a message here but this is what the word in the Amplified Bible is saying about second Peter chapter 3 in the King James version this is how the wives ought to actually conduct themselves towards their husbands I want to ask the question is that what we're doing now I want to take it and parallel it and say as the Bride of Jesus Christ Brothers brothers sisters are we behaving this way about our heavenly father why goes on to say let not yours be merely external adorning with a elaborate interweaving and nodding of the hair and wearing of jewelry or changes of clothes don't don't let it be just 10 or or half an hour early for service and a bunch of quotes that I know and everything is good in my life and my car is clean and I got money in the bank and I believe the message of the hour but yet I mistreat my wife or I mistreat my husband no don't let it be the outward adorning I would say this brothers and sisters I'd much rather see you 10 minutes 20 minutes late for service and be serving God with all your might than to see people who are washed whitewashed now I'm not saying we are I just feel led to go this way forgive me I don't know sometimes you just have to let the Lord lead not yours be the merely external adorning with elaborate interweaving a noding of the hair and wearing of jewelry or changes of clothes but let it be the inward adorning and Beauty the hidden person of the heart who's that person is it me is it you no we talked about it it's Jesus Christ the hidden person of the heart with The Incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful Spirit which is not anxious or rought up but is very precious in the sight of God for it was thus that the pious woman of all who hoped in God were accustomed to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and depending upon them it was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by calling him Lord Master leader Authority and you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you this is pretty strong and to look at it I think it's fascinating also because we know brother Branham talks about everybody wants to talk about Jesus everybody in the Christian World wants to claim the blood of Jesus everybody wants to talk about the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and say the name of Jesus but there's only a few people that really want to say Lord Jesus because when we say Lord Jesus that means he is governing over all of the Affairs in our lives all of the Affairs and to look at this here to see the way it's written is that she called him Lord she acknowledged his headship by calling him Lord Master leader Authority now I'm not saying brothers and sisters that by any means I would insist or encourage that our sisters would call our husbands Lords but there is a scriptural value to it and I would say defer to the Holy Ghost and see what he tells you about it I'm not going to say that you should do anything I think that's so beautiful we're going to talk about this as we go we're not a church that preaches dos and don'ts except EX for one thing and one thing alone and that one thing is to come to know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection through the baptism the true baptism of the Holy Ghost according to the prophet of Malachi 4 that's the one do that we will encourage we will also say no there's one don't and that is to resist getting the holy ghost in your life because if you resist to get the Holy Ghost in your life then you automatically take the mark of the beast We Don't Preach boy if you're not in service half an hour before that we're going to send the deacons to your house we don't preach that you have got to wear a certain length of skirt or you can't come through those doors We Don't Preach that you can only wear a certain height of heel however that that measurement measures up we We Don't Preach any of that we don't actually try we preach We Don't Preach dos and don'ts is what I'm trying to say and that's not going to happen what we do want to do is encourage us according to the word of God this house should be a House of Prayer it should be a house of worship it should be the safest place that we can ever come to Brothers should be able to come to church and not have to worry about looking at sisters in an ungodly fashion and the reason for that brothers and sisters is sisters should not be coming to church in such a way that a brother is going to be enticed to look at her if that happens there's something wrong with that sister now this isn't just brother Barry saying this this is the prophet of Malachi 4 that's saying it and we're going to get right into it in questions and answers number three we start paragraph 3:30 brother bradam how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her and yet play or stay with the word that's stay with the word but still having a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach or believe and I think I brought this up a little while ago I thought it was just a really good place to start as husbands as wives we really need to make sure that we are practicing what we're preaching well then if the wife if the wife is saying this to you when she's has the right to say it when she has the right to say it you better get right see than if she is saying it just just to be evil remember the Bible said it's better that a millstone was hanged around your neck and drown in the depths of the sea than even to offend the least of these my little ones now that's just yours and I'm just going to throw this out there I've said it before in the past you know the the wives are are a part of the husbands the husbands are a part of the wives many times we would say the wife she's a weaker vessel right and you know I want to say this that doesn't mean that she's not smarter sometimes the wives can be a little smarter sometimes the wives can perceive things in just a little different way maybe they're not more intelligent but maybe they've got the ability to see things and operate things in a way that the husband doesn't just like the husband has the way to do that in his way she's a weaker vessel because she's actually not as strong and also she was the one that was actually tempted we know that a a Adam wasn't tempted Adam wasn't deceived Eve was deceived she can be a little bit weaker in terms of deception that's why she has a husband to lead her see then if she's saying it just to be evil remember the Bible said it was better than a millstone hanged around her neck and drawn on the depths of the sea even to offend even the least of my little ones so I I think it's good how he says this here just going back a little bit well then if the wife if the wife is saying this to you when she's got the right to say it you better get right see but if she's talking evil then we know what he said there going on he says and it may be that this wife is not that type of person maybe she's different maybe she's a good person maybe she's just testing you to see what you'll do now stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you don't just preach Jesus talk is cheat let her see Jesus in you if you want to see her follow you follow Christ let her see Jesus in you see you just go on I give a little illustration this morning about a person one time this little woman had received the Holy Ghost she was a very sweet little person she said well she'd had a hard life and her husband was an coholic and so she just kept on we know that's exactly according to our scripture this morning in 1 Peter chapter 3 she just kept on she bore with him she probably had every right to put him away in her mind naturally speaking in the world he's an alcoholic maybe raging alcoholic maybe just a bum it's interesting because I've got a sister that I know in uh Africa sister Marian's Aunt Auntie she's got a a a story she has a testimony my goodness anyways I'll I'll just carry on here and so she just kept on she bore with him he says you want to go to church honey take off but now he went down to the saloon down at the Old Brown Derby down here going on so they hung out down there till all the time used to be boners many of you old remember when bonifer had the corner it's called Derby now I believe it is so hanging around down there and the first thing you know one night come up a question about church and about Christians and you know if anybody has ever experienced alcohol in your lives you'll you'll know that it's interesting that Christianity and and the name Jesus Christ comes up the discussion comes up when the spirits are at play it's interesting how that happens and it happens one of these old drunks sitting there said there ain't no such thing as Christians anymore now what would cause a man to say that you could only imagine a whole bunch of impersonation a whole bunch of whitewashed people in his life maybe just when he was a kid maybe all the way through his life but somewhere along the way he got to see the Hypocrites that we've heard about and I know that I was guilty of calling Christians Hypocrites but I got corrected the word of God corrects all the error one of these old drunk sitting there said there ain't no such thing as Christians anymore and there's no such thing all these bunch of Hypocrites said you see them out here smoking and drinking doing the same thing that we do and said call themselves Christians there's no such how could you blame them people come to church and then they go out to the bar afterwards and have a drink go and carry on maybe go to different venues where there's just all manner of Evil My we're no different than those people and maybe we are inside but if somebody were to see us they would say look what they're doing look where they're at those are Christians this one drunk raised up and said just a minute there's one that I know about said who is it said it's my wife see can you imagine this guy in his drunken stuper now God is forcing him to Bear Witness he's preaching in his drunkenness it's my wife see she's become salty he was catching it all the time he said I bet if she was put to a squeeze he said no she's still a Christian I'll prove it to you said I'll tell you what Let's do let's go up home and I'll show you whether she's a Christian or not said let's go up home and now let's really be drunk we're going to act like we're really drunk knocked at the door come and staggering over and everything and why the chair sitting around this way and everything and she set them on a chair his guest you know and tried to make them just as welcome as they could be you know I I I I don't think it's this quote but I just can't help but think about how there's a story that brother brandom talks about how the sister said you know doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter where you go make sure you come home to me cuz you're my husband and I love you it makes me wonder would we receive this kind of reception woo no I wouldn't recommend going out and pretending don't go out and drink and come home you don't want this kind of outcome he he says I want you to fix us some supper and so they she went out and fixed some said we we want ham and eggs he know they had it so so they fixed the ham and eggs and when he got there at the table he looked at them like that pick P up his plate and slammed the stuff on the floor now I I can tell you by experience I've witnessed this before in the past and what it resulted in was a bent frying pan guess how the frying pan got bent and I'm not joking it's real I bent frying pan and when he got there at the table he looked at at them like picked up his plate and slammed the stuff on the floor said you know I don't like my eggs like that come on boys let's get out of here anyhow like that they went out and sat down like that you know can you imagine how hurt she must have been how disgusted she must have been Naturally Speaking how upset she must have been probably broke a plate made a big mess here she knew they were drunk she was upset from the very beginning but yet him and his Entourage his posi come in and he makes this big stupid show Naturally Speaking a woman wouldn't do what she did come on boys let's get out of here like that they went out and sat down like that you know and she come out she said dear I'm sorry I didn't get them fixed I'll fix some more for you oh nonsense you know I didn't want them that way in the first place just carrying on like that they went out there and sat down and they acted like they was drunk they heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself singing real low voice my must be that inner man she wasn't wearing something adorning on the outside was she they heard her must Jesus bear the cross alone all the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me this consecrated cross I'll bear till death Shall Set Me Free one drunk looked at the other one said she's a Christian she's got it how could he say that because he was able to witness that inner man he knew what would happen if he went home and tried that with his wife he knew what would happen if they went home and did it to the other guy's wife but there was something different about this one wasn't there one drunk looked at the other one said she's a Christian she's got it and that little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night see why see just be real sweet just remember he knows all about it I just think it's interesting the natural definitely types the spiritual doesn't it know the word says that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives to think that a wife has the opportunity to win that Husband by her conversation let's turn over to First Corinthians still got a little bit of time here I hope that uh hope that we'll be okay 1 Corinthians uh one 1 Corinthians 1 11 1 Corinthians I got myself all mixed up I am sorry yeah 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse one be followers of me even as I also am of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head and that's why in in this inner Veil we don't wear head coverings the men take off their hats the men take off their hoods because that's what the word of God says every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head and we know who his head is we just read it verse 5 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered this is where brother Bram brings the doctrine of cutting hair and this is where we believe it as sisters we don't cut our hair there's no cutting of hair at all according to the word of God some might say well I've got split ends brother Barry at all according to the word of God and if you're going to do it according to the word of God shave it that's what the word of God says and of course we're not going to do that because the covering is our hair for the Sisters verse seven for a man in indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God judge in yourselves is it calmly that a woman pray unto God uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is her covering and if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God I just want to say this doesn't matter how long your hair is sisters don't cut it if it's as long as you can grow it that's your covering that's what God's given you keep it but don't cut your hair don't trim your hair according to the scripture that's what we believe I think it's just a a wonderful thing to take it back to the scripture and see how the Lord has this orchestrated the woman is of the man it's not the other way around we we need to the man is not of the woman but the woman is of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man and you know because of this there's something that is wired inside of a man that will cause him to look at a woman and if a woman doesn't Adorn herself correctly that man will actually look upon that woman and that's the way men are wired that's the way this nature is and that's why I keep going back to this house of God this Gathering should be the safest Gathering that we can ever come to we should never have to fear seeing a sister in any other way than a sister but I can say it once in a while we do now it's awfully quiet so I'm going to be filling in the gaps here you know what brothers and sisters I'll tell you honestly as a male a red-blooded male there's been times where I've come to church and I've thought oh Lord I don't want to see that I'm at church why am I seeing that I can tell you why there's a couple different reasons but the biggest thing is the influence in that sister's life either the husband hasn't said anything or the wife just doesn't know or the wife is under the influence of a wrong Spirit now it's not just brother Barry saying it this is the message of the hour we're going to get into it here we should be able to come to church and not have to fear looking at a sister now I'm going to flip it we should not have to fear sisters coming to church and looking at a brother because I'll say it this way sometimes you see clothing on men that are way too tight anybody going to say Amen to that remember all of the fash is designed by an influence when we're getting styling we need to be careful about the style that we're putting on Brothers make sure your pants are pulled up don't wear skinnies I mean here we go now brother Barry's I can see it brother Barry's preaching dos and don'ts do what you want to do get the Holy Ghost just remember that those skinny jeans are created by someone in a certain place that are under a certain influence see if you can take it back if that Designer believes this message of the hour we can talk about shorts and say wearing shorts and you know women out wearing shorts the husband sitting on the porch got her wife out mowing the lawn wearing a bikini or shorts and a tight shirt it's a story that brother bradam talked about I'm not going to read the quote today you can look it up we're not talking about that we're talking about the Church of the Living God coming to the house of the Lord and not having to fear we should not have to worry about looking at a sister in any other way than her being a sister and if there's something happening where she is showing off certain parts of herself there's an influence going on and it's not the Holy Ghost talking about this first Peter I love this scripture First Peter chapter 3 I just did a little bit of a a quick study on it you know how how strongs concordance has some meanings for words but let it be the hidden concealed man the human of the heart the heart has the thoughts and the feelings which is the heart of that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek mild and humble and quiet still Peaceable Spirit a mental disposition which is in the sight of God a great price sometimes it's not easy to have all of that as a brother or a sister I know that I know that but we talked about a little early I said I was jumping ahead when we look at this word it is a great price in the sight of the Lord where is his sight if we're if we're dressing ourselves in such a way that people can look at us and see our bodies underneath there's something wrong and I know Brothers we want we want to be able to bench press whatever and we want to wear a tight shirt and show our pectoral muscles sticking out in our shirts and you know I want to say is that the Holy Ghost leading us that's doing that cuz brother bradam says that you can be 200 lb of muscle and still be a but the real man how is he identified according to the prophet in our day brothers and sisters how how is the real man identified according to the prophet he says by the bags and the knees of his pants his willingness to go on his knees and pray for his brothers and sisters not the outward adorning it's not just sisters it's brother others we need to make sure that we're not wearing pants slacks dress pants that are too tight showing off more than we ought to just like sisters ought not to be wearing things that are are shirts that are too tight I'm just going to be honest I'm a red-blooded male and I've been embarrassed at times now we know the word says that the women should not wear garments that pertain to a man and and man should not wear garments that pertain to a woman but we can still wear the proper garments according to those classifications but be actually presenting ourselves the wrong way that's the way the devil is he'll work Us in just a little tiny fraction an Iota off of where we should be what I'm getting at is where's the sight of God where's the sight of God you know brothers and sisters I'm not interested in preaching dos and don'ts but I am very interested in upholding a standard a according to the message of the hour get the Holy Ghost in your life go stand in front of a mirror and say Lord is this appropriate for me to come to the house of the Living God to worship am I going to cause Brothers to look at me are they going to see body parts that they shouldn't see before they're married I had a pastor here I don't know who here was around at the time but he went off about knit skirts I didn't even know what they were I had to ask my wife what's a knit skirt I don't even know what a knit skirt is what's a knit skirt anybody know what a knit skirt is I guess there was people wearing net skirts that were not appropriate for the Church of the Living God what I found out is they're very form fitting very thin and what they do is they show off the body why do we want to show off our body because we want to be like the world brothers and sisters whatever we're feeding on that's what we're going to become amen amen let's let's not be looking at the world let's be looking at Christ where's the sight of God in the eyes of your brothers and your sisters and I would say potential even unbelievers people that don't even know the word of God who are maybe drunken fools going over to a buddy's house who's going to mock his wife because he says she's a Christian but that man is going to Bear witness and someday he'll be able to say you know I saw that person dressing immorally that's where the sight of God is is it a time or a place it's no time or place job 34:21 he says for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all of his goings not just some of them where I'm at today brothers and sisters is not just with sisters I'm not throwing off on sisters what I'm doing is trying to uphold a standard I want to try and pull up some bootstraps and encourage us to take a look at our lives let's take a look at the way we behave let's take a look at who we are as Believers of this message of the hour we should have the greatest standard there is are we wearing high heels sisters if we are why are we are we wearing tight fitting clothing if we are why why are we maybe some sisters would say well I've I've gained weight brother Barry I've had children and I I I say Amen you know I understand that that's what happens that's the way this life is but get some different clothes there's different Avenues there's different opportunities and I would say this if anybody has any any opposition to what I'm saying pertaining to that specifically come see me if you need financial aid for that then we'll help you it's important brothers and sisters if man is looking at a woman that woman is going to be held responsible amen that's what God Said through the prophet to this age that's why I'm talking about it here this is not a joke 1965 does God ever change his mind he says so many are doing today the same thing we know that's right they sell out their Birthright ha women professing the Holy Ghost wearing shorts man permitting them in the pulpits Bob haired women in the pulpits paint on their face with religious gowns on the biggest stumbling block the church has ever had if you want to know in political Powers what time it is in the Kingdom age see where the Jews are you see where the Jews are oh my today they were blowing the trumpets for the Feast of Tabernacles the Levites are practicing the Feast of Tabernacles if you want to know in political Powers what time it is in the Kingdom age see where the Jews are watch how the Jews are because they are a nation if you want to know where the nations are standing watch the Jews the Jews are wound up like a spring and they're just about to go off brothers and sisters if you're watching the Jews my goodness if you want to know where the church is standing watch the women watch the morals among the women cuz she's a representation of the church when you see the pollution amongst the women you find the pollution in the church what she become a painted up Jezebel just exactly what the church has become see now that's the truth and you know that see if you want to know where the church is watch your morals among your women cuz she is the church is a woman if you want to know the national status watch the Jews brothers and sisters this is a an encouragement to take a look at our lives we have got to hold the standard strong in this building in this Gathering if we want to see God move in our lives there is no room for variance if you want to see where the church is watch the woman I want to say it this way if we want to see where the Church of the Living God is take a look at the female take a look at all of them look at the husbands don't just throw it off on the wives and say look at them look at them they're wearing clothes too tight heels too high they don't listen to me they're not of a a Meek and a quiet Spirit when we do that are we actually practicing what we preach what we read a little bit earlier or are we changing the situation with our conversation by saying she is my bride I love her with all my heart look at that sister over there maybe she just doesn't have a revelation yet you know what I'm going to do I'm G to go and I'm gonna work on being masculine I don't need pectorals I need bags in my pants like the prophet of God said and I'm going to put them there for my sister I'm not going to throw off on her and likewise sisters when you see a brother we need to make sure that we're looking after one another that's why we have a a church that's why we gather together that's why we're part of a body we have much more than an outward appearance we have that inward man of Christ and if you don't if you don't know if you have that in man of Christ I want to encourage you right now at the sound of my voice to consider looking into getting that inner man of Christ for yourself because that's the only way that we're going to make it out of here we can look into it adorning ourselves with a Peaceable fruit of righteousness not outward appearance of clothing vehicles houses maybe social I've got a great social standing in the Community I got a great social media I've even got my own website on and on I'm saying this because I went down that road we're not adorning ourselves with all of that we want the Peaceable fruit of righteousness we want the people around us to say what is it about you man in Romans chapter 8:22 it says for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit hidden man we even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to ITT the Redemption of our body Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit the fruit of that inner man that fruit that we've talked about that grows on the branches that other people can pick and enjoy the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law Ephesians 5:9 for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth there ain't no room for lies all liars will find themselves in the Lake of Fire but get the spirit of Jesus Christ in your life and he'll burn out all of that Ephesians chapter 5:32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church I think it's so beautiful we can bring it right back to every single one of our Lives it's a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church the masculine and The Feminine we're not we're not worried about dos and don'ts I'm just looking to bring this to the top of our minds this is a place where we should be safe we should be safe to worship freely we should be safe to look anywhere and not have to worry not have to do what I've heard some Christian authors say as a male what you need to do when you see something we know brother bradam talks about it we could talk about this for a little bit brother Bram said he put a cross hanging from the mirror in his car for a purpose that when he saw that immoral woman walking across this is a prophet of God saying this he saw the immoral woman walking across the street he would maybe see it but then his eyes would catch that cross and he would remember the cross of Jesus Christ how he had his Redemption per purchased for him and how that person out there doesn't know him in the way that he knows him what a wonderful thing it is but you know we don't we don't have to worry about being distracted or influenced by what we see in others doing there shouldn't be a desire brothers and sisters to show our bodies off that is worldly I'm going to preach that straight that is worldly if we're looking to show our bodies off that's worldly hey if you've got a beautiful suit or you got a beautiful dress that's that's wonderful and you should show that off not your body right is this right or wrong nor should there be desire to have others notice us this is the house of the Lord and we want to create an environment where we can be safe I've said it and said it and said it it's not dos and don'ts get the Holy Ghost let Jesus Christ come into your heart and see see if you can rationalize your behavior with what he's doing what he wants done because we know full well there's things in this world that aren't spoken about in the Bible and they're not spoken about in the message of the hour that's why it's a treacherous time there's so many choices so many options so many things that we can do on our own but is he Lord because if he's Lord then we're going to say be Lord and help me make this decision whatever it is big or small but you know we don't preach dues ands we preach Christ crucified so we can have his Spirit the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us I was at a meeting I think I talked about this are we okay for a couple more minutes kind of just in a bit of a different service today I hope it's okay I might have to go find a juniper tree when we're done I was at a a meeting with my wife and it was about school dress and our boys attend a Christian School and it was interesting because the the dress code was what was under scrutiny and there's people that want to be able to dress worldly however they want and they're trying to impose that upon the values that the Christian School has they don't have uniforms and there was one family that had I don't know four girls I think and they all had torn up jeans I mean really torn up jeans and really tight tops and you know worldly stuff and uh they were saying the school was saying we're not interested in any tears in our clothes none and if that's what you want to bring then we're going to have to send you home because that's the rule no tears in the clothing well we we've spent so much money on these clothes how are we ever going to be able to do this and The woman there that was moderating she said hey you know what let's let's book a time and I'll actually teach you how to mend I've got a sewing machine we'll get some goods and we'll sew these jeans together I'll teach you how to do it for free we'll get together and we'll do a little workshop and I I was amazed I thought my goodness has she ever heard of the Prophet where people would say we don't have clothing we can't get clothing that's going to fit nicely and what he said was there's still sewing machines and there's still Goods my we're not going to be without excuse but to hear these people get kind of bantering back and forth I was intrigued by it it really captivated me because I knew they were in an uphill battle the world is creeping in and there's nothing they can do about it really and it was interesting to see it and then it wasn't very long before a woman stood up high heels skirt cut hair etc etc she had the opinion and her opinion was that it's not the girl's fault it's all the boy's fault the only reason we're having these problems is the parents aren't training their boys to not look at girls and you know what I say there's Merit to that because as parents we need to be training our boys when they become to that age we are up in Edmonton at a breakfast and there is some really good content there I shared it on the men's chat if anybody has listened to it if you haven't I highly recommend it it's up to us brothers and sisters to make sure that we're teaching our children these things at home if we don't teach our children the world is going to and we don't want a worldly teaching for the message believing children but remember hearing it and I just thought my isn't it fitting it's all the boys's fault that they're looking at these girls they should be taught it's the parents' problem par parental delinquency was basically the road she was going down I thought my goodness I I have to say I agreed to some extent however I don't think she ever heard that God sent a prophet I don't think she ever heard some of the things that that man said you know what message is this here out of leadership out of leadership in 1965 brother bradam said Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after herath committed adultery with her in his heart and that's true and that's what that woman was saying whoever looks on the woman according to the scripture she is right legalistically 100% correct yeah whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her in his heart I say Lord help us then he's got to answer for that and he will and what' she do according to the world she did nothing except for purchase worn out clothing like what purchase worn out clothing and give it to their children and he's got answer for that and what' she do she presented herself who's guilty think of it you say they don't make any other clothes they got goods and sewing machines no excuse that's exactly now I just think it's important to make sure that we bring this part here brother brandham says now I don't want to hurt you and I say today brothers and sisters I don't want to hurt you I don't I just want to encourage us I don't want to hurt you either brother bradam here he says and this is not a joke this is thus saith the Lord from the scriptures it's exactly true friend he says I'm an old man I haven't got much longer to stay makes me wonder if he could look into the future if he could see into time just past 1977 and see some of the stuff that's going on today I'm an old man I haven't got much longer to stay but I've got to tell you the truth this is my last message if this is my last message it's the truth see don't don't sister don't brother and I think it's interesting because this was leadership then there was communion this was his second last message this was his last message really communion was afterwards that's what he said and and you know brothers and sisters that's where I stand I have to make sure that I'm going to line up with him I'm not going to deviate not one iota even if it takes my hide off even if I have to have arguments or whatever it's going to be brothers and sisters we should be able to come to the Church of the Living God and not have to worry this should be the safest place and you know I I just want to say we can actually encourage one another to be safe we can say I don't want to present myself in such a way that I could offend maybe a young boy if I'm a sister maybe if I'm a young man I'm not going to dress in such a way that I'm going to get a sister looking at me I'm going to protect those sisters I'm going to protect those Brothers we have that responsibility we have that capability but brothers and sisters who's guilty who's guilty I want to say look this up it comes up eight hits exactly the same point who is guilty and you know what brother brandham says brother brandham says that when a woman presents herself in such a way that it causes a man to look at her that she has an evil prostitute spirit it's no joke that's brother Bram and knoweth it not 1965 what would have happened to your grandmother if she had walked out on the street with them shorts on they would have put her in the insane institution she'd come out without a dress on there's something wrong with her mind if it was so then it is so now so it throws the whole world into Insanity the whole thing is insane and it's so gradually crept in till people don't know it and then is where brother Barry says I am not going to allow it to so gradually creep into the Church of the Living God that we preach at we have got to uphold the standard brothers and sisters the highest standard and if we have issue with it take it up with God I'm happy to converse with you if you want to about it goes on to say now she is a prostitute not by her husband bowed to her body but before God and I want to say it this way this is just brother Barry spin on it just just bear with me but he's talking about the she but what about the he that will present himself in such a way to cause a sister to look because it happens you know brothers and sisters some of the stats are astounding maybe somewhere down the road Lord willing will actually talk about it maybe just in men's group maybe from the pulpit we'll see but if you look at the statistics for men versus women and what they're looking at on the Internet it's probably astounding the women the women look is what I'm saying now is she a prostitute not by her husband vow to her body but before God she has got an evil prostitute Spirit on her do we have this is it broken and knoweth it not 1965 is it working paragraph 78 says now she she is a prostitute not by her husband vow to her body but before God she has an evil prostitute Spirit on her that makes her dress like that and she's in the leodan church age and and don't know that she's doing that the innocent woman don't know that God will judge her for a prostitute this is no joke brothers and sisters we look around the world we can talk about the world we want to see Souls saved from the world but I want to guard the flock I want to make sure we don't have any viruses creeping into to the church he says there you are you get it to her you can't tell her there's no way of getting it to her the Bible said they're naked and they don't know it if you would call her a prostitute personally she would have you arrested or slapped I'm throwing that in there she would I never talk personally about anybody me either I talk about Sin unbelief I don't say this certain Church Mr so and so there Reverend so and so no no I say that the doctrine of that see the whole thing together I don't call individual it's not the individuals it's the system therein it's the world's system and typically I would say it's what we're feeding on Look Away to Jesus brothers and sisters put away the trash get rid of the movies get rid of the social get rid of all of the worldly influence and and focus on the word of the Living God questions and answers sorry I'm going over time here uh just so you know I'll I'll wrap up by 12:30 full stop is that okay amen questions and answers 1964 brother bradam in paragraph 283 he says question should a Christian woman wear simple jewelry as necklaces and Pearls talking about dos and don'ts we're not preaching dos and don'ts neither was brother brandham he says well sister I know means a lot to you and it means a lot to for me for you to place your confidence I i' tell you the truth now remember the Bible said when you Adorn do not adorn with costly jewels and pearls and all kinds of wearing of jewelry but let that be the adorning of a piece and quiet and meek Spirit which I just quoted which of great is of great price before the Lord I love how brother brandham says this here because I know of people in the message that have actually gotten into a big deal over this very topic which is so ridiculous if you just read what the prophet said here he goes on to say now I don't mean by that sister that if you had a pin now this is me not the Lord if you had a pin that you wanted to wear or a little necklace your husband give you or maybe your something like that you wore now to me I don't think that's bad period I don't think that's bad I think that's so good to hear now that's just me now remember I make myself clear that's my opinion and I know there's people that will say well I've got a stronger opinion about that I've got a greater Revelation you got a greater revelation of the Prophet greater Revelation higher more Pious Revelation than the seventh angel messenger but I think it's the approach to it just like anything what's our attitude but I think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it see it's the motive behind it and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing Alone brother bradam says if you got a question about anything don't do it amen and if you struggle with something what does he say he says do the Opposites hey I want to say it if high heels are appealing to you wear low heels if wearing tight clothing is appealing to you wear loose clothing if wearing bright clothing is appealing to you well try wearing muted clothing in color just do the Opposites and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone but I think you wore but I think if you wore your wedding ring it's interesting if you wore your wedding ring now I know Nazarene people it used to be that you wouldn't even baptize a woman with a wedding ring on see I don't believe that is necessary take it completely overboard right in the the Bible they wore wedding rings only it was a tablet they called it around their head nine pieces of a coin in it and we know that the word talks about the woman who dropped the coin and was looking by for it with a candle light before her husband came home because if he came home and found her without a coin missing the coin meant that she was a prostitute that's a whole story we won't go too far any further with that if a woman want to dress and make themselves look decent clean ladylike why I think there's not a thing to that to me but when you get to go to put that thing into making it a little pride then you're wrong it's your attitude and you know I I would say it this way if there's anything that the word from the prophet said today or anything that is said here that that causes an upset I want to say why does it cause an upset brothers and sisters it's so subtle brother Bram said it I said it it's no joke we're going to stand at the Judgment bar one day and account for our actions I would not want to stand before God and and find out that there was man or woman looking upon me in the age in which I lived upon and I kind of had some sort of a prideful idea in My Mind by the clothes that I wore or or or how I wore them that it would cause people to actually sin could you imagine being that person we will actually be judged for our actions there but remember it's that subtle out of all the beasts in the world all the beasts of the field which one was the most subtle that serpent the devil that one and you know brothers and sisters I just want to say this as encouragement maybe we'll call the musicians because I'm I'm serious we're going to end by 12:30 but you know brother bradam says that the woman that would present herself that way is POS possessed by an evil prostitute Spirit maybe she's not possessed by an evil prostitute Spirit maybe she's afflicted by an evil prostitute Spirit maybe the brother that wants to present himself really tight clothing always trying to show off how physical they are maybe there's something inside of him that's afflicting him too maybe they're not possessed by it but the devil knows there's a little weak spot there and so the devil's going to come around and work that weak spot anybody here have a weak spot anybody know what it's like to have a weak spot worked by the devil that's all it is I'm not saying that we're possessed by the devil and we need to have an exorcism I'm saying that we're all humans we're all Sinners saved by grace and that we do get afflicted by the devil and he's going to do it until the day that we leave this world whether it's by the grave or by the sky it's the way it works I want to say this these people are possibly affected and and you know it's our duty I would say the people who are preaching the people who believe it's our duty it's our responsibility to make sure sure that we're training up children in the way they should go so they know we're going to be accountable for our children husbands we're going to be accountable for our wives preachers we're going to be accountable for all the people that we preach to are we preaching this word the way the prophet brought it this is a standard that's the highest standard out of all the ages we've got all of the standard together as one the only way that we're going to be able to do it brothers and sisters is to apply the token the only way you're going to be able to apply the token is to get it you've got to get the token if we don't get the token you can never apply the token the prophet said take that token and hold it over your prayers if you've got something where the devil's afflicting you with hold that token over your prayers and the devil has to move cuz you've already paid your fair no he's already paid your fair and you've got that to to prove that he's already paid it and the devil can't stay he has to move maybe stand with me as we close today let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just love you and we thank you for your goodness thank you for your Tender Mercies Lord thank you for your word thank you for the standard that you gave us in the day in which we live Lord to know that we won't be without excuse father every single one of us will give an account for our lives and our behaviors and father I pray that Lord you would forgive me for my behavior Lord oh Father my Folly I know that Lord outside of your grace I'm a skunk and father I just pray that Lord that Grace that we heard walked in and pleaded our case at the beginning of the service Lord I pray that we could remember that Grace Lord as we go forwards in our lives Lord and that we wouldn't lord judge ourselves harshly if we have a situation in our life but that we would just turn from our ways that we would just make an adjustment in our lives Lord and line up with your word father Lord let that be our desire even if we stumble and fall oh Father what's our desire let our desire be unto you that you are the Lord Of Our Lives father that there's nothing that we want to do without first getting your approval for because that's what Lord means you're overall father we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands Lord as we go our separate ways father we pray that you would just watch over us brood over us father as a hen over her chicks father Lord Jesus help us to get under your wings quickly father we know that your your Prophet was here one day and and he threw a rock up into the air oh Father And you told the brothers through him that judgment was about to strike and he told them all get under something right quick father help us to get right under your token right now while we have the opportunity we know that in the message the token or maybe in the message anyways your Prophet said that by the time we recognize it it's going to be too late father we love you and we thank you we just want to commit every one of us in our ways unto you today as we go our separate ways we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true there's a race that I must run there are victories
