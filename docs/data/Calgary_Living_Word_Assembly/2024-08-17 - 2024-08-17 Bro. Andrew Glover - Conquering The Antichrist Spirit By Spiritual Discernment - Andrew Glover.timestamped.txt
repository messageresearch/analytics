[44:37] sure to give thee all the praise all the
[44:39] honor and all the glory in the wonderful
[44:42] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[44:45] we pray and all the Believers says amen
[44:49] amen and amen God bless you tonight the
[44:51] book of First John the 4th chapter I
[44:53] want to begin reading here in the first
[44:55] verse the Bible says beloved believe not
[45:00] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[45:03] they have whether they are of God
[45:07] because many false prophets are gone out
[45:10] into the world Amen now hereby know ye
[45:13] the spirit of God every spirit that
[45:16] confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
[45:18] the flesh is of God and every spirit
[45:22] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ
[45:24] has come in the flesh is not of God now
[45:27] this is that Spirit of antichrist
[45:29] whereof ye have heard that it should
[45:31] come and even now already is in the
[45:34] world but ye are of God little children
[45:38] and have overcome them because greater
[45:41] is he that is in you than he that is in
[45:44] the world they are of the world
[45:47] therefore speak they of the world and
[45:50] the world heareth them so those that are
[45:52] of the world speak according to the
[45:54] world and the world hears them because
[45:57] they actually belong to the world but we
[46:00] are of God and he that knoweth God
[46:03] heareth us and he that is not of God
[46:06] heareth not us now hereby know we now I
[46:09] want you to notice here we're not
[46:11] guessing but hereby know we the spirit
[46:15] of truth and the spirit of error we ask
[46:19] the Lord this evening to add the
[46:20] blessing to the reading of his word as
[46:22] you may have your seats here tonight I I
[46:24] want you by the help of the Lord for
[46:26] just a few moment moments if I could
[46:28] amen if I would take a title tonight I
[46:30] want to speak to you on Conquering the
[46:32] Antichrist Spirit by spiritual
[46:35] discernment Conquering the Antichrist
[46:38] Spirit by spiritual discernment now we
[46:41] read there in 1 John chapter 4 and verse
[46:43] one where John says he says now beloved
[46:47] believe not every Spirit but try the
[46:50] spirit whether they of God because many
[46:53] false prophets are gone out into the
[46:56] world now when you look here at this
[46:57] word try it actually means to prove or
[47:00] to discern it means to test to examine
[47:04] it means to scrutinize to see whether a
[47:06] thing is genuine or not now when you
[47:09] actually speak of this word trying you
[47:11] can actually take it to actually
[47:13] precious metals and that actually means
[47:15] to recognize amen as genuine after
[47:19] examination it means to prove or to deem
[47:22] worthy so when you actually try
[47:24] something amen or you discern it or you
[47:26] Pro prove it what you're doing is you're
[47:28] actually seeing if it's actually real
[47:31] amen or if it's false now brother brand
[47:33] preaches very uh two very powerful amen
[47:36] uh wonderful sermons on the subject of
[47:38] discernment Amen in 1959 he preaches a
[47:42] sermon called Discerning the body of the
[47:44] Lord how many has ever heard that sermon
[47:45] amen Discerning the body of the Lord
[47:47] then he comes and follows that up in
[47:49] 1960 and preaches the sermon called
[47:51] discernment of spirit so he actually
[47:53] says we are to discern amen the body of
[47:56] the Lord but then we are to discern the
[47:59] spirit amen that is motivating those who
[48:01] are actually members or are claiming to
[48:03] be amen members of the body of the Lord
[48:06] now amen he actually makes some very
[48:08] powerful statements in those sermons and
[48:09] I just want to read a few of them to you
[48:11] Amen in 1959 Discerning the body of the
[48:14] Lord he says now our Eternal destination
[48:17] amen is not altogether determined by
[48:20] what we see amen and what we hear but it
[48:23] is determined on what discernment we
[48:25] have amen of what we see and of what we
[48:28] hear again he says there we need
[48:30] discernment see amen we need the
[48:32] Discerning by the word amen the word is
[48:36] right how many can agree tonight that
[48:37] the word amen is right the word is right
[48:41] see amen so take the word amen because
[48:44] God's word is always right regardless of
[48:48] what you're looking at or regardless of
[48:50] what you're hearing amen what the word
[48:52] says about what you're seeing and what
[48:54] the word says about what you're hearing
[48:56] is right regardless amen of what the
[48:59] world thinks about it what religion
[49:01] thinks about it amen the word of God is
[49:04] the absolute and did his right in
[49:06] Discerning the body of the Lord again he
[49:08] says now we cannot discern by what
[49:10] people think amen what intellectual
[49:12] tells us or what psychiatrists tell us
[49:15] amen we got to go amen by What God Says
[49:18] see man shall not live by bread alone
[49:20] but by every word amen that proceedeth
[49:23] out of the mouth of God he said now not
[49:26] deserve turning the Lord's body and many
[49:28] are weakly and sick amen and many are
[49:31] asleep amen see they are dead
[49:33] spiritually dead amen because the last
[49:36] plague that hits the Earth amen is
[49:38] spiritual death y'all remember amen the
[49:41] last plague that hit Egypt was death
[49:43] right amen then the last plague that
[49:45] will hit the church is spiritual death
[49:47] he said what we need today is a
[49:49] spiritual awakening amen A Spiritual
[49:52] Awakening to discernment amen now watch
[49:55] this a prophet is not say Amen believe
[49:58] every spirit and follow every Spirit but
[50:00] rather he's saying try the spirits and
[50:03] prove whether they are of God or whether
[50:06] they are of the devil another place she
[50:08] says we have an order from God how many
[50:10] believes
[50:11] that we have an order from God Amen and
[50:15] it is for the Discerning amen of the
[50:18] spirit amen the trying of the spirit he
[50:20] said I believe that is a very great
[50:22] lesson for the church today amen is to
[50:24] try the spirit of anything
[50:27] amen so don't believe the spirit of
[50:29] everything amen but try the spirit of
[50:32] everything amen see have discernment of
[50:35] the spirit now when you look here at
[50:37] that word discernment amen it is the
[50:39] ability to judge well Amen in Christian
[50:42] context it is perception Amen in the
[50:45] absence of judgment with a view Amen to
[50:48] obtaining spiritual guidance and
[50:50] understanding now in 1 John chapter 4 I
[50:53] find it very amazing that John says amen
[50:56] beloved believe not every spirit amen
[50:59] but he says try the spirits now amen
[51:01] John actually uses the word spirit amen
[51:04] as plural which means there's going to
[51:06] be more than one amen but let's just go
[51:08] ahead and say what a prophet said he
[51:10] said but there's really only two Spirits
[51:13] amen so there's more than one amen but
[51:16] there's not more than two amen now you
[51:18] say preacher how can you say that amen
[51:20] because the prophet said one of them is
[51:22] God's holy spirit amen and the other one
[51:25] is the devil spirit amen that is working
[51:28] in deception amen and the people of the
[51:31] Earth are now amen making their choice
[51:34] see the holy spirit is here and he's
[51:37] calling out a bride for Christ how is he
[51:40] doing it amen by vindicating his Word of
[51:43] Promise to her amen for this age amen
[51:46] showing that it is Christ if it is a
[51:49] finger supposed to move the finger will
[51:51] move if the foot is supposed to move
[51:53] amen the foot will move if the eye is to
[51:55] see amen the eye will see amen the
[51:58] spirit of God as it is grown into the
[52:01] full stature of God Amen is the age that
[52:04] we are now living in he said see the
[52:07] holy spirit is here and he is
[52:10] vindicating the message of the hour the
[52:12] holy spirit is doing this so that the
[52:15] people amen that believe God will be
[52:18] called out amen of this chaos now how
[52:20] many can agree that the world is full of
[52:23] chaos amen Leia is full of Chaos chaos
[52:27] amen America and Canada and every nation
[52:30] amen is full of chaos amen but there is
[52:32] a spirit of of God that has come among
[52:35] the church amen to call us out of the
[52:38] chaos amen that we may walk in the light
[52:40] of the word amen and not stumble in the
[52:43] darkness of leosia listen it's the
[52:45] devil's Unholy spirit and he is here
[52:48] amen how is he calling his church amen
[52:51] he's calling his church by error amen is
[52:54] it okay to preach tonight is that okay
[52:56] amen he's calling his church by error so
[52:59] God is calling a church amen by
[53:02] vindicating the word amen and the devil
[53:04] is calling the church amen by taking the
[53:07] word and tur it into error as usual by
[53:10] perversion of the word of God Amen like
[53:13] he did at the beginning he said now see
[53:15] it coming right back Amen to that seed
[53:18] time again amen from Eden here it is
[53:22] again so we've actually gone all the way
[53:25] from Eden amen Back to Eden which in the
[53:28] first Eden was the was the seeds Amen in
[53:31] infancy but in this time amen what was
[53:34] in infancy has now come into maturity
[53:37] amen and the two trees that was in the
[53:39] garden amen symbol one symbolizing
[53:42] God the other one symbolizing the devil
[53:46] he said now see everything in the Earth
[53:48] today amen is traced back Amen to those
[53:51] two trees amen every spirit in the Earth
[53:55] today amen is traced all the way back to
[53:58] those two trees which was one the tree
[54:00] of knowledge of Good and Evil and the
[54:02] other was the tree of life now brother
[54:04] says this in the church age book he said
[54:06] now the second thought that must be
[54:08] impressed on our hearts is that the
[54:10] seven Church ages amen started out with
[54:13] the Antichrist Spirit as well as the
[54:15] Holy Spirit who is to be blessed forever
[54:19] amen the the seven Church ages began
[54:22] amen by the Antichrist Spirit but it
[54:25] also began with a holy Spirit now John
[54:27] says there in first John he says there
[54:29] are many false prophets that are gone
[54:32] out into the world how many knows in
[54:34] Matthew 24 and 24 it said there shall
[54:36] arise amen there shall arise many false
[54:39] Christ and false prophets and shall show
[54:42] great signs and wonders in so much amen
[54:45] that if it were possible amen they shall
[54:48] deceive the very elect amen so there you
[54:50] see the devil Spirit of error amen
[54:53] working in deception that if it was
[54:55] possible
[54:56] it would deceive the very elect brother
[54:58] B comes along in the church AG book and
[55:00] says thus at this very moment we are in
[55:03] the complete fulfillment of Matthew
[55:07] 24:24 right we're not coming into it
[55:10] we're already in it and who it is that
[55:13] shall attempt to deceive the very elect
[55:15] amen why the spirit of antichrist Amen
[55:18] in the false anointed ones of this last
[55:20] day he said these false ones have
[55:22] already come in jesus' name claiming
[55:25] they have been anointed of God for the
[55:27] last day amen they are false Messiahs
[55:30] amen anointed ones they claim they are
[55:32] prophets amen but are they one with the
[55:34] word never they have added to or taken
[55:37] from it amen no one denies that the
[55:40] spirit of God Amen manifesting in gifts
[55:42] is upon them but like balam they all
[55:45] have their programs they make their
[55:47] appeal for money they exercise their
[55:49] gifts amen but they deny the word or
[55:52] bypass it for fear amen that a
[55:55] controversy might be their chances amen
[55:57] for greater gain yet they preach
[55:59] salvation and deliverance through the
[56:01] power of God Amen just like Judas amen
[56:04] with a Ministry imparted by Christ but
[56:07] because they are our wrong seed amen
[56:10] then consequently they have a wrong
[56:12] spirit amen motivating them so to every
[56:15] seed amen there is a spirit behind that
[56:18] seed he said see religious oh my they
[56:21] outshine the elect in effort and Zeal
[56:24] but it is lay out of sin it is not of
[56:26] Christ see for it looks for big crowds
[56:28] big programs amen startling signs
[56:30] amongst them listen they preach the
[56:33] second coming of Christ amen but they
[56:35] deny amen the Advent of the Prophet
[56:38] messenger though power and signs and
[56:40] true Revelation amen he Eclipse them all
[56:43] yes this false spirit in the last day is
[56:46] so close to the real that it can be
[56:49] distinguished only by its deviation from
[56:51] the word and wherever it called in being
[56:53] anti- it falls back on the one argument
[56:56] amen we have already shown to be false
[56:59] but we get results don't we amen so we
[57:02] have to be of God let me say results
[57:05] amen is not the sign amen of vindication
[57:08] of the spirit of God re said like this
[57:11] he said well they say well our churches
[57:12] of the Lord he said we're growing by
[57:14] Leaps and Bounds brother said I read in
[57:16] the newspaper this morning amen that
[57:18] prostitution is at the highest
[57:20] percentage it's ever been in the nation
[57:22] he said see so growth is not the sign
[57:25] amen God is with a move amen but the
[57:28] word being fulfilled in the power of the
[57:31] authority of the Holy Ghost amen is a
[57:34] direct evidence that God Amen is with
[57:36] the church now amen I believe that Jesus
[57:39] said in this last in time he said the
[57:41] two Spirits would be real close together
[57:43] again right amen the two Spirits would
[57:46] be real close together again now like it
[57:49] was two trees amen they stood side by
[57:52] side in the Garden of Eden is that right
[57:54] amen now notice it will be closer amen
[57:57] than that was so in the last days you
[58:00] all imagine Eve amen as she's walking
[58:02] through the garden amen and there's the
[58:04] tree of life there's the tree of
[58:06] knowledge and God has said do not
[58:07] partake of the tree of knowledge right
[58:09] amen so they're walking through the
[58:11] garden here these two trees amen are
[58:13] standing side by
[58:16] side now catch this brother B says in
[58:18] the last days he said the spirits will
[58:21] be closer than the trees were now think
[58:25] about that you are in the last days and
[58:27] he said oh children God have mercy upon
[58:29] us it would be so real to it would
[58:31] deceive amen the very elected if
[58:34] possible he said now how do we tell it
[58:36] in them days how are you going to tell
[58:38] it today amen the same way you stay with
[58:42] the word Jesus Christ is the same
[58:44] yesterday today and forever now I
[58:47] believe sometimes that we as Christians
[58:49] amen I believe that we forget what we
[58:52] should remember and I believe we
[58:54] remember what we should forget that's
[58:56] good now I believe all I believe we all
[58:59] need reminders from time to time in St
[59:02] John 14: 26 Jesus said amen that the
[59:05] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[59:08] the father will send in my name amen he
[59:11] shall teach you all things and he will
[59:13] bring all things to your remembrance so
[59:15] the spirit of Truth amen will come among
[59:18] the church as the comforter and he will
[59:20] bring all things to your remembrance
[59:23] amen whatsoever I have said unto you in
[59:25] this discernment of spirit brother said
[59:27] who did it amen Christ said that the
[59:29] revelation of God the Holy Spirit would
[59:32] bring it to you a little while and I'll
[59:34] leave you but I'll pray the father and
[59:36] he'll send you the comforter and will
[59:38] bring these things to your remembrance
[59:40] now listen is that right amen that's
[59:43] what he's doing this morning and well
[59:45] what what will he do amen he will show
[59:48] you things to come see the holy spirit
[59:51] in the church amen in the last day so
[59:54] the holy spirit in the church in the
[59:56] last day amen is here to do more amen
[59:59] just make us shout or just make us dance
[1:00:02] amen or just make us feel good amen but
[1:00:05] the Holy Ghost has come into the church
[1:00:08] amen to reveal amen the word of God in
[1:00:11] the age that we're living in that's why
[1:00:13] God would send a prophet Amen to remind
[1:00:16] the church amen in 1 John 4 he said do
[1:00:19] not believe every spirit amen but try
[1:00:22] the spirits I love this quote you all
[1:00:25] know it by heart and the revelation of
[1:00:26] Jesus Christ he says now remember this
[1:00:29] amen I love how he says that now amen
[1:00:32] remember this he says Christ in the true
[1:00:35] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:00:37] Acts amen but the Book of Revelation
[1:00:40] shows amen how that the Antichrist
[1:00:42] spirit amen would come into the church
[1:00:45] and would defile it making it lukor
[1:00:47] formal and Powerless see it exposes
[1:00:51] Satan revealing his works and the
[1:00:54] attempted destruction amen of God's
[1:00:57] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:00:59] word amen right down to the time that he
[1:01:02] is cast into the Lake of Fire amen he
[1:01:05] fights that he cannot stand it because
[1:01:08] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:01:11] Revelation here it is amen if the people

[1:06:41] times we are in perilous times we are
[1:06:44] not looking for the last days we are in
[1:06:47] the last days I say we are living in the
[1:06:49] L of sin age amen which according to the
[1:06:51] prophet of God and the word of God is
[1:06:54] the most decept
[1:06:56] age that's right it's the most deceptive
[1:06:59] age of all Seven Ages now you all
[1:07:02] remember the part of God talks about
[1:07:04] Martin he says how that Martin was there
[1:07:06] and he said this Angel come to him and
[1:07:08] he said when this Angel come he came
[1:07:09] with a gold crown and he had shoes
[1:07:11] golden shoes inl and he was all golden
[1:07:14] up and he said now here Martin he said
[1:07:16] I'm your lord he said Fall Down and
[1:07:18] Worship me remember said he said that to
[1:07:20] him about two or three times he said but
[1:07:22] then all of a sudden amen Martin
[1:07:24] remembered that Christ did not promise
[1:07:26] to come like that he said see Martin
[1:07:28] took it to the word he said see you got
[1:07:30] to stay on the word amen because the
[1:07:33] great battle is at hand you got to stay
[1:07:36] on the word because the great battle is
[1:07:39] at hand he said we played church for
[1:07:41] years amen but the hour has come now
[1:07:43] that when Janice and jambers will with
[1:07:45] send Moses as the Bible said they would
[1:07:48] amen it's going to be a spiritual battle
[1:07:50] amen a conflict they'll just be continue
[1:07:52] on Amen the denominational Church just
[1:07:55] move right on into denomination and go
[1:07:57] on the way it does but I mean the real
[1:08:00] True Believer amen is coming to the
[1:08:03] battlefield listen how many real true
[1:08:05] believers amen have I got here tonight
[1:08:07] amen then a real True Believer is not
[1:08:09] following denomination amen into
[1:08:12] denomination a real True Believer is not
[1:08:14] following end time signs amen into more
[1:08:17] confusion but a real True Believer has
[1:08:20] come to the Battlegrounds of the
[1:08:22] spiritual warfare the final showdown
[1:08:24] amen between Christ and the Antichrist
[1:08:27] and they're standing on the word of God
[1:08:29] and they're defeating the devil amen not
[1:08:31] by the way they feel not by the way
[1:08:33] things are going not by the things way
[1:08:35] things are looking they are defeating
[1:08:37] the devil amen by spiritual discernment
[1:08:40] of the word of God to say this is God
[1:08:43] and this is God and this is God and
[1:08:45] that's the devil and we refuse to follow
[1:08:48] any trick or any device or any scheme of
[1:08:51] hell that's
[1:08:53] right come on the real True Believer is
[1:08:57] coming to the battlefield you'd better
[1:08:59] be first and know what you're doing or
[1:09:02] you could take on an evil
[1:09:05] spirit you could take on an evil spirit
[1:09:08] so easy and not know see if it's
[1:09:11] contrary to the word then don't you
[1:09:15] believe
[1:09:16] it now come on Church how hard is
[1:09:21] that hello how hard is that if it's
[1:09:26] contrary to the word right then don't
[1:09:29] believe it see you stay with that
[1:09:37] word now let me ask you this in the last
[1:09:39] days what it going to take to stand well
[1:09:42] the prophet of God said it's going to
[1:09:44] take a scriptural trained Church on the
[1:09:46] line for there's going to be carnal
[1:09:49] impersonations rise now I love this
[1:09:51] because the prophet breaks it down very
[1:09:53] beautiful and he says see many people
[1:09:55] they open their hearts to the wrong
[1:09:56] thing he said now you get a spirit all
[1:09:58] right but many times it contradicts the
[1:10:01] word and they'll say things like the
[1:10:02] days of Miracles is passed there's no
[1:10:05] such a thing as that amen remember are
[1:10:08] you hearing me remember that's a devil
[1:10:11] under the disguising of Christianity God
[1:10:14] help us when we get down to this after a
[1:10:16] bit that you'll see it's an evil spirit
[1:10:19] in the disguising of Christianity but it
[1:10:22] isn't the spirit of Christ because the
[1:10:25] spirit Spirit of Christ comes to the
[1:10:26] word every time he cannot deny his word
[1:10:31] listen Church what is his word amen his
[1:10:33] word is his voice and John said in 10:27
[1:10:37] Jesus speaking my Sheep amen they hear
[1:10:40] my voice and I know them and they follow
[1:10:44] me listen the Sheep don't follow what
[1:10:46] the world says they don't follow what
[1:10:48] the church says they don't follow what a
[1:10:50] man says they don't follow what the Pope
[1:10:53] says or what a bishop says or what the
[1:10:55] Cardinal says hey if you are a sheep you
[1:10:58] will only follow what the word says amen
[1:11:01] because the word is your absolute see
[1:11:03] how will the people believe him amen
[1:11:06] unless they're constantly in the word he
[1:11:08] said now how he shall appear in the last
[1:11:10] days is to bring the people back to the
[1:11:13] word amen so that the bride will know
[1:11:16] her husband will know her mate the
[1:11:18] revealed word listen church if you are
[1:11:21] the bride you are not married to a
[1:11:23] preacher you are not married to a
[1:11:24] prophet you are not married to an
[1:11:26] influential man you are married to the
[1:11:28] word of God and you follow the word on
[1:11:31] your good days you follow the word and
[1:11:33] on your bad days you follow the word
[1:11:36] when you feel like it you follow it and
[1:11:37] when you don't feel like it amen because
[1:11:40] you're married to the word you have eyes
[1:11:43] for no other you have ears for no other
[1:11:45] you have a heart for no other yes sir we
[1:11:49] are pound to this word by the grace of
[1:11:51] God we are to be the children of light
[1:11:54] amen amen
[1:11:56] we are to be the children of light and
[1:12:00] the light is the word which is made
[1:12:03] light for this age how do we know light
[1:12:07] except it comes from the word amen the
[1:12:09] word made flesh the word made flesh is
[1:12:13] the light of the age when you see
[1:12:18] it now in the church age book remember
[1:12:21] the pro of God says that Revelation amen
[1:12:24] will show how the Antichrist Spirit
[1:12:25] would come in the church the framework
[1:12:27] of the Christian church and would defile
[1:12:29] it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:12:31] Powerless amen now watch what the
[1:12:33] prophet says he says we might as well
[1:12:35] face it the churches are cooling
[1:12:39] off well we just might as well face it
[1:12:42] the churches are cooling off he said see
[1:12:45] more preaching is being done than ever
[1:12:46] in the world and less practice than we
[1:12:49] ever did in all the world now listen I
[1:12:51] believe though that though we are in
[1:12:53] this world we are not of the world world
[1:12:55] I believe that Leota age amen is the age
[1:12:59] of the Turning time in the sil the
[1:13:01] Antichrist he says now to my opinion
[1:13:03] this is the age of the Turning time it's
[1:13:06] a time when men are either will come
[1:13:08] into the kingdom of God or they will be
[1:13:11] sealed out of the kingdom of God listen
[1:13:13] you're either going to be in Christ or
[1:13:15] you're going to be out of Christ and
[1:13:17] then there is no in between he said I
[1:13:19] believe that the Antichrist seals a
[1:13:21] person we're taught in the scripture
[1:13:22] Revelation 9 If any man receives his
[1:13:26] seal or his Mark or the letter of his
[1:13:29] name is doomed amen is sealed out of the
[1:13:32] kingdom of God and the spirit of Christ
[1:13:34] when Once sealed with that is sealed in
[1:13:37] the kingdom of God and just as sure as
[1:13:39] you can be sealed out with one you can
[1:13:41] be sealed in with another and tonight
[1:13:44] we're going to talk about now listen
[1:13:45] what the prophet says amen the sealing
[1:13:48] out and he says tomorrow about the
[1:13:50] ceiling in amen so there's two ceilings
[1:13:52] taking place there's a ceiling out amen
[1:13:55] but there's also a sealing in he said
[1:13:57] and you draw your own opinion as I try
[1:14:00] to keep it strictly on the word amen not
[1:14:02] opinions but the word now let's just go
[1:14:04] ahead and break it down real simple amen
[1:14:06] the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God that
[1:14:10] seals a man into Christ and seals the
[1:14:13] devil out Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not
[1:14:16] the spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[1:14:19] until the day of your Redemption listen
[1:14:21] this is not a temporary seal this is not
[1:14:24] a church seal
[1:14:25] this is an eternal seal when a man once
[1:14:29] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:31] on his soul it'll sealing for Time and
[1:14:34] Eternity it'll seal the world out and
[1:14:36] it'll seal caught in listen I tell you
[1:14:38] what we need to do is we need to start
[1:14:40] preaching the Seal of God again and quit
[1:14:42] preaching psychology and quit preaching
[1:14:45] relaxing sermons and trying to hug well
[1:14:48] I might as well preach I'm here amen
[1:14:50] relax the atmosphere amen and get a
[1:14:52] little warm fuzzy feeling I say preach
[1:14:54] the fire of God Amen till the Holy Ghost
[1:14:57] comes to the church and burns out
[1:14:59] lukewarmness it burns out L come on we
[1:15:01] might as well preach or here amen some
[1:15:04] folks are getting little lay out of
[1:15:05] seeing amen and church is becoming
[1:15:07] optional the house of God is becoming
[1:15:09] optional amen going to church is only
[1:15:11] when we can make it amen I tell you what
[1:15:13] that is amen it's lay out of sea and
[1:15:16] it's creping the church even around the
[1:15:18] ranks of this
[1:15:21] message well we might as well preach and
[1:15:23] then we got parents putting their kids
[1:15:25] in sports and missing the house of God
[1:15:27] for ball games oh God come on somebody
[1:15:31] amen it's lay to seea amen we got Sports
[1:15:34] and televisions and everything else amen
[1:15:36] coming right back in our homes it's
[1:15:38] because somewhere somebody quit
[1:15:41] preaching that there's a seal in the
[1:15:43] church that can seal the devil out and
[1:15:45] can seal a Revival
[1:15:48] in I tell you what a seal does according
[1:15:51] to the Bible amen a seal will place
[1:15:53] someone Beyond doubt
[1:15:55] the direct definition of sealed amen is
[1:15:58] beyond doubt amen so ye are placed
[1:16:01] Beyond doubt until the day of your
[1:16:04] Redemption when you receive the Seal of
[1:16:07] God upon your life the Seal of God
[1:16:10] places you Bey on the doubt of the devil
[1:16:13] Bey on the confusion the listen I think
[1:16:15] it's time to move Beyond amen just going
[1:16:17] to church and paying our ties and
[1:16:20] singing a few songs and put some money
[1:16:22] in the offering amen and fellowship a
[1:16:24] little bit I think it's time to move
[1:16:26] into a place with God where we can walk
[1:16:28] unconscious of doubt we can walk
[1:16:30] unconscious of fear we can walk
[1:16:32] unconscious of unbelief come on Church
[1:16:35] we're not church members we are end time
[1:16:37] Believers and we're not at a picnic

[1:16:42] sword in our hand the captain of the
[1:16:44] host of the Lord is among the church I

[1:16:58] been a season to believe hey now is a
[1:17:01] season to believe the word has returned
[1:17:04] to the church in Purity in thority and
[1:17:07] in
[1:17:10] reality Hallelujah I'm talking about a

[1:23:35] be a prophet not a prophetess though in
[1:23:38] the age are more women according to give
[1:23:40] God's revelation than men but in the

[1:24:56] children
[1:24:58] amen
[1:25:00] back to the faith of the fathers now you
[1:25:02] all know you can read it when you get
[1:25:04] home Revelation 5 you will read there
[1:25:06] that there says there is a book and that
[1:25:08] book is closed right but in Revelation
[1:25:11] 10 it says the book that was closed is
[1:25:14] now open now watch what the prophet says
[1:25:17] he said in Revelation 107 the great
[1:25:19] mystery of the
[1:25:21] book was to be unfolded by the seventh
[1:25:25] Angel's
[1:25:27] message so the seventh Angel's message
[1:25:30] is the unfolding of the mystery in the
[1:25:33] Great Book see what is that when the
[1:25:35] seals are broken The Mystery of the book
[1:25:38] is revealed can I say this to you amen
[1:25:41] Revelation is something that is made
[1:25:43] known of something are you with me amen
[1:25:46] Revelation is something that is made
[1:25:49] known of something it's not something
[1:25:51] you made up it's not something you Pro
[1:25:54] long enough until you thought this
[1:25:56] sounds good about this scripture No
[1:25:58] Revelation is something amen that is
[1:26:00] made known of something can I say this
[1:26:03] and the Revelation is closed until the
[1:26:05] last days but Malachi 4 will come and he
[1:26:09] will restore the revelation of the
[1:26:11] church and the very first revelation
[1:26:13] he's going to restore is that I am the
[1:26:16] Lord and I change not and he goes to
[1:26:18] Hebrews 138 and says that Jesus Christ
[1:26:21] is the same amen yesterday to today and
[1:26:24] forever he says that is the Keystone of
[1:26:27] the Bible it is the Revelation amen that
[1:26:30] God never changes and that his ways are
[1:26:33] as unchangeable as he is amen can I just
[1:26:36] shout it to you tonight everything
[1:26:38] changes except God and his mind about
[1:26:42] his word listen politics are changing
[1:26:45] denominations are changing schools are
[1:26:47] changing religion is changing people's
[1:26:50] changing jobs everything is changing but
[1:26:53] you ought to be able to lift your hand
[1:26:55] and say thank God there is an
[1:26:57] unchangeable God there is an unchanging
[1:26:59] way there is a Vindicated method there
[1:27:02] is a reality of Jesus Christ among the
[1:27:04] church and here it is he's the same
[1:27:08] yesterday
[1:27:10] today and
[1:27:12] forever are you hearing me he's the same
[1:27:15] yesterday today and forever you say
[1:27:17] you're talking about a prophet lot I am
[1:27:19] it's Malachi 45 and 6 behold I will send
[1:27:23] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:27:25] of the great Dreadful day and he will
[1:27:26] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:27:30] faith of the fathers lest th come and
[1:27:32] smout the Earth with a curse now I know
[1:27:34] somebody somebody say well heyen excuse
[1:27:37] me that was John the Baptist okay tell
[1:27:39] me one

[1:27:43] the Baptist restored he did not he
[1:27:46] turned the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:27:48] children but according to Malachi 4
[1:27:50] there's got to come a message that will
[1:27:52] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:27:54] fathers listen friends amen so God would
[1:27:57] send a prophet who was born underneath a
[1:28:00] pillar of fire which was the same Pillar
[1:28:02] of Fire that was with Moses that was
[1:28:04] with Paul amen has returned in this age
[1:28:07] and he stood on platforms around the
[1:28:08] world and listen over and over he says
[1:28:11] this Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:28:14] today and forever listen he was not
[1:28:17] standing there amen preaching in Easy
[1:28:20] atmospheres he was standing there
[1:28:21] preaching in cold amen iCal atmospheres
[1:28:25] that were Bound by the spirits of error
[1:28:28] Bound by the spirits of unbelief but he
[1:28:30] stood there and he said but I come here
[1:28:31] to say this Jesus Christ is the same
[1:28:35] yesterday today and forever if he ever
[1:28:38] saved he's still saving if he ever
[1:28:41] healed he's still healing if he ever
[1:28:43] gave the Holy Ghost he's still giv the
[1:28:45] Holy Ghost if he ever raised the dead
[1:28:48] he's still able to raise the dead if he

[1:29:08] seminary a school a
[1:29:11] library a
[1:29:13] lecture he got it in the Bible that's
[1:29:17] right now I love what he says so we
[1:29:21] really
[1:29:22] believe that God never changed his mind
[1:29:25] about what he said he always keeps it
[1:29:31] true I want you to think about something
[1:29:34] a Prophet come among the church in an
[1:29:36] age where the spirit of error had people
[1:29:39] reading Mark 16 reading about the Widow
[1:29:42] of na son we reading about the Blind
[1:29:45] barus and about Gus's daughter the
[1:29:48] spirit of error literally had people
[1:29:50] reading those scriptures and saying this
[1:29:53] well the days and miracles are
[1:29:56] passed yeah exactly hello right reading
[1:30:01] the word of God and saying the days of
[1:30:03] Miracles are passed can I say something
[1:30:05] to you what it is is its Eve's
[1:30:10] interpreter returning among the church
[1:30:14] in the false interpretation of the word
[1:30:16] of God a few years ago brother brother
[1:30:19] Shawn Martin our pastor there in
[1:30:20] Virginia Amen brother Shawn Martin and
[1:30:22] maybe some of you know brother Sean amen
[1:30:24] we were out doing some meetings in
[1:30:25] Pennsylvania and we were there and there
[1:30:27] was a brother uh who host those meetings
[1:30:29] and he ran at a campground and so
[1:30:31] brother Sean was sitting on his porch
[1:30:32] one day and there was a guy sitting
[1:30:34] there I think it was maybe a uh I want
[1:30:37] to say maybe Church of Christ or Church
[1:30:38] of God something like that anyhow amen
[1:30:40] the the there was a cabin next to
[1:30:42] brother Sean's and there's a guy sitting
[1:30:43] on his porch and while he's sitting on
[1:30:45] his porch brother Shawn comes out and he
[1:30:47] says hey he says I see you all in our
[1:30:49] Campground for the week and he said yes
[1:30:51] sir he said well I got a question for
[1:30:53] you he said said what do you all believe
[1:30:55] brother Sean said well he said we're
[1:30:56] Full Gospel people we believe in all the
[1:30:58] Bible he said we believe in the
[1:31:00] revelation of Jesus Christ he said we
[1:31:02] believe that God sent a prophet and he
[1:31:03] said we believe in the in the power of
[1:31:05] revelation we believe in the power of
[1:31:06] Miracles he said we we believe in the
[1:31:08] Supernatural so here's a guy that sits
[1:31:11] there sitting on his porch he been
[1:31:12] believing that he's a Christian and he
[1:31:14] says these words he says you know I
[1:31:16] don't believe in the
[1:31:19] Supernatural he says I don't believe in
[1:31:21] all that Miracles and stuff he said now
[1:31:22] what do you he said now how do you all
[1:31:24] base that he said well if you brother
[1:31:26] Sean says if you're reading the Bible
[1:31:27] amen that in the Old Testament there was
[1:31:29] Miracles Amen in the New Testament there
[1:31:31] was Miracles he said so we believe that
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:31:36] and forever now brother this is amazing
[1:31:38] to me is the man looks at brother Sean
[1:31:41] and he says you really believe Hebrews
[1:31:43] 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:31:45] yesterday today and forever he said yes
[1:31:48] sir I do he said do you realize that
[1:31:50] that scripture don't even make place or
[1:31:52] don't even make sense where it's
[1:31:54] chronologically placed in the Bible he
[1:31:56] said have you ever read Hebrews 13
[1:31:59] brother son said yes he said have you
[1:32:00] ever read how this man asked him he said
[1:32:03] have you ever read how you're reading
[1:32:04] about all these social duties and
[1:32:06] spiritual duties and about marriage and
[1:32:08] then all of a sudden right there Amen in
[1:32:11] the middle of all that it says Jesus
[1:32:13] Christ amen is the same yesterday
[1:32:15] forever and then he says it picks right
[1:32:16] back up he said do you realize that
[1:32:18] historians and theologians have proved
[1:32:21] amen that Hebrews 13:8 is out of place
[1:32:24] in the Bible therefore it's not relevant
[1:32:27] to today I said my goodness and then
[1:32:31] this guy claiming to be a Christian
[1:32:33] claiming to be a follower of God is
[1:32:34] saying that God put something in his
[1:32:36] word that's out of order out of place
[1:32:39] and is not relevant to today you know
[1:32:41] what I I got to think about that brother
[1:32:42] Sean told me about it he said I looked
[1:32:44] at the man and I said well sir you've
[1:32:46] come too late to tell me that he said
[1:32:48] because do you see my daughter amen
[1:32:50] walking through the campground he said
[1:32:52] an was born without a hip socket he said
[1:32:54] she was up for a surgery he said but the
[1:32:56] Holy Ghost came by and we laid our hands
[1:32:59] upon her he said and God the Creator put
[1:33:02] a hip socket he said you'll see her this
[1:33:04] weekend amen she's not crippled amen
[1:33:07] she's walking on two good
[1:33:10] legs he said this entire Campground amen
[1:33:14] it's full of Miracles it's full of
[1:33:17] manifestations of the supernatural amen
[1:33:20] I got home and I got to ponder that
[1:33:21] brother Barry and ponder that and
[1:33:22] thinking about it amen How could
[1:33:24] somebody amen say that that is out a
[1:33:26] place well then I got to studying
[1:33:28] brother brandham and brother br's going
[1:33:29] along and he says now Paul wrote some
[1:33:31] powerful letters he said he wrote the
[1:33:33] Romans and the Corinthians and the
[1:33:34] Ephesians he said but to my Revelation
[1:33:37] he said the book of Hebrews is Paul's
[1:33:39] key
[1:33:41] letter I said oh God Amen he said it's
[1:33:44] Paul's key letter then I go to the
[1:33:45] church age book and he said here is the
[1:33:48] Keystone of the entire Bible that
[1:33:50] Hebrews 138 is Jesus Christ same
[1:33:54] yesterday today and forever I thought oh
[1:33:56] God Amen he's connecting Hebrews 138
[1:33:59] Amen to a key well then I went to a
[1:34:02] sermon called a key to the door and B
[1:34:04] says these words he says if you need a
[1:34:06] key it's because the door is locked and
[1:34:09] he said there's something on the other
[1:34:10] side of the door amen that's worthwhile
[1:34:13] he said but what you do is you lock the
[1:34:15] door amen and you give somebody a key to
[1:34:18] unlock the door and to go into what is
[1:34:20] worthwhile
[1:34:24] I said Oh Glory to God I got to thinking
[1:34:26] amen any of y'all ever left your house
[1:34:28] and maybe somebody coming by or they're
[1:34:30] going to go in and check on the water
[1:34:32] check on the animals amen and what you
[1:34:33] do amen is you go hide a key underneath
[1:34:36] a rock or underneath a mat or underneath
[1:34:39] a bush or something amen now listen when
[1:34:41] you have that key amen sister Susan you
[1:34:43] don't go walking through the
[1:34:44] neighborhood saying hey hey everybody
[1:34:46] I'm leaving town amen I'm leaving my
[1:34:49] house I'm going away for two weeks
[1:34:51] there's a key underneath the match if
[1:34:53] you want to go in the
[1:34:55] key no you don't tell the entire
[1:34:58] neighborhood because that key is not for
[1:35:01] the entire neighborhood it's for one
[1:35:04] predestinated
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:06] person it's for one person that you have
[1:35:10] chosen to go into your house so what you
[1:35:13] do is you call them on the phone and you
[1:35:16] secretly tell them where the key is you
[1:35:19] say it's underneath the mat it's
[1:35:21] underneath the rug it's underneath a
[1:35:23] rock amen and they go get the key as a
[1:35:26] chosen one and they go into to what is
[1:35:28] locked behind the door I got to thinking
[1:35:30] about that amen here is theologians and
[1:35:33] they're trying to probe into Revelation
[1:35:35] they're trying to probe into the
[1:35:36] mysteries of God they're trying to probe
[1:35:38] into the Rapture they're trying to prob
[1:35:39] and into all these things amen but they
[1:35:41] don't have the key amen but God sends a
[1:35:44] prophet a simple Hill belly born in the
[1:35:47] hills of Kentucky and he walks behind a
[1:35:49] pull pit and says Church here's where
[1:35:51] the key is
[1:35:55] it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:58] same yesterday today and forever listen

[1:37:08] God has many phases to it I believe
[1:37:10] church is a work of God missionary is a
[1:37:12] work of God evangelist is a work of God
[1:37:15] but Above All Soul Saving is the works
[1:37:17] of God Amen Divine Healing is the works
[1:37:19] of God the gifts of the Spirit is the
[1:37:21] work of God it could be talked on many
[1:37:23] different Outlets but listen but Healing
[1:37:26] The Sick is not the sign of the Messiah
[1:37:29] for the prophets healed the sick before
[1:37:31] the Messiah come and in this last days
[1:37:33] Healing The Sick in this great Revival
[1:37:35] Divine Healing is not one of the
[1:37:36] outstanding signs of the coming of Jesus
[1:37:39] for we've had Divine Healing through
[1:37:42] 2,000 years right amen since the going
[1:37:47] way of the Messiah at Pentecost or
[1:37:50] Jerusalem and the r return of him again
[1:37:52] but there was a sign can I can I have
[1:37:55] your attention there was a sign that was
[1:37:58] the sign of the Messiah and the closing
[1:38:01] of the age so the the Messiah sign
[1:38:05] appears at the closing of the age so in
[1:38:08] the last days or the closing of the age
[1:38:11] amen The Works of God and the works of
[1:38:14] the devil are going to be revealed 1
[1:38:16] John 3:8 see he that committed sin is of
[1:38:19] the devil for the devil sinth from the
[1:38:21] beginning for this purpose purp the Son
[1:38:24] of God was manifested for this purpose
[1:38:27] was the son of God manifested that he
[1:38:29] might destroy the works of the devil so
[1:38:33] the Son of God was manifested that the
[1:38:36] works of the devil might be destroyed
[1:38:38] look at this word destroyed it means to
[1:38:43] loose it means to let go from bondage so
[1:38:47] the works of the devil had gripped
[1:38:49] Humanity but the manifestation of the
[1:38:52] son of God was the destroying of the
[1:38:54] works of the devil Christ was manifested
[1:38:57] to destroy the works of the devil is
[1:39:00] that right you believe that what was he
[1:39:02] God's word which destroys the works of
[1:39:05] the hybrid the devil he was done to do
[1:39:07] that he was born to be that Amen to
[1:39:10] destroy the works of the devil how many
[1:39:13] will raise your hand and agree that
[1:39:15] Jesus Christ the son of God was born to
[1:39:18] destroy the works of the
[1:39:20] devil he was born to destroy
[1:39:23] The Works of the devil now can I say
[1:39:25] this a prophet turns a corner and says
[1:39:28] now his body is to do the
[1:39:31] same now you raised your hand that he
[1:39:34] was born amen but now can you raise your
[1:39:36] hand and say but I was born as well Amen
[1:39:40] to destroy the works of the devil listen
[1:39:43] somebody's going to destroy cancer
[1:39:45] somebody's going to destroy depression
[1:39:48] somebody is going to destroy the
[1:39:49] Antichrist Spirit somebody is going to
[1:39:52] destroy Le
[1:39:54] somebody is going to tear down the
[1:39:55] devil's
[1:39:58] Kingdom he was born now he is born his
[1:40:02] body do the same because the head and
[1:40:05] the body is together that's right if
[1:40:08] Christ is the head hallah which was the
[1:40:11] word then his body has to be the same
[1:40:14] thing as his head
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:18] was so his head will not be Victorious
[1:40:22] and his body
[1:40:24] defeated his head will not have
[1:40:26] authority and his body be walking under
[1:40:29] under guessing but if the head was
[1:40:31] Victorious then the body will be
[1:40:33] victorious if the head was an overcomer
[1:40:36] then the body will be an overcomer if
[1:40:39] the head was the word come on church if
[1:40:42] the head was the word then the body will
[1:40:45] be the word as well see a church of the
[1:40:48] word born of the word he said not denom
[1:40:53] now virgin born from the word the way
[1:40:56] the body operates is by the head now
[1:41:00] says this and you all know this there
[1:41:01] were three pools right there was the
[1:41:04] first pool which was healing there was
[1:41:06] the second pool which was prophesied
[1:41:09] which broke out into a discernment right
[1:41:12] but then there was a third pull which
[1:41:14] was the opening of the word the
[1:41:17] revealing Mysteries if there's any
[1:41:18] questions amen you'd be glad to talk to
[1:41:20] me or brother Barry amen we we're not
[1:41:22] just making these things
[1:41:24] up says the Holy Spirit giving the gift
[1:41:27] of going forth of discerning spiritual
[1:41:29] things now listen they come through
[1:41:31] healing everybody shouted at the healing
[1:41:32] right you you go on YouTube or go on on
[1:41:34] Wikipedia and read about the prophet and
[1:41:36] they say my he was big in healing he was
[1:41:38] a he was the forefather he was the uh
[1:41:41] the uh one of the uh founding fathers of
[1:41:43] the he healing campaign revivals broke
[1:41:45] out in the 40s and the 50s Amen in the
[1:41:47] 60s amen now you watch they all rallied
[1:41:49] around the healing remember the sign in
[1:41:51] the hand amen God bless you brother
[1:41:53] murin good to see you amen amen they
[1:41:55] rallied around the the sign of the hand
[1:41:57] amen but then he goes from the sign of
[1:41:59] the hand to the deser of spirit and he
[1:42:02] could stand on a platform and tell
[1:42:04] people what they were thinking what they
[1:42:06] had been through what color of hair the
[1:42:08] kid had what type of doctor was talking
[1:42:10] am because he broke into that
[1:42:12] furtherance of the ministry and so now
[1:42:14] they said man God was with him in the
[1:42:16] healing now let's go in the prophesying
[1:42:19] under the discernment he said but there
[1:42:21] was something greater coming he said see
[1:42:23] there was a third pull which would be
[1:42:25] the open of the word of the revealing
[1:42:26] Mysteries he said now listen you went
[1:42:28] forth with me in the discernment of
[1:42:30] spirit and things he said but now it's
[1:42:32] come to the place where I want to tell
[1:42:33] you the truth about things right oh God
[1:42:36] so under the third pull is where he
[1:42:39] begin to tell the truth about marriage
[1:42:41] and divorce under the third pull is
[1:42:44] where he told the truth about MDC under
[1:42:47] the third P come on church amen under
[1:42:49] the first and second pull he preached
[1:42:51] Revelation 61 and2 as the Christ amen
[1:42:54] the white horse rider but under the
[1:42:56] third pole is where his spirit of God
[1:42:58] corrected him and he said it's not the
[1:43:01] Christ it's the Antichrist he said see
[1:43:03] so what was it it was the son of man
[1:43:06] which is Christ the head returned at the
[1:43:09] Clos of the age or at the changing of
[1:43:12] dispensations to identify the body by
[1:43:15] Revelation listen your pull was not the
[1:43:17] first pull your pull was not the second
[1:43:20] pull but your pull was the third pull
[1:43:23] which was made known under the opening
[1:43:25] of the word the revealing of the son of
[1:43:29] man can you prove that by the Bible Luke
[1:43:32] 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day
[1:43:35] when the son of man is revealed brother
[1:43:38] says revealed or made known see the son
[1:43:41] of man Ministry may say the son of man
[1:43:44] Ministry it can only go to a certain
[1:43:47] type of people he said you understand
[1:43:50] why a Ministry like this can't go to the
[1:43:51] full can only go to the Full Gospel
[1:43:52] people
[1:43:53] when something struck my heart I had
[1:43:56] discernment that that was the word of
[1:43:58] God he made it manifest amen there's a
[1:44:02] revelation written in Mysteries like
[1:44:04] this to the outside world to the world
[1:44:05] knows nothing about it but you precious
[1:44:08] Brethren and you precious sister you are
[1:44:11] not children of the darkness you're not
[1:44:13] Children of the Night you're Children of
[1:44:15] the light walking in the light as he is
[1:44:16] in the light then we have Fellowship one
[1:44:18] with another can I can I say this to you
[1:44:21] amen walk in the light is his like
[1:44:23] listen then we have Fellowship one with
[1:44:25] another while the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:27] God's son cleanses us all our
[1:44:31] sins there you are you are Servants of
[1:44:36] the
[1:44:37] Lord try the
[1:44:40] spirit now I'll say this to you in
[1:44:43] closing and maybe we'll pick it up in
[1:44:44] the morning the seventh age is a very
[1:44:46] busy
[1:44:47] age it's an age when both spirits will
[1:44:51] be revealed
[1:44:53] and will be
[1:44:55] manifested in other words it's the time
[1:44:58] when the spirits will be revealed
[1:45:01] they'll be made known but there'll be
[1:45:03] somebody on the earth to discern
[1:45:06] them in other words the time has come
[1:45:10] that the devil can no longer get away
[1:45:12] with doing what he wants
[1:45:14] to for years he ran free yes for years
[1:45:18] he did what he wanted to do come on now
[1:45:22] he taught what he wanted to taught teach
[1:45:24] right he promoted what he wanted to
[1:45:26] promote but in the end time underneath
[1:45:29] the message of Malachi
[1:45:31] 4 Revelation 10 Luke 17 the word would
[1:45:37] be restored to the
[1:45:41] church spiritual discernment would come
[1:45:44] back can I say this to you y'all got y
[1:45:47] all got your your table at go listen to
[1:45:48] them we are he he preaches the great
[1:45:50] warrior David one night follows it up
[1:45:52] with the great warrior John Joshua I'm
[1:45:54] going to get on Joshua in the morning
[1:45:55] maybe Lord willing but I want to close
[1:45:56] on David he says there's David he says
[1:46:00] David was a warrior he was elected
[1:46:03] chosen anointed and placed he said now
[1:46:07] listen he said there were Goliath he
[1:46:10] said now if there are goliaths then
[1:46:13] there are some
[1:46:14] Davids if there are goliaths then there
[1:46:17] are some Davids now I want you to
[1:46:19] remember what he said he said the
[1:46:21] Antichrist Spirit would come in the
[1:46:22] church church and would defile the
[1:46:24] church would make it lukewarm cold
[1:46:27] formal and Powerless right would make it
[1:46:31] formal cold lukewarm and powless he said
[1:46:34] but God's spirit would come to the true
[1:46:37] people who had true Revelation and they
[1:46:40] would discern can I say this they would
[1:46:43] discern
[1:46:45] and amen amen hallelujah
[1:46:49] withstand so we're not just Discerning
[1:46:52] the spirit but we're actually
[1:46:54] withstanding the spirit somebody say
[1:46:56] what do you mean well David walked out
[1:46:58] there and he said who is this
[1:47:00] uncircumsized
[1:47:02] philistin that would defy the armies of
[1:47:05] the Living God do you know the problem
[1:47:07] of God said right there David discerned
[1:47:08] Goliath he identified that the spirit
[1:47:11] motivating this man was a was a devil to
[1:47:14] defy the Living God but you know what
[1:47:16] David didn't do he didn't walk out there
[1:47:19] and say oh there's there's Goliath and
[1:47:21] he's come to defy the armies of the and
[1:47:23] cross his arms and go back in and sit
[1:47:24] down and say somebody go fight him no
[1:47:27] David discerned him David judged him
[1:47:30] David scrutinized him David examined him
[1:47:34] David proved that the spirit behind
[1:47:36] Goliath was a spirit from the pits of
[1:47:38] hell and he said listen I will not lay
[1:47:41] down and let this uncircumcised
[1:47:43] Philistine amen defy the Living God you
[1:47:46] know what David done when he said he's
[1:47:49] an uncircumcised Philistine he discerned
[1:47:52] Goliath but when he went over there and
[1:47:53] got his slingshot and he picked up five
[1:47:56] smooth Stones Hallelujah he picked up
[1:47:59] five smooth Stones he is no longer just
[1:48:01] Discerning Goliath he's now withstanding
[1:48:04] Goliath he's now saying listen here
[1:48:07] buddy you've defied the wrong remember
[1:48:09] said those words fell on the wrong ears
[1:48:12] he said David picked up five smooth
[1:48:14] Stones he said he got that slingshot and
[1:48:16] he be to sling it you know what I love I
[1:48:19] love what the prop of God said he said
[1:48:21] David danced his way amen R into the
[1:48:24] battle come on David didn't stand there
[1:48:26] and walk with his head down David didn't
[1:48:29] walk in there depressed David didn't
[1:48:31] walk in there confused he walked in
[1:48:33] there as a warrior he walked in there as
[1:48:35] an overcomer brother said he danced his
[1:48:37] way amen right into the battle listen
[1:48:40] David knew Goliath was going to fall
[1:48:42] before he slung one stone he knew
[1:48:44] Goliath was coming down before he slung
[1:48:47] one Stone Church of the Living God I
[1:48:49] think it's time to put our dancing shoes
[1:48:51] on I think it's time to quit running
[1:48:53] from the battle I think it's time to S
[1:48:55] crying over the battle I think it's time
[1:48:58] to dance right into the face of the
[1:49:00] Antichrist spirit with an anointed
[1:49:02] Revelation and say you chose the wrong
[1:49:04] group
[1:49:06] devil you chose the wrong Church we're
[1:49:09] not here believing every Spirit we have
[1:49:12] received a keystone we can discern the
[1:49:16] spirit
[1:49:18] hallelujah hallelujah that Goliath's got
[1:49:21] to come down
[1:49:24] that Goliath has got to come down what
[1:49:28] are you saying preacher I'm saying this
[1:49:31] conquer your
[1:49:34] Goliath you now have the
[1:49:38] Revelation to do it the two Spirits are
[1:49:41] close but greater is he that's in
[1:49:44] you amen amen than he that's in the
[1:49:48] world let our musicians come tonight I
[1:49:50] believe it I believe both Spirits have
[1:49:51] been revealed
[1:49:53] amen I believe both Spirits have been
[1:49:56] revealed the spirit of God and the
[1:49:59] spirit of the
[1:50:01] Antichrist I believe the spirit of God
[1:50:04] is here calling his
[1:50:05] church how by
[1:50:08] vindicating the promised word of the age
[1:50:13] we're living
[1:50:14] in how's the devil calling his church by
[1:50:18] the spirit of error but hereby know we
[1:50:21] the spirit of God amen hereby know we
[1:50:24] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[1:50:29] error can I just say this to you the
[1:50:32] Antichrist was dreading the time of the
[1:50:35] seventh angel that's right because
[1:50:37] Daniel said thou old Daniel shut up the
[1:50:39] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:50:41] of the end for many shall run to and fro
[1:50:45] and
[1:50:46] knowledge shall be
[1:50:48] increased listen knowledge shall be
[1:50:51] increased another other words they're
[1:50:53] going to run to and fro and knowledge is
[1:50:55] going to increase but there will be no
[1:50:58] Authority by the word to defeat the
[1:51:02] Devil but when a prophet comes among the
[1:51:05] church he goes over in the Bible and he
[1:51:07] finds the
[1:51:09] Keystone he finds the
[1:51:12] key Jesus Christ the same
[1:51:15] yesterday
[1:51:16] today and
[1:51:18] forever and you know what he says he
[1:51:20] says and any spirit that contradicts
[1:51:23] that is a seed of discrepancy that's
[1:51:24] right right amen any spirit that says
[1:51:29] Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday
[1:51:30] Dan forever is a seed of
[1:51:33] discrepancy he said now what is
[1:51:35] discrepancy he says it means to say
[1:51:37] something contrary to what's already
[1:51:38] been
[1:51:42] said come on Friends the word of God was
[1:51:44] said years before brother Brandon was
[1:51:47] born brother BR didn't write the
[1:51:50] Bible he come and revealed the Bible
[1:51:52] amen but you know what he did he took
[1:51:54] this Bible right here and he didn't say
[1:51:57] one thing
[1:51:58] contrary to what had already been
[1:52:02] said he said here oh Israel the Lord our
[1:52:04] God is one
[1:52:06] God he said man is saved by the blood
[1:52:11] atonement somebody say well you've lost
[1:52:13] your mind no I had I'm
[1:52:16] dressed right you know why the devil
[1:52:18] hates you it's because you're not just
[1:52:21] talking about your author
[1:52:23] Authority you're wearing
[1:52:29] itall you're not just talking about your
[1:52:32] position you're wearing your Authority
[1:52:35] remember the Bible said that Jesus was
[1:52:37] actually speaking in the temple and the
[1:52:38] scribes and Pharisees were astonished
[1:52:40] remember that they were astonished at
[1:52:41] his Doctrine because they said these
[1:52:43] words they said he spoke as one having
[1:52:48] Authority he spoke as one
[1:52:52] having not looking for having Authority
[1:52:57] I got to looking at that word having one
[1:52:58] day brother Barry and I found the
[1:53:00] definition of it the word having is
[1:53:02] related to one
[1:53:04] wearing I said dear God somebody wearing
[1:53:08] their
[1:53:09] Authority and then I got to thinking
[1:53:11] where the proud of God said these words
[1:53:13] he said oh if I can just get her to
[1:53:15] stand still long
[1:53:17] enough I'll dress
[1:53:20] her I'll dress her in the clothe of the
[1:53:23] word of God y'all remember the book of
[1:53:26] Isaiah I think it's Isaiah 4 and verse1
[1:53:28] the Bible said in the last days there
[1:53:30] would be seven women he said they would
[1:53:32] say these things they would say we'll
[1:53:34] eat our own food we'll wear our own
[1:53:36] clothes he said but we just want your
[1:53:38] name he said to Bear to remove the
[1:53:40] reproach so in other words they didn't
[1:53:42] want to eat spiritual food in due season
[1:53:45] and they didn't want to wear the
[1:53:46] garments of the word they wanted his
[1:53:48] name his authority to remove their
[1:53:51] reproach I got to to studying that one
[1:53:53] day and it dawned on me amen whenever
[1:53:55] you go somewhere amen you got to be
[1:53:57] dressed for the occasion listen amen if
[1:54:00] you go to a ball game you don't go out
[1:54:02] there to play quarterback in a suit and
[1:54:03] tie come on am mean if you go to Rodeo
[1:54:07] am mean you don't go you don't go get on
[1:54:08] a bull and ride a bull Amen in a c or in
[1:54:11] a in a in a a football uniform amen you
[1:54:14] wear the clothes appropriate to the
[1:54:17] occasion listen friends do you realize
[1:54:20] amen that when God robe someone in
[1:54:22] authority
[1:54:23] he changes their
[1:54:25] clothes I want you to catch something
[1:54:27] Isaiah 4:1 they said we'll eat our own
[1:54:29] bread and we we'll wear our own clothes
[1:54:32] but we'll take your name but you realize
[1:54:34] in Luke 15 the Bible says amen that
[1:54:37] there was a prodal come home and the
[1:54:39] Bible says the prodal come home and
[1:54:42] before he went to supper amen the father
[1:54:45] changed his
[1:54:46] [Applause]
[1:54:48] clothes the father said listen bring
[1:54:50] forth the best robe and put a pair of
[1:54:53] shoes upon his feet and put a ring upon
[1:54:55] his hand for this my son was lost but he
[1:54:58] is now found and then they went to
[1:55:03] supper hey before they ate they changed
[1:55:05] their clothes I got to read the
[1:55:07] Revelation the Bible says amen that unto
[1:55:10] her was granted fine linen clean and
[1:55:11] white amen and the fine linen is the
[1:55:13] righteousness of God which is the
[1:55:15] righteousness of the Saints amen they
[1:55:18] changed the clothes and the very next
[1:55:20] lines amen and she went to the married

[1:56:45] happened is
[1:56:47] churches they've put the church above
[1:56:49] the
[1:56:50] word he says but in reality the word is
[1:56:52] above the church that's right so because
[1:56:56] the church says it's okay people say
[1:56:57] it's okay but it don't matter what the
[1:56:59] word
[1:57:00] says but in the last
[1:57:02] days God would hide a
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:07] key when he had Paul writing Hebrews
[1:57:11] Paul underneath the inspiration of the
[1:57:13] Holy Ghost and he's writing about this
[1:57:15] and he comes down to Hebrews 13 13:7 and
[1:57:18] he says let your conversation be this at
[1:57:21] the end of all matters and Paul's
[1:57:24] writing along and he stops him and he
[1:57:26] says Jesus Christ the same
[1:57:28] yesterday today and forever and Paul
[1:57:30] goes right on writing they've debated
[1:57:33] the book of Hebrews for years they've
[1:57:35] argued who wrote it they've argued where
[1:57:37] it come from they've argued if it even
[1:57:38] should be in the Bible or
[1:57:40] not but
[1:57:42] God would send a prophet and he would
[1:57:45] turn over there and he would find it he
[1:57:47] would pull it out and he would say now
[1:57:48] here you go here's your key to the
[1:57:51] rapture
[1:57:53] amen here's your key to the to the
[1:57:55] Millennium thank you Lord Jesus
[1:57:59] Christ and he said you take the church
[1:58:02] and put it under the word don't you put
[1:58:05] the word under the
[1:58:07] church you put the word over the church
[1:58:10] and if it don't line up with God's word

[1:58:14] it you love him
[1:58:16] tonight how many can say Lord give me
[1:58:19] that
[1:58:20] discernment not to stand up and call

[1:58:28] their house and what color no give me
[1:58:31] that discernment Lord to look at
[1:58:34] something and see the
[1:58:37] spirit is it God the Holy Spirit or is

[1:58:45] and brother BR said prove all things he
[1:58:48] said in other words when it's proven
[1:58:50] right hold fast to it he said get a grip
[1:58:52] on it he said don't turn it
[1:58:56] loose he said if it's proven wrong he
[1:58:58] said drop it right
[1:59:00] fast how many tonight could say Lord I
[1:59:03] want to do
[1:59:05] that you know sometimes you get a grip
[1:59:07] on things right and the word of God
[1:59:10] begins to be preached and you got a grip

[1:59:44] spirit of truth but I raise my hands
