[28:22] a rejoicing okay
[28:27] um
[28:28] I would like to thank the Lord
[28:31] for the healing of sister Jermaine I'm
[28:33] sure we all would
[28:36] we want to thank the Lord for the
[28:37] healing of Brother John Charles
[28:40] it doesn't matter what a doctor has to
[28:41] say
[28:43] that's only the scientific version of
[28:45] what's going on
[28:46] but there's so much more because greater
[28:49] is he that is in me
[28:51] than he that is in the world
[28:53] just because a doctor has a diagnosis
[28:55] that doesn't mean anything to a believer
[28:58] I want to thank the Lord for healing
[29:00] brother Mervin and sister Faye
[29:03] I want to thank the Lord for healing

[29:15] brother Phil yeah I'd like to thank the
[29:17] Lord for this
[29:19] you can see this picture here
[29:22] there was prayer requests that went out
[29:24] if you could go back brother Phil
[29:27] or maybe forwards the one with the smoke
[29:30] these are all pictures of what happened
[29:32] last Sunday
[29:35] does this come up on the screen on the
[29:37] internet
[29:38] this is a picture that my dad sent me of
[29:40] his of his uh just in front of his
[29:42] driveway his driveway is directly to the
[29:44] right he has a farm
[29:46] this fire was four miles north of his
[29:49] farm
[29:51] the emergency broadcast signal went off
[29:53] I was sitting at the kitchen table
[29:55] listening to God who is rich in Mercy
[29:59] with my son
[30:02] when we heard this go off
[30:04] and I read what it said there was two
[30:06] wildfires raging east and south of
[30:10] Claire's home and staveley which is
[30:11] directly where my dad's Farm is east of
[30:14] clarison southeast of clarison anyways
[30:18] I said Isaac we need to pray right now
[30:21] and we just thanked the Lord thank the
[30:25] God who was rich in Mercy
[30:27] that if he could just spare
[30:30] dad's Farm
[30:32] and maybe it sounds crazy maybe it just
[30:34] sounds fanatical
[30:36] coincidental
[30:38] that after it was all said and done this
[30:40] was the picture he sent me of the smoke
[30:41] going by four miles north of his farm
[30:46] I want to thank everyone who prayed
[30:49] [Applause]
[30:53] I personally have a hard time thinking
[30:55] that God Almighty would hear my prayer
[30:58] and answer my prayer so I will say I
[31:01] thank everyone for their prayers because
[31:03] it's a many-membered body
[31:06] but if that wind would have shifted just
[31:08] ever so slightly to the southeast
[31:11] you can go on to the other pictures
[31:12] brother Phil you can see what this fire
[31:15] did this was a house this was someone's
[31:17] Farm
[31:19] this was someone's entire place
[31:21] maybe go to the next picture brother
[31:23] Phil
[31:24] I don't know if it will come up if not
[31:26] it's okay
[31:29] it's all right there was a couple other
[31:30] pictures there that one that was another
[31:32] house in behind that one
[31:34] it's just completely gone
[31:36] absolutely gone the fence posts were
[31:38] completely charred
[31:40] it was it would have been a terrible
[31:41] thing to have rolled through but you
[31:44] know that's Satan trying to rob us
[31:47] trying to take what's ours
[31:50] but aren't we so thankful that we have a
[31:53] Word of Promise in our day that he says
[31:55] that he will rebuke the Devourer for our
[31:58] sakes thank you
[32:00] I just can't help but think about this
[32:02] literal thing this literal fire how that
[32:05] can happen in our own lives
[32:07] how the devil will set a fire and then
[32:09] try and fan the flames and just get it
[32:11] to Roar right through our lives
[32:13] but remember brothers and sisters
[32:16] we have power in our prayer
[32:20] he will rebuke the Devourer for our
[32:22] sakes
[32:24] let's just go to him in prayer
[32:26] gracious Heavenly Father how thankful we
[32:29] are Lord Jesus for your tender Mercy
[32:33] Lord Jesus so many times you you come on
[32:36] the scene and you help us in ways that
[32:38] we can't even imagine
[32:41] and father so so many times disaster is
[32:45] right at our very door
[32:48] and you just take it away from us

[33:14] Roar it through that home and through
[33:15] that family and get everyone all worried
[33:18] and shaken up Lord Jesus as a body of
[33:21] Believers we can stand here with the
[33:23] authority of you inside us and say Satan
[33:26] we rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[33:28] Christ of Nazareth

[33:39] that you're just waiting to hear your
[33:40] sons your daughters exercise their

[34:32] out now oh Father we didn't come to hear

[34:39] from you and you alone Lord Jesus and
[34:42] father we know that where you're called
[34:43] upon you never disappoint you always
[34:45] come where you're invited so father we
[34:48] just invite you humbly now
[34:50] in Jesus name we pray amen
[34:55] thank you brothers and sisters if you
[34:56] have your Bibles this morning
[34:59] I want to read from the book of
[35:00] Revelation and then from the book of
[35:02] First Corinthians
[35:09] we have uh
[35:11] a resurrection service this morning
[35:13] an Easter morning service from a little
[35:15] bit of a different perspective
[35:18] trust the Lord will
[35:20] bless it
[35:23] it's kind of the way he's been leading
[35:24] me actually we'll start reading with
[35:26] Revelations chapter 3.
[35:28] verse 19.
[35:36] Revelations chapter 3 verse 19. this is
[35:40] the message to the Church of laodicea we
[35:43] know it's a message to the age in which
[35:45] we live
[35:47] we'll just go ahead and read here verse
[35:49] 19 of chapter 3.
[35:52] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[35:55] be zealous therefore and repent
[35:58] we know that brother Branham says
[36:02] the Zeal of the age is to repent
[36:05] I believe that's where he gets it right
[36:07] there
[36:08] verse 20 behold I stand at the door and
[36:11] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[36:13] the door I will come in to him
[36:16] and will sup with him and he with me
[36:19] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[36:21] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[36:24] overcame and I'm set down with my father
[36:27] and his throne
[36:28] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[36:31] the spirit saith unto the churches
[36:35] verse 4 chapter 1.
[36:38] chapter 4 verse 1. after this I looked
[36:42] and behold a door was open in heaven
[36:45] and the first voice which I heard was as
[36:48] it were of a trumpet
[36:50] talking with me
[36:52] which said come up hither
[36:54] and I will show thee things which must
[36:56] be hereafter
[36:59] and immediately
[37:00] I was in the spirit
[37:02] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[37:05] and one
[37:07] sat on the throne
[37:09] let's turn over to First Corinthians
[37:15] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[37:19] I just love it how it's so crystal clear
[37:21] right there
[37:22] one sat on the throne
[37:25] not two not three
[37:28] not a many-membered body
[37:30] one
[37:33] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[37:38] start with verse 9.
[37:42] for we know in part
[37:44] and we prophesy in part
[37:47] but when that which is perfect is come
[37:51] then that which is in part shall be done
[37:53] away
[37:56] when I was a child I spake as a child
[37:59] I understood as a child
[38:02] I thought as a child
[38:04] but when I became a man
[38:06] I put away childish things
[38:10] this is Paul speaking to the Corinthians
[38:12] now in verse 12.
[38:14] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[38:17] there's that semicolon
[38:20] which is a change in the actual
[38:23] Direction
[38:24] but then
[38:26] face to face
[38:28] now I know in part but then shall I know
[38:32] even as also
[38:34] I am known
[38:36] let's just bow one more time
[38:38] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[38:41] thankful for your word
[38:42] I'm so thankful for the revelation of
[38:44] your word Lord Jesus
[38:47] through a Vindicated prophet
[38:49] so many times so many people must hear
[38:52] those words and think it just sounds so
[38:55] fanatical
[38:56] it sounds so weird
[38:58] but Lord
[39:00] we know that you never operate outside
[39:02] of your word
[39:04] and we know that the children of Israel
[39:06] called upon you to not speak to them
[39:09] anymore and to just send them a prophet
[39:12] to speak to them through Moses so you
[39:15] said all right that's what I'll do
[39:18] I pray Lord Jesus that Revelation would
[39:22] be our Keystone father
[39:23] and Lord we're not talking about the
[39:25] Book of Revelation we're talking about
[39:27] all Revelation that you would just
[39:28] reveal yourself to us a little further
[39:30] today Father Lord that you would speak
[39:33] to our hearts that we wouldn't leave
[39:34] this building the same that we wouldn't
[39:36] leave this meeting the same father that
[39:38] each and every one of us would just be
[39:39] called up hither that each one of us
[39:42] would be called around your throne as
[39:45] we've sung this morning Father we want
[39:46] to be in the heavenlies today we want to
[39:49] see what's going on in heaven we don't
[39:51] want to look around at this Earth father
[39:53] we want to draw that much closer unto
[39:55] you so father we pray that you would
[39:57] just draw close to us according to your
[40:00] word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[40:04] God bless you this morning you may be
[40:05] seated
[40:08] I know it's a real strange kind of
[40:12] scripture to take but
[40:15] you know it is the rising of the Sun
[40:18] brother Branham preached that Easter
[40:20] morning service it is the rising of the
[40:22] Sun and I'm just going to read a little
[40:24] clip from it
[40:25] and uh
[40:27] I just believe it's important
[40:30] he says because I live
[40:32] ye live also
[40:35] speaking to his wife
[40:37] because I live
[40:39] ye live also
[40:42] he says what a resurrection
[40:45] that that was
[40:47] and what a resurrection this is
[40:52] not somewhere from the past
[40:54] the past tense
[40:56] not not 2 000 years ago and brothers and
[40:59] sisters here I go again right into the
[41:01] punch line we're talking about a
[41:03] resurrected Christ today
[41:05] the resurrected Jesus Christ of all ages
[41:09] not somewhere in the past if he's
[41:10] somewhere in the past
[41:12] let us help you bring him to the Future
[41:14] let us help you bring him to the present
[41:16] let us help you just maybe remember that
[41:19] he is the great I am an Ever present
[41:22] tense
[41:24] I am
[41:25] not somewhere in the future not
[41:27] somewhere in the past brother Branham
[41:29] said it very clearly that the church
[41:30] many times wants to put him in the
[41:32] future and and put him in the past and
[41:33] you know I would say this it's not even
[41:35] the church it's Satan coming around and
[41:38] mixing with people messing with their
[41:40] minds twisting words that are spoken out
[41:42] of the Bible and and that are preached
[41:44] even from the prophets through Through
[41:46] the Ages but Satan coming around and
[41:48] mixing it up to get people so balled up
[41:50] that they they they they get so caught
[41:52] up looking at what's going to happen and
[41:53] what's already happened but they ignore
[41:55] what's happening right now
[41:58] we know that when we come into the unity
[42:00] of the faith when we get into one place
[42:03] in one mind and one Accord
[42:06] for real
[42:08] not just something that we say but
[42:10] something that we do
[42:12] and you want to know how you're there
[42:14] I'll say it this way we've said it many
[42:16] times
[42:17] give yourself the test
[42:19] see if someone can come and kick you
[42:22] see if you're a dead man for real
[42:25] can someone come and kick you brother
[42:27] Branham says when you kick a dead man he
[42:29] doesn't even move
[42:30] but many of us are just not dead enough
[42:34] we have to die so that he will live
[42:36] there has to be a resurrection a
[42:39] resurrected Jesus Christ in every one of
[42:41] our lives and how does that happen every
[42:43] single day
[42:44] every single day on our knees Paul said
[42:47] he had to Die daily we have to Die daily
[42:49] we can't have a one and done I'm saved I
[42:52] believe the message of the hour I
[42:54] believed it when I was 13 years old and
[42:55] I'm I'm good now I can just go and live
[42:57] my life any old way that's not the way
[42:59] it works if that's what it is then that
[43:01] is a god of history and we need to
[43:04] change that he has to be the resurrected
[43:06] Jesus Christ in our life right now today
[43:13] what a resurrection that that was
[43:16] and what a resurrection this is
[43:19] to be quickened from the dead
[43:22] to be made alive in Christ Jesus by
[43:25] God's quickening power
[43:28] how do we know if we are alive in Christ
[43:31] Jesus by God's quickening power
[43:34] just just let the devil come around and
[43:36] kick you
[43:37] and see if you're alive
[43:39] and if you are ask the Lord
[43:42] to help you
[43:43] to die out to yourself
[43:46] brother Branham says it that every
[43:47] single Speck of us has to die amen so
[43:50] that he might live
[43:53] I'm not saying that we need to go and
[43:55] kill ourselves and do something weird
[43:56] I'm not talking fundamentally crazy like
[43:59] that I'm speaking by the spirit
[44:01] we need to make sure that the old man
[44:03] doesn't live that we take every single
[44:06] thought that comes into our minds into
[44:07] our hearts into captivity
[44:10] before we speak
[44:12] before we Act
[44:13] maybe just run it through the word maybe
[44:16] just say Lord what would you do
[44:19] you know the word says to do everything
[44:21] as unto the Lord
[44:23] huh
[44:25] it's not easy
[44:26] easier said than done I know it
[44:29] today I want to talk about this this
[44:31] Revelation though
[44:33] and uh all Revelation not just the Book
[44:36] of Revelation but this one portion of
[44:38] the Book of Revelation by Revelation if
[44:40] that makes any sense
[44:42] you know Jesus when he was talking to
[44:44] his disciples
[44:46] and I believe the 70 went away because
[44:49] he said to them unless you eat my flesh
[44:51] and drink my blood
[44:52] you have no part in me and and and many
[44:55] people turned away from him then when
[44:57] they heard that they said this guy is
[44:58] crazy this what is this guy talking
[45:00] about
[45:01] I remember the law in the day back in
[45:04] the day
[45:05] the judaic law the law of Moses there
[45:09] was so many points in there
[45:12] um he was actually speaking directly
[45:13] contrary to the law you're not supposed
[45:15] to talk about blood you're not supposed
[45:16] to drink blood you're not supposed to
[45:17] have any blood in your meat
[45:21] and and let alone eat a human
[45:24] it's crazy when you think about it
[45:26] anyways those people were put off by his
[45:28] words he directly and and purposefully
[45:31] pushed them away
[45:33] just to show that many are called but
[45:36] very few are chosen
[45:38] and speaking by revelation we know that
[45:41] Peter when he asked
[45:43] who who do men say that I am I think I'm
[45:46] getting these mixed up
[45:48] but Peter he had a revelation back when
[45:50] he was talking about this when you if
[45:52] you'll Eat My Flesh and drink my blood
[45:54] and and he said will you go too and
[45:56] Peter said unto whom would we go
[45:59] he had that revelation
[46:02] it was by Revelation that he had that we
[46:05] know the other Revelation that I was
[46:06] kind of mixing in there by accident was
[46:08] uh you know he said who do the people
[46:11] say I am
[46:12] some said you're Elias some said you're
[46:14] a prophet
[46:16] but then he narrowed it down and said
[46:18] who do you say I am
[46:20] and John or Peter he had that Revelation
[46:22] he said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[46:24] the Living God
[46:25] and Jesus told him Flesh and Blood hath
[46:27] not revealed this unto you but my Father
[46:29] which is in heaven hath revealed it unto
[46:31] you and and that's really what we're
[46:32] talking about we're speaking about
[46:33] Revelation it has to be revealed by the
[46:36] spirit to us
[46:38] remember we talked about another church
[46:40] age book it's got to be revealed by the
[46:41] spirit then it's got to be confirmed by
[46:43] the word if you're wondering whether
[46:45] it's some sort of fanatical thought that
[46:47] comes into our head by Satan if you're
[46:49] wondering check it by the word check it
[46:51] by the message of the hour and see if
[46:53] it's of God if it if it lines up with
[46:56] both of those then go on rejoicing
[46:57] because it will bring a manifestation of
[46:59] life
[47:00] but if it doesn't line up with them just
[47:02] leave it alone we just have to leave it
[47:04] alone we don't want to try and make it
[47:05] something it isn't
[47:08] but you know that that that quote where
[47:11] we're not quote but what we were talking
[47:13] about where Jesus had that Revelation
[47:15] told Peter that revelation
[47:19] who do you say that I am
[47:21] it's the same thing today brothers and
[47:22] sisters who do you say that he is
[47:26] he a god of History
[47:28] is the resurrection morning something
[47:30] fancy that happened two thousand years
[47:33] ago
[47:34] or has he come to live
[47:36] and and live out through our lives as a
[47:39] living witness to the people that we
[47:41] encounter and the things that we go
[47:43] through
[47:45] is Jesus just a nice man a god of
[47:47] History you know that there's an age
[47:49] right now on the earth we know this that
[47:52] has no idea who Jesus Christ is
[47:54] he's maybe at best
[48:01] some fairy tale
[48:03] that sort of has something to do with
[48:05] Easter
[48:07] maybe has something to do with the cross
[48:10] but not a resurrected Jesus Christ who
[48:13] is Alive and Well in human beings today
[48:18] he's got to be here with us this morning
[48:20] in US
[48:22] you know this morning I I don't know if
[48:23] it's a title or whatever it's just a
[48:26] thought but I wanted to talk about the
[48:27] resurrection
[48:29] and the life
[48:30] through the cloud
[48:32] today
[48:33] because we have we have the ability to
[48:36] talk about the message of the hour and
[48:38] and see
[48:39] God sent a prophet and all these
[48:42] wonderful great mysterious things that
[48:44] the rest of the world doesn't see
[48:46] but brothers and sisters I want to say
[48:48] this what do we see when we look at the
[48:50] cloud picture
[48:51] I want to I want to talk about the cloud
[48:53] picture today for a bit
[48:55] maybe from just a little bit of a
[48:57] different perspective Lord willing
[49:01] but it has to be a new birth
[49:04] the Revelation to the individual
[49:06] personally
[49:10] you know what was the first thing that
[49:11] Jesus did when he went to the cross
[49:13] when he died
[49:16] when he died he finally gave up his goat
[49:19] gave up the ghost he bowed his head he
[49:21] said it's finished and he bowed his head
[49:22] the very first thing that he did
[49:25] he went right back to the temple
[49:28] he didn't go to heaven he didn't go to
[49:30] hell he went right back into the temple
[49:32] and what did he do he tore the veil from
[49:34] top to bottom and showed them that this
[49:37] is no longer going to be acceptable
[49:38] there is a new way and the Covenant is
[49:41] going to be through Grace the very first
[49:44] thing that he did
[49:45] and you know it was in the temple where
[49:48] they were singing the Praises of Psalms
[49:50] the Praises of David singing about the
[49:53] Messiah and the coming of the Messiah
[49:55] and not realizing that they just
[49:57] crucified him
[49:59] while they were worshiping him they were
[50:01] crucifying him brothers and sisters
[50:03] remember the prophet he preached the
[50:05] sermon the indictment
[50:07] I indict this generation how many
[50:09] generations ago was that
[50:12] I indict this generation for the second
[50:14] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:19] we need to make sure that we understand
[50:21] where we stand how late really is it I
[50:25] say it all the time brother Branham said
[50:26] it in the message the Rapture right at
[50:28] the very beginning it would be
[50:29] astounding for you if I told you just
[50:32] what's really taking place
[50:35] in the message the rapture
[50:38] Jesus went over and he tore the the veil
[50:41] in the temple and said you know what now
[50:42] there's no separation there's going to
[50:44] be an opportunity there's going to be a
[50:46] doorway there's going to be an ability
[50:49] for man to have Fellowship directly with
[50:52] me now you don't have to go through a
[50:53] high priest you don't have to go through
[50:55] all the sanctification process that all
[50:58] of the law of Moses laid out you don't
[51:00] have to go through the temple you don't
[51:01] have to do any of the old
[51:04] worship methods
[51:07] because now there is one and one
[51:11] sacrifice for all
[51:14] but they were they were literally
[51:16] singing about the one they were killing
[51:18] at the moment
[51:21] but isn't it interesting how he just
[51:23] went ahead anyways with his plan
[51:25] he duped Satan Satan didn't even realize
[51:29] it because if he did is what the word
[51:30] says they would never have crucified the
[51:32] Lord of Glory
[51:35] you know brothers and sisters one thing
[51:37] I did want to talk about this morning is
[51:39] the crucifixion
[51:41] how in our day it's so far down the road
[51:44] so many years passed it's all it's
[51:49] almost sensationalized it's almost made
[51:51] to be something that's
[51:53] maybe not quite as terrible as it was
[51:56] you know Jesus was crucified he died for
[51:58] us and rose again and and it's all good
[52:01] but if you take a look at what happened
[52:03] in the crucifixion and I'm not going to
[52:05] go too graphic with it because it's
[52:07] horrible
[52:09] I'll say it this way that they didn't
[52:11] only just kill him
[52:14] but they destroyed him
[52:16] what they did was offered that man Jesus
[52:20] Christ and I'll say it that way because
[52:21] he was a flesh man they offered him the
[52:24] absolute worst
[52:26] possible death
[52:28] available to humankind
[52:33] if you could even imagine that
[52:35] the maximum amount of pain that a POS a
[52:38] human being could possibly endure he did
[52:43] so that we could be here this morning
[52:44] and talk about him
[52:46] that alone for me brothers and sisters
[52:49] just makes it so easy to worship Him it
[52:52] can actually become hard to worship him
[52:53] because you just don't even know what to
[52:55] say how do you say something like that
[52:58] to someone if somebody were to take and
[53:00] say hey you know what I know that you've
[53:02] got a 475 000 mortgage on your home and
[53:05] I know that you're out of work and I
[53:07] know that you're just about to lose your
[53:08] home and I'm gonna I'm gonna just pay
[53:10] off that mortgage for you and I know
[53:12] that you need a car and I know that you
[53:14] need some spending money in your bank
[53:16] and I'm just going to give you another
[53:17] 200 000 cash and I'm gonna give you uh
[53:20] pay off your vehicles everything that
[53:22] you have problems with in this world I'm
[53:24] just gonna fix it up for you
[53:26] in a situation like that it would be how
[53:29] do you even thank a person how do you
[53:31] say thank you to them what do you do for
[53:33] them in a situation like that think
[53:35] about this we were born in this world we
[53:37] came into this world we were born in sin
[53:39] shaped in iniquity came into this world
[53:41] speaking lies and I could never figure
[53:43] that out for the longest time why we
[53:45] just didn't have a hope the reason we
[53:46] didn't have a hope is because we didn't
[53:47] come into this world by the spoken word
[53:50] the original way that God had laid out
[53:52] in the Book of Genesis we came into this
[53:55] world through sex which is not the right
[53:57] way but it's the way that it happened
[53:59] after Eve chose to accept reasoning over
[54:03] God's word over her husband's word
[54:07] because she didn't get it directly from
[54:08] God she got the word from her husband
[54:11] now that's a contentious one right there
[54:13] but it's true she got the word while she
[54:16] was in her husband
[54:18] but to think about it
[54:21] all that Jesus did there it's just
[54:23] difficult to even comprehend I saw a
[54:25] thing that really stimulated my thinking
[54:27] about this and it was a trauma surgeon
[54:29] from today describing crucifixion and
[54:32] what really would have gone on in all of
[54:34] the oh my goodness and this man as he
[54:38] described it he was brought to tears and
[54:39] he said I can't even hardly worship I
[54:41] can't even hardly sing because I know
[54:43] what that means
[54:45] when we talk about the cross
[54:48] but he did that so that we could live
[54:52] he said I am the resurrection and the
[54:55] life
[54:56] and remember the story about Lazarus how
[55:00] he turned up four days late they sent
[55:02] Messengers to him and said your your
[55:04] brother Lazarus your friend your brother
[55:07] he he needs you he needs a touch from
[55:09] you and you're the master you could heal
[55:11] his body
[55:12] and he had to wait he had to just wait
[55:15] and everybody thought where who is this
[55:18] man
[55:18] here his friend is dying he's healed all
[55:20] these other people all these other times
[55:22] people he doesn't even know and now his
[55:24] friend lies sick and he's just going to
[55:25] let him die
[55:27] think about how crazy that sounded but
[55:29] then when he got there and stood before
[55:31] the tomb and he told the sisters hey you
[55:33] know what I am the resurrection and the
[55:36] life don't worry about all these other
[55:38] things that you're looking at just watch
[55:40] what happens now go and roll away that
[55:42] stone and remember they were like wow
[55:45] how could this be he stinks you're crazy
[55:47] do you know what you're doing you have
[55:49] no idea and he said no you have no idea
[55:51] because I am the resurrection and the
[55:53] life
[55:55] my
[55:56] four days late or right on time
[56:00] you know it comes down to that brothers
[56:01] and sisters is the book open or is the
[56:03] book closed
[56:04] is he four days later is he right on
[56:06] time does he give us trials and
[56:09] tribulations in our lives for a purpose
[56:11] and is he just right on time with it all
[56:13] remember we read in the beginning as
[56:15] many as I love I rebuke and I chase and
[56:17] be zealous therefore
[56:19] don't be lukewarm
[56:22] that's the part of the scripture that we
[56:23] didn't read before this
[56:25] because you're lukewarm I'll spew you
[56:28] out of my mouth
[56:30] I would that you were hot or that you
[56:32] were cold
[56:33] but because you're lukewarm I just can't
[56:35] do it
[56:38] so if we're being rebuked and chastened
[56:41] just be zealous
[56:43] be zealous therefore and repent
[56:46] Jesus spoke the words of the tomb of
[56:48] Lazarus I am the I am
[56:52] it was The Great I Am that spoke to
[56:54] Moses that was standing before those
[56:56] people saying I am the resurrection and
[57:01] the life
[57:02] can you imagine that it wasn't him just
[57:04] saying this person you see before you
[57:06] this this man I'm the resurrection of
[57:08] life no it was the voice behind the sign
[57:10] it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was
[57:12] Elohim in
[57:14] flesh it was God speaking and we know
[57:17] that brother Bradham brings out that
[57:18] story so clear that if he would have
[57:20] said
[57:20] come forth the way he said it he would
[57:23] have called the general Resurrection but
[57:25] he spoke his name Lazarus come forth and
[57:29] you know that's the same thing for us
[57:30] today brothers and sisters some people
[57:32] you can see they just haven't had that
[57:34] opportunity they haven't heard the voice
[57:36] of God speak their name to come forth
[57:39] they've hurt many people they've heard
[57:41] come forth but they just haven't heard
[57:43] their name but once they hear their name
[57:45] brothers and sisters there is an
[57:47] inoculation that takes them from heaven
[57:49] or from Earth and puts them right in
[57:51] heaven right where we just read that
[57:53] John immediately he was in the spirit
[57:55] and behold there was a throne set in
[57:56] heaven they're no longer looking at
[57:58] Earthly things
[57:59] they've got their eyes turned Upon Jesus
[58:03] but there comes a point where he says to
[58:06] the individual that I am the
[58:08] resurrection and the life and when that
[58:09] happens that time appointed of the
[58:11] father we are never ever ever the same
[58:14] brothers and sisters never the same
[58:16] I was just reading it last night you
[58:18] know brother Branham someone asking you
[58:20] know how do you know if you've got the
[58:21] Holy Ghost do you really know and and he
[58:23] says it's quite like a woman having a
[58:25] baby you just don't ever forget that
[58:27] something happens in your life and you
[58:31] know if we haven't experienced that if
[58:32] we haven't had that moment where we just
[58:34] know and it might not be a lightning
[58:36] bolt thing where you go from being a
[58:38] rank Center out in the world to being a
[58:40] saint saved by grace
[58:42] it might just be something else where he
[58:44] says you know I want you to pick up your
[58:46] Bible and read this scripture and you
[58:48] just have a scripture coming and coming
[58:50] and coming in your mind and you just
[58:51] can't get rid of it for days even
[58:52] sometimes
[58:54] some of us can be that way speaking
[58:55] myself personally but then when we
[58:58] finally sit down and read that scripture
[58:59] it's his
[59:06] hit to us it's not something just being
[59:07] revealed by the spirit it's actually
[59:09] being revealed by the spirit so it can
[59:10] be confirmed by the word and then when
[59:12] that happens it's that life that starts
[59:15] to take hold in us and it brings forth a
[59:16] manifestation and it's at that point
[59:18] that every True Believer has that
[59:21] experience we can say praise the Lord he
[59:23] spoke to me directly directly he gave me
[59:27] a scripture and that doesn't happen
[59:28] brothers and sisters unless you've got
[59:30] the Holy Ghost
[59:31] I'll say it that way maybe I'm wrong and
[59:34] I'm open for correction if someone wants
[59:35] to but I would say I'm sorry I don't
[59:37] think that everyone has ears to hear
[59:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[59:41] I don't think so
[59:43] if we have that ability to hear from God
[59:45] we need to rejoice
[59:48] you know he said that I will not leave
[59:49] you comfortless
[59:51] I will not leave you come for this I
[59:53] will come to you yet a little while in
[59:55] the world seeth me no more but ye shall
[59:57] see me
[59:58] because I live ye shall live also
[1:00:04] but brothers and sisters we've been
[1:00:05] talking about sort of the history now
[1:00:07] just a little bit about you know the
[1:00:09] resurrection and and the resurrection of
[1:00:11] Jesus and the crucifixion and and the
[1:00:13] resurrection of Lazarus and and the
[1:00:15] words that were spoken there and how we
[1:00:16] need to see it for that but let's just
[1:00:18] bring it to our day in in Revelations
[1:00:20] chapter 10 and and verse one and I saw
[1:00:23] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:00:25] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:00:27] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:00:29] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:00:31] pillars of Fire
[1:00:33] very very very familiar scripture that
[1:00:36] we're reading here this is what I would
[1:00:38] say this is like a keystone scripture
[1:00:40] for the message of the hour this one and
[1:00:42] Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 the message
[1:00:45] Believers the people who are the Eagles
[1:00:47] today the ones that are gathered around
[1:00:49] the carcass this is quintessential
[1:00:51] message words
[1:00:53] verse 2 and he had in his hand a little
[1:00:55] book open and he set his right foot upon
[1:00:57] the sea and his left foot upon the Earth
[1:00:59] and he cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:01:01] lion roarth and when he had cried seven
[1:01:04] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:01:06] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[1:01:07] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[1:01:09] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[1:01:11] up those things which the seven Thunders
[1:01:13] uttered and write them not and the angel
[1:01:15] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[1:01:18] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[1:01:20] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:01:22] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:01:24] that are there and are and the thing and
[1:01:26] the earth and the things that there and
[1:01:28] are and the Sea and the things which are
[1:01:30] therein
[1:01:31] that there should be time no longer
[1:01:34] but here it is
[1:01:37] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:01:39] seventh angel
[1:01:41] when he shall begin to sound
[1:01:43] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:01:45] he hath declared to his servants the
[1:01:48] prophets
[1:01:49] we know that brother brought him
[1:01:52] I would say it in uh sirs is this
[1:01:55] the time of the end
[1:01:57] or commonly referred to by Brother
[1:01:59] Branham is sirs what time is it
[1:02:01] but the official title is sirs is this
[1:02:03] the time of the end
[1:02:05] he talks about all of the Mysteries that
[1:02:08] have been revealed through his ministry
[1:02:10] and he knows something great is coming
[1:02:12] in his life and he thinks it's going to
[1:02:14] be his death he's actually going to die
[1:02:17] and he doesn't realize what it is but
[1:02:19] what it is is a change of his ministry
[1:02:22] we know there was three pulls of his
[1:02:23] ministry and the first poll was
[1:02:26] Discerning of spirits
[1:02:29] taking a hold of someone's hand and
[1:02:30] seeing the the spots form and being able
[1:02:32] to say it's this disease it's this
[1:02:35] disease it's this disease and the second
[1:02:37] one is being able to discern the hearts
[1:02:40] of the people
[1:02:41] first and second polls of his ministry
[1:02:44] and the third one is where they say he
[1:02:46] went off a little bit and this is what
[1:02:48] we're talking about right here this is
[1:02:49] where we live we live in the third pull
[1:02:51] of his ministry I would say that the
[1:02:53] third pull of William bradham's ministry
[1:02:55] that's where they say he went off and
[1:02:57] and it's terrible because people aren't
[1:02:59] giving it the opportunity to see if it's
[1:03:02] actually true they're just saying that
[1:03:03] I'll only look at my traditional
[1:03:04] teachings I'll only stick with my
[1:03:06] denominational words whatever the
[1:03:08] theological school and studies taught me
[1:03:10] that's what I'll believe and that's all
[1:03:12] which is so terrible
[1:03:14] you know when in in the children of
[1:03:16] Israel when they behave that way the
[1:03:18] spirit of God came through the prophet
[1:03:19] and called them stiff-necked and
[1:03:21] uncircumcised people because they don't
[1:03:24] let the spirit speak to them
[1:03:26] we don't want to be that way
[1:03:28] if God has a message for us wouldn't we
[1:03:31] want to hear it
[1:03:32] if he had a message for this day
[1:03:34] wouldn't people want to hear the message
[1:03:36] from God
[1:03:38] but they stumble at the Veil because God
[1:03:40] chose
[1:03:41] man chose
[1:03:43] to have a prophet
[1:03:45] just like man chose to have a king
[1:03:48] when the prophet told him hey you know
[1:03:50] what God is your king and he has led you
[1:03:52] your shoes haven't worn out you haven't
[1:03:54] gotten sick everything has worked out
[1:03:56] for you just flying up until now and now
[1:03:58] you want to be just like everyone else
[1:04:00] all right go on but you know what he's
[1:04:02] going to do he's going to tax you he's
[1:04:04] going to take your sons and your
[1:04:05] daughters and he's going to make slaves
[1:04:06] out of them he's going to rule you with
[1:04:09] the rod of iron and you're not going to
[1:04:10] like it after a while but hey I tried to
[1:04:13] warn you if you want that go for it
[1:04:16] we need to be careful what we ask for
[1:04:18] what we want what we long for we need to
[1:04:20] be hearing what the spirit saith unto
[1:04:23] the church
[1:04:27] so talking about the cloud
[1:04:31] when that which is perfect is come the
[1:04:33] other part of our scripture today
[1:04:36] how many believes the message of the
[1:04:38] hour is perfect
[1:04:41] it's a perfect word
[1:04:43] it's been brought to us and it's been
[1:04:45] Vindicated
[1:04:46] and for those people who have the
[1:04:48] ability to look at it they'll see that
[1:04:50] it's been an open word that this this
[1:04:53] scripture in Revelations 10 verse 7.
[1:04:56] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:04:59] angel messenger when he shall begin to
[1:05:01] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:05:03] finished sirs is this the time of the
[1:05:05] end listen to some of those Mysteries
[1:05:07] that were closed up they mean opened up
[1:05:10] the the Loose Ends is what brother Brown
[1:05:12] I think he called them they were tied up
[1:05:14] he just looked after all the Loose Ends
[1:05:16] so many little things that Satan gets
[1:05:19] into or got into and messed up in the
[1:05:21] denominational worlds over time
[1:05:24] and and and twisted it up got it to a
[1:05:26] place where there was no power of God in
[1:05:28] the church because there everyone was
[1:05:30] off the word
[1:05:32] in First Corinthians 13. you know
[1:05:35] brother Branham he talks about let's
[1:05:36] just turn over there again I just we got
[1:05:39] to read this
[1:05:42] I'm just going to read the chapter
[1:05:45] just to sort of set the background
[1:05:49] chapter 13 of First Corinthians though I
[1:05:52] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[1:05:53] and have not charity
[1:05:56] I want to uh I want to just stop there
[1:05:59] and just say this as we read this
[1:06:03] when we say the word charity
[1:06:05] just take and and substitute Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] because that's what charity is charity
[1:06:11] is love divine love God's own life
[1:06:15] to substitute it and make it holy ghost
[1:06:17] as we read it though I speak with the
[1:06:19] tongues of men and angels and have not
[1:06:21] charity I am become as a sounding brass
[1:06:24] or a tinkling symbol I say Lord help me
[1:06:26] if I'm going to stand here and Minister
[1:06:28] the word let me not be a sounding brass
[1:06:30] or a tinkling symbol I had better have
[1:06:32] the holy ghost in my life and though I
[1:06:34] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[1:06:36] all Mysteries
[1:06:38] and all knowledge and though I have all
[1:06:40] Faith so that I could remove mountains
[1:06:43] and have not charity I am nothing
[1:06:46] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:06:49] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:06:51] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:06:55] me nothing
[1:06:56] charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:07:00] charity envieth not
[1:07:03] charity vaunteth not itself
[1:07:07] is not puffed up
[1:07:09] doth not behave itself unseemingly
[1:07:12] seeketh not her own
[1:07:15] is not easily provoked remember the
[1:07:17] discussion about a dead man is not
[1:07:19] easily provoked
[1:07:21] thinketh no evil Rejoice if not in
[1:07:24] iniquity but rejoiceth in truth
[1:07:28] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:07:30] hope with all things endureth all things
[1:07:33] charity
[1:07:35] never faileth
[1:07:37] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:07:40] shall fail
[1:07:41] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:07:43] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:07:46] shall vanish away
[1:07:49] doesn't matter how many great signs and
[1:07:51] wonders we've got
[1:07:53] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:07:55] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:07:57] come
[1:07:58] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:08:01] away
[1:08:03] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:08:06] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:08:07] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:08:09] childish things
[1:08:11] I'm just going to stop there we'll say
[1:08:12] verse 12 for a little bit I want to talk
[1:08:15] very specifically about the the when
[1:08:17] that which is perfect is come brothers
[1:08:19] and sisters the message of the hour is
[1:08:22] Christ Jesus
[1:08:23] is perfect
[1:08:25] and he's come
[1:08:27] brother Phil if you want to cue that
[1:08:30] that which is perfect is come
[1:08:34] in 1963
[1:08:37] a great event happened
[1:08:42] many people are very familiar with this
[1:08:45] and you know originally the picture was
[1:08:48] actually 90 degrees it was rotated 90
[1:08:50] degrees and brother Bradham he heard the
[1:08:53] voice say to him turn it right
[1:08:55] and once he turned it right he was able
[1:08:58] to actually see what was inside this
[1:09:01] picture
[1:09:02] Life Magazine has produced a picture and
[1:09:05] I didn't show that one maybe I will in
[1:09:07] the future if anybody's interested we
[1:09:09] could show it Life Magazine did a
[1:09:10] picture and it doesn't show his face
[1:09:12] this one was a picture that was done
[1:09:14] with a bit of brown tone and this is
[1:09:17] what was inside it and this is where
[1:09:18] brother Bradham says it in uh
[1:09:21] remember the message now right at the
[1:09:23] end of 65. he says that this is uh you
[1:09:27] can see everything he gives a graphic
[1:09:29] description of the face inside the cloud
[1:09:31] in 1963 I've talked about this off and
[1:09:34] on but I'm going to start drilling down
[1:09:36] as we go forwards here I'm probably not
[1:09:38] done talking about this even in this
[1:09:39] service here but in 1963 when this
[1:09:43] happened
[1:09:44] this wasn't just God coming down like he
[1:09:48] did in the Houston Coliseum with with a
[1:09:50] pillar of fire over top of his man
[1:09:52] vindicating that he is with him and we
[1:09:55] know there's many pictures of the pillar
[1:09:57] of fire that have happened over time
[1:10:00] and and some are are really clearly
[1:10:02] identified and some are a little bit
[1:10:04] vague but many of them have been
[1:10:06] produced and shown but the Houston
[1:10:08] Coliseum is probably the most famous one
[1:10:11] where George
[1:10:13] Lacey is that his name he Vindicated it
[1:10:15] and said that the the light struck the
[1:10:17] lens and and there's there's no way that
[1:10:19] it can lie it doesn't tell psychology
[1:10:21] the camera doesn't have psychology
[1:10:24] the picture in the Houston Coliseum is
[1:10:27] is a very distinctly different picture
[1:10:29] in that it was God vindicating himself
[1:10:32] with his men this one brothers and
[1:10:35] sisters is totally different this is
[1:10:38] what we read in in uh we'll go back but
[1:10:42] in the days in Revelations 10 7 but in
[1:10:45] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:10:46] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:10:48] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:10:51] hath declared to his servants but you
[1:10:53] know if you back up even further
[1:10:55] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:10:58] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:11:00] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:11:02] liveth forever and ever who created all
[1:11:05] things all the things that are and all
[1:11:09] therein are and the earth and the things
[1:11:11] that therein are and the Sea and the
[1:11:14] things which are therein that there
[1:11:16] should be time no longer
[1:11:19] and and it's just a quintessential
[1:11:21] scripture verse for the message of the
[1:11:23] hour but in the days of the voice of the
[1:11:24] seventh angel and he shall begin to
[1:11:25] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:11:27] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:11:28] servants the prophets
[1:11:31] so what I'm getting at this morning is
[1:11:32] thank you brother Phil you can
[1:11:35] take it down the uh what I'm getting at
[1:11:38] this morning is that all of the Loose
[1:11:40] Ends brother Branham came and tidied up
[1:11:43] before 1963 before this happened
[1:11:48] and brother Branham has a quote where he
[1:11:51] says first he doesn't
[1:11:54] and then he reveals it
[1:11:56] and I didn't bring it here I should have
[1:11:58] maybe I'll do it on Wednesday or
[1:12:00] sometime soon
[1:12:02] but to look at this he ties up all the
[1:12:05] loose ends in 1862 and says throughout
[1:12:07] his ministry up until then all of the
[1:12:10] different things that need to be
[1:12:11] straightened out all the doctrinal
[1:12:12] things water baptism women's cutting
[1:12:15] their hair women preachers all the
[1:12:17] different things serpent seed all of it
[1:12:21] he didn't eat fruit in the Garden of
[1:12:23] Eden
[1:12:24] how could man man's fall come from fruit
[1:12:28] in the garden if you really examine that
[1:12:31] that whole story in Genesis if you
[1:12:33] really examine it there's way more
[1:12:34] questions than there are answers
[1:12:37] but once again it's one of those loose
[1:12:40] ends that was tidied up
[1:12:44] when that which is perfect has come
[1:12:49] we can say assuredly that this message
[1:12:52] is perfect
[1:12:54] but that has to come by revelation
[1:12:57] and it doesn't make it an exclusive Club
[1:13:00] all it is is simply asking the Lord to
[1:13:02] show us
[1:13:03] to say Lord I I maybe don't understand
[1:13:05] this but if you could just reveal it to
[1:13:08] me just a little further it might really
[1:13:10] help me
[1:13:12] but you know in verse 11 of of
[1:13:15] Corinthians 13. when I was a child I
[1:13:19] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:13:20] I thought as a child but one became a
[1:13:22] man I put away childish things
[1:13:25] I've been looking at this scripture just
[1:13:26] meditating on it you know I don't
[1:13:28] believe that he's talking about being a
[1:13:30] child here
[1:13:31] he's talking about being spiritually
[1:13:33] immature
[1:13:36] spiritually unrevealed
[1:13:39] spiritually not understanding
[1:13:42] but through growth through the process
[1:13:44] of time through the maturing process
[1:13:47] being taught being fed feeding and
[1:13:51] practicing and learning and
[1:13:53] fellowshipping around the word after a
[1:13:55] while he no longer speaks as a child
[1:13:57] just like Believers we no longer speak
[1:13:59] as children
[1:14:01] we speak as men
[1:14:03] we speak as women we speak as Sons and
[1:14:05] Daughters of God we don't talk about the
[1:14:07] denominational thing talking about how
[1:14:11] Adam and Eve they ate fruit in the
[1:14:12] garden
[1:14:14] I would say that really seriously that's
[1:14:16] childish things when you have seen the
[1:14:18] message of the hour
[1:14:20] you could just type in original sin into
[1:14:22] Google and see what comes up even Google
[1:14:24] knows the answer
[1:14:27] but many people want to turn their back
[1:14:29] on it and say no it's something else no
[1:14:31] it couldn't be that that's what the
[1:14:32] denominational world see
[1:14:34] but you know there's a purpose why there
[1:14:37] was enmity put between the woman's seed
[1:14:39] and the serpent seed and why is there a
[1:14:42] Missing Link in science between Animal
[1:14:44] Kingdom
[1:14:45] and human beings
[1:14:47] why do we think that we I'm not
[1:14:49] preaching to the choir here I know it
[1:14:51] I'm getting looks but you know it's uh
[1:14:54] it's interesting because I know there's
[1:14:56] people listening that maybe don't have
[1:14:57] the full Revelation and and I just would
[1:14:59] like to try and help encourage people to
[1:15:02] just stop and take a look take a little
[1:15:04] bit closer look and just see if God
[1:15:06] won't reveal it to you
[1:15:08] when that which is perfect has come
[1:15:10] brothers and sisters then then that from
[1:15:12] the old can just be put away with we can
[1:15:15] realize that there is a Perfection
[1:15:16] coming and I think that everybody does
[1:15:19] have some degree anyone who would be a
[1:15:21] Christian would have some degree of
[1:15:22] belief that there has to be a time when
[1:15:24] something perfect will come
[1:15:26] whether there's going to be a a death
[1:15:28] burial and Resurrection or or whether
[1:15:30] we're going to be raptured in the sky
[1:15:32] there has to be something better than
[1:15:34] what we're dealing with right now
[1:15:37] but we we read it that charity never
[1:15:39] faileth the Holy Ghost never faileth but
[1:15:42] whether there be prophecies they shall
[1:15:44] fail
[1:15:45] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:15:47] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:15:50] shall vanish away
[1:15:51] there's only one thing that we'll take
[1:15:53] with us that's charity that's the Holy
[1:15:55] Ghost in our lives
[1:15:57] now brother Branham said our character
[1:15:59] is what will go with us and it will but
[1:16:01] what character do we want brothers and
[1:16:03] sisters if we're going to try and take
[1:16:04] this old Badger skin character with us
[1:16:07] we're sadly mistaken because there ain't
[1:16:08] going to be anything on the other side
[1:16:10] except for perfect love which is charity
[1:16:13] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:16:15] when we have fear about any part of it
[1:16:17] remember what the word says that perfect
[1:16:18] love
[1:16:20] casts out all fear not some fear and not
[1:16:23] most fear it casts out all fear we have
[1:16:26] nothing to fear brothers and sisters if
[1:16:28] we've truly been baptized by the Holy
[1:16:29] Spirit we can walk right down into the
[1:16:31] valley where there's the fire just like
[1:16:33] the three Hebrew kids and say you know
[1:16:35] what I don't care if there's a fire here
[1:16:37] it doesn't matter because this isn't
[1:16:38] what God ordained for me I know that I'm
[1:16:40] going to live whether I live in this
[1:16:42] flesh or die in this flesh is irrelevant
[1:16:44] I know that I am an eternal being and
[1:16:46] not one part of me can be lost or else
[1:16:48] one part of God be lost
[1:16:52] it won't work
[1:16:54] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:16:56] part throughout the ages
[1:16:58] the people knew in part and they
[1:16:59] prophesied in part
[1:17:01] but you know we've talked about it many
[1:17:03] times and we'll probably drill right
[1:17:04] down into this in the future there was
[1:17:06] many many prophets in the ages that
[1:17:09] desired to look at this Perfection that
[1:17:11] we're talking about many people long to
[1:17:14] see the coming of the Lord
[1:17:16] and that's really what I'm talking about
[1:17:17] this cloud from 1963
[1:17:20] many people are still singing we we we
[1:17:22] were waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:17:25] but you know what just like we talked
[1:17:27] about very at the very beginning in in
[1:17:29] the crucifixion of Jesus they were
[1:17:31] singing crying out with the Psalms for
[1:17:34] for the Messiah to come and they had
[1:17:35] crucified him brothers and sisters we
[1:17:38] don't want to be like those people I
[1:17:40] want to say it with all my heart look
[1:17:42] what happened in 1963 that wasn't just a
[1:17:45] special time a cloud that happened and
[1:17:47] it just vindicates the message of the
[1:17:49] hour brothers and sisters it's later
[1:17:51] than we think
[1:17:52] if we're still here talking about this
[1:17:54] think about how close we are
[1:17:57] to the resurrection and Rapture we're
[1:17:59] not looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:18:01] we're looking for the going of the Lord
[1:18:02] and make sure make sure make sure you've
[1:18:05] got the token in your hand because the
[1:18:07] bus is about to leave the Train's gonna
[1:18:09] go the boat's gonna sail and if you
[1:18:11] don't have the token you're not getting
[1:18:13] on
[1:18:14] if you don't have the token the book
[1:18:16] isn't open to you if you don't have the
[1:18:18] token it's only open to The Sixth Seal
[1:18:24] I know some people they believe that the
[1:18:27] Sixth Seal is all that's open
[1:18:29] you know it's interesting how we can
[1:18:30] take quotes and isolate them we can
[1:18:32] isolate quotes to say what we want them
[1:18:34] to say and we can say that brother
[1:18:36] Branham said that
[1:18:38] I heard him say it I read them I read it
[1:18:41] it's right there in black and white he
[1:18:42] said that
[1:18:44] and he said that about the seventh seal
[1:18:46] too
[1:18:47] so are we going to say that the seventh
[1:18:49] seal is closed
[1:18:52] if it's not an open book brothers and
[1:18:53] sisters then
[1:18:55] we've missed it
[1:18:56] we we haven't really achieved what what
[1:18:59] the desired effect was of the message of
[1:19:02] the hour that that Eternal inoculation
[1:19:04] if it's only the Sixth Seal that's open
[1:19:07] then we're not seeing the full measure
[1:19:09] of the word in our day it's not a
[1:19:10] perfect word it's an imperfect word
[1:19:12] and for years it was
[1:19:15] but why would there be a seventh angel
[1:19:17] messenger
[1:19:19] I don't know for me it can just be so
[1:19:22] clear so so so so so so obvious
[1:19:26] but it might not be for everyone and I
[1:19:29] just pray that it would be become that
[1:19:30] obvious that it would become so real to
[1:19:33] each and every one of us that all seven
[1:19:35] seals are open we have to take the
[1:19:37] entirety of the message for a thought we
[1:19:39] have to run a thought through the entire
[1:19:41] message we can't just say isolated one
[1:19:43] point he said this because if we do that
[1:19:45] we wind out on a limb and that's where
[1:19:47] Satan loves it Satan loves it that gives
[1:19:49] us if we've only got six seals open
[1:19:51] we've got the opportunity to have
[1:19:53] another
[1:19:54] messenger
[1:19:56] because we still need a seventh
[1:19:57] messenger if there's only six seals open
[1:20:00] we can have an eighth messenger then and
[1:20:02] then we wind up in trouble we can wind
[1:20:04] up with Jesus not being God we can wind
[1:20:06] up with all kinds of doctrinal
[1:20:07] differences things that are weird
[1:20:11] but there was many many years where
[1:20:14] where they knew in part and and they
[1:20:15] prophesied in part but they knew
[1:20:19] when that which is perfect is come
[1:20:22] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:20:24] with brothers and sisters I want to try
[1:20:27] and encourage us this morning if we have
[1:20:29] any old denominational baggage holding
[1:20:31] us back just put it away just just get
[1:20:34] rid of it just say everything that I
[1:20:36] think I know Lord I want to take it and
[1:20:38] put it on this sacrifice this morning
[1:20:39] when I come before you on my knees and I
[1:20:41] just want to burn it up before you I
[1:20:43] want to make it incinerate before you
[1:20:45] because I want to just clear out
[1:20:47] everything I want to purge I want to
[1:20:49] simplify my life and just allow only you
[1:20:52] as the present tense I am to just come
[1:20:54] into my heart and reveal yourself
[1:20:55] further to me according today today not
[1:20:59] yesterday and not tomorrow but right now
[1:21:01] today I need you to be God for me today
[1:21:06] and I believe it when when we get into
[1:21:08] verse 11 when that happens when we
[1:21:10] behave that way when we have that kind
[1:21:11] of attitude towards the Lord in our
[1:21:13] lives when we get into verse 11 when I
[1:21:15] was a child I speak as a child we'll
[1:21:17] begin to understand that when we were
[1:21:18] spiritually children when we didn't
[1:21:20] really understand throughout all the
[1:21:22] ages it wasn't very long ago I've heard
[1:21:24] ministers say this that they didn't
[1:21:26] really understand the message of the
[1:21:27] hour 10 years ago like they do today
[1:21:29] they didn't understand it 20 years ago
[1:21:31] like they do today think about 30 or 40
[1:21:34] years ago brother Branham asked people
[1:21:36] in his in his meetings do you understand
[1:21:37] what's being said to you and they would
[1:21:40] some would say yeah you know maybe kind
[1:21:43] of a little uneasy and he said no you
[1:21:44] don't because it's not for you it's for
[1:21:46] another day it's for another group of
[1:21:48] people and brothers and sisters here we
[1:21:50] are we have the opportunity to take that
[1:21:52] which is perfect
[1:21:54] so we can push away that which is in
[1:21:56] part we don't have to try and hold on to
[1:21:58] Old thoughts and old ideologies and old
[1:22:00] traditional teachings you know there are
[1:22:02] old traditional teachings things that
[1:22:04] come in to the message of the hour from
[1:22:07] people that were brought out of
[1:22:08] different denominational isms and if
[1:22:11] we're not careful those things spill
[1:22:13] over into our lives and they will
[1:22:15] corrupt us they will hold us back from
[1:22:17] allowing the word to manifest in our
[1:22:19] lives I heard brother Paul say it and
[1:22:21] I'm not picking off on you brother but
[1:22:24] to have the Liberty to go and run around
[1:22:25] just do it praise the Lord give them the
[1:22:29] glory that's in your heart try it and
[1:22:31] see what happens
[1:22:34] brother Paul do you remember that time
[1:22:35] that we were in Orlando
[1:22:37] we went down to Sarasota do you remember
[1:22:39] that service goodness sakes goodness
[1:22:42] sakes alive those people got right
[1:22:43] Pentecostal that was brother Danny
[1:22:45] Stephens church you know what they were
[1:22:47] living a Pentecostal experience man the
[1:22:49] the spirit of God was moving in their
[1:22:51] lives and they didn't care who was
[1:22:52] watching they didn't care what was going
[1:22:54] on around them they just wanted to to
[1:22:56] they had to move because that spirit of
[1:23:00] God was on them that was awesome I
[1:23:02] remember looking around thinking wow the
[1:23:05] spirit of God we need to be able to just
[1:23:08] be that way
[1:23:10] you know what as long as I'm here I'm
[1:23:11] not going to judge anyone
[1:23:13] if I ever saw someone rise up in in real
[1:23:16] excitement in the in the spirit of
[1:23:18] Christ and then have somebody come over
[1:23:20] to them and say Hey you know you're
[1:23:21] going to behave that way in a service I
[1:23:23] I'd have a bone to pick we're going to
[1:23:25] have a conversation about it because
[1:23:27] where the spirit is there's liberty
[1:23:28] brothers and sisters that's the word of
[1:23:30] God Satan wants to keep us cold and
[1:23:33] indifferent lukewarm formal and
[1:23:35] Powerless but you know what like we
[1:23:37] talked about on Wednesday well we can
[1:23:38] see those trespassing Devils we can say
[1:23:40] you're a trespassing devil we can
[1:23:42] identify him and rebuke him in the name
[1:23:44] of Jesus Christ and say hey you know
[1:23:46] what we need to be hot or cold and
[1:23:48] inside here I recommend we be hot
[1:23:52] we don't want to be cold we don't want
[1:23:54] to be lukewarm formal empowerless
[1:23:56] starchy and afraid because it's just the
[1:23:58] way I am and it's just the way people
[1:23:59] have always been it's the way we've
[1:24:01] always done it you know the children of
[1:24:02] Israel when they crossed over Jordan
[1:24:04] nobody had ever gone over there into the
[1:24:06] promised land the spies had gone over
[1:24:07] and ten of those Valiant men of their
[1:24:10] day said oh no we can't do it even
[1:24:13] though we got the word of the Lord but
[1:24:14] there was only two that were another
[1:24:15] spirit and they were the ones that said
[1:24:17] no by the spirit of God we can do it we
[1:24:20] are more than conquerors let's go across
[1:24:23] nobody knows what it's going to be like
[1:24:25] to go as far as we're going brothers and
[1:24:27] sisters we're so far down the road past
[1:24:29] brother Branham nobody has been here
[1:24:32] before but if we have the word as as our
[1:24:35] absolute and we have the idea that you
[1:24:38] know what when that which is perfect is
[1:24:39] come then we can do away with that which
[1:24:42] was in part I'm not saying there's any
[1:24:43] part of the message that was in part
[1:24:45] brothers and sisters I'm saying the
[1:24:46] message of the hour is in full that is
[1:24:49] perfect that has come
[1:24:52] so where are we at
[1:24:54] e wow
[1:24:58] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:25:03] that semicolon
[1:25:05] but then face to face
[1:25:08] brothers and sisters look at that
[1:25:09] picture again brother Phil you want to
[1:25:11] bring it up
[1:25:12] look at that picture
[1:25:15] but then we see face to face
[1:25:18] what happened in 1963 brothers and
[1:25:20] sisters
[1:25:22] brother Branham didn't come here to
[1:25:24] start a church he didn't come here to be
[1:25:26] the founder
[1:25:27] a voice of God Recordings
[1:25:29] he didn't come to start an organization
[1:25:32] he came here so that he could introduce
[1:25:34] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] to Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] so that he could introduce Jesus Christ
[1:25:41] to his bride
[1:25:43] his words I didn't come to start an
[1:25:46] organization I came to show people that
[1:25:49] they are the dwelling place the
[1:25:51] PowerHouse of the holy spirit of God
[1:25:57] you know in the Seven Seals
[1:25:59] not the six
[1:26:00] in the Seven Seals questions and answers
[1:26:03] in 1964.
[1:26:07] have the seven Thunders which equals the
[1:26:10] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[1:26:12] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:26:14] not the six
[1:26:17] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[1:26:20] as the Thunders yet
[1:26:23] brother Branham says no
[1:26:25] they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:26:27] not the six seals
[1:26:31] they were revealed in the Seven Seals he
[1:26:33] says
[1:26:35] that's what the Thunders was about
[1:26:39] they was about to reveal the seven
[1:26:41] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[1:26:42] and no one could make out what it was
[1:26:44] John knew what it was but he was
[1:26:46] forbidden to write it he said but the
[1:26:48] seventh angel
[1:26:49] and the days of his sounding
[1:26:52] the seven Mysteries of the seven
[1:26:54] Thunders would be revealed
[1:26:59] and the seventh angel is saying this
[1:27:02] here the seventh angel says and the
[1:27:04] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[1:27:07] seventh Church age
[1:27:13] I just say this like just I can't make
[1:27:15] it any clear the Seven Seals are open if
[1:27:18] the six if it's only six seals it's
[1:27:20] still a closed book brothers and sisters
[1:27:22] the the book of redemption isn't open
[1:27:23] then John would still be in heaven
[1:27:25] weeping
[1:27:26] remember he wept greatly when he was in
[1:27:29] heaven because there was no man worthy
[1:27:30] to open the book this book he descended
[1:27:33] Out of Heaven we've read it this is the
[1:27:35] Keystone scripture for the message of
[1:27:36] the hour he descends out of heaven with
[1:27:37] an open book
[1:27:39] puts one foot on the land and one foot
[1:27:41] on the sea if it was only six seals that
[1:27:44] book would be closed brothers and
[1:27:45] sisters it would not be open it couldn't
[1:27:47] be open
[1:27:50] but brothers and sisters we can say
[1:27:54] in the days of the seventh angel when he
[1:27:56] shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:27:58] Christ should be revealed we can say
[1:28:01] this day
[1:28:02] this scripture is fulfilled it's no
[1:28:06] longer hidden it's hidden in plain sight
[1:28:09] and if you want to look you'll actually
[1:28:12] see it but that's the problem when
[1:28:14] people have these weird little doctrinal
[1:28:16] things they become comfortable they
[1:28:19] become their resting place and usually
[1:28:21] what happens is they wind up having
[1:28:23] Pride which is the original sin we know
[1:28:25] that goes right back into heaven
[1:28:27] the original
[1:28:29] Pride
[1:28:31] too much of it to be able to say Lord be
[1:28:33] it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:28:37] we don't want that
[1:28:40] you know the seven Church ages the Seven
[1:28:42] Seals the seven Thunders
[1:28:45] we've gone through all seven ages we're
[1:28:48] at the seventh age now the ending of the
[1:28:50] seventh age and I would even go so far
[1:28:52] as to say this and maybe I'm wrong but
[1:28:54] let's have a discussion about it you
[1:28:56] know what we're past the seventh age
[1:28:59] or at least we're at the blending of the
[1:29:01] seventh age brother Branham said we're
[1:29:03] at the bride Age The Bride coming of
[1:29:05] Christ
[1:29:07] you know there's never a quick stop and
[1:29:10] start between ages there's always a
[1:29:12] blending
[1:29:13] I would say this for how far down the
[1:29:15] road we are I believe it with all my
[1:29:16] heart that we are into the bright age we
[1:29:19] are into the Eighth Day we're into the
[1:29:21] place where just like John was invited
[1:29:22] up into heaven he saw a door open in
[1:29:25] heaven and he was invited to come up
[1:29:26] hither to take a look and see the things
[1:29:28] that that should happen shortly
[1:29:30] Hereafter and immediately when he looked
[1:29:32] he was in the spirit and he saw on the
[1:29:35] Lord's day what was going on in heaven
[1:29:37] he was around the throne he got to see
[1:29:39] that image in heaven
[1:29:41] we know there's a special word for each
[1:29:43] age every single Church age has a
[1:29:45] special word word for it and each age
[1:29:49] is told that he that hath an ear
[1:29:52] laodicea is asked the same thing if
[1:29:54] you've got an ear
[1:29:55] listen to what the spirit saith
[1:29:58] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:30:00] the spirit saith to the church but you
[1:30:02] know he says it in uh I'm just going to
[1:30:05] turn back to it here
[1:30:06] in verse 20 of Revelations chapter 3
[1:30:10] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:30:13] he's standing at the door knocking
[1:30:15] now let's talk about this for a second
[1:30:18] what door is he standing at
[1:30:23] and is it actually a door
[1:30:26] we know that there's the picture
[1:30:28] of him standing outside of a door
[1:30:30] knocking and there's a lantern there and
[1:30:32] it shows him there and and brother
[1:30:34] Branham he said he had that question
[1:30:35] someone asked him he or he tells the
[1:30:37] story The Artist did everything just
[1:30:39] right except for he didn't put a handle
[1:30:41] set on the outside of that door and and
[1:30:44] and and the artist said no the handle
[1:30:47] set isn't on the outside of the door
[1:30:48] it's on the inside of the door and he
[1:30:50] Likens it to a person's heart Christ on
[1:30:53] the outside of the church knocking on
[1:30:55] the door to come in and the only way
[1:30:57] he's going to come in is if we let him
[1:30:59] in but how is that going to happen if we
[1:31:01] don't have a revelation
[1:31:03] we've got to have a spiritual revelation
[1:31:06] so you know John was given that
[1:31:08] invitation to come up a little higher
[1:31:11] he was given that invitation he was
[1:31:13] shown a door in heaven
[1:31:15] brothers and sisters I want to ask the
[1:31:17] question this morning what did that door
[1:31:19] look like
[1:31:22] did it have hinges
[1:31:24] and a handle set
[1:31:26] was it nicely stained wood
[1:31:28] or was it glass
[1:31:31] did it have nice silver polished hinges
[1:31:34] and and handles on it
[1:31:36] what was that door in heaven
[1:31:40] personally maybe I'm quacked but I
[1:31:43] believe it that it wasn't the door it's
[1:31:46] just his descriptive word
[1:31:48] I believe it was a cloud
[1:31:51] there was 26 miles high and 30 miles
[1:31:54] across
[1:31:55] because he is Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:58] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[1:31:59] change his ways he operates the same way
[1:32:02] so that he doesn't confuse the people
[1:32:04] but what he does do is confound the wise
[1:32:07] by acting the same and he'll reveal
[1:32:10] himself throughout all the scriptures
[1:32:12] exactly the same way
[1:32:14] you know remember in Acts chapter 1
[1:32:17] let's turn there for a second Acts
[1:32:19] chapter 1 verses 9 to 11.
[1:32:26] Acts chapter 1.
[1:32:30] talking about the cloud
[1:32:33] Resurrection by the cloud
[1:32:35] because it needs to be a present tense
[1:32:37] Resurrection
[1:32:41] Acts
[1:32:44] chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:32:48] Jesus Christ had just spoken to them the
[1:32:51] last words that he spoke
[1:32:53] in verse 9 chapter 1
[1:32:55] and when he had spoken these things
[1:32:57] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[1:33:00] cloud received him out of their sight
[1:33:03] and while they looked steadfastly
[1:33:05] towards heaven as he went up behold two
[1:33:07] men stood by them in white apparel which
[1:33:10] also said ye men of Galilee
[1:33:13] why stanji gazing up into heaven
[1:33:16] the same Jesus which is taken up from
[1:33:19] you into heaven remember it was a cloud
[1:33:21] that received him up but now they're
[1:33:23] saying that he was received up into
[1:33:24] heaven
[1:33:26] shall so come in like manner as ye have
[1:33:30] seen him go into heaven
[1:33:34] the whole world is looking for the
[1:33:36] 60-foot Jesus
[1:33:38] the trains planes and Automobiles
[1:33:40] crashing and smashing
[1:33:42] the great disappearance of people
[1:33:45] brother Branham told us that it's going
[1:33:46] to be the secret sudden
[1:33:48] going of the Bride
[1:33:51] two will be in the field and one will be
[1:33:53] taken two will be in the bed and one
[1:33:54] will be taken two will be maybe in
[1:33:56] service and one will be taken
[1:33:59] it's going to just be a simple little
[1:34:02] thing and brother Branham says it that
[1:34:04] nobody will even know it
[1:34:06] nobody will even know it Lord help us
[1:34:10] brothers and sisters we've been shown a
[1:34:11] cloud in our day so what does this Cloud
[1:34:14] mean
[1:34:15] as I said before some some believe that
[1:34:18] it's just a vindication
[1:34:20] of God with his man other people look at
[1:34:22] the cloud and they'll say oh it was a
[1:34:24] rocket it was it was a rocket that was
[1:34:26] from from the Air Force Base that just
[1:34:28] went went wild
[1:34:30] other people will look at the cloud and
[1:34:32] they'll say that was a sign that brother
[1:34:33] Branham was hunting out a season
[1:34:36] remember what brother Bradham says I I
[1:34:39] should have that quote forgive me but he
[1:34:41] says that he'll make it happen first
[1:34:43] he'll bring it to pass and then he'll
[1:34:46] reveal it
[1:34:49] just because brother Branham didn't come
[1:34:50] right out and say start talking about
[1:34:52] all this that happened it doesn't mean
[1:34:54] that it didn't happen
[1:34:55] we're talking about a supernatural event
[1:34:57] for people to try and click a timeline
[1:34:59] and do a time stamp for every single
[1:35:01] thing that happened with it that's
[1:35:03] impossible that's like trying to put God
[1:35:05] inside a box but we know that That's
[1:35:06] what Satan does Satan wants to get us
[1:35:09] balled up and thinking that you know
[1:35:10] there's a Shadow of Doubt About This
[1:35:12] Cloud very specifically about this Cloud
[1:35:13] because if he can keep us from actually
[1:35:16] recognizing what happened when this
[1:35:18] Cloud came then he has time on this
[1:35:20] Earth but brothers and sisters remember
[1:35:22] when the church gets the true revelation
[1:35:25] of what it is then the Rapture will go
[1:35:30] I'm just going to keep harping about the
[1:35:31] cloud and the and the Rapture and the
[1:35:33] cloud and the Rapture and the Holy Ghost
[1:35:34] In Our Lives get in that token get in
[1:35:36] the Rapture get in get in get in the
[1:35:39] Holy Ghost making sure we have the token
[1:35:40] making sure that we've got that blood
[1:35:42] applied to the lentils and the door
[1:35:43] posts
[1:35:46] of Our Lives
[1:35:47] even back in Exodus they were talking
[1:35:49] about the door
[1:35:51] how important it was to make sure that
[1:35:52] blood was applied to the door
[1:35:54] it's amazing to see he is exactly the
[1:35:57] same throughout the scripture he just
[1:35:58] keeps it going the same way and it
[1:36:00] confounds the wise but it's revealed
[1:36:02] unto babes such as would learn
[1:36:07] you know to others that picture it's
[1:36:09] Christ
[1:36:11] I believe that's who we're talking to
[1:36:13] today
[1:36:14] those people that look at that picture
[1:36:15] and they see Christ they don't look at
[1:36:17] that picture and think William Branham
[1:36:18] they don't look at that picture and
[1:36:19] think voice of God Recordings there's no
[1:36:21] trademarking of that picture
[1:36:24] but they look at that picture and they
[1:36:25] think Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:36:27] today and forever the coming of the Lord
[1:36:29] that's what that picture is
[1:36:32] might sound crazy
[1:36:35] but it can't be man's thinking brothers
[1:36:37] and sisters it has to be according to
[1:36:39] the word
[1:36:40] you know the word says in Revelations 3
[1:36:45] verse 7 and to the angel of the church
[1:36:47] in Philadelphia write these things saith
[1:36:49] he that is Holy he that is true he that
[1:36:52] hath the Key of David
[1:36:55] who would have the Key of David
[1:36:58] he that openeth
[1:36:59] and no man shuttif
[1:37:01] and shutteth
[1:37:03] and no man openeth
[1:37:06] he that hath the key
[1:37:09] verse 8 I Know Thy Works behold I have
[1:37:12] set before thee an Open Door
[1:37:17] and no man can shut it
[1:37:19] I just love how he says this because I
[1:37:21] believe that this there are people in
[1:37:23] our day that fit this description even
[1:37:26] though this was the anointing for this
[1:37:27] age
[1:37:30] I know that works behold I have set
[1:37:32] before thee an Open Door no man can shut
[1:37:34] it for thou Hast a little strength and
[1:37:36] has kept my word
[1:37:38] and has not denied my name
[1:37:40] I believe that just fits the perfect
[1:37:42] description of a Believer for today
[1:37:45] how many people have such great strength
[1:37:47] they can just withstand on their own
[1:37:49] he know we know he says it
[1:37:52] in perfect strength
[1:37:54] I'm I'm made strong through weakness
[1:37:59] I worded that wrong forgive me
[1:38:02] but to think about it
[1:38:04] an open door was this a literal Open
[1:38:06] Door
[1:38:08] or was this a door by revelation
[1:38:11] and that's really what we're talking
[1:38:12] about today brothers and sisters even
[1:38:13] though we see the cloud and and John
[1:38:16] maybe he saw a cloud in the sky he saw a
[1:38:18] door open in heaven you know what he was
[1:38:20] given he was given a doorway call it a
[1:38:22] doorway he was given an opportunity for
[1:38:24] a further Revelation for a higher
[1:38:26] Revelation an opportunity to see the
[1:38:28] throne room of heaven and each and every
[1:38:30] one of us that received the message of
[1:38:32] the hour we received the reward of a
[1:38:34] prophet we get to see the throne room of
[1:38:36] Heaven as well according to the
[1:38:38] description of the Prophet that door in
[1:38:40] heaven
[1:38:41] in in Colossians chapter 4 verse 3 with
[1:38:45] all praying also for us that God would
[1:38:47] open unto us a door of utterance
[1:38:51] a door of utterance
[1:38:53] to speak the mystery of Christ
[1:38:57] for which I am also in bonds
[1:38:59] Revelations 4 verse 1. after this I
[1:39:01] looked and behold a door was opened in
[1:39:03] heaven
[1:39:05] the first voice which I heard was as it
[1:39:08] were of a trumpet talking with me saying
[1:39:10] come up hither and I will show Thee the
[1:39:12] things which must be Hereafter and
[1:39:14] immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:39:16] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:39:18] one sat on the throne
[1:39:21] John given the ability to go and see
[1:39:24] inside heaven through the door
[1:39:28] brothers and sisters I believe it with
[1:39:29] all my heart we've been given a doorway
[1:39:31] today as well
[1:39:32] and it's not through William Branham the
[1:39:35] door is Jesus Christ and that cloud is
[1:39:38] Jesus Christ and that Revelation is
[1:39:41] Jesus Christ it all points to Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ and all of that points to the
[1:39:46] throne and if we can go through that
[1:39:47] doorway if we can look at that cloud and
[1:39:49] begin to see Jesus Christ in that cloud
[1:39:52] don't see brother Bradham
[1:39:54] don't see brother Branham some people
[1:39:55] have done that those are doctrines of
[1:39:57] devils those are the ones who actually
[1:39:59] go on and make another messenger and do
[1:40:01] all that stuff don't do that
[1:40:03] that's not right
[1:40:05] see Jesus
[1:40:08] remember when Jesus took the boys up on
[1:40:11] the mountain and he showed them
[1:40:13] Moses and Elijah and Peter got so
[1:40:17] excited so inspired he said oh Lord let
[1:40:19] us make three Tabernacles one for each
[1:40:21] of the then a cloud is what covered them
[1:40:24] remember it was a cloud that covered
[1:40:25] them and they heard one voice saying
[1:40:28] this is my beloved Son hearing ye him
[1:40:30] and when that voice was gone and the
[1:40:32] cloud was gone there was only one
[1:40:35] there was only Jesus there
[1:40:40] but immediately John was in the spirit
[1:40:43] brother Branham talks about this I could
[1:40:45] go into this but I'm not going to this
[1:40:47] morning about the importance of getting
[1:40:48] in the spirit
[1:40:50] so that's why brothers and sisters if
[1:40:51] you feel inspired
[1:40:53] Just go with it I'm not going to say
[1:40:54] anything about it I'm going to encourage
[1:40:55] it I'm not saying we're looking for a a
[1:40:57] Pentecostal Revival in our our building
[1:41:00] but I do believe that when the
[1:41:01] inspiration of of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:03] strikes something happens to the person
[1:41:05] David when he was excited to see the ark
[1:41:08] come remember he got so inspired he
[1:41:11] danced before the Lord and and so much
[1:41:14] so that his wife got offended at him
[1:41:16] brothers and sisters we don't want to
[1:41:18] judge anyone we don't want to look at
[1:41:19] anybody we want to say if someone is
[1:41:21] having a time with the Lord Lord give me
[1:41:23] an experience like that I want to have a
[1:41:25] revelation like that I want to get
[1:41:27] inspired to that extent
[1:41:30] behold I stand at the door and knock in
[1:41:32] Revelations chapter 3 stand at the door
[1:41:35] and you know what I would say this he
[1:41:37] stands at your Revelation he stands at
[1:41:40] your Revelation are you willing to allow
[1:41:43] yourself to actually open that door of
[1:41:45] Revelation into your heart or are you
[1:41:48] willingly interested only interested in
[1:41:50] saying no I I I understand the message
[1:41:52] of the hour and and I've been taught all
[1:41:54] I can been taught and and there's
[1:41:55] nothing you can teach me I've been in it
[1:41:58] for years and years and and it's all
[1:41:59] good I'm saved by God's grace if that's
[1:42:02] the case then you know what it's not
[1:42:04] going to happen
[1:42:05] are we getting fresh revelation we have
[1:42:08] to be willing to get fresh revelation
[1:42:10] it doesn't come by me I'm not saying by
[1:42:12] me I'm saying by the Holy Ghost it has
[1:42:14] to be by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:42:16] Revelation on true Revelation only comes
[1:42:19] by the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters
[1:42:20] but why do we get together why do we go
[1:42:22] to church so that we can hear preaching
[1:42:24] and preaching of the word and and if
[1:42:27] it's in season then it's going to help
[1:42:28] perfect us that's the way it works
[1:42:31] that's why we need to be on our face
[1:42:32] before the Lord laboring to hear fresh
[1:42:35] Revelation from him but that fresh
[1:42:37] Revelation is never going to be
[1:42:39] different than the word it's always
[1:42:40] going to be leftovers we heard brother
[1:42:41] Ken say that over and over again you're
[1:42:43] just getting leftovers you're just
[1:42:44] getting something that we've talked
[1:42:45] about we've preached about but you know
[1:42:47] there is a portion of it that is a fresh
[1:42:49] Revelation I would say it there is a
[1:42:51] fresh Revelation that comes for every
[1:42:53] single age because when that which is in
[1:42:55] part is done away with that which is
[1:42:58] perfect is come
[1:42:59] brothers and sisters we see in part in
[1:43:02] Exodus 33 and he said thou can't see my
[1:43:04] face God revealing himself to Moses
[1:43:07] remember Moses he wanted to see God he
[1:43:08] asked him can I see you
[1:43:10] and he said okay here this is what I'll
[1:43:13] do and in verse 20 Exodus 33 and he said
[1:43:16] thou canst not see my face for their
[1:43:18] shall no man see me and live and the
[1:43:20] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[1:43:22] Thou shalt stand upon a rock Revelation
[1:43:26] Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[1:43:28] shall come to pass while my Glory
[1:43:30] passeth by that I will put thee in a
[1:43:32] cleft of the rock I'll put you in a
[1:43:34] special place of Revelation Moses I'll
[1:43:37] put you in a cleft of The Rock and cover
[1:43:39] thee with my hand while I pass by I say
[1:43:42] Lord cover me with thy hand while you
[1:43:44] pass by just give me a greater
[1:43:46] Revelation put me in that cleft of the
[1:43:48] rock oh my where your glory can pass by
[1:43:51] me and he says I will take away mine
[1:43:53] hand and thou shalt see my back Parts
[1:43:55] but my face shall not be seen brothers
[1:43:57] and sisters what do we see in the cloud
[1:43:59] today when that which is perfect is come
[1:44:02] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:44:04] away with there was a time where you
[1:44:06] couldn't see God's face where you
[1:44:07] couldn't see his face but today what do
[1:44:10] we have the opportunity Unity to see and
[1:44:12] fall my goodness we know in part for we
[1:44:16] know in part and we prophesy in part but
[1:44:17] when that which is perfect is come my
[1:44:22] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:44:23] away with
[1:44:25] you so think about it brothers and
[1:44:26] sisters
[1:44:27] when I was a child I spake as a child
[1:44:31] think about the Believers speaking this
[1:44:33] when I was a child I spake as a child as
[1:44:36] a Believer when when we were children
[1:44:38] when we were babes being fed milk
[1:44:41] we spake as babes being fed milk
[1:44:47] I thought as a child I understood as a
[1:44:50] child but when I became a man I was able
[1:44:53] to eat strong meat
[1:44:54] the revelation of the word started to
[1:44:57] break for me and I was able to receive
[1:44:59] it as a greater Revelation as a stronger
[1:45:02] food that that was in due season for me
[1:45:05] because when I became a man I put away
[1:45:07] childish things it's not saying that I
[1:45:09] stopped doing all childish things that I
[1:45:11] used to play games when I was a kid and
[1:45:12] I used to dance around when I was a kid
[1:45:14] and I used to do all of that no I
[1:45:16] believe there's a greater Revelation to
[1:45:17] this scripture it's about spiritual
[1:45:19] Revelation brothers and sisters Paul is
[1:45:21] telling the church in Corinthians no
[1:45:23] when you're a child you behave as a
[1:45:25] child but when you become a full adult
[1:45:26] of full age in the word something
[1:45:29] different takes place in your life you
[1:45:31] no longer speak as a child you're not
[1:45:32] talking about skim milk things and
[1:45:34] brothers and sisters we're not talking
[1:45:36] about skim milk here we're talking about
[1:45:37] the coming of the Lord No in fact we're
[1:45:40] talking about the going of the Lord do
[1:45:42] you have the token in your hand is what
[1:45:44] I want to say to the church is he a
[1:45:46] resurrected Christ Jesus in your heart
[1:45:49] today or is it just something out of the
[1:45:51] past or is it something for the future
[1:45:52] it's got to be the present tense I am
[1:45:55] right now the living Jesus Christ in our
[1:45:59] lives
[1:46:01] we're talking about spiritual maturity
[1:46:02] understanding the fullness of the word
[1:46:04] it was broken for us in our day
[1:46:07] but we have to have years to hear it and
[1:46:10] eyes to see it and most of all a heart
[1:46:12] to receive it but brothers and sisters
[1:46:15] if we have been given those things my
[1:46:17] goodness we should be able to do
[1:46:18] cartwheels up and down all over the
[1:46:21] place to know that the billions and
[1:46:22] millions of people in this world that
[1:46:24] would love to be able to have a an
[1:46:27] ability to hear what the spirit saith
[1:46:29] unto the church we're just going to go
[1:46:31] and sit in his throne
[1:46:33] and judge those people
[1:46:34] those people are going to come before
[1:46:36] the throne trembling with their knees
[1:46:38] knocking because they know that unless
[1:46:40] someone's sitting in that Throne has a
[1:46:43] voice of good for them they're doomed to
[1:46:46] Eternal separation
[1:46:48] I heard a quote and and it's really
[1:46:50] stuck with me brother Branham says it
[1:46:52] that uh it's going to be our
[1:46:53] responsibility we're going to be
[1:46:54] responsible for all the people Before
[1:46:56] the Throne every single person in every
[1:46:58] single age that has the ability to hear
[1:47:00] the word we're going to be responsible
[1:47:02] for all those people that come before
[1:47:03] the weight Throne judgment because we
[1:47:05] didn't actually tell them about what we
[1:47:07] know about this great life that we have
[1:47:10] within us this great secret this great
[1:47:12] mystery it makes me want to get out of
[1:47:14] soapbox and just go and stand on every
[1:47:16] single Street Corner put on a sandwich
[1:47:18] board and say I'm a fool for Christ
[1:47:20] whose fool are you go on hand out tracks
[1:47:23] go on knock on doors think about the
[1:47:24] Jehovah's Witnesses knocking on doors
[1:47:26] and and saying have you heard about this
[1:47:28] great message are we doing that
[1:47:31] my are we going to the mission fields
[1:47:34] and trying to take it overseas and go
[1:47:36] over there but what does the mailman
[1:47:37] know do they know
[1:47:38] do our neighbors know
[1:47:40] preaching to me now
[1:47:42] I'm not talking about anybody else but
[1:47:43] myself
[1:47:45] are we ministering to the people in our
[1:47:47] own world
[1:47:51] we have the ability to speak about an
[1:47:53] open book brothers and sisters
[1:47:55] to the entire world it's a closed book
[1:47:58] in the denominational worlds they're
[1:48:00] waiting for Revelations 19 to come and
[1:48:03] open the book
[1:48:05] and and and it's too late they will have
[1:48:08] missed the second crucifixion of the
[1:48:10] Lord Jesus Christ and to think that
[1:48:11] we've been given the ability the
[1:48:13] opportunity to actually come up hither
[1:48:15] just like John John is a type of the
[1:48:16] Bride in Revelations is what the prophet
[1:48:18] said he was given the opportunity to
[1:48:20] come up hither he had a door open in
[1:48:22] heaven brothers and sisters we've been
[1:48:24] given that cloud we've been given a door
[1:48:27] open in heaven an opportunity to come up
[1:48:29] hither just like John did he's the same
[1:48:32] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[1:48:34] do things differently he doesn't operate
[1:48:35] outside of his word he always operates
[1:48:37] inside of his word
[1:48:39] so we want to be careful we're not
[1:48:41] looking for something that's not going
[1:48:42] to happen
[1:48:43] or something that is going to happen
[1:48:46] but we have it out of time
[1:48:48] we have to make sure that we know
[1:48:50] exactly where we are
[1:48:52] some people just look at it
[1:48:54] from a six seal perspective
[1:48:56] this just hit me this morning a Sixth
[1:48:58] Seal perspective
[1:49:00] and and there's nothing that we can do
[1:49:01] about that except for try and encourage
[1:49:03] them and pray for them
[1:49:04] I don't throw off on anybody
[1:49:06] but there's people that genuinely
[1:49:08] believe
[1:49:09] that there's only six seals open but if
[1:49:11] that's the case then the word isn't open
[1:49:13] to them it's not a perfect word it's an
[1:49:15] imperfect word it creates the ability
[1:49:17] for there to be little little glitches
[1:49:19] in the word and then we can start to
[1:49:20] actually bring in another Doctrine but
[1:49:23] then there's other people that see it as
[1:49:25] a seventh seal they see the full word
[1:49:27] open to them they're believing from a
[1:49:30] seventh seal perspective you know what
[1:49:32] it's either it's one way or the other
[1:49:34] and and I just can't really say it any
[1:49:36] other way it's either a doctrine of a
[1:49:38] devil or it's a doctrine of God it's the
[1:49:40] Lord Jesus Christ it's either the open
[1:49:42] word or the closed word it's either
[1:49:45] black or it's white There's No Gray
[1:49:46] there's no mixing in a little bit of
[1:49:49] false Doctrine with the word you've
[1:49:51] tried that and look at us now
[1:49:54] how many years down the road there's no
[1:49:57] mixing in there's no hybridizing of this
[1:50:00] word
[1:50:02] seeing through a glass Darkly in in
[1:50:04] verse 12 now we see through a glass
[1:50:06] Darkly back in that day they just
[1:50:09] couldn't see the full truth it wasn't
[1:50:11] for them it wasn't to be revealed to
[1:50:12] them
[1:50:13] I should probably quit now it's 12.
[1:50:16] I'm just about done bear with me for a
[1:50:18] few minutes
[1:50:20] see through a glass Darkly
[1:50:23] then face to face
[1:50:26] I just can't get past this scripture
[1:50:28] when I I look about that that cloud when
[1:50:31] you think about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:33] the white wigged one brother Branham
[1:50:36] brings that in the message I think it's
[1:50:39] trying to do God a service
[1:50:41] I I can't remember specifically which
[1:50:43] one it is it's in 1965 but he gives so
[1:50:46] many graphic descriptions about this
[1:50:48] fairy picture but when we see him face
[1:50:51] to face someone has to see him face to
[1:50:54] face is what Paul is saying for now in
[1:50:56] in the Corinthian Church back then 2000
[1:50:58] years ago we see through a glass Darkly
[1:51:00] we're looking through a glass but we
[1:51:02] just can't totally see through it but
[1:51:04] then once that glass gets cleaned we're
[1:51:07] going to see face to face because right
[1:51:10] now I know in part
[1:51:11] but then
[1:51:13] shall I know even
[1:51:15] as also I am known
[1:51:18] as even also
[1:51:20] I am
[1:51:22] known
[1:51:24] think about that
[1:51:26] when we look in the mirror what do we
[1:51:27] see when we look in the cloud what do we
[1:51:30] see we've got to come to the place when
[1:51:32] we look at our brother and our sister
[1:51:33] what do we see
[1:51:35] I don't look and see my brother and
[1:51:36] sister and see the badger skin if I do
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:41] if I could have a hard time and I trust
[1:51:44] that when you look at me brothers and
[1:51:46] sisters you don't look at me don't look
[1:51:48] at me don't look at the badger skin just
[1:51:50] look at Christ just follow Christ
[1:51:52] if we can do that brothers and sisters
[1:51:54] if we can look at the cloud and see
[1:51:56] Jesus face and see that millions and
[1:51:59] billions of people are Desiring to see
[1:52:01] what we just have the ability we just
[1:52:03] we've just been given it freely the
[1:52:05] ability to understand who we are in our
[1:52:07] day
[1:52:09] so brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:52:11] ask it what does the resurrection
[1:52:12] morning mean to you it's such a
[1:52:15] different angle to go down this road but
[1:52:18] I really think it's so important not to
[1:52:21] talk about it being just a a beautiful
[1:52:23] historical event and we could have gone
[1:52:25] down that road and I have in the past it
[1:52:27] is the rising of the sun it is the
[1:52:29] rising of the sun brothers and sisters
[1:52:30] but where
[1:52:32] what good is it if even if it was just
[1:52:34] in 1965 it's got to be in 2021.
[1:52:39] it's got to be in the midst of covet the
[1:52:41] rising of the Sun in our lives today we
[1:52:45] need to see God in flesh today
[1:52:50] it can't just be once a year
[1:52:53] many people will just go to church once
[1:52:55] a year and say wow we went to church on
[1:52:57] Christmas Eve and we went to church on
[1:52:58] Easter and we've heard it said they're
[1:53:00] called creasters and there's people that
[1:53:02] will do that and maybe it works for them
[1:53:04] but that's not really what it's all
[1:53:06] about brothers and sisters that's
[1:53:08] missing it that's a that's a lukewarm
[1:53:10] formal and Powerless traditional
[1:53:12] position in Christ
[1:53:14] maybe that's an oxymoron I take that
[1:53:17] back because that's not a position in
[1:53:18] Christ
[1:53:20] that's someone that hasn't had the book
[1:53:21] open to them
[1:53:23] but whose responsibility is it to open
[1:53:25] that book to them
[1:53:27] we know the prophet has brought it he's
[1:53:28] done his part Jesus has done it he did
[1:53:31] his part What About Us Where Do We Stand
[1:53:34] are we doing our part
[1:53:35] because it's not just a pastor we heard
[1:53:37] our brother pray today it's not the
[1:53:39] deacons it's not the song leader it's
[1:53:42] not the sound technicians it's not the
[1:53:44] trustees or the treasurer
[1:53:46] it's every single one of us we all have
[1:53:49] a part to play
[1:53:51] it's the many membered body I love it
[1:53:53] because it's not many membered bodies
[1:53:55] I'll call them musicians I'll quit now
[1:53:57] brothers and sisters what do we see when
[1:54:00] we look at the at the cloud well I I
[1:54:02] just hope that with all my heart we can
[1:54:04] look at that cloud and say wow maybe
[1:54:06] there is something more to that cloud
[1:54:08] it's a door open in heaven for us
[1:54:10] brothers and sisters just like John was
[1:54:12] given a door open to heaven to a higher
[1:54:15] calling an opportunity to have that
[1:54:17] greater revelation we have been given
[1:54:19] that as well
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:22] out of the rising of the sun stand with
[1:54:24] me this morning as we wrap this up here
[1:54:27] out of the rising of the sun I read it
[1:54:29] earlier because I live ye live also
[1:54:35] speaking to his wife
[1:54:37] because I live ye live also
[1:54:41] what a resurrection that that was
[1:54:44] and what a resurrection this is
[1:54:48] as much as we talk about the prophet we
[1:54:50] talk about William Branham we talk about
[1:54:52] the message of the hour
[1:54:54] he would not want us to be stuck in 1965
[1:54:58] 1964 1963
[1:55:01] all the way back to the beginning of his
[1:55:03] ministry 1947 he wouldn't want us to be
[1:55:05] stuck in in that if we were doing that
[1:55:08] we would be doing him a disservice we
[1:55:10] would be missing the mark we'd be
[1:55:12] missing the entire point of the message
[1:55:14] of the hour he was Eliezer
[1:55:18] gone to get Rebecca to bring her to
[1:55:20] Isaac there's so many types in the Bible
[1:55:22] but he came so that we could be
[1:55:25] introduced to the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:55:27] present tense I am that we could look at
[1:55:29] that cloud and see Jesus that we could
[1:55:32] look at that cloud and begin to see
[1:55:34] ourselves not because we're going to try
[1:55:36] and promote ourselves just because we
[1:55:38] are in Christ and when we look at our
[1:55:40] brothers and when we look at our sisters
[1:55:42] we see Christ we see the longing in
[1:55:45] their hearts to get together and
[1:55:46] fellowship to come to service to be in
[1:55:49] Fellowship continually feeding upon the
[1:55:51] word calling and encouraging to be
[1:55:54] sending out gift cards and Christian
[1:55:56] love to brothers and sisters that's the
[1:55:58] spirit of Christ
[1:56:03] I have just a testimony that I forgot to
[1:56:05] mention
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:07] sister Stella she asked me if I would
[1:56:10] just mention it
[1:56:11] someone sent her a gift card in
[1:56:13] Christian love
[1:56:15] and she said to say thank you in Jesus
[1:56:18] name
[1:56:19] brothers and sisters sometimes the
[1:56:22] things that we feel inspired to do can
[1:56:24] go a long ways
[1:56:27] for our brother and our sister
[1:56:29] don't underestimate what the Lord gives
[1:56:31] to you as a spiritual Revelation about
[1:56:34] doing if he inspires us to do something
[1:56:36] go with it try it out see what the Lord
[1:56:39] will do see if he won't bless it
[1:56:41] remember that he's just waiting for us
[1:56:43] to move
[1:56:44] he'll guide our footsteps
[1:56:46] but he's waiting for us to move he can't
[1:56:48] use us if we just sit still we need to
[1:56:50] March forward
[1:56:51] and see what he'll do
[1:56:53] because I live
[1:56:55] ye live also because he resurrected two
[1:56:58] thousand years ago he can resurrect in
[1:57:00] our hearts every single time we come to
[1:57:03] him on our knees because I live ye live
[1:57:05] also speaking to his wife because I live
[1:57:08] ye live also what a resurrection that
[1:57:11] that was and what a resurrection this is
[1:57:15] what a resurrection this is brothers and
[1:57:16] sisters to be quickened from the dead to
[1:57:19] be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:57:22] quickening power by his Holy Spirit by
[1:57:25] his charity by having his love his life
[1:57:27] his very own life living out through us
[1:57:33] let's just go to him in prayer
[1:57:36] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:57:38] Lord we just thank you for your word we
[1:57:40] thank you
[1:57:41] for your quickening power
[1:57:43] Lord we pray that if something was said
[1:57:46] this morning that would be confusing or
[1:57:48] or upsetting to anyone Lord I pray that
[1:57:50] you would just strike it from the record
[1:57:51] Lord I pray that you would forgive me

[1:58:05] come a little closer to your very image
[1:58:08] Lord Jesus that we wouldn't look at one
[1:58:10] another and see our brother or our
[1:58:12] sister in the carnal flesh but Lord that
[1:58:14] we would look at each other and we would
[1:58:16] see you

[1:58:36] the body where there's no mortar even
[1:58:39] between where when when the wife speaks
[1:58:42] it's the husband's words
[1:58:44] father we just want to be in tune with
[1:58:46] your spirit we want to be quickened by
[1:58:49] your word we don't want to be doing our
[1:58:51] own thing we don't want to we don't want

[1:58:54] want to follow your word very closely

[1:58:58] spirit leading so father we pray that
[1:59:01] you would just Quicken this word that
[1:59:02] was spoken today that you would just
[1:59:04] take us all up just a little bit higher
[1:59:06] father not in in Barry's Revelation but
[1:59:09] in John's Revelation in brother
[1:59:10] branham's Revelation in the revelation
[1:59:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ that we could
[1:59:15] come up into the heavenlies just like
[1:59:16] John and and be in the throne room of
[1:59:19] heaven and see one sitting on the throne
[1:59:21] Lord Jesus I pray that you would just
