[51:46] we pray amen God bless you tonight you
[51:50] may be
[51:52] seated certainly have been enjoying this
[51:55] study the exposition of the seven Church
[51:58] ages saman Church age has been a good
[52:03] study a real good study I don't want to
[52:06] go too far backwards tonight because I
[52:08] really want to press forward and uh Lord
[52:13] willing we will where we left off last
[52:16] week was sort of what brother Bram talks
[52:19] about quite extensively in the message
[52:21] the token about how there was a blood
[52:25] that was shed at Calvary
[52:27] the blood test shows whether you belong
[52:31] to God or not and he Likens it to
[52:35] running cattle out on a range where they
[52:38] had to actually check the cattle before
[52:40] they could turn them loose to make sure
[52:42] that they were purebred cattle and the
[52:46] inspector letting the cattle through
[52:48] wasn't interested in the type of cattle
[52:51] he wasn't interested in the type of
[52:52] Brands he wasn't interested in how big
[52:55] they were how small they were only thing
[52:57] he was interested in is that they had
[52:59] that blood tag that they showed they
[53:02] were the pure blood and it's not the
[53:04] chemical of the blood in terms of Jesus
[53:08] Christ it's actually the life of the
[53:10] blood many people claim the chemical
[53:14] part of the blood but not many people
[53:17] can actually say be thou Lord over my
[53:21] life and let the life of that blood
[53:24] reign supreme in my life life and that
[53:27] is the critical factor it's not the
[53:29] chemical
[53:30] portion we'll just pick up from
[53:32] paragraph 111 where we left off last
[53:34] week brother bradam says you know God
[53:37] looked down and declared the soul that
[53:39] sinth it shall die it is separated from
[53:43] me it can't approach unto me we know
[53:47] that all have sinned and fallen short of
[53:49] the glory of God
[53:51] Amen that meant that all died and were
[53:55] separated and one day a time would come
[53:59] when even that bit of life would be
[54:02] snuffed out and it would all be all over
[54:06] but God In Love took an animal and took
[54:10] its life in place of the sinner's
[54:13] life and I think we talked about how
[54:16] Adam and Eve after they sinned they got
[54:19] to walk out of the Garden of Eden they
[54:21] were escorted out they were no longer
[54:24] allowed access to the Tree of Life we
[54:26] know there was two trees in the garden
[54:28] one was the Tree of Life Jesus Christ
[54:31] God himself the other one was Satan and
[54:35] they were told not to pick of the fruit
[54:38] not to eat of the fruit of the tree of
[54:40] knowledge of Good and Evil Satan but Eve
[54:44] was deceived she decided to listen to
[54:46] the word of Satan instead of taking the
[54:48] word of God and that is where Adam said
[54:51] I can't lose that part of me she was a
[54:54] part of him God took her from his side
[54:57] the very first operation that ever
[54:59] happened and he willingly stepped out
[55:01] from eternity to save that part of him
[55:05] Amen in the Old Testament brother bradam
[55:08] says The Sinner brought a
[55:10] lamb he placed his hand on the lamb
[55:12] while the priest cut the Lamb's throat
[55:16] he felt the bleeding and heard the
[55:20] bleeting he felt the body stiffen in
[55:23] death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled
[55:26] blood Ascend to God he knew that the
[55:30] lamb had taken his
[55:32] place he knew the Lamb's life had been
[55:36] forfeited for his but the life of that
[55:40] lamb was animal life and it could not
[55:43] come back upon the sinner making him
[55:48] clean so he left with the same desire to
[55:51] sin he would go out with sin in his mind
[55:55] and come back and offer a sacrifice for
[55:58] the same thing a year
[56:00] later but in the New Testament it is not
[56:02] so our dying lamb is the Son of God who
[56:06] gave his blood a ransom for many amen I
[56:11] love how brother brandham talks about
[56:12] this as we go further he does it he
[56:15] weaves it in and out through the book
[56:17] here but he makes it very clear that
[56:19] this dying lamb was not a second or a
[56:22] third person this was God
[56:26] by faith we walk up and place our hands
[56:30] upon that lamb and you know that's the
[56:33] hardest thing for a Believer isn't it to
[56:36] be able to walk up and place our hands
[56:38] upon that lamb and say that our sin is
[56:40] dealt with one time once and for all our
[56:45] sin is
[56:46] over it's almost impossible for us to do
[56:49] that and maybe we would say well how
[56:51] come do we have to repent and and die to
[56:54] ourselves daily because the old man
[56:55] wants to live
[56:57] but the sin bill has been completely
[57:00] settled and paid for but Satan wants to
[57:02] make us feel like no no no it isn't
[57:04] you've got something that you need to do
[57:05] and the only thing that we need to do is
[57:07] accept that he did it not try and do
[57:09] something on our own and the more we do
[57:12] that the more humbling it becomes
[57:14] because we recognize there's nothing
[57:16] that we did to deserve this that's why
[57:19] it's so interesting the more revelated
[57:22] people get the more humble truly humble
[57:25] they become
[57:26] because they can see it clearer and
[57:28] clearer there's nothing they've done
[57:30] there's nothing they could ever do
[57:32] there's nothing that anybody could ever
[57:34] do it's all God it's all
[57:36] Grace he says we see him with the bloody
[57:40] wounds the lacerated back the cruel
[57:42] Thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain
[57:46] and hear him cry my God my God why hast
[57:49] Thou
[57:51] forsaken
[57:53] me and what happened
[57:56] the
[57:57] life that left that broken blood cell
[58:00] came back upon the repentant
[58:03] one but first that life went and
[58:08] destroyed the veil separating man and
[58:11] God went right to the temple and said
[58:14] your form of worship is
[58:17] over the life that was in him came back
[58:20] Upon Us amen we go back with no more
[58:25] desire to sin
[58:26] and we now possess a hatred for the
[58:29] works and lusts of the Flesh and that's
[58:32] what causes us to repent because we hate
[58:34] this flesh this flesh wants to sin this
[58:38] hybrid nature wants to sin yes and oh
[58:41] the devil makes it seem so fun so smooth
[58:45] right so
[58:47] enticing but this flesh isn't what rules
[58:50] because if we walk after the flesh we
[58:52] die
[58:54] right they that walk not after the flesh
[58:57] but after the
[58:59] spirit paragraph 111 look at us what is
[59:02] our life just one little cell that came
[59:05] from our father the female does not have
[59:08] the hemoglobin she produces the egg
[59:10] she's the incubator but the blood comes
[59:13] from the male that is why the woman
[59:15] takes the man's name the children take
[59:18] his name the mother is the incubator for
[59:21] the children she Bears
[59:24] him the that is what happened for our
[59:28] Redemption the Holy Ghost Came Upon Mary
[59:31] and she bore a son and called him Jesus
[59:34] the great Creator came down and became a
[59:37] sacrifice for our sin his blood was the
[59:41] blood of
[59:42] God I don't know how you can dispute
[59:44] that just tear that page out I guess
[59:47] just say it doesn't apply or whatever
[59:50] that is exactly what it was it had to
[59:53] be that blood of God was shed dead and
[59:56] the spirit left him as he died in
[1:00:02] agony then the same life Spirit came
[1:00:05] back to indwell the repentant Sinner and
[1:00:08] set him free that sinner did not come
[1:00:12] back year after year sacrifice after
[1:00:15] sacrifice for there was no need by one
[1:00:17] sacrifice once and for all he has been
[1:00:20] set free from the Dominion of sin and
[1:00:23] has received the Life of Christ where by
[1:00:26] He reigns in victory over sin Over The
[1:00:29] World the Flesh and the
[1:00:33] devil I think it's so
[1:00:35] beautiful I just
[1:00:37] was in uh in a study last night and
[1:00:43] we're studying the seven the exposition
[1:00:45] of the seven Church ages but uh you know
[1:00:49] brother bradam he says that in another
[1:00:50] place in in this uh in this book and
[1:00:55] it's just it's just amazing out of the
[1:00:59] uh revelation of Jesus Christ right at
[1:01:01] the very
[1:01:03] beginning he says it in paragraph 123 of
[1:01:06] this book you don't have to go there
[1:01:07] right now I'm just going to say it just
[1:01:09] because it was it's interesting I was
[1:01:11] just studying it last night but it's the
[1:01:12] exact same thing he says right now we
[1:01:14] reign with Christ having dominion over
[1:01:16] sin the World the Flesh and the devil I
[1:01:20] remember brother Ken preaching that so
[1:01:22] clearly we have that right now brothers
[1:01:24] and sisters we're not going going to
[1:01:26] attain to it someday we've got that
[1:01:28] right now through the blood of Jesus
[1:01:30] Christ which was God's own blood if it
[1:01:33] wasn't God's own blood then we're done
[1:01:35] for we might as well pack up and go
[1:01:37] home but it was God's blood amen such a
[1:01:41] beautiful
[1:01:42] thing I I just think it's wonderful to
[1:01:45] think that we have dominion over that we
[1:01:47] don't have to worry about Satan coming
[1:01:49] around and trying to make us think that
[1:01:51] we're we're we're not actually able to
[1:01:54] overcome this
[1:01:56] it was God that did it and he did it so
[1:01:58] that we could overcome all of those
[1:02:00] things amen now I went and lost my
[1:02:06] place I do
[1:02:10] apologize bear with me for a
[1:02:17] second there we go paragraph 116 God did
[1:02:20] it I'll just go back and read the last
[1:02:22] sentence it's so good he reigns in
[1:02:24] victory over sin
[1:02:27] over the world over the Flesh and the
[1:02:30] devil God did it he did it all he cried
[1:02:35] out to the world the world cursed in sin
[1:02:39] I will give you a sign a virgin shall be
[1:02:43] with child a virgin shall conceive and
[1:02:45] bear a son that will be your sign it
[1:02:48] will be an everlasting sign what she
[1:02:51] brings forth will be Emmanuel God With
[1:02:55] Us
[1:02:56] God came down in a blood cell not
[1:02:58] through a man but by the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:02] in excuse me that virgin womb a
[1:03:04] tabernacle for the purpose of death was
[1:03:07] built the seat of the woman came in
[1:03:10] order that he be bruised to bring us our
[1:03:15] Salvation when the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:03:17] Mary he created within her womb that
[1:03:19] cell that would multiply and become the
[1:03:22] body of Our Lord that cell was created
[1:03:26] it was the beginning of the creation of
[1:03:29] God that is who Jesus is and that Holy
[1:03:33] One was filled with Holy Blood even the
[1:03:37] blood of
[1:03:38] God that Tabernacle came to birth he
[1:03:42] grew to be a man he went to
[1:03:46] Jordan and there that sacrifice was
[1:03:49] washed of John in the river called
[1:03:52] Jordan when that acceptable sacrifice
[1:03:55] rose out of the water God came and
[1:03:57] indwelt him filling him with the spirit
[1:04:00] without
[1:04:02] measure I just thought it was so
[1:04:04] interesting I just have to throw this in
[1:04:05] there isn't it isn't it interesting to
[1:04:07] think about that life that was in that
[1:04:10] blood that was in Mary that life was so
[1:04:14] powerful in that blood that was in Mary
[1:04:16] even with just a few little cells there
[1:04:18] that at the name of Jesus in the ears of
[1:04:22] her cousin
[1:04:25] she actually got baptized with the Holy
[1:04:28] Ghost right there John was filled with B
[1:04:32] with the Holy Ghost right there baptized
[1:04:33] with the Holy Ghost right there Just
[1:04:35] Amazing Just those little cells that
[1:04:37] blood that life in the blood and when he
[1:04:41] died and shed his blood the perfect life
[1:04:43] of God was liberated to come back upon
[1:04:46] the sinner who would accept the Christ
[1:04:48] as his savior just have to accept it oh
[1:04:52] how striking it is now I love this part
[1:04:55] he gets in to to say in some stuff here
[1:04:57] how striking it is Jehovah born crying
[1:05:01] over a manure pile Jehovah born in a
[1:05:04] manger of straw there is your
[1:05:06] Everlasting sign to the proud and puffed
[1:05:09] up pseudo intellectuals that have
[1:05:12] evolved their own Theology and denied
[1:05:14] the truth of god Jehovah God a crying
[1:05:18] baby in a stinking Barn not another
[1:05:22] person then we think we have a right to
[1:05:25] be proud holding up our noses
[1:05:27] criticizing and acting as though we were
[1:05:29] somebody here's your real sign this is
[1:05:32] the right one Jehovah playing as a boy
[1:05:36] Jehovah working in a carpenter shop
[1:05:39] Jehovah washing the feet of
[1:05:42] fishermen I will give you a sign said
[1:05:45] God not the sign of a white-collared
[1:05:48] priesthood not the sign of wealth and
[1:05:51] power there's nothing in this sign that
[1:05:54] you will want or think
[1:05:57] suitable
[1:05:59] nothing but it's an everlasting sign
[1:06:03] it's the greatest sign of all Jehovah
[1:06:05] standing in the courtyard bruised and
[1:06:08] bleeding with thorns on his brow and
[1:06:11] spit on his face mocked and said it not
[1:06:15] Jehovah despised and rejected hanging
[1:06:19] naked upon the cross while the
[1:06:22] Hypocrites Jered and dared him to come
[1:06:25] down off the
[1:06:29] cross sometimes you just hear it you
[1:06:32] read it you just can't even really
[1:06:38] exactly there's going to be some
[1:06:40] conversation one
[1:06:41] day about that very thing Jehovah dying
[1:06:46] Jehovah praying and nothing
[1:06:48] happening can you
[1:06:51] imagine then Jehovah
[1:06:54] died that is the sign for all men now
[1:06:58] there isn't another like it it is the
[1:07:00] great
[1:07:01] one I think that's important for us to
[1:07:03] just dwell on we need to maybe think
[1:07:05] about this this just really struck me
[1:07:08] while I was studying it and I thought
[1:07:09] you know maybe sometimes we just need to
[1:07:11] remember this even Jehovah prayed and
[1:07:16] nothing
[1:07:18] happened our prayers don't get answered
[1:07:22] like that it's not instant gratification
[1:07:24] brothers and sisters we can't
[1:07:26] just have fast prayers fast food prayer
[1:07:30] it doesn't work that way sometimes he
[1:07:32] doesn't answer for our
[1:07:35] benefit
[1:07:36] amen then Darkness Came Upon the Earth
[1:07:40] they put him in a tomb there he lay
[1:07:42] those three days and nights until an
[1:07:44] earthquake shattered the Gloom of night
[1:07:47] and he came
[1:07:49] forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah
[1:07:54] ascended on high then Jehovah returned
[1:07:57] to indwell his
[1:08:00] church it's not second third anyone
[1:08:03] Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing
[1:08:06] wind and flames of fire Jehovah came
[1:08:09] back to walk in the midst of his church
[1:08:12] and Empower his people amen don't put it
[1:08:16] off on the prophet yes sir don't put it
[1:08:19] off on some future day don't look back
[1:08:23] he did all that so that you could have
[1:08:25] the power
[1:08:27] tonight once more Jehovah came and this
[1:08:30] time to stay in his
[1:08:34] people and again Jehovah heals the sick
[1:08:37] raises the dead and manifests himself by
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:41] spirit Jehovah came back speaking in
[1:08:46] tongues and giving the answer back in
[1:08:49] interpretation
[1:08:51] amen I love this Jehovah came down and
[1:08:55] he raised Ed The Prostitute to sin no
[1:08:58] more sir he came down to the drunkard
[1:09:02] with fly blows on his face as he lay
[1:09:05] unconscious in the gutter now brothers
[1:09:08] and sisters one day I'll give you my
[1:09:11] testimony that's me that's me I know
[1:09:15] what that's
[1:09:16] like he came down to my
[1:09:20] gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in
[1:09:23] flesh and manifest
[1:09:26] through flesh Jehovah came God in us the
[1:09:31] hope of
[1:09:32] glory I just can't help but think
[1:09:34] brothers and sisters he has come down so
[1:09:36] that he can manifest through our flesh
[1:09:40] so that we can find those last
[1:09:42] predestinated seeds so that we can go
[1:09:44] and witness and encourage those people
[1:09:46] who maybe are a little bit Wayward
[1:09:48] they're a little bit way late far be it
[1:09:51] from us as the truly revelated mature
[1:09:55] believer Bel to be scorning at people
[1:09:57] for not coming to church our job is to
[1:10:00] encourage them not discourage them and
[1:10:03] shame on us if we ever encouraged or
[1:10:06] discouraged anyone to not come to church
[1:10:09] because they haven't been coming to
[1:10:11] church we should only be encouraging for
[1:10:14] people that have been discouraged what's
[1:10:16] the best way to uh get rid of
[1:10:19] discouragement
[1:10:21] encouragement just simply encourage
[1:10:23] people you get more bees with honey to
[1:10:25] go and shame somebody because they
[1:10:27] haven't come to church what does that
[1:10:30] do it Puffs us up because we feel like
[1:10:33] well we've come to church and I've been
[1:10:34] there every service and I ain't seen you
[1:10:36] why haven't you been there what does
[1:10:38] that do to them it makes them feel low
[1:10:40] makes them feel
[1:10:44] bad we're here so that he can manifest
[1:10:47] through us so that we can encourage
[1:10:49] others to come and experience to taste
[1:10:52] of the fruit of the land the pomegranate
[1:10:55] and the
[1:10:56] figs the honey and the
[1:10:59] milk if we're over in that promised land
[1:11:01] that
[1:11:02] is paragraph 122 he says yes Jesus came
[1:11:06] and shed his blood and set the captive
[1:11:08] free he came and redeemed his lost sheep
[1:11:12] he gave them eternal life and they shall
[1:11:14] never perish he won't lose one of them
[1:11:18] but raise them up at the last day
[1:11:21] Hallelujah the second death cannot hurt
[1:11:23] them it has no power over them for they
[1:11:27] are the Lambs and they will follow him
[1:11:30] wherever he goes now remember he's
[1:11:32] talking to every single Church age here
[1:11:34] he's not just talking about that age the
[1:11:36] samian church age we can put it off by a
[1:11:38] statement like that and say well he's
[1:11:39] just talking about them no he's not he
[1:11:40] says it on every single Church age this
[1:11:42] is applicable in every single age the
[1:11:46] holy spirit in every age what a
[1:11:49] coincidence Revelations 2:11 he that
[1:11:51] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:11:53] saith unto the church churches there is
[1:11:56] not one Church age where this verse is
[1:11:58] not mentioned every single age has the
[1:12:02] same admonition to the people of every
[1:12:07] age he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:12:11] what the spirit saith but it's
[1:12:13] absolutely impossible for all men to
[1:12:15] hear what the spirit says to the
[1:12:17] different ages so isn't it wonderful to
[1:12:20] think brothers and sisters tonight I was
[1:12:21] just having a little Jubilee thinking
[1:12:23] reading this we have the ability to hear
[1:12:25] this we've got every single reason to
[1:12:26] jump and Shout to beat the tambourine up
[1:12:29] and down the bank of the river knowing
[1:12:31] that the horse and Riders drown in the
[1:12:32] sea our enemy is gone he has saved us
[1:12:36] he's redeemed Us by his own blood we've
[1:12:38] got every reason to sing and shout to
[1:12:40] Rejoice to know what he's done for us
[1:12:44] because we have the ear to hear it it
[1:12:46] doesn't do anything for us to say that
[1:12:48] we've got the ear and and we don't give
[1:12:51] praise for it but just to recognize it
[1:12:54] it just is so
[1:12:56] amazing 1 Corinthians 2:
[1:13:00] 6-16 how be it we speak wisdom among
[1:13:03] them that are perfect yet not the wisdom
[1:13:06] of this world nor of the princes of this
[1:13:09] world that come to not but we speak the
[1:13:12] wisdom of God in a mystery amen
[1:13:16] my many people love
[1:13:19] mysteries even the hidden wisdom which
[1:13:22] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:13:26] Glory which none of the princes of this
[1:13:28] world knew for had they known it they
[1:13:31] would not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:13:34] Glory but as it is written eye hath Not
[1:13:36] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[1:13:40] into the heart of man the things which
[1:13:42] God hath prepared for them that love
[1:13:46] him but God hath
[1:13:49] revealed revealed them unto us by his
[1:13:53] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:13:56] things yay the Deep things of God and I
[1:14:01] just thought you know real soon I
[1:14:03] couldn't do it this afternoon when I was
[1:14:06] thinking about this but uh real soon I
[1:14:09] just want to sit down and watch the Deep
[1:14:11] calleth to the
[1:14:13] Deep we we mustn't take that for granted
[1:14:16] that's one of the videos that we could
[1:14:18] actually see where we have the
[1:14:20] Vindicated Prophet the mouthpiece of God
[1:14:23] to this age the culmination of all the
[1:14:26] ages if there's a deep calling brothers
[1:14:28] and sisters there is a deep to respond
[1:14:31] and you know what we have the things of
[1:14:33] God revealed unto us by his spirit amen
[1:14:37] and how do we get his Spirit how do we
[1:14:39] truly get the true baptism of the Holy
[1:14:41] Spirit by following the word by getting
[1:14:44] back in line exactly the way this
[1:14:46] Vindicated Prophet said just get
[1:14:48] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:14:52] according to the word of God and you'll
[1:14:54] receive theol Holy Ghost the spirit and
[1:14:56] that spirit searcheth all things yay the
[1:14:59] Deep things of God for what man knoweth
[1:15:02] the things of a man save the spirit of
[1:15:04] man which is in him even to the things
[1:15:07] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[1:15:10] God now we have received not the spirit
[1:15:13] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:15:16] god that we might know the things that
[1:15:18] are freely given to us of God oh
[1:15:22] my which things also we speak not in
[1:15:24] words Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[1:15:27] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:15:31] comparing spiritual things with
[1:15:33] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:15:36] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:15:39] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:15:41] can he know them because they are
[1:15:45] spiritually
[1:15:46] discerned but he that is spiritual
[1:15:50] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[1:15:54] judged of no man for who hath known the
[1:15:57] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:16:01] him oh my but we have the mind of
[1:16:06] Christ we followed the word the word
[1:16:09] that said let this mind be in you that
[1:16:12] mind that was in Christ Jesus and who is
[1:16:15] Christ Jesus we just heard brother
[1:16:16] bradam explain it from the blood cell
[1:16:19] from the word to the to the to the
[1:16:21] Virgin to the blood cell Jehovah Jehovah
[1:16:25] Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah it's not
[1:16:28] another spirit it's not another person
[1:16:30] it's not nothing else it's Jehovah
[1:16:33] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[1:16:36] because this is Matthew 1313 to6
[1:16:39] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[1:16:41] because they seeing see not and hearing
[1:16:44] they hear not neither do they understand
[1:16:46] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:16:50] Isaias which saith by hearing you shall
[1:16:53] hear and not understand and seeing you
[1:16:55] shall see and not
[1:16:57] perceive for this people's heart is
[1:17:00] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:17:04] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[1:17:08] lest at any time they should see with
[1:17:10] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[1:17:12] should understand with their heart and
[1:17:15] should be converted and I should heal
[1:17:17] them but blessed are your eyes for they
[1:17:20] see and your ears for they hear
[1:17:23] mine John
[1:17:27] 84244 Jesus said unto them if God were
[1:17:30] your father you would love
[1:17:33] me can you imagine that those people
[1:17:35] disputing with
[1:17:36] him if God were your father you would
[1:17:39] love me because I am
[1:17:42] God Jesus said unto them if God were
[1:17:45] your father ye would love me for I
[1:17:48] proceeded forth and came from God
[1:17:51] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[1:17:56] amen why do ye not understand my speech
[1:17:59] even because you cannot bear my
[1:18:02] word year of your father the
[1:18:05] devil can't even imagine that and the
[1:18:09] lust of your father ye will do he was a
[1:18:12] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[1:18:14] not in the truth because there is no
[1:18:16] truth in
[1:18:18] him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh
[1:18:22] of his own for he is a li
[1:18:25] and the father of
[1:18:28] it it's most evident from these
[1:18:30] scriptures that no man of himself can
[1:18:34] hear God that ability has to be given
[1:18:38] him of
[1:18:40] God Matthew 16:17 and Jesus answered and
[1:18:43] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[1:18:45] barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:18:47] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:18:51] which is in
[1:18:52] heaven putting these verses together we
[1:18:55] see that there is only one group of
[1:18:57] people and that a very special group of
[1:19:02] people who are able to hear what the
[1:19:04] spirit says in each
[1:19:07] age it's one special group that receives
[1:19:10] the Revelation for each age and that
[1:19:13] group is the elect now brothers and
[1:19:16] sisters it's one thing to say that I
[1:19:18] have an ear to hear I can hear what the
[1:19:19] spirit says I can hear that God sent a
[1:19:20] prophet I can hear the message of the
[1:19:22] hour I can hear the seals I can hear all
[1:19:24] the Mysteries I've heard it my whole
[1:19:26] life I was raised in it I know it amen
[1:19:29] but can you live
[1:19:31] it because that's the evidence amen the
[1:19:34] evidence is being able to walk the walk
[1:19:36] not just talk the talk amen it's pretty
[1:19:38] easy to talk but we've got to be able to
[1:19:41] walk the walk that one special group out
[1:19:44] of every single age is the elect and
[1:19:47] unfortunately many of the ages they had
[1:19:49] to walk themselves to their death to
[1:19:52] prove who they were we we have to
[1:19:55] actually walk away from ourselves we
[1:19:57] have to divorce our old nature we've got
[1:20:00] to be willing to sacrifice everything
[1:20:02] inside this old man and let every single
[1:20:05] Speck of him die so that he could live
[1:20:09] Hallelujah the interesting thing is with
[1:20:11] every single age there's always a death
[1:20:13] a sacrificial death now we don't lay
[1:20:15] down our lives and die to actually
[1:20:18] create a sacrifice that would be
[1:20:20] acceptable unto God although we do
[1:20:24] sacrifice our nature our spirit has got
[1:20:27] to die every single Speck of the old
[1:20:29] man's got to
[1:20:31] go that group is of God because the
[1:20:35] group that cannot
[1:20:37] hear is not of God John 842 to 44 we
[1:20:42] just read the scripture the group that
[1:20:44] can and does hear what the spirit is
[1:20:46] saying and receives the Revelation
[1:20:48] thereof is that group described in 1
[1:20:53] Corinthians 2:6 to6
[1:20:55] 16 they are the ones who have the spirit
[1:20:58] of God they are the ones that are born
[1:21:00] of God they are baptized into the body
[1:21:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit
[1:21:06] they are baptized with the Holy
[1:21:10] Ghost to further bring out what we have
[1:21:12] just said and to also use a scripture
[1:21:15] that should be borne in mind as we talk
[1:21:18] about who it is that is baptized with
[1:21:21] the Holy Ghost see what Jesus said in
[1:21:25] John 6 and Isaiah
[1:21:28] 5413 whence this is taken John 6:45 it
[1:21:32] is written in the prophets and they
[1:21:34] shall all be taught of God Isaiah
[1:21:39] 54:13 and all thy children shall be
[1:21:43] taught of the
[1:21:45] Lord the all of God are the children of
[1:21:50] God Amen thus it is that the evidence of
[1:21:54] being a true child of God he whom the
[1:21:58] spirit has come upon and
[1:22:01] indwells is again set forth as one
[1:22:05] taught the word by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:09] Hallelujah now you can begin to see why
[1:22:12] tongues is not the evidence of being
[1:22:14] baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't
[1:22:18] say in any age that he that hath a
[1:22:21] tongue let him say what the spirit is
[1:22:24] saying saying that puts tongues
[1:22:26] interpretation thereof and prophesying
[1:22:29] Etc aside as an Evidence the evidence is
[1:22:34] hearing what the spirit says the spirit
[1:22:38] is talking yes the spirit is
[1:22:41] teaching that is exactly what Jesus said
[1:22:44] he would do when he
[1:22:46] came John
[1:22:48] 1426 he will teach you all things and
[1:22:51] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:22:53] amen what whatsoever I have said unto
[1:22:58] you not another word the only thing he
[1:23:02] did when he came that that teacher the
[1:23:04] comforter that instructor as he just
[1:23:06] pointed back to what Jesus said Jehovah
[1:23:08] said through Jesus Jehovah in flesh he
[1:23:12] just pointed back to the word and that's
[1:23:14] all that this Prophet for our day did
[1:23:16] and that's all that we want to do is
[1:23:18] just point back to the word amen to the
[1:23:20] word to the word it's got to be the word
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:25] and that is just what happened that is
[1:23:27] how the gospels were written these men
[1:23:29] had recalled to their minds by the Holy
[1:23:32] Ghost the very words that Jesus spake
[1:23:36] that is why the gospels are accurate
[1:23:39] they are
[1:23:40] perfect but the spirit did not only
[1:23:43] bring did not only bring all things to
[1:23:46] their minds but he taught them further
[1:23:49] on the truth they already had and you
[1:23:52] know brothers and sisters he still
[1:23:54] teaching us further about the truth we
[1:23:57] already
[1:23:59] have and the only thing that's happening
[1:24:01] is we're just saying Amen to the word
[1:24:03] we're saying Amen to the message every
[1:24:05] time we listen to a message we hear
[1:24:07] something new in the same message we've
[1:24:09] already heard 100,000 times over but we
[1:24:11] just say Amen there's something else
[1:24:13] there that's the spirit speaking to us
[1:24:17] amen it's the internal teacher he's the
[1:24:19] one teaching
[1:24:21] us that is how Paul received his
[1:24:23] Revelations he was was taught by the
[1:24:25] Holy Ghost he said concerning it in
[1:24:27] Galatians 1:11-12 but I certify you
[1:24:31] Brethren that the gospel which was
[1:24:34] preached of me is not after man for I
[1:24:37] neither received it of man neither was I
[1:24:39] taught it of man but by the revelation
[1:24:42] of Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ and I just I love that I love
[1:24:48] hearing that I love knowing that we just
[1:24:50] simply preach what Paul preached that's
[1:24:52] it we're not trying to put a new spin on
[1:24:54] it man we're just going back to what the
[1:24:55] word said to what Paul preached and he
[1:24:58] just said it I wasn't taught this no man
[1:25:00] taught me Gia never taught me this I
[1:25:02] never learned it in the synagogue God
[1:25:04] taught me this Jehovah God spoke to me
[1:25:07] when I was on my road to go and slay his
[1:25:10] Saints he stopped me in my tracks by the
[1:25:13] pillar of fire and he said you know what
[1:25:16] Paul Saul it's hard for you to kick
[1:25:18] against the Pricks you need to just
[1:25:20] follow the instruction that I give you
[1:25:21] and we know that's what he did that's
[1:25:23] the one we follow amen paragraph 131 one
[1:25:27] day when Jesus was upon Earth a certain
[1:25:30] important man came to visit him this man
[1:25:32] said Rabbi we know you are a teacher
[1:25:34] sent from God but you will notice that
[1:25:36] Jesus cut him short he turned to
[1:25:39] Nicodemus and the words he spoke May
[1:25:43] well be paraphrased
[1:25:45] thusly I am not a teacher I am the
[1:25:49] sacrificial lamb for
[1:25:51] sin I am making possible the new Birth
[1:25:54] by my spirit but there is one coming who
[1:25:58] is the
[1:25:59] teacher he is the holy spirit amen when
[1:26:04] Jesus was upon the Earth he came as the
[1:26:08] lamb and as the prophet amen but when he
[1:26:12] came back upon the church by his Spirit
[1:26:15] he became the
[1:26:17] teacher and to every age we hear the
[1:26:20] same truth he that hath an ear let him
[1:26:21] hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:26:23] churches but only a Spirit-filled man
[1:26:26] can hear the Revelation for that age
[1:26:31] amen that's pretty
[1:26:34] cutting because what comes
[1:26:38] first the believer or the
[1:26:41] spirit goes on to say none other can no
[1:26:44] sir they cannot because that is exactly
[1:26:48] what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2 verse
[1:26:52] 6-16
[1:26:54] paragraph 133 now this ought to make you
[1:26:57] rejoice there is a most peculiar
[1:26:59] Doctrine in the air that is causing much
[1:27:01] misunder understanding and hard feelings
[1:27:04] for when the Pentecostals say You must
[1:27:06] speak in tongues or you haven't been
[1:27:09] baptized with the Holy Ghost they are
[1:27:12] either denying that great men like Knox
[1:27:14] Moody Taylor go forth and others did not
[1:27:18] receive the holy ghost or saying that
[1:27:20] they all secretly spoke in tongues and
[1:27:24] were not aware of what was going on now
[1:27:27] that's not true no sir that's gross
[1:27:30] error tongues are not the evidence of
[1:27:34] being Spirit-filled
[1:27:36] you know I I was raised with that
[1:27:39] ideology that tongues are the initial
[1:27:41] evidence that that was it it was in my
[1:27:44] fiber you know how brother bradam said
[1:27:46] it you give give the Catholic Church
[1:27:48] said give us a child to age what five
[1:27:51] and we'll have him for life I was in the
[1:27:53] church the Pentecostal Church church
[1:27:54] till age probably 10 12 somewhere in
[1:27:57] there this was something that I had to
[1:27:59] overcome I had to get the Revelation
[1:28:02] from God to understand that the word of
[1:28:04] God says that there's other spiritual
[1:28:06] gifts it's not just one and in fact when
[1:28:09] you hear the prophet talk about it and
[1:28:10] then you read it in the Bible you have
[1:28:12] to say wow the tongues is actually the
[1:28:15] least of the
[1:28:16] gifts but you'd base an entire salvation
[1:28:20] on the fact that you actually are able
[1:28:22] to speak in tongues
[1:28:24] oh my it's not even in the
[1:28:27] word I love the way he just brings it
[1:28:29] out
[1:28:30] here tongues is not the evidence of
[1:28:33] being Spirit-filled
[1:28:34] it's simply one of the nine
[1:28:37] manifestations mentioned in First
[1:28:39] Corinthians
[1:28:41] 12 I just wanted to pause there just for
[1:28:44] a few minutes tonight I hope it's okay
[1:28:46] let's just turn over there just just to
[1:28:48] shine a flashlight on this amen because
[1:28:52] brother random he doesn't talk about
[1:28:53] them all here but I just think it's
[1:28:58] important sometimes just to point to the
[1:29:01] word just point to the
[1:29:06] word so what he's referencing here is 1
[1:29:10] Corinthians 12 there's no scripture that
[1:29:12] says you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:29:15] speaking in tongues or that you receive
[1:29:17] the Holy Spirit by speaking in
[1:29:21] tongues 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:29:25] this is Paul speaking to the Corinthian
[1:29:28] Church now concerning spiritual gifts
[1:29:31] Brethren I would not have you ignorant
[1:29:34] and we know that Paul was not the author
[1:29:37] of this Paul was the
[1:29:40] Scribe it was the Holy Spirit Penning
[1:29:44] these words amen so when you hear I this
[1:29:48] is god Jehovah that one we've been
[1:29:50] talking about all night now concerning
[1:29:53] spiritual gifts Brethren I would not
[1:29:55] have you ignorant ye know that ye were
[1:29:58] Gentiles carried away unto these dumb
[1:30:00] Idols even as ye were LED wherefore I
[1:30:03] gave you to understand that no man
[1:30:06] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[1:30:08] Jesus a cursed and that no man can say
[1:30:11] that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost amen now there are diversities of
[1:30:18] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[1:30:21] differences of Administrations but the
[1:30:24] same lord and there are diversities of
[1:30:28] operations but it is the same God which
[1:30:31] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:30:34] of the spirit is given to every man to
[1:30:38] profit with all for to one is given by
[1:30:42] the spirit the word of wisdom so I just
[1:30:45] reading this I would think automatically
[1:30:47] the word of wisdom being the first one
[1:30:48] that's mentioned is actually the most
[1:30:51] important wouldn't not be the most
[1:30:53] important to think having a little bit
[1:30:55] of wisdom spiritually speaking that
[1:30:57] would go a long ways wouldn't it for to
[1:30:59] one is given by the spirit the word of
[1:31:01] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[1:31:04] by The Same Spirit to another Faith by
[1:31:08] The Same Spirit to another the gifts of
[1:31:11] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[1:31:14] the working of Miracles to another
[1:31:16] prophecy to another Discerning of
[1:31:18] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[1:31:21] tongues and to another the interpret
[1:31:24] ration of tongues so the speaking in
[1:31:27] tongues and the interpretation of
[1:31:28] tongues are like that in the
[1:31:31] church but all these worketh that one
[1:31:35] and the self Same Spirit dividing to
[1:31:37] every man severly as he will amen for as
[1:31:41] the body is one and hath many members
[1:31:43] and all the members of that one body
[1:31:46] being many are one body so also is
[1:31:51] Christ for by one spirit we are all
[1:31:54] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:31:56] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:31:59] free or have been all made and have been
[1:32:04] all made to drink into one spirit
[1:32:09] amen so talking about tongues are not
[1:32:14] the evidence of being Spirit-filled it
[1:32:16] is simply one of the nine manifestations
[1:32:19] we just read nine manifestations
[1:32:22] mentioned in 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:32:24] there is no scripture that says you
[1:32:26] receive the Holy Spirit speaking in
[1:32:29] tongues or that you receive the Holy
[1:32:32] Spirit by speaking in tongues but it
[1:32:35] does say that after they were all filled
[1:32:38] with the Holy Ghost they spake in
[1:32:41] tongues and later on it says that they
[1:32:46] prophesied today many
[1:32:48] folks today amongst many folks sorry it
[1:32:52] is taken for granted that all all who
[1:32:54] claim to receive the Holy Ghost by
[1:32:57] speaking in tongues speak in a genuine
[1:33:00] spiritual tongue but this is not so for
[1:33:05] many PE many people speak in a known
[1:33:08] tongue but under the influence of a
[1:33:11] wrong
[1:33:12] spirit I heard a story once when I was
[1:33:15] growing up in the Pentecostal
[1:33:18] ranks it just made me laugh when I heard
[1:33:22] it as uh believer today but uh when I
[1:33:27] think about it
[1:33:28] anyways they had an altar call and there
[1:33:31] was a young man that wanted to get the
[1:33:32] Holy Ghost but didn't really feel led to
[1:33:34] come up and they had an evangelist and
[1:33:36] he was a fire and brimstone preacher and
[1:33:38] this is many years ago the fire and
[1:33:40] brimstone preacher called him
[1:33:43] out called him up and said you want to
[1:33:46] receive the Holy Ghost and he didn't say
[1:33:48] it quiet like that and he got him up
[1:33:51] there and he put his hand on him and
[1:33:53] started jumping and shaking and fitting
[1:33:56] and said the guy actually started to
[1:34:00] speak in German he had a second tongue
[1:34:02] he started to speak in German just so
[1:34:04] the guy would leave him
[1:34:06] alone and he did he was like wow you got
[1:34:09] it you got it praise the Lord and he was
[1:34:11] like yeah see you
[1:34:15] later but just because you have a
[1:34:17] different tongue it doesn't mean that
[1:34:19] you're actually speaking by the spirit
[1:34:23] brother Bram says for many people speak
[1:34:25] in a known tongue but under the
[1:34:27] influence of a wrong
[1:34:30] Spirit now let's say we are in a meeting
[1:34:33] and people are all speaking in tongues
[1:34:36] how can you tell which tongue is from
[1:34:39] the spirit and which is from the
[1:34:42] devil have you have you spoken to people
[1:34:44] that speak in
[1:34:46] tongues I think we talked about this
[1:34:48] last time or one of these times they'll
[1:34:50] just be talking to you and then they'll
[1:34:51] start to testify and then they'll start
[1:34:53] to go off in an unknown language and
[1:34:56] then they'll face back in and be
[1:34:57] speaking English again and there's no
[1:34:59] interpretation of it but you got to
[1:35:01] wonder what they just
[1:35:04] say brother bradam says I have been
[1:35:06] almost the Heathen I have been amongst
[1:35:10] sorry not almost forgive me I have been
[1:35:12] amongst the Heathen where the Wizards
[1:35:14] drank blood out of a human skull so I'm
[1:35:18] just going to go back I jumped ahead
[1:35:20] brother Ram says now let's say we are at
[1:35:22] a meeting and people are all speaking in
[1:35:25] tongues how do you know which tongue is
[1:35:27] from the spirit and which is from the
[1:35:30] devil it's amazing because he's saying
[1:35:32] there's two types of tongues I have been
[1:35:36] amongst the Heathen where the Wizards
[1:35:38] drank blood out of a skull spoken
[1:35:40] tongues and interpreted and
[1:35:41] prophesied they can even write in
[1:35:44] tongues now if
[1:35:47] tongues is the evidence of receiving the
[1:35:49] Holy Ghost then every tongue would have
[1:35:52] to be of God right it's just so
[1:35:55] plain but it has been admitted by
[1:35:59] tongues evidence people that there are
[1:36:01] false and true tongues for God has the
[1:36:04] genuine and Satan has the false so my
[1:36:08] question is who knows what's
[1:36:11] real who understood the language to know
[1:36:14] what was
[1:36:16] spoken who has the gift of discernment
[1:36:18] to know but when we get those answers we
[1:36:22] will have something to go on but until
[1:36:24] then we have to wonder about the source
[1:36:26] of the
[1:36:28] tongues you can see right
[1:36:30] now that if you back up a tongue's
[1:36:33] evidence and don't know what is being
[1:36:36] said you have to finally come to the
[1:36:39] place where all tongues have to be of
[1:36:41] God that would lead us to then to
[1:36:44] believe that the devil cannot speak in
[1:36:46] tongues that is not so no not for a
[1:36:50] minute any true missionary on a foreign
[1:36:53] field knows only too well that Devils
[1:36:56] speak in other tongues the same as I
[1:37:00] know it by
[1:37:01] experience the Pentecostal theologians
[1:37:04] admit that they have no scripture
[1:37:06] setting forth that people speak with
[1:37:08] tongues when baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:37:12] they admit that they infer it from the
[1:37:15] experiences set forth in the book of
[1:37:17] Acts wherein three out of five times the
[1:37:21] people spoke with tongues and the they
[1:37:23] also say without any Scripture that
[1:37:26] there are two kinds of tongues one is
[1:37:29] the tongue you speak in while receiving
[1:37:32] the Holy Ghost and it is the evidence
[1:37:36] while later on if you believe you can
[1:37:39] receive the gift of tongues whereby you
[1:37:42] may speak
[1:37:44] often however they say once having
[1:37:47] spoken in tongues as the evidence of
[1:37:50] receiving you may never speak
[1:37:55] again it's just too confusing isn't
[1:37:58] it I I don't think that God wants his
[1:38:02] gospel his manifestation of gifts to be
[1:38:05] confusing in fact he said through Paul
[1:38:08] didn't he just say that I Brethren I
[1:38:10] would not have you ignorant concerning
[1:38:13] this but this is complicated
[1:38:16] man paragraph 139 once more we are
[1:38:19] anxious to know where this is found in
[1:38:21] the word if isn't there then God hath
[1:38:25] not spoken it and woe unto him who would
[1:38:28] add to that
[1:38:31] word how many can say Amen to that
[1:38:33] tonight amen but there is something in
[1:38:36] the word about this very subject that
[1:38:38] they ignore completely First Corinthians
[1:38:40] 13 it mentions tongues of men and
[1:38:43] angels these would be known and unknown
[1:38:48] tongues known and unknown tongues modern
[1:38:52] Pentecostal say they can receive the
[1:38:55] Holy Ghost speaking in unknown or
[1:38:58] Angelic
[1:39:00] tongues they have the cart before the
[1:39:02] horse for in Acts 2 the people spoke in
[1:39:05] a perfect dialect which even unbelievers
[1:39:09] heard and
[1:39:10] understood it's just so clear when you
[1:39:13] do it this way isn't
[1:39:16] it now when God is silent we had better
[1:39:19] be silent I've got that highlighted here
[1:39:22] but where he has spoken we had better
[1:39:24] speak to and say what he has already
[1:39:28] said he told us the evidence or what
[1:39:31] would happen after being baptized with
[1:39:33] the Holy Ghost was that we would have
[1:39:37] the teacher come and teach us all truth
[1:39:40] and that's what brother bradam can say
[1:39:43] the true evidence of the baptism of the
[1:39:45] Holy Ghost is to be able to say Amen to
[1:39:47] the word where it corrects me in culture
[1:39:50] where it corrects me in gender where it
[1:39:52] takes a hide off of my desires I don't
[1:39:56] like the the word of God the way it
[1:39:57] makes this flesh feel but it's not about
[1:40:00] this flesh it's about his spirit in this
[1:40:02] flesh his spirit in that soul that place
[1:40:05] that he created and and the true
[1:40:08] evidence is to be able to say Amen to
[1:40:10] the word and then subject this life to
[1:40:12] that Amen to the
[1:40:17] word just gets me
[1:40:19] excited he told us the evidence or what
[1:40:22] would happen after being baptized with
[1:40:23] the Holy Ghost was that we would have
[1:40:25] the inside teacher come and teach us all
[1:40:27] truth but that teacher was an inside
[1:40:30] teacher not an outside teacher not
[1:40:33] someone just teaching you to get on your
[1:40:34] knees and pray and just pray and just
[1:40:37] pray and eventually something will start
[1:40:39] to come up and you'll start to speak in
[1:40:40] an unknown tongue and then you'll have
[1:40:42] the Holy
[1:40:43] Ghost if the spirit wasn't inside you
[1:40:47] wouldn't hear the truth and receive it
[1:40:49] by Revelation if you heard it every
[1:40:51] moment of the day
[1:40:55] and there's many people brothers and
[1:40:56] sisters that don't have an ear to hear
[1:40:58] what the spirit says but they sure like
[1:41:00] the anointing in the message
[1:41:03] churches we just read it there that was
[1:41:06] a sign of the indwelling spirit in the
[1:41:09] days of Paul those who were filled with
[1:41:11] the Holy Ghost heard the word received
[1:41:13] it and lived by it amen they didn't just
[1:41:17] hear it they weren't just hearers they
[1:41:20] were
[1:41:22] doers though those who did not have the
[1:41:24] spirit heard it only as carnal
[1:41:27] men put a wrong interpretation on it and
[1:41:30] went on to sin and I want to say this
[1:41:33] the carnal men that hear the word they
[1:41:36] usually have a lot of conflict there's a
[1:41:38] lot of problems and issues and we've got
[1:41:41] situations that we just need to try and
[1:41:43] sort out and there's always something
[1:41:45] isn't there that's carnal man but when
[1:41:48] the spirit comes on the scene it changes
[1:41:51] that man amen from the inside out amen
[1:41:54] the problems that used to be problems
[1:41:56] they really don't matter anymore cuz the
[1:41:59] only thing that matters is
[1:42:01] Christ in every age and every age is the
[1:42:04] age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[1:42:07] Believer I say in every age the evidence
[1:42:12] was the
[1:42:13] same those who had the spirit the
[1:42:16] teacher heard the word and that spirit
[1:42:18] in them took the word and taught it
[1:42:21] revealed it to them
[1:42:24] and they were of the group that heard
[1:42:27] the
[1:42:28] messenger and his
[1:42:31] message and took it and
[1:42:35] what and lived
[1:42:37] it many people have taken this message
[1:42:40] and tried to live it and and try to live
[1:42:43] it and try to live it and try to live it
[1:42:46] and what happens when they're trying to
[1:42:47] live it is they typically become
[1:42:49] legalists and they point at everyone
[1:42:51] else and say you know what I never saw
[1:42:53] you in service last week you know what
[1:42:55] your hair is a little bit too long you
[1:42:57] know what you've got a beard you know
[1:42:58] what those rims on your car you know
[1:43:00] what your job you know what your
[1:43:02] location you know what you know what you
[1:43:03] know what get
[1:43:06] saved get out of that that that man-made
[1:43:09] light get out of the man-made conditions
[1:43:11] and get behind that inner Veil get
[1:43:14] Christ in your life and you won't be
[1:43:16] looking at all of the
[1:43:18] carnality we'll be looking at our
[1:43:21] brothers and we'll be saying
[1:43:23] that's Jesus Christ there's a seat of
[1:43:26] God in there we'll be looking at our
[1:43:28] sisters and we'll be saying praise the
[1:43:30] Lord that's Jesus Christ manifest in
[1:43:33] flesh right there am and you know what
[1:43:36] even if we bitterly disagree we'll still
[1:43:38] say amen God richly bless you we won't
[1:43:41] have to run away to different sides of
[1:43:42] the world there ain't going to be
[1:43:44] different zones in
[1:43:45] heaven it's not going to be different
[1:43:47] countries in heaven we're going to be
[1:43:49] all one
[1:43:51] body paragraph 142 I know it is a great
[1:43:55] temptation to refer back to the day of
[1:43:57] Pentecost and also to the day when the
[1:43:59] Holy Ghost fell in the house of
[1:44:01] Cornelius and then set those two
[1:44:04] identical experiences as the evidence of
[1:44:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but on
[1:44:08] each occasion the tongues were
[1:44:10] understood by the listeners that's
[1:44:14] right I just love this it just makes it
[1:44:17] so clear when you have someone just
[1:44:18] speaking to you and then they go off
[1:44:21] there's no interpretation you got to
[1:44:22] scratch your head
[1:44:24] and you want to say Lord help them give
[1:44:28] me a word fitly spoken that could
[1:44:29] actually maybe encourage them to your
[1:44:31] word to your spirit because you know you
[1:44:35] can see what's going on it doesn't give
[1:44:38] us occasion to actually throw off on
[1:44:40] people we have compassion for them this
[1:44:43] is a far cry from the modern Babble Of
[1:44:46] Confusion of Pentecostal
[1:44:48] meetings boy I feel like we could just
[1:44:50] keep going with this here my my my
[1:44:53] paragraph 143 and if this were not
[1:44:56] enough to persuade us to leave off such
[1:44:58] reasoning what will we do when we are
[1:45:02] confronted with the fact that people who
[1:45:05] have never spoken in tongues have some
[1:45:07] of the other eight manifestations in
[1:45:10] their
[1:45:12] lives such as the word of wisdom the
[1:45:15] Discerning of spirits the word of
[1:45:16] knowledge Faith healing and even
[1:45:19] Miracles and this observation is even
[1:45:22] more interesting in the light that
[1:45:25] tongues is the least of the nine
[1:45:28] gifts so when we see people who do not
[1:45:32] nor ever have spoken in tongues use
[1:45:35] greater gifts than those who do speak in
[1:45:37] tongues we must discount such a Doctrine
[1:45:40] even more completely than
[1:45:44] before so you can see now that we cannot
[1:45:47] afford to say what the Bible has not
[1:45:50] said we can't afford to do that
[1:45:54] when the scripture teaches us that the
[1:45:57] work of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:45:59] manifestation of that blessed person is
[1:46:02] to bring for to bring the truth of each
[1:46:06] age to the true seed of that age then we
[1:46:10] know that the spirit has to be abiding
[1:46:13] in the person or he cannot receive the
[1:46:17] truth for that time amen that is exactly
[1:46:21] correct
[1:46:23] and if these ages bring out anything
[1:46:26] they surely bring and bear out this
[1:46:29] truth I think that's just amazing I'm
[1:46:32] just going to go back and read that it's
[1:46:34] so powerful when the scripture teaches
[1:46:36] us that the work of the Holy Spirit I'll
[1:46:39] call them musicians when the scripture
[1:46:42] teaches us that the work of the Holy
[1:46:45] Spirit and the
[1:46:46] manifestation of that blessed person is
[1:46:49] to bring the truth of each age
[1:46:53] to the true seed of that age then we
[1:46:56] know that the spirit has to be abiding
[1:46:59] in the person or he cannot receive the
[1:47:02] truth for that time amen that is exactly
[1:47:06] correct and if these ages bring out
[1:47:09] anything they surely bring and bear out
[1:47:12] this truth now before we leave this
[1:47:15] subject I want to make myself very clear
[1:47:18] on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:21] is according to to the
[1:47:24] word so good whenever I hear brother
[1:47:27] randam talk like that it just makes my
[1:47:29] ears perk up I just think
[1:47:31] man he wants to make it clear he says
[1:47:34] it's not according to me and it's not
[1:47:37] according to
[1:47:39] you it can't be according to me it can't
[1:47:41] be according to you it can't be
[1:47:42] according to a
[1:47:44] theological Doctrine it can't be
[1:47:47] according to a a Bible College teaching
[1:47:50] it can't be according to tradition
[1:47:53] it can only be according to one thing
[1:47:55] it's not according to me it's not
[1:47:56] according to you it has to be according
[1:47:58] to thus sayeth the Lord or we are
[1:48:01] falsely LED
[1:48:03] amen isn't that beautiful it just makes
[1:48:05] it makes it cut and dried and many
[1:48:08] people when they have different views on
[1:48:10] it that it can make them really upset
[1:48:13] but we're not here to make people upset
[1:48:14] we're just here to encourage people to
[1:48:16] get to Christ and the true baptism of
[1:48:18] the Holy Spirit and the only way we're
[1:48:20] going to see the true baptism of the
[1:48:21] holy spirit is to come acord according
[1:48:23] to the word exactly according to the
[1:48:25] word not a traditional teaching maybe
[1:48:28] stand with me as we
[1:48:30] close brother Bram says to begin with
[1:48:33] you'll notice that in my meetings when I
[1:48:35] have finished preaching an evangelic
[1:48:38] service or some teaching message I cast
[1:48:41] the net and invite a response from the
[1:48:43] people I ask them to come forward and
[1:48:45] receive the Holy Spirit my Pentecostal
[1:48:48] friends upon hearing me say this believe
[1:48:50] that I am inviting people to come come
[1:48:53] forward to be baptized with the Holy
[1:48:55] Ghost because they are already born
[1:48:58] again so when I invite those who are
[1:49:00] spirit filled to come and deal with
[1:49:02] those who have answered the invitation
[1:49:05] to receive the spirit these dear ones
[1:49:07] surge forward and deal with the people
[1:49:09] in such manner as to encourage them to
[1:49:12] yield to God and to believe to speak in
[1:49:15] tongues this is caused a great deal of
[1:49:18] confusion and I want to tell you exactly
[1:49:20] what I mean I mean for The Sinner to
[1:49:22] come come forward and be born
[1:49:25] again which is to be baptized into the
[1:49:28] body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which
[1:49:31] is exactly what took place at Pentecost
[1:49:34] when the church was
[1:49:36] launched I think this is so critical
[1:49:38] brothers and sisters in other words to
[1:49:40] be born of the spirit is to be truly
[1:49:43] baptized with the Holy
[1:49:46] Ghost it is one and the
[1:49:50] same many times it can be split up
[1:49:52] because of different teachings we can
[1:49:54] have all manner of teachings mixed in
[1:49:56] with the message of the hour Traditions
[1:49:58] Methodist
[1:49:59] Presbyterian Catholic
[1:50:02] Pentecostal all manner of traditions can
[1:50:05] slip in and make it seem like it's
[1:50:06] something else brothers and sisters it's
[1:50:08] one in the same that's why brother Barry
[1:50:10] keeps saying get the Holy Ghost brothers
[1:50:12] and sisters know that you know that you
[1:50:14] know you got the Holy Ghost because if
[1:50:16] you got the Holy Ghost you got the
[1:50:17] inside teacher if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:50:19] the inside teacher then you're born
[1:50:21] again

[1:50:26] prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[1:50:28] thank you for your word thank you for
[1:50:31] your word of encouragement Lord yes Lord
[1:50:34] father you know our hearts we don't
[1:50:36] worship a man we worship
[1:50:38] you we know that man chose to tell you
[1:50:43] one time don't speak L we die but speak
[1:50:47] to us through the
[1:50:49] prophet so you said okay that's what
[1:50:52] will do and you you you change not your
[1:50:55] Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same
[1:50:57] yesterday today and forever why would
[1:50:59] you ever change your program you haven't
[1:51:01] done that and we thank you for that Lord
[1:51:04] this world changes we change but you
[1:51:07] never change and father tonight I pray
[1:51:10] that you would just help each one of us
[1:51:12] Lord Jesus to just align ourselves with
[1:51:15] this unchanging word with your
[1:51:17] unchanging ways with your unchanging
[1:51:21] sacrifice Lord to know what you've done
[1:51:23] for us Lord it truly is humbling it
[1:51:26] truly causes something to stir inside
[1:51:29] our very souls to just want to worship
[1:51:32] you to give you praise and glory father
[1:51:35] to go and find that last predestinated
[1:51:37] seed to sigh and cry for the
[1:51:39] Abominations in the land it's not just
[1:51:41] enough to say Amen to the word but Lord
[1:51:44] to look around at this world oh Father
[1:51:46] it's falling apart all around us and
[1:51:49] we're so thankful that you said that
[1:51:52] Lord you would stop time you would
[1:51:55] shorten the days father so that flesh
[1:51:59] could be
[1:52:00] saved and we know that just any day now
[1:52:02] you're going to take your bride out of
[1:52:04] here and we just pray that we could
[1:52:06] align ourselves with your word with your
[1:52:08] truth father that we could Lord Jesus
[1:52:10] consecrate ourselves fresh every single
[1:52:12] day be looking and wondering is today
[1:52:15] the day because one of these days it
[1:52:17] will happen and we thank you for that
[1:52:20] promise Lord we just want to commit each
[1:52:23] life into your hands now as we go our
[1:52:24] separate ways help us to consider the
[1:52:26] words that were spoken tonight father
[1:52:29] you would not have us ignorant
[1:52:31] concerning these things and we thank you
[1:52:33] for that
