[6:58] Amen. God bless each one of you once
[7:00] again this evening of each one out. God
[7:03] bless you richly. Hopefully uh today's
[7:05] been an interesting day for me, maybe
[7:07] for some of you as well. But I'm just
[7:09] thanking the Lord again for Wednesday
[7:10] night just to reset just to get together
[7:14] and be in the in the presence of the
[7:16] Lord in a in a unique way. Not that we
[7:18] can't be individually but together.

[23:46] [Music]
[23:48] from this city.
[24:00] I raise
[24:04] [Music]
[24:07] you to my fing
[24:10] [Music]
[24:18] [Applause]
[24:20] [Music]
[24:23] for me.
[24:25] Oh, may my life today
[24:34] change
[24:37] and
[24:39] make
[24:41] fire.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; That's all the singing will do. Thank
[24:47] you very much.
[24:49] Um,
[24:52] yes, we have a couple of prayer requests
[24:54] here.
[24:55] Um
[24:58] there's a prayer request for sister Ne.
[25:01] Um
[25:03] she's not feeling well, low energy,
[25:05] difficulty breathing.
[25:09] Let's see the Lord's intervention for
[25:10] her.
[25:12] And then there is another prayer request
[25:15] from sister Judith, brother Steven for
[25:18] traveling mercies going to Arizona.
[25:23] so that the Lord will lead them and
[25:25] bring them home safely.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Now, if you have a request, please let's
[25:31] make it known with an uplifted hand as
[25:33] we go before him.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Our dear Lord and King, you mean
[25:37] everything to us.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Father, every time we come before you,
[25:42] we know we in the presence of the king
[25:45] &gt;&gt; and we know, Father, that all our
[25:49] worries
[25:50] &gt;&gt; are gone. And that is our faith. That is
[25:53] what we believe.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; And that is why, Father, we keep coming
[25:58] for more testimonies. Lord, we are
[26:01] gathered here this evening, Father, to
[26:02] worship you. We are gathered to praise
[26:05] you. We are gathered to enjoy that
[26:07] privilege that is uniquely ours. We have
[26:10] gathered to use that name that is given
[26:12] exclusively to humanity. Father, we
[26:15] pray, oh Lord, that you not leave us,
[26:18] that you not forsake us, oh Lord. Father
[26:20] that you be pleased with our gathering
[26:22] oh Lord and Father that you will come
[26:24] among us oh Lord that you share of
[26:26] yourself of your very life with your
[26:28] children oh Lord that you have
[26:30] permanence in every aspect of your
[26:32] service oh Lord oh precious Lord we pray
[26:35] that you bless the way that is going
[26:37] forth oh Lord that you bless the people
[26:39] that are guided here listening oh Lord
[26:41] that you bless the vessel that you've
[26:43] chosen to use oh Lord that you take
[26:45] preminence over everything oh Lord
[26:48] &gt;&gt; oh Lord have your way. Father,
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Father, I remember our sister Dave who
[26:54] is at home. Father, we pray that your
[26:56] presence will be with her, oh Lord,
[26:58] &gt;&gt; that you confirm to her again that you
[27:00] are that prayer answering God, that you
[27:02] are that healer, that you are that one
[27:05] true and living God who has visited his
[27:07] children once more in the same time. Oh
[27:09] Lord, touch her, oh Lord, and give her a
[27:12] testimony, Father. We pray merciful
[27:14] father that you be with us sister Judith
[27:17] that you be with our brother Steven as
[27:19] they travel father let your presence go
[27:22] with them may you prosper their way oh
[27:24] lord and let them return with a
[27:26] testimony oh lord praising your name
[27:28] father we pray father that all the hands
[27:31] that are lifted up father you know the
[27:34] needs that are behind those arms father
[27:38] &gt;&gt; lord may you answer it oh lord that it
[27:41] will be made manifest that Every time we
[27:43] come before you, we receive an answer.
[27:45] Oh Lord, make us sensitive to your
[27:47] direction, oh Lord, that we'll know what
[27:49] you're doing this evening. Father, even
[27:51] as your word goes forth, we pray that
[27:53] you'll bless it all to the hearts of
[27:55] your children, oh Lord. Lord,
[27:57] &gt;&gt; help me, Lord. Don't let my weakness
[28:00] limit you, Lord.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let my shortfall limit you, oh
[28:04] Lord.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; All that matters here is that we do what
[28:07] is your purpose and what pleases you.
[28:10] And so I surrender, oh Lord, to your
[28:11] call. Have your way for your glory in
[28:14] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; So whilst you're standing, we'll turn to
[28:20] first Peter.
[28:23] Sorry to have kept you standing for a
[28:25] little bit.
[28:30] Going to read from first Peter chapter
[28:32] 1.
[28:47] Sorry. Sorry. Forgive me. Let's turn to
[28:49] second Peter chapter one.
[28:55] Second Peter chapter 1 and um
[29:00] I'll be reading from verse 10.
[29:10] Second Peter chapter 1:10.
[29:13] Wherefore the rather brethren, give
[29:16] diligence to make your calling and
[29:18] election sure. For if ye do these
[29:21] things, ye shall never fail.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; For so an entrance shall be ministered
[29:27] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[29:29] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[29:31] Christ. Amen.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[29:36] you always in remembrance of these
[29:38] things, though ye know them, and be
[29:41] established in the present truth. Yay. I
[29:44] think it meets as long as I am in this
[29:47] tabernacle to stir you up by putting you
[29:52] in remembrance.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Knowing that shortly I must put off this
[29:56] my tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus
[29:58] Christ has shown me. Moreover, I will
[30:01] endeavor that ye may be able after my
[30:04] disease to have these things always in
[30:07] remembrance.
[30:10] For we have not followed cunningly
[30:12] devised fables
[30:14] when we made known unto you the power
[30:18] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; But we're eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; I think I'll stop here. May the Lord add
[30:27] his blessings to the reading of his
[30:29] word. You may be seated.
[30:36] So um
[30:39] this evening will be a bit of uh
[30:43] I'm not sure how to call it but just
[30:45] going over a few um quotes some of which
[30:49] I've shared here right here before
[30:52] but I I witnessed an event
[30:57] within this p these past two years in
[31:00] sorry these past two weeks in an
[31:03] environment that to me uh I've always
[31:07] known to be like it is it's an
[31:09] environment where people actually uh
[31:12] believe this message of the hour
[31:15] and the more I watched these events
[31:20] the more I I got convinced that
[31:25] if
[31:27] for any reason at all
[31:30] we sideline this message
[31:33] If we replace it a little bit with the
[31:36] thoughts of that inspiring ministry,
[31:39] that that great preacher, that wonderful
[31:42] brother,
[31:43] the revelations of this group and that
[31:46] person,
[31:48] everything will come down to just a
[31:50] lodge.
[31:53] We will just be a group of people
[31:55] gathering together to feel good about
[31:57] ourselves.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe help one another. Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; The moment this message loses its
[32:03] position,
[32:05] &gt;&gt; in the hearts of the believer first, but
[32:08] in the midst of the congregation too,
[32:11] &gt;&gt; that is it.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, we can say still make the claim we
[32:15] are message believers. Yes, we are the
[32:17] bride. Yes, we are going to the rapture.
[32:19] We can say all of that. After all, we're
[32:22] in Laia, right? This is where we make
[32:25] the claims. This I sit as a queen and
[32:29] I'm no widow and have need of nothing
[32:32] when we actually blind, miserable,
[32:34] wretched, naked and not even know it.
[32:36] And so this is a time of claim.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Let's be watchful. Let's ignore the
[32:42] claim and cling to the substance.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; And so um for those of you who have been
[32:51] around for a while, this may be like
[32:54] preaching to the choir. Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; But I I really felt pressed that this is
[32:59] what I have to do. So I'm going to share
[33:01] a few quotes, quite a few. And I want to
[33:06] title it the present truth.
[33:10] The present truth.
[33:12] Now the scripture we read speaks about
[33:15] it says
[33:17] give diligence to make your calling and
[33:20] election sh.
[33:22] So it doesn't just say make your calling
[33:24] and lection sh it says give diligence
[33:28] meaning pay attention
[33:30] be careful be serious stay focused
[33:34] hallelujah
[33:36] &gt;&gt; and we will see why that is important
[33:40] but in doing so he says we shall never
[33:44] fall
[33:46] it means if we are not careful if we are
[33:49] not focused if we don't give attention
[33:52] we shall fall.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; So let's take it this way. But then if
[33:57] we are if we are very careful then he
[33:59] continues to says an entrance shall be
[34:02] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[34:05] everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus
[34:07] Christ. Now of course we all know that
[34:11] the kingdom of the Lord is the Holy
[34:13] Spirit.
[34:15] But then
[34:17] when he says it shall have an
[34:18] everlasting kingdom
[34:21] that that means not just an influence of
[34:24] the Holy Spirit not just an indwelling
[34:28] but a sealing.
[34:30] It means that it is done for good. That
[34:33] is the only way it can be everlasting.
[34:35] Now you know Barraham says you can be
[34:37] filled with the Holy Ghost every day of
[34:38] your life and still end up in hell
[34:40] because the anointing is on the flesh.
[34:42] Right? But now for it here is saying
[34:46] that
[34:47] when you are seeking to make your uh
[34:50] calling and election sure
[34:54] an entrance shall be ministered unto you
[34:57] so that we can have this everlasting
[35:02] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[35:04] Christ. Then he says I will not be
[35:07] negligent.
[35:08] Now look at it this way that the man is
[35:11] saying that even failing to tell you is
[35:14] negligence.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Failing to tell. Now it's not as if he's
[35:19] bringing a new information. It's not as
[35:22] if he's bringing a new message,
[35:24] something unheard of. No, it's the same
[35:26] old thing. If you watch it says it's
[35:29] something that they are established in
[35:32] it. It says you know it and you are
[35:35] established in it and still coming to
[35:39] remind you if he fails to do it he's
[35:42] been negligent.
[35:44] I want to believe that that's what I'm
[35:45] going to do this evening that you don't
[35:48] feel that I'm I'm bringing those same
[35:50] things but the thought is important and
[35:54] and for us to understand why if for the
[35:58] whole of this this uh second epistle of
[36:01] Peter was actually written and he uses
[36:04] the word to stir up our me uh faith by
[36:07] way of remembrance.
[36:12] Why? because he says there will be some
[36:14] gone out scoffers
[36:17] who will come among us. So he the idea
[36:19] is that he says he wants us to remember
[36:21] the things that the prophets have told
[36:23] us and then remember the things that the
[36:25] apostles have told us.
[36:28] So it's very important. That's why it
[36:30] says give diligence. But the way to do
[36:33] it is to be reminding yourself
[36:37] constantly about these things. And to
[36:39] remember what he's telling them, they
[36:42] established in it and to know it. He
[36:44] said, I
[36:46] think it meet as long as I am in this
[36:49] tabernacle.
[36:51] Imagine a man who has been shown by the
[36:53] Lord Jesus Christ that he's going to die
[36:56] very soon. Do you have that linker here?
[37:04] No, I don't think that's it.
[37:08] A man who has been shown by the Lord
[37:10] Jesus Christ that he's going to pass
[37:13] away very soon.
[37:16] And then he's talking to his loved ones.
[37:19] He's addressing the people that he
[37:23] loves. That's it.
[37:26] Okay, thank you. He's addressing the
[37:29] people that he loves.
[37:31] Now, in our normal lives, you know, when
[37:34] somebody is going to pass away,
[37:37] you are thinking of, you know,
[37:40] the the the title to that property,
[37:43] maybe the house, maybe the car, maybe
[37:47] the bank account,
[37:49] something precious, something important.
[37:52] Now, this man Peter is about to pass
[37:54] away. And the most important and the
[37:57] treasure that he wants to pass along is
[37:59] to remind them constantly.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; So just know that he understands the
[38:05] times in which they were living and he
[38:08] knows the importance of what they have
[38:09] heard. And yes, they've heard it to the
[38:12] extent that they established in it. But
[38:14] they could slip away easily.
[38:17] They could listen even the word of God
[38:20] the word of God that created heaven and
[38:22] earth
[38:24] it could be established in you and by
[38:27] men's tradition you can make it of non
[38:29] effect
[38:31] and so don't underestimate the need to
[38:34] focus on the word of God day in and day
[38:37] out constantly reading constantly
[38:39] meditating
[38:41] because that's what makes us who we are
[38:43] that is our identity that is our Paul
[38:46] that is our purpose in life. Praise the
[38:49] name of the Lord.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And so Peter is about to pass away
[38:56] and his purpose is to con start
[38:59] reminding them and then continue
[39:02] reminding them. And then he says that
[39:05] even after my disease,
[39:07] he says in 15 says, "Moreover, I will
[39:10] endeavor that ye may be able after my
[39:12] disease to have these things always in
[39:15] remembrance." That is why we have it
[39:17] written now. So that we will have it
[39:20] always in remembrance.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine how vital this is?
[39:25] Praise the name of the Lord. And then it
[39:27] comes to that part that I love. Uh I I
[39:30] was watching some something about it and
[39:33] said we have not followed cunningly
[39:37] devised fables.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; So we have not followed the story of
[39:41] some smart guy.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; No, not some eloquent guy told the
[39:47] stories and we believed it. No.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; No. But we were eyewitnesses.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; This is the powerful part of it.
[39:55] Eyewitnesses.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; They have the testimony.
[40:00] And that is the most important thing and
[40:01] the most difficult thing for people who
[40:03] oppose the the gospel
[40:05] because when they come they have to be
[40:08] able to disprove the resurrection.
[40:11] But as far as normal human life now you
[40:14] can talk of logic, psychology, whatever.
[40:17] But for the normal human life, it's
[40:19] impossible to disprove the the the
[40:21] resurrection because the records are not
[40:24] just in Bible. They're in secular
[40:26] literature, secular history. But above
[40:28] that, the people claiming to be
[40:30] witnesses and this is what I what got
[40:32] me. I never heard of that before. That
[40:36] the people followed the Lord Jesus
[40:38] Christ.
[40:40] If there is a gain in whatever they are
[40:42] doing, they could tell a lie.
[40:46] But now when the Lord Jesus Christ has
[40:49] been crucified, actually treated like a
[40:52] criminal and killed and gone, who are
[40:55] they seeking to please when they
[40:56] continue to hold on that they are
[40:58] eyewitnesses of the resurrection?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; But it goes on more.
[41:04] When they catch you, not so like the
[41:07] apostles, but even some of the
[41:09] disciples, they catch you, they're going
[41:10] to kill you.
[41:12] If what you believe is a lie and they
[41:14] said recant and we'll spare your life.
[41:17] Won't you recant? Who will say I'm
[41:19] defending the lie with my life? How does
[41:22] that happen? What is the gain? So in the
[41:25] normal course of human life, the proof
[41:28] of the resurrection can never be denied.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Brother, we can say just like Peter, we
[41:35] have not believed cunningly devised
[41:36] fables.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And so I want us to go on and look at
[41:45] this present truth.
[41:48] What is the present truth?
[41:51] Now um
[41:54] we know the Bible is there the word of
[41:57] God
[41:58] and is a God's word of truth. Right?
[42:02] Now,
[42:04] all right.
[42:05] In the second coming, brother Ram says,
[42:09] "The Bible is God's infallible,
[42:13] eternal, everpresent word."
[42:17] And frankly, it's God himself in there
[42:21] living in word form.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:26] And so we start by understanding that
[42:28] the Bible is the very basis of every
[42:31] truth.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Now the truth that we are talking of in
[42:37] this h this evening you will accept and
[42:40] understand that it's not the opposite of
[42:42] lies.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; The truth that we are talking of is not
[42:46] an ideology.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; It's not some doctrine or philosophy.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; No. Because none of these can minister,
[42:56] praise the name of the Lord.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; An entrance
[43:00] into the everlasting kingdom of the Lord
[43:02] Jesus Christ.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Theories have come, theories have gone,
[43:05] they have been good, they have been bad,
[43:07] they've met situations fine, but none
[43:10] ministers an entrance
[43:13] into the everlasting kingdom of the Lord
[43:15] Jesus Christ. And so, where do I go from
[43:18] here? The truth is a man. The truth is
[43:23] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the only person who
[43:31] stood and said, "I'm the way, the truth,
[43:33] and the life."
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no one beside him.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now the question is,
[43:41] if that is so, why the present truth?
[43:46] Why is there a present truth and a past
[43:48] truth and a future truth? Shouldn't
[43:50] truth be objective? Shouldn't truth be
[43:53] once and the same?
[43:56] &gt;&gt; And that is true.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; So in a sense that it's worth asking why
[44:01] the present truth and the reason is that
[44:04] the truth is once it's just one is the
[44:08] man the Lord the person of the Lord
[44:10] Jesus Christ. But you see, where we find
[44:12] oursself in history is what determines
[44:16] what we see of the present truth.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Where we find ourselves in history
[44:22] determines
[44:24] how it is revealed to us.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Like as I was I'm standing here right
[44:28] now, you see a very different part of
[44:30] the pulpit from what I see. And I'm glad
[44:34] you see this way. You don't see me
[44:35] shaking or any wobbly, right? So it
[44:38] helps. Now if I should stand here
[44:41] there's a part of the public that I see
[44:43] and it will be different from if I'm
[44:45] standing this way and it will be
[44:47] different from if I'm standing this way
[44:49] and this is what I'm saying that
[44:50] depending on where you're standing in
[44:52] history that determines
[44:56] what you see of the truth
[44:58] &gt;&gt; but it's the same Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:02] There was a time, there was a season
[45:06] when God's wrath was coming on earth.
[45:09] A man received the word of God. It now
[45:14] for those who say, "Oh yeah, and how
[45:15] come you think you alone have the
[45:17] truth?" Noah alone had the truth.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Noah alone had the truth.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And
[45:26] so he received the truth. He believed
[45:29] the truth. But because it was the truth
[45:31] of the hour, it quickened him into
[45:33] action.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Now he received the word, believe it and
[45:37] the action was the product of the word.
[45:39] What is it? The word made flesh.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; So the act was Jesus Christ again in
[45:45] flesh.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; What happened? You get in, not a drop of
[45:49] the flood will touch you.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is how it was and
[45:54] that is how it has always been. Another
[45:57] instant, the wrath of God is coming.
[45:59] People he listen to their prophet and
[46:02] they slaughter a lamp. What was it? The
[46:05] Lord Jesus Christ again. And then they
[46:07] put the the the blood on the lent. And
[46:11] so once they are under it, it doesn't
[46:13] matter whether they kill somebody
[46:15] yesterday. They are safe.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't matter. Oh, you
[46:20] are not from this family. It doesn't
[46:21] matter. I am in the blood.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; I am under the talking. Praise the name
[46:25] of the living God.
[46:28] And so all every time, every season,
[46:30] everywhere, God has manifested himself
[46:33] in a way. And when people hear it and
[46:36] they believe it and they live it, it
[46:38] produces Jesus Christ again.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And so this is where I want us to start
[46:46] talking about this. Now referring to the
[46:50] Bible in the message Joseph meeting his
[46:52] brothers, brother Ram says that it is
[46:55] given to the human race and for all
[46:58] times and for all ages because it is a
[47:01] written word of God.
[47:04] Hallelujah.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; So it's for all times and for all ages.
[47:08] That is the Bible.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; But now not all of the Bible is the word
[47:14] for today.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[47:18] I have a daughter. I can shut her in the
[47:21] room and repeat thousand to thousand
[47:24] times to her. A virgin shall conceive. A
[47:26] virgin shall conceive a thousand times
[47:28] every day. For the rest of her life,
[47:29] she's not going to conceive.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; But it's still the word of the Lord.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Understand it. It has already been
[47:35] lived.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; And so all of the Bible is all of the
[47:41] word of God for all the time, but not
[47:43] all of the Bible is the word of God for
[47:46] today. And so the allotted word for your
[47:49] day
[47:50] &gt;&gt; when it is quickened to you
[47:52] &gt;&gt; and you live it that is the present
[47:55] truth.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And so this is what we are stepping we
[48:00] are setting off to to to um talk about
[48:05] that. Oh you can take Noah's word you
[48:08] can go and build an ark for Moses. It'll
[48:11] be the word of God but it won't save the
[48:14] people.
[48:15] Praise the name of the Lord because that
[48:17] was not the word for that time.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That was not the word for that season.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:24] Now, Brother Abraham tells us in
[48:26] convinced and then concerned 196 says,
[48:28] I'm convinced in the ministry and the
[48:31] message I'm preaching. I'm convinced
[48:33] that it's the truth.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that these visions come
[48:37] from God.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced we are living in the last
[48:40] days. I'm convinced that in this I'm
[48:44] convinced that this very spirit that is
[48:45] on me now is the Holy Ghost.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Glory. I'm thoroughly convinced. I'm
[48:52] convinced that the Holy Ghost way is
[48:54] right.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that the Bible is the
[48:57] truth.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And so that is it. The Bible is the
[49:04] truth. And then he says the message is
[49:06] the truth.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Where is the link? one explains the
[49:10] other. One is a part of the Bible that
[49:13] is quickened for us today.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I understand that we live in a
[49:20] time, we live in a season where this
[49:23] word of God, this revealed word of the
[49:26] Lord,
[49:27] especially sent to this special woman,
[49:30] this bride has been attacked,
[49:33] continuously attacked, has been
[49:36] misrepresented.
[49:37] the the the the the messenger has been
[49:39] attacked and it's gone on so much so if
[49:43] the Lord does not prove it to you, if he
[49:46] does not reveal it to you and I
[49:48] personally in our hearts,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; we we will also walk away
[49:52] &gt;&gt; the same way many people have walked
[49:54] away.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; But you see,
[49:59] Abraham tells us that God interprets his
[50:01] own word. Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; So it's not subject to another eloquent
[50:05] man's interpretation.
[50:07] No, God fulfills and confirms his word
[50:10] in the heart of his children. Praise the
[50:13] name of the living God.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; And so this is it. Some will say, "Well,
[50:19] I don't need to go. I I'll just stay,
[50:21] but you know,
[50:23] I can read. I have the Holy Spirit. So
[50:27] maybe I can look and see which one." So
[50:29] then they start picking and choosing.
[50:33] And when they meet you and you say you
[50:36] believe all the word, you believe
[50:37] everything the prophet preached, then
[50:40] they start labeling you.
[50:42] Maybe you are blind,
[50:44] maybe you are cult.
[50:47] Maybe you follow a man.
[50:52] Last time I checked, every single
[50:56] time that God manifested himself in the
[50:59] life of a man, that man had the
[51:02] following.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; People followed Noah into the ark.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; People followed
[51:12] Moses out of Egypt.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; People followed Joshua into the promised
[51:17] land. And we can keep going, right? When
[51:20] God calls a people, Jesus when he was on
[51:22] earth, he had followers.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had followers.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And
[51:32] so then they start calling you names.
[51:34] And what they're doing is trying to
[51:36] waken and discourage people from
[51:40] believing the present truth. And why do
[51:43] I say that? Because it's the only answer
[51:45] to all what the devil is doing in this
[51:47] end time.
[51:49] not just an answer, it's the only
[51:51] answer. Praise the name of the Lord.
[51:55] And then my favorite one is, oh well,
[51:59] you can, it doesn't matter as long as
[52:00] the person is preaching the Bible,
[52:04] right? As long as he's preaching the
[52:06] Bible,
[52:09] there is more to it than just preaching
[52:10] the Bible.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; People have preached the Bible. with
[52:18] good intentions.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; But they have ended up in denominations.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; We have so I don't know no hundreds or
[52:26] thousands of denominations precisely
[52:28] because people with good intentions
[52:31] ignored God's provided explanation. They
[52:34] ignore God's provided way for their age
[52:38] and went on their own. And what we have
[52:41] are all these denominations.
[52:44] So somebody comes and says, "No, you
[52:46] have to say Hail Mary." The other one
[52:48] says, "No, you have to worship on the
[52:50] Sabbath."
[52:52] This one says, "No, you don't have to
[52:54] beat any drum in the church."
[52:59] I can keep going on, but you know them.
[53:01] Hallelujah. And so it's something very
[53:04] important that look if somebody writes a
[53:08] poem
[53:10] I believe that he understands it better
[53:12] than all the people on earth. And if
[53:16] somebody writes this book and brings it
[53:19] to us I believe he can explain it better
[53:22] than anybody else.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And so when he brings you the
[53:25] explanation
[53:26] you thank the Lord and continue in it.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:31] Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:36] So when you say, "Oh yeah, as long as
[53:37] they're preaching the Bible," it sounds
[53:39] pious.
[53:41] It sounds even serious.
[53:45] But you just have to understand that
[53:47] there are distinction. There are
[53:49] differences in people and there are
[53:51] differences in the messages that come.
[53:53] Hallelujah.
[53:55] So there's a there has to be a
[53:57] difference between one who believes the
[53:58] message because he has heard from a man
[54:03] like right now yeah there are all of us
[54:05] are here we are talking but when we
[54:08] finish I'm going home with one person
[54:10] only one lady and nobody else no matter
[54:14] how nice I speak to any sister here that
[54:17] is fine it's for here it's done but what
[54:20] is between myself and that lady is it
[54:23] stands out it's
[54:25] And God is doing the same right now. He
[54:28] has chosen a lady and he has come to her
[54:31] and spoken to her just like he sent
[54:34] Eleaza
[54:36] to uh Rebecca. Ela spoke to Rebecca
[54:41] directly. The the other attendants did
[54:44] not hear what was said. Yes, they
[54:46] followed through. Glory to God. They
[54:48] were blessed. And they were way more
[54:50] than Rebecca. Rebecca was just one
[54:51] person.
[54:53] But still the word of God had gone forth
[54:57] to Rebecca. So Rebecca was walking as a
[55:00] possessor of a promise. The others were
[55:02] going but they didn't have that promise.
[55:05] But Rebecca did. What if Rebecca had
[55:08] triv trivialized that? Oh yeah, it's
[55:11] just something you told me. That's it.
[55:14] So let's understand it. It's important
[55:17] that we know and understand what we have
[55:20] received.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] Now you will realize that when the word
[55:27] was made fleshed here on earth in its
[55:31] fullness,
[55:32] it did not stop the Pharisees from going
[55:36] to the Lord with the written word.
[55:39] The Bible says this. The Bible says that
[55:41] why do you do this? Why do your
[55:43] disciples do that? It did not s stop the
[55:46] Sadducees from going to do that. But the
[55:50] difference was that they had the written
[55:51] word
[55:53] &gt;&gt; but the Lord Jesus Christ was the
[55:54] revealed word made flesh
[55:57] &gt;&gt; and so they were no match for him.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Where is the revealed word today?
[56:04] Where is the word made flesh today? When
[56:07] the scripture says as it was in the days
[56:09] of Noah
[56:10] as it was in the days of Lord when it
[56:13] says in the name in the in the days of
[56:15] the voice of the seventh angel when it
[56:17] shall begin to sound. Who is he sing to
[56:20] when he says they that for they that
[56:22] fear my name the son of righteousness
[56:24] shall rise?
[56:27] Who are these people who fear his name?
[56:30] When he says I will send you Elijah the
[56:32] prophet. Who is you?
[56:36] Where is the revealed word today? Is it
[56:39] not in you and I?
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Now will that stop the devil from coming
[56:43] to you with the written word?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And
[56:48] how do we stand against it? How do we
[56:51] answer unless we are immersed in the
[56:53] revealed word?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And so this is where I'm going with
[56:59] this. Praise the name of the Lord.
[57:08] in God identified by his
[57:10] characteristics. Brother Abraham says,
[57:12] "Now watch, now watch that 12 year old
[57:15] boy being the word for that hour. He was
[57:19] the promised word for the hour, the
[57:23] anointed Messiah."
[57:26] Now when you reach such places, people
[57:29] begin to shake and think, where are you
[57:32] going with this?
[57:34] Hallelujah.
[57:35] If the promised word for that hour was
[57:39] the anointed Messiah, what will the
[57:42] promised word for this hour be?
[57:46] Hallelujah.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And yet the devil went to him. The devil
[57:51] tempted him and his people also tempted
[57:54] him. Now this is what I'm saying that
[57:58] for us to stand
[58:00] &gt;&gt; because we have a position. Oh, we
[58:02] believe the Bible. Yes. But for us to
[58:04] stand firm, we need to be in the
[58:07] revealed word and we need to be firmly
[58:10] immersed. Praise the name of the Lord.
[58:12] Otherwise, how do we stand? We do. So,
[58:15] we have to get to the point where
[58:19] we say, "No matter what, this is our
[58:22] life. No matter what, this is our
[58:24] choice." We have to get a point like
[58:26] Peter said, "To whom shall we go to? You
[58:30] alone have the words of eternal life.
[58:33] You alone.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Not you and other people. Not yours is
[58:38] eternal life, but ours is also good. No,
[58:41] you alone.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; That is where we have to get to.
[58:45] Hallelujah. And until we get there,
[58:49] the devil can come to us.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And he's not going to announce, "Hey,
[58:52] look at me. I'm the devil." No. He's
[58:55] coming to you more sounding and seeming
[58:58] more spiritual than you and I are. and
[59:01] he's coming with the scripture. Now,
[59:04] where what will be your stand? Praise
[59:06] the name of the Lord. Now, um I the
[59:10] times past when I I share these um
[59:13] quotes,
[59:15] I spoke of um a a very
[59:20] interesting uh experiment that uh Jacob
[59:24] Dor did. Now, this Jacob Defor is an
[59:29] actor, but he's also a movie producer,
[59:33] and he's looking to um
[59:37] he's looking to sort of advertise
[59:40] his work. And so, he finds a Christian
[59:44] uh platform online
[59:47] and he sees thousands of Christians and
[59:50] people are writing, "Hallelujah. Glory
[59:52] to God. Praise God. He's a living. God
[59:54] is true. God is good." all the time and
[59:57] he's excited and this is going on and
[1:00:00] he's thinking is this all true? Okay,
[1:00:03] let's see what happens. And so he writes
[1:00:08] Luke 4:7.
[1:00:10] If you believe say amen
[1:00:13] and then he starts getting amen, glory
[1:00:16] to God, praise God, hallelujah, God is
[1:00:18] good. And on and on. He see somebody
[1:00:21] whose name is pastor something. He also
[1:00:24] responds and he says, "Are you a
[1:00:26] pastor?" The guy says, "Yes."
[1:00:29] He says, "Do you realize who he's
[1:00:30] talking?" Say, "Yes, our Lord Jesus
[1:00:32] Christ."
[1:00:40] I don't think I have it here. Luke 4:7.
[1:00:43] Yes.
[1:00:45] If thou therefore will worship me, all
[1:00:48] shall be dying.
[1:00:50] That is the devil speaking.
[1:00:53] And this is where I'm coming in that the
[1:00:56] man quoted the Bible, but he was quoting
[1:00:58] the devil.
[1:01:01] Is it enough to say, "Oh, yeah. As long
[1:01:03] as you're preaching the Bible,"
[1:01:05] the people said amen to the Bible, but
[1:01:08] they were saying amen to the words of
[1:01:10] the devil.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he said 96% of the
[1:01:15] people said amen to it. He said only 3%
[1:01:19] realized, "No, this is the devil.
[1:01:23] And so what am I saying? That the word
[1:01:25] for us that is brought to us,
[1:01:28] if we really know what it means, if we
[1:01:32] really know how much we need it, if we
[1:01:35] really understand how much we should
[1:01:36] depend on it, we will be devouring it
[1:01:39] left and right,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; we will be we wouldn't be waiting for
[1:01:42] somebody to tell us about it. Especially
[1:01:47] if you're a parent and you're a father,
[1:01:50] you're supposed to be the gatekeeper of
[1:01:52] your house. If you're a pastor, you're
[1:01:55] supposed to be the gatekeeper of the
[1:01:56] congregation.
[1:01:59] But every single one of us, if we really
[1:02:01] know what it means, we won't wait for
[1:02:03] somebody to tell us.
[1:02:07] Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:02:12] Is it enough that we're preaching the
[1:02:13] Bible?
[1:02:17] Some of the greatest opposition brother
[1:02:18] Abraham received on earth were from
[1:02:21] ministers
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; and church leaders.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Some of us a picture some of us have a
[1:02:30] picture of brother Abraham with a halo
[1:02:32] over his head. How did that come by?
[1:02:36] A very well-arned minister Dr. best
[1:02:39] stood against him. That is how the Lord
[1:02:42] permitted that picture to be taken.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; So is it enough that we are quoting the
[1:02:48] Bible? So we are right.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:56] Now there was a time when a man received
[1:02:59] the word
[1:03:02] Paul.
[1:03:03] He was Saul.
[1:03:05] He graduated from a prestigious college
[1:03:09] and the gamal.
[1:03:12] But when he got the written word without
[1:03:14] the revealed word, what did that do to
[1:03:16] him? He persecuted the Christians. He
[1:03:19] persecuted the very Lord he thought he
[1:03:22] was worshiping. He persecuted the one he
[1:03:24] thought he was serving. He was an
[1:03:26] important man.
[1:03:29] Does that matter? No.
[1:03:32] But when he got the revealed word, then
[1:03:35] things began to change.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Then the people he was persecuting, he
[1:03:39] turned around and followed them.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:55] In the message when their eyes
[1:03:58] were opened, they knew him. Brother
[1:04:00] Brian says that they failed to know him
[1:04:03] by the written word.
[1:04:05] Think of that. He was talking about
[1:04:08] Jesus when he come and revealed himself
[1:04:11] by the word to them and they still
[1:04:13] failed to see it. If that ain't a
[1:04:16] picture of today,
[1:04:18] I don't know what is still failing when
[1:04:21] the scriptures say these things.
[1:04:25] Now, I'm going to go a little quick. I'm
[1:04:26] going to skip Abraham calls a few
[1:04:28] scriptures here and it continues and
[1:04:30] still many that love him don't see it.
[1:04:34] They still grope on into darkness. Still
[1:04:38] they fail to know him by the written
[1:04:40] word.
[1:04:42] Brothers and sisters,
[1:04:44] no revelation should contradict the
[1:04:47] Bible.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; But the life of the word is in the
[1:04:52] scripture quickened for this hour.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:04:59] revealed. Rab says the Bible is Christ.
[1:05:02] The Bible is the written word which he
[1:05:05] is the word. Its manifestation is the
[1:05:07] evidence of the life coming into the
[1:05:09] flesh of the word to manifest it.
[1:05:12] Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are in a world today
[1:05:17] where even unbelievers will be happy to
[1:05:20] have some some sort of a shelter, a
[1:05:22] break with all the political turmoil and
[1:05:26] the tensions and the wars. Now people
[1:05:30] don't even talk about natural diseases
[1:05:31] and they're happening everywhere.
[1:05:34] Things are going bad over and over and
[1:05:37] over again. And there is just one escape
[1:05:40] route and that has been provided to us.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; People see the papacy, oh maybe as the
[1:05:49] leaders of of Christianity and what
[1:05:51] they're doing is embracing evil,
[1:05:53] embracing abomination.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Why the Bible calls abomination.
[1:05:59] God has only one answer and that's just
[1:06:01] for you and I. He says he's giving us
[1:06:05] himself. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And that is the present truth. The word
[1:06:11] quickened for today. So that is more
[1:06:14] than a written word. Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] Now in the spoken word is the original
[1:06:26] seed. Brother says I believe the Bible
[1:06:29] is the word the whole truth and Jesus is
[1:06:33] the word made manifest. He and his word
[1:06:36] is one and the same. Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] Now what I say is have you received
[1:06:43] God's answer to this all the problems
[1:06:45] going on and if you have what are you
[1:06:49] doing with it
[1:06:52] praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:55] in revelation of Jesus uh in God's only
[1:06:58] provided place of worship says what is
[1:07:00] he then the word interpreted is the
[1:07:03] manifestation of the name of God I'm
[1:07:07] trying to hurry up quickly Okay.
[1:07:15] And so the simple thing is this.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Without the revelation of the word, we
[1:07:20] can never face the challenges of today.
[1:07:22] Oh yeah, we may face it and we may come
[1:07:25] out in a way that the world approves of
[1:07:27] it. But going scripturally, there's just
[1:07:31] one way and that is what has been
[1:07:33] provided for us. Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] Yeah, we may be inspired and quote
[1:07:39] scriptures and that happens a lot in the
[1:07:41] Bible. We may have zeal like Paul had
[1:07:44] zeal but that zeal led him to persecute
[1:07:46] Christians. You know in the time of um
[1:07:49] Micaiah the the most outstanding story
[1:07:51] of Micaiah all the prophets were quoting
[1:07:53] the Bible.
[1:07:55] Yes. I think in is it first kings or 2
[1:07:58] kings chapter 4 the bible speaks of
[1:08:00] Solomon giving the the the the place to
[1:08:03] to to to Gerba one of the 70 princes. So
[1:08:07] scripturally it was this but the word
[1:08:10] for that day said that God the dogs were
[1:08:14] going to lick the blood of h Jezebel and
[1:08:17] the husband and that was the word to be
[1:08:20] fulfilled then it doesn't know what is
[1:08:23] written already eventually they got it
[1:08:25] is theirs yes
[1:08:27] but for that time and that season there
[1:08:30] was a particular word and when you fail
[1:08:33] it you may coach it all you want like I
[1:08:35] tell you the prophets where inspired
[1:08:39] and they all prophesied wrong and they
[1:08:41] prophesied a lie even though they could
[1:08:44] point it to the scripture. Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] Now
[1:08:52] talking about the mighty works of uh
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ in the sadistician age,
[1:08:57] brother Abraham says that this age does
[1:09:00] not have those works. Oh, they had the
[1:09:02] written word but not the revealed word.
[1:09:07] This was the reformation period.
[1:09:10] But fear not little flock. God said I
[1:09:13] will restore. But I my my emphasis was
[1:09:17] just getting the understanding that
[1:09:18] having the written word is not enough.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And to live it to see it manifest it has
[1:09:25] to be revealed to you.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:09:30] Now,
[1:09:32] I hope I'm not the only one who is
[1:09:34] alarmed
[1:09:37] by all what is going on. We live in a
[1:09:40] country where practically
[1:09:44] uh uh certain uh
[1:09:49] do I say drugs? Well, pot is legal on
[1:09:53] the streets.
[1:09:55] It's something that some years back you
[1:09:57] would be arrested for it.
[1:10:00] Now is sold in shops, legitimate license
[1:10:02] shops.
[1:10:04] Disobedience from kids.
[1:10:07] Pornography in schools. Nobody can stop
[1:10:09] it because they are not carrying papers
[1:10:12] and books. No, it's on simple devices.
[1:10:15] The technology is available.
[1:10:19] The gospel is presented in all forms of
[1:10:21] v unashamedly
[1:10:24] in all forms of variance.
[1:10:27] But you see, yeah, just think of all of
[1:10:31] that and then think of yourself. God
[1:10:33] chose you to live in this age.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He chose you to overcome these
[1:10:38] conditions
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; and he gave you what it takes to
[1:10:40] overcome.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The question is, are we going to take
[1:10:45] what he gave us and add something else
[1:10:48] that we trust will help us or are we
[1:10:51] going to take just what he gave us?
[1:10:54] That is where we have to come to.
[1:10:56] Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Now,
[1:11:00] Brother Ram says in the that the end
[1:11:04] time message, I don't know if I had it.
[1:11:06] Yes. End time evangelism. But Ram says
[1:11:08] end time messenger and message should
[1:11:11] meet end time conditions.
[1:11:13] We are here now. The conditions are here
[1:11:16] now. You know that God has given what it
[1:11:19] takes to overcome them. Are we going to
[1:11:21] take them? Are we going to dilute them?
[1:11:23] Are we going to polish it? Are we going
[1:11:25] to make it better, improve it?
[1:11:29] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And so these are the things that we have
[1:11:32] to sort of understand and deal with that
[1:11:36] what we have received is answer.
[1:11:40] If somebody is sick today,
[1:11:44] they are going to the doctor to get
[1:11:45] well. But seeing the doctor does not
[1:11:48] make you well.
[1:11:50] Oh, the doctor can get a diagnosis. Oh,
[1:11:53] they can give you a prescription. That
[1:11:54] does not make you well. You can fill the
[1:11:57] prescription.
[1:11:59] Sometimes you may even take it and you
[1:12:01] won't be well.
[1:12:04] But here's the difference. If you don't
[1:12:06] take it as prescribed, you are
[1:12:07] underdosing yourself. If you take it
[1:12:10] more than it was prescribed, you are
[1:12:11] overdosing yourself. Both of which are
[1:12:13] dangerous to your health. Yes, sir.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; But if you take it as prescribed, even
[1:12:17] if you are not healed, you make the
[1:12:19] doctor responsible for your health.
[1:12:22] This is where we've gotten to. There is
[1:12:25] a condition. God says these conditions
[1:12:27] are dangerous. Now we know and we see it
[1:12:30] and we live it. And he has given us what
[1:12:33] it takes to overcome them.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; The only thing is are we going to stick
[1:12:38] strictly to it so that God becomes
[1:12:41] responsible for us or are we going to
[1:12:43] say the way we deem fit and appropriate?
[1:12:48] You know, let's do it this way. Maybe
[1:12:50] let's show a little bit of grace here.
[1:12:56] The last time I checked, grace was what
[1:12:58] God has given us to recognize the
[1:13:00] revealed word for the day.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Grace never meant, oh, leave the way you
[1:13:05] are and nobody talks about it and that
[1:13:07] is grace. No.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:22] So God has said in his word that there's
[1:13:24] going to be a bride in this age. He knew
[1:13:27] this age. He knew that there will be a
[1:13:29] people who will fall in love with this
[1:13:32] revealed word and they'll be willing to
[1:13:34] take it as is. They will be willing to
[1:13:38] live it, eat it. They will be willing to
[1:13:41] prophesy again as it has been given to
[1:13:44] us. Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] So the proof of the fact that you are in
[1:13:50] lect is in the fact that you are able to
[1:13:53] recognize the word for your day.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah. It's not how many scriptures
[1:13:58] we can quote, how many scriptures we
[1:14:00] can. No, by the fact that we can
[1:14:02] recognize the word for our day. Praise
[1:14:05] the name of the Lord. Now brother
[1:14:08] Abraham in the spoken word is original
[1:14:09] seed. It says didn't Jesus say of the
[1:14:12] prophets who the word of God came to who
[1:14:15] did the word of God came to prophets.
[1:14:18] Didn't Jesus call them gods? Why God was
[1:14:22] manifest in them? What was it? The
[1:14:26] spoken word manifested.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] So the prophets themselves were the
[1:14:35] manifestation of the spoken word. But
[1:14:37] yet even in Acts 7 stated that the Jews
[1:14:40] had persecuted and murdered the
[1:14:42] prophets.
[1:14:44] So here we are the most religious people
[1:14:47] in some of the most religious places on
[1:14:50] earth and cities
[1:14:53] but they were killing the very people
[1:14:54] that were sent to them.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And they were people of God. They knew
[1:15:00] the written word.
[1:15:02] But they always missed it when it was
[1:15:04] manifested. Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] And when you miss the present truth,
[1:15:12] you may labor, but it'll be in vain.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Now, as we talk about these examples,
[1:15:19] the important thing is for us to
[1:15:21] remember that they are written as an
[1:15:24] example for us so that we don't follow
[1:15:27] the same things. Praise the name of the
[1:15:30] Lord. I wanted to see what brother
[1:15:32] Abraham says about the unpardonable sin.
[1:15:36] He says sin is rejecting the revealed
[1:15:39] will of God. Sin in its initial form is
[1:15:43] to reject the revealed word of God. What
[1:15:47] God or the will of God? When God has
[1:15:49] revealed something as his will and to
[1:15:52] reject it is to blaspheme and to reject
[1:15:55] God.
[1:15:58] Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] And so this is where we are now. I had
[1:16:03] marked here because I thought I some I
[1:16:05] often over talk and then I I I go
[1:16:08] overboard. So I had marked here. But
[1:16:10] right now we have a few a few
[1:16:14] minutes to go.
[1:16:17] Don't worry, I'll finish very soon.
[1:16:20] And so I just want to draw attention to
[1:16:22] something very important.
[1:16:25] And we all know that that the human
[1:16:29] body or or or for life to manifest in
[1:16:33] the natural sense,
[1:16:35] the seed has to come through the body
[1:16:39] into the bride for there to be life.
[1:16:42] Correct?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; The seed has to come through the body.
[1:16:45] It's the same with God. It has not
[1:16:48] changed.
[1:16:50] Now uh I know there are doctrines and
[1:16:54] things and everything but I just want to
[1:16:56] tell you something. There is no other
[1:16:58] way scientific or otherwise for there to
[1:17:00] be life unless the seed comes through
[1:17:02] the body.
[1:17:04] Now in Acts chapter 8
[1:17:08] we find out that there was a man
[1:17:13] supposedly a black man from Ethiopia
[1:17:16] from the court of Candice. He had gone
[1:17:18] to Jerusalem. He's returning a devout
[1:17:21] man, a man of authority. He has the
[1:17:24] scriptures. He's learned enough. He can
[1:17:26] even read it. But he couldn't understand
[1:17:28] it. And this is what is good about the
[1:17:31] word. Even when he couldn't understand
[1:17:34] it, the Lord manifested in his favor.
[1:17:38] The word that he couldn't understand,
[1:17:40] still God came in his favor. Don't stop
[1:17:43] feeding on the word, brother.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Don't stop feeding on the word, my
[1:17:46] sister.
[1:17:49] And so he's reading the word
[1:17:51] and then God sends his man. He calls
[1:17:54] Philillip say go there go and join the
[1:17:56] guy. And so he joins him. What was God
[1:18:00] doing at this point? He was sending a
[1:18:02] man who has re received a revealed word
[1:18:06] so that through the body seed could be
[1:18:08] deed in the bride.
[1:18:11] So he looks at him he's reading. Now the
[1:18:13] Bible doesn't say he was reading loud
[1:18:16] but I can tell you that Philip heard him
[1:18:18] reading
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and so he heard he hears him reading and
[1:18:21] says do you understand what you are
[1:18:23] reading say how can I if nobody explains
[1:18:25] to me come come and sit by me and so he
[1:18:29] goes and sits by him and then they start
[1:18:32] reading
[1:18:33] and then as he was reading as is the
[1:18:36] prophet talking about himself or another
[1:18:39] and that's the opening for Philillip and
[1:18:41] the Bible says he preached Jesus unto
[1:18:43] him.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you know the book of the
[1:18:47] acts was written as an example for us.
[1:18:49] He preached Jesus unto him. What it
[1:18:52] doesn't say is that he preached baptism
[1:18:54] in water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:56] Christ too. Because after he preached
[1:18:59] and he preached and he preached and the
[1:19:01] man got convinced the moment they saw
[1:19:04] water, the man says, "This is water.
[1:19:08] What stops me from getting baptized?"
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:12] Meanwhile, in the Old Testament, and
[1:19:13] that's all the Bible they had. There was
[1:19:15] no New Testament. They were the New
[1:19:17] Testament in writing. And in the Old
[1:19:19] Testament, the word baptism even doesn't
[1:19:21] appear. The word baptized does not even
[1:19:24] appear. So, Philillip preached baptism
[1:19:29] to him.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Here is the water. What
[1:19:32] stops you?" Why? A child of God, a part
[1:19:36] of the body of Christ that has the seed
[1:19:39] is being deposited. for life.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; This is what happened. And we see it
[1:19:46] repeated again in chapter nine where
[1:19:49] Paul is going. Saul is going to cut the
[1:19:53] Christians. He's going to put them to
[1:19:55] jail and things like that. And then he
[1:19:57] meets the Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[1:19:59] smitten blind. Jesus does not talk to
[1:20:01] him. Jesus does not say, "Okay, here the
[1:20:04] scripture says this, that and preach to
[1:20:05] him." No.
[1:20:08] Why? He was no longer in the flesh.
[1:20:11] But he sent him to part of his body that
[1:20:15] has the seed. And so he goes into h
[1:20:20] Damascus
[1:20:22] and then he sends Ananas to his house.
[1:20:25] Go to him. Ananas goes, speaks to him,
[1:20:29] prays for him. He gets healed of his
[1:20:31] blindness and the word says he got
[1:20:33] baptized right away.
[1:20:37] So Ananas also preached Jesus and
[1:20:40] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:41] Christ to him
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; and when he obeyed the Bible says
[1:20:46] straight away he started preaching that
[1:20:49] Jesus is the Lord.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Acts chapter 10. I know we
[1:20:55] have a little time. Acts chapter 10.
[1:20:59] Cornelius,
[1:21:01] an angel appears to him. He's a devout
[1:21:02] man. He has given arms. He's risen up to
[1:21:05] the Lord. Everybody knows that this a
[1:21:06] good man. An angel appears to him. The
[1:21:10] angel that don't say, "Okay, here is the
[1:21:12] Bible. This is why Jesus did do this, do
[1:21:14] that."
[1:21:16] In my own sense, I was think that if an
[1:21:18] angel is speaking to you, maybe it'll be
[1:21:20] more believable. But that is not God's
[1:21:22] way. God says, "No, send and call one of
[1:21:26] my children
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; who has a seed. Praise the name of the
[1:21:31] Lord."
[1:21:32] And so Peter comes there
[1:21:35] and speaks to him and the Bible says
[1:21:37] even while he was speaking they received
[1:21:39] the Holy Spirit.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So this is
[1:21:43] what I'm saying and I'm trying to draw
[1:21:45] attention to that for the gospel to go
[1:21:48] forth and I hope you don't think I'm
[1:21:51] doing any criticism here. It takes more
[1:21:54] than tapes.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I listen to tapes. I love tapes. I would
[1:22:01] want them played here. I would want
[1:22:03] everybody to listen to them. But a man
[1:22:06] has to preach the gospel.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; More than that, a man has to live the
[1:22:10] gospel.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure why. Anyway, I'll just keep
[1:22:29] through some of the the next quote is uh
[1:22:33] from Smeirnan church age. Brother Ram
[1:22:36] says in every age we have exactly the
[1:22:38] same pattern. That is why the light
[1:22:41] comes through some god-given messenger
[1:22:44] in a certain area and then from that
[1:22:46] messenger they express the light through
[1:22:48] the ministry of others who have been
[1:22:51] faithfully thought.
[1:22:54] I like the fact that I underlined it,
[1:22:55] faithfully thought and it is
[1:22:57] intentional. Because you see, to be
[1:22:59] faithfully thought, you have to be
[1:23:01] willing to learn.
[1:23:04] A lot of times to we we go through a lot
[1:23:08] of things and learn this theology and
[1:23:10] listen to the great preacher and great
[1:23:12] minister and on and on and on. And then
[1:23:14] if the Lord shows us grace, we pounce
[1:23:16] upon the message and then we hold on to
[1:23:19] what we have and we think it's something
[1:23:21] and yes, it's something out there. It's
[1:23:24] not wrong. It's something out there and
[1:23:26] it was the word for another age. It's
[1:23:28] it's good. It's great. But to have life
[1:23:31] today, this is it.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And so we hold on. We hold on. And then
[1:23:36] we are losing something. We need to be
[1:23:39] faithfully taught. That's what the
[1:23:42] scripture says. But of course, all those
[1:23:44] who go out don't always learn how
[1:23:46] necessary
[1:23:48] it is to speak only what the messenger
[1:23:51] has spoken.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And for this, I want the believers to
[1:23:54] say, "Amen."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Remember Paul warned the
[1:24:00] people to say only what he said."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:07] Now what the difference and what the
[1:24:09] distinction here
[1:24:11] think of Apollos
[1:24:14] great powerful minister
[1:24:16] calls him a baptist preacher and he says
[1:24:18] at that place calls him a lawyer
[1:24:21] he received something he call some
[1:24:22] revelation went all the way up to John's
[1:24:24] baptism that's it and he's powerful and
[1:24:27] he's preaching and he's doing things
[1:24:32] and he passes through Ephesus
[1:24:35] and he preaches and people get
[1:24:37] converted.
[1:24:39] But you see by the time Paul got to
[1:24:41] those people they had not received the
[1:24:44] Holy Spirit.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; It takes a person who has received the
[1:24:49] revealed word who has the seed to
[1:24:53] deposit the seed.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So he
[1:24:59] preached to them. They have believed.
[1:25:00] The Bible calls them disciples. But when
[1:25:03] they asked them say we we don't even
[1:25:04] know that there is holy spirit you know
[1:25:07] Apollos himself was lacking but when he
[1:25:09] went elsewhere to preach and he met a
[1:25:11] prisoner they went to his meeting he is
[1:25:14] the man preaching they listen to him
[1:25:17] they didn't challenge him and then they
[1:25:19] invited him and the bible says they
[1:25:21] revealed to him the more perfect way
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and because he was a seed he did not
[1:25:28] move his head and say no no no I'm the
[1:25:30] preacher I'm the no he accepted head it
[1:25:33] now understand it though that getting
[1:25:35] into the body is not the same as
[1:25:36] depositing seed like I'm saying I have a
[1:25:39] head I have a hands I have legs they are
[1:25:41] all good for me
[1:25:43] but those don't deposit seed I can't go
[1:25:46] further than that but that is the the
[1:25:48] reality of things praise the name of the
[1:25:50] living God
[1:25:54] so the word is still the same today
[1:25:57] and men who have received the revealed
[1:26:00] word still have a duty to preach the
[1:26:02] word. Glory to God.
[1:26:05] I'm getting to a place where I can stop.
[1:26:09] So from the beginning of the church
[1:26:10] ages,
[1:26:12] God has had different promises to
[1:26:15] different ages. Now for of all the ages,
[1:26:18] we are the only age that has the promise
[1:26:22] not just of resurrection but rapture
[1:26:23] too. We are the only age that has the
[1:26:27] promise of a body change.
[1:26:29] Now the age
[1:26:35] that receives a promise also receives an
[1:26:38] allorted word to fulfill the promise. So
[1:26:41] the message of Luther completely
[1:26:43] scriptural but it not produce a body
[1:26:45] change in this age.
[1:26:48] Westless message completely scriptural
[1:26:50] will not produce the promise for today.
[1:26:53] The message in every age met the
[1:26:56] conditions of the age.
[1:26:58] Now we are in the final age. Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] It will take the message of the hour
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; to produce the promise of this hour.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Now in identifying Christ of all ages,
[1:27:13] Abraham says all what those prophets
[1:27:15] were that was God in those prophets.
[1:27:19] Jesus said, "So you called them God so
[1:27:21] the word of God came to and here I am
[1:27:24] the son of God. How do you condemn me,
[1:27:27] oh vine? The same thing is today. It's
[1:27:30] God manifested in flesh. Watch this
[1:27:32] carefully. He said the same is today.
[1:27:36] The same thing that was happening then
[1:27:39] is today. But now what the three things
[1:27:42] that he used to reference to the message
[1:27:44] is God manifested in flesh. The message
[1:27:47] of the hour, the light of the day.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Then he says we can't have them other
[1:27:53] messages back there. They have done been
[1:27:56] lived up. We live in a glare of light.
[1:28:00] Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] I I I'll just
[1:28:05] finish
[1:28:08] now. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:23] So I just want to draw attention to this
[1:28:25] that there are many things that Jesus
[1:28:27] did and he did them as a unique sign
[1:28:31] that identifies him to the extent that
[1:28:34] he said even the things that I'm telling
[1:28:36] you if you don't believe it believe me
[1:28:38] for the signs sake. So the signs were
[1:28:41] unique to convince.
[1:28:43] Now you can go through those signs and
[1:28:46] see if there is any of them that has not
[1:28:48] been revealed today.
[1:28:50] That has not been revealed in this
[1:28:52] ministry.
[1:28:54] Praise the name of the living God.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And so when God does it and only he does
[1:28:59] what he does and when he does it, it is
[1:29:03] to tell us something. And I believe
[1:29:05] personally that only the bride will
[1:29:06] recognize it. Anyway, let me go quickly.
[1:29:09] The anointed ones at the end time.
[1:29:11] Brother says, "Now I want you to know
[1:29:12] this is sure and you that listen to this
[1:29:16] tape talking to us. You might have
[1:29:18] thought today that I was trying to say
[1:29:20] that about myself being that I was
[1:29:21] packing this message. I am no I have no
[1:29:24] more to do with it than nothing. No more
[1:29:26] than just a voice. And my voice even
[1:29:29] against my better judgment. I wanted to
[1:29:31] be a trapper, but it's the will of my
[1:29:33] father that I declare to do and
[1:29:35] determined to do. I wasn't the one that
[1:29:37] appeared down at the river." You all
[1:29:39] know what he's referring to.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he
[1:29:43] appeared. I'm not the one that performs
[1:29:46] these things and for tells these things
[1:29:47] that happens as perfect as they are. I
[1:29:50] I'm only the one that is near when he
[1:29:52] does it. Can it be more sincere than
[1:29:55] this?
[1:29:57] I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:29:59] it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I
[1:30:03] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:30:05] through. It isn't me. It wasn't the
[1:30:09] seventh angel. These two things are
[1:30:12] saying the same thing. It isn't me. It
[1:30:14] wasn't the seventh angel. Oh no. It was
[1:30:17] the manifestation of the son of man.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was
[1:30:24] the mystery that God unfolded. It's not
[1:30:27] a man. It's God.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:35] Hallelujah.
[1:30:37] So this is what is happening. Those
[1:30:40] signs are there to convince us. But I
[1:30:42] believe that most of us never witness
[1:30:44] any of those signs. At least not in the
[1:30:46] ministry of Abraham with either not
[1:30:49] alive or too little and yet we are here.
[1:30:52] What does that tell you? That you have
[1:30:54] believed the sign. Oh rather you believe
[1:30:57] the voice of the sign. And that is more
[1:31:00] important. If what called you
[1:31:05] is the voice, praise the name of the
[1:31:07] Lord, then it's a greater uh level of
[1:31:10] grace than the sign. Hallelujah.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] Try this.
[1:31:19] Yes. Now, everyone, Reverend, this is
[1:31:23] our hope is in God. I want everyone to
[1:31:25] be aware that the things that I speak is
[1:31:27] not myself. That's not my voice. It's my
[1:31:30] voice but not me using it. Hallelujah.
[1:31:34] So who is using that voice?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; This is a God who does not do anything
[1:31:42] by chance. He never does any. No,
[1:31:46] he means what he is doing and it's for a
[1:31:48] purpose. And you and I are the purpose.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:00] gifts and callings are without
[1:32:01] repentance. Arab says he told me if I
[1:32:04] get the people to believe
[1:32:08] me said that seems strange for me to
[1:32:11] have to say this you believe in me said
[1:32:15] aren't you supposed to believe God
[1:32:18] you must believe that you must believe
[1:32:20] God and believe Christ and believe the
[1:32:22] Holy Ghost then after believing all of
[1:32:24] them God wants you to believe me
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; when it gets to this point we have to
[1:32:31] make a choice whether we are believers
[1:32:33] or not. Hallelujah. If you believe the
[1:32:37] man, then this is what he's saying.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And believe
[1:32:41] me goes beyond, oh, it's reasonable. Oh,
[1:32:44] I agree.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So, if I'm supposed to believe it, then
[1:32:54] how do I prove it? Hallelujah.
[1:32:58] So it's by the scripture first of all
[1:33:02] because every revelation no revelation
[1:33:04] should go contrary to this word
[1:33:07] but after that it's also by vindication.
[1:33:11] Hallelujah. Because there is something
[1:33:13] that moves God.
[1:33:16] Complete obedience will always move him.
[1:33:19] Praise the name of the living God. Let
[1:33:22] me go to this quickly. I said therefore
[1:33:24] speaking face speaking face to face with
[1:33:26] this supernatural being that is brother
[1:33:28] Abraham I believe it with all my heart I
[1:33:32] was talking about his experience and if
[1:33:34] I can get you to believe me with all
[1:33:36] your heart that's what moves Godmen
[1:33:41] so it's not just oh okay I believe him
[1:33:43] with all my but this guy is also good
[1:33:45] and oh this person and this one and this
[1:33:48] I got a dream and this I got this
[1:33:49] revelation
[1:33:52] okay we've tried that for many years.
[1:33:55] Can we now focus on this one and see
[1:33:57] what the Lord does? Praise the name of
[1:33:59] the living God.
[1:34:02] Hallelujah. I'll skip some of these.
[1:34:07] And so I'll call the musicians. It's
[1:34:10] 9:00. I don't want to take too much
[1:34:12] time.
[1:34:15] And um I'll read this last one.
[1:34:21] This is God's power to transform.
[1:34:25] Now, it's hard. It's hard to say this.
[1:34:27] It's very hard because speaking to the
[1:34:29] people who feel the same way I do and
[1:34:32] the way I have been for many years. But
[1:34:35] since the opening of those seven seals
[1:34:37] and of them angels just behind the
[1:34:39] mountain yonder, this
[1:34:42] has become a new book.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And this is something that we have to
[1:34:49] take very seriously
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; because this Bible has been there for
[1:34:54] 2,000 years
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; and it has done what it was meant to do
[1:35:01] and we have to just be careful about it
[1:35:07] because it's the new book that sets us
[1:35:09] apart.
[1:35:11] is the new book that you read and you
[1:35:13] know that you are the bride. It's this
[1:35:16] new book that will tell you not just
[1:35:19] that you are forgiven but you never did
[1:35:20] it in the first place. It's this new
[1:35:23] book that tells you about
[1:35:26] your relationship with the Lord Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ. It is this new book that will
[1:35:32] tell you about your future home.
[1:35:35] Hallelujah. And so when you miss the new
[1:35:38] book, you are reading from the same old
[1:35:40] book and many a times this old book has
[1:35:43] a lot of condemnation.
[1:35:45] Praise the name of the Lord. But God has
[1:35:48] given us a new book. Not another this
[1:35:51] same book. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:35:53] But through the lenses of the message,
[1:35:55] you get a new book. Praise the name of
[1:35:58] the Lord. Let's not reject it.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Let's not underestimate it. It is meant
[1:36:06] for our salvation. It is meant for our
[1:36:08] healing. It is meant for our
[1:36:10] deliverance. It is meant for every
[1:36:12] aspect of all we are. Hallelujah.
[1:36:15] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; May God be with us all. May we may he
[1:36:26] strengthen us to live the word.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:36:30] I was going to mention but I forgot that
[1:36:34] we have visitors among us. Brother Boss,
[1:36:38] God bless you. And I think it's the
[1:36:40] brother-in-law, brother Sam. God bless
[1:36:43] you. We hope you're feel welcomed.
[1:36:48] Shall we be on our feet?
[1:36:59] So you think uh keep me true.
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:19] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true.
[1:37:26] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true.
[1:37:34] There's a race that I must run. There
[1:37:38] are victories to be won. Give me power
[1:37:43] every hour to be true.
[1:37:48] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true.
[1:37:55] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Give me true.
[1:38:02] There's a race that I must run. There
[1:38:06] are victories to be won. Give me power.
[1:38:11] Every hour be true.
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:16] Amen.
[1:38:19] Let's bow down our hearts.
[1:38:22] Precious Lord,
[1:38:26] we thank you for this time of refreshing
[1:38:28] in your presence.
[1:38:30] We thank you for your love. We thank you
[1:38:32] for your provision.
[1:38:34] We thank you that you chose to present
[1:38:37] this present truth to us.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; We thank you that you gave us what it
[1:38:42] takes to embrace it. Father, we pray
[1:38:45] that you help us to focus on it, that
[1:38:48] you help us to feed on it, that you help
[1:38:50] us to live by it, that you help us to
[1:38:53] see it manifested in flesh, Lord,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord, and we desire more of
[1:39:00] you, oh Lord.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Father, in all this chopped up way that
[1:39:05] I presented this, may the Holy Ghost
[1:39:08] take it and interpret it to the hearts
[1:39:09] of your children. Lord, bless us, Lord.
[1:39:12] Oh Lord, as we come to the end of this
[1:39:15] uh service, lead a sly home. Be with
[1:39:18] every one of us, oh God. And
[1:39:22] help us, oh Lord, to be mindful of what
[1:39:25] you've done for us.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Help us to be reminded constantly, Lord.
[1:39:29] Make a way for us to set a time to set
[1:39:32] time aside with you that we can always
[1:39:35] be in your presence regardless of where
[1:39:37] we are, Lord. Because this is a time and
[1:39:40] season that the bride must stay close to
[1:39:42] its groom and the groom is the revealed
[1:39:46] word Lord. Help us Lord to appreciate
[1:39:49] you oh Lord to depend completely on you
[1:39:51] oh Lord to throw away everything else
[1:39:54] that we have oh Lord that you will have
[1:39:56] permanence in our lives oh Lord bless us
[1:39:59] Lord and thank you again we love and
[1:40:02] appreciate you master in the name of the
[1:40:04] Lord Jesus Christ do we pray. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
