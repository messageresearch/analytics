========================================

There's a holy [singing] and beautiful city whose builder [singing] and ruler is gone. John saw it descending [singing] from heaven when Patmos [singing] in exile. It's high massive wallies of jasper. The city [singing] itself is [music] pure gold. And when my filth and [singing] tear is folded, mine high [singing] shall its glory [music] behold. In the [singing] bright city, pearly white city. [singing] I have [singing] a [music] mansion. I have in the crowd. Now [music and singing] I am watching. I'm waiting and [singing] longing for the white city. Your soul coming down. No sin [singing] is [music] allowed in that city and [music] nothing [singing] defileing on me. No pain [singing] and no sickness can [music] enter. No creep on [singing] the door nor be seen. It sorrows and [singing] cares are forgotten. No tempter is there [singing and music] to annoy. No part [singing] in words ever spoken. There's [singing and music] nothing to hurt and destroy in [singing] that bright city. Pearly [singing] white city. I have a [singing and music] manion. I have in the [singing] crowd. Now I am watching. I'm waiting and longing [singing and music] for the [singing] white city. John saw coming [singing and music] down. No heartaches are known in that city. [singing] No tears ever moist in the high. [singing and music] There's no disappointment in heaven. [singing] No envy [music] and strife in the sky. The saints [singing and music] are all sanified. Holy. They live in sweet [music and singing] harmony there. My heart is now [singing] set on that city. And someday blessings [singing] I'll share in that [singing] bright city. Early [singing and music] white 16. I [singing] have a [music] manion. I [singing] have in the ground. Now [singing] I am watching. [music and singing] I'm waiting and longing [music] for [singing] the white city. [music] John saw coming down. My loved ones [singing and music] are gathering yonder. My [music] friends too [singing] are passing away. And soon [music and singing] I shall join their bright number and dwell [singing and music] in eternity day. Yes, safe [singing and music] now in glory with Jesus. Their trials and [music and singing] battles are past. They [singing] overcome sin and the tempter. [music] They've reached that [singing] first city at last. In that bright city, [singing] pray white city. [music] I [singing] have a manion. [music] I have in [music] the [singing] ground. Now I am watching. I'm waiting and [singing and music] longing for the white city just [singing and music] so coming down. [singing] [applause] Folks,
