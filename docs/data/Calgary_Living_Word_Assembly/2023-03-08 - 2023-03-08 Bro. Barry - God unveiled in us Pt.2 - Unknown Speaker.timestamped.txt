[29:43] I uh I just want to bring you greetings
[29:46] from down south we'll get into that a
[29:47] little bit later tonight I guess but
[29:50] certainly glad to be back

[29:54] make it known unto the Lord with an
[29:55] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer
[29:57] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[29:59] you for your goodness to us Lord father
[30:02] I don't think we would ever have enough
[30:04] words to thank you Father for what
[30:06] you've done for us in this day
[30:08] Lord God we're just so grateful and
[30:11] tonight father we've count this a
[30:13] tremendous honor and a privilege Lord to
[30:15] gather together in the name above every
[30:17] name father Lord we sang the song Lord
[30:21] we desire for you to fill this place
[30:24] with your spirit Lord but father let it
[30:27] not be this building Lord Jesus let it
[30:29] be truly the hearts of your children
[30:31] tonight father let that be the place
[30:34] that you fill with your spirit Lord God
[30:36] outside of that Lord Jesus it's all for
[30:39] naught so father we just asked tonight
[30:41] that you would just fill us with your
[30:43] spirit if we've never had that
[30:45] experience tonight Lord I pray in the
[30:47] name of Jesus Christ that you would
[30:48] Grant it and father we pray that Lord
[30:51] many of us myself included we need a
[30:54] filling up Lord Jesus of that oil Lord
[30:56] of your Holy Ghost your spirit Lord
[30:59] Jesus none of us are exempt from it
[31:01] that's why we come to church Lord so we
[31:03] can take our cups and lift them up unto
[31:05] you and say Lord top me up father
[31:07] because I know some time you're coming
[31:09] and unless I'm full of oil I will not be
[31:12] able to go with you father when you take
[31:14] your bride so tonight we just ask father
[31:16] that you would just bless us one more
[31:18] time with your presence father that you
[31:20] would fill us with your spirit that you
[31:22] would bless us with your word father
[31:24] Lord that you would just pour yourself
[31:26] out father without measure tonight Lord
[31:29] knowing that you have just as much and
[31:31] more to give us father as we desire we
[31:34] know that your Prophet said that where
[31:35] there's a deep calling there's a deep to
[31:37] respond and tonight father we deeply
[31:39] call unto you that you would respond
[31:41] father in a mighty way Lord we ask that
[31:44] you admit each request that is made
[31:45] known unto you tonight with an uplift
[31:47] hand father that you would be with those
[31:49] who were traveling father that you would
[31:51] give them traveling mercies father that
[31:53] you would just Lord be with those who
[31:55] couldn't come tonight for whatever the
[31:56] reason Lord Jesus you know and we pray
[31:59] that you would just bless them Father
[32:00] Lord we ask all these things now in the
[32:04] name above every name that our Lord
[32:05] Jesus Christ amen
[32:08] bless you tonight welcome welcome
[32:10] welcome
[32:10] certainly glad to be home and uh
[32:13] excited for the word tonight
[32:16] thank you musicians
[32:18] do you have your Bibles I'd like to read
[32:19] from First Peter chapter 3.
[32:24] similar topic
[32:26] just a different angle
[32:28] talking about husbands and wives and
[32:30] children and
[32:32] Sons and Daughters of God
[32:35] bride of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost
[32:38] the word for our day
[32:42] First Peter chapter 3 verse 1.
[32:45] says likewise ye wives be in subjection
[32:48] to your own husbands
[32:51] that if any obey not the word they also
[32:55] May without the word
[32:57] be won by the conversation of the wives
[33:01] while they behold your Chase
[33:03] conversation
[33:05] coupled with fear
[33:06] who's adorning let it not be that
[33:09] outward adorning of planting
[33:11] planting the hair and of wearing of gold
[33:15] or of putting on of apparel
[33:18] but let it be the hidden man of the
[33:20] heart
[33:21] in that which is not corruptable even
[33:24] the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit
[33:27] which is in the sight of God a great
[33:30] price
[33:31] for after this manner in the old time
[33:34] the holy women also who trusted in God
[33:36] adorned themselves being in subjection
[33:38] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[33:41] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[33:44] daughters ye are as long as you do well
[33:47] and are not afraid with any amazement
[33:51] likewise the husbands dwell with them
[33:53] according to knowledge
[33:55] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[33:57] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[34:00] together of the grace of life that your
[34:02] prayers be not hindered let's just bow
[34:05] in prayer one more time
[34:07] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[34:09] your word thank you for this word Lord
[34:11] that was given throughout the ages Lord
[34:13] translated father through many different
[34:16] hands and minds and and mouths Lord
[34:19] Jesus father it's come through so many
[34:21] different channels Lord Jesus but we
[34:23] know that for today it's the word that
[34:26] you had prepared for us before the
[34:28] foundation of the world Lord Jesus so
[34:31] that we could receive it the way that we
[34:32] need to receive it father there's no
[34:34] other word there's no other direction
[34:36] there's no other place that you've
[34:39] provided other than your word and father
[34:40] we take it and we accept it the way that
[34:43] you've given it to us Lord and we just
[34:45] ask now that you would just open our
[34:47] eyes of understanding father that you
[34:48] would just take this bread of life that
[34:50] we have read again one more time tonight
[34:52] and just make it real unto us father
[34:54] Lord we'll be careful to give you all
[34:56] the praise and all the glory we just ask
[34:59] that we could Commit This service now

[36:02] means come and just Express what's on
[36:05] your heart let the joy of the Lord be
[36:07] your strength just make a Joyful Noise
[36:09] unto the Lord and I'm sure that if you
[36:12] have the right motive and the right
[36:13] objective that he will receive it if we
[36:16] come and we want to do something
[36:17] according to the world or something that
[36:19] we've been influenced from from the
[36:20] outside it's it's maybe not going to be
[36:23] well received but it's for if it's from
[36:25] the inside of the inside then that's
[36:27] where we're going to actually bring a
[36:29] Joyful Noise unto the Lord so on the
[36:31] 19th we're going to have one of those
[36:33] special services again
[36:34] I just think it's wonderful every time
[36:36] we sing that song uh Lord feed your
[36:39] children I can't help but think about
[36:40] brother mental Friesen I remember him
[36:42] singing that song when he was here it
[36:44] just uh does something to me when we
[36:45] sing that song
[36:47] makes me think of the Old Timers the
[36:48] generals that have been on the on the
[36:50] front lines for decades and decades and
[36:54] uh the things that they've gone through
[36:55] and you know just to remain balanced in
[36:59] in the midst of it all not not to skew
[37:01] one way or the other and some people
[37:03] might say that uh some of the old timers
[37:06] get a little bit harder but I think what
[37:07] happens they don't necessarily get
[37:09] harder they get less tolerant for
[37:11] nonsense
[37:12] and I think that that's really uh it's
[37:13] not a bad thing because sometimes you
[37:16] can get caught up dealing with
[37:17] distractions the devil wants anything
[37:19] that can distract our attention he'll
[37:21] use it and and he'll stir something up
[37:24] over here in the church and get us to go
[37:25] over here and try and deal with this
[37:27] thing and while we're dealing with that
[37:29] then he'll stir something up over there
[37:30] and while that's happening over there
[37:32] it's just uh it's just a devil
[37:35] and we recognize his tactics and we know
[37:38] that we have the greatest thing that's
[37:39] ever happened to this world that's the
[37:41] word of God that's what we have and
[37:43] that's what's in our midst and I'm going
[37:44] to bring the quote tonight but brothers
[37:46] and sisters I just want to say it this
[37:48] way I believe that truly we are
[37:50] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[37:52] our midst we're not looking for a
[37:54] greater word we're not looking for
[37:56] another word some people might be but
[37:58] I'm sorry I can't bring anything
[38:00] different than what the prophet said and
[38:01] I will never intend to I will only
[38:03] Endeavor to bring what the prophet said
[38:05] for our age because somebody has to be
[38:08] the recipient of what the word said for
[38:10] us in our day someone has to be the one
[38:13] that's going to go on the Rapture some
[38:15] people will go on the grave and that's
[38:16] the Lord's choice but we know that they
[38:18] will rise first and and then we who are
[38:21] alive and remain will will gather
[38:23] together with them and meet him in the
[38:24] air meet Jesus Christ in the air and I
[38:27] heard something so fantastic in in in in
[38:29] in in the South this this weekend and I
[38:31] thought it was just good it was brother
[38:33] Wayne it was you know just down home
[38:34] preaching and in the South it was so
[38:36] neat to see him in his element
[38:38] but you know what he said was that the
[38:41] Lord Jesus and there's a quote for it
[38:43] but the Lord has actually there will
[38:45] come a time when the Rapture happens
[38:46] where he just expands Heaven down and
[38:49] what happens is the dimension is not
[38:51] somewhere way out there beyond the
[38:53] universe it's right here that Dimension
[38:55] is right here and this Dimension will
[38:57] slightly speed up and that Dimension
[38:59] will slightly slow down and he will
[39:01] expand Heaven he'll stretch heaven and
[39:03] he'll use that Jacob's Ladder and I'm
[39:05] not going to try and preach his sermon
[39:06] tonight but I just found it so so
[39:08] fascinating because someone is going to
[39:11] be there someone has to be there for the
[39:13] Rapture to happen someone has to be
[39:15] alive on Earth to see the dead come
[39:17] forth from the grace brother Branham
[39:19] said it 30 to 40 days
[39:21] about a month he said 30 to 40 days some
[39:24] some people are going to start seeing
[39:26] people and you know he said it on the
[39:28] weekend brother Wayne did and I just I
[39:30] believe that it goes beyond brother
[39:31] Wayne speaking I believe that it was the
[39:32] Holy Ghost speaker I want to hear from
[39:34] the Lord when I went to church on Sunday
[39:36] and I believe that he spoke to me and he
[39:38] said just any minute now just any minute
[39:40] now don't don't don't be waiting for 10
[39:42] years or 15 years just live like he's
[39:44] coming right now because any moment now
[39:47] everything in our lives could change I
[39:49] mean we saw it happen with covet here in
[39:51] Calgary just in a moment we heard people
[39:53] talking about it they were talking about
[39:55] it oh yeah there's talk about it there
[39:56] was talk about it but then eventually it
[39:58] happened and everything shut down we've
[40:00] talked about the Rapture we've talked
[40:01] about the message we've talked about the
[40:03] word and one of these days brothers and
[40:04] sisters it's going and I just want to be
[40:07] one of them and I want to try and
[40:08] encourage everyone who is here to be one
[40:11] of them
[40:13] and I'll say it it's not up to us it's
[40:15] not up to me to put anyone in or out I
[40:17] just want to bring as many with me as I
[40:19] can
[40:19] that's all
[40:21] when uh we we had such a wonderful time
[40:24] it was just my goodness thank you for
[40:26] your patience with me to be able to go I
[40:29] I really have something very clear on my
[40:31] heart now
[40:33] um that I've discovered since traveling
[40:35] even when we went to Philippines and and
[40:37] that is it goes back to even Australia
[40:39] when I went there you know maybe it
[40:41] sounds fascinating that I've put on
[40:43] Miles and I've gone to these places and
[40:45] met the people and it's it's neat to say
[40:47] that we've done that but my heart's
[40:49] desire is right here it's not out on the
[40:51] road somewhere traveling I believe that
[40:53] the Lord has a five-fold Ministry for a
[40:55] purpose and people have a desire in
[40:57] their heart to go and travel and to take
[40:59] the word and they're called evangelists
[41:01] some are teachers some can teach here or
[41:04] or away and some are pastors and I think
[41:06] I've just discovered that really my
[41:08] calling is not abroad it's right here
[41:10] this is my desire every time I go away I
[41:13] just can't help but think about here but
[41:15] I want to say tonight to everyone
[41:18] aren't we thankful for the church we
[41:20] have aren't we thankful for the body of
[41:22] Believers we have in Calgary here this
[41:25] is the Lord's work
[41:27] I'll give a hand clap too because it's
[41:29] unto the Lord
[41:31] you know sometimes when we go to a
[41:33] different place and you start to hear
[41:35] some of the different stories in and
[41:37] amongst the churches goodness sakes we
[41:40] are very blessed here brothers and
[41:42] sisters very blessed here and I'm not
[41:44] trying to blow any horn except forgive
[41:46] God all the praise and all the glory
[41:47] we've said it for years I've heard it
[41:50] said there's nothing that would
[41:51] ordinarily take us out of the world if
[41:53] we weren't Believers and make us
[41:55] Fellowship together
[41:57] the thing we have in common here is
[41:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[42:01] and forever
[42:02] but to see the unity in the body here is
[42:05] tremendous God bless each one of you
[42:08] you know I want to say it this way too
[42:10] the devil just wants to get us
[42:11] distracted I've already said it but he
[42:12] wants to get us distracted that's his
[42:14] tactics and he's going to use anything
[42:16] within his power to distract us from the
[42:19] word because there's only one thing
[42:20] that's going to save our bodies change
[42:22] our bodies in this age it's the word the
[42:24] word and the word alone we're not going
[42:26] to be able to do it on our own I caught
[42:29] a tremendous Revelation and I'm not
[42:30] afraid to say it that that it's simply
[42:33] this I thought for the longest time
[42:34] there was some way that I needed to pray
[42:37] there is somehow that I needed to pray
[42:40] there was some thing that I needed to
[42:43] pray in order to see my prayer get
[42:46] answered before the Lord I had to maybe
[42:48] behave good for a week or two or three
[42:51] or four or five or ten or maybe 10 years
[42:53] I had to have a certain Behavior to see
[42:56] the the activation of God's word come to
[42:58] pass in my life if I was to pray for
[43:00] something you know what that's that's
[43:02] not true that's a lie of the devil what
[43:04] that is is its works and we were talking
[43:06] about this before I just think it's so
[43:08] clear the distraction from the devil if
[43:10] if we're we're we're needling on works
[43:13] and saying that this has to happen and
[43:14] if it doesn't happen according to the
[43:15] way that I think it should happen then
[43:17] it's not gonna it's not gonna be the
[43:18] spirit of God if we're doing that
[43:19] brothers and sisters what's happening is
[43:21] we're just getting caught up in in
[43:22] needing milk we need a bottle according
[43:25] to the word of God when we should be at
[43:27] the place where we're eating steaks
[43:29] where we're eating strong meat because
[43:31] the little things aren't going to bother
[43:33] us we're going to come to church and
[43:34] we're going to shout for Joy just like
[43:36] the sons of God shouted for Joy back
[43:39] when job saw before the foundation of
[43:40] the world the morning star sang together
[43:42] and the sons of God Shadow for Joy the
[43:44] prophet in our day said that was us the
[43:46] sons of God were shouting for joy
[43:49] we're going to make a Joyful Noise why
[43:50] wait till we're over there
[43:56] I had a wonderful time away
[43:58] on our commission here now today
[44:00] brothers and sisters is to find that
[44:01] last predestinated seat
[44:04] that's what it is
[44:05] if we're worried about all these other
[44:07] things in in our lives and in the church
[44:10] we're missing the point what what my
[44:12] great Revelation is that I want to tell
[44:13] you is that we don't have anything that
[44:16] we can do in our lives to bring to pass
[44:18] God's word I honestly thought for the
[44:21] longest time that my behavior was either
[44:24] going to activate or deactivate God's
[44:26] word and that's not the case what's
[44:28] going to happen is we're going to pray
[44:30] the prayer of faith and we're going to
[44:31] lay hands on the sick and the word says
[44:34] if you pray the prayer of faith then the
[44:36] Lord shall deliver them if you lay your
[44:38] hands on the sick they shall recover
[44:40] that's it we do our part he'll do his
[44:43] but if we get caught up trying to do his
[44:46] part brothers and sisters he can't do it
[44:48] he's going to stand back and say when
[44:49] are you going to let me do it you're too
[44:51] busy trying to do my part why don't you
[44:53] get into your position and just pray the
[44:57] prayer of faith and just lay your hands
[44:59] on the sick and let them just recover
[45:01] because that's my word it just hit me so
[45:03] hard it's just phenomenal and if anybody
[45:06] else has ever had a revelation like that
[45:08] I say amen and I hope someone else has
[45:11] had a revelation like that I'm not the
[45:13] only one and I know it's not the case
[45:15] and and I don't mean to sound in any way
[45:17] Pious or anything by that but sometimes
[45:19] it's just tremendous to give God the
[45:21] glory because the prophet said that we
[45:23] can never overemphasize the importance
[45:25] of Revelation to a True Believer
[45:28] my goodness I trust that all of us are
[45:30] getting revelation
[45:32] not just tonight but every time we go to
[45:35] church every time you listen to the word
[45:36] every time we we pray we're getting more
[45:39] and more and more that's why we do it
[45:42] it's just wonderful
[45:44] one of the things that came out also
[45:45] just I have oh my I have over 20 pages
[45:48] of nuggets so I'm not going to bore you
[45:51] with them all tonight but one other
[45:52] thing that came down that was just so
[45:54] good good to think about it the wrath of
[45:57] God could not fall on Jericho
[45:59] until
[46:01] who
[46:02] came out
[46:04] the Harlot
[46:05] right and not just the Harlot but for
[46:09] those people who struggle with their
[46:10] families her and her whole family
[46:13] she said give me a token I want to take
[46:15] that token and he said hey if you want
[46:17] it you got it but don't deviate from the
[46:20] from the token here don't deviate from
[46:22] the contract if you're true to your word
[46:24] then you and your family will be saved
[46:26] my goodness she was a harlot
[46:30] she wasn't the most religious person in
[46:32] the city and it's interesting because
[46:34] when spies came to her she said do you
[46:37] know that the whole enemy's Hearts melt
[46:39] within themselves because they know that
[46:41] God that is with you that God that you
[46:44] represent
[46:45] my all of the enemies melt and I I just
[46:49] think it's tremendous because brothers
[46:51] and sisters when we're in our position
[46:52] and we're not trying to bring to pass
[46:54] the word of God in our lives through
[46:55] little works that we want to try and do
[46:57] and little behaviors that we think
[46:59] should happen and all these things that
[47:00] we want to try and bring to pass when
[47:02] we're not doing all that and we're just
[47:04] simply being in our position as
[47:05] Believers as Sons and Daughters of the
[47:07] most high God trusting that he is
[47:10] responsible to bring his word to pass
[47:11] then all the devils in hell are going to
[47:14] melt before you they're going to scatter
[47:16] just like cockroaches when we're in
[47:18] Philippines we turn on the light and
[47:20] open the door in a hotel room and there
[47:21] was a cockroach just scattering for its
[47:23] life but he was a little too slow
[47:27] we had the boys with us
[47:31] so uh anyways
[47:34] enough of the preamble
[47:36] we certainly had a wonderful time and
[47:39] I almost felt guilty because down there
[47:41] they are in full full-fledged spring
[47:44] daffodils are up the grass is green it
[47:46] was about 20 degrees outside and just
[47:49] just an amazing time with the the
[47:51] brothers down there it was held at the
[47:53] apost apostolic Tabernacle in in Newton
[47:56] North Carolina I flew into Charlotte
[47:58] North Carolina and
[47:59] I I got in on Friday night I left Friday
[48:03] morning at about two in the morning I
[48:04] left my house and
[48:06] excuse me I just took the least
[48:08] expensive flight that I could find and
[48:10] it's not always the most convenient but
[48:13] I got there and I was able to get there
[48:15] just in time for the last half of the
[48:16] service while brother Wayne was
[48:18] preaching and uh it was just a wonderful
[48:20] time and what what the whole weekend was
[48:22] geared towards is a Minister's
[48:24] enrichment weekend is what they called
[48:25] it and they just talked directly to
[48:28] pastors and evangelists it was about
[48:30] evangelizing the end time message and
[48:33] and bringing the word of God to the
[48:35] Bride of Jesus Christ and then going
[48:37] into the field and trying to find that
[48:39] last predestinated seed there was so
[48:40] many really good nuggets for evangelists
[48:43] and and pastors so um the pastor of this
[48:47] church is brother Joshua Bennett I don't
[48:48] know if anybody is familiar with him
[48:50] they have quite a mix there they have a
[48:52] church that is made up of three
[48:54] different churches they had their own
[48:56] little church like this and then two
[48:58] other big churches in the area split
[49:00] over the years and so they have
[49:02] thirds and it's an interesting Dynamic
[49:05] but it works for them and they were
[49:07] there in their church for the second
[49:09] weekend and it's a brand new church
[49:12] building I don't have any pictures of it
[49:14] on hand but the building is just
[49:16] tremendous just a beautiful brand new
[49:19] building
[49:19] and the thing that I found encouraging
[49:22] was the place was full Sunday morning it
[49:25] was full and I believe there's probably
[49:27] 400 seats in that sanctuary and it was
[49:29] just loaded and uh yeah just a wonderful
[49:33] time so Pastor Joshua Bennett Josh
[49:35] Bennett sends his greetings to Calgary
[49:37] Living Word he he said make sure you
[49:39] greet the Saints there Lord willing I'd
[49:41] like to get him to come up here I think
[49:43] he's a little bit younger than myself
[49:45] and uh we'll just see Lord willing in
[49:47] time we'll see if he'll come brother
[49:50] Daryl Ward was there it was brother
[49:51] Wayne Lawson and brother Daryl Ward they
[49:53] took the services and they actually
[49:54] spoke to the the ministers that were
[49:57] present so we had a Friday evening
[49:58] service
[50:00] then we had a Saturday morning service
[50:02] and a Saturday evening service and
[50:04] Saturday in the midday after we went had
[50:07] lunch we came back to the church for a
[50:09] question and answer sort of uh
[50:11] discussion and the brother there said
[50:14] that that's a very dangerous thing to do
[50:16] and and I didn't really understand why
[50:18] I'm so thankful that's why I say I'm so
[50:20] thankful for this body of Believers here
[50:21] ignorance truly is bliss there was
[50:23] ministers there with all manner of
[50:25] different full spectrum of ministers in
[50:27] there people from tapes people from from
[50:30] going back to Pentecost to people that
[50:32] completely believe the word and all its
[50:34] its power for our day all the ministers
[50:36] were there there was I don't know maybe
[50:38] 30 or 40 of them and and they said that
[50:41] it was kind of a dangerous thing to open
[50:42] it up to questions and answers but there
[50:44] were some really good encouragement
[50:46] there things that maybe people hadn't
[50:47] thought about and uh I just thought it
[50:50] was so good one little nugget I'll give
[50:51] out for free he talked about to
[50:53] evangelists very specifically if you're
[50:55] not willing this was brother Daryl Ward
[50:57] saying if you're not willing to go and
[50:58] evangelize at a church with six people
[51:00] then you should not be going to a church
[51:02] with 600 because you got the wrong
[51:05] spirit
[51:06] you should be going to all of the Bride
[51:09] if there is someone that's laboring for
[51:11] the word then we need to take it to them
[51:13] so after that we had a Sunday morning
[51:15] service and a Sunday evening service and
[51:17] uh I just want to say you know
[51:20] where the spirit of the Lord is there's
[51:22] liberty
[51:24] and uh boy oh boy
[51:27] if we think we're loud here I mean
[51:30] they they they really worship there it
[51:33] was very very different than what we see
[51:36] here very different and I think it was
[51:38] such an amazing sight to see I've seen
[51:41] that one other time at brother Danny
[51:42] steaman's church we went to Sarasota
[51:44] Florida one time and you know what when
[51:46] the spirit of the Lord Falls people
[51:48] can't stand it it's impossible to remain
[51:52] normal when the spirit of the Lord Falls
[51:54] and it doesn't matter who you are or
[51:56] where you're at when you see it happen
[51:59] it's tremendous I've seen a lot of uh
[52:02] Pentecostal behavior that way where you
[52:04] know that it's maybe not exactly
[52:06] according to the word at the time I
[52:08] didn't know it it was just normal for me
[52:10] as a child but to know the message of
[52:12] the hour and to see people behave that
[52:13] way now you say well I get it brother
[52:15] Branham preached you know the anointed
[52:16] ones at the end time brings it out very
[52:18] clearly it's the right anointing it's
[52:20] the same anointing just on the wrong
[52:22] vessel so brothers and sisters I want to
[52:24] say tonight how much more important how
[52:26] much greater is it when we preach the
[52:29] word of God and we worship in spirit and
[52:32] in truth and the spirit of the Lord
[52:33] falls on a group of people we should be
[52:36] able to just Rejoice with Liberty to
[52:38] know that that's the spirit of the Lord
[52:40] Satan don't want no part of that in our
[52:43] midst I just think it's so wonderful and
[52:46] I mean goodness if we can't get excited
[52:48] about this what gets us excited in this
[52:49] world where do we get our Thrills
[52:51] because if this doesn't thrill us then
[52:53] there's a problem
[52:56] I think it's just amazing you know how
[52:58] we ended it brother brother Wayne said
[53:00] to me stick around another day one more
[53:02] day if you can and we'll go and tour the
[53:04] Billy Graham Library
[53:06] and so we did that
[53:08] and you know it might maybe sound carnal
[53:10] and and stuff and maybe some of it was
[53:13] but the reality for me was simply this
[53:16] they call Billy Graham
[53:19] America's pastor and the world's
[53:22] evangelist
[53:24] and the reason for that is the millions
[53:27] of people he led to Christ
[53:29] and many people would say but he didn't
[53:31] lead them to the word uh the word for
[53:32] our day and I'll say yeah he will but
[53:34] you know what I had the overwhelming
[53:35] feeling with when I was at the end of
[53:37] the tour the end of the library was
[53:39] simply this that there's two books right
[53:42] brother Branham says they're two
[53:43] separate and he says that they're one
[53:45] and the same both of those things are in
[53:47] the message of the hour one is The Book
[53:48] of Life people and one is the the Lamb's
[53:51] Book of Life people The Book of Life
[53:53] people can have their name added or
[53:54] taken off blotted on or blotted out and
[53:57] the Lamb's Book of Life people their
[53:59] name was written there before the
[54:01] foundation of the world and you know
[54:03] what if we find our name written there
[54:05] on the Lamb's Book of Life then we are
[54:07] not the ones who are evangelized by
[54:09] these two ministers that went down to
[54:11] Sodom by Oral Roberts or Billy Graham we
[54:15] know that that's what the prophet
[54:16] clearly identified in our day they were
[54:18] the two ministering angels that went
[54:19] down and preached the gospel but they
[54:22] preached to people blind to the truth
[54:24] for our day
[54:26] millions and millions of people
[54:29] the the things that that they showed
[54:31] there it was tremendous you know and I
[54:34] don't know if it would be necessarily
[54:35] his prayer I kind of think it might be
[54:37] one of the things that I saw was the
[54:39] interview and and they interviewed him
[54:42] over and over again I'm sure you could
[54:43] probably find the videos on YouTube if
[54:44] you really wanted to Billy Graham being
[54:46] interviewed by talk show host like Phil
[54:48] Donahue by by oh I can't remember the
[54:50] names but some of the hardliners some of
[54:52] the guys that really try and poke and
[54:53] ask the tough questions and really upset
[54:55] people and you know what he did he
[54:57] simply smiled and said you know what
[54:59] Jesus Christ loves you too and you
[55:01] yourself could be saved if you wanted to
[55:03] all you have to do is just ask him into
[55:06] your heart and he'll save you this
[55:08] moment and and nobody could shake him
[55:10] and all the different interviews he had
[55:12] the same anointing of that ministering
[55:14] Angel to Smite the nation blind
[55:17] while the rest of the Bride just
[55:19] received the word gladly only because he
[55:22] chose her before the foundation of the
[55:24] world it actually moved me to tears to
[55:26] get to that place where I recognized wow
[55:29] look at all these people and they
[55:31] believe they're saved and and truly they
[55:33] are to an extent but they just haven't
[55:35] been called to the calling that maybe
[55:37] everyone has been my goodness
[55:41] I'll just read a couple of quotes about
[55:42] this it just really spoke to me brother
[55:44] Branham he says that's what he did there
[55:46] he was standing there he eat the Flesh
[55:48] of a calf drank the milk from a cow eat
[55:51] bread then the two preachers the angels
[55:55] modern Billy Graham Orel Roberts
[55:57] preachers
[55:59] they had a message for the world
[56:02] so they looked towards Sodom and they
[56:04] went down there not much Miracles done
[56:07] but they blinded the people
[56:11] many people would say well they could
[56:12] see other people could see maybe the
[56:14] people in Sodom could see maybe they
[56:16] couldn't see the word says they were
[56:17] blind I don't want to dispute the fact
[56:19] that maybe their their natural vision
[56:21] was gone or or their spiritual vision
[56:23] was gone the prophet of God is bringing
[56:25] this to a natural time that we're living
[56:28] in the actual age and where we're at
[56:30] saying that it's Billy Graham and Oral
[56:32] Roberts they had a message for the world
[56:33] so they looked towards Sodom they went
[56:35] down there not much Miracles but they
[56:38] blinded the people preaching the gospel
[56:40] does blind the people that's what the
[56:43] Bible says he says look at let's look at
[56:45] this one that was sent to the church
[56:48] called out the elect Abraham's church he
[56:51] said unto Abraham now remember he was a
[56:53] stranger Abraham where is your wife
[56:55] Sarah
[56:56] how did he know he had a wife
[56:59] how did he know her name was Sarah
[57:01] and this is the sign this is the
[57:03] Messianic sign that brother Branham is
[57:05] bringing that he was able to discern the
[57:08] heart and these two Messengers to Sodom
[57:10] they weren't Discerning nothing they
[57:12] were simply going and preaching the
[57:13] gospel and blinding the people to the
[57:16] truth
[57:17] if you were to talk about the prophet of
[57:19] God in our age those people would be
[57:22] shocked they wouldn't have anything to
[57:23] do with it
[57:25] and they won't still
[57:27] another one says he'd come down and I
[57:29] want you to notice two of those angels a
[57:32] modern Billy Graham and so forth went
[57:34] out and preached to the sodomites is
[57:36] that right
[57:37] and there was only one Miracle they
[57:40] performed
[57:41] smiting them blind
[57:44] and the preaching of the Gospel smites
[57:46] blind them who doesn't believe
[57:49] but he showed them that sign to them
[57:52] down there the gospel being preached to
[57:54] come out
[57:55] he didn't call Abraham out
[57:58] I found this to just be beautiful he
[58:00] didn't call Abraham oh did he he was
[58:02] already out oh I'm so glad Abraham
[58:05] represented the elected Church the
[58:07] called out Church
[58:09] but one stayed behind with Abraham and
[58:12] he'd done a sign I want you to see what
[58:14] kind of a sign he'd done to the elected
[58:17] church and I'm not going into that too
[58:19] far tonight but I just wanted to say it
[58:21] very clearly that these two men this
[58:24] this looking at this this whole museum
[58:27] that they built for this man the whole
[58:30] world recognizes Billy Graham
[58:32] and the work that he did he went into
[58:34] the stadium when there was communism
[58:36] communist Russia he was able to get a
[58:38] visa to go into the country but he was
[58:40] forbidden to preach this was back in the
[58:42] 70s and full communism was fully
[58:44] underway there and it shows a picture of
[58:46] him praying in the Olympic stadium in
[58:49] Russia praying and and they said that he
[58:52] prayed that one day maybe he would be
[58:54] able to come and hold a campaign in this
[58:57] stadium and two decades later they have
[59:00] video of him there holding a campaign in
[59:03] that Stadium
[59:04] evangelizing the people blinding them
[59:07] smiting them blind with the word of God
[59:11] it's amazing to think about
[59:13] but you know the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:15] brothers and sisters I just can't help
[59:16] but but go here tonight I just feel it
[59:19] the Lamb's Book of Life equals humility
[59:22] because you can't put your name on it
[59:24] and you can't take your name off it he
[59:26] has called you before the foundation of
[59:28] the world there's something that he has
[59:30] done in your life and you cannot resist
[59:32] the word of God you cannot resist it
[59:34] when it comes to you and and you get
[59:36] that Revelation that we talked about
[59:37] earlier about maybe an area in your life
[59:39] or something about the word or something
[59:41] about the message of the hour when that
[59:43] Revelation strikes your heart humility
[59:45] comes in and you say oh my
[59:47] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[59:49] and and whatever I need to do to make it
[59:51] better whatever I need to do to change
[59:52] it I want to do that I don't want to to
[59:54] say oh no I've got it like yeah I've had
[59:57] it for years I don't know what you're
[59:58] talking about I can just remain the same
[1:00:00] way
[1:00:01] not the last book of life people the The
[1:00:04] Book of Life people I would say that
[1:00:05] because they would say there's some kind
[1:00:07] of word that I can do there's some kind
[1:00:09] of work that I can do thank you brother
[1:00:12] is that a sign
[1:00:16] I'll take a breath I'm not coughing this
[1:00:19] time I think it's tremendous
[1:00:21] but you know the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:22] people they're not puffed up by some
[1:00:24] kind of a tradition
[1:00:26] Matthew 15.
[1:00:28] verse 8. this people drawth nigh unto me
[1:00:31] with their mouth and honoreth me with
[1:00:33] their lips
[1:00:34] but their heart is far away from me
[1:00:37] I would say that's Book of Life people
[1:00:40] Book of Life people are the ones that
[1:00:42] really they have a religious covering
[1:00:43] they they do the same thing that that
[1:00:46] Adam and Eve did in the garden they know
[1:00:48] that God's there they they know that
[1:00:50] there's a word of God but still they
[1:00:52] have their own idea their own theory
[1:00:54] that they want to apply instead of just
[1:00:56] saying be it unto me according to Thy
[1:00:58] word for the day and you know brothers
[1:01:00] and sisters I can't express this enough
[1:01:01] just coming to church and and coming to
[1:01:04] the message church and and having the
[1:01:06] message in our lives and and just being
[1:01:09] a part of an association doesn't put you
[1:01:12] in that position the only thing that's
[1:01:14] going to do it is the new birth and the
[1:01:16] new birth brothers and sisters isn't
[1:01:18] just saying that I believe Christ died
[1:01:19] on Calvary and he died and he's going to
[1:01:21] rise or he rose again and one day he's
[1:01:23] coming back that's what the evangelists
[1:01:25] that smote the people blind with that's
[1:01:27] what they preach but we believe that
[1:01:29] he's here we believe that he's come we
[1:01:31] believe that he has actually come
[1:01:33] through a prophet and represented his
[1:01:35] word in a way that this world has never
[1:01:37] seen before this word has been fully
[1:01:39] opened for verse 9 of Matthew 15 says
[1:01:42] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:01:45] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:01:46] and and that's I just want to stress
[1:01:49] that tonight that there's no works that
[1:01:51] we're going to be able to do we're not
[1:01:52] going to be able to come and preach the
[1:01:53] doctrine uh and say this is my tradition
[1:01:55] and it's going to be good enough you
[1:01:57] know what that does is it makes us a
[1:01:59] lodge it makes us an association it it
[1:02:01] takes the power of God that Dynamic
[1:02:03] power that you talk we talk about in the
[1:02:05] it is the rising of the Sun and some of
[1:02:07] the other messages what it does is it
[1:02:09] takes that power and it grounds it out
[1:02:11] and it will pass right by us it won't
[1:02:14] even have any effect on us if we do that
[1:02:17] we need to make sure that we are not
[1:02:20] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[1:02:22] of men
[1:02:24] you know if you're here that's why I
[1:02:26] don't I don't really want to harp on it
[1:02:27] too much
[1:02:28] but to say that you know we're going to
[1:02:30] come after you if you're not here
[1:02:31] exactly one half hour before service
[1:02:34] then something's wrong with you we're
[1:02:37] going to get the deacons to come to you
[1:02:38] if you don't turn up for service we're
[1:02:40] going to send the deacons to your house
[1:02:41] someone's going to be texting you
[1:02:42] someone's going to be phoning you
[1:02:44] there's going to be problems teaching
[1:02:45] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:02:47] you don't have a tie on just right
[1:02:48] you're maybe not wearing a jacket your
[1:02:50] pants your skirts your heels on and on
[1:02:53] and on we can go but I want to say this
[1:02:55] brothers and sisters if we get people to
[1:02:57] Christ truly according to the word for
[1:02:59] our day if we get the Holy Ghost if we
[1:03:02] get the new birth we're not going to
[1:03:04] have to tell anybody anything because
[1:03:06] they're going to know
[1:03:07] and you know what if we do say something
[1:03:09] on the off chance that we do we're going
[1:03:12] to say oh my okay
[1:03:15] let me consider that it's not going to
[1:03:16] be oh my how could you say that to me
[1:03:18] how am I going to be all offended you
[1:03:20] know what that is that's not the spirit
[1:03:21] of Christ
[1:03:23] the spirit of Christ is going to have
[1:03:24] unity and want to have the bond of peace
[1:03:26] endeavoring to keep that Spirit that's
[1:03:29] what the spirit of Christ is
[1:03:32] talking about our scripture tonight I'm
[1:03:34] going to stop with that I just thought
[1:03:35] it was fascinating fascinating to see
[1:03:37] the the the the story behind one of
[1:03:41] those ministering angels that smote that
[1:03:43] the world blind
[1:03:45] we know that brother brownham went
[1:03:46] around the world seven times it's no
[1:03:48] accident that he went around the world
[1:03:49] this this word went around the world
[1:03:52] um but here we have one of those
[1:03:54] ministering angels that brother Branham
[1:03:56] said in two quotes one of those men
[1:03:58] those angels they went around the world
[1:04:00] too and smote the Nations blind
[1:04:03] with Christ dying on Calvary and Rising
[1:04:07] again and just saying that if you prayer
[1:04:09] Pray the Prayer of Salvation that you're
[1:04:11] going to be saved and all is going to be
[1:04:13] well and you can just carry on however
[1:04:14] you want it's not the case
[1:04:16] but it's not for everyone either
[1:04:19] we've been called to a special place and
[1:04:22] I just think it's wonderful to recognize
[1:04:23] our provided place of worship in our day
[1:04:26] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:04:28] forever it's not saying that we worship
[1:04:31] brother Branham we worship that that
[1:04:33] that light that was above Brother Brad
[1:04:35] and we worship the god that allowed
[1:04:37] himself to be captured in that picture
[1:04:39] one time we worship the god whose face
[1:04:42] we see if you look at it properly if you
[1:04:45] turn it right you see his face inside
[1:04:47] that cloud that's the God we worship the
[1:04:49] god that William Mary and Branham came
[1:04:51] and represented and said don't don't
[1:04:53] look at me look at him I must decrease
[1:04:55] so that he must increase that's the god
[1:04:58] that we worship
[1:05:00] tonight talking about our scripture I
[1:05:02] just think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:05:04] going back to our our study about
[1:05:06] husbands and wives we've got a few
[1:05:08] minutes left I apologize for taking so
[1:05:10] much time talking about that but you
[1:05:12] know in uh in verse one I just think
[1:05:13] it's so wonderful looking at this
[1:05:15] likewise out of First Peter chapter
[1:05:17] three likewise he wives be in subjection
[1:05:20] to your own husbands
[1:05:23] and you know that semicolon is there
[1:05:25] and the semicolon I just think it's
[1:05:27] interesting when you look at that
[1:05:28] there's no accidents with punctuation in
[1:05:31] the word of God there's no accidents
[1:05:33] with with capitals and and and with
[1:05:36] lower case it's all for a very specific
[1:05:38] purpose this the small punctuation mark
[1:05:41] the semicolon in grammatical terms
[1:05:44] represents a place where a sentence
[1:05:47] could end
[1:05:48] but it continues on
[1:05:51] likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[1:05:55] your own husbands
[1:05:56] that if any obey not the word
[1:06:00] that they
[1:06:01] Also may without
[1:06:04] the word
[1:06:05] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:06:09] meaning that the wives can actually do
[1:06:12] something for their husbands the wives
[1:06:14] have the ability even if their husbands
[1:06:16] aren't actually on the word even if
[1:06:18] their husbands are actually outside of
[1:06:19] their position even if the husbands I'll
[1:06:21] say it this way and I'll just say it
[1:06:24] this way even if the husbands are wrong
[1:06:27] because sometimes they are even if the
[1:06:29] husbands are wrong if that wife is
[1:06:31] willing to actually stay in her position
[1:06:33] and follow the word of God then what
[1:06:36] will happen is she can actually save her
[1:06:38] husband she can actually do something to
[1:06:41] prevent Calamity in their lives
[1:06:45] it's such a beautiful beautiful thought
[1:06:47] I just
[1:06:49] I just think it's amazing
[1:06:52] you know we will we could just read the
[1:06:54] scripture we'll just carry on with it
[1:06:56] there verse 2 says while they behold
[1:06:58] your Chase conversation coupled with
[1:07:00] fear while who beholds
[1:07:02] your Chase conversation coupled with
[1:07:04] fear
[1:07:06] yeah the husbands the family
[1:07:09] children
[1:07:10] everyone around that's one of the
[1:07:12] biggest things is the family
[1:07:13] conversations
[1:07:15] the family conversations we can say what
[1:07:17] we want when we're in public in front of
[1:07:19] everyone but the truth comes out
[1:07:20] children are honest children say what
[1:07:24] happens around the dinner table and you
[1:07:26] know we don't want to have different
[1:07:27] conversation around the dinner table and
[1:07:29] think well we've got our private
[1:07:30] sanctuary and we can just say whatever
[1:07:32] we want you know we believe the word of
[1:07:33] God but we could just say what we want
[1:07:34] you know there was a group of people
[1:07:36] that did that one time and a whole bunch
[1:07:38] of children lost their lives two she
[1:07:40] Bears came in from the prophet and
[1:07:42] brother Branham said it very clearly it
[1:07:44] was from their dinner time conversation
[1:07:45] from the way those parents talked about
[1:07:47] the prophet and the prophet's Ministry
[1:07:50] but it's that that that people who
[1:07:52] actually see that behavior in that wife
[1:07:55] and and I just think let's let's take it
[1:07:58] and zoom out maybe from the the natural
[1:08:00] spiritual let's just go spiritual and
[1:08:02] say the wife
[1:08:03] the wife the one who maybe thought that
[1:08:06] she could do something and and cause the
[1:08:09] word of God cause her husband's word to
[1:08:11] come to pass nope
[1:08:13] the chase conversation is you know what
[1:08:15] I just simply put myself in my position
[1:08:17] and I trust his word with all my heart
[1:08:19] and it's up to him he's obligated to
[1:08:21] only one thing not my behavior he's
[1:08:23] obligated to his word and his word is
[1:08:26] what will come to pass in due time if
[1:08:28] I'm willing to put that first in my life
[1:08:31] my Chase conversation can cause his word
[1:08:33] to come to pass it sounds like maybe I'm
[1:08:36] I'm saying one thing and and saying a
[1:08:38] total opposite thing I'm not I'm saying
[1:08:39] that the only thing that I can do as his
[1:08:42] bride is simply say it's his word and
[1:08:44] his word alone that's all humble myself
[1:08:46] to his word
[1:08:48] verse 3 who's adorning let it not be
[1:08:51] that outward adorning of plating of the
[1:08:53] hair and wearing of gold or putting on
[1:08:54] of apparel but not not doing something
[1:08:57] on our own not trying to muster
[1:08:59] something up and and make it happen we
[1:09:01] can't do that on our own it's got to be
[1:09:03] the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives it
[1:09:05] has to be him doing it it's got to be
[1:09:07] washed white not whitewashed right we
[1:09:11] need to make sure that it's not an
[1:09:13] outward adorning that's making us who we
[1:09:15] are it's actually the life that comes
[1:09:17] from when inside of us and and I don't
[1:09:19] even know if I have the quote here but
[1:09:20] you know Jesus said to his disciples
[1:09:22] it's not what actually goes into the man
[1:09:25] that defiles his body according to the
[1:09:27] law we know that it says it is right if
[1:09:29] they ate pork or they ate anything
[1:09:31] unclean according to the law for their
[1:09:33] day that's what defiled them but Jesus
[1:09:35] said it's what comes out of the mouth
[1:09:37] that defiles the man so we need to be
[1:09:40] careful what we speak
[1:09:42] talking about the third poll third pole
[1:09:45] people Book of Life people we've got the
[1:09:47] third pull in our midst we understand
[1:09:48] the power of the spoken word one day
[1:09:50] we're going to speak meals maybe restore
[1:09:52] limbs have all this stuff but but do we
[1:09:55] get ourselves caught up in the negative
[1:09:56] context of talking negative about things
[1:09:58] and speaking things that aren't
[1:10:01] according to his word it's that chase
[1:10:03] conversation brothers and sisters that's
[1:10:04] going to make things happen
[1:10:07] verse 4 says but let it be the hidden
[1:10:09] man of the heart
[1:10:10] I thought we were talking about wives
[1:10:12] here
[1:10:14] Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart
[1:10:16] in in that which is not corruptable even
[1:10:19] the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:10:22] which is in the sight of God a great
[1:10:24] price so we can say this this scripture
[1:10:26] has a compound meaning and revelation we
[1:10:27] can say sure enough it's talking about a
[1:10:29] wife that's the way I want my wife to be
[1:10:32] yeah
[1:10:34] she has the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:10:36] spirit
[1:10:38] which is in the sight of God a great
[1:10:40] price every husband wants their wife to
[1:10:42] be that way but what about us as his
[1:10:45] wife
[1:10:46] are we putting ourselves in that
[1:10:47] position because if we're not putting
[1:10:48] ourselves in that position that don't
[1:10:50] even bother talking about your wife like
[1:10:51] that I I don't know maybe I'm going too
[1:10:53] far by saying that but I just believe it
[1:10:55] with all my heart we have got to be the
[1:10:57] one setting the example
[1:10:59] in our homes
[1:11:01] and if we're not doing it talk us cheap
[1:11:03] brothers and sisters we've got to be the
[1:11:05] ones that are really setting the example
[1:11:07] how are our children ever going to learn
[1:11:10] the behavior that they need to follow
[1:11:12] according to the word of God if we're
[1:11:14] living something different
[1:11:17] it's got to be that hidden man of the
[1:11:19] heart the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ so how
[1:11:21] can we ever live the word of God we
[1:11:24] can't that's why people get so upset
[1:11:26] about the message of the hour you'll
[1:11:28] never be able to live it never
[1:11:30] but when that hidden man of the heart
[1:11:32] when he starts living out through your
[1:11:34] life you will start to actually live
[1:11:37] this word and you know it's going to be
[1:11:39] the life lived it's not going to be the
[1:11:41] sermon preached we can talk all we want
[1:11:43] but we've got to be able to live it and
[1:11:45] the only way we're going to live it is
[1:11:46] to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Bar
[1:11:48] None there's no action that we can do
[1:11:51] go on to verse 5 for after this manner
[1:11:53] in the old time the holy women who
[1:11:55] trusted in God adorned themselves being
[1:11:58] subjection unto their own husbands even
[1:12:00] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[1:12:02] whose daughters ye are
[1:12:06] he just goes in and out of it being
[1:12:08] spiritual and natural I just love it
[1:12:09] even Sarah or who obeyed Abraham calling
[1:12:13] him Lord whose daughters ye are as long
[1:12:15] as ye do well and are not afraid with
[1:12:18] any amazement don't be afraid of the
[1:12:19] word of God just let the word of God
[1:12:21] live out in your lives
[1:12:24] but then it goes into kind of what I
[1:12:26] wanted to get into tonight likewise ye
[1:12:28] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:12:30] knowledge giving honor to the wife as
[1:12:33] unto the weaker vessel and as being
[1:12:36] heirs together of that Grace of life
[1:12:39] that your prayers be not hindered
[1:12:43] we have talked about this in the past
[1:12:44] and how the husbands can sometimes say
[1:12:46] well she's the weaker vessel she was the
[1:12:48] one that was tempted she was the one
[1:12:49] that was deceived Adam wasn't uh the
[1:12:52] wife maybe my wife could be deceived but
[1:12:55] I can't I I would say this in in a lot
[1:12:58] of cases brothers and sisters some of
[1:12:59] the women are just a little sharper than
[1:13:02] some of the men and I'm not saying that
[1:13:04] in a way that that I mean it to be bad
[1:13:06] but I'm just saying women are not stupid
[1:13:09] women are not dumb women are very very
[1:13:12] smart and we need to honor them we need
[1:13:15] to give honor unto them we need to dwell
[1:13:17] with them according to knowledge and
[1:13:19] giving honor unto the wife
[1:13:23] as being the weaker vessel and
[1:13:25] recognizing that it was Eve that was
[1:13:27] deceived Adam went willingly
[1:13:29] understanding by knowledge by teaching
[1:13:32] how do we get knowledge
[1:13:34] we get knowledge by teaching we get
[1:13:36] knowledge by reading we get knowledge by
[1:13:38] hearing the word of God we need to know
[1:13:40] that the wife is the weaker vessel
[1:13:42] spiritually speaking I know people would
[1:13:44] maybe challenge me on that but that's
[1:13:46] why the husbands have to be the ones
[1:13:47] actually digging in and being the ones
[1:13:50] who are strong in in the word and making
[1:13:53] sure that they're fortifying their house
[1:13:54] fortifying their family we can't be
[1:13:57] bringing things into our homes and
[1:13:59] saying it's okay it's like in the olden
[1:14:01] days if we have a castle and we've got
[1:14:02] it fortified we've got all the gates and
[1:14:04] everything if the king were to bring in
[1:14:06] a bad guy and say it's okay you could
[1:14:08] just come into the castle and just be
[1:14:09] here with us you know you're friendly
[1:14:11] and I kind of like you the way you make
[1:14:12] me laugh and and all these different
[1:14:14] things maybe there's some fun stuff that
[1:14:16] he does you can just come in and dwell
[1:14:18] with us what's going to happen when that
[1:14:19] bad guy gets in the castle he's going to
[1:14:21] start finding out secrets and telling
[1:14:23] weak stories about weaknesses and he's
[1:14:25] going to send messages to his buddies
[1:14:27] and eventually he's going to start
[1:14:28] bringing friends into the castle as
[1:14:31] husbands as fathers we've got to be
[1:14:33] doing that four to five buying our homes
[1:14:34] with the word of God we can't bring
[1:14:37] worldly into our home and think that
[1:14:39] we're going to be spiritually strong
[1:14:41] we're going to be looking for a solution
[1:14:44] in the wrong way we'll we'll just be
[1:14:46] taking ourselves backwards
[1:14:48] we have to recognize that we are the
[1:14:50] ones We're The Gatekeepers the husbands
[1:14:52] are The Gatekeepers husbands dwell with
[1:14:54] them according to knowledge being
[1:14:56] smarter than this world smarter than the
[1:14:58] devil that's going to come around and
[1:14:59] maybe try and deceive our wives
[1:15:01] spiritually speaking giving honor unto
[1:15:04] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[1:15:06] being heirs together of the grace of
[1:15:09] life
[1:15:10] not just one
[1:15:12] not just the other but both heirs
[1:15:14] together of the grace of life that your
[1:15:18] prayers be not hindered
[1:15:21] I just think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:15:22] because what he's saying here is just
[1:15:24] get in your position get in your
[1:15:26] position spiritually and naturally when
[1:15:29] we're in our position we're going to see
[1:15:30] the lord of the Lord move in our lives
[1:15:32] then we'll see our prayers not hindered
[1:15:34] it's possible that our prayers are
[1:15:36] hindered though brothers and sisters
[1:15:37] because of the way he words this that
[1:15:40] your prayers be not hindered verse 8
[1:15:42] finally be all of One mind
[1:15:46] having compassion one of another
[1:15:51] love as Brethren be pitiful and
[1:15:53] courteous talking about the wife and the
[1:15:56] husband
[1:15:58] just being kind one to another and not
[1:16:01] having hurtful words I'm angry so I can
[1:16:04] just have hurtful words I can just speak
[1:16:05] Angry Words and it's going to be okay
[1:16:07] it's not going to be okay brothers and
[1:16:09] sisters it's not going to be okay it's
[1:16:11] not it's going to hurt and it can take a
[1:16:13] long time for the hurt to disappear
[1:16:15] we sow seeds with our mouth it's not
[1:16:18] what goes into the mouth remember that
[1:16:19] defiles a man it's what comes out
[1:16:22] but we need to be of one mind we're on
[1:16:24] the same teen having compassion one for
[1:16:27] another love his Brethren be pitiful and
[1:16:30] courteous if someone trips and falls be
[1:16:33] pitiful
[1:16:34] and be courteous and help them up
[1:16:37] if you see that they're going to trip
[1:16:38] and fall clear the path call out to them
[1:16:41] hey that's going to be bad don't go that
[1:16:43] way that's you're gonna you know we have
[1:16:45] the ability to do that and verse 9 I
[1:16:47] think is the most critical for all of
[1:16:49] this not rendering evil for evil this
[1:16:51] world says evil for evil and people some
[1:16:53] people would say well an eye for an eye
[1:16:54] right well that's the Old Testament law
[1:16:56] if you want to live under the law you're
[1:16:57] going to die under the law but if you
[1:16:59] want to live under grace the word that
[1:17:00] we're talking about tonight then you're
[1:17:01] going to be pitiful and you're going to
[1:17:03] be courteous we're going to behave that
[1:17:05] way according to the word not rendering
[1:17:06] evil for evil well you did this to me so
[1:17:08] I can do that to you or I never got this
[1:17:10] so you can't have that or or this or
[1:17:13] that all of that is is is
[1:17:16] I would say it's Child's Play if we're
[1:17:18] actually behaving like that in our homes
[1:17:19] in our marriage in our relationships you
[1:17:21] know we need to we we need to we need to
[1:17:24] read this word
[1:17:26] not rendering evil for evil or rallying
[1:17:29] railing for railing sorry not rallying
[1:17:31] but railing for railing
[1:17:34] the contrary wise blessing
[1:17:38] knowing that ye are there unto called
[1:17:41] that ye should inherit a blessing I'm
[1:17:43] I'm going to inherit a blessing so I
[1:17:46] don't want to render evil because maybe
[1:17:48] my wife renders evil to me
[1:17:51] I I want to
[1:17:53] bless her
[1:17:54] and I'm sorry I I'm not saying that she
[1:17:57] does but I think she looks after me in
[1:17:59] an incredible way and
[1:18:01] just to be honest since we've started
[1:18:03] talking about all of this husbands and
[1:18:05] wives our marriage has changed
[1:18:08] it's been tremendous and I think it's
[1:18:11] beautiful I just will be totally
[1:18:12] completely transparent with it all and I
[1:18:14] hope it's okay with everyone but I only
[1:18:16] ever want to be that way I never want to
[1:18:17] have anything hidden from anyone if if
[1:18:19] anybody feels like maybe there is but
[1:18:21] you know talking about all of this there
[1:18:23] was a time where I thought you know I
[1:18:24] understand that we need to have uh uh
[1:18:27] teaching solid teaching and
[1:18:28] encouragement about marriage and and
[1:18:30] positions in the home and everything and
[1:18:33] and I thought well we could probably get
[1:18:34] a good minister to come in I know a few
[1:18:36] that probably could bring a whole series
[1:18:38] and maybe have a seminar and a learning
[1:18:40] session and it might not be a bad idea
[1:18:42] to do that but I believe the Lord spoke
[1:18:44] to me and said what about you
[1:18:46] you can bring somebody in but if you
[1:18:48] can't talk about this if you don't know
[1:18:50] this then it's not going to do any good
[1:18:52] to bring somebody else in
[1:18:54] so that's where I was humbled and I
[1:18:56] thought boy it's time for me to actually
[1:18:58] dig in and do some learning and I truly
[1:19:00] have it's been wonderful and and what
[1:19:03] it's done is allowed me to get into my
[1:19:04] position a little better and in doing so
[1:19:06] it causes everyone to fall in line with
[1:19:10] the word
[1:19:11] it's not actually saying that you need
[1:19:13] to get in line with the word to anyone
[1:19:15] in the home
[1:19:17] as a husband we're the trendsetter We're
[1:19:20] The Gatekeepers we're the ones that
[1:19:22] actually set excuse me we set the
[1:19:24] example for this
[1:19:26] verse 10 says for he that will love life
[1:19:29] and see good days let him refrain his
[1:19:33] tongue from evil and his lips that they
[1:19:37] speak no guile
[1:19:39] it's not what goes in
[1:19:41] it's what comes out verse 11 says let
[1:19:44] him issue evil and do good let him seek
[1:19:49] peace and ensue it let them find peace
[1:19:53] and and when maybe we start to get upset
[1:19:56] we do something different about it I I
[1:19:59] found a quote in in in the in the
[1:20:02] message when I was down there and I
[1:20:03] thought it was so interesting about you
[1:20:06] know just Birds Brother Brad I'm talking
[1:20:08] about the Robin and how the robin
[1:20:10] they probably look at humans and they
[1:20:12] say I wonder
[1:20:14] I don't know how brother Branham says it
[1:20:16] exactly I'll just paraphrase it quickly
[1:20:17] for time's sake but brother Branham says
[1:20:19] he talks about the robins and how they
[1:20:21] consider human beings and and how the
[1:20:23] human beings they get high blood
[1:20:25] pressure and he says I bet you never one
[1:20:26] want not not one Robin has ever had to
[1:20:29] go to the hospital for high blood
[1:20:31] pressure not one Robin has ever died of
[1:20:33] a heart attack because of a temper not
[1:20:35] one Robin has ever had an issue in their
[1:20:38] lives according to what the human
[1:20:39] condition is but here these humans they
[1:20:42] suffer from all of this and you know
[1:20:44] what it is it's a distraction the devil
[1:20:46] wants to just get us distracted if he
[1:20:48] can do it then we're going to actually
[1:20:50] have words that come out of our mouths
[1:20:51] they're going to cause problems and
[1:20:53] those problems are going to give the
[1:20:54] devil a day off and and all we're going
[1:20:57] to do is be going in circles running on
[1:20:59] our hamster wheel and we don't have to
[1:21:01] do that we can just focus on this word
[1:21:03] let us issue evil just like job we know
[1:21:06] that he was upright in the sight of God
[1:21:07] he he was fine in all of his ways and he
[1:21:10] he was a man who issued evil if he saw
[1:21:13] Evil coming his way he did everything he
[1:21:16] could to get out of the way so he could
[1:21:18] go around it
[1:21:20] brother Brown I'm in the church age book
[1:21:21] talking about
[1:21:23] the knowledge
[1:21:25] the word Smyrna out of the Sumerian
[1:21:28] Church age it means bitter
[1:21:30] being derived from the word myrrh
[1:21:33] myrrh was used in embalming the Dead
[1:21:36] thus we have a two-fold significance
[1:21:38] found in the name of this age it was a
[1:21:40] an IT twofold significance found in the
[1:21:44] name of this age it was a bitter age
[1:21:46] filled with death
[1:21:48] two Vines within the framework of the
[1:21:52] church
[1:21:52] we're drifting further apart with an
[1:21:56] increased bitterness toward the True
[1:21:58] Vine on the part of the false
[1:22:01] I just can't help but think you know
[1:22:02] brother Bradham says it very clearly he
[1:22:04] says that when the bride
[1:22:06] starts to declare the wheat starts to
[1:22:09] declare I and my father are one
[1:22:12] then the shuck will start to pull away
[1:22:15] the wheat's not going to pull away but
[1:22:16] the shock's gonna start saying now there
[1:22:18] you go making yourself God again but
[1:22:20] don't don't you realize that I know all
[1:22:22] your faults and failures I can see your
[1:22:23] flesh and I can see your parents and I
[1:22:25] know your lineage I know all about you
[1:22:27] but you go and make yourself God one of
[1:22:29] these days brothers and sisters the
[1:22:31] Rapture is going to go
[1:22:33] it's gonna happen
[1:22:34] brother Bradham says out of this quote
[1:22:36] here the two Vines within the framework
[1:22:37] of the church were drifting further
[1:22:39] apart with an increased bitterness
[1:22:41] toward the True Vine on the part of the
[1:22:44] false
[1:22:45] death was not only the seed of the false
[1:22:49] Vine
[1:22:50] but even in the True Vine there was a
[1:22:53] creeping paralysis and impotence because
[1:22:58] they had already drifted from the
[1:23:00] unadulterated truth of the first few
[1:23:04] years after Pentecost
[1:23:07] brother Branham says
[1:23:09] and no True Believer is any stronger and
[1:23:13] spiritually healthy and alive
[1:23:17] then his knowledge of
[1:23:19] and adherence to
[1:23:22] the pure word of God
[1:23:24] what's the pure word of God in our day
[1:23:27] brothers and sisters it's the message of
[1:23:29] the hour
[1:23:31] it's understanding this knowing that our
[1:23:34] knowledge of it and adherence to it is
[1:23:38] what will make the difference in our
[1:23:39] lives and when we read this scripture
[1:23:42] here where if if we deal with our wives
[1:23:46] according to knowledge how are we going
[1:23:49] to deal with our wives I think this just
[1:23:51] takes it to a whole new level we're not
[1:23:52] talking about dealing with our wives
[1:23:54] according to the knowledge we're going
[1:23:56] to pick up from from reading books from
[1:23:58] the library and and maybe study
[1:24:00] materials we might get in University
[1:24:01] anything outside of the message of the
[1:24:04] hour brothers and sisters anything
[1:24:06] outside of the message of the hour
[1:24:09] brothers and sisters is the tree of
[1:24:12] knowledge of Good and Evil this is from
[1:24:15] Satan anything in the message of the
[1:24:17] hour is going to be of the word this is
[1:24:20] the knowledge that we're talking about
[1:24:22] when we read this scripture verse 7 we
[1:24:24] can say there's a psychological aspect
[1:24:26] and there is there's things that we deal
[1:24:28] with in our bodies and there are there's
[1:24:30] different chem buckles that get released
[1:24:32] and they happen but you know what the
[1:24:34] only thing that's going to Deliver Us
[1:24:35] from them all is the word of God that's
[1:24:39] the only thing
[1:24:40] no True Believer is any stronger and
[1:24:42] spiritually healthy and Alive than his
[1:24:45] knowledge of an adherence to the pure
[1:24:47] word of God as seen by multitudes of
[1:24:50] examples in the Old Testament
[1:24:52] organization was growing a pace
[1:24:55] confirming and augmenting the death of
[1:24:58] the membership for the Holy Ghost
[1:25:01] leadership was deposed and the Word was
[1:25:04] replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made
[1:25:09] ritual and I just want to say tonight
[1:25:11] brothers and sisters if we've got a list
[1:25:13] of do's and don'ts that we think we
[1:25:14] should or shouldn't do and that's what's
[1:25:16] holding us together that's what's
[1:25:18] keeping us going with the word of God
[1:25:19] maybe just take a step backwards and ask
[1:25:22] God to fill you with his holy spirit
[1:25:24] because if we're looking at do's and
[1:25:26] don'ts we've actually I want to say this
[1:25:27] and maybe we'll have a discussion about
[1:25:29] it I like it we should if we're doing
[1:25:31] do's and don'ts brothers and sisters I
[1:25:33] truly believe with all my heart we don't
[1:25:34] have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because
[1:25:36] if we've got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:25:38] we're just going to be at rest we're
[1:25:40] just going to know that God's going to
[1:25:41] work it all out for his glory you know
[1:25:43] if you want to challenge that let's take
[1:25:45] a look at the the woman who was taken
[1:25:47] and thrown at Jesus feet she was caught
[1:25:49] in the act of adultery if you want to
[1:25:51] talk about works she should have been
[1:25:54] taken out and stoned but I heard
[1:25:55] somebody say it recently they took her
[1:25:57] to the wrong man was it your brother
[1:25:59] that said that they brought her to the
[1:26:00] wrong man they brought her to Grace
[1:26:03] they didn't realize it but he was there
[1:26:06] to atone for all of that sin for all of
[1:26:09] that natural ability you know the only
[1:26:11] thing that God wants he wants our spirit
[1:26:14] he wants our soul he wants all of us
[1:26:17] except for one thing
[1:26:20] and that's our natural ability he
[1:26:21] doesn't want anything to do with our
[1:26:22] natural ability if we've got a natural
[1:26:24] ability he wants to take us take it and
[1:26:26] throw it away because he can't use us
[1:26:27] for his glory and that was one of the
[1:26:29] things they brought out about Ministry
[1:26:30] if we're going to preach the gospel he
[1:26:32] doesn't want any of us he doesn't want
[1:26:34] our natural ability our natural ability
[1:26:36] is going to get in the way of the word
[1:26:37] of God
[1:26:41] but all of this the Holy Ghost
[1:26:42] leadership was deposed
[1:26:45] put aside just dismissed you know what
[1:26:47] they're just a little bit fundamental
[1:26:48] we're getting a little bit too loud in
[1:26:50] the service we need to just push aside
[1:26:52] the Holy Ghost leadership and actually
[1:26:55] replace it with what we had you know
[1:26:57] what this one time we we had service and
[1:27:00] and it was so good and it was just this
[1:27:02] way and it can be anything that happens
[1:27:04] it can be really louder it can be really
[1:27:06] quiet but if we saw the Lord God move in
[1:27:08] that moment and we said you know what we
[1:27:10] need to just replicate that we need to
[1:27:12] sing the same song we need to play the
[1:27:15] same way we need to do it just this way
[1:27:17] when we start to get our man-made ideas
[1:27:19] in there brothers and sisters we're
[1:27:20] limiting God we're grounding out the
[1:27:22] power that Dynamic power of the Lord
[1:27:24] Jesus Christ from moving in our midst we
[1:27:26] don't want to depose the Holy Ghost
[1:27:28] leadership in our lives we want to loose
[1:27:30] the Holy Ghost leadership in our lives
[1:27:32] We Want To Make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:27:35] Lord we're not interested in Creed's
[1:27:37] dogmas or man-made rituals we want to
[1:27:40] see the liberty of the Holy Ghost live
[1:27:42] in our our services live in our homes
[1:27:44] live in our families we want to see the
[1:27:46] Lord Jesus Christ in our lives
[1:27:49] I've been looking at the the book of
[1:27:51] Jeremiah and the the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:27:53] and what he had to go through it's a
[1:27:55] tremendous story but to know I just was
[1:27:57] so so so shocked when I saw this there's
[1:28:01] there's a bunch of scriptures in
[1:28:03] Jeremiah where he talks about pastors
[1:28:05] specifically and every one of them he
[1:28:07] talks about how the children of Israel
[1:28:09] had fallen away they'd they'd deposed
[1:28:11] the spirit the Holy Ghost spirit in
[1:28:13] their day now just bear with me I know
[1:28:15] the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given but he's
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:28:18] and forever and Jehovah of the old is
[1:28:20] Jesus of the new is the Holy Ghost in
[1:28:22] you we know that we're talking about
[1:28:24] Elohim that self-existing one and the
[1:28:26] way that he chose to express himself and
[1:28:28] and their way their day was the word
[1:28:30] they were given according to the law but
[1:28:32] they had set aside all of that and
[1:28:34] decided to do their own thing and
[1:28:36] Jeremiah was called out and told to go
[1:28:38] and tell these people you know what
[1:28:39] unless you're willing to repent and get
[1:28:41] back to that true word that original
[1:28:43] direction that God has given you are
[1:28:45] going to be destroyed and he cried out
[1:28:48] and cried out and cried out it's just
[1:28:49] the sort of the the cause notes version
[1:28:51] of it but eight times pastors are
[1:28:54] mentioned in the book of Jeremiah I
[1:28:55] believe maybe at seven and one is in
[1:28:57] Ephesians but this six of them in
[1:29:00] Jeremiah are crying out you're wrong you
[1:29:02] need to get back to the word but only
[1:29:04] one of them says and I will give you
[1:29:06] pastors according to Mine Heart
[1:29:09] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[1:29:12] understanding there's a purpose for
[1:29:15] having a five-fold Ministry there's a
[1:29:17] purpose for having a pastor and a church
[1:29:19] that you call your own if you don't have
[1:29:21] that brothers and sisters how are you
[1:29:23] going to find that knowledge and gain
[1:29:25] that understanding
[1:29:27] what you're doing is deposing the Holy
[1:29:29] Spirit and saying I want to create a
[1:29:31] Dogma or some other way some tradition
[1:29:34] that I think is going to work for me
[1:29:37] but it won't work it won't work brother
[1:29:40] Branham says I am the word
[1:29:43] if you want deity in your midst then
[1:29:46] welcome and receive the word
[1:29:49] I just think this this brings it down
[1:29:51] right home to where we live maybe just
[1:29:54] just to me where I live but don't don't
[1:29:57] if you want deity in your midst then
[1:29:58] welcome and receive the word and I'll
[1:30:02] say it this way welcome and receive the
[1:30:03] message of the hour welcome and receive
[1:30:06] it and what will happen is you'll
[1:30:07] welcome and receive the holy ghost in
[1:30:09] your life if you follow this message of
[1:30:10] the hour but if you want deity in your
[1:30:12] midst then welcome and receive the word
[1:30:14] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[1:30:18] between you and that word
[1:30:24] I just think it's beautiful it's
[1:30:26] tremendous this which I am giving you
[1:30:29] brother Branham has in Brackets the word
[1:30:32] is a revelation of myself
[1:30:34] now I said that in in such a way that
[1:30:36] sounded like it was brother Branham but
[1:30:38] it's not brother Branham it's Jesus
[1:30:40] Christ the word in Brackets is a
[1:30:42] revelation of myself I am the word
[1:30:46] remember that
[1:30:49] the church age book here
[1:30:52] you know there's a part of it where
[1:30:54] brother Brown was told to pick up his
[1:30:55] pen and write I'm not going to read that
[1:30:56] tonight but just to sort of verify who
[1:30:58] is talking when we read this stuff when
[1:31:00] we read quotes when we talk about the
[1:31:02] message of the hour who is talking it's
[1:31:04] not just a man it's not just William
[1:31:06] Mary and Branham it's not just a message
[1:31:08] it's Jesus Christ expressing himself in
[1:31:11] word form in in life in living people in
[1:31:14] the ministry for the people in their day
[1:31:16] brother Branham goes on to say I wonder
[1:31:18] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[1:31:21] the word in our midst
[1:31:24] I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:31:26] with the word in our midst if we're
[1:31:28] looking for a Creed or a Dogma Lord help
[1:31:30] us don't ever let it be found in our
[1:31:32] midst here not not in our camp as long
[1:31:35] as I'm around if there's a Creed or a
[1:31:36] Dogma we need to get rid of it the only
[1:31:38] Creator the only Dogma that I would want
[1:31:40] to see is that Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:42] yesterday today and forever would be
[1:31:44] alive and well in every one of our lives
[1:31:46] and every one of our hearts and if
[1:31:48] anybody ever needs more of him there's
[1:31:50] more of him to be had the only thing we
[1:31:52] need to do is just ask for him just
[1:31:54] invite him and and he will come and and
[1:31:57] the Beautiful part about it brothers and
[1:31:58] sisters is we are just a little group
[1:32:00] and we're talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:32:02] Christ and and we have these great
[1:32:04] evangelists that have gone around and
[1:32:05] around the world and talk to millions of
[1:32:07] people and change the hearts and
[1:32:09] millions of people
[1:32:10] but they will never be able to receive
[1:32:12] the word that we receive that we have
[1:32:14] the ability to hear and to receive
[1:32:17] it's it's just a tremendous thought
[1:32:19] tonight I just can't I just can't even
[1:32:21] express the the feeling of of of
[1:32:25] overwhelming joy to recognize what we
[1:32:27] have in our midst we have got such a
[1:32:30] tremendous opportunity brothers and
[1:32:31] sisters and that opportunity is just to
[1:32:33] encourage that word in one another
[1:32:35] encourage that word in our homes and you
[1:32:39] know if I have said anything that really
[1:32:41] has upset anyone I'm certainly open to
[1:32:43] discussion I really don't ever want to
[1:32:44] do that I just want to encourage us for
[1:32:46] a closer walk with Christ because that's
[1:32:48] the only thing that's going to help us
[1:32:49] in our homes that's the only thing
[1:32:50] that's going to help us in our our our
[1:32:52] school and our business and everything
[1:32:54] that we conduct ourselves in because
[1:32:56] really what it comes down to is it's not
[1:32:58] what we do it's not what comes out of
[1:33:00] out of out of our actions in our lives
[1:33:03] it's what comes out of our mouths that's
[1:33:05] what's going to make the difference and
[1:33:06] if we can have the confession of the
[1:33:09] word if we can have that chaste
[1:33:11] conversation I believe that we have the
[1:33:13] opportunity to see the Lord move in a
[1:33:15] great way
[1:33:16] I'm not interested in pushing us back to
[1:33:18] Pentecost I just want to say this that
[1:33:20] penny cost was an experience it wasn't a
[1:33:23] denomination
[1:33:24] and when that experience happens in our
[1:33:26] lives brothers and sisters you can't
[1:33:28] hardly contain it you can't hardly
[1:33:30] contain it when the spirit of Christ
[1:33:31] comes on the scene you have a reason to
[1:33:34] shout you have a reason to move and I've
[1:33:36] said it before in the past I'll keep
[1:33:37] saying it as long as we're here we have
[1:33:39] every right to worship God according to
[1:33:42] the Revelation that he's given us in in
[1:33:44] this building here that's why this
[1:33:46] building is here it's not so that we can
[1:33:48] come here and and see Jesus Christ if
[1:33:50] you come to this building looking for
[1:33:51] Jesus Christ we're missing it we bring
[1:33:53] Jesus Christ with us that's why we need
[1:33:55] to come prayed up that's why we need to
[1:33:57] come maybe a few minutes early so that
[1:33:59] we can clean out all the things in our
[1:34:00] lives but the reason we come to this
[1:34:02] building is so that we can shout so loud
[1:34:04] that the people outside can potentially
[1:34:06] hear us that's what this building has
[1:34:08] created for a place that we can worship
[1:34:09] God in spirit and in truth without fear
[1:34:12] and not have to worry this is the place
[1:34:15] where we can let off the pressure where
[1:34:17] we can actually really give him the
[1:34:19] praise and the glory that he desires
[1:34:22] so if you ever want to shout don't be
[1:34:24] shy
[1:34:26] do you ever want to
[1:34:27] just give God praise don't don't be
[1:34:29] bashful this is the place to do it if
[1:34:31] there was ever a place brothers and
[1:34:32] sisters this is it right here I'm not
[1:34:35] trying to pull you you just do what the
[1:34:37] Lord leads you to do but if someone gets
[1:34:39] excited don't don't don't don't don't
[1:34:40] don't don't don't get worried about it
[1:34:42] just trust the Lord because this is like
[1:34:45] I said brothers and sisters this this is
[1:34:47] not an environment where devils like to
[1:34:49] be they don't like to be where the Lord
[1:34:51] Jesus Christ is and when we come into a
[1:34:54] place like this and we start worshiping
[1:34:55] God the Devils want to try and get in
[1:34:57] the way they're gonna they're gonna say
[1:34:59] no you got that problem remember your
[1:35:00] arm is sore you can't lift it to God or
[1:35:02] maybe your voice is sore and if you sing
[1:35:04] too loud you're not going to be able to
[1:35:05] talk on Monday and all these different
[1:35:07] reasons and things are going to come
[1:35:09] your way and it's just going to be to
[1:35:11] hinder you from worshiping but when you
[1:35:13] see that thing when you hear that thing
[1:35:14] and when you actually say I know my arm
[1:35:16] is going to hurt if I lift it and and
[1:35:18] give God the praise and the glory but
[1:35:20] when you do that when you push Beyond it
[1:35:22] when brother Branham he says it do the
[1:35:24] opposite when you have a feeling when
[1:35:26] you start doing that brothers and
[1:35:27] sisters all those Devils fall off your
[1:35:29] arms because they're grabbing onto your
[1:35:30] arms and they're pulling your arm down
[1:35:32] real hard to keep you from worshiping
[1:35:34] because your man better upset or your
[1:35:36] arm is sore whatever it is push through
[1:35:38] and actually go forwards and watch the
[1:35:41] Lord Watch What Happens watch and see if
[1:35:44] the Lord doesn't receive your worship
[1:35:46] push those Devils out
[1:35:48] I'm going to ask you to stand tonight I
[1:35:50] won't keep you any longer we'll invite
[1:35:52] the musicians brother Branham he he said
[1:35:54] it I I I'm wondering if we're
[1:35:57] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:35:59] and I I just wonder brothers and sisters
[1:36:01] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[1:36:03] the word if we are sufficiently
[1:36:05] impressed with the word then we've got
[1:36:06] every single reason in our lives to
[1:36:08] rejoice
[1:36:09] to sing Glory unto the Lord because we
[1:36:12] know what he's done for us we know what
[1:36:14] this word is we know it's the pearl of
[1:36:16] great price and and we know that story
[1:36:19] about the man when he found that pearl
[1:36:21] of great price he gave it all away
[1:36:23] everything that he had he had no desire
[1:36:25] for it anymore there was no need to hang
[1:36:27] on to anything because he found that
[1:36:29] pearl of great price when we find this
[1:36:31] word for our our lives and our families
[1:36:33] and our homes boy oh boy there's nothing
[1:36:36] that's going to hold us back from it
[1:36:38] you love them tonight
[1:36:41] let's just go to him in prayer gracious
[1:36:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:36:45] goodness to us Lord
[1:36:48] thank you Father that you would give
[1:36:50] unto us pastors Lord that would that
[1:36:52] would lead us according to knowledge
[1:36:54] father

[1:36:58] and and guide us the direction that we
[1:37:00] need to go father I want to thank you
[1:37:03] for a pastor that took me and and led me

[1:37:15] house tonight and father I pray that you

[1:37:36] of the world to fill the positions that
[1:37:37] they're in Lord all of the Evangelist
[1:37:40] Lord Jesus all of the teachers father
[1:37:42] Lord what an amazing thing it is to
[1:37:45] stand for you in this age Lord in this
[1:37:48] age of confusion Lord this age where all
[1:37:51] of the lines in the world are blurred
[1:37:53] father every country we know now is
[1:37:55] affected by the Sodom condition Lord
[1:37:58] whether it's it's by social media
[1:38:00] creeping in or whether it's by the
[1:38:02] changing of the laws we know that no
[1:38:04] country is exempt from all of that but
[1:38:07] we also know that every single country
[1:38:09] in this world has heard about the
[1:38:12] message of the hour father Lord Jesus we
[1:38:15] know that while the enemy comes in like
[1:38:17] a flood you have designed Lord Jesus a
[1:38:20] bride that will be raised as a standard
[1:38:23] above that flood of the enemy father and
[1:38:26] we know that that is your bride Lord and
[1:38:28] I pray that tonight father not as Noah
[1:38:31] pitched with with pitch father tonight I
[1:38:33] pray that we could pitch ourselves with
[1:38:35] your spirit Lord Jesus father that we

[1:38:40] fanaticism every single sinful nature

[1:38:47] that Lord and just see you father Lord I

[1:38:52] one another husbands and wives children
[1:38:54] and parents father brothers and sisters

[1:39:04] Jesus Christ that we would be able to
[1:39:06] turn the picture of each one of us Lord

[1:39:11] you father Lord that we wouldn't be
[1:39:13] stumbling at the veil father help us if

[1:39:20] give us other just a fresh filling of
[1:39:24] your spirit Lord where we have kindness
[1:39:27] Lord and compassion and Tender Mercies

[1:39:32] for each one of us Lord father we know
[1:39:34] that your Prophet was was in that
[1:39:36] position where he was in that Diner Lord
[1:39:39] and he saw that vision of the sinful
[1:39:42] people in that Diner and he saw oh
[1:39:45] father he saw your face and he saw the
[1:39:48] the sins hitting your face and and he
[1:39:50] said are those sins those sins of those
[1:39:51] sinful people and you said no they're
[1:39:54] your sins as the prophet they're your
[1:39:56] sins hitting my face how much more do I
[1:39:59] protect those people father I pray that
[1:40:02] we would have the desire to recognize
[1:40:04] our position and outside of you and your
[1:40:06] protection that bumper of blood that you
[1:40:08] provided Lord oh Father every one of us
[1:40:11] would be doomed
[1:40:12] father tonight I pray that you would
[1:40:14] just be glorified in all that we say and
[1:40:16] do as we go forwards Lord that we would
[1:40:18] consider the magnitude that we would
[1:40:20] consider the gravity of having your Holy
[1:40:23] Spirit in us oh Father not just with us
[1:40:25] and not just come and have a good
[1:40:27] anointed service Lord but that we could
[1:40:30] bring you to each service and take you
[1:40:32] with each service and take you to our
[1:40:33] homes and take you to our work and take
[1:40:35] you to our school and take you to our
[1:40:37] private places Lord where we can just be
[1:40:40] ourselves and father change our our
[1:40:42] Natures Lord change our very Natures
[1:40:44] where we would desire to look at that
[1:40:46] thing that that desire would just fall
[1:40:48] away father when we desire to say a
[1:40:50] certain thing but that desire would
[1:40:52] change and we would just have compassion
[1:40:54] one for another
[1:40:55] father we just ask that you would go
[1:40:58] with us now as we go our separate ways
[1:40:59] father we love you and we thank you and
[1:41:01] father we could never give you enough
[1:41:03] praise and glory and honor for what
[1:41:05] you've done for us in this day Lord to
[1:41:07] know that you have a Lamb's Book of Life
[1:41:09] and you have a book of life and father
[1:41:11] some people were placed on the Lamb's
[1:41:13] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:41:15] the world
[1:41:16] and father there's nothing they could do
[1:41:17] to put their name there take it off
