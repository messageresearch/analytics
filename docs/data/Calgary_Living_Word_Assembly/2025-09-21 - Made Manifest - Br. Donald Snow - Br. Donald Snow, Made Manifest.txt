========================================

Poems called made manifest. Creation waits with groaning voice. The earth in birth pain cries for suns to rise with spoken word and open blinded eyes. Not future hope but present hour. The bride takes up her stand. With perfect word and spirit fool, she rules at his command. Hear the testimonies of the end time hour where mystery meets the plane where sons of God arise in strength and Christ is seen again. No longer shadows, types or hints, no fragments left to find. The perfect word, the spirit's flame, &gt;&gt; hath come to claim mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They do not walk in borrowed light, nor live by serpent's design. The fullness of the spoken word now pulses through their spine. The seed of God within their soul ignite it with holy fire. Not just the longing of the heart, but power to fulfill desire. Each morning when the sun peaks up and breaks the night's retreat, the children of God awake in faith and stand upon their feet. They seized the flesh, this stubborn man, &gt;&gt; and cast him to the floor. &gt;&gt; Submit, O body, to the word, and serve the Lord once more. &gt;&gt; This power is not from mortal flame, nor courage of the brave. It's by the spirit of the lamb who left an empty grave. The very Christ now living in flesh. The mystery long concealed unveiled in sons and daughters here in Calgary. &gt;&gt; In Calgary, &gt;&gt; his glory now revealed. &gt;&gt; No chain of lust, no fear of death, no unbelief can remain. &gt;&gt; For liberty has crowned their walk and circumcised Satan's shame. They tread this world with pre-ordained steps. Their hearts the temple bright, their very bodies testifying of God's eternal light. Hear the prophesying, oh saints of God. &gt;&gt; The prophecy come true. The same great life that conquered sin &gt;&gt; is now living in you. &gt;&gt; Not just the wish, but ability to act. The victory's already won. The glorious body made manifest. today, united with the sun. This is really what I want to remind you. As you walk these blackened streets and labor through the darkest of days, you carry heaven in your steps, the word your staff and stay. For now the bride is one with him, the mystery complete, the throne of God was in your soul, and the world beneath your feet. Lord bless you all. [Applause]
