[34:42] Revelations 2 verse
[34:45] 12 and to the angel of the church in
[34:47] pergamus write these things saith he
[34:51] which hath the sharp sword with two
[34:54] edges I Know Thy works and where thou DW
[34:57] dwellest even where Satan's seat is and
[35:01] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[35:04] denied my faith even in those days where
[35:08] in antip pass was my faithful martyr who
[35:12] was slain among you where Satan
[35:15] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[35:17] thee because thou Hast there them that
[35:22] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[35:26] baac to cast a stumbling block before
[35:30] the children of Israel to eat things
[35:32] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[35:36] fornication so hast thou also them that
[35:40] hold the doctrine of the
[35:42] Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or
[35:47] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[35:50] will fight against them with the sword
[35:52] of my
[35:53] mouth he that hath an ear let him hear

[36:10] a new name written which no man knoweth
[36:13] saving he that receiveth it let's just
[36:17] bow one more time Heavenly Father we
[36:20] just ask that Lord Jesus you would
[36:24] reveal Lord our names to us Lord yes
[36:27] Lord father that we would not see
[36:29] ourselves according to our first birth
[36:31] here but Lord that we would get to know
[36:33] ourselves according to the second birth
[36:36] because we know that's the only thing
[36:38] that's going to help us in the day in
[36:40] which we live we love you we thank you
[36:42] we just commit all these words into your
[36:45] hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's

[37:44] service God bless you tonight are you
[37:48] happy certainly wonderful weather
[37:50] outside I love the the warmth and the
[37:55] the sunshine that we're feeling and all
[37:56] the birds are back it's a tremendous
[37:59] time of the year here life that we have
[38:03] to to enjoy after a a winter the cold
[38:08] dead winter here anybody had struggles
[38:11] this
[38:13] week I uh I don't know but I know myself
[38:16] I have it's been uh interesting and it's
[38:19] only been a couple days since we had
[38:21] service but the Devil he's not bashful
[38:24] and he loves to try and upset people and
[38:29] uh I just was I just was meditating on
[38:32] uh you know why we must be born again
[38:34] there's a few messages that brother
[38:36] Brandon preaches and uh another one is
[38:39] ye must be born again and and you know
[38:42] that's the critical factor is we just
[38:44] have to be born again we just need to
[38:45] have a new birth and outside of a new
[38:47] birth all the mysteries of the message
[38:49] are irrelevant it's all head knowledge
[38:52] it's going to do us no good we can talk
[38:53] about all the Deep things all we want
[38:55] but it's not going to change our body
[38:57] the only only thing that will change our
[38:58] body is the token and that's the life
[39:00] the literal life of Jesus Christ and
[39:02] that's what's demanded of our day today
[39:04] it's not just coming to church and
[39:06] having Association and being a member
[39:09] actively in an assembly that's not going
[39:10] to do it the only thing that will do it
[39:13] is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[39:15] that's the requirement for the seventh
[39:17] Church age all of the combination of
[39:21] every single other age culminates with
[39:24] this one thing the literal life of Jesus
[39:27] Christ because we know that he came
[39:31] Jesus came sunset Mountain happened a
[39:34] sword was placed back into the hand of
[39:36] man again amen it's not a closed book
[39:39] it's an open booken and we have the
[39:41] opportunity to do something with that
[39:43] book but we know the devil knows all of
[39:47] this and just doesn't believe that we
[39:49] are the ones he believes the word and
[39:52] trembles all of his minions believe the
[39:55] word and tremble but they just don't
[39:58] believe that it could be us and the
[40:00] worst thing that we have to contend with
[40:02] is to think could it could it really be
[40:04] us could could it be me I want to say
[40:07] tonight yes you not some other time not
[40:11] some other place every single human
[40:13] being has the opportunity to come but
[40:15] not every single human being has that
[40:17] seed Gene of God down on the inside of
[40:20] the inside to Quicken when this word of
[40:23] the seventh angel messenger comes upon
[40:25] that seed amen I just had a quote I
[40:28] wanted to bring tonight talking about
[40:29] struggles and and it's out of ye must be
[40:31] born
[40:33] again brother bradam did I send this to
[40:35] you I think I did it was kind of a last
[40:39] minute thing but
[40:42] um I think I actually gave you to the
[40:44] paragraph I'm thinking of one I want to
[40:46] go back one paragraph brother Bram he
[40:48] says Satan is such a cunning
[40:52] enemy he just so moves in so sin is so
[40:57] so what would I say it's so shrewd rude
[41:02] you know it's just
[41:05] cunning just kind of subtle that's the
[41:09] word subtle just so subtle that it just
[41:13] move right in so easy you know it looks
[41:17] just so
[41:18] innocent the first thing you know we
[41:21] just got like a spider web a spider with
[41:24] a web got you there you go he
[41:28] says and we know the more you struggle
[41:30] in a spiderweb when you see a a creature
[41:32] in a spiderweb the more they struggle
[41:34] the more Tangled they get the more
[41:35] Tangled they get the more trapped they
[41:37] are and you can't get out of
[41:39] it brother bandam goes on to say I'm
[41:41] thinking of one thing that's the end of
[41:44] the
[41:45] road which is perhaps not too far off
[41:48] for me I'm not a boy no more and I've
[41:50] got to think of then meeting all the
[41:54] people again my friend was telling me
[41:56] one time they was given a prize and I
[41:59] want this to go real down deep to every
[42:03] one of us one of those little things
[42:05] that he's saying just pause and and
[42:07] consider this think about this it just
[42:10] spoke to me we can get so hung up in our
[42:13] moments of Life can't we the devil wants
[42:16] us to get hung up in our moments of life
[42:18] he wants to pull out the magnifying
[42:19] glass and get right into detail with our
[42:22] lives and especially for us to go into
[42:24] detail with other people's lives and
[42:26] their Det details but brother Bram he
[42:28] says in Vancouver British Columbia they
[42:31] were given a prize for a boy that could
[42:33] ride a bicycle 12 in across for a 100
[42:36] yards they'd give him a new Schwin
[42:39] bicycle we're all familiar with this
[42:40] story I just thought you know I'm going
[42:42] to read it and all the boys they thought
[42:45] they were fine Riders they'd go downtown
[42:49] for their mama get a basket of groceries
[42:51] and put it under their arm and ride back
[42:53] and never even touch the
[42:55] handlebars so each one knew he was going
[42:57] to win the
[42:59] contest they had a little old boy
[43:02] there that just you know mama's boy like
[43:06] and I I I know brother brandham is doing
[43:08] this description he's describing it and
[43:09] I just can't help but think that this is
[43:11] probably the type of individual that's
[43:13] maybe just a little bit of an oddball
[43:15] just doesn't fit in with everyone else
[43:17] doesn't doesn't want to do all the
[43:19] things that all the other people do and
[43:21] and go to all the places the other
[43:23] people go to just a little bit like
[43:25] brother bam would say a little bit of a
[43:26] boy there that that just you know
[43:28] mama's boy likee and and and none of
[43:30] them cared very much for him so they all
[43:34] got on their their time as their numbers
[43:37] were called they got on this board to
[43:40] ride and each one fell off but little
[43:44] boy rote it right out to the end
[43:48] never made a
[43:50] wobble and so all the boys got around
[43:52] him and said how'd you do it he said
[43:54] I'll tell you boys here's where it was
[43:58] and I think this is so this is to me one
[44:01] of the critical points not that we want
[44:03] to be too busy analyzing other people
[44:05] but what does he say here he said I
[44:07] watched what you all were
[44:11] doing and I seen your
[44:13] mistake see you were looking down like
[44:16] this trying to keep it on the board I
[44:19] just watched the end and held
[44:23] steady that's right sometimes we can get
[44:26] so busy in our moment just worrying
[44:30] about this and worrying about that and
[44:33] and and if we continue to worry we're
[44:35] going to fuss and we're going to Stew
[44:36] and eventually we're going to wobble and
[44:38] then we'll find ourselves falling off
[44:39] our
[44:40] track and we know we can get back isn't
[44:43] that grace of God wonderful because all
[44:45] we got to do is go back to where we got
[44:47] off that's what we were
[44:49] taught brother Brown he says there you
[44:52] are see that's the idea not what's right
[44:55] here but the end and keep steady looking
[45:00] to the Lord
[45:02] Jesus don't get busy looking at me and
[45:05] you and the worst thing of all brothers
[45:08] and sisters don't get busy looking at
[45:10] yourself oh my goodness that can be a
[45:13] really tough one but we have to make
[45:16] sure that we are living our lives true
[45:19] and pure we certainly don't want to be
[45:22] misrepresenting but I think if we can
[45:24] humble ourselves in the sight of the
[45:25] Lord then he will pick us up up and we
[45:28] have the opportunity to go forwards and
[45:30] and he would that every one of us would
[45:32] actually make it right to the very
[45:34] end I just thought that was just for
[45:37] free tonight just uh a little tidbit for
[45:40] free you know what I want to do uh what
[45:43] I've done for the last uh I think at
[45:45] least one or two I'd like to go right to
[45:47] the very back of the book and uh read
[45:51] the last three paragraphs for those
[45:53] people who are tuning in those people
[45:55] who are maybe new to what we're doing
[45:58] here um talking about the exposition of
[46:00] the seven Church ages that was uh put
[46:03] together by William Mary and Bram people
[46:06] think that perhaps this is a cult and
[46:08] people want to potentially follow a man
[46:12] if you just listen to his words you
[46:14] might actually see what his intentions
[46:16] are and so as we enter into this next
[46:18] chapter the pergam and church age I just
[46:20] want to reinforce this I want to
[46:22] emphasize this the last three uh
[46:24] paragraphs do we have them there yeah so
[46:26] we conclude perfect so we conclude the
[46:28] seven Church ages saying only what the
[46:31] spirit said to each
[46:33] age not a new book not not some other
[46:38] author he that hath an ear let him hear
[46:41] what the spirit saith to the
[46:42] churches now brother brandham is saying
[46:44] here I sincerely believe that the spirit
[46:46] of God has been speaking to us not only
[46:49] teaching us the truths of the ages but
[46:52] he has been Faithfully dealing with our
[46:55] hearts that we may turn to
[46:58] him not turn to to William Mary and
[47:01] bradam not turn to Jeffersonville
[47:04] Indiana that we would turn to him that's
[47:08] the reason for all preaching and
[47:09] teaching for it is the preaching and
[47:12] teaching of the word that the sheep hear
[47:14] the voice of God and follow him and we
[47:18] know that's Ephesians chapter
[47:20] 4 not for one moment do I bring a
[47:23] message to the people that they may
[47:25] follow me or join my church or start
[47:30] some fellowship or an organization I
[47:33] have never done that and I will not do
[47:35] that now I have no interest in those
[47:38] things but I do have an interest in the
[47:40] things of God and people and if I can
[47:44] accomplish just one thing I will be
[47:46] satisfied that one thing is to see
[47:50] established a true spiritual
[47:52] relationship between God and Men wherein
[47:57] men become New Creations in who in
[48:02] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[48:05] according to his
[48:08] word now what cult founder would ever
[48:11] say these
[48:12] words point to Jesus
[48:16] Christ I would invite plead and warn all
[48:19] to hear his voice at this time and yield
[48:22] your lives completely to him even as I
[48:24] trust in my heart that I have given my
[48:27] all to him God bless you and may his
[48:29] coming Rejoice your heart amen not get
[48:33] us upset and feel awkward because now
[48:36] we're going to be on the spotlight he's
[48:38] going to be able to see all of our Lives
[48:40] we want to be able to Rejoice with
[48:42] him talking about the pergan church age
[48:45] I think it's a just a beautiful thing
[48:47] you know um verse 17 of uh Revelations
[48:50] chapter 2 here he says he that hath an
[48:52] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[48:53] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[48:57] what do they have to overcome the
[48:59] pergami and church age they have to
[49:01] overcome the Deeds of the
[49:04] nicians the people that want to try and
[49:07] conquer the leoty because it's not just
[49:10] one individual and it's not just one
[49:12] anointing even though it is it always is
[49:15] an anointing that falls on an individual
[49:17] but it's many faet multifaceted is what
[49:20] I'm trying to say they have to overcome
[49:22] the Deeds of the nicians the doctrine of
[49:25] the nicians
[49:27] specifically and they also have to
[49:30] overcome the doctrine of balum and that
[49:34] is a very big one that's very vast
[49:37] Doctrine it's not just single-handed
[49:40] it's not very specific and small the
[49:43] doctrine of balum is is very wide
[49:46] reaching but we know we've talked about
[49:49] this in the past I just think it's
[49:50] fascinating and I love the way brother
[49:51] Brandon brings it in this book we're
[49:52] going to get into it in a minute but I
[49:54] just wanted to say this how important it
[49:55] is to remember what was it that balum
[49:58] did he couldn't actually get God to
[50:00] curse the children of Israel because he
[50:02] had already blessed them and we know he
[50:04] tried to pay the prophet the hireling
[50:06] prophet and the hirling prophet said hey
[50:08] I went and ask God and God said nope
[50:10] can't do it I've already blessed them so
[50:12] they're blessed so just let them be
[50:14] blessed so he tried and he tried and the
[50:17] only thing he could do was go around the
[50:19] backside of the children of Israel and
[50:21] then start talking bad about the
[50:23] children of Israel and pointing out all
[50:25] of the little faults and all of the
[50:27] little things all of the humanity on and
[50:29] on and on it it and that's what happened
[50:32] and so before long they actually fell
[50:35] right it was only by that the the
[50:38] doctrine of balum terrible
[50:43] terrible let's begin the paman church
[50:49] age so brother Ram he has Revelations 2
[50:52] 2-17 I guess we'll read it and to the
[50:55] angel of the church and pergamus write
[50:57] these things saith he which hath a sharp
[51:00] sword with two edges I Know Thy works
[51:02] and where thou dwellest even where
[51:04] Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my
[51:07] name and Hast not denied my faith even
[51:11] in those days where an antipast was my
[51:13] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[51:15] where Satan dwelleth but I have a few
[51:18] things against thee because thou Hast
[51:20] there them that hold the doctrine of
[51:24] balum who taught balac to cast a
[51:27] stumbling block before the children of
[51:29] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[51:31] idols and to commit
[51:34] fornication so hast thou also them that
[51:38] hold the doctrine of the
[51:39] nicians which thing I hate so four very
[51:43] specific things that he's not pleased
[51:45] with that they have to overcome he goes
[51:48] on to say repent or else I will come
[51:50] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[51:52] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[51:56] hath ear let him hear what the spirit
[51:57] saith unto the churches to him that
[52:00] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[52:02] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[52:04] stone and in the stone a new name
[52:07] written which no man knoweth saving he
[52:10] that receiveth
[52:12] it
[52:15] pergamus pergamum the ancient name was
[52:19] situated in Mya I think I said that
[52:22] right I hope so in a district watered by
[52:24] Three Rivers by one of which it
[52:29] communicated to the Sea it was described
[52:32] as the most illustrious City in
[52:35] Asia it was a city of culture with a
[52:39] library second only to that in
[52:42] Alexandria I just can't help but think
[52:45] based on that description right there
[52:48] that it must have been a very modern
[52:49] city and it must have been full of
[52:52] knowledge they must have been very
[52:53] intelligent people to have the second
[52:56] best library and and to have culture
[53:00] civilization right yet it was a city of
[53:03] great sin given over to lenus writes of
[53:08] the worship of
[53:11] esup
[53:13] ASC leas sorry whom they
[53:17] worshiped in the form of a living
[53:20] serpent which was housed and fed in the
[53:25] temple in this beautiful city of
[53:27] irrigated Groves public walks and Parks
[53:31] lived a small group of dedicated
[53:33] believers who were not fooled by the
[53:36] veneer of beauty and aboard the satanic
[53:40] worship that filled the
[53:43] place amazing to think about this in
[53:47] their Temple they would have a
[53:50] beast the form of a living serpent in
[53:53] their church that they would
[53:55] worship but but it doesn't stop there
[53:58] going back I looked up the word
[54:00] lenus and
[54:03] uh you know there's a few definitions
[54:07] for it but it's unrestrained relations
[54:11] and that's edited because we're in a
[54:13] mixed audience unrestrained
[54:15] relations lascivious libertine lwd
[54:19] number two is unrestrained by law or
[54:23] general
[54:24] morality Lawless
[54:28] immoral number three is going Beyond
[54:31] customary or proper bounds or limits
[54:35] disregarding
[54:37] rules Lous rights of worship wow by this
[54:43] escap less and I looked this up and uh
[54:47] this was a man a male masculine who was
[54:50] the god of
[54:51] Medicine of healing of Rejuvenation and
[54:55] of Physicians
[54:57] so this is what they were worshiping
[54:59] this is how they were worshiping in
[55:01] their cultured educated environment and
[55:06] I just can't help but think you know
[55:07] this kind of dovetails with the life
[55:09] that we're living now the the culture
[55:12] and and the education the knowledge that
[55:14] we have and the world in which we live
[55:16] we've got lots of public parks pretty
[55:19] much every city you go to there's public
[55:20] parks and walkways with lots of
[55:23] depending on the time of year green
[55:25] areas and and lots of beauty you can see
[55:28] it and remember brother Bram says it
[55:30] he's said it multiple times thus far in
[55:32] this book that the the words that are
[55:34] spoken are for every age it's not just
[55:37] applicable to one
[55:39] age but here we have the Lous rights of
[55:43] worship of I got to learn this word
[55:47] here whom they worshiped in the form of
[55:50] a living Serpent and was housed and fed
[55:52] in the temple just tremendous
[55:57] the age the pergan age lasted about 300
[56:00] years from 312 to 606 ad the
[56:04] messenger using our god-given rule for
[56:06] choosing the messenger to each age that
[56:09] is we choose the one whose Ministry most
[56:13] closely approximates that of the first
[56:15] messenger Paul and we
[56:18] unhesitatingly declare the pergan church
[56:21] pergan Messenger to be Martin Martin was
[56:24] born in 315 in hungry however his life
[56:27] work was in France where he labored in
[56:30] and around tours as a bishop he died in
[56:35] 399 this great Saint was the uncle of
[56:39] another wonderful Christian St Patrick
[56:41] of
[56:42] Ireland Martin was converted to Christ
[56:45] while he was following a career as a
[56:47] professional Soldier it was while he was
[56:51] still engaged in this occupation that a
[56:53] most remarkable Miracle occurred it it
[56:56] is recorded that a beggar lay sick in
[56:58] the streets of the town where Martin was
[57:00] posted the winter was cold the the
[57:03] winter cold was more than he could bear
[57:06] for he was poorly clad no one paid any
[57:09] attention to his needs until Martin came
[57:11] by seeing this poor man's plight but not
[57:14] having extra garment he took off his
[57:17] outer cloak cut it in two with his sword
[57:20] and wrapped the cloth around the
[57:22] freezing man he attended him the best he
[57:26] could and went on his
[57:27] way that night the Lord Jesus appeared
[57:31] to him in a vision there he stood like a
[57:35] beggar wrapped in the half of Martin's
[57:39] garment he spoke to him and said Martin
[57:42] though he is only a
[57:45] cuman though he is only a cuman has
[57:49] clothed me with this
[57:51] garment from that time on Martin sought
[57:55] to serve the Lord with all his heart his
[57:58] life became a series of Miracles
[58:01] manifesting the power of
[58:03] God and I know that that is exactly the
[58:06] description of Martin for his day but I
[58:09] just I highlighted that in in in the
[58:12] thought that you know that is literally
[58:14] the life of a Believer today the devil
[58:17] will try and say no you don't have a
[58:19] series of Miracles manifesting the power
[58:21] of God but any True Believer knows it
[58:24] you don't have to look very far and you
[58:25] can say
[58:26] there there there there that's what that
[58:29] song is all about count your blessings
[58:32] how God helps us and deals with us along
[58:34] our way and many times things can seem
[58:37] like wow we did that does it happen
[58:40] because we did it or did God actually
[58:42] make it possible for us to do
[58:45] it after having left the Army and having
[58:48] become a leader in the church he took a
[58:51] very militant stand against
[58:54] idolatry he cut down the Groves broke up
[58:57] the images and pulled down the altars
[59:01] when confronted by the pagans for his
[59:04] deeds he challenged them in much the
[59:07] same manner as Elijah did the prophets
[59:09] of
[59:11] Baal he offered to be tied to a tree on
[59:15] its Underside so that when it was cut
[59:18] down it would crush him unless God
[59:20] intervened and turned the tree around
[59:22] while it fell the Wy Heathen tied him to
[59:25] a tree that was growing on the side of a
[59:28] hill assured that the natural pull of
[59:31] gravity would cause the tree to fall as
[59:33] to crush him just as the tree began to
[59:36] fall God swung it around an uphill
[59:40] contrary to the all natural laws the
[59:43] fleeing Heathen were crushed as the tree
[59:46] fell on several of
[59:48] them I just kind of gasped when I I read
[59:52] that part there I have it highlighted as
[59:54] well the same manner that Elijah did to
[59:56] the prophets of Baal remember that Mount
[59:59] Carmel Showdown he killed 400
[1:00:03] prophets and uh I mean that's pretty
[1:00:07] serious but he did it on the same basis
[1:00:10] historians acknowledge that on at least
[1:00:12] three occasions he raised the dead by
[1:00:15] faith in jesus' name in one instance he
[1:00:17] prayed for a dead baby like Elisha he
[1:00:20] stretched himself upon the babe and
[1:00:22] prayed it came back to life and health
[1:00:25] on another occasion he was called to
[1:00:27] help deliver a brother who is being
[1:00:29] carried away to his death in a time of
[1:00:32] great
[1:00:33] persecution by the time he arrived the
[1:00:36] poor man was already dead remember they
[1:00:38] didn't have phones in these days there
[1:00:40] was there was no sending a quick text or
[1:00:43] Whatsapp there was no immediate
[1:00:46] communication they had hanged him upon a
[1:00:48] tree his body was lifeless and his eyes
[1:00:50] protruded from the sockets but Martin
[1:00:53] took him down and when he had prayed the
[1:00:56] man was restored to life and to his
[1:00:59] rejoicing
[1:01:01] family Martin never did fear the enemy
[1:01:04] regardless of who it was am thus he went
[1:01:07] to personally face a wicked Emperor who
[1:01:10] was responsible for the death of many
[1:01:12] Spirit-filled
[1:01:14] Saints the emperor would not Grant an
[1:01:16] audience so Martin went to see a friend
[1:01:19] of the emperor one damasus a cruel
[1:01:23] Bishop of Rome but the bishop being a
[1:01:26] nominal Christian of the false Vine
[1:01:29] would not
[1:01:31] intercede Martin went back to the Palace
[1:01:34] but by now the gates had been locked and
[1:01:35] they would not allow him to enter he
[1:01:38] laid down on his face before the Lord
[1:01:41] and prayed that he would be able to get
[1:01:43] into the palace he heard a voice bidding
[1:01:46] him
[1:01:48] arise when he did so he saw the gates
[1:01:51] open of their own accord he walked into
[1:01:54] the court but the Arrogant ruler would
[1:01:57] not turn his head and speak to him
[1:02:01] Martin again prayed suddenly a fire came
[1:02:05] spontaneously from the seat of the
[1:02:07] throne and the unhappy Emperor vacated
[1:02:11] speedily sure the surely the Lord
[1:02:14] humbles the proud and exalts the
[1:02:18] lowly such was his adore in serving the
[1:02:22] lord that the devil was mightily aroused
[1:02:26] the enemies of Truth hired assassins to
[1:02:29] kill
[1:02:30] Martin can you believe this part they
[1:02:33] came by stealth to his home and as they
[1:02:36] were about to kill him he stood erect
[1:02:39] and bear his throat to the sword how
[1:02:43] many of us would do that
[1:02:44] tonight there it is go for it h
[1:02:49] wow as they leaped forward the power of
[1:02:52] God suddenly hurled them back across the
[1:02:55] room so overcome were they in that Holy
[1:02:59] and fearful atmosphere that they crawled
[1:03:02] upon their hands and knees and begged
[1:03:04] forgiveness for the attempt on his
[1:03:07] life too often men are signally used of
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:13] Lord they they become lifted up with
[1:03:17] pride but not so with Martin he ever
[1:03:21] remained The Humble servant of
[1:03:23] God one night as he was prep preparing
[1:03:26] himself to enter the pulpit a beggar
[1:03:28] came to his study and asked for some
[1:03:30] clothing Martin referred the beggar to
[1:03:33] his head Deacon the hottie Deacon
[1:03:36] commanded him to
[1:03:38] leave thereupon he went back to see
[1:03:40] Martin Martin arose and gave the beggar
[1:03:43] his own fine robe and bade the Deacon
[1:03:47] bring him another robe which was of
[1:03:49] lesser quality that night as Martin
[1:03:53] preached the word the flock of God saw a
[1:03:56] soft white glow of light around his
[1:03:59] person
[1:04:02] tremendous surely this was a great man a
[1:04:04] true Messenger to that age never
[1:04:07] desirous of ought and that ought means
[1:04:11] anything never desired anything but to
[1:04:13] please God he lived a most consecrated
[1:04:16] life never could he be induced to
[1:04:20] preach until he had first prayed and was
[1:04:24] in such a spiritual frame as to know and
[1:04:27] deliver the full counsel of God by the
[1:04:30] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven often
[1:04:34] he would keep the people waiting while
[1:04:36] he prayed for full Assurance pretty
[1:04:40] tough to keep on time when you do
[1:04:43] that just to know about Martin and his
[1:04:46] mighty Ministry might make one think
[1:04:48] that the persecution of the Saints had
[1:04:50] abated not so they were still being
[1:04:53] destroyed by the devil through the
[1:04:54] instrumental
[1:04:56] of the wicked they were burned at the
[1:04:58] stake they were nailed to logs face down
[1:05:02] and wild dogs were turned loose upon
[1:05:04] them so that the wild so that the dogs
[1:05:07] would tear away the Flesh and bowels
[1:05:09] leaving the victims to die in terrible
[1:05:12] torture babes were ripped from expectant
[1:05:15] mothers and thrown to
[1:05:17] Hogs people will answer for
[1:05:20] this woman's breasts were cut away and
[1:05:23] they were forced to stand erect while
[1:05:25] each heart throb poured out the blood
[1:05:27] until they crumpled in death and the
[1:05:31] tragedy was even greater to think about
[1:05:33] when one
[1:05:34] realizes that this was not solely the
[1:05:37] work of the
[1:05:38] Heathen but many times it was caused by
[1:05:43] so-called
[1:05:45] Christians who felt they did God a favor
[1:05:48] in Exterminating these loyal soldiers of
[1:05:51] the Cross who stood for the word and
[1:05:54] obedience to the Holy
[1:05:56] Spirit they weren't willing to
[1:05:58] compromise and go with the the flavor of
[1:06:02] the day John
[1:06:05] 16:2 they shall put you out of the
[1:06:07] synagogues yay the time cometh that
[1:06:10] whosoever kth you will think that he
[1:06:13] doeth God a service Mark
[1:06:16] 24:9 then they shall deliver you up to
[1:06:18] be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[1:06:21] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[1:06:24] name's sake
[1:06:26] you see the way these scriptures are the
[1:06:28] way the scripture is written is you
[1:06:30] cannot take and make it chronologically
[1:06:34] ordered because it applies over all of
[1:06:37] the
[1:06:39] ages especially when you get into the
[1:06:41] Book of Revelations the book of
[1:06:43] symbols going on though brother Bram
[1:06:45] says by signs and wonders by the power
[1:06:47] of the spirit Martin was truly
[1:06:49] Vindicated as the messenger to that age
[1:06:52] but not only was he gifted by a great
[1:06:55] minister
[1:06:56] he himself was forever true to the word
[1:06:59] of God he fought
[1:07:02] organization he with stod sin in high
[1:07:06] places he championed the truth in word
[1:07:09] and deed and lived out a full life of
[1:07:14] Christian Victory I just think that to
[1:07:17] me is like a a quote for our fridge
[1:07:21] another fridge quote maybe we could just
[1:07:23] see that as us he or she championed the
[1:07:27] truth in word and deed and lived out a
[1:07:30] full life of Christian Victory
[1:07:34] overcoming the devil knowing that he has
[1:07:36] no
[1:07:38] power doesn't have to be just Martin a
[1:07:41] biographer wrote of him on this wise no
[1:07:45] one ever saw him angry or disturbed or
[1:07:49] grieving or
[1:07:52] laughing he was always one and the same
[1:07:55] and seemed something Beyond mortal
[1:07:57] wearing on his countenance a sort of
[1:08:00] celestial Joy never was anything on his
[1:08:04] lips but Christ never anything in his
[1:08:07] heart but piety peace and
[1:08:11] pity often did he weep for the sins even
[1:08:16] of those his
[1:08:19] detractors who when he was quiet and
[1:08:22] absent attacked him with viperous lips
[1:08:27] and poisoned
[1:08:30] tongues many hated him for
[1:08:33] virtues they themselves did not
[1:08:36] possess and could not imitate and alas
[1:08:40] his bitterest asants were
[1:08:44] Bishops I just think this is amazing he
[1:08:47] championed the truth in word and deed
[1:08:50] and lived out a full life of Christian
[1:08:53] Victory and knowing that people people
[1:08:56] were stabbing him in the back
[1:08:57] slaughtering his character talking bad
[1:09:00] about him what what was it using using
[1:09:03] viperous lips with poison
[1:09:06] tongues what did he do he often wept for
[1:09:08] them and prayed for them what a
[1:09:11] tremendous thing it's encouraging
[1:09:14] Revelations 212 B these things saith he
[1:09:19] which hath the sharp sword with the two
[1:09:21] edges the salutation
[1:09:25] the message to the Third Church age is
[1:09:27] about to come forth the third scene of
[1:09:31] this unfolding drama of Christ in the
[1:09:34] midst of his church is about to be
[1:09:37] revealed with trumpet-like voice the
[1:09:39] spirit presents the matchless one he
[1:09:43] which hath the sharp sword with two
[1:09:47] edges how vastly different this
[1:09:50] is excuse me how vastly different is
[1:09:53] this presentation from the time
[1:09:55] when pilate introduced the Lamb of God
[1:09:59] clothed in mocking Robes of purple
[1:10:02] smitten and Thorn crowd saying behold
[1:10:06] your
[1:10:07] king now Regal robed and crowned with
[1:10:11] Glory stands the Risen Lord Christ the
[1:10:15] power of
[1:10:17] God in these
[1:10:20] words he which hath a sharp sword with
[1:10:22] two edges lies another revelation of
[1:10:25] godhead I love this he just goes
[1:10:28] so well into the godhead in this book in
[1:10:32] the Ephesian age you will recall he was
[1:10:35] set forth as the unchanging God in the
[1:10:37] saman age we saw him as the one true God
[1:10:42] and beside him there was no other now in
[1:10:45] this perian age there is but further
[1:10:47] revelation of his godhead set forth by
[1:10:50] his association with a sharp two-edged
[1:10:53] sword which is the word of God Hebrews
[1:10:57] 4:12 for the word of God is quick and
[1:11:00] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:11:03] sword piercing even to the dividing a
[1:11:05] Sunder of Soul and Spirit and of the
[1:11:08] joints and Marrow and is a discerner of
[1:11:12] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:11:15] and isn't that exactly what the second
[1:11:18] poll
[1:11:19] was Ephesians
[1:11:22] 6:17 and take the sword of the spirit
[1:11:25] which is the word of God Revelations
[1:11:29] 19313 and 15a and he was clothed with
[1:11:32] the vesture dipped in Blood and his name
[1:11:34] is called the word of God and out of his
[1:11:37] mouth goeth a sharp two-edged
[1:11:40] sword John 1 1:3 in the beginning was
[1:11:44] the word the word was with God and the
[1:11:47] Word was God the same word was in the
[1:11:50] beginning with God all things were made
[1:11:53] by him and without him him was not
[1:11:56] anything made that was made 1 John 5:7
[1:12:01] for there are three that bear record in
[1:12:03] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost and these three are
[1:12:11] one how do we get separation there I
[1:12:13] just don't understand
[1:12:15] that now we can see his association with
[1:12:18] the word he is the word that is he that
[1:12:24] is who he is is the word in his
[1:12:28] name in John 1:1 where it says in the
[1:12:31] beginning was the word the root from
[1:12:33] which we get our translation for word is
[1:12:37] logos which means the thought or
[1:12:41] concept it has the double meaning of
[1:12:43] thought and
[1:12:44] speech now a thought expressed is a word
[1:12:47] or words isn't that wonderful and
[1:12:50] beautiful John says the concept of God
[1:12:53] was expressed in Jesus and Paul says the
[1:12:55] very same thing in Hebrews 1 Hebrews 1
[1:12:59] 1:3 God who had sunre times and diverse
[1:13:02] manners spake in time past to the
[1:13:04] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[1:13:08] last days spoken unto us by his son
[1:13:11] logos whom he hath appointed heir of All
[1:13:14] Things by whom he also made the
[1:13:17] worlds who being the brightness of his
[1:13:21] glory and the expressed image of his
[1:13:24] person
[1:13:26] and upholding All Things by the word of
[1:13:28] his power when he had by himself purged
[1:13:33] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[1:13:37] the Majesty on
[1:13:39] high God became expressed in the person
[1:13:43] of Jesus Christ Jesus was the expressed
[1:13:49] image of God again in John 1:14 and the
[1:13:53] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:13:57] the very substance of God was made flesh
[1:13:59] and dwelt amongst us the great spirit
[1:14:03] God unto which no man could approach
[1:14:07] which no man had seen or could
[1:14:10] behold was now tabernacled in flesh and
[1:14:14] dwelt among men expressing the fullness
[1:14:17] of God to men I just can't help but
[1:14:22] think as we read this what would it have
[1:14:25] been like to be with Jesus we know
[1:14:28] people were uneasy being around William
[1:14:30] Bram for fear that he would understand
[1:14:33] their thoughts or be able to discern
[1:14:36] their heart what would it be like to get
[1:14:38] the Revelation that he is the son of the
[1:14:41] Living God and he is Manifest in flesh
[1:14:44] The Living Word right there in front of
[1:14:46] you
[1:14:48] my and to have him call us friend
[1:14:51] hey John 1:18 no man hath seen God at
[1:14:55] any time the only begotten son which is
[1:14:58] in the bosom of the father he hath
[1:15:01] declared him and you know as I say all
[1:15:03] of that I have to say this I'm going to
[1:15:05] I feel like I want to start preaching
[1:15:06] now but to think that you know once upon
[1:15:08] a time people could have actually been
[1:15:10] drawn to Jesus and got to know Jesus and
[1:15:12] and spoke to Jesus and recognized jesus'
[1:15:14] voice and and had all of the opportunity
[1:15:16] to experience Jesus God manifest In the
[1:15:19] Flesh The Living Word right there you
[1:15:22] know in our age even though Jesus has
[1:15:24] been God what did he do he called a
[1:15:26] prophet to remind us that he is the same
[1:15:29] yesterday today and forever brothers and
[1:15:31] sisters and he is still a discerner of
[1:15:33] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:15:34] heart he knows exactly who we are
[1:15:37] exactly where we're at exactly what
[1:15:39] we're going through amen and when we
[1:15:41] have struggles just remember Paul had
[1:15:44] struggles and he sought God Thrice for
[1:15:48] those struggles and what did God say to
[1:15:50] him hey you know what I know that you've
[1:15:53] got them and and it's just so that you
[1:15:55] don't get puffed up beyond recognition
[1:15:58] because of all the Revelation you've got
[1:16:00] you're going to have that thorn in your
[1:16:01] flesh in fact your flesh is the thorn in
[1:16:04] your flesh so get used to it just look
[1:16:06] at don't look at yourself don't look at
[1:16:08] other people just look at
[1:16:10] me this just gets me excited here
[1:16:14] sorry God who on occasion would manifest
[1:16:17] his presence by the cloud or Pillar of
[1:16:20] Fire that struck fear in the hearts of
[1:16:23] men this God whose heart characteristics
[1:16:27] were made known only by revelation of
[1:16:29] words through the prophets now became
[1:16:33] Emmanuel God With Us declaring himself
[1:16:37] not Jesus the representative of God not
[1:16:41] Jesus the ambassador of God
[1:16:45] Emmanuel God With Us that is so powerful
[1:16:50] the word declare is taken from the Greek
[1:16:53] root which we often interpret as
[1:16:58] exis sis which means to thoroughly
[1:17:02] explain and make clear that is what the
[1:17:05] Living Word Jesus did he brought God to
[1:17:09] us for he was
[1:17:12] God he revealed God to us with such
[1:17:15] perfect clarity that John could say this
[1:17:18] about him in 1 John 1
[1:17:21] 1-3 that which was from the beginning
[1:17:24] which we have heard logos means speech
[1:17:28] which we have seen with our eyes which
[1:17:30] we have looked upon and our hands have
[1:17:33] handled of the word of life for life was
[1:17:37] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[1:17:40] witness and show unto you that eternal
[1:17:43] life which was with the father and was
[1:17:48] manifested unto us I believe we could
[1:17:51] all just say those words and say Amen
[1:17:54] that which we have seen and heard
[1:17:57] declare we unto you that ye Also may
[1:18:01] have fellowship with us and truly our
[1:18:04] fellowship is with the father and with
[1:18:07] his son Jesus
[1:18:11] Christ he called him his son just so
[1:18:13] that we could actually comprehend
[1:18:15] because a father has a
[1:18:18] son but if Jesus is the son of the
[1:18:21] father and he has son
[1:18:25] Sons
[1:18:27] my then we got a
[1:18:31] brother it's tremendous to think you
[1:18:34] know I don't want to go I'm not going
[1:18:35] off on a tangent don't don't worry I
[1:18:38] just think it's amazing to think that
[1:18:40] God would condescend so far to allow us
[1:18:44] to be able to see him as a
[1:18:46] brother he doesn't want to see us
[1:18:48] doesn't want us to necessarily see him
[1:18:51] as God Almighty on the throne even
[1:18:52] though we can't help but understand that
[1:18:54] and acknowledge that but that he would
[1:18:57] come in a way that we could comprehend
[1:18:58] it with our finite Minds just amazing
[1:19:02] when God was truly revealed he was
[1:19:04] manifested in the flesh he that hath
[1:19:07] seen me hath seen the father that makes
[1:19:10] it pretty simple doesn't it now back in
[1:19:13] Hebrews 1 1:3 we made note that Jesus
[1:19:16] was the expressed image of God he was
[1:19:18] God expressing himself in man to man but
[1:19:24] there is something else to note in these
[1:19:25] verses especially verses 1 and two God
[1:19:28] who at sunre times and diverse manner
[1:19:31] spake in time pass unto the fathers by
[1:19:34] the prophets hath in these last days
[1:19:37] spoken unto us by his son I want you to
[1:19:40] notice here in the margin of your Bible
[1:19:43] you will see a correction the word by is
[1:19:46] not a correct translation it should be
[1:19:49] in not by it then reads correctly God
[1:19:52] spake in times past unto the fathers in
[1:19:56] the prophets by means of the
[1:20:00] word 1 Samuel
[1:20:03] 321b for the Lord revealed himself to
[1:20:06] Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the
[1:20:10] Lord that brings out 1 John 5:7
[1:20:14] perfectly the spirit and the word are
[1:20:18] one Jesus revealed the Father the word
[1:20:23] revealed the father Jesus was the Living
[1:20:26] Word praise God today he is still that
[1:20:31] Living Word when Jesus was upon the
[1:20:34] Earth he said in John 14:10 believest
[1:20:37] thou not that I am in the father and the
[1:20:40] father in me the words that I speak unto
[1:20:43] you I speak not of myself but the father
[1:20:46] that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:20:50] works we know even
[1:20:52] Nicodemus who had to go to to see him
[1:20:55] after dark because he couldn't be seen
[1:20:57] or heard coming to meet the rabbi but
[1:21:01] even he said we know that these are not
[1:21:04] works of man that this is the work of
[1:21:07] God it has to be there's no man that can
[1:21:09] do
[1:21:10] this here it is most evidently set forth
[1:21:14] that the perfect manifestation of God in
[1:21:16] the sun was by the indwelling spirit
[1:21:21] manifesting in word and works and I've
[1:21:26] got that highlighted I'm going to read
[1:21:27] it again because I believe that that is
[1:21:30] our Victory today here it is most
[1:21:33] evidently set forth that the perfect
[1:21:35] manifestation of God in the sun was by
[1:21:39] the indwelling spirit manifesting in
[1:21:42] word and works he goes on to say that is
[1:21:45] exactly what we have been teaching all
[1:21:49] along and when the bride will get back
[1:21:51] to being a word bride she will produce
[1:21:55] the very works that Jesus
[1:22:00] produced I say Lord help me get back to
[1:22:02] being a a word bride I just want to be a
[1:22:05] word bride that's all I want to be my
[1:22:08] the word is God the spirit is God they
[1:22:12] are all one one cannot work apart from
[1:22:16] the other if one truly has the spirit of
[1:22:19] God he will have the word of God and
[1:22:22] brothers and sisters that's why I say
[1:22:24] God God's will is his word and if you
[1:22:26] want his will get his word and take that
[1:22:30] and apply it in every area of your life
[1:22:32] and see if he won't bless
[1:22:35] you that is how it was with the prophets
[1:22:38] they had the indwelling spirit of God
[1:22:41] and the word came to them that is how it
[1:22:44] was with Jesus in him was the spirit
[1:22:47] without measure and the word came to him
[1:22:51] Jesus both began to do and teach
[1:22:55] my Doctrine is not my own but the
[1:22:57] fathers that sent me acts 1:1 John
[1:23:01] 716 remember now John the Baptist was
[1:23:04] both the prophet and the messenger of
[1:23:06] his day he was filled with the holy
[1:23:08] ghost from his mother's womb when he was
[1:23:11] baptizing in Jordan the word of God
[1:23:13] Jesus came to him the word always comes
[1:23:17] to the truly Spirit
[1:23:20] failed the word always comes to the
[1:23:23] truly spirit filled and what Spirit are
[1:23:27] we talking about brothers and sisters
[1:23:28] not the spirit of Calgary Living Word
[1:23:31] Assembly not the spirit of some other
[1:23:34] church not not not the spirit of of of
[1:23:37] some tradition or teaching but the
[1:23:39] spirit of the Living God the baptism of
[1:23:42] the Holy Ghost is that Spirit the word
[1:23:46] always comes to the truly spirit filled
[1:23:50] that is the evidence of being filled
[1:23:53] with the Holy holy ghost that is what
[1:23:56] Jesus said would be the evidence he said
[1:23:58] in John 1416 to17 a I will pray the
[1:24:02] father and he will send you another
[1:24:04] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:24:07] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:24:09] the world cannot receive now some people
[1:24:12] would take that and try and make it that
[1:24:13] it's another comforter it's it's
[1:24:16] something else but it's nothing other
[1:24:19] than the spirit of Jesus Christ that he
[1:24:21] broke apart at Calvary and sent back on
[1:24:24] every other man who is able to receive
[1:24:26] it he goes on to say now we know what
[1:24:29] truth is Thy word is truth John
[1:24:33] 1717b again in John 8 why do ye not
[1:24:37] understand my speech even because ye
[1:24:39] cannot hear my word if we have ears to
[1:24:43] hear what the spirit sayith to the
[1:24:44] church brothers and sisters it is
[1:24:46] something else it's beyond what we can
[1:24:48] even comprehend in this
[1:24:50] life did you notice that Jesus said the
[1:24:54] world could not receive the Holy
[1:24:58] Ghost my my my my well in this verse I
[1:25:03] just read neither could they receive the
[1:25:06] word why because the spirit and the word
[1:25:11] are
[1:25:12] one and if you have the Holy Spirit as
[1:25:15] the prophets the word would come to you
[1:25:19] amen you would receive it I think this
[1:25:24] is is just lightning here this is
[1:25:27] electrified this is incredible because
[1:25:30] the spirit and the word are one and if
[1:25:32] you have the Holy Spirit brothers and
[1:25:34] sisters as the prophets listen how he
[1:25:36] says that as if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:25:38] as the prophets what isn't that a a
[1:25:41] prophetic off isn't that something out
[1:25:43] there is isn't that for another so no no
[1:25:46] no this is what the prophet is saying if
[1:25:48] you have the Holy Spirit like the
[1:25:50] prophets the word would come to you you
[1:25:54] would receive it remember what we just
[1:25:56] read the word always comes to truly
[1:25:58] spirit filled that is the evidence of
[1:26:00] being filled with the Holy Ghost and boy
[1:26:03] oh boy I just love these nuggets I have
[1:26:05] to read them again I just I'm getting
[1:26:07] excited here when the bride will get
[1:26:09] back to being a word bride she will
[1:26:12] produce the very works that Jesus
[1:26:13] produced the word is God the spirit is
[1:26:16] God they are all one they cannot work
[1:26:18] apart from one another my goodness John
[1:26:21] 14:26 but the comforter which is the the
[1:26:24] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[1:26:27] my name he shall teach you all things
[1:26:32] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:26:35] whatsoever I have said unto you here
[1:26:40] again we find the word coming because of
[1:26:42] the spirit of God John
[1:26:45] 1613 how be it when he the spirit of
[1:26:47] Truth word is come he will guide you
[1:26:50] into all truth Thy word is truth for he
[1:26:53] shall not speak speak of himself but
[1:26:56] whatsoever he shall hear word of God
[1:26:59] that shall he speak word and he will
[1:27:02] show you things to come Spirit bringing
[1:27:06] the word of
[1:27:09] Prophecy just going to pause there for a
[1:27:11] second Spirit bringing the word of
[1:27:14] Prophecy it's not all on brother bram's
[1:27:16] shoulders brothers and sisters he
[1:27:18] couldn't teach everything that he knew
[1:27:22] and he even said that it was up to other
[1:27:24] individuals to expound upon this word he
[1:27:27] didn't have time to do it he came and
[1:27:29] did the introduction he did his job but
[1:27:32] what he's saying here is that there's
[1:27:34] got to be people that will actually get
[1:27:36] the true spirit that the word will
[1:27:39] actually come to and what happens when
[1:27:41] that happens is it's Bingo Revelation
[1:27:43] wow I was thinking about that when the
[1:27:46] service was happening when the preacher
[1:27:48] was preaching something came into my
[1:27:49] heart and I went and I looked it up and
[1:27:51] I thought I've never heard this before
[1:27:53] I've never even thought this before and
[1:27:54] when I looked it up in the Bible it
[1:27:56] matched the scripture and when I typed
[1:27:57] it in to search into the message I saw
[1:27:59] it came up in the message that's exactly
[1:28:01] what brother Bram said when you put
[1:28:03] those two together brothers and sisters
[1:28:05] Bingo you've got Revelation from God
[1:28:07] directly from God speaking directly to
[1:28:09] you when you have his Spirit the word
[1:28:12] will always come to you I I just love
[1:28:15] that that gets me that gets me
[1:28:18] going boy I want you to note very
[1:28:21] carefully that Jesus did not say that
[1:28:23] the evidence of being baptized with the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:28:27] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[1:28:29] dancing he said the evidence would be
[1:28:32] that you would be in the truth amen and
[1:28:37] brothers and sisters it's so easy isn't
[1:28:39] it to say I'm in the truth oh yes I know
[1:28:43] the truth I've got all the books I've
[1:28:46] got all the tapes I've been to
[1:28:48] Jeffersonville I know this Minister I
[1:28:51] know that Minister and better yet they
[1:28:52] know me yeah
[1:28:55] yeah but have you got the
[1:28:58] spirit because if you don't got the
[1:29:00] spirit then the word's not coming to you
[1:29:02] and alls you have is an education you've
[1:29:04] got knowledge in your head but it's got
[1:29:06] to go from here to here it's got to make
[1:29:10] that that
[1:29:12] Journey 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man
[1:29:16] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:29:19] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:29:21] things that I write unto you
[1:29:25] are not just the instruction of the Lord
[1:29:28] not just suggestions of the lord they're
[1:29:32] Commandments of the
[1:29:35] Lord what Paul taught brothers and
[1:29:37] sisters is not
[1:29:39] optional they're Commandments of
[1:29:43] God
[1:29:44] Amen or else that scripture is
[1:29:47] false that's that's out of the King
[1:29:49] James version right there isn't it 1
[1:29:51] Corinthians 14:37 that's actually false
[1:29:53] scripture
[1:29:54] if that's not
[1:29:56] true but how do we just go and take
[1:29:59] scripture out I remember brother Ken
[1:30:02] talking about that you know there's one
[1:30:03] in there that you just don't like it
[1:30:04] just doesn't work for your flesh so you
[1:30:06] just want to get in there and you just
[1:30:07] want to tear it out but when you do that
[1:30:10] where do you stop once you start tear
[1:30:12] out this page tear out that half of
[1:30:13] another page and maybe just a corner of
[1:30:15] another one all these different places
[1:30:17] throughout the Bible then you have an
[1:30:18] incomplete Bible you know sometimes you
[1:30:20] don't even have to do that all you got
[1:30:21] to do is buy a different version of the
[1:30:23] Bible and and we saw that that that go
[1:30:26] around on what's at but it's so true
[1:30:28] we've got to be careful the devil is
[1:30:30] very very subtle
[1:30:34] am 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think
[1:30:37] himself to be a
[1:30:39] prophet not many people think of
[1:30:41] themselves to be prophets I know there's
[1:30:42] some people out there that do even in
[1:30:43] the message but I know there's a
[1:30:46] prophetic class of people but there's
[1:30:48] only one major prophet to this age
[1:30:50] brothers and sisters If any man think of
[1:30:52] himself to be a prophet or be
[1:30:54] spiritual let him acknowledge the things
[1:30:57] I write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:31:00] the Lord Brother bradam goes on to see
[1:31:02] now see that the proof of the indwelling
[1:31:05] spirit was to acknowledge and
[1:31:09] follow what God's Prophet gave for his
[1:31:13] age right
[1:31:18] amen as he set the church in order Paul
[1:31:21] had to say though to those who claim
[1:31:23] claimed another Revelation verse
[1:31:26] 36 what came the word of God out from
[1:31:32] you or came it unto you
[1:31:36] only brother Bram goes on to say the
[1:31:38] evidence of a spirit filled Christian
[1:31:40] believer is not to produce the truth
[1:31:45] word but to receive the truth
[1:31:50] word and to believe it
[1:31:53] and Obey
[1:31:55] it and you know we've heard it said many
[1:31:58] times obedience is just so much better
[1:32:00] than sacrifice it's so much better than
[1:32:03] sacrifice the evidence of a
[1:32:05] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:32:08] to produce the truth
[1:32:11] word not looking for signs and wonders
[1:32:14] but to just simply receive receive the
[1:32:16] truth receive the word when we hear it
[1:32:18] we just raise up our hands and say be it
[1:32:20] unto me according to Thy word Lord I
[1:32:22] just want to receive the truth the word
[1:32:24] and the spirit and then I will thereby
[1:32:26] be able to believe it and Obey it he
[1:32:29] goes on to say have you noticed in
[1:32:31] Revelations 2217 and the spirit and the
[1:32:33] bride say come and let him that heareth
[1:32:36] say come see the bride
[1:32:40] speaks the same word as does the
[1:32:44] spirit she doesn't put interpretations
[1:32:47] on the message of the hour we just read
[1:32:50] that the bride the the believer the true
[1:32:52] Spirit fill believer will actually
[1:32:54] follow the word of the messenger for
[1:32:57] their age they won't say oh I can just
[1:32:59] do it this way and I can do it that way
[1:33:01] and I can just make it the other no
[1:33:03] they'll follow exactly what the
[1:33:04] messenger said for that age she is a
[1:33:07] word bride proving she has the
[1:33:14] spirit boy I just feel like I could
[1:33:16] preach that's why I'm pausing here I
[1:33:19] just she is a word bride proving she has
[1:33:22] the spirit in every Church age we hear
[1:33:24] these words he that hath an ear let him
[1:33:27] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:33:28] churches the spirit gives the word if
[1:33:33] you have the spirit you will hear the
[1:33:35] word for your age as those true
[1:33:38] Christians took the word for their
[1:33:42] age did you get that last
[1:33:44] thought I repeat every Church age ends
[1:33:48] with the same admonition he that hath an
[1:33:51] ear let him and individual hear what the
[1:33:55] spirit saith to the churches the spirit
[1:33:59] gives the
[1:34:02] word how can we get the word without the
[1:34:05] spirit we just have to have the Holy
[1:34:07] Spirit brothers and sisters and if we
[1:34:09] have the Holy Spirit then we'll line up
[1:34:11] with this word and we'll say Amen to
[1:34:12] this word and this word will come to
[1:34:15] us it won't upset us it won't make us
[1:34:19] uneasy it it won't be the same old same
[1:34:21] old it'll be a a renewing every single
[1:34:25] time the spirit gives the word he has
[1:34:28] the truth for each age each age has had
[1:34:33] its own elect and that elect group
[1:34:35] always heard the word and received it
[1:34:39] proving they had the seed in them John
[1:34:44] 8:47 and he that is of god Hearth God's
[1:34:48] words ye therefore hear them not because
[1:34:52] ye are not of God that's
[1:34:57] harsh they refused the
[1:35:00] word
[1:35:02] Jesus they refused Jesus many people
[1:35:05] could say that they refused Jesus but I
[1:35:06] love the way the prophet says that they
[1:35:08] refuse the word right and his works for
[1:35:12] their days but the true seed received
[1:35:15] the word because they were of God Isaiah
[1:35:19] 54:13 and all thy children shall be
[1:35:23] taught of God Holy
[1:35:26] Spirit I'll call the musicians as we
[1:35:30] close
[1:35:31] here Jesus said the same thing in John
[1:35:35] 6:45 being one with the word proves
[1:35:40] whether you are of God and spirit
[1:35:44] filled no other
[1:35:50] Criterion I love it there's no wiggle
[1:35:53] room here there's no room for
[1:35:55] interpreting it and saying well it
[1:35:56] should be this way or that way this is
[1:35:57] what the prophet said the prophet was
[1:35:59] the mouthpiece of God this I would have
[1:36:01] to say in my own opinion would be God
[1:36:03] speaking through the prophet to the age
[1:36:05] of people who would be willing to pick
[1:36:07] up this book and read
[1:36:09] it Jesus said the same thing in John
[1:36:12] 6:45 being one with the word proves
[1:36:16] whether you are of God and spirit filled
[1:36:20] no other
[1:36:21] Criterion but what are and
[1:36:23] interpretation and the other gifts they
[1:36:26] are
[1:36:27] manifestations that is what the word
[1:36:30] teaches read it in 1 Corinthians
[1:36:33] 2:7 but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:36:35] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:36:38] then Paul names those
[1:36:41] manifestations now comes this very good
[1:36:43] question I know that you are all anxious
[1:36:47] to ask why isn't the manifestation an
[1:36:50] Evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:36:52] Ghost
[1:36:54] because you surely could not manifest
[1:36:56] the Holy Ghost unless you were truly
[1:36:59] Spirit-filled
[1:37:03] now I'm just going to stop there because
[1:37:05] this
[1:37:06] gets we need to read a lot more to
[1:37:08] actually answer it maybe stand with me
[1:37:10] tonight as we
[1:37:13] close I just get carried away I can't
[1:37:17] help it brothers and sisters when the
[1:37:19] bride will get back to being a word
[1:37:21] bride I say Lord help me help me be a
