[48:54] okay good
[48:57] says a song of degrees of Solomon except
[49:00] the Lord build a house they labored in
[49:03] vain that built it except the Lord keep
[49:07] the city The Watchman wake it but in
[49:10] vain it is vain for you to rise up early
[49:14] to sit up late to eat bread of Sorrows
[49:18] for so he giveth his beloved sleep may
[49:22] the Lord add a blessing from the reading
[49:23] of the scripture you all may be seated
[49:26] amen
[49:28] praise God
[49:34] hallelujah
[49:37] amen there you
[49:40] go that's
[49:44] right
[49:46] amen so the scripture is very clear okay
[49:49] so except the Lord build the house
[49:52] except the Lord who call you see uh what
[49:56] what we did what we are going to do it's
[49:59] all in vain see praise God see like I
[50:02] say you know uh like like same like with
[50:06] the minister if your denomination call
[50:08] you see so definitely that your
[50:11] denomination will support you and you
[50:14] will also preach the teaching of your
[50:18] denomination see then if you call
[50:22] yourself then you will support yourself
[50:25] then you will teach
[50:27] your own
[50:29] teaching praise God but then if God call
[50:33] you definitely he will support you amen
[50:37] see and you will preach what God's want
[50:41] you to preach amen what's the word of
[50:43] God is okay that's why when I go out you
[50:47] know the first time I go into the uh in
[50:50] the ministry I'm already in the mission
[50:52] field see praise God I have no
[50:56] background ground I mean I never went
[50:58] into any Bible school and even when I'm
[51:01] studying in University you know you know
[51:05] in high school we have no
[51:07] religion see I have I know nothing about
[51:11] religion I know that there is God and
[51:15] what the problem where is God Is praise
[51:19] God hallelujah so when he called me into
[51:22] the
[51:23] ministry I only asked him I said Lord
[51:27] if you want me to go in the ministry
[51:29] first you teach
[51:31] me secondly you support me I said to the
[51:36] Lord once my wife and my children
[51:40] complain I will
[51:42] stop see once my children my family got
[51:46] you know
[51:48] hungry I will go out and work I know how
[51:52] to work praise God I've been working
[51:55] since how I'm 15 years
[51:57] old see so when the Lord called
[52:03] me I say uh that's a two thing that I'm
[52:06] required for him to
[52:08] do teach me see praise God then he gave
[52:13] me this scripture okay he said except
[52:16] the Lord build a house they labor in
[52:19] vain say it's all in vain praise God
[52:23] even he said if you rise up early you
[52:25] sit up late you eat the bread of
[52:28] Sorrow it's all in
[52:30] vain but to his beloved he will give
[52:34] them
[52:35] rest see then he said except the Lord
[52:39] keep the city The Watchman Wicked but
[52:42] invade see you know uh if you try to uh
[52:48] um how do you say
[52:50] it praise
[52:54] God uh to protect prot yourself from
[52:57] this false Doctrine or this teaching and
[52:59] this teaching praise God see unless the
[53:04] Lord keep you
[53:06] see even even if you do uh if you work
[53:10] hard even if you do this if you do that
[53:13] everything will be in vain so everything
[53:15] is of the Lord okay praise God see so we
[53:20] have no problem if God call you we we
[53:24] have no problem if God establish you
[53:27] see whatever whatever happened praise
[53:30] God you are standing on the Solid Rock
[53:32] Amen praise God see now it says here
[53:37] praise the
[53:39] Lord this it
[53:45] says in Hebrew chapter 6 verse 1-3 amen
[53:50] see therefore leaving the principles of
[53:52] the doctrine of Christ let us go unto
[53:55] Perfection now not laying again the
[53:57] foundation of repentance from dead works
[53:59] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[54:02] of baptism and of Li laying of hands and
[54:05] of resurrection of the dead and of
[54:08] Eternal judgment and this we will do if
[54:10] God
[54:11] permit see so there is really you know
[54:16] uh praise God that's why I've been
[54:18] saying now this message is different
[54:21] okay this is not about the justification
[54:24] message this is not the sanctification
[54:27] message nor the baptism of the Holy
[54:30] Ghost message we have more than that
[54:33] okay praise God see and then the prophet
[54:36] said this is a prophetic
[54:38] message praise God see when you say this
[54:41] is a prophetic message praise God it has
[54:44] something to do prophecy has something
[54:47] to do with the events past present and
[54:51] future events then as a Christian praise
[54:55] God Paul said we need to progress praise
[55:00] God see laying aside the basic teaching
[55:03] there is really a basic
[55:05] teaching see that's why Paul said
[55:09] Hallelujah not laying us again the
[55:12] foundation of repentance from dead Works
[55:15] Faith
[55:17] baptism healing resurrection of death
[55:22] and eternal
[55:23] judgment he said you need to go unto
[55:28] Perfection see same thing that's why
[55:30] I've been saying to the people this
[55:32] message is different this is
[55:36] Progressive a lot of things the prophet
[55:39] said during his time but the people can
[55:43] see it yet praise God Amen but in our
[55:48] age we can see it very clear praise the
[55:52] Lord see but it is still in the message
[55:57] amen remember that we cannot go outside
[55:59] the message we cannot go outside the
[56:02] Bible okay praise God but now I just
[56:05] want to speak about you know the let us
[56:08] go unto Perfection okay see we need to
[56:12] go unto Perfection see now the Greek
[56:16] Lexicon praise God hallelujah it says
[56:19] here Perfection came from the Greek word
[56:22] teos see meaning it say
[56:26] of men full grown adult of full age
[56:31] mature see praise God hallelujah so we
[56:36] need to go I mean uh you need we need to
[56:39] be mature right right praise God see I
[56:43] want to share this subject because I
[56:45] want you to I I want uh we need to know
[56:48] the message is uh it's a different okay
[56:52] praise God the message will always tell
[56:54] you what you are
[56:56] praise God in that way you can you can
[56:59] understand where you are see praise God
[57:03] after this uh after this I do believe
[57:06] you will understand where you are okay
[57:09] praise God see Christian are being
[57:13] processed see praise God Hallelujah to
[57:17] the young people then you will
[57:18] understand it okay Hallelujah also to
[57:21] the parents Hallelujah sometimes we love
[57:24] our young uh our young people okay
[57:27] praise God but sometimes they just don't
[57:30] understand what's happening see and I'm
[57:33] I'm always saying most of the young
[57:36] people they are not yet born again see
[57:39] that's a problem with the parents
[57:40] sometimes they are trying to they are
[57:43] asking the children to live a born again
[57:45] life see when they are not yet born
[57:47] again how can you do that see that's why
[57:50] the prophet keep on say how can you draw
[57:52] blood out of the
[57:54] turnip see praise God hallelujah see to
[57:58] the young people I I I'm just always
[58:00] telling them just come to the church
[58:03] listen come to the church listen sit
[58:06] there and listen don't you worry Faith
[58:10] cometh by hearing see praise God
[58:15] hallelujah see so to the parents I've
[58:18] been always telling it to them don't be
[58:20] to legalist you know don't ask a born
[58:23] again life from your children when they
[58:24] are not yet born again
[58:26] see and most of the children 85% are not
[58:30] yet born again they are born in the
[58:33] message through praise God see we
[58:36] discipline them we teach them Hallelujah
[58:40] but unless praise God they be born again
[58:43] Hallelujah all these things are just uh
[58:46] information for them praise God
[58:49] hallelujah amen see praise God but to
[58:53] them that are born in the spirit now you
[58:55] start growing okay and and Paul says you
[58:59] need to go unto Perfection you need to
[59:03] mature praise God see if after 20 years
[59:07] your pastor pastor Barry keep on
[59:10] preaching keep on telling you you need
[59:12] to be Sanctified then there is a
[59:14] problem
[59:16] Hallelujah
[59:18] see Hallelujah you need to go onto
[59:21] Perfection this is laying aside those
[59:24] things good works
[59:27] Faith praise God if up to I if up to now
[59:31] I've been I I'm going to teach preach
[59:34] about faith
[59:37] Hallelujah
[59:39] see we too
[59:42] late praise the Lord see you need to go
[59:45] unto maturity okay now see even the
[59:49] Bible is keep telling us he says here we
[59:52] know we know that all things work
[59:54] together for good to them that love God
[59:57] to them who are called according to his
[1:00:00] purpose for for whom he did forn he also
[1:00:03] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:00:07] image of his son that he might be the
[1:00:09] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:00:12] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:00:14] called and whom he called them he also
[1:00:16] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:00:19] also glorified okay so all things will
[1:00:24] will going to work together
[1:00:26] for good to us to them that love God all
[1:00:32] God will use everything amen okay praise
[1:00:36] God sometimes we look at is something
[1:00:39] bad things that happening in our life
[1:00:42] but God is trying to do something in
[1:00:44] your life so that you will grow amen see
[1:00:49] praise God because we are
[1:00:52] predestinated to conform in the image of
[1:00:55] his son

[1:10:23] that's why that's why the the message
[1:10:26] told us there there there are three step
[1:10:28] of Grace right justification
[1:10:32] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:36] okay praise God and then now
[1:10:42] Hallelujah see we have this type in
[1:10:45] Shadow okay the Old Testament is a
[1:10:47] shadow so praise God see sometimes we
[1:10:50] need the shadow okay in that way in that
[1:10:54] way it will check we need to have a
[1:10:57] check and balance remember that praise
[1:11:00] God everything that's happening in our
[1:11:02] age you can see that in the New
[1:11:04] Testament you can also see that in Old
[1:11:07] Testament praise God see hallelujah amen
[1:11:12] because the Bible said for the law
[1:11:13] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:11:16] see and not the very image of the things
[1:11:19] can now see it is not the very image of
[1:11:22] the things but it is praise God a sh
[1:11:25] shadow of something good will coming out
[1:11:28] praise God hallelujah God show us you
[1:11:31] know praise God that's why Jesus Keep on
[1:11:34] uh uh explaining to them you know
[1:11:39] sometimes he he explain it in Parable
[1:11:43] sometimes uh uh he explain it through
[1:11:46] Shadow praise God because he said if I
[1:11:49] will tell you directly you will not
[1:11:53] understand me see that's why God gave us
[1:11:55] this shadow in that way we can
[1:11:58] understand praise God hallelujah see now
[1:12:04] it says
[1:12:06] here you know so we are going to study
[1:12:09] about how the Christian grow okay praise
[1:12:13] God see now when God asked Moses in
[1:12:17] Exodus 25:8 to9 Hallelujah see he says
[1:12:22] here and let them make me a sanctuary
[1:12:24] that I May dwell among them see the
[1:12:28] purpose of this Sanctuary is so so that

[1:37:21] Candlestick then we have this another
[1:37:23] another altar see praise God this is
[1:37:26] where uh the altar of incense and then
[1:37:30] we have this uh
[1:37:33] uh uh un living bread okay you know this
[1:37:39] is man-made
[1:37:41] light okay so when you go into this
[1:37:44] place praise God okay when the priest go
[1:37:48] into that place he will change his
[1:37:52] Rob see
[1:37:54] praise God and then that robe you cannot
[1:37:57] sweat once you sweat you
[1:38:01] die see praise God hallelujah that's a
[1:38:05] spal robe see when the Christian go into
[1:38:08] this area we call it the holy place that
[1:38:12] is where you stop
[1:38:14] drinking see stop gambling stop smoking
[1:38:19] see that's why we call it holy Place
[1:38:22] praise God
[1:38:24] Hallelujah see a lot of people can come
[1:38:27] into the first right here in the outside
[1:38:30] Court praise God hallelujah but in this
[1:38:34] area praise God when you go into
[1:38:39] here all your all all your vies will
[1:38:43] stop amen that's the people that's why
[1:38:45] the people think oh I'm now born again
[1:38:49] right see
[1:38:53] God is with me
[1:38:55] now not yet amen
[1:38:59] see there is no God here God is in this
[1:39:04] area praise God hallelujah so when you
[1:39:08] go in
[1:39:09] here praise God you have also something
[1:39:13] to eat the unliving bread see so when
[1:39:16] the Christian go into this place now he
[1:39:19] will start eat the unle bread what is
[1:39:22] the UNL bread the word of God see where
[1:39:27] did the where is the B where where in
[1:39:29] the Bible that said that the woman
[1:39:31] cannot cut their hair see then you will
[1:39:33] ask the manmade
[1:39:36] light see praise God that's why Jesus
[1:39:39] said you enjoy the light of John right
[1:39:42] but I am the True Light see ministers
[1:39:45] are
[1:39:46] light praise God hallelujah that's why
[1:39:50] I've been telling you to the people you
[1:39:51] know you don't need to encourage the
[1:39:54] congregation you just need to encourage
[1:39:56] the pastor and the church will be
[1:39:58] encouraged you don't need to revive the
[1:40:00] church you revive the pastor praise God
[1:40:04] see imagine if your pastor every time he
[1:40:07] will come here and he he got a long
[1:40:10] face oh my my oh my
[1:40:14] my what a life what a
[1:40:18] life what will happen to the
[1:40:21] congregation see everybody is a long
[1:40:24] face also see when you go out of the
[1:40:27] church all are
[1:40:29] sad see praise God that's why anywhere I
[1:40:33] go in the mission field I want to make
[1:40:36] sure the pastor will be encouraged
[1:40:39] because he will the he is the one that
[1:40:41] will encourage his people not the people
[1:40:43] to encourage the pastor see sometimes
[1:40:47] the pastor is asking the people to
[1:40:48] encourage him no you are the
[1:40:51] leader praise God see you must show them
[1:40:55] that you're strong you cannot even show
[1:40:58] them you know praise God that you're
[1:41:00] crying you need to show them that I'm
[1:41:03] strong even inside you're
[1:41:06] crying Hallelujah see praise God he is
[1:41:11] the man-made light that's why if there
[1:41:13] is some problem you will go to your
[1:41:15] pastor when you are inside the SE there
[1:41:18] is the altar of
[1:41:19] incense it represent the prayer when you
[1:41:22] go into that area now you become
[1:41:25] prayerful before you go out you will
[1:41:28] pray praise God see before you eat you
[1:41:31] pray before you go anywhere you want to
[1:41:34] ask the Lord then you will go to your
[1:41:37] light to the manmade light Pastor I'm
[1:41:40] going to this area Pastor I I I'm going
[1:41:42] to do this Hallelujah see that's why
[1:41:46] when the oil in that lamb see praise God
[1:41:51] become few
[1:41:55] what will happen then the light will
[1:41:58] become
[1:41:59] small see that's why when the pastor he
[1:42:02] is the light of this
[1:42:04] church praise God if the oil become few
[1:42:08] then his light will become small then
[1:42:11] the
[1:42:12] church praise God will become
[1:42:15] dark
[1:42:17] Hallelujah see praise God that's why now
[1:42:21] see when a Christian go into that area
[1:42:24] you're not going to eat you not you now
[1:42:27] want to read the the scripture you know
[1:42:30] now you want to see where where the

[1:42:46] our
[1:42:47] life see we want to read the we want to
[1:42:50] read the Bible when you come into this
[1:42:55] place you will become

[1:46:17] pastor
[1:46:18] is praise God hallelujah see so you need
[1:46:23] to
[1:46:24] be praise
[1:46:28] God you need to do
[1:46:31] it see respect them they are accountable
[1:46:36] to your soul praise God see if you if
[1:46:41] you think in in our church okay not in
[1:46:43] this church I've been telling it to my
[1:46:45] people if you think that I am not your
[1:46:47] pastor you better go

[1:46:52] me me I am not your pastor you better go
[1:46:56] out I just want you to be in the Rapture
[1:46:59] that's all in my heart right see if my

[1:47:14] am God representative to
[1:47:16] you see Hallelujah so it's very
[1:47:20] important okay Hallelujah then see next
[1:47:25] thing we have what we call the
[1:47:27] supernatural
[1:47:30] light so you need to move on you know
[1:47:33] like I say when you are here it is like
[1:47:36] uh the testimony of the sea you know
[1:47:40] praise God first they said about oh
[1:47:43] Jesus healed this Jesus healed this oh
[1:47:46] you know you see this miracle you see
[1:47:47] this miracle then praise God suddenly
[1:47:51] they have nothing to testify
[1:47:54] fight now become
[1:47:57] quiet
[1:47:59] see that's why sometime in the life of a
[1:48:02] Christian it seems like we know
[1:48:06] everything right like I told you when a
[1:48:09] pastor open the Scripture it seems like
[1:48:11] you know it
[1:48:13] already praise God see I just been
[1:48:18] telling it to the people don't do it
[1:48:20] just move on move on see when you are in
[1:48:24] this area it seems like God is not
[1:48:26] answering your prayer anymore see when
[1:48:29] you are in the outer Court everything is
[1:48:32] very fantastic oh God loves me oh God
[1:48:34] bless me oh God heal me but when you go
[1:48:38] into this area sometimes you are you
[1:48:40] know you are like those Apostle in the
[1:48:43] testimony of the
[1:48:45] sea it seems like God is not answering
[1:48:48] your prayer anymore no he's now watching
[1:48:52] you
[1:48:53] you see what are you going to do praise
[1:48:57] God see just move on don't stop just
[1:49:01] move on so when you are here praise God
[1:49:04] that's why you have a
[1:49:05] pastor okay pastor I feel this way I
[1:49:09] feel that way see and a good pastor will
[1:49:13] always encourage you will always point
[1:49:15] you to to Christ remember that praise
[1:49:19] God hallelujah see see that's why you
[1:49:23] have this altar of
[1:49:26] incense once you go into this place you
[1:49:28] become prayerful you always want to pray
[1:49:31] you always want to pray right oh before
[1:49:34] we start we are going to pray you go to
[1:49:37] praise God amen hallelujah amen
[1:49:41] see praise God but you are only
[1:49:45] here you need to move
[1:49:47] on when you move on there now we have
[1:49:51] that CH kind of Glory
[1:49:53] we call it the supernatural light okay
[1:49:56] praise God here we are we have the
[1:49:58] Heavenly Mana we have the Sho bread and
[1:50:00] then praise the Lord okay there it is
[1:50:04] see here we have the hidden
[1:50:07] Mana see in this area there is only one
[1:50:11] Furniture see the Ark of the Covenant
[1:50:14] amen see but inside that furniture There
[1:50:17] are three things yes okay here you can
[1:50:19] see all the furniture the altar of a
[1:50:22] burnt offering the BR and
[1:50:27] labor excuse
[1:50:33] me that's why when that's why when uh
[1:50:37] you're here then you will go
[1:50:40] in see a lot of people can go into this
[1:50:44] place okay see that's why in this area
[1:50:49] Israel only the chosen people of God can
[1:50:53] go in praise God and Israel is the whole
[1:50:59] country okay that's why a lot of people
[1:51:02] can come into this outer Court in the
[1:51:05] courtyard I mean praise God see but God
[1:51:09] is not there right right here you can
[1:51:14] you can listen to the word of God see
[1:51:17] that's why I've been telling it to the
[1:51:19] people you know if you have a friend if
[1:51:21] they have a have so many
[1:51:24] problem then you approach him you share
[1:51:27] to him the word of God he feel Enlighten
[1:51:31] he said I like it I like where is your
[1:51:34] church now they want to go to the church
[1:51:38] see praise God why because they are
[1:51:41] eating the Heavenly Mana you're sharing
[1:51:44] them the Heavenly Mana praise God
[1:51:47] hallelujah but they are only here the
[1:51:50] the we have Heavenly Mana here we are
[1:51:52] also have Heavenly Mana here the same
[1:51:56] the same food that you're going to eat
[1:51:58] so when you go into this place praise
[1:52:01] God hallelujah all you want to do is to
[1:52:05] listen praise God you don't want to read
[1:52:08] the Bible but when you go in
[1:52:11] here now you you're now interested in
[1:52:15] the reading of the Bible praise God
[1:52:19] hallelujah who's now reading the Bible
[1:52:24] see Hallelujah but then when you go in
[1:52:28] here now we have the hidden Mana amen
[1:52:32] praise God hallelujah see that's why we
[1:52:36] message people we are not satisfied with
[1:52:38] the Heavenly Mana we are not satisfied
[1:52:41] with the UNL Mana we are satisfied we
[1:52:45] you know the only thing that can satisfi
[1:52:48] us is the hidden
[1:52:49] Mana praise God hallelujah yeah
[1:52:54] see that's why when I when I go out into
[1:52:56] the denominational people when we have
[1:52:59] this uh pra seminar I've been telling it
[1:53:02] to them see even the Bible is telling
[1:53:05] you to grow praise God see you know in
[1:53:11] the hidden Mana that is the
[1:53:14] original right then I will ask them this
[1:53:17] question
[1:53:19] okay if Adam blood types is eight
[1:53:24] and Eve came from Adam so his blood must
[1:53:27] be type A
[1:53:29] also
[1:53:30] right see then how come in the whole
[1:53:34] world there are only two major types of
[1:53:38] blood see sometimes you just need to wet
[1:53:41] their
[1:53:42] appetite praise God see how come
[1:53:48] see America suppos USA suppos their
[1:53:52] blood should supposed to be Type
[1:53:54] U right Filipino type f Japan type J see
[1:54:01] in Africa there are so many country
[1:54:04] Ghana type G Nigerian Type
[1:54:06] n but how come that the African people
[1:54:09] can give their blood to the American
[1:54:11] white
[1:54:13] people
[1:54:14] see meaning to say that we come from
[1:54:19] Adam and
[1:54:20] Eve see but the question where is that
[1:54:24] second type of blood come from when
[1:54:26] there are only two people Adam and Eve
[1:54:32] where is that type B come
[1:54:35] from
[1:54:37] Hallelujah see then they will ask the
[1:54:41] question see that is the hidden
[1:54:45] Mana
[1:54:46] Hallelujah see that's why I've been
[1:54:48] telling it to the people it's different
[1:54:50] now sharing the gospel now it's not in
[1:54:54] this area not not Heavenly Mana not sh
[1:54:58] bread
[1:54:59] okay praise God it's about the hidden
[1:55:04] Mana
[1:55:06] now see when you go out you oh God loves
[1:55:09] you everybody knows
[1:55:12] it right when you go out then then you
[1:55:16] will say oh God will bless
[1:55:20] you Hallelujah
[1:55:22] they said oh even our God can bless us
[1:55:26] Buddha can bless us Allah can bless us
[1:55:30] Allelujah what the difference that's why
[1:55:32] the prophet said what is now the
[1:55:34] difference between you and
[1:55:36] them see they have the same God that can
[1:55:39] bless them you have the same God you
[1:55:41] know
[1:55:43] Hallelujah see that's why in our age is
[1:55:46] different the way we share the message
[1:55:49] is different now see when we go out when
[1:55:53] we share like brother Paul said we study
[1:55:56] the seven Church ages when I go out I've
[1:55:59] been asking them you know when you go
[1:56:01] into that denominational churches they
[1:56:03] will ask you what you're going to preach
[1:56:06] see they will not just let you
[1:56:08] preach
[1:56:10] see they will you know they will
[1:56:14] investigate praise God when they asked
[1:56:17] me what are you going to preach I said
[1:56:21] I'm going to preach about
[1:56:24] history Hallelujah see the seven Church
[1:56:28] the history of
[1:56:30] Christianity see then you will start
[1:56:32] sharing them the seven Church ages see
[1:56:36] praise God that is the hidden
[1:56:39] Mana praise God that's why the the
[1:56:42] message believer you know like I've been
[1:56:45] always saying that that's why the
[1:56:46] prophet said you cannot you cannot uh uh
[1:56:49] preach uh to the message people people
[1:56:52] this wishy-washy you
[1:56:55] know praise God see Mage minister they
[1:56:59] they they
[1:57:00] study right praise God before they come
[1:57:04] to the church they pray then they study
[1:57:06] they
[1:57:08] Hallelujah see because a message people
[1:57:11] they are very
[1:57:13] demanding that's a problem
[1:57:16] Hallelujah see amen praise
[1:57:20] God hallelujah but but like I'm saying
[1:57:23] you know there's a lot of thing that we
[1:57:25] we we can share we can tell we can
[1:57:27] preach in the message amen praise God
[1:57:30] this is this is just very basic okay I'm
[1:57:34] just telling you praise that you need we
[1:57:36] need to grow okay this is good for the
[1:57:39] young people in that way you will
[1:57:41] understand where you where you are where
[1:57:43] you're standing see because sometimes
[1:57:46] they thought that oh I'm born again no
[1:57:49] not yet maybe you are here maybe you're
[1:57:51] here
[1:57:53] see praise God hallelujah born again
[1:57:56] will happen in this area amen praise God
[1:58:00] see that's why you know the the the rod
[1:58:03] of

[1:58:07] Covenant the rod of Aeron that is a dead
[1:58:10] Rod but it's it bed amen then it bring
[1:58:14] fruits amen praise God hallelujah see
[1:58:20] hallelujah look

[1:58:26] this area only the lits see the liit
[1:58:30] they are anointed they are uh they are
[1:58:33] Sanctified okay praise God that's why
[1:58:36] when you got Sanctified you are now in
[1:58:38] this
[1:58:39] area like the Levites but then like I
[1:58:43] told you they will change their clothes
[1:58:45] their robe special robe they are going
[1:58:48] to wear a robe that cannot you know if
[1:58:52] you sweat you
[1:58:53] die praise God see that's why some
[1:58:57] sisters some brothers said oh the sister
[1:59:00] will say oh I cannot oh praise God I
[1:59:04] want still wants to cut their hair he
[1:59:06] still want to put makeup and the brother
[1:59:08] also now praise God hallelujah before
[1:59:11] you know you you don't tell to to to to
[1:59:14] to the brother not to wear an earring
[1:59:17] but today you need to you need to tell
[1:59:20] it to them also don't we earring
[1:59:22] Brothers see before you're just telling
[1:59:25] it to the W to the sister Hallelujah see
[1:59:30] praise God then sometimes the sister oh
[1:59:32] I cannot do it I cannot do it Hallelujah
[1:59:36] see you don't you don't need to do it
[1:59:38] like I told you like like when God took
[1:59:41] that out of me about the cursing see
[1:59:45] Allelujah he took it out I did not I did
[1:59:49] not stop it amen okay he took it out
[1:59:53] praise God see no
[1:59:56] sweat
[1:59:58] okay praise God if you're still
[2:00:01] sweating to live a holy
[2:00:04] life you die amen praise God
[2:00:10] see
[2:00:14] Hallelujah but then you will know it
[2:00:17] praise God once you go inside that Holy
[2:00:20] of holy place
[2:00:22] see your life will just be
[2:00:26] Sanctified that's why I've been telling
[2:00:28] you know when I was uh in one country
[2:00:30] the Pastor said you know brother N I
[2:00:32] listen to you see I've been telling it
[2:00:34] to the people I've been telling it to
[2:00:36] the sister don't cut their hair see
[2:00:39] don't put makeup but they are sin doing
[2:00:42] it I told to the brother you know the
[2:00:46] only thing you need to do is just to
[2:00:48] share them the message amen see amen
[2:00:52] was see that's why when I go out on the
[2:00:55] mission field I know if the pastor is
[2:00:57] preaching the message or not amen see
[2:01:02] because if you if they teach the message
[2:01:04] to the people the message will going to
[2:01:07] produce the S
[2:01:09] justification will produce the
[2:01:12] sanctification say will produce the
[2:01:14] baptism of the Holy
[2:01:16] Ghost see you don't need to go out and
[2:01:20] preach about justification or
[2:01:22] sanctification just preach the message
[2:01:26] and it will bear fruit of justification
[2:01:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:31] unto
[2:01:33] adoption see praise God
[2:01:37] hallelujah
[2:01:39] see so once you go into that holy of
[2:01:42] holies now you are in the presence of
[2:01:45] God see you know like the prophet said
[2:01:50] that wall
[2:01:51] that curtain is so thick that you can
[2:01:55] hear anything outside of that uh room
[2:01:58] amen see you are in the presence of God
[2:02:02] and you know when you are in this area
[2:02:05] you're doing a lot of things see you
[2:02:09] bring the animal you kill the animal and
[2:02:11] you do this and you do that then when
[2:02:13] you when you go into this holy Place
[2:02:16] praise God you're still doing
[2:02:19] something you will light the you will
[2:02:22] clean the you know the Seven Candle
[2:02:25] Stick the the the the shoe bread and
[2:02:27] this but a little bit
[2:02:31] lighter right but when you go to the
[2:02:34] holy of holies you are not going to do
[2:02:38] anything you will just sit there in the
[2:02:41] presence of God and then you will eat a
[2:02:44] handful of hidden Manana you'll just eat
[2:02:47] there eat and
[2:02:49] eat Hallelujah see see that's why the
[2:02:52] prophet said you know Christianity is
[2:02:55] based upon
[2:02:57] rest see praise God when you go inside
[2:03:01] that uh in that holy of holies you're
[2:03:04] not going to do anything
[2:03:07] anymore see Hallelujah that's why Paul
[2:03:10] said it is not me it is him right
[2:03:14] greater is he that's in me than he that
[2:03:16] is in the world praise God
[2:03:19] hallelujah see
[2:03:22] praise the Lord hallelujah so the this
[2:03:25] is what the prophet said okay we're
[2:03:28] almost done says here on the outside
[2:03:32] there what light did they have they had
[2:03:34] the light of the stars at night okay see
[2:03:38] okay here we have the Levites here we
[2:03:41] have one
[2:03:42] nation then in the Holy place there is
[2:03:45] only one tribes but then in the holy of
[2:03:48] holies there is only one person amen see
[2:03:52] it's getting fewer and fewer and fewer
[2:03:56] see praise God that's why what can we do
[2:04:00] that is the that is the shadow okay
[2:04:04] praise God see that's why they are
[2:04:06] saying oh you're just few
[2:04:10] amen because according to the shadow
[2:04:14] only one person can go into the holy of
[2:04:18] holies right praise God but thank be to
[2:04:21] God if God will add more soul to this
[2:04:23] church okay we are not against it also
[2:04:26] but even though God will F this with
[2:04:30] people still we are still in
[2:04:32] minority see even if you get all the
[2:04:36] number of in the whole world the message
[2:04:39] people my goodness we are still just a
[2:04:42] small number compared to those religious
[2:04:46] group okay praise God hallelujah see one
[2:04:51] nation one tribes one
[2:04:54] person praise God hallelujah see now
[2:04:57] this is what the prophet said on the
[2:04:59] outside what light did they have they
[2:05:01] had the light of the stars and night the
[2:05:03] light of the Moon they had the light of
[2:05:06] the sun any kind of the cloud could come
[2:05:08] over and upset the whole thing they
[2:05:11] could not see how to walk the night
[2:05:14] sometimes Cloud shut out of the moon and
[2:05:16] stars at daytime the sun won't shine for
[2:05:19] days and weeks that's the way the
[2:05:20] experience is out y That's right let
[2:05:24] little trouble comes up and you
[2:05:27] backslide where were you you were just
[2:05:30] out the outside that's right see a
[2:05:34] little trouble you backslide a little
[2:05:36] trouble you will not come to the church
[2:05:38] anymore oh I will just stay home see
[2:05:42] right live
[2:05:44] streaming Hallelujah see there is
[2:05:48] something about the church amen you know
[2:05:51] when the pandemic hit
[2:05:53] us the moment the moment our government
[2:05:58] close everything we are already on live
[2:06:02] streaming we never stop see and I told
[2:06:06] you brother I enjoy it amen
[2:06:10] yeah you don't need to be here to to uh
[2:06:14] to how to Hur you know because you're
[2:06:18] already there at home that's right see
[2:06:22] my children will set set up all this uh
[2:06:25] video C and everything praise God
[2:06:28] hallelujah then you will you will just
[2:06:30] stand in front of that camera and finish
[2:06:35] and after we
[2:06:37] done it's so
[2:06:40] nice
[2:06:43] see then when the government open up I
[2:06:47] said Lord you know we are we we rent we
[2:06:51] are renting a
[2:06:52] place
[2:06:54] see that's why I tell it to my people I
[2:06:57] tell it I'm asking the Lord so if we can
[2:07:00] if it can be done like that what we are
[2:07:04] trying what we are going to do I said
[2:07:07] Lord we're just going to have this uh
[2:07:11] online service and then once a month
[2:07:14] we're going to rent a place then
[2:07:16] everybody can come in that way we can
[2:07:19] save a lot of money
[2:07:22] see in that way the church will not be
[2:07:27] burdened see but the Bible is very clear
[2:07:31] don't forsake the
[2:07:33] assembly see because the it is where God
[2:07:37] will are are training us it is where God

[2:21:54] amen hallelujah who enjoyed that
[2:22:01] tonight I believe we heard from
[2:22:04] God some people might have heard from
[2:22:06] Brother Nestor but some people
[2:22:09] definitely heard from
[2:22:11] God so many points that we could talk
[2:22:14] about I I don't really want
[2:22:16] to even though I do want to preach it's
[2:22:19] only quarter after 8
[2:22:22] my I don't want to keep us tonight we
[2:22:24] have service tomorrow but you know
[2:22:27] brothers and sisters I think it's just a
[2:22:29] beautiful beautiful description we heard
[2:22:31] tonight about the
[2:22:33] Tabernacle and there's no shortcuts as a
[2:22:36] Christian we all have to come in from
[2:22:39] the outside Wilderness into the outer
[2:22:42] Court we have to identify with that
[2:22:45] sacrifice we've got to feel the life
[2:22:48] leave our sacrifice
[2:22:51] identify with that life that was in that
[2:22:53] animal with our
[2:22:55] lamb but then we've got to go into that
[2:22:58] Holy place and and our brother said it
[2:23:01] he touched on it I'm probably going to
[2:23:02] preach on this as we go forwards but
[2:23:04] many people get stuck in there they
[2:23:07] believe God's done so much for them and
[2:23:09] he has but we can't stay
[2:23:13] there it's
[2:23:15] man-made it's God ordained but it's
[2:23:17] still man-made we've got to go all the
[2:23:19] way into
[2:23:21] Christ we've got to get away from all
[2:23:23] the artificial and the one that really
[2:23:24] hit me tonight was so good it goes Al
[2:23:27] along with what I was talking about how
[2:23:29] many people get so offended in the
[2:23:31] message in churches oh my I'm offended
[2:23:35] you know when you get in behind that
