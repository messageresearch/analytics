[37:54] thara write these things sayith the Son
[37:57] of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[38:01] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[38:05] brass I Know Thy works and charity and
[38:08] service and faith and thy patience and
[38:11] thy works and the last to be more than
[38:15] the first not withstanding I have a few
[38:18] things against thee because thou
[38:19] sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[38:21] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[38:24] and to seduce my servants to commit
[38:26] fornication
[38:28] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[38:31] and I gave her space to repent of her
[38:34] fornication and she repented not behold
[38:38] I will cast her into a bed and them that
[38:41] commit adultery with her into Great
[38:44] Tribulation except they repent of their
[38:47] deeds and I will kill her children with
[38:50] death and all the churches shall know
[38:53] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[38:57] and
[38:58] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[39:01] you according to your
[39:02] works but unto you I say and unto the
[39:06] rest in
[39:07] thota as many as have not this
[39:11] Doctrine and which have not known the
[39:13] depths of Satan as they speak I will put
[39:17] upon you none other burden but that
[39:21] which ye have already hold fast till I
[39:24] come and he that overcometh and keepeth
[39:27] my words unto the end to him will I give
[39:30] power over the Nations and he shall rule
[39:34] them with a rod of iron as the vessels
[39:36] of a Potter shall they be broken to
[39:39] Shivers even as I received of my father
[39:43] and I will give him the Morning
[39:46] Star he that hath an ear let him hear
[39:50] what the spirit saith unto the churches

[40:31] bless you tonight you may be
[40:37] seated I just had this on my heart and
[40:41] uh I just thought I'd read it I hope
[40:43] it's
[40:45] okay it's out of the exposition of the
[40:48] seven Church
[40:50] ages if anybody out there is going
[40:54] through something maybe it'll be for you
[40:56] tonight
[40:57] the cloudy skies and storms of
[41:00] life are no signs of God's
[41:04] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[41:06] Still
[41:08] Waters signs of his love and
[41:12] approval so we can't look at this life
[41:15] the natural events the circumstances
[41:18] surrounding us and say God is with us or
[41:21] that God isn't with us based on the
[41:24] natural events that we see
[41:27] his approval of any of us is only in the
[41:33] Beloved his love is elective which he
[41:36] had for us before the foundation of the
[41:39] world and does he love us ah
[41:42] yes but how shall we
[41:45] know we shall know because he said
[41:49] so and he manifested that he did love us
[41:53] for he brought us to himself how many of
[41:56] us brought ourselves to
[41:59] him he brought us to
[42:03] himself sorry one second
[42:06] here Oh my he brought us to himself and
[42:09] gave us of his Spirit placing us as
[42:14] Sons speaks of adoption doesn't
[42:17] it and how shall I prove my love to him
[42:20] how shall I prove that I'm placed as a
[42:23] son how shall I prove that I'm adopted
[42:26] how shall I prove that I actually love
[42:29] him other than just saying flippantly
[42:31] that I love you Lord how shall I prove
[42:33] that how shall I prove my love to him by
[42:39] believing what he said and not just
[42:42] believing it it can be pretty easy to
[42:44] believe it but when we believe something
[42:47] we actually begin to act like we believe
[42:50] it is that right and how shall I prove
[42:53] my love to him by believing what he said
[42:56] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[43:00] the trials that he in his wisdom allows
[43:04] to come to
[43:05] pass I just think that's such a
[43:07] beautiful thought it came to me real
[43:11] strong before service and I thought I
[43:13] better read it if that's the case maybe
[43:16] someone's going through something maybe
[43:18] we have circumstances and situations
[43:20] brothers and sisters he loves us and how
[43:24] do we show our love back to him we just
[43:26] conduct ourselves
[43:27] with joy amidst our our lives and the
[43:30] trials that we're going through God
[43:33] bless you tonight that was for free just
[43:36] like to welcome back all those who were
[43:37] traveling brother Toby he was traveling
[43:40] to Florida he took some services at
[43:42] Brother Joseph Underwoods God bless you
[43:44] brother brother Emanuel is back from the
[43:46] UK he was at his brother's funeral and

[43:57] certainly miss everyone when they do go
[43:59] away and uh I do apologize for my
[44:02] behavior over the last week or two I've
[44:04] been a little bit out of it with the the
[44:07] surgery and the medication that I was on
[44:09] it was a bit much and I'm certainly
[44:11] thankful I'm not on that medication
[44:13] anymore and uh Lord willing I will never
[44:16] do it
[44:17] again but you know uh it's important to
[44:20] take it the right time and just enough
[44:22] to get you through I guess it's all
[44:24] about pain management and it helped it
[44:26] worked
[44:27] but I'm back so God bless you tonight we
[44:31] have a prayer meeting tomorrow night at
[44:32] 7:30 for those who can come we know it's
[44:34] always a blessing we have the singles
[44:37] weekend coming up this weekend we've got
[44:40] the youth event on Sunday the 20th I
[44:42] believe it is after service and I just
[44:45] wanted to mention that we do have the uh
[44:47] ongoing vote for the church officers it
[44:50] is actually going to close at 11:59 p.m.
[44:54] on October the 4th and uh if if you
[44:57] haven't received uh an email with a
[45:00] ballot in there by all means just reach
[45:02] out and let me know um just wanted to
[45:05] make sure that we're clear there are
[45:07] requirements there are conditions to be
[45:10] able to vote in this uh election and any
[45:13] election that happens in the assembly
[45:15] you first have to be tithe paying and
[45:18] offerings paying tithes and offerings
[45:20] you have to attend a minimum of three
[45:23] months to qualify you have to be in
[45:26] regular attendance to be able to qualify
[45:29] and you need to be over 18 years of age
[45:32] to qualify and uh it says in the bylaws
[45:35] for the uh for the uh assembly that if a
[45:38] man is married and he meets these
[45:40] requirements then his wife automatically
[45:42] qualifies to vote as well so I do
[45:45] believe we have followed all of that
[45:47] criteria if you have any questions or
[45:49] concerns by all means just uh reach out
[45:52] and we can talk about it are you happy
[45:55] tonight amen certainly thankful for this
[45:58] study the exposition of the seven Church
[46:00] ages you know I've heard it said a few
[46:03] different times and maybe a couple
[46:04] different ways how this study just sets
[46:07] the church in order the exposition of
[46:09] the seven Church ages is the essence of
[46:11] the message of the hour the purity of it
[46:14] all of it condensed into one one book
[46:17] which is uh a real real neat thing if
[46:20] you ever could uh condense the message
[46:23] into one book that is I think this would
[46:26] be it
[46:27] um last time we talked we uh were in the
[46:31] thyrian church age I believe we started
[46:33] it and uh we covered the the story of St
[46:37] Patrick and how he trained dogs and how
[46:40] St Patrick was not um the messenger for
[46:44] the age it was
[46:45] Columba and uh the thyrian
[46:49] age uh is just such an interesting study
[46:52] of the word because we know that it is
[46:55] uh it's not a good age it is the uh the
[47:00] ruling of a woman over a man and uh
[47:03] that's what thot tyrian is dominating
[47:06] female and uh you know when the church
[47:09] gets to dominating over the ministry or
[47:12] over the word there's a problem there's
[47:15] politics and that's really what brother
[47:16] brandham gets into here with this um I
[47:19] think it's just wonderful to hear though
[47:21] just sort of recapping kind of uh maybe
[47:24] we didn't maybe I'll just start here in
[47:26] paragraph 2 four of the of uh the thot
[47:29] tyrian Church age talking about uh
[47:32] Columba when he went and uh he was
[47:35] dealing with some uh some authoritarians
[47:39] that were not willing to talk to him and
[47:42] uh you
[47:43] know he actually just preached the
[47:45] gospel and by preaching the gospel he he
[47:48] won many to the Lord in paragraph 24 it
[47:51] says on another occasion when he was
[47:52] also shut out from a village as he
[47:55] turned away to depart the son of the
[47:57] chief suddenly became violently ill even
[47:59] unto death St Columbo was quickly sought
[48:02] after and
[48:03] recalled people know who to call in
[48:06] their hour of trial don't they even
[48:10] unbelievers when he prayed the prayer of
[48:12] faith the boy was instantly healed The
[48:15] Village was then open to evangelization
[48:18] by the gospel you know brothers and
[48:21] sisters I talked about it a while ago in
[48:23] uh my own life and if I had a Ministry
[48:26] or whatever we'd want to call it for the
[48:29] longest time I thought there needed to
[48:30] be a certain thing in my life and and
[48:33] you know maybe done in a certain way and
[48:35] and when you pray that prayer of faith
[48:37] that way then God will come on the scene
[48:40] but you know it's not up to us to get
[48:42] God to come on the scene it's up to us
[48:45] to Simply Pray when Believers real
[48:48] Believers genuine Believers pray God's
[48:51] listening and he comes on the scene and
[48:53] backs up his own word it's not up to us
[48:55] to try and bring him to come on the
[48:57] scene he's just waiting to come on the
[48:59] scene carrying on in paragraph 25 I
[49:02] think this is where we left off last
[49:04] time the pure gospel that was preached
[49:06] by Columba and his fellow workers spread
[49:09] over the whole of Scotland turning it to
[49:12] God it also overflowed into Ireland and
[49:15] over northern Europe his means of
[49:19] spreading the gospel was one wherein
[49:21] perhaps 12 men under a leader would go
[49:24] into a new area and literally build a
[49:27] gospel centered Town amongst these 12
[49:31] men would be Carpenters teachers
[49:33] preachers Etc all wonderfully versed in
[49:38] the word and holy living I love that
[49:41] part not just wonderfully versed in the
[49:44] word but wonderfully versed in the word
[49:47] and the action the action to the vision
[49:50] that we heard about on Sunday the holy
[49:53] living this little colony was enclosed
[49:56] by a wall soon this enclosure would be
[49:59] surrounded by students and their
[50:00] families in their own homes learning the
[50:02] word and preparing to go out and serve
[50:04] the Lord as missionaries leaders and
[50:07] preachers the men were free to marry
[50:09] though many did not in order to serve
[50:12] God the better they remained free from
[50:16] State help and thereby thereby steered
[50:18] clear of politics instead of ever
[50:22] attacking other religions they taught
[50:24] the truth for they belied
[50:27] that the truth was weapon enough to
[50:30] accomplish the ends that God had in mind
[50:32] for
[50:33] them just try and argue hey try and
[50:36] argue the people that want to come
[50:38] against the message of the hour they'll
[50:40] always tie us up they'll always be just
[50:42] a little bit smarter but if we just
[50:44] preach the word if we just say the word
[50:47] the word does all the Sorting we don't
[50:48] need to worry about that at all they
[50:51] were absolutely independent of Rome St
[50:55] Columbo was the founder of a great Bible
[50:57] school on the I island of high off the
[50:59] Southwest coast of Scotland when he went
[51:03] there the island was so Barren and Rocky
[51:06] that it could not bear enough food for
[51:08] them all isn't this beautiful but
[51:11] Columba planted seed with one hand while
[51:15] he held the other Aloft in prayer today
[51:18] the island is one of the most fertile in
[51:21] the
[51:21] world from this Bible centered Island
[51:24] went forth Mighty Scholars endowed with
[51:26] wisdom and the power of God when I read
[51:30] the history of this great servant of God
[51:33] and the wonderful work he did it
[51:35] saddened my heart to find that the papal
[51:38] power lusting to bring all men into its
[51:42] grasp came and eventually defiled these
[51:45] Mission fields and destroyed the truth
[51:49] as it was taught by
[51:51] Columba it is not uh it is not just a
[51:54] simple thing for people to actually be
[51:56] able to get the word and believe the
[51:58] word the devil is coming around as a
[52:00] roaring lion we know that Vision that
[52:02] brother brandham had it's such a good
[52:04] one and it just sort of coincides with
[52:05] this story of Columba planting seed with
[52:09] one hand and praying with the other one
[52:11] we know brother Ram saw that vision of
[52:13] the man in white going around on dis
[52:16] Fields he was talking about where the
[52:18] Earth was turned it was readied soil to
[52:21] accept seed but then what happened the
[52:24] man dressed in black the Sinister one
[52:27] came around behind him and actually SED
[52:30] tears amongst all the good seed that's
[52:32] what the devil is doing that's what the
[52:34] devil does and how do how does he do it
[52:36] he does it with words just with words
[52:38] that's all it is
[52:40] words he's pretty Sly the salutation
[52:45] Revelations 2:18 these things saith the
[52:47] Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[52:51] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[52:55] brass I just think this is such an
[52:57] amazing scripture myself when I look at
[52:59] this this does not paint the picture of
[53:01] a Dodie old grandpa does it this Paints
[53:04] the picture of the king of kings and
[53:07] Lord of lords the just one who will
[53:09] recompense for all that is done in this
[53:13] age in in all the ages the revelation of
[53:16] the godhead to the thot tyrian age is
[53:19] that Jesus is the son of God once in the
[53:23] days of his flesh he was known as the
[53:26] son of man but henceforth we know him no
[53:29] more after the flesh he is no longer the
[53:32] son of man the great prophet who in
[53:36] himself gathered together all prophecies
[53:39] the only begotten is back in the bosom
[53:42] of the father now we know him after the
[53:46] power of the resurrection and isn't that
[53:49] beautiful because we don't know him of
[53:50] the power of the Resurrection in the
[53:51] story about Easter 2,000 years ago we
[53:53] know about the power of the Resurrection
[53:54] in our lives and homes and families here
[53:57] today he is alive he's risen and has
[54:00] taken unto himself his mighty power and
[54:03] is above all and overall to the praise
[54:06] of his own Glory that's so beautiful his
[54:09] glory he will not share with another his
[54:13] leadership over the church he will not
[54:16] surrender to any man there ain't no
[54:20] Bishops there ain't no Cardinals there
[54:22] ain't no Vicor to
[54:24] Christ but there's Christ
[54:29] he looks down upon thyra and here he
[54:31] sees in that City and in that fourth age
[54:35] the honor which belongs to him alone
[54:38] bestowed upon
[54:41] another his eyes Blaze with the fire of
[54:45] Wrath and judgment as he sees Apollo
[54:49] revered as the Son of God when he alone
[54:53] is the only begotten of the father how
[54:55] awful must must be his judgment upon the
[54:58] religion of the thot tyan age wherein
[55:01] the church members are like the Pagan
[55:05] worshippers of the Son of God Apollo the
[55:09] son of Zeus elevate a human ruler to
[55:13] adoration backed by the power of the
[55:17] state and that's why I just have to
[55:19] pause there brothers and sisters and and
[55:21] mention it we all know it but sometimes
[55:24] maybe it's just good to remember
[55:26] that's why God will not allow any
[55:29] Ministry to get raised up if people
[55:31] start getting their eyes on a man good
[55:33] or bad there will be a situation that
[55:36] will take that man out of the way
[55:38] because God won't share his glory with
[55:40] nobody not with
[55:42] anyone brother Ram goes on to say for
[55:44] that is exactly what he saw the Roman
[55:47] Catholic Church fully immersed in idol
[55:49] worship based upon rights of the son god
[55:53] Apollo had elevated a man to act ual
[55:56] deity Pope through the marriage of the
[56:01] church to the
[56:03] state for Thomas aquinus and
[56:07] alveris Pelagius formulated and stated
[56:11] that the pope seems to those who view
[56:14] him with the spiritual eye to be not a
[56:19] man but a
[56:20] God that just makes it idol worship
[56:23] right there idolatry immediately there
[56:25] are no bounds to his
[56:28] authority goodness he can declare to be
[56:31] right what he will and can take away
[56:35] from any their rights as he sees fit and
[56:40] and that is actually it's on the road
[56:43] today to doubt this Universal Power
[56:47] leads to being shut out from Salvation
[56:51] And even today even in the message you
[56:53] can hear people that take it and spin it
[56:54] their own way and say say if you don't
[56:56] believe it that the way I believe it
[56:58] then you're going to go to hell you're
[56:59] going to burn in hell how could anybody
[57:01] who is a believer of this word ever ever
[57:05] say those words to doubt this Universal
[57:08] Power leads to being shut out from
[57:09] salvation
[57:12] goodness the great enemies of the church
[57:16] are the Heretics who will not wear the
[57:19] Yoke of true obedience and that's
[57:21] definitely Us in the way in which you
[57:23] call heresy We Will Not Bow Down and
[57:25] Worship the Pope will we we ain't going
[57:27] to kiss the ring it ain't going to
[57:28] happen 1 Timothy 2:5 there is one
[57:32] mediator between God and Men the man
[57:35] Jesus Christ the son of
[57:38] God but the pope of Rome has changed the
[57:43] word isn't that just exactly like Satan
[57:47] just exactly like the Garden of Eden
[57:48] just just changed the word just a little
[57:50] bit right just a little
[57:53] bit how he made it one mediator between
[57:57] God and man not men so now he mediates
[58:01] between the mediator and Men those
[58:04] middle managers my but there is none
[58:08] other mediator save the son the pope
[58:11] pronounces salvation through the Church
[58:13] of Rome but there is no salvation except
[58:16] through the Son of God no wonder the
[58:19] eyes blaze in fiery judgment no wonder
[58:23] the feet are like fine brass as he
[58:25] stands ready to trample into powder and
[58:28] dust the wicked kingdoms of this world
[58:32] thank God for those strong feet of brass
[58:36] they have passed through the Judgment
[58:38] for us amen they are now our foundation
[58:42] for what he gained is ours we stand
[58:46] identified in him Jesus the son of God
[58:50] it was in this age that we witness the
[58:53] rise of
[58:56] interesting you know when brother bam
[58:57] talks about
[58:59] muhammadislam
[59:02] muhammadislam it was in this age that we
[59:04] witness the rise of
[59:26] image about their Prophet Muhammad right
[59:30] now I'm not trying to throw off on him
[59:32] now but we know what's happened in this
[59:34] world it's terrible if people try and
[59:37] mock them they come and kill them even
[59:40] today it was also in this age that the
[59:43] false Church defied the first
[59:46] commandment of almighty God and launched
[59:48] swiftly into breaking the second
[59:50] commandment for it put its Pope in the
[59:53] place of Jesus Christ and established
[59:55] and enfor forced idol worship to such an
[59:58] extent that it meant death to those who
[1:00:01] refused who refused the icons of place
[1:00:04] within the church under Empress Theodora
[1:00:08] alone from 842 to 867 over 100,000
[1:00:14] saints were killed because they reputed
[1:00:18] the images of no
[1:00:20] value surely this age must repent or
[1:00:24] lose all there stands the Lord of glory
[1:00:28] god very God his word cast aside his
[1:00:33] person rejected but human hands and
[1:00:36] human hearts cannot depose him let them
[1:00:40] deny him he remaineth faithful fear not
[1:00:44] little flock it's your father's good
[1:00:46] pleasure to give you the kingdom and
[1:00:49] when I come with feet of brass and
[1:00:52] flaming eyes I will recompense judgment
[1:00:56] is mine I will repay sayith the lord
[1:01:00] it's interesting how this is written
[1:01:02] because I personally believe you go
[1:01:05] between the man the prophet and the Lord
[1:01:08] Jesus not saying this is the word of God
[1:01:10] but I'm saying there's a man inspired to
[1:01:14] speak the eulogy Revelations 2:19 I Know
[1:01:18] Thy works and love and service and faith
[1:01:21] and thy patience and thy works and the
[1:01:23] last to be more than the first
[1:01:27] here again we find the same introductory
[1:01:29] remarks I Know Thy works the Son of God
[1:01:33] himself said believe me for the very
[1:01:36] Works sake he put an emphasis on his own
[1:01:41] Works while on Earth The Works that he
[1:01:44] did were ordained of God to inspire
[1:01:47] faith in
[1:01:49] him it was a great part of his
[1:01:52] ministry his holy spirit in the first
[1:01:56] Apostle Paul said in Ephesians
[1:01:59] 2:10 for we are as workmanship created
[1:02:03] in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:02:06] works which God hath ordained that we
[1:02:09] should walk in
[1:02:11] them I really like that scripture and I
[1:02:13] just kind of took a look at it tonight I
[1:02:15] think there's I think there's something
[1:02:16] in there just a little nugget paragraph
[1:02:19] 36 these Works were to inspire faith in
[1:02:22] him as they would show forth the
[1:02:26] relationship to him that Paul described
[1:02:29] as created in him now works will never
[1:02:33] take the place of faith in God for our
[1:02:38] salvation but works will show forth our
[1:02:42] faith already placed in
[1:02:45] him this is this is a real nugget here
[1:02:49] this this uh couple of paragraphs here
[1:02:52] Works don't actually show that that
[1:02:56] we're saved our Salvation is not based
[1:02:59] on works and we know the church many
[1:03:01] churches have based salvation upon works
[1:03:04] the more works you do the more saved you
[1:03:05] get the more family members you can save
[1:03:08] etc etc brother Bram he says here good
[1:03:11] works won't save you but they will come
[1:03:14] forth out of a saved life as fruit unto
[1:03:17] the Lord you don't have to tell people
[1:03:19] certain things in their lives when we
[1:03:21] get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when he
[1:03:25] singular
[1:03:26] the spirit of truth comes Jesus Christ
[1:03:29] the word this one with eyes flaming as
[1:03:32] fire and feet as brass when he comes
[1:03:34] into our lives he leads us and guides us
[1:03:38] into all truth he shows us what he likes
[1:03:41] and he shows us what he doesn't like in
[1:03:43] our
[1:03:44] lives and if we've truly met him then we
[1:03:47] listen to him and we change our lives we
[1:03:50] change our minds we don't actually
[1:03:52] continue on I love what how brother B
[1:03:54] brother mvin brought it on on Sunday the
[1:03:57] Masterpiece family and and the one part
[1:03:59] in there he talked about repenting it it
[1:04:01] means to change our mind that's what
[1:04:03] repentance means is to change our mind
[1:04:06] but what happens is it doesn't just
[1:04:07] change our mind and we can have a cup of
[1:04:09] coffee with friends and say Amen I've
[1:04:11] just changed my mind I've repented no
[1:04:15] what it does is it changes our
[1:04:17] actions if we've truly repented if we
[1:04:20] haven't truly repented then we go on the
[1:04:23] cycle and our actions don't change and
[1:04:25] we we continue on there's still
[1:04:27] something in our life that we need to
[1:04:28] get rid of and you know brothers and
[1:04:30] sisters I just think it's important for
[1:04:32] us to actually speak straight about
[1:04:34] these things because these are devils
[1:04:36] that like to get in our lives and and
[1:04:38] try and make us think that we're saved
[1:04:40] and everything is good when really we're
[1:04:41] not when things are not good because the
[1:04:44] action doesn't show that it's good I say
[1:04:47] Lord help
[1:04:49] me when we repent we change our mind
[1:04:52] which changes our actions
[1:04:56] good works won't save us good works
[1:04:58] won't save me good works won't save you
[1:05:01] but they will come forth out of a saved
[1:05:03] life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in
[1:05:08] Good Works he says even if a man is not
[1:05:10] saved he ought to do good works and do
[1:05:14] the best he
[1:05:16] can what is horrible in the sight of God
[1:05:20] is for men to do evil
[1:05:22] works and then say they are doing the
[1:05:25] will of the Lord
[1:05:27] Lord help us Lord that is what the
[1:05:30] Bishops and popes and the hierarchy of
[1:05:32] Rome were doing and are doing they were
[1:05:35] killing maming and doing all manner of
[1:05:38] evil in the name of the Lord they lived
[1:05:40] out lives exactly opposite to what the
[1:05:42] world
[1:05:43] teaches now we wouldn't have to look
[1:05:46] very far or talk to very many people to
[1:05:49] hear and and ask if the Catholic church
[1:05:51] just the Catholic Church specifically
[1:05:54] and I don't mean to throw off on them
[1:05:55] but just just to say that what he read
[1:05:57] here what we read here what he was
[1:05:59] saying there back then is still
[1:06:01] happening now how can there be all these
[1:06:03] different news items these situations
[1:06:07] that happen to to families and children
[1:06:10] and and there seems to be nothing that
[1:06:11] happens there's no court of
[1:06:14] appeal the bishop or the Cardinal just
[1:06:16] goes to a new posting somewhere
[1:06:19] else how does that
[1:06:21] happen they lived out lives exactly
[1:06:24] opposite to what the word teaches in
[1:06:27] that evil day those True Believers sha
[1:06:30] like a light in a dark place I just love
[1:06:35] that because it's the same today
[1:06:36] brothers and sisters those Believers
[1:06:38] shine like a light in the dark place as
[1:06:41] they continually did good they returned
[1:06:45] cursing with blessing and did the truth
[1:06:50] to honor God even though many died for
[1:06:54] it it's seems like maybe it would be
[1:06:58] easier to do that if our lives were on
[1:07:00] the line if we knew that we're going to
[1:07:01] get fed to lions and so on and so forth
[1:07:04] maybe we would be a little more
[1:07:06] committed sometimes to just do truth and
[1:07:08] and to be honest and and to be upright
[1:07:11] and to live our lives according to the
[1:07:13] gospel but because we don't have that
[1:07:15] that great thing it's just sort of a a
[1:07:17] gray area in the lives of a Christian
[1:07:20] and I guarantee you that Satan knows
[1:07:21] that and he loves that because it gives
[1:07:23] him a place to hide it gives gives them
[1:07:25] an opportunity to mess with people's
[1:07:27] minds where they think they're doing
[1:07:29] good when they're really not doing good
[1:07:31] because you know what guilty of the
[1:07:32] least is guilty of the
[1:07:34] whole I want to ask a question tonight
[1:07:37] uh which is worse which is worse
[1:07:39] brothers and sisters a little white lie
[1:07:43] or a terrible vicious lie which one of
[1:07:46] those is
[1:07:48] worse
[1:07:51] anybody they're all the
[1:07:54] same Sin is
[1:07:56] Sin truth is
[1:07:58] truth a lie is a
[1:08:01] lie it's true or it's not true there's
[1:08:04] good and there's evil there's sin and
[1:08:07] there's Holiness
[1:08:12] Amen in this verse he's commending his
[1:08:16] children because they were living
[1:08:19] changed lives they weren't living
[1:08:21] according to the way they were according
[1:08:24] to the the people that were there all
[1:08:27] the churches that were happening their
[1:08:29] Works testified to a new spirit
[1:08:34] where
[1:08:36] within not in their
[1:08:38] church not in their
[1:08:41] Association not in their
[1:08:44] tenure their Works testified to a new
[1:08:48] spirit
[1:08:49] within men saw their good works and
[1:08:52] glorified God people read them because
[1:08:56] they were written Epistles right read of
[1:09:01] all men we know that we can preach but
[1:09:04] you know what our lives speak way louder
[1:09:06] than our our words
[1:09:09] do we can say children I don't want to
[1:09:12] see you do that I don't want to see that
[1:09:15] happening I I don't want to see you
[1:09:17] doing that children but then as a parent
[1:09:19] as a daddy I can go and do exactly what
[1:09:22] I'm telling my children not to do and
[1:09:25] what am I children going to think what
[1:09:27] are my children going to do my children
[1:09:29] are going to say I'm going to do exactly
[1:09:31] what Daddy's doing you can tell me not
[1:09:33] to do it all you want but you do it so
[1:09:36] why shouldn't
[1:09:38] I their Works testify to a new spirit
[1:09:41] within men saw their good works and
[1:09:44] glorified God men were able to get saved
[1:09:46] by the lives being lived through the
[1:09:48] Believers yes sir if you are a Christian
[1:09:52] and you are going to do what is right
[1:09:55] your your Works will show that your
[1:09:57] heart is
[1:09:58] right isn't that true though won't our
[1:10:02] our works our life show that we're
[1:10:04] actually right with the
[1:10:06] Lord works
[1:10:10] g241
[1:10:12] airone out of the Strong's Concordance
[1:10:14] by implication and act deed doing labor
[1:10:18] work it's something that we do we don't
[1:10:21] just say that we have it but we actually
[1:10:24] demonstrate it and and people say wow
[1:10:26] you got it you know I I think it's
[1:10:29] interesting there's two sides to the
[1:10:31] idea the ideology of works as I was
[1:10:34] studying this I just started
[1:10:36] contemplating it you know and one side
[1:10:38] is to look at all that I've done for the
[1:10:40] kingdom of God which is what the church
[1:10:42] typically does Universal the more works
[1:10:45] you do the more saved you become right
[1:10:47] and and that I want to say brothers and
[1:10:49] sisters if we're not careful it can
[1:10:50] creep into our lives as Believers to
[1:10:52] think that because we do good works that
[1:10:55] we're more saved that's not the
[1:10:59] case the verification of our life our
[1:11:02] life with the Lord and and his love for
[1:11:05] us is in the Divine it's in the Beloved
[1:11:08] right it's because he tells us that he
[1:11:10] loves us because he came and died for us
[1:11:14] but to say that I do good and now I'm
[1:11:17] saved can't you see how saved I am by
[1:11:19] how good I act doesn't work that way the
[1:11:23] other side is is to behave and and act
[1:11:28] like the works that I do will just make
[1:11:30] it right it it will somehow make the bad
[1:11:34] situation better and and that's not the
[1:11:37] case either there has to be a middle
[1:11:39] ground and and we know that the prophet
[1:11:41] taught that it's a razor edge thin it
[1:11:44] it's going to be so close that it would
[1:11:45] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:11:48] possible so guarantee you it's going to
[1:11:50] be in and around this message of the
[1:11:52] hour I personally believe brothers and
[1:11:54] sisters according to the word that
[1:11:56] there's only one way to see the works
[1:11:59] that's in this scripture here in
[1:12:00] Ephesians 2:10 and and that's to
[1:12:03] recognize that this is the very life of
[1:12:07] Jesus Christ Living out through us
[1:12:10] because we are his workmanship which
[1:12:12] means we've been created by Him to
[1:12:15] actually bear fruit and he said it we
[1:12:18] know we read that in in in John I
[1:12:20] believe it is that I am the vine and you
[1:12:22] are the branches and all of the branches
[1:12:25] es will be purged and the ones that
[1:12:27] won't bear fruit they're going to be
[1:12:28] clipped off and and and heu Into the
[1:12:30] Fire and that's so that the rest of the
[1:12:31] tree can grow better where it is
[1:12:33] producing
[1:12:34] fruit I Works doesn't actually save us
[1:12:39] brothers and
[1:12:40] sisters we are his workmanship created
[1:12:44] for himself to live in and
[1:12:50] through and you know because of that the
[1:12:54] works manifest EST they do they just do
[1:12:58] sheep they just bear wool doves are just
[1:13:02] white we just are believers because we
[1:13:06] believe we we have his life in us and
[1:13:10] even in the smallest of ways that's
[1:13:12] where I just wanted to say that you know
[1:13:14] which lie is is worse the the big one or
[1:13:17] the little one The Little White Lie the
[1:13:19] world says it's just a little white lie
[1:13:20] it's not a big deal but you know what if
[1:13:22] you went to court with that then you
[1:13:24] would actually lose all credibility in
[1:13:27] court in a court case right if you had
[1:13:29] just a little white lie because how many
[1:13:31] more of the answers would be Little
[1:13:32] White Lies and I would say this if you
[1:13:35] were actually taking and weighing The
[1:13:37] Little White Lies they would stack up to
[1:13:38] one great big lie wouldn't they even the
[1:13:42] smallest of ways guilty of the least is
[1:13:44] guilty of the
[1:13:45] whole you know in Revelations 21:8 it
[1:13:48] just made me think about this this one
[1:13:50] scripture here verse 8 Revelations 21:8
[1:13:53] but the fearful and un believing and the
[1:13:55] Abominable and the murderers and the
[1:13:57] mongers and the sorcerers and all
[1:14:00] idolators and all
[1:14:02] liars shall have their part in the lake
[1:14:04] which burneth with fire and brimstone
[1:14:07] which is the second death there is no
[1:14:09] such thing as a small sin there's no
[1:14:11] such thing as a small lie brothers and
[1:14:12] sisters it it is or it isn't it's sin or
[1:14:16] it's not but you know in John 14 I just
[1:14:18] love how Jesus said this verily verily I
[1:14:20] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:14:23] works that I do shall he do also we're
[1:14:27] not going to do another Works we're not
[1:14:29] going to act a different way from the
[1:14:30] way he set the pattern in the word of
[1:14:33] God we're not going to do that if we
[1:14:35] truly believe his word of God the way
[1:14:37] that he gave it to us and Greater Works
[1:14:39] than these shall he do because I go unto
[1:14:41] my father we know that brother bradam
[1:14:43] said it in the message of the hour it's
[1:14:44] not going to be greater works because
[1:14:46] you can't do Greater Works than raise
[1:14:48] someone from the dead but there will be
[1:14:49] a lot more of them amen and we know
[1:14:51] according to the message of the hour the
[1:14:53] prophet for our day he did a lot more
[1:14:56] miraculous things there was so much of a
[1:14:58] manifestation of the spirit of God in
[1:15:00] his life even more so than was
[1:15:02] documented of Jesus Christ in the word
[1:15:06] but we know that the word also says that
[1:15:07] you know you wouldn't even be able to
[1:15:09] document all of the things that happened
[1:15:11] in the life of Jesus when he walked here
[1:15:12] on Earth because he was God In the Flesh
[1:15:15] and so many things happened that many
[1:15:17] people don't even know it's just a
[1:15:19] wonderful thing you know brothers and
[1:15:21] sisters Works won't save us and and I
[1:15:23] think it's so good because we can we can
[1:15:26] remember this we can look at it and say
[1:15:28] brother Bram you know in 1965 he
[1:15:30] preached a message works is Faith
[1:15:34] expressed we're very familiar with that
[1:15:35] aren't we and it's true because that's
[1:15:38] exactly right and I say Amen to that
[1:15:40] every time I hear it and speak it and
[1:15:42] listen to that message works is Faith
[1:15:46] expressed it is not faith is Works
[1:15:52] expressed it's not the other way
[1:15:54] sometimes S I think it can actually
[1:15:56] become that way in our lives and that's
[1:15:58] what I'm saying it's the trick of the
[1:16:00] devil to get in there and make us think
[1:16:01] because we're doing good we've got all
[1:16:03] these good works everything is right in
[1:16:05] our life and it's not
[1:16:07] necessarily is it according to the word
[1:16:10] that is the sword that's the deciding
[1:16:12] factor is it according to the word if
[1:16:15] it's according to the word then I say
[1:16:16] hey you know what the works that you do
[1:16:19] are going to be just like he did and
[1:16:21] they're going to be more and it will be
[1:16:24] expressing the faith that's inside of us
[1:16:28] brother Bram he says yes sir if you are
[1:16:30] a Christian you are going to do what's
[1:16:33] right
[1:16:36] period even when it takes the hide off
[1:16:38] our
[1:16:39] backs even when it's the most
[1:16:41] uncomfortable conversation even when it
[1:16:45] it's the most difficult thing that we've
[1:16:46] ever done in our lives we will always do
[1:16:49] what's right because brothers and
[1:16:50] sisters that's where Jesus Christ is
[1:16:52] going to meet us he's not going to meet
[1:16:55] us hiding behind a lie he's not going to
[1:16:57] meet us hiding behind something that's
[1:16:59] not true he's only going to meet us
[1:17:02] right where the problem is your Works
[1:17:05] will show that your heart is right and
[1:17:09] it won't be something that you put
[1:17:12] on not just a garment not just a fig
[1:17:14] Leaf right I believe the message I
[1:17:17] believe God sent a prophet I I've got a
[1:17:19] fig Leaf no no it'll be the life that we
[1:17:22] live people will see it and they'll
[1:17:25] wonder about it and the best part is
[1:17:28] Lord willing people will get saved
[1:17:30] because of it because that's the
[1:17:32] ultimate thing is to see people get
[1:17:34] saved to find that last predestinated
[1:17:36] seed brother R goes on to say for you
[1:17:37] will do his will when no one but God
[1:17:42] sees you you will do his will when no
[1:17:46] one but God sees you and you will do his
[1:17:49] will even if it cost you your life
[1:17:56] that is
[1:17:57] hard but I believe it's
[1:17:59] true I know your love service faith and
[1:18:03] patience you will note that their love
[1:18:06] is placed between works and
[1:18:09] service and that is the right place for
[1:18:12] it because without love our works are
[1:18:15] not accepted before God and neither is
[1:18:20] our
[1:18:21] service that is powerful right there
[1:18:25] Paul speaking to the Corinthians said
[1:18:27] without love I am nothing and whatever I
[1:18:30] do is without profit unless it's done in
[1:18:34] love now you can see right here that
[1:18:37] these Believers weren't in that nickan
[1:18:41] class nicotin wait a second I thought we
[1:18:44] were talking
[1:18:46] thyrian ties it together doesn't
[1:18:49] he they weren't in that nickan class
[1:18:52] that did works as a mean of Salvation or
[1:18:56] to be admired by men they did their
[1:18:58] works out of the love of God that was
[1:19:01] shed abroad in their hearts by the holy
[1:19:04] ghost that love in their hearts was
[1:19:07] God's love for his own Jesus said by
[1:19:11] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:19:16] disciples that you have love one for
[1:19:19] another John
[1:19:21] 13:35 the pagans who saw the lives of
[1:19:24] the Earth early Christians said behold
[1:19:28] how they love each
[1:19:29] other John said in 1 John 47 everyone
[1:19:34] that loveth is born of
[1:19:38] God I just think it's such a good thing
[1:19:40] Lord willing we'll probably get into a
[1:19:42] study in
[1:19:44] love it's
[1:19:46] powerful it's the strongest force in the
[1:19:48] universe brothers and sisters there's
[1:19:50] nothing stronger than
[1:19:52] love I want to give you a warning right
[1:19:55] here it says concerning the last days
[1:19:57] that because of abounding iniquity
[1:20:00] knowing to do something and not doing it
[1:20:01] and knowing that you shouldn't do
[1:20:02] something and doing it iniquity
[1:20:05] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[1:20:07] wax cold in the Leo Dean or last AG self
[1:20:12] love and love for material things will
[1:20:15] take place of the true love of
[1:20:19] God now I've got this highlighted here
[1:20:21] and marked so I've got a harp on it for
[1:20:24] a bit
[1:20:26] self-love and love for material
[1:20:31] things help us
[1:20:34] Lord what is
[1:20:37] self-love just not considering
[1:20:40] others just making sure that everything
[1:20:42] that I need and I want I do and I
[1:20:45] get whether it's material things or
[1:20:48] whether it's maybe intellectual things
[1:20:51] maybe it's making myself to be the the
[1:20:54] boss I'm the
[1:20:56] boss right I love myself I love to look
[1:20:59] at myself in the mirror look at me look
[1:21:03] at my
[1:21:05] works and love for material things boy
[1:21:08] Amazon has made it real easy for that to
[1:21:10] happen right the love for material
[1:21:13] things we've got to be careful brothers
[1:21:15] and sisters the devil he knows exactly
[1:21:19] how we're created and you know what
[1:21:20] unfortunately all of us have human DNA
[1:21:24] man there's not one of us that has
[1:21:26] Angelic DNA we we're human beings and
[1:21:29] we're created in the image of God but in
[1:21:32] this flesh we have got to kill the old
[1:21:35] man if we're not willing to kill the old
[1:21:37] man then one of these two is going to
[1:21:39] happen we're going to get caught up with
[1:21:40] ourselves we'll we'll have to get
[1:21:43] doorways made wider so our heads will
[1:21:45] fit through them right and and so that
[1:21:47] we can drag all of our material things
[1:21:49] with us through those doors but it will
[1:21:51] take the place of the true love of God
[1:21:55] brother Bram says we need to guard
[1:21:57] against the power of sin in these last
[1:21:59] days so it's not just brother Barry
[1:22:01] saying it here brother Bram is saying we
[1:22:03] need to guard against the power of sin
[1:22:07] self-love and love for material things
[1:22:09] in these last
[1:22:11] days so many are getting so
[1:22:15] hard because they haven't realized the
[1:22:18] effect of this last day spirit I say
[1:22:21] Lord Jesus help us realize the effect of
[1:22:24] this last day
[1:22:26] Spirit help us to love one another like
[1:22:29] Christ loved the church that he would
[1:22:32] give us life for it that he would
[1:22:34] cherish it and nourish it it's time to
[1:22:39] draw nigh to God and let him fill our
[1:22:41] lives with his love or we will feel the
[1:22:45] coldness of the last day church and
[1:22:49] reject the truth of God which alone is
[1:22:51] able to help us the one thing that will
[1:22:54] be able to help us we'll reject
[1:23:00] it those dark and Dreadful years the
[1:23:02] True Vine held its love for God and love
[1:23:06] of the
[1:23:07] Brethren God commended them for for it I
[1:23:11] know your service Jesus said he that is
[1:23:14] greatest of
[1:23:16] all oh my is what he's servant of all a
[1:23:22] wise man commented on that saying here
[1:23:24] here's what he said only history will
[1:23:26] prove the truth of that dictum and that
[1:23:31] man was right all the truly great men of
[1:23:34] history have been
[1:23:36] servants they haven't been busting
[1:23:39] themselves forward saying get out of the
[1:23:41] way cuz I'm here amen Make Way for me
[1:23:45] they've been
[1:23:46] servants they who demanded to be
[1:23:49] served they who oppressed they who
[1:23:53] sought to always be at the head have
[1:23:56] gone down in
[1:23:58] shame even the very rich are condemned
[1:24:01] by God when they have not used their
[1:24:04] wealth
[1:24:07] right but look into history and you will
[1:24:11] find that the truly great were those who
[1:24:14] served
[1:24:16] others history can never Acclaim For
[1:24:19] Those whom much was done but it will
[1:24:22] forever praise those who did much for
[1:24:26] others
[1:24:28] now let us apply that to
[1:24:31] ourselves and I've got that highlighted
[1:24:33] too now let us apply that to ourselves
[1:24:36] now let let let me apply that to me even
[1:24:40] as the son of man came not to be
[1:24:42] ministered unto but to minister so are
[1:24:45] we to follow that
[1:24:47] example see him as he bows himself over
[1:24:50] the feet of the Apostles and washes
[1:24:53] their tired and dirty feet this one who
[1:24:56] is the ultimate judge with eyes flames
[1:24:59] of fire and feet of brass for judgment
[1:25:03] that one bowing down and
[1:25:07] washing stinking
[1:25:10] feet
[1:25:12] my he said you don't know now what I am
[1:25:15] doing but you will know
[1:25:18] Hereafter but what you see me doing you
[1:25:21] ought also to do he became became a
[1:25:24] servant in order that God could Elevate
[1:25:27] him to the highest
[1:25:28] Heights and one day in the Judgment of
[1:25:32] the Saints we are going to hear him say
[1:25:34] Well
[1:25:35] done good and faithful servant enter
[1:25:39] thou into the joy of the
[1:25:42] Lord It's hard to always be a
[1:25:45] servant but those who spend and are
[1:25:48] spent for others will one day be seated
[1:25:50] with him in his
[1:25:53] throne it will be worth it all then let
[1:25:56] us labor for the
[1:25:58] master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun
[1:26:02] let us talk of all his wondrous love and
[1:26:04] care amen and when all of life is over
[1:26:08] and our work on Earth is done and the
[1:26:11] role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there
[1:26:15] amen I know your faith now he does not
[1:26:19] say here as he did to the church in
[1:26:22] pergamus you hold my faith he's not
[1:26:26] talking about his faith now but he's
[1:26:29] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:26:33] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:26:37] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:26:41] go
[1:26:41] together in fact patience is the outcome
[1:26:45] of
[1:26:45] faithfulness for it says in James the
[1:26:49] trying of your faith worketh patience
[1:26:52] amen James 13 three there is absolutely
[1:26:56] no other way in which to gain
[1:26:58] patience it has to come by the trial of
[1:27:02] our faith and this world brothers and
[1:27:04] sisters unfortunately is set up to
[1:27:07] actually create us to be impatient isn't
[1:27:09] it you can hardly drive on the roads
[1:27:12] without getting in someone's way and
[1:27:14] having people honk at you or shake their
[1:27:17] fist or or we ourselves become the ones
[1:27:21] actually driving faster to not get any
[1:27:23] anybody's way
[1:27:28] God's will oh sorry there's absolutely
[1:27:31] no other way in which to gain patience
[1:27:33] it has to come by the trial of our
[1:27:36] faith and you know the trial of our
[1:27:39] faith is where we reach the darkest
[1:27:42] place in our
[1:27:44] lives where we don't just have the
[1:27:47] flowery bed ofes where we don't just
[1:27:50] have situations where we think that you
[1:27:52] know it's difficult it's hard situation
[1:27:55] but where we come to where we really
[1:27:57] have to say do I believe or not because
[1:28:01] the devil's going to come around and say
[1:28:04] this is the Lord you serve remember the
[1:28:07] story about brother brandham when his
[1:28:09] wife had already passed and the doctors
[1:28:11] came and told him about his other his
[1:28:13] daughter now Sharon Rose flies in her
[1:28:16] eyes her eyes Crossing from the pain
[1:28:18] that she was going through as a little
[1:28:20] baby an infant and and how he had to
[1:28:23] endure that go through that situation
[1:28:25] and that's right when the treachery of
[1:28:28] the Devil comes around he takes us to
[1:28:29] our darkest spot God allows us to get
[1:28:33] there to try our faith that's what he's
[1:28:35] trying us he's not trying to see whether
[1:28:38] we have good church attendance or
[1:28:40] whether we're good people good citizens
[1:28:42] it's the trial of our faith where the
[1:28:44] devil will come around and say that's
[1:28:46] the god you serve you did all of that
[1:28:49] for him you made yourself a fool
[1:28:51] everybody mocked you and laughed at you
[1:28:53] and you still had held fast to this
[1:28:55] message and and you prayed for people
[1:28:57] and everybody got well but you can't
[1:28:59] pray for your wife and have her get well
[1:29:02] that's the god you serve
[1:29:05] really that's what the devil is going to
[1:29:07] do he's going to come around with that
[1:29:08] kind of talk and when we reach our
[1:29:10] darkest hour that's when the rubber
[1:29:13] meets the road and we show who we
[1:29:16] are that's when we can understand
[1:29:19] brothers and sisters it is the trial of
[1:29:21] our faith it's not the trial of our
[1:29:22] riches it's not the trial of of our our
[1:29:25] our our our Goods in this world our
[1:29:27] worldly actions it's the trial of our
[1:29:29] faith do we believe or not in Romans 5:3
[1:29:33] tribulation worketh patience how highly
[1:29:36] God regards this outworking of our
[1:29:39] patience as seen in James
[1:29:43] 1:4 but let patience have her perfect
[1:29:47] work who knew that patience was uh
[1:29:51] feminine but let patience have her
[1:29:54] perfect work I just can't help but think
[1:29:56] that that patience is likely speaking of
[1:29:59] the Church of the Living God the
[1:30:01] feminine but let patience have her
[1:30:03] perfect work that ye may be
[1:30:06] perfect and entire lacking nothing isn't
[1:30:11] that interesting how Perfection is
[1:30:13] linked to patience I say Lord help me
[1:30:17] Lord help me God's will for us is
[1:30:21] perfection isn't that beautiful and that
[1:30:24] Perfection is
[1:30:28] patience I would never have thought this
[1:30:30] outside of reading this book outside of
[1:30:32] studying the the the exposition of the
[1:30:34] seven Church ages God's will for us is
[1:30:37] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:30:39] patience wow waiting on God and waiting
[1:30:43] for God Isn't that true they that wait
[1:30:46] upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:30:50] strength this is the process of
[1:30:52] character development not getting what
[1:30:55] we want when we ask the way we ask and
[1:30:59] still being able to love him the trial
[1:31:02] of our
[1:31:04] faith understanding that sometimes what
[1:31:06] we ask for isn't actually his will for
[1:31:09] us but waiting on God and waiting for
[1:31:14] God this is the process of character
[1:31:16] development how highly God has commended
[1:31:20] these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as
[1:31:23] as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly
[1:31:28] Faithfully they served God that is all
[1:31:31] they wanted out of life just service to
[1:31:33] their lord how great was to be their
[1:31:36] reward my I Know Thy works and the last
[1:31:40] to be more than the first this is
[1:31:42] certainly remarkable as the darkness of
[1:31:44] the age increased as the honor role of
[1:31:47] the martyrs grew lengthier day by day
[1:31:51] they worked all the harder they served
[1:31:54] all the more and their faith
[1:31:57] increased how tragic it was that in the
[1:31:59] Ephesian age love waned and truly
[1:32:02] nothing is said of the increased labor
[1:32:06] of love in the other ages but in this
[1:32:09] age in the darkest of all ages they
[1:32:12] served him even more amen
[1:32:17] wow what a lesson that is just thinking
[1:32:20] about this again brothers and sisters I
[1:32:22] can't help but think about it those
[1:32:23] we've heard about the Dark Ages we've
[1:32:25] read about the persecution we've heard
[1:32:26] about the fox's book of Martyrs all the
[1:32:28] people that have gone ahead before us
[1:32:29] given their lives for this message watch
[1:32:31] their families to be destroyed fed to
[1:32:33] Lions etc etc we've all heard about that
[1:32:36] but one day we're going to go shake
[1:32:37] their hands we're going to say how did
[1:32:40] you do
[1:32:42] it what an honor and a privilege it is
[1:32:44] to meet you to think that you were in
[1:32:47] that terrible
[1:32:49] situation
[1:32:52] my it just makes makes me think what's
[1:32:54] my
[1:32:55] troubles what's my
[1:32:58] tribulations I can just go and turn on
[1:33:00] the to and have a hot shower I can go to
[1:33:04] the fridge and just get some food we can
[1:33:06] just go and jump in our vehicles yeah we
[1:33:11] can go to our jobs we can even just come
[1:33:13] to the place of worship where we've got
[1:33:15] soft seats not wooden pews right where
[1:33:19] we've got air conditioning and fans and
[1:33:21] a furnace that heats it you know there's
[1:33:23] people that have worshiped regardless
[1:33:26] regardless of the situation
[1:33:30] why what a lesson that is brother bradam
[1:33:33] says there's no ceasing of this gracious
[1:33:36] service of Love unto the Lord I better
[1:33:38] call the
[1:33:39] musicians I could just keep going and
[1:33:41] going and going with this it's so good
[1:33:43] there's no other there's no ceasing of
[1:33:46] this gracious service of Love unto the
[1:33:49] Lord but rather an increasing of it and
[1:33:53] and and another one here this nugget
[1:33:55] just before we close that's the secret
[1:33:57] brother bradam says let the enemy
[1:33:59] attempt to thwart our service to the
[1:34:01] Lord our reply is
[1:34:05] what increased service stand with me as
[1:34:08] we close tonight let the enemy attempt
[1:34:10] to thwart our service to the Lord
[1:34:12] whatever it is and our reply is
[1:34:16] increased service when the faint are
[1:34:20] crying in fear that is the time to to
[1:34:23] shout the victory amen God bless you
[1:34:27] tonight we'll just end right there let's
[1:34:30] just bow in
[1:34:32] prayer Heavenly Father Lord I just can't
[1:34:35] help but think of all the saints that
[1:34:37] have gone on Lord and to think about the
[1:34:40] pressures that they were under and the
[1:34:42] trials that they had to endure father
[1:34:45] knowing it was the trial of their faith
[1:34:47] and Lord nothing could take that Faith
[1:34:50] because we know that you are the same
[1:34:52] yesterday today and forever and we know
[1:34:54] that it's not a faith in God it's the
[1:34:58] faith of God that it was literally your
[1:35:00] faith living out through those Saints in
[1:35:02] that age and we know that it doesn't
[1:35:05] make it any
[1:35:06] easier sometimes when we talk that way
[1:35:09] it can sound like it's maybe a
[1:35:11] supernatural faith that would just make
[1:35:13] it
[1:35:14] simple but we know that Lord there was
[1:35:16] something inside of them that desired to
[1:35:19] serve you harder and and longer the more
[1:35:22] the persecutions came name and father I
[1:35:25] pray that tonight we would just consider
[1:35:28] some of the words that were spoken
[1:35:29] father and Lord if anything was spoken
[1:35:31] out of turn forgive me I pray that we
[1:35:35] could just heed to your word Lord Jesus
[1:35:37] that we would allow it to live out
[1:35:40] through US
[1:35:41] Lord we know that's the desire of your
[1:35:44] children tonight father is is to not
[1:35:47] just hear your word but to do your word
[1:35:49] father to not just be hearers but doers
[1:35:52] Lord Jesus oh father let us live lives
[1:35:56] in such a way that the works Express oh
[1:35:59] what kind of faith we truly have to this
[1:36:01] world around us Lord let our co-workers
[1:36:04] say You Must Believe in a different way
[1:36:07] than I've ever seen before Oh father let
[1:36:10] the the children in school be able to be
[1:36:13] that bright shining light in that that
[1:36:15] world of Darkness Lord in this oh Father

[1:36:20] agendas that are there Lord trying to
[1:36:23] teach our children things that are so
[1:36:26] foreign to
[1:36:28] Believers father we pray that you would
[1:36:30] help the husbands and the wives Lord to
[1:36:33] just live a life so consecrated to you
[1:36:35] that it encourages their spouse Lord
[1:36:38] Jesus to serve you more oh Father help
[1:36:42] each one of us Lord to have that love
[1:36:44] one to another that Lord the world would
[1:36:47] say they truly believe because they love
[1:36:50] so strong amen father we love you
[1:36:52] tonight we just thank you for all of
[1:36:55] your Tender Mercies in our lives and we
[1:36:57] pray that as we go forwards we would
[1:36:59] think about those people who have gone
[1:37:00] on before us Lord that laid down their
[1:37:03] lives for this gospel help us Lord Jesus
[1:37:06] to be willing to do the same we just ask
[1:37:09] now that you would keep your hand upon
[1:37:10] us Lord as we go our separate ways

[1:37:16] more than we ever have in our
[1:37:18] lives father I just want to ask all
