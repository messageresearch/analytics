[58:11] brother Donald Snow's mother God bless
[58:13] you Sister
[58:18] welcome trust you feel right at home and
[58:21] uh look forward to some fellowship with
[58:22] you Lord willing are you happy
[58:26] tonight carrying on in the uh Ephesian
[58:29] Church age and you know last week in the
[58:33] book um the exposition of the seven
[58:36] Church ages brother brandom he he
[58:39] started to uh explain the city of
[58:42] Ephesus and how it was the third city of
[58:44] Christian faith um just behind Antioch
[58:50] as the second church and Jerusalem as
[58:52] the first one and Paul Paul was the
[58:55] messenger to this church to this city he
[58:59] was the one that pastored here and that
[59:02] was for about three years and then we
[59:04] know Timothy took
[59:06] over but you know he goes on to talk
[59:09] about the very name Ephesus has a
[59:11] strange compound meaning is aimed at and
[59:15] relaxed and you know that's what
[59:17] happened into this church this church
[59:20] age it it started to get relaxed and uh
[59:24] that's certainly not what we want to do
[59:27] in the day in which we live but you know
[59:30] brother bam he says that uh this church
[59:33] it it relaxed and in that unguarded
[59:37] moment Satan planted the seat the seed
[59:41] of complete
[59:43] ruination and you know he comes in very
[59:46] very subtly Satan always comes in very
[59:50] very subtly and it's always as a thought
[59:53] and then it comes out as a discussion
[59:55] just a really simple discussion nothing
[59:57] too big really easy and calm but then
[1:00:03] what happens is this discussion it
[1:00:06] plants seeds and then the seeds they
[1:00:08] start to actually grow and manifest and
[1:00:11] that's the way Satan does it it's the
[1:00:12] way he did it from the very beginning
[1:00:14] but that's the way he even does it today
[1:00:16] you know brother bradam he goes on to
[1:00:18] talk about this in uh the next few
[1:00:20] paragraphs about how the the the people
[1:00:22] there the the false prophet is what he
[1:00:25] calls them they they introduced a a
[1:00:28] magnificent Temple of Diana and and how
[1:00:32] initially they introduced a shapeless
[1:00:34] female figure that sunk into the block
[1:00:37] of wood from which it was carved and her
[1:00:39] two arms were formed of two simple bars
[1:00:42] of iron brother randam he says how
[1:00:45] perfectly this depicts the spirit of
[1:00:47] antichrist loosed in the first age there
[1:00:49] he was loosed in the midst of the people
[1:00:52] and yet took no shape as to alarm the
[1:00:54] people
[1:00:55] people Satan is an
[1:00:57] expert Master at doing this he'll creep
[1:01:01] in people unawares he does it so good it
[1:01:06] it's just unbelievable the way he does
[1:01:08] it and and he goes on to say that yet
[1:01:11] the two arms are iron bars showed that
[1:01:13] it was the intent to crush the work of
[1:01:16] God as he made inroads and no one seemed
[1:01:19] to notice him or what he was doing but I
[1:01:22] love how he says this but one day they
[1:01:24] would notice and it's the same thing
[1:01:27] today brothers and sisters we have the
[1:01:28] ability to recognize that Antichrist
[1:01:32] spirit and and you might wonder why I'm
[1:01:34] talking this way because brother bradam
[1:01:35] said it that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:01:38] creep its way into the
[1:01:40] framework not of the denominational
[1:01:43] Church into the framework of the
[1:01:45] Christian church and what does that do
[1:01:47] it causes it to become lukewarm formal
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:52] Powerless why would we want to waste our
[1:01:54] time time coming to church to be
[1:01:57] lukewarm to be formal and to be
[1:02:02] powerless he goes on to talk about the
[1:02:05] the the order of Temple service and and
[1:02:07] there was different things you know
[1:02:09] there was there was a people who claimed
[1:02:11] to know God they were Unix and they were
[1:02:14] apart from everything else but we know
[1:02:17] that they actually became sterile to the
[1:02:19] word then he talks about the virgins and
[1:02:22] how they had the religious acts in the
[1:02:23] temple and
[1:02:25] and and they would do the ritual and the
[1:02:26] works and then the third one was the
[1:02:28] political power and public influence and
[1:02:31] and you know this the devil is never far
[1:02:34] away from politics in the church he
[1:02:36] loves politics and as soon as the church
[1:02:39] gets into politics brothers and sisters
[1:02:41] look out it's not going to work it has
[1:02:44] to be the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:47] that's the only way a church can
[1:02:49] flourish that's the only way the true
[1:02:51] church will flourish I I want to say
[1:02:53] that clearly that's the only way way
[1:02:54] that the true church will flourish is no
[1:02:56] Politics as soon as politics comes in
[1:02:59] because it does you can look outside and
[1:03:01] see all kinds of churches with politics
[1:03:04] and maybe they have great signs and
[1:03:05] wonders too but have they got the word
[1:03:08] that's the critical
[1:03:10] Factor you know he he he talks about how
[1:03:14] they they went on and speaking
[1:03:16] specifically about the the the Catholic
[1:03:19] church and and how they went in and they
[1:03:21] got ill-gotten wealth and they just
[1:03:23] built the people out of all of their
[1:03:25] riches training them to intercede for
[1:03:28] for their loved ones who have gone on
[1:03:30] and died and and saying that you can pay
[1:03:33] to get them out of purgatory what a
[1:03:35] tremendous lie that is to think that you
[1:03:37] could give money and get people out of
[1:03:40] hell there's no money that's going to
[1:03:42] get people out of hell the only thing
[1:03:44] that will do that is the word of
[1:03:47] God but anyways it just is a a
[1:03:50] tremendous thing and just a little bit
[1:03:51] of a recap from last week now we want to
[1:03:54] get get into Jesus his messenger and
[1:03:56] churches this is Page 84 of the
[1:03:59] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:04:01] Revelations 2 verse1 these things saith
[1:04:04] he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[1:04:06] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[1:04:09] the seven golden candlesticks and
[1:04:12] remember this is the Lord God Almighty
[1:04:15] this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:04:16] today and forever walking in the midst
[1:04:19] of his seven golden candlesticks those
[1:04:21] are the seven Church ages those seven
[1:04:23] churches those candlesticks and remember
[1:04:26] he he said in Revelations chapter 2 if
[1:04:28] you don't repent and get back to your
[1:04:29] first love if you don't go back to where
[1:04:31] you got off then he will remove the
[1:04:35] Candlestick brother BR goes on to say
[1:04:37] this is he of whom it is said this same
[1:04:39] Jesus both Lord and Christ there he is
[1:04:43] the one and only Lord God Almighty and
[1:04:46] beside him there is no other there he is
[1:04:50] the savior salvation is of the Lord
[1:04:53] Jonah 2: 9 walking in the midst of the
[1:04:56] churches throughout the Seven Ages what
[1:04:58] he was in the first age he is in all
[1:05:02] ages isn't that beautiful to every
[1:05:05] believer he is Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:08] yesterday today and forever what he did
[1:05:11] once he's still doing and will keep
[1:05:13] doing
[1:05:16] am now you will notice that Jesus is
[1:05:18] walking alone in the midst of his
[1:05:21] churches there was no one else with him
[1:05:25] neither indeed can there be for he alone
[1:05:28] wrought her salvation and having
[1:05:32] purchased her with his own blood he owns
[1:05:35] her he owns you brothers and sisters he
[1:05:39] owns us we are his inheritance and he's
[1:05:44] not going to let go any part of
[1:05:48] it he is her Lord and Master she gives
[1:05:52] him all the glory and All That Glory he
[1:05:55] will not share with another love the way
[1:05:59] he says this this just oh man there's no
[1:06:02] Pope with him there's no Archbishop with
[1:06:05] him Mary the mother of his Earthly body
[1:06:09] is not with him this is such an
[1:06:12] important part brothers and sisters that
[1:06:14] we need to remember and I know we do I'm
[1:06:17] preaching to the choir here it just it
[1:06:18] does does something to me though he does
[1:06:21] not speak and then turn to the father
[1:06:25] for he is the
[1:06:27] father he does not turn to give orders
[1:06:31] to a holy spirit for he is God eternal
[1:06:35] spirit right and it is his life that's
[1:06:38] flowing and pulsating the church giving
[1:06:42] her life and without him there would be
[1:06:44] no
[1:06:45] life salvation is of the Lord amen we
[1:06:50] can't pray and intercede for dead loved
[1:06:53] ones their time on Earth was their time
[1:06:56] on Earth and they had the opportunity to
[1:06:58] hear the gospel yes sir and hopefully if
[1:07:01] they couldn't receive it maybe they did
[1:07:03] something good for that elected one that
[1:07:06] tried to explain it to them but there's
[1:07:08] no paying to get people out of
[1:07:12] purgatory salvation is of the Lord
[1:07:16] Brother BR goes on to say there was no
[1:07:17] one with him when he trod the fierceness
[1:07:21] of the Wrath of the fiery furnace yes it
[1:07:25] was not another but him who hung upon
[1:07:28] the cross and gave his blood he is the
[1:07:32] author and finisher of our faith he is
[1:07:36] the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation the
[1:07:40] beginning and the ending of our
[1:07:42] salvation but everything in between
[1:07:44] brothers and sisters it's not just the
[1:07:45] beginning and the ending or the ending
[1:07:48] and the beginning it's every single part
[1:07:50] of it from the beginning to the end amen
[1:07:53] the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation we
[1:07:57] are espoused to him and not another we
[1:08:00] don't belong to the church we belong to
[1:08:04] him amen his word is
[1:08:06] law Creeds dogmas bylaws and
[1:08:10] constitutions have no effect on
[1:08:13] us yet it is Jesus alone who walks in
[1:08:18] the midst of the churches yes it is God
[1:08:22] in her willing and doing of his good
[1:08:24] pleasure never forget that isn't that
[1:08:28] beautiful never forget that you have
[1:08:30] only one relationship to God and God has
[1:08:34] only one relationship to
[1:08:37] you that is Jesus and Jesus
[1:08:43] alone now later on brother Brandon
[1:08:45] really gets into it but I just think
[1:08:47] it's so important to say it you know as
[1:08:49] we talk about this how important it is
[1:08:52] to remember what the Ephesian Church age
[1:08:56] did they let their guard down and Satan
[1:09:00] crept in yes sir and it was a simple
[1:09:03] discussion it was a simple thought it
[1:09:05] was a simple change maybe in the way
[1:09:08] they worship to bring the figure of
[1:09:10] Diana back into the temple and and and
[1:09:13] just the representation of her being
[1:09:15] there it caused something to happen but
[1:09:18] the devil made it look like it was just
[1:09:19] so subtle nothing is going to change it
[1:09:21] won't be a problem it was a huge problem
[1:09:26] paragraph 52 he says there he is with
[1:09:28] the Seven Stars in his right hand the
[1:09:31] right hand or arm signifies the power
[1:09:34] and authority of
[1:09:36] God for they got this is Psalms 443 for
[1:09:40] they got not the land in possession by
[1:09:43] their own sword neither did their own
[1:09:46] arms save them but thy right hand and
[1:09:50] thine arm and the light of thy
[1:09:53] countenance because thou Hast a favor
[1:09:56] unto them and we know this is talking
[1:09:58] about the children of Israel coming out
[1:10:00] of bondage going into the promised land
[1:10:02] and how many battles did they fight on
[1:10:04] their own they they fought every single
[1:10:06] battle as they surrendered unto the Lord
[1:10:09] because he fought the battles for them
[1:10:11] and he told them to go forwards and be
[1:10:13] strong and be very courageous and don't
[1:10:15] fear because all the days of your life
[1:10:17] no man shall be able to stand before you
[1:10:19] as long as you are in the promised land
[1:10:21] as long as you're following the
[1:10:23] instructions of the word for your
[1:10:26] day but it was the Lord that did it it
[1:10:29] was his right hand of
[1:10:31] power paragraph 53 in that right hand of
[1:10:35] Power are seven stars who according to
[1:10:37] Revelations 1:20 are the seven Church
[1:10:41] Messengers this signifies that the very
[1:10:43] power and authority of God are behind
[1:10:47] his Messengers to every age they go
[1:10:50] forth in the fire and power of the Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost with the word they are stars
[1:10:57] because they reflect light the light
[1:10:59] they reflect is his light they have no
[1:11:02] light of their own they Kindle not their
[1:11:04] own fires that men may walk in the light
[1:11:07] of their Sparks Isaiah
[1:11:10] 5011 it is night for that is when the
[1:11:14] stars come out it is the night of
[1:11:17] Blackness of sin for all even the whole
[1:11:21] world have sinned and are constantly
[1:11:24] falling short of the glory of God Romans
[1:11:29] 3:23 you know when speaking of that how
[1:11:32] how it's the Blackness of sin for the
[1:11:35] whole world have sinned and constantly
[1:11:38] falling short of the glory of God I I
[1:11:41] remember when I first came in to the
[1:11:43] message of the hour when I first heard
[1:11:45] about it and started coming to church
[1:11:46] and hearing about a prophet and hearing
[1:11:48] the word and and and hearing that
[1:11:52] Hollywood is the biggest influencer in
[1:11:54] the entire world how I thought man
[1:11:57] that's kind of crazy but the more I
[1:11:59] started to look at it the more I thought
[1:12:01] wow isn't it true the whole world looks
[1:12:04] at the United States of America a and
[1:12:07] follows the United States of America
[1:12:08] they became the pace Setter the trend
[1:12:10] Setter for the
[1:12:12] world and I don't think there's anything
[1:12:14] good that comes out of Hollywood is
[1:12:17] there we know that uh it was said I
[1:12:20] Believe by the prophet that that's
[1:12:21] actually the seed of Satan that's where
[1:12:23] he chose to seat himself because he
[1:12:25] could influence as many people as would
[1:12:28] watch his
[1:12:29] programs through television and the
[1:12:32] picture shows and so on and so forth and
[1:12:35] now we know it's the Internet isn't it
[1:12:37] interesting that that's where the
[1:12:38] internet came
[1:12:40] from I could be wrong with that is that
[1:12:42] true though is that where the internet
[1:12:44] came from Silicone Valley it might have
[1:12:46] come from other places brother John you
[1:12:47] say yeah I just thought of that now I
[1:12:50] I've never thought of that that's
[1:12:51] interesting the whole internet and and
[1:12:53] what is the internet for most of it is
[1:12:55] is not good paragraph 54 these seven
[1:12:59] Messengers are making God known to the
[1:13:02] people he that receiveth them receiveth
[1:13:05] him that sent them John 13:20 they speak
[1:13:09] and act upon his authority he stands
[1:13:12] behind them with all the power of
[1:13:17] godhead Matthew 28:18-20 and Jesus came
[1:13:20] and spake unto them saying all power is
[1:13:23] given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:13:26] could you imagine what it would have
[1:13:27] been like to be talking to a man that
[1:13:29] would say
[1:13:31] that all power is given unto me in
[1:13:34] heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and
[1:13:37] teach All Nations baptizing them in the
[1:13:40] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:13:43] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[1:13:46] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[1:13:48] you and lo I am I Am With You Always
[1:13:52] even unto the end end of the world
[1:13:54] consummation of the
[1:13:55] ages I just was thinking about this
[1:13:57] today while I was meditating on this and
[1:14:00] and listening and and just studying and
[1:14:03] and I just thought man to baptize in the
[1:14:06] name of the father what's the name of
[1:14:08] the father we all know this I know it's
[1:14:09] so interesting though in the name of the
[1:14:12] son if we were to go and greet someone
[1:14:14] in the name of the father it would mean
[1:14:17] nothing it would mean nothing or or the
[1:14:20] name of the son or or the name of the
[1:14:23] Holy ghost I mean what's the name yes
[1:14:25] sir it's so obvious even brother bradam
[1:14:27] he says it that it's so glaringly
[1:14:29] obvious you don't need a revelation it
[1:14:31] just says it very clearly it's not names
[1:14:34] those are all
[1:14:35] titles
[1:14:38] positions the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:40] Christ that's where the power
[1:14:43] lies paragraph 55 so there they are full
[1:14:46] of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with
[1:14:49] the fire of God speaking of The
[1:14:51] Messengers holding forth the word of
[1:14:53] Truth and there he stands to back them
[1:14:56] up and think of it not one believer of
[1:14:59] any age need cry in his heart oh that I
[1:15:02] might have been back there in the first
[1:15:05] age when the apostles were first sent
[1:15:08] out there is no need to look back look
[1:15:12] up Behold Him who is even now walking in
[1:15:16] the midst of the churches through all
[1:15:20] ages Behold Him who is the same
[1:15:23] yesterday today and for yesterday today
[1:15:25] and forever and who never changes either
[1:15:28] in essence or in his ways I love how
[1:15:32] brother Bram he says this that you know
[1:15:34] there they are full of the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:37] faith on fire with the fire of God
[1:15:38] holding forth a word of Truth and there
[1:15:40] he stands to back them up just makes me
[1:15:44] think of the story of the maniac in in
[1:15:46] Oregon was it Oregon Oregon where that
[1:15:50] Maniac came up on the stage where
[1:15:52] brother Brandon was pre preaching and he
[1:15:54] said I'm going to kill you and all what
[1:15:56] happened when he came in all of the
[1:15:58] ministers who were on the stage they all
[1:16:01] ran but brother randam he stood there
[1:16:04] and what happened was he had compassion
[1:16:06] on the man he had love for the man he
[1:16:09] wasn't afraid of the man because it
[1:16:11] wasn't him standing there he was
[1:16:13] standing there at the commission of
[1:16:14] almighty God just like he described
[1:16:16] there knowing that he was in the word
[1:16:19] and it was the truth of the hour that he
[1:16:21] was bringing and he knew it wasn't up to
[1:16:23] him to back it up it was God that was
[1:16:25] doing
[1:16:26] it and it's so sad because we know that
[1:16:29] afterwards Billy Paul asked him daddy
[1:16:31] was that man delivered and he said no he
[1:16:33] wasn't we know that he told him you're
[1:16:35] you're going to kill me you're not going
[1:16:36] to kill me you're going to fall across
[1:16:38] my feet tonight and the man spit in his
[1:16:40] face and pulled his arm back and what
[1:16:42] did he say he just fell
[1:16:46] over but it wasn't him that did it it
[1:16:48] wasn't brother bradam that did it it's
[1:16:50] so important to recognize it's the
[1:16:52] paragraph that we just just read that
[1:16:53] was almighty God walking in the midst of
[1:16:56] his
[1:16:57] church he says Behold Him who was the
[1:17:00] same yesterday today and forever and who
[1:17:03] never changes either in essence or in
[1:17:05] his ways where two or three are gathered
[1:17:07] together in his name there he is in
[1:17:09] their midst there's more than two people
[1:17:11] gathered here tonight in his name
[1:17:13] brothers and sisters he's here tonight
[1:17:15] walking up and down the roads going from
[1:17:17] seat to seat heart to heart mind to mind
[1:17:19] it's the same God here
[1:17:22] tonight
[1:17:23] and not only in their midst as a
[1:17:25] complacent onlooker or as a recording
[1:17:28] Angel but there he stands expressing
[1:17:32] exactly what he is the life and
[1:17:35] sustainer and Giver of all good gifts to
[1:17:38] the church Hallelujah
[1:17:41] my 56 who walketh in the midst of the
[1:17:45] seven golden
[1:17:46] candlesticks how meaningful are these
[1:17:49] words when viewed in the light of the
[1:17:51] scripture which Des describes him as
[1:17:54] Christ who is our life for Christ indeed
[1:17:58] is the life of the church remember he
[1:18:01] said it I am the vine and ye are the
[1:18:04] branches she has no other life without
[1:18:07] him she is simply a religious Society a
[1:18:12] club a meaningless Gathering of people
[1:18:16] now brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:18:18] dwell on this for a moment it's
[1:18:20] important brother brandham says as a
[1:18:23] corpse a dead body be jeweled and
[1:18:27] dressed it is still a corpse that's a
[1:18:31] dead person with with with maybe jewels
[1:18:36] and and a beautiful clothing garments
[1:18:39] hair done just right it's still a corpse
[1:18:42] it's still a dead person he says so the
[1:18:45] church no matter what her programs and
[1:18:48] her Rel her gracious efforts might
[1:18:51] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[1:18:55] also yes
[1:18:58] sir that's why we continually preach on
[1:19:02] the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters
[1:19:05] because it's only by his spirit that we
[1:19:07] actually are not a corpse
[1:19:09] right he says but with him in her midst
[1:19:13] with him motivating her she becomes to
[1:19:17] the wonderment of
[1:19:19] all his body the f fullness of him that
[1:19:24] filth all in all now brothers and
[1:19:27] sisters I
[1:19:29] just this does something for me because
[1:19:32] you know if we're looking for a body
[1:19:35] change we were talking about
[1:19:38] this brother dawn and I if we're looking
[1:19:40] for the body change this is the body
[1:19:42] change the washing of the Water by the
[1:19:44] word this is the body change now brother
[1:19:47] Don's probably going to preach on this
[1:19:49] one day and I'm sorry brother but I just
[1:19:50] I can't help it this is the body
[1:19:53] change it
[1:19:55] culminates changing
[1:19:57] Dimensions but we're not going to become
[1:19:59] a different person over there the
[1:20:02] character that we have here is what
[1:20:04] we're going to take there that's why the
[1:20:06] prophet said that that's why we have to
[1:20:09] be Washed by the Water of the word we
[1:20:12] can't hope that one day oh Lord I'll lay
[1:20:14] this body down and suddenly I'll become
[1:20:17] a new creature in Christ Jesus no you
[1:20:20] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:20:21] right now
[1:20:23] while there's still time yes so his
[1:20:26] Spirit can live out through you so he
[1:20:28] the spirit of truth will take us to the
[1:20:30] other
[1:20:32] side my but with him in their in her
[1:20:36] midst with him motivating her she
[1:20:38] becomes to the wonderment of all his
[1:20:40] body the fullness of him that filth all
[1:20:43] in all and this very hour he is walking
[1:20:46] in the midst of the last ages golden
[1:20:48] Candlestick I love the way he says it
[1:20:51] it's not just about the Ephesian Church
[1:20:53] age way back there somewhere he brings
[1:20:55] it right up to
[1:20:57] today what he was as he walked in
[1:21:02] the what he was as he walked in in the
[1:21:06] first age he is even now in this last
[1:21:09] age Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:21:12] today and forever Exodus
[1:21:15] 25:31 and thou shalt make a Candlestick
[1:21:18] of pure gold of beaten work shall the
[1:21:22] Candlestick be made his shaft his
[1:21:25] branches his bowls his knops his flowers
[1:21:28] shall be the
[1:21:30] same paragraph 57 seven golden
[1:21:33] candlesticks the True Church of Jesus
[1:21:37] Christ the bride is likened to pure
[1:21:41] gold amen her righteousness is his
[1:21:46] righteousness isn't that beautiful
[1:21:49] there's anything good in a Believer it's
[1:21:51] not us it's only him yes sir it's only
[1:21:55] him amen her attributes are his own
[1:21:59] glorious
[1:22:01] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:22:05] what he is she is to
[1:22:08] reflect now I just I started thinking
[1:22:10] about this brothers and sisters this is
[1:22:11] so powerful because this is Ephesians
[1:22:14] chapter 5 if we want to see what the man
[1:22:17] is alls we have to do is look at the
[1:22:18] wife if you want to see what the church
[1:22:21] is brother bradam says if you want to
[1:22:23] know what's going on in the church take
[1:22:24] a look at the women in the church are
[1:22:27] they running wild are they dressing
[1:22:30] crazy or or are they living like
[1:22:32] Christians if we want to see what the
[1:22:35] nature of the husband is look at the
[1:22:37] wife because the wife reflects the
[1:22:38] husband the bride reflects Christ
[1:22:42] amen her attributes are his own glorious
[1:22:46] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:22:50] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[1:22:53] she is to manifest there is no fault in
[1:22:58] her she is all glorious within and
[1:23:01] without from beginning to ending she is
[1:23:04] the work of the Lord and all his works
[1:23:07] are perfect in fact in her is summed up
[1:23:11] and manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:23:14] purpose of
[1:23:16] God this is almost too much to
[1:23:19] comprehend how can one fathom it how how
[1:23:22] can one understand it though we cannot
[1:23:24] do that we can accept it by faith for
[1:23:29] God hath spoken it and you know this
[1:23:32] just made me think about Hebrews 11:
[1:23:36] 6 if you want to turn with me there for
[1:23:38] a second
[1:23:40] Hebrews
[1:23:42] 11 verse 6 how can one understand it in
[1:23:48] fact in her is summed up and manifested
[1:23:52] the eternal Eternal wisdom and purpose
[1:23:53] of
[1:23:55] God he's not talking about someone else
[1:23:57] brothers and sisters he's talking about
[1:23:59] us tonight he's talking about you he's
[1:24:01] talking about me everyone who's able to
[1:24:03] believe this word everyone who has the
[1:24:05] Holy Ghost in their
[1:24:09] lives summed up and manifested the
[1:24:12] Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how
[1:24:15] can one fathom it how can one understand
[1:24:19] it though we cannot do that we can
[1:24:22] understand understand it how could we
[1:24:24] ever understand it we accept it by faith
[1:24:26] for God hath spoken it and what does
[1:24:28] Hebrews 11:6 say but without faith it's
[1:24:32] impossible to please him for he that
[1:24:36] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:24:40] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:24:42] diligently seek him yes so if we don't
[1:24:45] diligently seek Him how are we ever
[1:24:48] going to have the faith we want to be
[1:24:51] able to please him we want want to have
[1:24:52] that Faith this is the life of a
[1:24:54] Christian of a believer in this day we
[1:24:57] have to accept it by
[1:24:59] faith paragraph 58 but not only is the
[1:25:03] Candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold
[1:25:06] handcrafted of beaten gold according to
[1:25:09] her blueprints which were spirit-given
[1:25:11] and we read that verse in Exodus
[1:25:15] 25:31 Spirit given remember revealed by
[1:25:19] the spirit confirmed by the word but it
[1:25:22] Bears manifest it it shows it manifests
[1:25:26] outside of her Lord and Master Jesus
[1:25:29] Christ was ever a people so beaten and
[1:25:32] purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] surely she is filling up the sufferings
[1:25:37] of Christ has left behind her goods are
[1:25:41] despoiled her life is in Jeopardy she is
[1:25:44] accounted as a sheep for the slaughter
[1:25:46] she is killed all the day long brothers
[1:25:49] and sisters if you think that maybe
[1:25:51] that's not you take a look at the amount
[1:25:53] of pressure that we have to deal with in
[1:25:55] our lives what is the amount of
[1:25:57] Oppression that we have we know that
[1:25:59] there's all kinds of devils roaming
[1:26:02] around trying to torment each and every
[1:26:04] one of us he goes on to say she suffers
[1:26:07] much but in it all retaliates not
[1:26:12] neither does she cause others to suffer
[1:26:14] because we know how does the suffering
[1:26:15] come com through other people the
[1:26:17] devil's getting other people and they go
[1:26:19] and start poking and prodding and saying
[1:26:20] things they'll slice and dice with their
[1:26:23] mouths but what does the bride do she
[1:26:25] doesn't retaliate she doesn't try to
[1:26:27] make anybody feel bad she doesn't want
[1:26:29] to do that because the you know the word
[1:26:31] says this he says here in this paragraph
[1:26:34] worthy of the Gospel is this lovely
[1:26:36] bride of Christ and we know those who
[1:26:39] are are are faithful in Christ Jesus
[1:26:41] will suffer a lot of
[1:26:43] persecution and and sadly it doesn't
[1:26:46] come from without he goes on to say and
[1:26:49] as the gold is malleable whereas brass
[1:26:51] will bre break with the
[1:26:53] beating this gold of God will bear her
[1:26:57] suffering for the
[1:26:59] Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed
[1:27:04] but forming as a thing of beauty and a
[1:27:07] joy Forever by the trials and testings
[1:27:10] of this
[1:27:13] life you know sometimes we can get a
[1:27:15] little bit brassy in our walk we can get
[1:27:17] a little bit brassy in our disposition
[1:27:20] in our thinking in our ways and you know
[1:27:22] what if the Lord can't actually mold us
[1:27:25] and bend us what will happen is we'll
[1:27:27] break we'll break under that
[1:27:30] pressure we're all going to suffer
[1:27:34] persecution Christ Praises his own
[1:27:37] Revelations 2: 2 to3 I Know Thy works
[1:27:40] and thy labor and thy patience and how
[1:27:42] thou CST not bear them which are evil
[1:27:45] and thou Hast tried them which say they
[1:27:48] are Apostles and are not and Hast found
[1:27:51] them like liars and Hast borne and Hast
[1:27:54] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:27:56] labored and Hast not
[1:27:59] fainted now brother bradam really digs
[1:28:01] in here this is where it starts getting
[1:28:03] good how beautifully the Savior praises
[1:28:07] and commends his children he takes full
[1:28:10] account of their fine spiritual
[1:28:13] attitudes and behavior you know I uh I
[1:28:17] was saying to the boys I don't know if I
[1:28:19] said it on Sunday or not I I meant to if
[1:28:21] I didn't but if I said it just forgive
[1:28:23] me and and go along with me you know
[1:28:26] what our attitude will dictate our
[1:28:29] altitude you've probably all heard that
[1:28:31] we've all heard it before but our
[1:28:33] attitude in any situation will dictate
[1:28:35] what our altitude is going to be if we
[1:28:37] have a terrible attitude we're going to
[1:28:39] stay right down here on the ground but
[1:28:41] if we've got an attitude saying Lord
[1:28:43] just be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:28:45] you have it all under control his
[1:28:47] attitude in us will take us into another
[1:28:50] dimension amen how beautifully the
[1:28:53] Savior praises and commends his children
[1:28:55] he takes full account of their fine
[1:28:58] spiritual attitudes and behavior he
[1:29:01] knows that there is weakness amongst
[1:29:03] them but as yet he does not cry out
[1:29:06] against it isn't that just like the
[1:29:10] Lord great my I grew up in in a
[1:29:14] Pentecostal teaching thinking that today
[1:29:16] I I I'm saved but tomorrow I'm going to
[1:29:18] go out and probably fall down I sure
[1:29:20] would like to be saved tomorrow but as
[1:29:22] soon as I fall down I'm going to be
[1:29:24] slapped around by this Lord that I I
[1:29:26] serve or try to anyways and that's not
[1:29:28] the Lord that we serve that's the
[1:29:30] devil's teaching that's a denominational
[1:29:34] devil that's the one that's found to be
[1:29:36] a liar in this verse here that we read
[1:29:39] in Revelations
[1:29:41] 2 he knows how to encourage Us in the
[1:29:44] right matters and discourage Us in the
[1:29:47] wrong matters isn't that
[1:29:50] beautiful amen we could all learn a good
[1:29:54] lesson right here in running the church
[1:29:57] and our
[1:29:58] families not slapping one another right
[1:30:02] not coming to one another in love and
[1:30:05] and actually destroying one another with
[1:30:07] hurtful words but to actually just
[1:30:11] simply encourage in the things that need
[1:30:13] to be encouraged and just simply
[1:30:15] discouraging in the things that
[1:30:16] discourage you know saying you know
[1:30:18] maybe we shouldn't do it that way maybe
[1:30:20] we should actually think about doing
[1:30:22] things
[1:30:23] differently I just love this we could
[1:30:25] all learn a good lesson right here in
[1:30:26] running the church and our families and
[1:30:28] better still we could all learn a good
[1:30:30] lesson and that God deals with each one
[1:30:33] of us in exactly this way don't ever be
[1:30:36] discouraged saint of God for God is not
[1:30:39] ungracious to forget your labors of Love
[1:30:42] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[1:30:45] water to someone has a reward and
[1:30:47] blessing from the Lord amen I Know Thy
[1:30:50] Works thy labor thy patience as he walks
[1:30:53] in the midst of his church he is aware
[1:30:56] of the suffering of his people and he
[1:31:00] cares my as it was in the days of the
[1:31:03] Captivity in Egypt when he heard their
[1:31:06] cries he who never changes still hears
[1:31:10] the cries of the oppressed as he walks
[1:31:13] amongst them the very word labor
[1:31:16] signifies weariness through
[1:31:19] oppression God's people do not only work
[1:31:22] for him in a labor of love amen but they
[1:31:25] suffer for him with joy they are patient
[1:31:29] in bearing the
[1:31:32] Yoke this first age suffered great
[1:31:36] persecution it had to work hard to
[1:31:39] preach the gospel and shed forth
[1:31:41] truth their High Calling in life was to
[1:31:44] serve God and when their hopes in life
[1:31:48] were blighted as they were patient and
[1:31:51] and committed all to him who had
[1:31:54] promised a lasting recompense in heaven
[1:31:57] for what they had given up for him on
[1:31:59] Earth he says I think we ought to stop
[1:32:02] here and deal with the thought that
[1:32:04] God's people have always been and always
[1:32:09] will be
[1:32:10] persecuted you know that Genesis is the
[1:32:13] book of
[1:32:14] beginnings and what you find started
[1:32:17] there will carry right on through the
[1:32:20] revelation and never
[1:32:23] change there we see that Cain persecuted
[1:32:27] and killed Abel because the latter
[1:32:30] pleased God we know the story Cain was
[1:32:34] given instruction and he just couldn't
[1:32:36] ref he couldn't accept it he was given
[1:32:38] the opportunity to repent but he just
[1:32:40] refused
[1:32:41] it we know he goes on to say then we see
[1:32:44] a perfect picture in Abraham son of the
[1:32:46] flesh ishel who teased and fought the
[1:32:49] son of Promise Isaac and there was Esau
[1:32:53] who hated Jacob and would have killed
[1:32:55] him but we know that God said Esau have
[1:32:59] I hated and Jacob have I
[1:33:01] loved he says had not God
[1:33:04] intervened in the New Testament we find
[1:33:07] Judas betraying Jesus while religious
[1:33:09] orders of the first century attempted to
[1:33:12] destroy the early Believers the children
[1:33:14] of this world controlled by the devil
[1:33:17] hate the children of God who are
[1:33:20] controlled by the Spirit
[1:33:23] yes I just think that's so important
[1:33:26] brothers and sisters it's going to be
[1:33:28] something that we have to contend
[1:33:31] with but you know there's still going to
[1:33:33] be hate it doesn't matter if you're of
[1:33:36] the devil it's hate amen people hate one
[1:33:40] another all the time yes but if we're
[1:33:43] going to be hated we might as well be
[1:33:45] hated for the right
[1:33:50] thing my
[1:33:52] I just think it's so beautiful how we
[1:33:53] have this wonderful promise
[1:33:57] here um soy bear with me for a second
[1:34:09] here then we okay uh there we go
[1:34:13] paragraph 64 no matter how just and
[1:34:18] upright a Christian is before the public
[1:34:20] and how graci ious he is to his fellow
[1:34:23] man doing not but good let him confess
[1:34:27] Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the
[1:34:30] operation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:33] in tongues prophecy healing and miracles
[1:34:35] and he will be condemned many people
[1:34:38] confess Christ as their savior but boy
[1:34:41] when you start talking about the spirit
[1:34:43] and the manifestation of the fruit of
[1:34:44] the spirit in your life then you're
[1:34:47] going to actually suffer that's when it
[1:34:49] comes on the spirit of of this world
[1:34:52] hates the spirit of God and because it
[1:34:55] can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it
[1:34:57] tries to destroy the vessel in whom the
[1:35:01] spirit of Truth
[1:35:03] dwells persecution and trials are a
[1:35:06] natural normal part of the Christian
[1:35:09] Life there is only one thing you can do
[1:35:12] about them commit them all to God judge
[1:35:16] not and leave their outworking and final
[1:35:20] judgment to him
[1:35:22] don't try and do it on your own we can't
[1:35:24] do it on our own we don't want to judge
[1:35:26] one another we don't want to judge the
[1:35:27] ranked Sinners the people that would
[1:35:29] persecute us even when our brother or
[1:35:31] our sister does it we don't want to
[1:35:33] judge them maybe they just got ill you
[1:35:37] know brothers and sisters we catch colds
[1:35:39] naturally sometimes we can catch a
[1:35:41] spiritual cold and we just need some
[1:35:44] time to heal we need some time to get
[1:35:47] over it we need some time to develop
[1:35:48] some spiritual
[1:35:50] antibodies as that's why it's important
[1:35:52] to pray for one another because when we
[1:35:54] do that we'll see overcoming power in
[1:35:57] our brothers and sisters lives right
[1:36:00] paragraph 66 thou cast not bear them
[1:36:02] which are evil and thou Hast tried them
[1:36:05] which say they are Apostles and are not
[1:36:08] and has found them
[1:36:10] Liars these Ephesians believed that
[1:36:13] God's people ought to be
[1:36:15] holy according to this verse they took
[1:36:18] steps to keep the body unleavened from
[1:36:21] sin most evidently the apostasy had
[1:36:24] already started sin had entered into the
[1:36:27] church but they were obedient to the
[1:36:29] words of Paul when he said to put away
[1:36:33] the wicked from amongst them they were a
[1:36:36] separated people they had come out of
[1:36:38] the world and now they weren't going to
[1:36:41] let the world enter amongst them now
[1:36:45] brothers and sisters I'm not talking
[1:36:47] about our brothers and sisters here I
[1:36:49] don't think brother Bram is talking
[1:36:50] about that either when we've had a real
[1:36:52] experience when we've been able to
[1:36:54] understand people in this world that
[1:36:56] don't believe this word they're evil and
[1:36:59] you know what they might not have
[1:37:00] malicious intent but you're either under
[1:37:03] the influence of the Holy Spirit or
[1:37:05] you're under the influence of the mark
[1:37:06] of the beast those are the only two
[1:37:08] Spirits at work in this world yes but
[1:37:12] once we've come into the church once we
[1:37:14] recognize the goodness the grace of God
[1:37:16] under the messenger of this age William
[1:37:19] Mary and Bram the prophet for our age
[1:37:22] once we recognize that just like Paul
[1:37:24] was the messenger to the Ephesian Church
[1:37:26] age then we push aside all of that
[1:37:28] worldly influence we don't want nothing
[1:37:30] to do with that you become a separated
[1:37:33] person when you recognize the grace of
[1:37:35] God you don't go and run with your your
[1:37:37] school friends who do worldly things
[1:37:40] that turn out to be sinful things you
[1:37:42] don't go and do that you actually
[1:37:44] separate yourself you don't take your
[1:37:47] families to sinful places and events we
[1:37:50] don't watch sinful things we don't
[1:37:52] listen to sinful things we're a
[1:37:54] separated
[1:37:55] people they had come out of the world
[1:37:58] and now they weren't going to let the
[1:37:59] world enter amongst them brothers and
[1:38:03] sisters that's why I preach the Holy
[1:38:04] Ghost that's why I preach it over and
[1:38:06] over and over again because I know that
[1:38:08] the world will not want one part of that
[1:38:11] Holy Ghost but the Saints
[1:38:14] do they would not put up with sin in the
[1:38:17] church Holiness wasn't a phrase with
[1:38:19] them or a figure of speech it was a way
[1:38:22] of life and we know brothers and sisters
[1:38:25] that the law
[1:38:27] kth doesn't it the letter kth but the
[1:38:31] spirit giveth life amen and when you
[1:38:34] live under a a a a ministry that's dos
[1:38:37] and don'ts whether it's a man's idea or
[1:38:41] or whether it's according to the word of
[1:38:43] God and it's only taken you through
[1:38:44] justification all the way up to
[1:38:46] sanctification and you just live a
[1:38:48] legalistic perspective you're only ever
[1:38:50] going to go go that far right you'll
[1:38:53] never have the spirit the dynamic Holy
[1:38:55] Ghost living in your life
[1:38:58] right paragraph 67 thou Hast tried them
[1:39:01] that
[1:39:02] say they are
[1:39:04] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:39:08] Liars it just really struck me that part
[1:39:11] of the verse brothers and sisters
[1:39:13] because if they truly were believers
[1:39:16] they would just be fellowshipping and
[1:39:18] their lives would manifest The Works of
[1:39:20] God wouldn't they
[1:39:21] they wouldn't have to say to anybody
[1:39:23] that I'm a Believer they wouldn't have
[1:39:26] to say they are an apostle brother
[1:39:29] bradam he says Thou H has tried them
[1:39:31] that say they are Apostles and are not
[1:39:34] and H has found them Liars he says my
[1:39:36] that is a blunt statement thou Hast
[1:39:38] tried them who call themselves Apostles
[1:39:41] and what is an apostle it's a sent one
[1:39:43] isn't that
[1:39:45] presumptuous what right has a people to
[1:39:48] try those who call themselves apostles
[1:39:51] and how do they try them oh I love this
[1:39:53] here it is isn't this beautiful the way
[1:39:55] he does it he's not saying that that we
[1:39:58] can just say oh my I I'm going to call
[1:40:01] someone a liar there's a benchmark there
[1:40:03] is a a a ruler there is a standard and
[1:40:07] he he says it Galatians 1:8 but though
[1:40:10] we or an angel from heaven preach any
[1:40:11] other gospel unto you than that which we
[1:40:13] have already preached unto you let him
[1:40:15] be accursed paragraph 68 it was the
[1:40:18] apostles who brought the original word
[1:40:20] to the people
[1:40:21] that original word could not change not
[1:40:24] even a DOT a dash of it or a dash of it
[1:40:29] Paul knew it was God who had spoken to
[1:40:32] him so he said even if I come and try
[1:40:35] and give a second
[1:40:39] Revelation try to make one little change
[1:40:42] in what I gave
[1:40:44] original let me be a
[1:40:49] cursed I think we heard it said I I
[1:40:51] remember brother Toby said it I think
[1:40:53] his dad said it someone said it brother
[1:40:56] Toby mentioned that you know if brother
[1:40:58] brandham came back and said you know
[1:40:59] what I got a different Revelation I'm so
[1:41:01] sorry if he came back from the dead and
[1:41:03] we saw him as a spirit or something I'm
[1:41:05] so sorry I've got another Revelation as
[1:41:07] Believers sorry buddy we believe what
[1:41:10] Paul preached and we're not going to
[1:41:12] accept anything
[1:41:14] else even if someone came back from the
[1:41:16] dead an angel yes even if come and try
[1:41:21] to give a second Revelation try to make
[1:41:24] one little change in what I gave
[1:41:26] originally let me be a cursed you see
[1:41:29] Paul knew that the first revelation was
[1:41:32] correct God couldn't give a first
[1:41:34] revelation then a second Revelation if
[1:41:37] he did he would be changing his
[1:41:40] mind and we know brother bradam he
[1:41:42] preaches a message does God ever change
[1:41:44] his
[1:41:45] mind so important to hear that
[1:41:49] one paragraph 69 n he can give a
[1:41:53] revelation and then add to it he did in
[1:41:57] the Garden of Eden when he promised the
[1:41:58] seed to the
[1:42:00] woman and then later designated that
[1:42:03] seed had to come through Abraham and
[1:42:06] then later said it would come by the
[1:42:09] same Bloodlines in David but it was the
[1:42:13] same Revelation yes it only gave the
[1:42:16] people more information to help them
[1:42:20] receive an understand it but God's word
[1:42:23] can't change the seed came exactly as
[1:42:27] revealed
[1:42:29] Hallelujah and see what those false
[1:42:31] apostles were doing they came with their
[1:42:35] own
[1:42:37] word those Ephesians knew that word as
[1:42:42] Paul had taught it there were full of
[1:42:45] the Holy Ghost by laying on of Paul's
[1:42:47] hands they looked those false prophets
[1:42:49] in the eye and said you are not saying
[1:42:52] what Paul said you therefore are
[1:42:57] false I just love that because you know
[1:43:00] brothers and sisters we have the
[1:43:03] obligation as Spirit-filled Holy Ghost
[1:43:06] filled Believers the elected bride of
[1:43:08] Jesus Christ to know where we stand upon
[1:43:11] this word and if someone is preaching
[1:43:13] not what Paul preached it is Our
[1:43:16] obligation to be just like those True
[1:43:18] Believers in the Ephesian Church age to
[1:43:21] look at those men and say to them to
[1:43:24] their face in their eyes you are off the
[1:43:26] word you're not preaching what Paul
[1:43:30] preached and you know brother bradam he
[1:43:32] says it to stay with your pastor stick
[1:43:34] with your pastor he'll lead you through
[1:43:36] and now absolutely right but what
[1:43:38] happens when a pastor's off the
[1:43:41] word can you have a conversation with
[1:43:44] them can you say hey buddy I don't know
[1:43:46] I just want to talk to you and have a
[1:43:49] conversation
[1:43:51] and you know what happens right quick if
[1:43:53] that brother is truly of the spirit of
[1:43:55] the Lord he's going to say
[1:43:57] my please tell me I want to have a
[1:43:59] conversation about this I want to be on
[1:44:01] the word yes I know that I I have the
[1:44:04] spirit that Jesus Christ gave me and
[1:44:06] it's it's gold and it's designed to be
[1:44:09] beaten and molded but it's not brass
[1:44:13] it's not just going to snap and break as
[1:44:14] soon as something comes against
[1:44:16] it but we know that's the true
[1:44:20] definition of a false Apostle someone
[1:44:22] that actually brings something different
[1:44:24] and remember those people
[1:44:26] probably intend to be true intend to
[1:44:30] have the right
[1:44:31] motive but if they don't have the right
[1:44:34] Spirit they'll never be able to bring
[1:44:36] the right
[1:44:37] word that's why we have to know the word
[1:44:39] brothers and sisters we've got to have
[1:44:41] the spirit of Christ you don't have to
[1:44:43] memorize every single verse you don't
[1:44:45] have to know the whole entire message
[1:44:46] you have to know the author of both of
[1:44:48] those and if you know the author of both
[1:44:51] of those he the spirit of Truth when he
[1:44:53] comes on the scene when he comes in your
[1:44:55] life he will lead you and guide you into
[1:44:57] all
[1:44:58] truth and he'll give you the ability to
[1:45:01] have courage to go and say hey buddy
[1:45:03] you're preaching not what Paul preached
[1:45:06] and that brother if he is a true seed
[1:45:07] he'll say oh my forgive me that's right
[1:45:11] right amen you will but Bram says oh
[1:45:15] that sets my heart on fire get back to
[1:45:17] the word it's not that you re it's not
[1:45:21] it is not you that really tries the
[1:45:25] Apostle and the prophet and the teacher
[1:45:29] it is the word that tries
[1:45:32] them and that just sets my heart on fire
[1:45:35] brothers and sisters as I was going
[1:45:37] through this I thought you know when I
[1:45:39] first heard about the message of the
[1:45:41] hour I thought this guy and and and
[1:45:43] being able to discern the hearts of
[1:45:45] people and how I would never ever ever
[1:45:48] put myself in front of that man because
[1:45:50] of of all the terrible things that I did
[1:45:52] in my life and I knew who I was and I
[1:45:53] didn't want anybody else to know about
[1:45:55] and I'm sure that many people could say
[1:45:57] Amen to that but you don't have to but
[1:45:59] we know who we are on the innermost
[1:46:01] innermost of our lives and who would
[1:46:03] want someone to look through your heart
[1:46:05] and discern you and be able to say
[1:46:07] exactly where you've been what you've
[1:46:09] done and how much you've done it what a
[1:46:13] terrible thing that would be but my
[1:46:15] goodness when you truly get filled with
[1:46:17] the Holy Ghost you say hey I would love
[1:46:19] to sit with a man like that because I
[1:46:20] just want one word for him to say you're
[1:46:22] truly a Christian just like that
[1:46:24] testimony of sister Bruce in the private
[1:46:26] interview I've seen you under
[1:46:28] discernment and I know that you're a
[1:46:30] real Christian you're a real believer
[1:46:32] just like those Saints back at Ephesus
[1:46:35] amen it's not us that judges people it's
[1:46:38] not those people in Ephesus that judge
[1:46:41] the false Apostles it's the word that
[1:46:43] judges
[1:46:45] them and the True Believer will always
[1:46:47] get in line with the word but the one
[1:46:50] who is a false Apostle he'll say no no
[1:46:52] no you you're wrong you're off I've got
[1:46:54] the right Revelation and unless you
[1:46:56] follow me you're going to burn and you
[1:46:59] know I'm saying it that way I'm just
[1:47:01] just
[1:47:03] uh by I just get excited with this here
[1:47:06] brother ROM he says it if you don't get
[1:47:08] it if you don't follow the word then
[1:47:10] you're lost that's what he
[1:47:12] says paragraph 71 one of these days
[1:47:15] there's going to come a prophet to the
[1:47:17] leoan church age and you will know if he
[1:47:19] is the one sent from God or not yes you
[1:47:23] will I'm so glad that we can say we're
[1:47:25] one of them hey we were singing that on
[1:47:28] the weekend and it just made my heart so
[1:47:30] happy so much joy to say I'm so glad
[1:47:34] that I can say I'm one of them because I
[1:47:36] never did it I never did it in the first
[1:47:38] place he's the one that did it and for
[1:47:40] me to be able to recognize that for us
[1:47:42] to be able to recognize that brothers
[1:47:43] and sisters there should not be a quiet
[1:47:46] person in a worship service if you know
[1:47:48] that you're one of them right amen my he
[1:47:52] says yes you will you'll recognize it
[1:47:55] for if he is of God he will be in that
[1:47:57] word exactly as God gave it to Paul
[1:48:02] isn't that beautiful we've got a
[1:48:03] benchmark brothers and sisters and that
[1:48:06] this is what did it for me this is where
[1:48:08] I could I could preach man this is what
[1:48:10] gets me excited this sets my heart on
[1:48:11] fire because where else could we go but
[1:48:14] to the word of God Amen what other Plum
[1:48:17] line do we have in this world in this
[1:48:19] universe
[1:48:21] there's nothing else we can we were
[1:48:23] talking about on the weekend you know we
[1:48:24] got the Book of Mormon we could say you
[1:48:26] know we've got another
[1:48:28] book Jehovah's Witness we've got some
[1:48:31] other other other Amendment or addendum
[1:48:33] to the word of God now some people might
[1:48:35] say well brother Barry that that book
[1:48:37] that you got that that so-called Prophet
[1:48:39] wrote the the exposition of the seven
[1:48:41] Church ages but what is he saying in
[1:48:43] here continually over and over and over
[1:48:45] again by the spirit go back to the word
[1:48:48] get back to the word get in line with
[1:48:50] the word what other Plum line is there
[1:48:53] in this
[1:48:54] world I better call them musicians for
[1:48:57] if he is of God he will be in that word
[1:49:00] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[1:49:03] deviate it from that word for a moment
[1:49:06] not by one
[1:49:09] ioda now I'm like man I got to look that
[1:49:12] up what is Iota what is iota mean it's
[1:49:15] the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet
[1:49:17] an extremely small amount yes he won't
[1:49:20] deviate one extremely small amount he'll
[1:49:24] stay exactly on that word in the last
[1:49:27] age when where there will be many false
[1:49:29] prophets appearing watch and see how
[1:49:32] they will keep telling you that if you
[1:49:34] don't believe them and what they say you
[1:49:38] will be
[1:49:40] lost the identification of a false
[1:49:44] prophet and will he accept correction by
[1:49:46] the word that's the identification of a
[1:49:49] true true seed of God right the false
[1:49:53] prophet will say wrong I've got the edge
[1:49:57] you're not going to teach me nothing
[1:49:59] you're not going to tell me nothing I've
[1:50:00] been in the message for however many
[1:50:04] years but a true seed of God if they are
[1:50:07] off if they are wrong they'll say Lord
[1:50:09] have mercy on my soul let me get right
[1:50:13] back in line with that word let me
[1:50:14] repent and go back to my first
[1:50:18] love but he said says watch and see how
[1:50:21] they keep telling you that if you don't
[1:50:23] believe them and what they say you'll be
[1:50:26] lost and I I learned it early on when I
[1:50:28] started coming around the message of the
[1:50:30] of the hour I had no idea about this but
[1:50:32] you know what I call it I call it a a
[1:50:34] Ministry of
[1:50:35] fear it's a Ministry of fear because
[1:50:39] what those false Apostles do those false
[1:50:41] prophets they they scare people into
[1:50:43] following them if you don't follow me
[1:50:45] the way that I teach it my goodness
[1:50:47] you're going to be lost but you know
[1:50:49] what
[1:50:51] just follow the word of God and see if
[1:50:54] he won't lead you and guide you into all
[1:50:58] truth he says but when that last day
[1:51:01] Prophet comes on the scene if he is
[1:51:03] truly that prophet he will be crying out
[1:51:07] get back to the word or you are
[1:51:11] lost not follow me not follow my book
[1:51:15] not follow my teachings my Revelation my
[1:51:18] theories my traditions my
[1:51:22] ideas get back to the word or you're
[1:51:25] lost he won't build on a private
[1:51:28] Revelation or interpretation but on the
[1:51:31] word amen and amen I'm so sorry I just
[1:51:34] want to I want to preach now I'm going
[1:51:36] to I'm going to stop there we'll pick up
[1:51:39] on paragraph 72 and uh maybe do a little
[1:51:42] recap next week God richly bless you as
[1:51:45] we go forwards I just trust brothers and
[1:51:47] sisters that we could be encouraged by
[1:51:49] this that we will be able to have the
[1:51:51] identification of a false prophet in our
[1:51:53] lives that we'll understand there's only
[1:51:55] one Plum line and that is the word of
[1:51:58] God that's the only absolute that we've
[1:52:00] got that's our North Star and and if we
[1:52:03] take the compass in our lives of this
[1:52:05] word and just take a look at it it will
