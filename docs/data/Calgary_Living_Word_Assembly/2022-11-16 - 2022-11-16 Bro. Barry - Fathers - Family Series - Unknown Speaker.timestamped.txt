[36:52] you are our healer and father we pray
[36:54] that you would just reveal yourself to
[36:55] each one Lord Jesus one more time that
[36:58] you are our healer father and we know
[37:00] that nothing can reveal that to us like
[37:04] getting sick Lord Jesus unfortunately
[37:06] it's the way we are in this flesh Lord
[37:08] we know this flesh has to perish this
[37:10] flesh will never ever make it to see O
[37:14] Lord Jesus Your Glory but we know that
[37:16] you already have a body waiting for us

[37:55] God bless you tonight thank you
[37:57] musicians thank you brother Toby for
[37:59] stepping in
[38:01] found ourselves with a
[38:03] lack of a piano player tonight
[38:06] but we know the lord always provides
[38:10] tonight I just want to
[38:12] kind of go into the family discussion
[38:15] again if you could turn with fee in your
[38:16] Bibles to Ephesians chapter 5.
[38:20] I just want to kind of go back to where
[38:23] where we were some time ago
[38:28] talking about families
[38:38] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21.
[38:44] submitting yourselves one to another in
[38:46] the fear of God
[38:49] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[38:51] husbands as unto the Lord
[38:54] for the husband is the head of the wife
[38:55] even as Christ is the head of the church
[38:59] and he is the savior of the body
[39:02] therefore as the church is subject unto
[39:04] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[39:06] husbands in everything
[39:09] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[39:11] also loved the church and gave himself
[39:14] for it
[39:15] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[39:17] with the washing of the Water by the
[39:19] word
[39:20] that he might present it to himself
[39:23] a glorious church not having spot or
[39:25] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[39:27] should be holy and without blemish
[39:30] so ought men to love their wives as
[39:32] their own bodies
[39:34] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[39:36] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[39:39] but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[39:42] even as the Lord the church
[39:45] for we are members of his body of his
[39:48] flesh and of his bones
[39:50] for this cause shall a man leave his
[39:52] father and mother and shall be joined
[39:54] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[39:57] flesh
[39:58] this is a great mystery
[40:00] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[40:03] church
[40:04] nevertheless let every one of you in
[40:06] particular so love his wife even as
[40:09] himself
[40:10] and the wife see that she reverence her
[40:13] husband
[40:14] children
[40:15] obey your parents and the Lord for this
[40:17] is right
[40:18] honor thy father and mother which is the
[40:21] first commandment with promise that it
[40:23] may be well with thee and thou mayest
[40:25] live long on the Earth
[40:27] and ye fathers
[40:29] provoke not your children to Wrath
[40:32] but bring them up in the nurture and
[40:35] admonition of the Lord
[40:37] let's just bow one more time
[40:39] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we pray
[40:42] that we could just follow your word we
[40:45] pray that you would just take this word
[40:47] this word of life that we've read
[40:49] tonight father and that you would break
[40:50] it open to us fresh once again father
[40:53] that it would truly be our anchor point
[40:55] that it would truly be our Compass Lord
[40:58] that it would truly be our North Star
[41:01] because we know that you are the word
[41:03] father and we pray that Lord Jesus we
[41:06] could take this word into our heart
[41:07] tonight and that your spirit would come
[41:09] by here and Quicken it to us father that
[41:12] it would Quicken it to our souls we just
[41:14] ask that you would bless our service now
[41:16] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[41:19] bless you tonight you may be seated
[41:22] it's like to welcome back everyone who
[41:24] was traveling there was a few people
[41:25] away
[41:27] certainly good to see you again
[41:30] I just have a couple of announcements we
[41:33] have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening
[41:36] here at the church we have the youth
[41:37] event Friday evening and we have a
[41:39] communion service on Sunday evening
[41:43] and uh
[41:45] yeah I do believe that we have brother
[41:48] Mervin taking the service next week is
[41:50] that right
[41:51] we have made a change but that's what's
[41:54] going to happen
[41:55] um
[41:56] yeah so certainly excited to see what
[41:59] the Lord has put upon our brother's
[42:01] heart
[42:01] and see what will happen
[42:04] sir enjoyed the service last week with
[42:06] brother Gilbert that was a wonderful
[42:07] service
[42:09] and certainly inspired me for last
[42:11] Sunday and next Sunday there's a lot
[42:15] there to talk about we've heard that
[42:17] Jubilee trumpet we've heard the freedom
[42:20] Bells we understand who we are and where
[42:23] we are at
[42:27] um just want to remember the youth
[42:28] banquet it's confirmed for November the
[42:30] 26th sorry for any confusion out there
[42:32] we
[42:34] had a little bit of a hiccup but we've
[42:36] got it figured out so we're going to go
[42:38] ahead with it and I trust it will be a
[42:39] blessing to everyone brother Toby has
[42:42] agreed to take the service for us there
[42:45] and we're excited to do that I believe
[42:47] it's going to be hosted at the shepherd
[42:48] Hall brother could you turn down the
[42:50] monitor again I believe there's a bit of
[42:52] an echo somehow
[42:54] I uh thank you I don't really need
[42:57] monitor myself
[43:00] um are you happy tonight
[43:02] just want to maybe get into talking
[43:04] about our family roles and maybe recap
[43:07] again and I apologize but I think it's
[43:09] just so critical in a day in which we
[43:12] live you know brother Branham talked
[43:14] about it how if if Satan could break
[43:16] motherhood then he could break the
[43:18] backbone of a nation and it's so
[43:21] important to recognize what Satan's
[43:22] desire is and that is to destroy the
[43:24] family and we can look around and see so
[43:28] many destroyed families it's just it's
[43:30] terrible and maybe I'm a little
[43:32] passionate about it myself because I
[43:34] come from a broken family I understand
[43:36] the implications of it and sort of what
[43:38] the repercussions can be in certain
[43:40] situations and it's not pretty and we
[43:43] know that that's probably one of Satan's
[43:45] greatest victories is to destroy
[43:47] families destroy marriages
[43:49] and so uh I just want to encourage us as
[43:53] family members those who are fathers
[43:56] those who are mothers those who are
[43:58] husbands and wives those who are
[44:00] children maybe even grandparents what
[44:04] what what is this all about why are we
[44:06] even here I think it's just a tremendous
[44:09] thought
[44:10] is to have a family
[44:11] that's the reason we're here and many
[44:14] people would say they've got all kinds
[44:15] of different Ambitions but once you get
[44:17] the spirit of the Lord when you eat the
[44:20] book and then his Spirit comes by and
[44:21] quickens it to you what happens
[44:23] something changes in your life and it's
[44:26] not what maybe you would think
[44:28] which is beautiful
[44:30] but you know I uh I just wanted to go
[44:32] back and and just remind us remember
[44:34] Ephesians parallels Joshua we talked
[44:36] about it for so long about going over
[44:39] and conquering uh the enemy getting into
[44:41] our promised land and knowing that when
[44:42] we're in our Promised Land we have total
[44:45] Victory there's no enemy that can stand
[44:47] before us but what I want to do is
[44:49] actually start to bring that right into
[44:50] the discussion now talking about
[44:52] families and and just to remind us that
[44:54] if we want to be conquering an enemy in
[44:57] our lives if we have an enemy that's
[44:59] attacking us who has an enemy that's
[45:00] attacking you I don't think anybody here
[45:03] is exclusive from that nobody is exempt
[45:05] from that we are created to be tempted
[45:08] and tried because God wants to work out
[45:10] his character in us he wants to squeeze
[45:12] out that DNA that Gene seed of God that
[45:15] he placed in us before the foundation of
[45:16] the world but if we want to conquer the
[45:18] enemy in our Promised Land we need to be
[45:21] in our position just like soldiers need
[45:23] to be in their position I can't say if
[45:26] I'm in a in a war that I want to be the
[45:29] pilot of the plane when I've Been Told
[45:30] old and trained to be the tail Gunner
[45:33] I'm probably the most likely to die in
[45:36] the situation but that's what I was
[45:37] trained to do so I need to go and be in
[45:39] my position if I'm not in my position as
[45:41] a tail Gunner that plane could actually
[45:43] wind up crashing because someone isn't
[45:45] doing their job we need to make sure
[45:47] that we are in our positions
[45:49] the wives to see our husbands husbands
[45:53] see our wives we don't have any busy
[45:55] pointing fingers and saying my wife my
[45:57] wife my wife or my husband or my husband
[45:58] or my husband what about us in our
[46:01] positions are we in our spot if we're in
[46:04] our spot then we go on our knees and we
[46:06] say prayers for something going on in
[46:09] our family God's going to honor our
[46:11] prayers but if we get self-righteous and
[46:13] we get prideful and say no your position
[46:16] is this and you need to be doing that
[46:18] because that's according to the word
[46:19] we're getting out of our position
[46:21] we're not going to be able to see our
[46:23] prayers answered the way that we think
[46:25] they will be we'll wind up in a trial
[46:27] again we'll wind up with whatever that
[46:29] situation is rising up and coming back
[46:31] to haunt us
[46:33] so we want to just remember that
[46:34] Ephesians it parallels Joshua perfectly
[46:36] brother Branham said it's not close he
[46:39] says it perfectly parallels Joshua how
[46:42] are we going to go and possess our
[46:43] Promised Land brothers and sisters
[46:45] we're going to go forwards in our
[46:47] positions the only way we can do that is
[46:49] to be in our positions and you know
[46:51] brothers and sisters if we notice that
[46:53] someone is out of their position why
[46:55] specifically if you notice your husband
[46:56] is out of his position that doesn't give
[46:59] you a right to get out of your position
[47:00] children if you know your parents are
[47:02] out of their position you still have to
[47:04] abide by the word but when you abide by
[47:07] the word and you go to go to God as a
[47:09] child and say heavenly father I'm I'm
[47:12] obeying my parents I'm doing what they
[47:14] told me to do and I don't like it I
[47:16] don't think it's right it's not
[47:17] according to your word because of the
[47:18] way their actions are if you want to see
[47:20] a change in your home as a child if
[47:23] you're in your position and you go to
[47:25] prayer God's going to honor your prayers
[47:28] wives if your husband's out of position
[47:30] you want to go to see God answer your
[47:33] prayers stay in your position
[47:35] you'll be in your position and then ask
[47:37] God to come on the scene and watch him
[47:39] he will
[47:41] what is our Promised Land
[47:43] our promised land is the Holy Ghost
[47:45] Christ in us the hope of glory
[47:49] you know I took a look back and I want
[47:51] to I want to get into husbands
[47:52] specifically tonight so I apologize if
[47:55] it really makes anybody feel
[47:56] uncomfortable I don't want to make
[47:57] anybody uncomfortable I just think we
[48:00] really need to remember the importance
[48:02] of the husbands of the fathers they're
[48:05] the leaders of the home and the whole
[48:07] entire family is dependent on the
[48:09] husbands and it's got nothing to do I'm
[48:11] not even talking about finances many
[48:13] people would say well the finances are
[48:15] the provider and so they're the boss and
[48:16] they've got every right to say
[48:18] everything about it you know what if
[48:19] we're doing that then we're just getting
[48:20] prideful we're getting out of our
[48:22] position right away when we start with
[48:23] that business we're talking about
[48:25] spiritual headships spiritual leadership
[48:28] we have got to be able to be the
[48:30] spiritual leadership for our homes
[48:32] I said Lord help me
[48:34] I'm walking this walk I'm talking it but
[48:37] I'm trying to walk it I have to but you
[48:40] know we can set an atmosphere in our
[48:42] homes and we do
[48:44] you know what's interesting this is an
[48:46] interesting thought I'm just going to
[48:48] throw it out there what we can see is is
[48:51] tremendous when we have children
[48:54] many times children will act one way
[48:57] with their parents and they'll act a
[48:58] totally different way outside of their
[49:00] family totally different why is that
[49:03] because the family the parents set an
[49:06] atmosphere and the children know it the
[49:09] children are the I would say almost the
[49:11] projectors of the atmosphere because
[49:13] they actually they feel it they sense it
[49:16] and they actually live it they they
[49:18] manifest whatever that is whether it's
[49:20] it's Joy whether it's anxiety whether
[49:23] it's fear whatever it is the parents
[49:25] have going on in their lives the the
[49:27] children are going to project it you
[49:28] can't hide it
[49:30] you know brother Branham says that we're
[49:31] creators I'm paraphrasing but when
[49:34] Divine love is projected what happens
[49:36] brothers and sisters
[49:39] if we want to see a change in our lives
[49:41] in our marriage in our families if we
[49:44] want to
[49:45] then we've got an opportunity to do
[49:46] something and I'll even say this we
[49:48] talked about having the the we had the
[49:50] PowerPoint on the screen there I don't
[49:52] know if it was last was it last week or
[49:53] the week before that we had it and we
[49:55] talked about being reverent in the house
[49:57] of the Lord you know we have the
[49:59] opportunity brothers and sisters to
[50:00] project Divine love in the house of the
[50:02] Lord
[50:03] instead of pointing a finger and saying
[50:05] they should do this or they should do
[50:06] that we can actually do something about
[50:08] it ourselves
[50:09] if we're in our position
[50:11] but if we get out of our position it's
[50:13] pretty tough to protect Divine love
[50:15] brother Branham says this out of 1957
[50:17] when Divine love is projected
[50:19] now this is the prophet telling this
[50:21] story and it's a bit long but I hope
[50:24] you'll bear with me I got lots of quotes
[50:26] tonight probably won't even get through
[50:28] them but we'll just see what the Lord
[50:29] will do here
[50:30] brother Bradham says this in our home
[50:34] and try this at your home I
[50:37] I just stopped right there I'm like man
[50:39] this is the seventh angel messenger
[50:41] saying this instruction try this in your
[50:44] home
[50:45] and if there ever was a home that's
[50:48] confused and torn up as much as ours
[50:51] people from everywhere all over the
[50:53] world coming all the time in and out day
[50:55] and night all hours
[50:57] and I have noticed here some time ago my
[50:59] lovely little wife of 37 years old and
[51:02] completely great she stood between me
[51:04] and the public
[51:06] if there's any praises to be given to
[51:07] the Bradham family give it to her
[51:10] the telephone run you wild day and night
[51:12] and our house had been full all day
[51:16] and I went out and my little children
[51:18] little Sarah and Rebecca were fighting
[51:20] over some play blocks little Joseph the
[51:23] baby sitting on the floor screaming to
[51:25] the top of his voice
[51:27] in the kitchen with her face buried in
[51:30] her hands a weeping
[51:33] when I finally got the house emptied
[51:37] some in this room some in that room some
[51:39] in the basement and I walked in and I
[51:42] thought oh what a confusion
[51:45] she put her arms around me she said
[51:46] Billy I'm going crazy
[51:49] she said I haven't been able to get the
[51:51] children any dinner
[51:53] isn't it interesting right there
[51:56] being a man being a husband
[51:59] being in my position
[52:02] you know automatically I would think in
[52:05] my personal carnality
[52:08] as a believer
[52:09] well what were you doing
[52:12] right anybody else out there would be
[52:14] that way or is it just me
[52:16] and she said the children hasn't had
[52:18] anything to eat and I don't know what to
[52:20] do
[52:21] well I thought now there's just one
[52:23] thing to do now I'm tired
[52:26] but I'm going to do this
[52:29] think about this as we read this here's
[52:32] the seventh angel messenger there's
[52:33] people in the basement there's people in
[52:35] the bedrooms there's people all over the
[52:37] house
[52:38] he he giving discernment praying for
[52:40] people who knows how much he had slept
[52:43] here he is saying he's tired many times
[52:46] we'll go to work and we'll come home and
[52:47] say I'm tired where's my food where's my
[52:49] grub
[52:51] and she said the children hasn't had
[52:53] anything to eat and I don't know what to
[52:54] do well I thought now there's just one
[52:56] thing to do now I'm tired but I'm going
[53:00] to do this
[53:01] now heavenly father in my heart you help
[53:04] me to be what you would have me to be on
[53:07] this scene
[53:09] and I thought now if I can just get her
[53:12] quiet
[53:13] so I said Sweetheart would you rush out
[53:15] with me for dinner
[53:17] she said oh I'd I'd have to clean up all
[53:19] the children and this and that and you
[53:21] could hardly hear yourself think little
[53:23] Joseph just beating the floor as hard as
[53:26] he could
[53:28] so I slipped over and got an apron
[53:31] and put it around me
[53:33] and I began to help her
[53:35] and I just want to say this brothers and
[53:37] sisters I'm not saying put on an apron
[53:39] use the other part I began to help her
[53:43] I began to help her I didn't just put it
[53:46] all on her and say it's your problem I'm
[53:48] the provider you're the one that manages
[53:50] the house
[53:52] some might say this is just a prophet's
[53:54] wife of course she's in this situation
[53:56] and it's all bad that way but you know
[53:59] what if we're saying that I'm the
[54:00] provider and she keeps the home whose
[54:03] home is it
[54:04] whose home is it
[54:07] right what is a leader
[54:08] is a husband a leader or a boss
[54:12] we want to be the one who can actually
[54:14] help
[54:15] encourage
[54:16] pick up a broom do some dishes throw in
[54:20] a load of laundry you know maybe you'll
[54:22] say brother Barry you're crazy this is a
[54:24] message Church what are you talking that
[54:25] way for brother Bradham says she's your
[54:28] sweetheart
[54:29] you should treat her that way
[54:31] why would we expect her to be a Slave
[54:34] if we're doing that Brothers I would say
[54:36] just take a step back take a breath
[54:39] because the prophet said try this in
[54:42] your house
[54:46] what does she do all day
[54:49] I want to say this
[54:52] what if she works
[54:54] what if she holds down a job and she's
[54:56] not just a stay-at-home mom you know
[54:58] that's one of the things that this world
[54:59] has done too to say if you're a
[55:01] homemaker you don't do anything do you
[55:04] you have children oh you're a homemaker
[55:06] you're a mom a housewife you don't do
[55:09] anything you haven't accomplished
[55:10] anything you're a nobody
[55:12] that's a lie of the devil you have the
[55:14] hardest job that there is you have the
[55:17] most difficult job the job that's the
[55:19] most rewarding job that there is to be
[55:22] able to take children and raise them up
[55:24] in the fear and the admonition of the
[55:25] Lord Brother Branham says that the wife
[55:27] in the house is the pastor
[55:30] she's the one that gets to raise the
[55:32] children she's the one that gets to
[55:34] teach the children
[55:36] well Daddy's out
[55:38] but for Daddy to treat her like a slave
[55:40] on top of that is is terrible
[55:43] brother Bradham says try this in your
[55:45] own home when Divine love is projected
[55:47] Sovereign Grace comes on the scene
[55:49] brothers and sisters
[55:51] that's the message that he's taken it
[55:52] out of there
[55:54] that I took it out of
[55:56] so if you've got a wife if we've got a
[55:57] wife that's working how much more are we
[55:59] to be digging in and helping
[56:01] if she's not home all day
[56:03] my my
[56:06] remember the quote says right at the
[56:08] very beginning of what I read tonight
[56:09] and try this at your home
[56:12] try and help out
[56:14] see what happens
[56:16] the Branham goes on to say and I said
[56:17] honey you know what I saw the prettiest
[56:20] dress the other day
[56:21] I just so wanted to get it for you
[56:24] and it was in a certain city just here
[56:26] close and we'll go get it and I want to
[56:29] say this this is a prophet he's not just
[56:31] coming out of thin air saying you know I
[56:33] I just want to try and distract her and
[56:35] say you know suddenly I saw this dress
[56:37] he saw the dress
[56:39] and he wanted to get it for her
[56:43] and all the time in my heart praying
[56:44] Heavenly Father quiet this dear
[56:47] quietness dear little woman and I put my
[56:50] hand on her not knowing
[56:52] her not knowing what I was doing
[56:55] I'd say yes honey oh it was beautiful oh
[56:58] Lord quiet this little woman
[57:01] and just kept on you know her not
[57:04] knowing what was I doing
[57:06] was projecting creating a different
[57:08] atmosphere
[57:10] walk in the love of God have Fellowship
[57:14] now some might say brother Barry now
[57:16] you're just going to tell my husband to
[57:18] go and do this and and change the
[57:19] atmosphere you know what it's his job
[57:23] if the things are out of control and
[57:25] things are upset in the home who's going
[57:27] to do it
[57:28] it's the husband's job that's what I'm
[57:30] talking about brothers being in our
[57:31] position that's the devil getting in the
[57:34] family mixing it up who's going to be
[57:36] the one to actually put out the fire
[57:40] and in a few moments she got quiet
[57:43] and then when she got quiet Sarah and
[57:45] Becky divided up all the play blocks
[57:47] Joseph got him something to play with
[57:50] and there was peace in the home
[57:53] Brother Brad I'm here he says what was
[57:56] it
[57:56] projecting love
[58:00] imagine if he just came in and said this
[58:02] is absolutely terrible you're out of
[58:04] your position wife get my food why
[58:06] aren't the kids fed why is the house
[58:08] dirty why aren't the dishes done on and
[58:10] on and on can you imagine what kind of a
[58:12] house that would be to live in
[58:15] terrible
[58:17] what was it projecting love whether
[58:19] Branham said he says they were mine
[58:23] they were mined my children
[58:27] my wife
[58:30] and I was God
[58:33] this is Brother Brown I'm saying this
[58:36] my children my wife and I was God you
[58:42] know Brothers
[58:43] you are Redemption for your family
[58:46] and without you there's no Redemption
[58:48] for your family
[58:50] that's the way it works
[58:52] what was it projecting love they were
[58:55] mine my children my wife and I was God
[58:57] and then God giving his spirit and
[59:01] through that spirit with love to my
[59:04] family
[59:05] Sovereign Grace come in and quieten the
[59:09] family down
[59:10] he says it'll do it I know it will
[59:13] remember he said at the beginning of
[59:14] this quote try it in your home
[59:17] it's not something that he's just saying
[59:18] I tried it and it worked well for me
[59:20] have a nice day
[59:23] help out Brothers
[59:25] help out children it's not just mom's
[59:28] job to slave for everybody
[59:32] you know what caused this situation
[59:36] what brought the peace in the home was
[59:39] the father
[59:40] recognizing that he had the opportunity
[59:42] to change it he had the opportunity to
[59:45] bring Redemption to the situation and
[59:48] you know I said it a minute ago but I'll
[59:50] say it this way he had the opportunity
[59:52] in that moment to either bring
[59:54] Redemption to the situation or wrath to
[59:57] the situation
[59:59] one or the other is going to happen
[1:00:01] every single time we have a situation
[1:00:03] brothers and you know what as sons of
[1:00:06] God what do we have to get upset about
[1:00:07] what is there in this world to get upset
[1:00:10] about really
[1:00:12] what's our greatest possession Brothers
[1:00:16] what's the greatest possession that we
[1:00:18] have here on Earth I will say it it's
[1:00:20] our family
[1:00:21] it's the family that God's given us
[1:00:23] because everything else in this world is
[1:00:25] going to perish outside of the word of
[1:00:27] God
[1:00:28] our family is the most precious gift
[1:00:30] that God has given us remember he has
[1:00:33] given us children on loan
[1:00:35] our children aren't our own
[1:00:37] their sons and daughters of God that
[1:00:39] he's given us to actually raise the
[1:00:41] right way
[1:00:42] and it's not up to us to actually
[1:00:45] project wrath to those children remember
[1:00:47] Billy Paul was going to spank his child
[1:00:49] he's going to spank him so hard the
[1:00:51] prophet said stop
[1:00:52] you're actually going to actually upset
[1:00:55] that boy's angel don't do it
[1:00:58] you know I I'm guilty of that
[1:01:00] times in my life where I know that I've
[1:01:02] projected a little bit too much Wrath
[1:01:05] and you know why I'll say this brothers
[1:01:07] and it's sad but it's true it's because
[1:01:10] I was out of my position and you know
[1:01:12] what happens when we're out of our
[1:01:13] position then we try and point the
[1:01:15] finger
[1:01:16] that's the way it works is what Satan
[1:01:18] does and you know when we've got things
[1:01:20] going on in our lives we talked about it
[1:01:21] on Saturday what a powerful meeting that
[1:01:23] was on Saturday for those who didn't
[1:01:25] make it hopefully we can make it to the
[1:01:28] next one but what a tremendous thing it
[1:01:30] is to recognize we're all the same
[1:01:33] there's nobody here different nobody is
[1:01:35] exclusive we're all fighting the same
[1:01:37] enemy and in the same ways it's not
[1:01:40] something that we can we can pretend
[1:01:42] that it's not happening but you know
[1:01:43] what happens is when we get secret sin
[1:01:46] in our lives I don't know why I
[1:01:47] apologize we get little things going on
[1:01:49] in our lives little secrets going on and
[1:01:52] we know that it's sinful Secrets what
[1:01:54] happens just the human nature it's the
[1:01:56] way the devil Works in our lives we'll
[1:01:58] try and project the the blame on someone
[1:02:00] else we'll put it off on someone else
[1:02:02] and usually unfortunately it winds up
[1:02:04] being our wives
[1:02:05] but we'll wind up putting it off on
[1:02:07] something else something else and really
[1:02:09] it's ourselves and if we can get
[1:02:11] ourselves out of the way we could see
[1:02:13] great success in our lives tremendous
[1:02:15] success in our families
[1:02:18] but I want to say this tonight all of us
[1:02:20] husbands and wives and children what
[1:02:23] kind of atmosphere do we project
[1:02:26] what kind of an atmosphere are we
[1:02:28] setting are we setting an atmosphere of
[1:02:30] Love Are we projecting Divine love
[1:02:33] recognizing the Divine love that our
[1:02:35] father has given us especially for
[1:02:37] husbands boy oh boy it can be easy to to
[1:02:40] point the finger and and say that we
[1:02:42] need to be in our positions and and I'm
[1:02:44] the leader and I need to be served but
[1:02:47] what has God done for us
[1:02:49] the grace that he has bestowed upon us
[1:02:52] is is beyond compare we can't even put
[1:02:54] words to it
[1:02:56] but remember the husbands are supposed
[1:02:58] to love their wives just like Christ
[1:02:59] loved the church right he gave his life
[1:03:02] for the church
[1:03:04] we come in from a day of work and we're
[1:03:06] tired and we're hungry and things are
[1:03:08] out of order and upset and going crazy
[1:03:11] how tired was Jesus when he carried that
[1:03:13] cross to Calvary
[1:03:16] the atmosphere brothers and sisters out
[1:03:19] of love in 1957
[1:03:22] but the Branham says last summer a man
[1:03:24] was stung on a lip by a honeybee that
[1:03:26] broke up some kind of a blood Affair
[1:03:27] died before the doctor could get there
[1:03:30] Hornet will knock you flat on the ground
[1:03:33] when he stings you
[1:03:36] and hear a whole Hive of them over me
[1:03:41] but now instead of being afraid
[1:03:44] I don't know
[1:03:45] what you're going to think of me after
[1:03:47] this
[1:03:49] he says it doesn't matter because I'm
[1:03:51] telling you the truth
[1:03:52] you'll have to answer to God about what
[1:03:55] you think about it
[1:03:58] I hit them Hornets all around me
[1:04:01] and instead of wanting to fight them
[1:04:03] something happened
[1:04:06] I wasn't afraid of them
[1:04:09] what a tremendous thought
[1:04:11] you know what causes that brothers and
[1:04:13] sisters it's not just a supernatural
[1:04:15] thing for a supernatural man in a
[1:04:17] supernatural office
[1:04:19] it's for the supernatural class of
[1:04:21] people
[1:04:22] the prophetic ones
[1:04:24] the ones that just won't be deceived in
[1:04:27] the last day
[1:04:28] they have the ability to have this kind
[1:04:31] of power because it's not their power
[1:04:34] it's his power the only way that we're
[1:04:36] going to get this is to be in our
[1:04:37] position the only way we're going to see
[1:04:39] this success in our lives is to actually
[1:04:41] have a prayer life is to actually be in
[1:04:44] the word to be a part of a body to be in
[1:04:47] service the only way this is going to
[1:04:49] happen in our lives
[1:04:52] he says you've seen all them Hornets all
[1:04:54] around me and instead of wanting to
[1:04:55] fight them something happened I wasn't
[1:04:57] afraid of them I love them
[1:05:01] I thought little creatures of God
[1:05:03] stinging is the only way you got to
[1:05:06] protect yourself
[1:05:08] that's your god-given weapon and I
[1:05:10] Disturbed you out of your house
[1:05:12] I said now I've got to pray for God's
[1:05:14] sick children
[1:05:15] I'm the servant of the Lord
[1:05:18] now in the name of our creator Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ go back into your nest I'll not
[1:05:23] bother you no more
[1:05:25] he says and when I meet you at the
[1:05:27] Judgment bar
[1:05:28] them Hornets Whirled around me and took
[1:05:31] a circle
[1:05:33] I think how he says this and made a
[1:05:34] beeline
[1:05:36] and everyone went right back into their
[1:05:38] nest
[1:05:40] why
[1:05:41] the atmosphere had changed
[1:05:45] you might say brother Barry why are you
[1:05:46] saying this because we're talking about
[1:05:48] families I just want to say it this way
[1:05:50] you could take the example that brother
[1:05:51] Branham gave of his family
[1:05:53] maybe this Hornet's Hive is in your home
[1:05:57] and the Hornets are Little Devils and
[1:05:59] they're just going crazy in your home
[1:06:01] you have the ability brothers and
[1:06:03] sisters tonight to actually project love
[1:06:05] to the situation what's going to send
[1:06:08] those little Hornets back to their hive
[1:06:10] is love
[1:06:11] you can get out this water but you're
[1:06:13] probably going to get stung and it's
[1:06:15] just like that if you want to get into
[1:06:16] it with your wife and really hammer and
[1:06:18] argue and get into it and and say you're
[1:06:21] right and wrong and the other you're not
[1:06:23] going to get anywhere you're going to
[1:06:24] get stung
[1:06:25] it's just going to turn into a problem
[1:06:27] that you can avoid if you can
[1:06:29] projectifying love though because you're
[1:06:31] in your position you're going to see
[1:06:33] success
[1:06:35] but what's our greatest possession
[1:06:36] brothers and sisters I'm gonna just keep
[1:06:38] saying this like this I really want to
[1:06:41] try and encourage us
[1:06:42] Brothers tonight we have the opportunity
[1:06:45] to have leadership in our homes that
[1:06:48] this world has no idea about the whole
[1:06:51] entire world is trying to destroy the
[1:06:54] the concept of marriage the whole idea
[1:06:57] of marriage they're trying to pervert it
[1:06:59] that's what Satan's desire is you know I
[1:07:02] I heard a thing I saw a thing everyone's
[1:07:05] probably seen it how they're trying to
[1:07:06] change the law in the states how the the
[1:07:09] Mormon church now has agreed to say or
[1:07:11] maybe it's a Jehovah's Witnesses one of
[1:07:13] those two has agreed to say they're
[1:07:14] going to accept the same sex theory in
[1:07:17] their Church they're going to pass a
[1:07:19] bill in the U.S saying the same-sex
[1:07:21] marriage is going to stand all of these
[1:07:24] things are happening you know I just had
[1:07:26] a thought this week I couldn't help but
[1:07:27] wonder if maybe back in the days of lot
[1:07:30] you know it says in the Bible that as it
[1:07:32] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[1:07:34] at the coming of the Lord I've always
[1:07:35] thought that it's just going to be you
[1:07:37] know maybe the the the the men in the
[1:07:40] street and and rioting but you know what
[1:07:42] they're doing is they're rioting in the
[1:07:44] street not necessarily for the Angels
[1:07:46] they're rioting over the definition of
[1:07:49] what marriage really is
[1:07:51] n't it interesting to think that the
[1:07:53] same way that it was in the days of
[1:07:55] Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:07:57] the son of man here we are the coming of
[1:07:59] the son of man we can recognize the day
[1:08:00] and the hour which we live in
[1:08:02] and they're doing that they're changing
[1:08:04] the definition of marriage and you know
[1:08:07] we're going to actually be raked over
[1:08:09] the coals for that I can see it loud and
[1:08:11] clear that's going to be where we have a
[1:08:14] problem in our lives as Believers of
[1:08:16] this word when we stand upon true
[1:08:18] marriage between one man and one woman
[1:08:20] and not two men or two women or whatever
[1:08:24] the personalities might be at the moment
[1:08:26] when we get into that sort of thing
[1:08:29] there's no escaping it they've already
[1:08:31] called it deemed it to be a hate crime
[1:08:33] to say anything against it so
[1:08:36] theoretically even what I'm saying is
[1:08:39] skating the line where I could be in
[1:08:41] trouble for that but you know we're
[1:08:42] going to talk about the word of God the
[1:08:43] way that he's given it to us and they're
[1:08:45] going to have to change the constitution
[1:08:46] of Canada to get us to shut up about it
[1:08:49] maybe they'll close the building maybe
[1:08:50] that will start to lose different things
[1:08:52] but they're going to have to take the
[1:08:53] Bibles away from us and say that we're
[1:08:55] not allowed to preach this word
[1:08:57] we have the ability to be different than
[1:08:59] the rest of the world we have the
[1:09:01] ability to be the leaders in our homes
[1:09:03] and we're not talking about the
[1:09:05] self-help gurus we're talking about
[1:09:07] applying the word of God according to
[1:09:09] the message of the hour in our homes
[1:09:11] understanding that that really is what
[1:09:14] it is you know in First Corinthians 11
[1:09:15] Paul says be ye followers of me even as
[1:09:18] I also am of Christ and I would say as
[1:09:22] leaders in our homes brothers that needs
[1:09:24] to be our Keystone scripture if we're
[1:09:26] not doing that if we're not following
[1:09:28] Christ in our homes our wives ain't
[1:09:31] going to respect us they're not going to
[1:09:32] follow us they're going to say I know
[1:09:34] that you say one thing when you go to
[1:09:36] church and one thing when you go home
[1:09:39] and you behave another way
[1:09:41] we have to have the congruent message
[1:09:43] we're going to fool a lot of people in
[1:09:45] our lives if we set out to do that but
[1:09:46] we won't fool our children we won't fool
[1:09:48] our wives
[1:09:49] be followers of me even as I also am of
[1:09:53] Christ how did Paul follow Christ to the
[1:09:56] death
[1:09:58] he was willing to give his life for it
[1:09:59] he knew that he ran the race that he
[1:10:02] finished the course he knew that he did
[1:10:04] everything that he needed to do he was
[1:10:05] the messenger for the age
[1:10:08] but are we following Christ as Paul
[1:10:10] followed Christ I say Lord help me
[1:10:14] how are we going to get our wives to
[1:10:16] follow us Brothers how is that
[1:10:19] leadership going to manifest in our home
[1:10:21] it's going to manifest
[1:10:23] through Trust
[1:10:24] our wives have to trust us our wives
[1:10:26] have to trust that we are actually
[1:10:28] following Christ
[1:10:30] and that we're not leading a double
[1:10:32] standard that we're not one way one time
[1:10:34] and one way another time when that
[1:10:36] happens and it's not a congruent message
[1:10:37] our wives are going to not really
[1:10:39] believe us that we're serving Christ
[1:10:42] it will become very difficult but you
[1:10:44] know for the people who aren't married
[1:10:46] if you're wondering about finding a wife
[1:10:48] or you're wondering about finding a
[1:10:49] husband
[1:10:50] people will follow the leadership that
[1:10:52] they trust and a Christian woman is
[1:10:56] looking for a man who follows Christ she
[1:10:59] is looking for a man who is going to be
[1:11:01] a leader she knows that a man who
[1:11:03] follows Christ will be a strong leader
[1:11:05] in his family in his home and and a
[1:11:09] husband is looking for a wife who is the
[1:11:12] same way who is actually
[1:11:14] willing to be led
[1:11:17] and that's just an interesting topic
[1:11:18] right there because we are the wives of
[1:11:20] Christ and we talked about it if we're
[1:11:22] going to have communion we've got to be
[1:11:24] willing to be led
[1:11:25] but some folks just won't be led they
[1:11:27] refuse to but that's okay
[1:11:30] you know it was the man in the Garden of
[1:11:33] Eden that wasn't deceived it was the
[1:11:34] woman that was out of our position in
[1:11:36] Christ in 1960 do you know ladies that
[1:11:39] it's wrong to wear slacks do you know
[1:11:40] that do you know that it's wrong to cut
[1:11:42] the locks of your hair off do you know
[1:11:43] no do do you know it's wrong mister for
[1:11:48] you to continue to smoke and act the way
[1:11:51] you do
[1:11:52] do you know it's wrong for you to not be
[1:11:54] the husband of your house
[1:11:57] your wife get a little temper spell and
[1:11:59] kick you out the door and you say bless
[1:12:01] your heart honey I'll come right back do
[1:12:03] you know
[1:12:05] how can you be a tender at the house of
[1:12:09] God when you can't even control your own
[1:12:11] house
[1:12:13] that's exactly right
[1:12:15] do you know a sister that your husband
[1:12:16] is not only your husband
[1:12:19] but he is your ruler God said so
[1:12:23] because that was the husband was not
[1:12:26] deceived the woman was deceived
[1:12:30] and you know we can get into this
[1:12:31] discussion here and and say that the
[1:12:33] woman is the weaker vessel and she needs
[1:12:35] to be led that way and we're not going
[1:12:37] there tonight but you know it's a
[1:12:39] spiritual weakness there is a physical
[1:12:41] weakness being a weaker vessel
[1:12:42] physically weaker sometimes females can
[1:12:47] be physically stronger it's just the way
[1:12:49] God created us but physically typically
[1:12:52] the female is weaker the woman is weaker
[1:12:54] but spiritually speaking it was the
[1:12:56] woman that was deceived and that's what
[1:12:57] the word is talking about so to say that
[1:12:59] a woman mentally is weaker is not a
[1:13:03] correct statement it's not I don't
[1:13:04] believe that's right entirely nope
[1:13:07] it's a spiritual thing more than
[1:13:09] anything
[1:13:10] she's weaker and brothers it's important
[1:13:13] for us to make sure that we're in our
[1:13:14] spiritual position for the weaker vessel
[1:13:17] it's not about saying that you need to
[1:13:19] actually just follow my rulership my
[1:13:22] dictatorship if that's what we're doing
[1:13:24] it's not according to the word it's not
[1:13:26] going to turn out right
[1:13:28] we'll get resentment that way
[1:13:30] like we said before Redemption it comes
[1:13:31] to the man
[1:13:33] the blood
[1:13:34] the bloodline comes through the mail we
[1:13:37] know that
[1:13:39] and it's interesting that the family
[1:13:41] doesn't take the female's name
[1:13:43] takes the male's name
[1:13:45] is that right
[1:13:47] it's a reason there's a reason for that
[1:13:50] because the husband's answer to God
[1:13:52] the husbands are the ones that will
[1:13:53] answer for their families for their
[1:13:55] wives for their own actions
[1:13:58] out of a life story brother Branham says
[1:14:00] enduring this time her mother and father
[1:14:03] had separated and I said we we went to
[1:14:06] tell her mother and I said Mrs bromback
[1:14:08] I said I found that wonderful people
[1:14:10] like that and she was sitting on the
[1:14:12] porch you know now don't get mad at me
[1:14:14] if you're here so she said she was
[1:14:17] sitting on the porch Fanning she said
[1:14:19] William I'll give you to understand I
[1:14:21] will never give my daughter permission
[1:14:22] to go out with a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:14:24] like that oh my she said that bunch of
[1:14:27] trash said she'd never had a decent
[1:14:29] dress to put on her back I said well Mrs
[1:14:31] bromback it is an address proposition I
[1:14:34] said the thing of it is is that I feel
[1:14:36] that God wants me to do it
[1:14:39] remember this is his wife he's talking
[1:14:41] about
[1:14:42] she's saying her daughter but she didn't
[1:14:44] actually give her daughter away there
[1:14:46] and she said look why don't you go up
[1:14:48] there at the church where you've got a
[1:14:51] congregation coming and think about
[1:14:52] getting yourself a parsonage and and
[1:14:54] place to take your wife and baby too
[1:14:56] instead of pulling her out today she's
[1:14:58] got something to eat and tomorrow she's
[1:15:00] got nothing and things like this she
[1:15:02] said never indeed will I ever permit my
[1:15:04] daughter to go out like that and if she
[1:15:06] does go her mother will go to a grave
[1:15:08] brokenhearted and hope said Mama do you
[1:15:10] mean that and she said that's just what
[1:15:12] I mean that settled it
[1:15:14] hope started crying I put my arm around
[1:15:16] her and walked away I said but Mrs
[1:15:18] bromback she's my wife
[1:15:20] she said but she's my daughter
[1:15:23] said yes ma'am
[1:15:25] I walked away and went down and she
[1:15:27] looked at me hopeded she said bill
[1:15:29] that's my mother but I will go with you
[1:15:32] see I said God bless your heart she said
[1:15:34] I will go with you and she said honey I
[1:15:36] guess I'm carrying water on both
[1:15:38] shoulders I said I don't want to hurt
[1:15:41] her feelings she said what if something
[1:15:44] would happen to her and then you'd be
[1:15:46] worried all about all your life you
[1:15:49] broke your mother's heart I said maybe
[1:15:51] we'll just put it off for a little while
[1:15:53] and Friends there's where I made the
[1:15:55] worst step I ever made in my life right
[1:15:57] there
[1:15:59] we put it off a few weeks later things
[1:16:01] began to happen the flood
[1:16:03] on later from that the first thing you
[1:16:04] know wife got sick Billy got sick
[1:16:07] brother Branham is painting this picture
[1:16:09] showing that he was the man the husband
[1:16:12] of the home the leader of his wife and
[1:16:15] he allowed somebody to get in the midst
[1:16:17] of that
[1:16:18] we had talked about that in the past
[1:16:20] there can't be three people in a
[1:16:22] marriage there can only be two
[1:16:24] two people a husband and a wife and the
[1:16:27] husband has to be the leader that's the
[1:16:29] way God has instigated it from the
[1:16:31] Garden of Eden we know that that's the
[1:16:33] scripture God said that the man will
[1:16:36] rule over you after the curse after the
[1:16:39] fall when the curse was handed out
[1:16:42] but it's important to just recognize
[1:16:44] that it's solely
[1:16:47] placed on the shoulders of the husbands
[1:16:49] all of it for our whole entire family
[1:16:54] it's a very difficult position to be in
[1:16:56] but God's equipped us for it
[1:16:58] we're not going into this unequipped
[1:17:01] it's just important to recognize the
[1:17:04] gravity of it
[1:17:05] it's up to us to make sure that we're in
[1:17:07] our positions if we want to see success
[1:17:10] because really in the end who was
[1:17:12] accountable to God question and answers
[1:17:14] on Genesis in 1953 brother Bradham says
[1:17:16] now I think that would get that man and
[1:17:20] woman
[1:17:21] now a woman is let me get this in right
[1:17:23] good now he says so that you can see it
[1:17:26] see
[1:17:27] woman is subject to her husband and the
[1:17:30] Bible said that a man should rule over
[1:17:33] his wife
[1:17:36] but how they've changed that the woman
[1:17:38] rules over the man
[1:17:41] now you stay home John you're not going
[1:17:43] and that settles it
[1:17:45] yes my dear
[1:17:47] see but let me tell you something mister
[1:17:50] you are going to have to answer for your
[1:17:52] wife
[1:17:53] but your wife is never going to have to
[1:17:55] answer for you
[1:17:57] you are the head of the home and God is
[1:18:00] the head of the man
[1:18:02] and brothers when we look at that quote
[1:18:05] there I'm not saying it in such a way
[1:18:06] that we need to get the iron fist out
[1:18:08] I'll never say get the iron fist out
[1:18:10] I will say stand on the word of God
[1:18:12] present the word of God live the word of
[1:18:15] God so completely before your families
[1:18:18] that your wives will respect you that
[1:18:21] your wives will follow your leadership
[1:18:23] according to the word because if she is
[1:18:25] a Godly wife which she better be if you
[1:18:28] married her she may have the holy ghost
[1:18:31] in her life she better have it
[1:18:33] she will follow your leadership when
[1:18:37] you're in your position it's not
[1:18:39] something that's optional she will if
[1:18:41] she's a believer
[1:18:42] but that's where one of the greatest
[1:18:44] mistakes can happen in the life of a
[1:18:45] human being is to actually be a believer
[1:18:47] and marry someone and think they'll
[1:18:49] become a Believer if you think they'll
[1:18:51] become a Believer that's a mighty big
[1:18:53] risk you're taking
[1:18:55] there's no promises
[1:18:58] husbands have to answer for their wives
[1:19:00] not the other way around husbands will
[1:19:02] give account for their wives
[1:19:04] wives will not have to answer for their
[1:19:07] husbands
[1:19:09] and there can only be one leader in the
[1:19:11] home and in the family
[1:19:12] and the way that Harmony will come
[1:19:15] I'm just going to say it again is by
[1:19:17] projecting
[1:19:18] love
[1:19:20] by bringing love to the situation not an
[1:19:23] iron fist not demanding if we're
[1:19:26] demanding brothers and sisters anything
[1:19:27] but the word of God we're actually
[1:19:29] missing the mark
[1:19:31] we can actually
[1:19:33] I would say this we can actually be
[1:19:35] abusive
[1:19:36] we can take the word of God and make it
[1:19:39] a leverage against our wife or against
[1:19:41] our children and that is going to be
[1:19:43] something we'll answer for before God
[1:19:46] because Proverbs 15 1.
[1:19:49] says a soft answer turneth away Wrath
[1:19:54] but Grievous words stir up anger and if
[1:19:57] you go on further he talks about how
[1:19:59] someone who is really quick with their
[1:20:01] mouth
[1:20:02] they just get angry and burst out and
[1:20:05] have all that
[1:20:06] you can read it it's in Proverbs 15.
[1:20:09] it's not good
[1:20:11] we want to make sure that we're in our
[1:20:13] positions and that we're actually
[1:20:14] willing to offer a soft answer that
[1:20:17] we're willing to turn away Wrath
[1:20:19] that we're not going to get angry how
[1:20:21] often does God get angry with us
[1:20:23] how often does God give us the iron fist
[1:20:26] how often does God demand us as husbands
[1:20:30] anything but his word
[1:20:33] never
[1:20:35] he's a gentleman
[1:20:37] he always speaks softly to us it's
[1:20:39] always that still Small Voice it's
[1:20:41] always that that that that that love
[1:20:43] that we feel from him
[1:20:45] how could we offer anything but that to
[1:20:48] our family especially our wives that
[1:20:50] other half that one that was taken from
[1:20:52] our side our little sweetheart brother
[1:20:54] Branham says
[1:20:56] but you know the women they're not off
[1:20:58] the hook the sisters aren't off the hook
[1:20:59] I'm being pretty hard on the men tonight
[1:21:02] speaking about the leadership role and
[1:21:04] the importance of what it means to be a
[1:21:06] leader but remember sisters brother
[1:21:08] Branham and Look Away to Jesus 1963
[1:21:11] she's always set my clothes to the
[1:21:12] cleaners talking about his wife here
[1:21:14] it's always sent my clothes to the
[1:21:15] cleaners and washed my shirts and had
[1:21:17] everything ready to go into the meeting
[1:21:19] and then she wonders how she can serve
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:22] he says you woman as you serve your
[1:21:25] husband you serve God of course
[1:21:29] and that is something that's in the
[1:21:31] desire of a woman that's something
[1:21:32] that's in the heart of a person to want
[1:21:35] to serve another we know that eternal
[1:21:37] life is living for others but we could
[1:21:39] say it this way eternal life is serving
[1:21:41] others
[1:21:42] eternal life is helping other people
[1:21:44] but Brother Brad I'm speaking
[1:21:45] specifically to the sisters to the wives
[1:21:47] as you serve your husband you serve God
[1:21:51] Annette you know he's looking at it from
[1:21:53] the perspective also that the wife is at
[1:21:55] home
[1:21:56] he spoke really strongly about sisters
[1:21:58] being out working out in the workforce
[1:22:01] he was quite strong about that and
[1:22:03] sometimes it needed to happen he said it
[1:22:05] sometimes the wives needed to work to
[1:22:07] actually make ends meet
[1:22:09] but other than that he was very strong
[1:22:11] about the women working not working
[1:22:14] staying at home to raise their children
[1:22:16] otherwise somebody else winds up raising
[1:22:18] your children
[1:22:19] it's not an easy thing
[1:22:21] I'm not saying one way or the other I
[1:22:23] say get the Holy Ghost in your life get
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost and let him lead you you
[1:22:28] know it's like brother Branham says you
[1:22:29] know if you want to be healed why do you
[1:22:31] want to be healed
[1:22:33] what's your motive for being healed
[1:22:36] if it's just so you can go and travel
[1:22:38] the seven seas and see all the different
[1:22:40] countries in the world and and go and do
[1:22:43] all the things that you could do worldly
[1:22:44] speaking is that really the right reason
[1:22:47] or is it because you you have a position
[1:22:50] in your church or you want to serve your
[1:22:53] family or you have a purpose according
[1:22:55] to God's word what's your motive for
[1:22:57] getting healed that will dictate the
[1:23:00] outcome of your prayers when you ask for
[1:23:02] something for God
[1:23:04] and the same thing for our our husbands
[1:23:06] and our wives if we're going to actually
[1:23:08] pray for something in our family what's
[1:23:11] the motive what's the objective for it
[1:23:13] why do we want to have extra work why do
[1:23:16] we want to have extra income what's the
[1:23:18] motive and objective for that
[1:23:20] get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] he'll help you
[1:23:24] but the husband is the leader out of you
[1:23:25] must be born again and you woman that
[1:23:27] take another man in your arm you've
[1:23:29] marred that mold you were taken from
[1:23:30] remember that when you act like a man
[1:23:33] you're out of your place
[1:23:36] and when a man begins to get too
[1:23:38] and babying and this and that and the
[1:23:41] other he's out of his place he's the
[1:23:43] boss he's the ruler
[1:23:46] now I don't mean a floor mat
[1:23:49] I just said a ruler
[1:23:51] helpmate
[1:23:53] not to kick a woman around
[1:23:55] they're not but the Bible said God said
[1:23:57] in the creation you shall rule over you
[1:24:00] not be a boss but to be a help mate part
[1:24:04] of you
[1:24:06] Brother Brad I'm saying this here he
[1:24:08] says she's sweet and kind talking about
[1:24:10] our wives or potential future wives
[1:24:14] she's sweet and kind and tender you
[1:24:17] should lead her around sweetly
[1:24:21] because she's a part of you
[1:24:25] you go to mistreating her
[1:24:27] then you're mistreating yourself
[1:24:30] and a man mentally right won't do that
[1:24:33] we talked a little bit about it on
[1:24:35] Sunday
[1:24:36] the man the maniac from Galleria of the
[1:24:40] gadarians he lived in the cave
[1:24:42] he was naked and he ran around the Bible
[1:24:45] says that he cut himself
[1:24:48] harmed himself wasn't afraid to break
[1:24:51] the Fetters that they put on on the
[1:24:53] chains he was possessed with the devil
[1:24:54] and we know that many people know that
[1:24:56] story as Legion
[1:24:57] he had a lot of devils in him but an
[1:25:00] example of it a man doesn't mistreat
[1:25:02] himself who is in his right mind and
[1:25:05] that's an example of a man mistreating
[1:25:06] himself but I want to say what's the
[1:25:09] difference
[1:25:10] if we're cutting our wives how do we cut
[1:25:13] our wives Brothers with our words
[1:25:16] we can really cause a lot of harm with
[1:25:18] words
[1:25:20] we need to make sure that we're not
[1:25:21] mistreating her brother Branham says
[1:25:24] then you're just mistreating yourself
[1:25:25] and a man mentally right won't do that
[1:25:29] we know in Genesis 2 15 and the Lord
[1:25:32] took the man and put him in the Garden
[1:25:34] of Eden to dress it and to keep it and
[1:25:36] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[1:25:38] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[1:25:39] deed freely
[1:25:41] but the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:25:42] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[1:25:45] for the day that thou edest thereof Thou
[1:25:49] shalt surely die
[1:25:51] why are you saying that brother Barry
[1:25:52] I'm saying it because God never told the
[1:25:54] woman that
[1:25:56] that's the point he told the man that
[1:25:58] but the woman was a part of the man so
[1:26:01] she heard that and even if she didn't
[1:26:04] have ears to hear while she was yet in
[1:26:06] him as the spirit or even in his flesh
[1:26:09] he was the one that had to make sure
[1:26:12] honey don't do that don't do that he's
[1:26:15] instructed us to never ever do that go
[1:26:20] and eat from that tree
[1:26:22] he didn't tell Eve that he told Adam
[1:26:26] God instructed the man the husband's
[1:26:28] responsibility is to be accountable to
[1:26:30] God
[1:26:31] according
[1:26:33] to the same word of God
[1:26:35] husband is to love his wife
[1:26:38] and to not be bitter against her we
[1:26:41] didn't even get into the scriptures that
[1:26:42] I wanted to read tonight
[1:26:43] we probably could that's out of Peter I
[1:26:46] believe it is
[1:26:47] the word says to love your wives
[1:26:49] husbands and not be bitter against them
[1:26:52] sometimes things can happen in our lives
[1:26:55] and we can start to develop feelings and
[1:26:59] you know we hear about it we've talked
[1:27:00] about it extensively in terms of a
[1:27:03] brother in the church brother to brother
[1:27:05] you know what if we have ought against
[1:27:07] another
[1:27:08] we ought to go to that brother right and
[1:27:11] actually deal with it according to the
[1:27:13] word of God and not let the devil get in
[1:27:15] but what about our wives and our
[1:27:17] relationship sometimes we can go down
[1:27:19] the road a long ways into our marriages
[1:27:21] through many different situations many
[1:27:24] dangers toils and snares
[1:27:26] and learn to not communicate
[1:27:30] and you know I'll just say it this way
[1:27:31] I'm I'm not afraid I don't think anybody
[1:27:34] has the the issue here but the the
[1:27:37] person that I was talking about in a
[1:27:39] prayer earlier tonight he's just
[1:27:41] separated in his relationship his wife
[1:27:43] has taken the kids and probably he'll
[1:27:45] never receive his family back they're
[1:27:48] gone
[1:27:49] and he's desperate he's in despair it's
[1:27:52] terrible
[1:27:55] but it's our responsibility Brothers to
[1:27:57] make sure that doesn't happen
[1:27:59] we can easily just point the finger and
[1:28:01] say it's the wife's but it's not it's
[1:28:03] ours
[1:28:05] because we're supposed to love our wives
[1:28:07] just like Christ loved the church
[1:28:08] willing to give his life for it
[1:28:12] but we can get so caught up in our lives
[1:28:14] that we forget to just take some time
[1:28:16] and Treat Her Like She's our sweetheart
[1:28:21] but you know
[1:28:22] the husband's responsibility is to be
[1:28:24] accountable to God for his family
[1:28:28] sometimes in our lives brother Branham
[1:28:30] says that I don't have the quote for it
[1:28:32] but every single human goes through
[1:28:35] stages
[1:28:36] sometimes our wives go through a stage
[1:28:39] where they change after the manner of a
[1:28:42] woman
[1:28:43] they go through that stage and they have
[1:28:45] a lot of different symptoms and you know
[1:28:48] sometimes husbands can get bitter
[1:28:51] against their wives
[1:28:53] and you know what brother Branham says
[1:28:55] about that when the woman comes to that
[1:28:57] change of life he says that's the time
[1:28:59] Brothers you want to be their friends
[1:29:01] that's the time they need support that's
[1:29:03] the time they need a real close friend
[1:29:05] not when someone can get bitter against
[1:29:07] them it can be so easy to actually get
[1:29:10] that way though if we're not in our
[1:29:12] positions that's why I want to try and
[1:29:14] encourage us Brothers
[1:29:16] let's have prayer meeting let's get
[1:29:19] together and do what we did on Saturday
[1:29:21] and confess our faults one to another so
[1:29:23] that we can pray one for another
[1:29:26] so that we're solid in our relationships
[1:29:29] as brothers so that we're solid shoulder
[1:29:31] to shoulder as soldiers for the cross
[1:29:34] when we know we have a problem maybe in
[1:29:36] our family maybe in our own life
[1:29:38] whatever it is
[1:29:41] the one thing we talked about was trust
[1:29:43] it's so important to be able to trust if
[1:29:44] we can't trust we'll never be able to do
[1:29:47] that but boy when we can trust
[1:29:50] I say Satan look out
[1:29:53] you know Ephesians 6 32
[1:29:55] Paul talks about this being a mystery
[1:29:57] not about a husband and wife though he's
[1:30:00] talking about the husband and wife
[1:30:01] living together what he's talking about
[1:30:02] this great mystery is about Christ and
[1:30:04] his bride Christ and taking his very own
[1:30:07] bride and how much love unconditional he
[1:30:12] has for his bride that he would take the
[1:30:15] prophet for this age you might say
[1:30:17] brother Barry this is such a simple
[1:30:19] thing but I think it's so pertinent
[1:30:21] brothers and sisters try this at home
[1:30:24] try this in your home brother Branham
[1:30:25] said take that quote I'll give it to you
[1:30:27] if you want it brother Branham said try
[1:30:29] it in your home it works
[1:30:32] all we need to do is help out
[1:30:35] we could see a big difference out of a
[1:30:37] thinking man's filter in 1965 brother
[1:30:40] Bradham says oh for the grace of God
[1:30:41] that he'd give us such understanding of
[1:30:44] such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here
[1:30:46] further on down in Ephesians speaking of
[1:30:49] the husband and wife and said this is a
[1:30:51] mystery how the woman should be in
[1:30:53] respect to their husband even the second
[1:30:56] place I believe it is in the entire
[1:30:57] Bible that reverence was ever spoke to
[1:30:59] said the woman seeing that she reverence
[1:31:01] her husband reverence her husband then a
[1:31:04] husband
[1:31:05] ought to live such a life before his
[1:31:08] wife that his wife could reverence him
[1:31:11] as a son of God
[1:31:14] that a husband ought to live such a life
[1:31:17] before his wife
[1:31:20] that his wife could reverence him as a
[1:31:23] son of God
[1:31:26] and if he doesn't live that kind of a
[1:31:28] life
[1:31:29] well then course
[1:31:31] she wouldn't reverence him
[1:31:34] because she knows what he's made of
[1:31:38] but when it is a man that is reverent
[1:31:40] man reverent and clean with his wife
[1:31:44] and before his family a real servant of
[1:31:47] God
[1:31:48] then the woman
[1:31:50] children all should respect that servant
[1:31:53] of God with reverence
[1:31:56] and that will just happen supernaturally
[1:31:58] brothers that will happen supernaturally
[1:32:01] sisters if we have upsets in the homes
[1:32:04] let's just get into our positions
[1:32:07] and March forward together and just see
[1:32:09] what will happen
[1:32:11] all the Mysteries have been revealed if
[1:32:14] we can take the word and and apply it
[1:32:17] and not just apply it to say that I'm
[1:32:19] just going to take it and put it in my
[1:32:21] pocket I'm going to put it in my Bible
[1:32:22] I'm going to write it in my fly leaf I'm
[1:32:25] going to take that word and I'm going to
[1:32:26] eat that word and I'm going to go and
[1:32:28] live that word because I'm a part of
[1:32:30] that word that word's now a part of me
[1:32:32] I'm going to live that word I'm going to
[1:32:36] be a doer of that word not just to hear
[1:32:38] like James 1 but be ye doers of the word
[1:32:42] and not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:32:45] selves
[1:32:47] I want to say it again what kind of an
[1:32:49] atmosphere do we create
[1:32:51] we're all creators
[1:32:53] we've moved beyond the first poll we've
[1:32:57] moved beyond the second Pole now
[1:32:59] brothers and sisters we're in the third
[1:33:01] pole Ministry
[1:33:02] we're on the bride age we've gone past
[1:33:05] the layout to see an age even we're in
[1:33:08] the bride age we're in the spoken word
[1:33:10] Condition what Kind of an atmosphere are
[1:33:13] we creating in our lives
[1:33:16] we have the ability to create we are
[1:33:18] Messiah s we are creators what kind of
[1:33:22] an atmosphere do we create in our home
[1:33:25] well kind of an atmosphere do we create
[1:33:27] in our marriage what kind of an
[1:33:29] atmosphere do we create in our
[1:33:31] relationships with our children
[1:33:33] our children are solely dependent on on
[1:33:36] our relationships with them it's a
[1:33:38] totally separate topic and discussion
[1:33:40] but my goodness if we don't have a
[1:33:43] relationship if they don't feel safe if
[1:33:45] they don't have trust in us to come and
[1:33:46] talk to us about things in their life if
[1:33:48] they think that every time that they're
[1:33:50] going to come and talk to us we're just
[1:33:51] going to hammer down and preach the word
[1:33:53] to them are they going to come and talk
[1:33:54] to us are they going to confide in our
[1:33:56] lives they're not going to want to talk
[1:33:58] to us because they're just going to get
[1:33:59] preached at
[1:34:01] and when that happens what's going to
[1:34:03] happen they're going to find someone
[1:34:04] that will listen
[1:34:07] what kind of an atmosphere are we
[1:34:09] creating brothers and sisters
[1:34:12] I said now we've got to pray for this
[1:34:14] God's sick children
[1:34:16] I'm the servant of the Lord I'll call
[1:34:19] the musicians up I'm going to close here
[1:34:22] brother Branham in in in
[1:34:25] uh when Divine love is projected
[1:34:28] Sovereign Grace takes a hold
[1:34:33] he says I said now I've got to pray for
[1:34:36] God's sick children I'm the servant of
[1:34:38] the Lord
[1:34:39] he had a purpose
[1:34:41] for divine love being projected he had a
[1:34:44] reason for it to be projected
[1:34:49] and I bet that every one of us have a
[1:34:51] reason to project Divine love in our
[1:34:52] lives
[1:34:55] in the name of our creator Jesus Christ
[1:34:58] go back into your nest I'll not bother
[1:35:01] you no more
[1:35:03] and when I meet you at the Judgment bar
[1:35:06] them Hornets Whirled around me took a
[1:35:09] circle and made a beeline and every one
[1:35:11] of them went right back into their nest
[1:35:13] why was that it was because the
[1:35:16] atmosphere had changed
[1:35:18] we have the ability brothers and sisters
[1:35:20] to change the atmosphere
[1:35:22] I don't know about you
[1:35:25] I can give you an example of a time in
[1:35:27] my life where I witnessed
[1:35:30] one of my boys changing the atmosphere
[1:35:33] and I believe it was the Lord living out
[1:35:36] through him
[1:35:38] brother Barry
[1:35:40] living in a condition where he had his
[1:35:43] little secret thing that was just not
[1:35:45] right before the Lord and just was upset
[1:35:47] all the time and always angry decided to
[1:35:51] Iron Fist the situation to make it
[1:35:53] better and what was happening was one of
[1:35:56] the children we're suffering for it
[1:35:58] and one of the other children
[1:36:01] jumped out and I'm talking small child
[1:36:04] four years old or less
[1:36:06] and said Daddy it's not supposed to be
[1:36:08] like this
[1:36:09] and you know what it did it changed the
[1:36:11] atmosphere in my life forever it changed
[1:36:14] my attitude in the situation I believe
[1:36:17] it was God saying you're about to hurt
[1:36:20] that boy's Angel you need to back off
[1:36:25] the atmosphere can change my goodness if
[1:36:28] a four-year-old could change an
[1:36:29] atmosphere what can we do brothers
