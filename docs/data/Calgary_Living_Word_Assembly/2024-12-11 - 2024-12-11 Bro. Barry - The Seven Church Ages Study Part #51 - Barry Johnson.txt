after God bless you amen bless you all I just wanted to share something with you that's been on my heart all day just throughout the day I was thinking about what we've been going through on Wednesday nights and just over and over again I just kept hearing the pastor's voice about never can a Believer or underestimate the power of Revelation by the spirit and such a spirit of Thanksgiving Came Upon me just to to think in a world of total blindness he's given us eyes to see to see Christ in one another to be able to look beyond the Flesh and see the kingdom of God what a [Music] blessing this poem is called Turn it to the right and just think about when he says turn it to the right it's God given you a revelation oh spirit of God so gentle so wise illuminate the truth with thy light from on high for without your presence our hearts remain dim unable to Fathom the plan within him the word written revealed so perfect so pure holds Mysteries deep Eternal and sure but to grasp the vision to see the design we seek your guidance Divine upon Divine the pl turn it to the right the voice word written speaks revealed Illuminating the picture that every heart seeks not with our logic nor wisdom of men but by your spirit we truly are born again each promise each type and Shadow yes each line interweaves in the fabric of Grace that only Faith perceives your spirit unveils and as the veil Falls away behold the plan of the master in bright array for Christ is the center the alpha the start the one who brings light to our eyes and to the heart we see not with by man's efforts nor natural sight but through your spirit who turns it to the right oh let us not falter not stumble in Pride but rest in your leading with you as our guide Show us the picture complete and fulfilled that aligns with the purpose your word has instilled so we yield to you Holy Spirit in reverence and a manifesting the word the Fulfillment of all for the plan of the father once veiled now shines bright

nothing for my journey I was listening to a brother that uh was referring to what brother Braham said somewhere where brother Braham had said that you can never be the word at the end if you were not

thank you musicians once again everyone for your sacred portion thank you for the specials the poem and the song it's just tremendous if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to carry on with our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations chapter 3 we're dealing with the Philadelphian Church age and it's amazing to me because the Philadelphia Church age according to this book is almost finished and then we move on to the leoan church and then we're done I mean we have the resume of the ages one of the best parts of it but you know it it's just amazing to me what I'm getting at is how quickly it's gone by how it seems quick many people are probably groaning saying brother Barry it's over a year can we just get on to something else and maybe that's the case but this has just a been a wonderful study just a wonderful study Revelations chapter 3 verse 7 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set be before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly whoops sorry about that hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time heavenly father thank you for Lord ears to hear what your spirit says thank you for the open door Lord Jesus that you've placed before us knowing Lord that's Revelation that we have father and we can walk through that door and we thank you for it Lord Jesus no man can shut that door or open it because you are the one that placed it before us help us Lord to just step through that door one more time tonight father we love you and we thank you we commit this word into your hand in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just uh couple of announcements before we get going we have the Youth Event on the 15th I believe that's this Sunday and uh December the 22nd we have a special guest speaker and uh we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has placed upon his heart and uh it's awfully quiet I love the suspense brother John panicker is actually gonna take the service our brother's a minister and uh he's kept it under wraps but you don't have to guess very much when you spend some time in fellowship with our brother to know that he knows the word really well and what's even more I think is wonderful is that the word knows him just like every one of us so um he's expressed a desire and uh I could sense it and so I invited him to take a service and uh yeah I trust it'll be a real blessing we've talked a little bit about what the Lord's placed on his heart and I'm just going to leave it at that so pray for Brother John panicker and his family and uh we'll certainly trust the Lord will speak to us we have the communion service coming up on the 31st it's a communion testimony service so it could be a little bit longer we just want to give room for the spirit um if people want to bring specials uh we're more than welcome to do that we don't want to put a rush on things we just want to have a little bit of time uh for our communion and testimony service maybe a few specials some praise whatever um let's just get together and fellowship around the Lord while the rest of the world goes out and parties in a new year and uh parties away their life and celebrates uh false sense of security because we know this world is fit for judgment so the 31st we'll have a community testimony service and there will be no service on January the 1st because the 31st is just before that and I'm sure if things go well we'll wake up hung over but hung over in the spirit that's how preachers feel Monday morning it's uh yeah we're just going to cancel the service on on the first I hope that's okay with everyone and uh that might give us time to go and fellowship after the service if we don't go till midnight we just want to make it as uh easy as possible for everyone to just have a good time so God bless you tonight um remember Cadre Diggs he says hello and uh he has has us on his radar for some time in February so we trust the Lord will open up the door for him to come there's something else that I wanted to mention I've kind of had it on my heart and uh I trust it will be okay as well um if you have any questions about what we've preached what we've talked about out of the exposition of the seven Church ages what I want to do is open up an opportunity for questions and answers on the seven Church ages so if you have questions please by all means write them down put them in the offering put them in the offering when it's handed around put it in an offering box just write your question down on the prayer request sheets or if you have your own sheet put it in the offering box and the deacons will give it to me you can make it Anonymous or not um we don't want to have contentious problems but if you have issues that you just don't understand something that maybe just isn't clear just put it in there and we'll pray about it and we'll actually have a questions and answers service or services on this book I believe there's so much in here personally I believe we should have a series of Services of questions from this book I know there's things in there that I might have a question on and I might actually throw my question into the offering box just for fun just because there's things that I think really um they really worth taking some time to explain so um if you have questions already write them down if not um if it comes up by all means write it down I'm going to take some time it's not going to be a rush uh it'll come up after we finish this book just so we can take some time and study and accurately answer to the best of our ability according to the word and the spirit so God bless you tonight I trust everyone is doing well by God's grace we know we've had some illnesses going around and it's kind of the season for it unfortunately it's not a pleasant thing but um we know we have a Healer certainly tremendous tonight I just want to carry on where we left off I'm going to go back just a little bit from where we left off um in the exposition of the seven Church ages the Philadelphian Church age we got into the age of the open door and I just believe we could preach a series on that the age of the open door and that Open Door brothers and sisters we've been given sunset Mountain a door was open In Heaven There was a revelation John was called a little higher and we know it was through the opening of them Seven Seals when those seven angels met him and told him come up higher now go back and get into your position because there's going to be an open door for a bunch of people to come in for the bride to come in we are in the age of the open door and we know brother bradam is talking about the Philadelphia and church age but he also says every single Church age applies consecutively to Future Church ages so we can take this word and apply it to our very lives I think it's so beautiful where we left off last time um so we can see by the comparison of scriptures that this Open Door signified the greatest spreading of the Gospel that the world has ever seen and it's just a tremendous thought what really happened in the Philadelphian Church age the Bram gets into it a little bit later we'll get there um carrying on though he says I want you to see something here God works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or pergami and age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nicotin had become the doctrine of the nicotin that age was the open door for the false Vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a word system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this Mighty move as that age give us exploration colonization the printing of books Etc it would have been wonderful if this Open Door had followed the Divine pattern of Pentecost which was set forth in Hebrews chapter 2 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every trans transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will now you know that this is the pattern for Jesus himself said so Mark 16:15 to20 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following I think it's beautiful thought here how when we look at this it just really stood out to me how did the Lord work with them they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word he was confirming the word he wasn't confirming the signs and wonders he wasn't confirming the the ministry of the of the hierarchy of the Bishops and the Elders right he confirmed the word and when we can put the word first brothers and sisters that's the critical factor to our existence as Believers of this message when we put the word first that's what he will confirm the signs and wonders will follow they actually have to follow it's not like an option it's not even optional that's the pattern that he set forward I think it's just such a beautiful thing they went forth preaching everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen he never told them to go into all the world and establish Bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now those things are fine but what Jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way the kingdom of God was to be preached was when he sent out the 12 in Matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the twel Apostles are these the first Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother philli and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the Publican James the son of alfus and lius whose na surname was tatus Simon the Canaanite and Judas es scariot were who also betrayed him these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as ye go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely ye have received freely give and we know that they were called to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and Paul was sent to the Gentiles he goes on to say this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own Ministry with them and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multi dudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then saith he to his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest Matthew 9:35 to 38 now many people have the idea that just the apostles had this ministry given to them by our our lord Jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that's not so here in Luke 10 veres 1-9 we find that in the days of his Earthly sojourn he had already started to give ministries of power to his own Luke 10 1-9 after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whether himself would go therefore said he unto them the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth laborers into his Harvest go your ways behold I send you forth as Lambs Among Wolves carry neither purse nor script nor shoes and salute no man by the way and enter whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever City ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you and we know that's Luke 10 veres 1-9 I can't help but that think that scripture is just such a perfect depiction of an evangelist's role to go from City to city and to just spend time with the people carrying on he says who would dare deny the mighty Ministry of Phillip who would dare deny the mighty ministries of arenus Martin Columba Patrick and countless scores of others who have had God's anointing upon them yes the Bible is the real way of the open door and I want to add my testimony to that the reason I have to do that is because I can only speak with assurance concerning what God has done in my own life and isn't it wonderful brothers and sisters because that's exactly the testimony of every one of us as Believers we can talk about what's happened to other people and it's wonderful I've got many experiences I'm sure you do as well we all do about what God's done for other people but people want to hear what's God doing for you when we can talk about it as a firstperson experience that makes all the difference we become living Witnesses I think it's beautiful how he says this I want to add my testimony to that the reason I have to do that is because I can only speak with Assurance concerning what God has done in my own life so if you'll excuse a personal note here I'll tell you how I know for assurity that Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever and that the power of God is still available to those who will believe and receive the apostolic Age Ain't Over he said that I can show you in the Bible where it started now you show me where it ended in the Bible such a beautiful thought he says during my missionary trip to South Africa God so blessed that when I came to Durban the only place that could begin to accommodate the people was the huge racetrack which is in the second largest in the world the crowd was well over 100,000 people what a meeting that would be in order to keep Law and Order they had to put up fences to separate the various tribes they posted hundreds of policemen to keep the throngs quieted down those hungry Souls had come for many miles a queen from rhasia had come with a train of 27 coaches loaded with African natives they struggled in across the fields and mountains bearing on their backs for many and many a mile some loved one that needed help the whole country was stirred by the mighty works that had been manifested by the Holy Spirit isn't that beautiful not by my Ministry not by the ministry simply put by the Holy Spirit one afternoon as I began to minister one of the thousands of mohammadans came up to the platform as she stood before for me a missionary to the muhammadans began to softly implore the Lord oh for that precious Soul oh for that precious Soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he had seen only one muhammadin come to receive Jesus Christ as Savior they originally were the MEO Persians whose laws change not so once a Muhammad in always a muhammadin and we know that's the Islamic faith they are so hard to win it seems that once a Muhammad and always a Muhammad and is the law amongst them well as she stood before me I G began to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters I said is it not is it not not so that the missionaries have told you of a Jesus who came to save you you should have seen the people look at each other when I said that then when they had answered that I was correct I went on and said but did the missionaries read to you out of this book I held my Bible aoft for them to see that this same Jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down Through the Ages until he came again to receive them unto himself just makes it real so beautiful did they tell you that because of the Same Spirit in them that was in Jesus that they would be able to do the mighty works even as Jesus did I think this is something that we definitely need to study and highlight and remember because what he's talking about is the life of a Believer when we meet people that are struggling in their lives they need something we have something Jesus is more than just a tradition he's more than just a a church affiliation amen he's the living Christ inside of us people need to see this he says did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved many people can believe for salvation but healing is just a little bit difficult because doctors don't talk about salvation doctors don't want nothing to do with that but they want everything to do with the body and the healing and and sickness and all of the symptoms in our lives and we know that the devil will speak through doctors but I want to say this brothers and sisters I'm not going to be a fool I'm not going to act like a fool the devil will speak through preachers too this is where we have to know where we stand as Believers is the word coming from the pulpit truth because if it's not truth the signs and wonders aren't going to follow did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see this same Jesus come down amongst us and do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth long ago I could just imagine if I was there I'd be going amen I'd be jumping up and down see me I want to see see it I want to see it he's the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters my sorry I get a little excited over this it's just beautiful how many of you would like to see this same Jesus come down amongst us and do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they surely agreed on now remember this is $100,000 people many different tribes fences between policemen to keep the order what a a meeting this must have been he said I I then went on if Jesus by his spirit will do what he did when upon the Earth will you believe his word then and here was that muhammadan woman in front of me the spirit began to move through me I said to her now you know that I don't know you I can't even speak your language she admitted that I said as for healing you you know I cannot but you heard the message this afternoon and UND excuse me understood me her Indian interpreter answered back for her that she understood for she had read the New Testament now the muhammadans are descendants of Abraham they believe in one God but they reject Jesus as the Son of God and instead they take Muhammad as his Prophet they say that Jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priests and they believe it I said but Jesus did die and raise again he sent his Spirit back upon the church that spirit that was in him is the very same spirit spirit in the church now and it can and will produce what Jesus produced that's a pretty strong statement to say but you know I think brothers and sisters once in a while it won't hurt us to be able to say that statement I think it takes a bit of courage to do it though because when we start talking like that the devil's going to be right there on your shoulder saying really when was the last time you saw it really you remember what you said really remember what you did remember what you thought etc etc etc don't listen to it just speak the word and let God back it up we can't back up the word that's the whole thing the devil wants us to back up the word with our experience with our thoughts with our failures or our successes they have nothing to do with it it's all Jesus Christ he said in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now then if Jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you are here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future she said to her interpreter yes I can I said all right may he do it those muhammadans were watching intently they were all leaning forward to see what would happen can you imagine the tension the anticipation then the Holy Spirit spoke your husband is a short heavy set man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctor's about three days ago and he gave you an examination you have a cyst on the womb she bowed her head and said that's true I asked her how is it you came to me a Christian why didn't you go to your Muhammad and Prophet she said I think you can help me isn't that wonderful just like hadie R to speak the word I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he will help you he's the same yesterday today and forever when we see people that have great needs in their lives brothers and sisters he's ready and able more than willing and able to deliver those people I just can't help but think about it we're living in an age like that dream that that that Vision that brother brandham had remember what he talked about where he saw those those people tra behind the bars in a cave and he saw them and they were in there and they were struggling and they didn't know what to do and and we know that brother bradam he wanted to watch them he wanted to see what was going on in the end the Lord just said to them deliver those people and what did he say House of Hell give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe brothers and sisters that wasn't just exclusive for the prophet now it's get me fired up that's for the Bride of Jesus Christ we see people trapped in cages all over the place we have the ability to give them Freedom Liberty by the spirit because where the spirit of the Lord is there is it's not just to dance and run up and down the aisles it's to be free to live free to recognize you don't have to live in the bondage that you live in I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior we got to get the right step right he'll heal but why would we want to be healed to die I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he will help you she said I accept Jesus as my savior and that did it she was healed and about 10,000 muhammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us an Open Door door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave Paul his great and effective Ministry in 1 Corinthians 2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power and I can tell you right now as I speak these words I hear the devil trying to chirp me off saying where's the demonstration of spirit and power in your life brother Barry I'm not looking for that I'm looking for the word I'm putting the word first and he'll do the rest I don't have to do it it's not my responsibility that's his my responsibility is to put the word first listen to me now he says it was a while on this same trip that as I was boarding a plane at new Salsbury Rhodesia that I saw a party of four with American passports I went over to them and said hello there I see you have American passports are you traveling somewhere the young man answered me no we are all missionaries here how nice I replied are you on your own or do you work with some organization we are methodists we come from Wilmore Kentucky he said well that's almost in my backyard I replied you wouldn't be that brother brandom that comes from up that way would you I said yes that's right that cured him he wouldn't say say another thing and the way he and those three girls just looked back and forth at each other so I said just a minute son I'd like to speak to all of you about some principles seeing we are all Christians and here for a great purpose now you say you have all been here for two years this is just stunning can you say in the name of Jesus that you can put your finger on one soul that you know you have one to the Lord they could not do it I don't want to hurt your feelings girls I said but you all ought to be home helping your mothers with the dishes scathing words today with all the liberal theologians all of the liberal thinking scathing words today h he says you haven't any business out on the field unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost I love how he says this this applies not just to women this applies to men you haven't got any business out on the field unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost and preaching the true gospel in the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost if you are not seeing the results that Jesus said you would see it's because you are not preaching the true gospel Let Me Go a step further and show you just how things can be on the mission field I don't say it's all this way but I am afraid too much of it is well I was on the same trip and touring around Durban with the mayor that I saw a native with a tag around his neck just check for time and he was packing an idol I asked my friend what that tag was for and he said that was when a native embraced Christianity they put a tag on him that sure surprised me for here was a man calling himself a Christian and carrying that Idol this just got me wondering brothers and sisters how many of us call ourselves Christians but we pack an idol there's many different Idols sometimes it's a job sometimes it's a career sometimes it's maybe even a Ministry sometimes maybe it can be it could be anything tradition something from our family I I come from a Pentecostal background so I can I can have a little bit of a Pentecostal slant maybe a Pentecostal Idol and say that we should do things this way but you know what we have to do we got to cast down all reasoning Paul the Apostle to the Gentile Church said he had to take all of his idols and count them as dung and accept Jesus Christ to be his Lord but here was a man calling himself a Christian and carrying that Idol so I asked him asked how that could be he said I can speak his language let's go over and talk to him so we went over and the mayor acted as my interpreter I asked the native if he was a Christian he affirmed that surely he was a Christian I then asked why he carried the idol if he was a Christian he answered that it was an idol his father had carried and left it to him I just can't help but think sometimes our parents can leave us idols and you know sometimes it's not an idol that's perceivable sometimes there's generational curses they're real but when you come to know Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection there ain't not one curse from any generation past or future that has any power over you brothers and sisters the devil's going to say oh no you do no no no you've got that genetic that's from before and as long as you say I've got that genetic you're packing an idol take that Idol and throw it down and smash it to bits you're never going to live above your confession he answered that it was an idol his father had carried and left to him when I told him that no Christian CHR ought to carry Idols he replied that this Idol had been of great use to his father I was curious to know how and he said that one day his father was being stalked by a lion so he built a fire and spoke to the idol the way he had been taught by the witch doctor the lion left I informed him that it was the fire that sent the lion off as fire scared s all wild animals I will never forget his reply he said well if it is this way if amoya the spirit fails then this Idol won't can you imagine a detailed account of the African campaign may be found in the book a prophet visits South Africa that is just about all the strength the Christian multitudes have because the word was not brought to them by the original Open Door of Pentecost I think it's such a beautiful thing I'm probably going to preach on it for a while we we we're we've been given the openest of doors the culmination of seven Church ages all the Revelation all the loose ends tied up in the Bible all that Adam had lost has been restored back back to who some people want to say William marry and bradam it was wasn't William Mary and bradam he never came and died on the cross he doesn't Deliver us from our sin he came to introduce a bride of his own choosing Christ's own choosing this is just about all the strength the Christian multitudes have because the word has not brought them brought to them by the original Open Door Pentecost now getting back to the open Mission door of the Philadelphian age it did not have the open door of power it ought to have had notice in the same verse where he mentions this open door he says Thou Hast little strength that is right the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached it was well able to make Souls wise unto salvation but the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise God it was growing and had increased over what they had in the Reformation it was in this age that the man we often call the father of missions went oute William kery a village Shoemaker who pastored the particular Baptist Church at Molton England mightily aroused by the People by preaching on whether the command given to the apostles to teach All Nations was not obligatory on all succeeding ministers to the end of the world seeing that the accompanying promise was of equal extent now that's a mouthful he was fought by the Calvinists who had gone to the extreme of the doctrine of election believing that all who will be saved will be saved and missionar work would be against the work of the spirit but Andrew Fuller helped Mr Cary by his preaching and fundraising such was their effect that a society was formed to spread the gospel to all nations in 1792 this Society sent out Carrie who was signally blessed of God in winning souls in India in 1795 an aroused Christianity formed in the London missionary society which we well know raised millions of pounds and sent thousands of missionaries over the years to accomplish the desires of the Lord the spirit of God was moving and other sheep might well have been the Cry of the heart of those Earnest Believers I have set before thee an open door I want to look at these words again this time though I am not going to disassociate them from missions I'm going to bring you a thought which carries deep into the last age as I have already stated this age melts into the last age it was in this age Jesus said I come quickly verse 11 and of the last age he was going to finish the work and to cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth that's Romans 9:28 notice how this verse of how this verse of Revelations 3:8 goes Open Door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three now what does the door signify John 10:7 then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep that is right I am present tense I am is the door of the sheep now this is not just a quaint expression this is actually so notice in John 10 when Jesus is giving this Parable he calls himself the shepherd then he calls himself the door and that is what the shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually the door and as I study that and read that I think that's a pretty heavy sentence right there it's a lot of responsibility when I was over in the East I saw that at night time the shepherd would gather all his sheep together he would put them in the fold then he would count them when he was sure they were all in he would lie down in the open door of the fold and literally become the the door to the fold no one could get in or out except by him he was the door it's just I'm sorry when I pause like that sometimes it just makes my brain go off like fireworks I just want to start preaching and I have to just no one could get in or out except by him he was the door the next day as I was went riding with a friend in a jeep I noticed that a Shepherd began to lead his flock into the city right away all traffic came to a stop so the Sheep could go through now the cities over in the East aren't like they are here we keep all our merchandise inside but there it is like a big farmers market with all the produce on the pavement for passer by passers by to go see and buy I thought oh my here is where the riot begins wait till those sheep see all that food out there but as the shepherd went ahead those sheep just followed right along exactly in each step they would look they would look at all those goodies but not a sheep touched a thing oh if I could only have known their language I would have stopped traffic myself and preach them a sermon on what I had just seen when you you are sheep that belong to the great Shepherd you follow right along in each of his steps just as those sheep did you won't be tempted to turn aside for some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some DD or PhD or lld but you'll stay with the shepherd the Bible says that the Sheep know his voice and they follow him but a stranger's voice will only cause them to flee and run after their true Shepherd praise God but that was not all I saw and learned over there one day I got to thinking about having seen men out in the fields hurting different kinds of animals one fellow would be tending some pigs another some goats another some camels another some mules Etc so I asked a friend who lived there what they called those men oh he replied they are Shepherds I couldn't take that I said you don't mean to say they are all Shepherds Shepherds only her sheep don't they no he said a Shepherd is a herder or Grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a Shepherd well that did not surprise well that did surprise me but I noticed a difference between those herders and the ones who took care of the sheep come night time all the others but The Shepherd of the sheep left his animals in the field and went home the shepherd took his sheep with him and put them into the fold and then lay down and became the door of the sheep oh praise God Our Shepherd never leaves us or forsakes US when night time comes I want to be in his fold I want to be in his care now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him so brothers and sisters when we talk about Revelation we're talking about an Open Door an Open Door into the sheep fold and we have the opportunity to get in before that she Shepherd closes the door just like Noah got into the ark Noah never closed the door the shepherd closed the door and it's the same thing today brothers and sisters we can get into that Sheepfold through the Revelation that we're getting that we have and you know what one day God's going to close that door and the weird thing is nothing's going to change we might set for 40 days we might set for seven days Noah sat for seven days it might be exactly the same but one day our bodies will change that's what this Open Door will bring to the believer what is it but the revelation of him and that Revelation is opening up to bring us strength to eliminate the word and glorify his name such a beautiful statement to open the word and to glorify his name not not to see Mighty signs and wonders not to create great Miracles and open schools and and go out and and preach the gospel no no no it's a totally different time now it's a gleaning time it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was God how else could he be our savior but to know that he was only God or God alone and that he was the Alpha and Omega and this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and Holy Ghost all one person that had been lost since the first church age but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back my now this is where I want to start but I can see we're running out of time quickly this brothers and sisters is the Crux of the message to understand what we just read this paragraph to understand godhead it's not to explain it away to say well the the father is here and the son is here and the Holy Ghost is there and you know and and go on and on like some liberal theologians of this message can do what it is is to bring us to the realization that God is God Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost spirit is the spirit of Jesus Christ the traits the actions the behavior that we're going to see in people that have the Holy Ghost is going to be just like Jesus Christ if it's not like Jesus Christ it's not the Holy Ghost he says indeed the godhead is not a three person God with one personality for it takes personality to make a person if there is one personality there is but one person now they'll just take us and pigeon hole us and say well you're Oneness you're just Oneness that's all it is right right let's just keep reading here but they who believe in three persons have a three good godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation of the godhead is back now the true church can build in strength again again after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just like they did at Pentecost I don't know I feel like I should quit because I think I will I'll call the musicians I don't want to rush through this next part I'll just read a little bit to get into it we'll come back and pick it up next week Lord willing he says let me tell you of of a god-given dream I had about Triune baptism this was not a vision but a dream you know I am sure that one of the blessings of the church Ages was to receive Dreams by the Holy Ghost just the same as one can receive Visions it was about 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning I had just gotten up to get Joseph a drink of water when I lay down I fell asleep and and instantly dreamed this dream I saw a man that I supposed was my father he was a great big Burly man I also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a log and you set set it up on end and hit it with an axe it makes a three cornered wedg like piece of firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down as she would lie there crying she would walk around he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his face was such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction in beating up a poor little woman every time time she tried to get up he would hit her I did not like what he was doing but as I considered stopping him I thought I can't tackle the man he's too big then he's supposed to be my father but down inside side I knew he wasn't my father and I knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that I went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when I said that my muscles grew and I looked like a giant the man saw them and he was scared of me I said you strike her again and you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream Left Me Maybe stand with me as we close tonight I'm going to leave off there I think it's just uh a tremendous segue into a very important part of the message to recognize the Triune gospel to recognize that sometimes we can cause hurt hurt in spouses by the idols that we pack and not even realize it but we've been given an Open Door brothers and sisters we've been given Deliverance let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you for the open door Lord Jesus and most of all the invitation Lord we know that we've heard our names spoken by you and our desire is to step through that door and father to never look back to never step back out of that
