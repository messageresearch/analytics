the door we love you and we thank you and we just commit all things into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians you have your Bibles tonight want to continue on with our studying the exposition of the seven Church ages I believe this is number 59 n thank you brother Toby for the special yes sure means a lot to have a special in a service it just brings an atmosphere Revelations chapter 3 verse4 and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true Witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire and it's so beautiful we got into that last week and that is character I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me isn't that beautiful doesn't say if only a specific group If any man hear my voice to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also came and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord your word said that if any man will hear your voice and open the door unto you that you'll come in and father we know that you declared at the end of every single Church age he that hath an ear let him hear because not everyone can hear thank you many people would like to hear but only a few people really can and Lord Jesus we just pray that you would help us tonight father to hear Lord that you would grant that to us Lord if maybe there's something that we've never heard before Lord that you would just grant us a little nugget tonight father something that would touch our heart that maybe we would never have seen before or heard before Lord we pray that Lord you would just Quicken this word to our souls amen yes and we'll be careful to give you all the praise Lord we love you and we thank you we just commit the rest of this service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly had a wonderful weekend with brother Cadre here and two Services amen and I believe the Lord spoke you know we have choices we can make choices and uh the choices that we make declare who we are amen but the interesting part about that is sometimes we just make bad choices as humans but we know the Lord is always forgiving he's always willing to help us and and uh yeah we're just certainly thankful for the the ministry brother Cadre he's been a real blessing to the assembly here over the years and certainly enjoyed having him here we uh just have a few announcements we've got the men's meeting coming up on the 26th and we've canceled the service so that will be next week I believe Wednesday we will have the men's meeting in the basement we have uh you know something's come up and uh I don't know what I can say other than I just have to go with the way I feel led um I will be traveling to Philippines as well and uh it's not my desire to go I really don't want to be traveling but uh here I find myself going I just I felt led to go so I have to go so I'll be going on the 27th and uh I'll be coming back on the 11th and uh I'll be meeting up with brother mvin and we're going to attend the uh the Asians ministers conference brother Nester emailed me this on the 28th of November and I declined it then I said no I'm not coming um but I feel that to go now so anyways um if I seem nervous about it if I seem uneasy about it I do feel uneasy about it but I I just have to go like I said with the leadership of the Lord so we'll trust something will be a blessing to someone somehow in lie of me being here we have Sunday March the 2nd brother John panicker is going to take the service Wednesday March the 5th we're going to begin playing The Message Church order 1963 12:26 it's an hour and 50ish minutes so uh prepare for a long service no I wouldn't do that I wouldn't do that at all we'll just play maybe half an hour of it uh on top of the service maybe we'll just find a a good spot to stop it and then we'll pick up and do it again once I return uh I do plan to get into church order preaching on it but for now we'll just uh we'll just say what the prophet said and uh let him say it and we'll get into talking about a little bit later so uh the second we have brother John panicker uh the fifth which is Wednesday we have uh the church order and then on the 7th we have the prayer meeting and then Sunday March the 9th brother Toby is going to take the service for us so we certainly thank the brothers for stepping in and putting their shoulders to the wheel and ministering What the Lord Has put on their hearts we have uh yeah a tremendous uh blessing of gifts in the body musically and ministerially if that's even a word I I just think it's wonderful to see so many brothers with a desire to minister so pray for our brothers if you could pray for me that the Lord will just settle it in my heart what uh the purpose is for going and uh we certainly will'll thank the Lord for his Tender Mercies last week we uh left off uh in the church age book in the leoan church age talking about elective love I'm just going to pick up from that that paragraph right after Romans 9911 and brother bradam well maybe I'll just read Romans 9:11 here it says for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth now brother Bram in here he says this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from Human Merit so there's nothing that we can do to make him love us more or to make him love us less it's elective love am that's just so powerful and his love for them is apart from Human Merit for it is for it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself because before the children were born he had already said Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and now he says to own as many as I love I rebuke and chasen to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction chasen does not mean punish it means discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind this is exactly what we find in Hebrews I think it's so amazing when we read this because if you look at it what what he's trying to express here is that God isn't looking to just slap us around like a dictator he's looking to correct us to go the right way but many times in a denominational spin the devil will creep in to the framework of the Christian church and cause it to become lukewarm formal and Powerless because it feels like we can never really succeed his love is elective if we're elected then we're elected period we can't make ourselves elected and we can't make ourselves Not Elected it's such an amazing thought but we will always choose the right way if we are elected amen amen we will always do that and the right way is going to be according to God's word but I just love this thought because it doesn't mean that you know if we leave service tonight and we go and sin We Fall Down down we have a problem in our life he's not going to take us and crush us and force us to love him he's going to love us and through that we're going to love him now I'm not saying God is not a just God he ain't a Doty old grandpa that's just going to sit up in heaven in another dimension and say it's okay you don't have to worry about it have some candy no no he's going to say I'm going to judge you according to my word and because you're elected you're going to behave according to my word and if you don't behave according to my word then are you elected that's really the age in which we're living in and that's where we get to tonight I think it's really powerful it's such a wonderful thing and you know I think that this church age book what it does for me I just have to tell you my heart is it shows me what it means to be redeemed the entirety of this book from the beginning up until where we're at right now it just shows redeemed redeemed redeemed redeemed and when we get that Revelation about being redeemed we understand that he is our Heavenly lover amen he does not want to abuse us he doesn't want to mistreat us he doesn't want to punish us he just wants to correct us so we'll go the right way am what a loving father Hebrews 125-1 and ye have forgotten the exort and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him I just want to throw this out there just for the sake of discussion how do we become chastened or rebuked by the Lord how does that happen now I'm not going to answer it I want to let that linger I want us to think about that when the chastening of the Lord or the rebuking of the Lord comes how does that happen for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth and if you endure chastening if you're willing to actually endure it God deal with you as with the son for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are part partakers then ye are bastards and not sons that means you have no father furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasen us after our own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness yes now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of Love Of Joy Of Peace of longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness and Temperance yes the fruit of the spirit the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby herein is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself yes therefore before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay now out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing amen then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk isn't that beautiful and you know brothers and sisters he's not saying that it's going to be that we're not going to maybe walk with a bounce in our step or we're going to change the way we walk it's not that at all it's that we're going to walk according to the word of God in our lives we're going to conduct ourselves according to the word of God in our lives whether it's in school whether it's at home whe whether it's at work whether it's in church that's what we're going to do that's the walk he's talking about he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands amen can you imagine what it's going to be like to shake the hand of Jesus sometimes I shake hands and I'll use my second hand just to give a little extra love can you imagine what that would be like to hold that hand and to feel it to look at it and to think that that's actually the hands that that that corrected me why he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be so I just can say this when we go through the trial it's his love it's that elected love amen that we read about there he says oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together and as a threefold cord is not easily broken that's out of Proverbs they will have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritual satanical power yes and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure amen fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he John 13:1 having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end am and we know we read that just before for the communion service amen he loved them unto the end yes be zealous and repent now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up John 2:17 but it is a wrong Zeal for it is the house of their own building it is for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness I say Lord let there not be any righteousness of my own be found in me but let it be yours because we know that ourselves are but filthy rags before him our own righteousness he says they have put the word out for their own ideas their own ideas they deposed the whole Holy Ghost and made men into leaders that's why the Holy Ghost leads the church that's why every church is Sovereign they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even Church Conformity rather than good works how many people have actually seen churches in the message that make Church Conformity rather than good works my but God is calling for another Zeal isn't that beautiful it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong now who is going to say that he's wrong what is it that all these denominations are based upon the claim to originality and that of God the claim that they are right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they are Whited selers full of Dead Man's Bones they have no life they have no Vindication God has never made himself known in any organization they say they are right because they are the ones that are saying it but saying it doesn't make it so and it doesn't matter how many people say it right it doesn't make it right they need the Vindicated thus say the Lord of God and they don't have it I was just going over this and I was thinking isn't it amazing to think that there was a thus sayith the Lord given to the world but it was thoroughly rejected there was a thus sayith the Lord given to Israel in Jerusalem but they thoroughly rejected it and you know the thus sayith the Lord even came when their city was under siege and they rejected it the thus sayith the Lord in that day said hey if you just go out and surrender yourself humble yourself in the sight of the Lord to the king out there and what will happen is you'll be a slave for the rest of your life but you'll live but they couldn't do it they would not my I think it's amazing it's it's human nature outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's us right that's right outside of the Holy Ghost in our lives that Is Us full of Dead Man's Bones we have no life we have no Vindication God has never made himself known to us because we have our own organization I so thank the the the ministry of brother Ken bringing that thought it will never leave me that we can be a denomination of one I can have my views and my ideas about this message of the hour and nobody can change me because I can say that I feel led but if we feel led it's going to be according to the word it will not be outside of the word so when we see someone saying I feel led and it's contrary to the word guess what I want to say this I believe that it's the Lord chastening the Lord reproving amen because sometimes we can get Wayward sometimes we can go astray every one of us all of us have gone astray but it's the Lord that does it for us they say they are right because they are the one saying it but saying it doesn't make it so they need the Vindicated thus saith the Lord of God and they don't have it now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false Church to repent right in this verse he's calling to his elect amen they have some repenting to do too many of his children are still in those false churches they are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5:4 14 awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light we talked many times about the five wise and the five unwise virgins all of them were virgins all of them had oil all of them slumbered and slept but only five of them half of them had enough oil and we know the oil typifies the Holy Ghost amen that's why we come to church so we could just get that little tiny filling every time just a little more Lord just a little more Lord just a little more Lord here's my cup I lift it up fill my cup Lord I just need a little more there's a desire to have enough oil cuz without enough oil our lamps will go out and we know what happens amen when that judgment call comes forward Behold The Bride bridegrooms come enter in amen some of the people are going to be saying but I just don't have enough oil and it's going to be so sad because there's an abundance of oil oh my there's a fountain open in the House of David brother BR he goes on to say to be asleep is not to be dead isn't that beautiful these are sleeping amongst the dead they are out there in the dead denominations they are floating along with them God cries wake up repent of your Folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money Act actually their very lives to these Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it's right they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward the truth but you know it's it's interesting because I just every time I hear that I just can't help but think of that that story of the truth that would set him free standing right in front of pilate and pilate saying what is truth right exactly man I'm a leader I'm a boss I can tell people to come I can tell people to go I got it all we've got it all going on I'm rich increased with Goods I have need of nothing I have the power to take your life or to set you free but I can't see truth my some people are blind amen the rain falls on the just and the unjust just exactly alike my they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn towards the truth yes this is the age that most needs to repent but will it will it bring back the word will it again enthrone the holy spirit in men's lives will it again rever Jesus as the only savior I say not for the next verse reveals the astounding and shocking truth of the close of this age Revelations 3:20 to 22 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now there's a great deal of confusion over this verse because so many personal workers use it in personal evangelism as though Jesus were at the hearts door of every sinner knocking for admission it would then be said that if the sinner opened the door the Lord would come in but this verse is not talking to individual sinners this whole message has a summation as does every message in every age in verse 22 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so this is the message to the Church of the last age it is the condition of the leodan church as its end near it is not a personal message to one person it is to this it is the spirit telling us us where Jesus is Christ has left the church that's such a strong statement my it is not the logical result or end if the word is put aside for creed sorry is this not The Logical result or end if the word is put aside for Creed the Holy Spirit deposed for popes Bishops presidents coun C ilor Etc and the savior is set aside for a Works program or church joining or some type of Conformity to a church system what more can be done against him this is apostasy this is the falling away it's so strange because if you look at the way he's describing the church they're not falling away they're Gathering together and and and doing great Mighty works even in his name but we know we just read that he's left the church my this is the open door to Antichrist for if one came in his father's name Jesus and was not received but rejected then there will come another with his own name liar in Brackets liar a Pretender in Brackets and him they will receive John 5:34 the man of sin that son of predition will take over you know brothers and sisters that's not just in the church as a whole that's in men's Hearts Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens concerning the last day just before Jesus comes I wonder if you noticed such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth we have been discussing that truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until the last age he has pushed outside the church recall that in the first age it was almost a full orbit Church of Truth yet there was a little error called the Deeds of the nicians that kept the circle from being full and remember when you have the the nians the Conquering the the Ley niiko leans when you have that you also have bmismart the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ but he is the sun isn't it beautiful that in 1965 brother bradam preached it is the rising of the Sun not s n s o n amen because there comes a time where the Church of the Living God is no longer going to reflect God oh my they're going to be God H the literal manifestation of God back on Earth again the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a sliver in the fourth age but the fifth age it began to grow in the sixth age it took a great step of growth forward in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and waned almost to nothingness so that instead of light it was Blackness of apostasy and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for Darkness had taken over Christ was now outside the church here is the sign in the sky the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to a total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage the total darkness came as the the pope of Rome Paul v 6 went to Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to Jerusalem the pope is named Paul I 6 Paul was the first messenger and this man goes by that name excuse me notice it is the sixth or the number of a man this is more than a coincidence and he went to Jerusalem the moon or the Church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come quickly now we can see why there were two Vines one true one false now we can see why Abraham had two sons one after the flesh that persecuted Isaac and one after the promise now we can see that how that sorry now we can see how that out of the same parents two boys came forth as twins one knowing and loving the things of God and the other knowing much of the same truth but not of the same spirit and hence persecuted the child that was elect God did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect just I mean I'm just going to pause there you know where this is going you know what I'm thinking you it's what we he sent it to us for a purpose brothers and sisters when we see persecution deliberate character assassination going on you've got to wonder it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect oh those reprobates are relig they are smart they are of the cane line the serpent seed and we would never want to put that label on anyone I don't believe the elect would ever want to put that label on anyone personally just my thoughts just my heart I believe the reprobates would be the ones putting that label on people yes sir because I believe the elect would that everyone would be saved that everyone would have the desire to come to the knowledge of the truth just like the spirit of Christ the elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect oh those reprobates are religious they are smart they are of the can line the serpent seed they build their bables they build their cities they build their Empires and all the while calling on God they hate the true seed and they will do all they can even in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elect ones but they're needed they're needed why are they needed what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff no wheat right right so brothers and sisters I'm just the way the prophet has put this together the way the Holy Ghost did through the prophet what he's talking about is those reprobates are not out there in the denominations he immediately draws a parallel with chaff with the wheat so where's that chaff but at the end what happens to the chaff it is burned with fire on quenchable and the wheat where is it it is gathered into the Garner it is where he is just like the story of Joseph where were his Brethren his Brethren came to the Palace but he said hey wait a second I need a moment and he sent his wife away she was actually not even where there when he revealed himself to his Brethren it's the same thing today it' be the same thing in Israel when he reveals himself to them he goes on to say oh elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling amen rely upon God and be strong in his might your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour I just think it's so beautiful to have that kind of a warning to have that kind of a an encouragement oh elect of God beware study closely be careful work out your own salvation with fear and trembling don't want to just say hey I got it I'm good I come to church just to put my shoulder to the wheel and say amen and then I go home we're ever learning but we are coming to the knowledge of the truth it's such a beautiful thing thing brother Bram he says watch unto prayer and be steadfast This is the End Time both the true and the false Vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning see they are all joining the World Council of churches that is The Binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two Spirits are at work in two Vines come out from among the tears start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your lord to and fit to Reign and Rule with him I think it's beautiful as I was studying this you know I uh I just got into the thought he says here that uh my soon the garnering of the wheat will will come this is in 1965 he was saying this I can't help but think the garnering of the wheat is already happening he said that he would send his angels we're going to get into it a little bit here he would send his angels to actually do the separating should should the should the people when they see things going on should they go and tear up tear up the tears but we know Jesus said if you do that then you'll root up the wheed as well just let them all grow and the angels will come and do the separ operating and you know brothers and sisters the angels are not just angels with wings that are going to fly down from heaven and and do the reaping they're actual messenger angels that bring the word of God through seven ages and they're the ones that gather the wheat into the Garner the ones who can receive the word because we're talking about spiritual matters here we're not talking about filling a Garner full of people we're talking about people being able to have an ear to hear what the messenger what the angel what the Reaper has to say to that age Revelations 3:21 the Overcomer Throne to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome it's a great question that is a a norm that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it's not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome and I just remember so vividly brother Ken boy are preaching services on this it is not what we are to overcome because we have all manner of things to overcome but it's how we overcome it and I think it's so beautiful because we don't have to be left hanging I'm not going to say it I'm going to let the prophet say it but I just can't help get excited about it cuz it's so true it's not what we are to overcome but how we do it now this is logical for for it does matter much what we are to overcome as for does it matter how how much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at those scriptures which in involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word amen and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer amen it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming amen because that word Can't Fail amen amen I have this highlighted here this sentence here and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer it also is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word Can't Fail now notice again how Jesus overcame the World Systems of religion my how time flies when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God in Hebrews 5: 7-9 now notice again how Jesus overcame the world's systems of religion sorry sorry who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obeyed him what was he obedient to the word of God I think this is beautiful here I'm probably going to preach on this one day here don't be surprised when you see me do that I'm going to put a nice good star right there and maybe right there what is perfect brothers and sisters it's not being perfect in my hair it's not being perfect in my looks it's not being perfect in my finances it's not being perfect in my church attendance it's not being perfect in My Worship it's not being perfect in Pitch it's not being perfect in how we play the word of God says to make a Joyful Noise and it's certainly not perfect is not in our image of ourselves if that's what we've got then we've got this completely wrong the Perfection is the word of God in our lives when we're willing to allow ourselves to fully humble ourselves to the word of God there we're talking about perfection that's the only Perfection that we can do we have no Perfection on our own aside from humbling ourselves to his Perfection one day we'll get into that what was he obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been speaking that word no living that word it's all about living the word brothers and sisters and and I would say yay not us living but him Living Through Me amen the Lord Jesus Christ Living that word when that happens when we rise up and we actually come against that word uhoh he tells us and what do we do humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord amen it's got to be him that's what he is obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances and I'm going to say visions and dreams no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you privilege of sitting in that Throne amen it will be granted only to the word bride and what's the word bride the one that's willing to Humble herself in the sight of the Lord how do you humble yourself in the sight of the Lord you say Lord I take your word even if it takes my hide off take it off I don't want it it's got to be your word yes sir so beautiful it will only be granted to the word bride oh my brother bradam says it in uh in uh is it the rising of the sun there's been many churches churches and Brides brides but there's got to be one there's got to to be one and that's going to be a word Bride As The Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that Throne remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the World Church system this Leo Dean age ends in a blackout of the word and I mean how much further does it have to go how much farther does it have to go brothers and sisters I'm going to say it and maybe get myself in trouble for it but I'm going to say it because it's true and it's against the word of God there are lesbian ministers lesbian pastors how much farther does it need to go my and because everyone's doing it it's okay it's against the word this leoan age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure from the Lord from the midst and you know brothers and sisters maybe I just used to call it a gross maybe depiction of it the epitome of it but one word off is just as bad to be clear we can have all the perversion in the world but one word off guilty of the least is guilty of the whole I say Lord don't let me be guilty he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word that's how we follow him I have that part highlighted too by obedience to the word that's how we follow him after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little haunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus you know many times I thought about this and how we could look back and see in history how there was the maybe the SS groups and how they persecuted the Jews and they really did persecute the Jews I am not disputing that for a second but what I am getting at what what I think the Lord was showing me as I was studying this here is maybe this persecution isn't necessarily going to be to the slaughter of the Bride of Jesus Christ because the prophet said very clearly that he does not have to let her go through the tribulation to be judged to be righteous enough to be his bride if she is his bride he has already seen her wash herself and she's already judged herself so that she doesn't need to be judged again so what I'm getting at is perhaps this persecution I'm just saying this perhaps this persecution is simply a word persecution against the Bride of Jesus Christ but what is going to be a powerful demonstration by the spirit brothers and sisters what can be more powerful than being able to stand upon this word in the midst of a perverse generation like we live in yes don't look for signs and wonders look for the ability to stick with this word that's my point with this this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus my consummation of the Gentile ages this age is the last of the seven Church ages what began in the first or Ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last or leodan age the two fines the two Vines will yield their fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sewing the watering the growing is all over summer is ended the sickle is now thrust in to the Harvest in verses 15 to 18 this is revelations 35-18 in Revelation uh yeah 3 15 to 18 uh in which we have just studied lies the true picture of the ripened false fine false Spirit false church people I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot yes right so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me character tried in the fiery furnace of Affliction is what we read earlier I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see I'll call the musicians so I don't keep us here because boy I've got some highlighting coming up some good stuff in here hallelujah brother bramy says here no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more yet in verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne we find the True Vine true Spirit true church people exalted to the very Throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast steadfast spiritual group in the words of John the Baptist who so accurately set forth the church in relationship to the true and false church now comes to pass in Matthew 3:11-12 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance maybe stand with me as we read this but he that cometh after me is mightier than I who shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire you know brother Bram in his ministry he came and he was told as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming your ministry will forerun the second coming I believe it's no accident that we would read a scripture like this in here I I indeed baptize you with water and repentance unto repentance and isn't that what brother bradam did brought back true water baptism into the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remittance of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosten I think it's just beautiful God bless you tonight brothers and sisters I trust this word is just a a blessing to us all and we can just work out our own salvation with fear and trembling let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this wonderful group of people here tonight Lord that desire more of you we know what it means to sacrifice of our Lives Lord to put down the Affairs that we have to tend to to break the cycle of our life in the middle of the week to come and

Prophet to be thus they saith the Lord to us help it to become real to us father help us to grow thereby and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise we thank you for speaking to us once
