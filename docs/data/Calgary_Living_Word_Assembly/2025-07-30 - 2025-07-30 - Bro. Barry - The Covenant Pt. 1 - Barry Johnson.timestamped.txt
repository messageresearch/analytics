[12:35] Thank you.
[19:03] God bless you.
[19:05] Welcome to church.
[19:08] Thank the Lord for his goodness on our
[19:10] lives. We pray that the fullness of his
[19:12] blessings will be our portion tonight.
[19:14] Um we're not gathered here to see each

[44:52] salvation.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[44:59] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[45:12] Heat.
[45:21] Heat.
[45:32] in the light
[45:35] of his glory
[45:37] and grace.
[45:42] Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[45:45] the house of the Lord. Certainly
[45:48] privileged to be gathered together one
[45:50] more time in his name.
[45:53] We know that we we don't know how many
[45:56] more times we're going to be able to do
[45:59] this.
[46:01] The way the world is, the condition that
[46:04] it's in, the birth pains that it's going
[46:07] through,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; we know that it can't stand very much
[46:10] more.
[46:12] And yet, we have the opportunity
[46:15] to turn our eyes upon Jesus.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you each one. Certainly
[46:21] like to welcome the Robson family here
[46:24] from Arizona. God bless you. If you have
[46:28] a need tonight, maybe just make it known
[46:30] unto him by wave an uplift hand as we go
[46:32] to him in prayer.
[46:36] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[46:38] you for this day. Thank you for this
[46:39] opportunity one more time to gather
[46:41] together, Lord, in the name above every
[46:45] name.
[46:46] The name that causes demons to tremble.
[46:51] And Father, tonight we don't just gather
[46:54] around your name, but Father, we gather
[46:57] around your life
[47:00] &gt;&gt; because it's the life behind the name
[47:03] &gt;&gt; that makes the demons tremble.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And we know that it's the life behind
[47:08] the name that gives us the very breath
[47:10] in our lungs, the very spark in our
[47:13] minds, Lord, and the life promise in our
[47:17] soul. So, Father, tonight Lord, as we go
[47:20] forwards in this service, we just want
[47:22] to reverence you, Lord, as the King of
[47:24] Kings and Lord of Lords, the author and
[47:28] the finisher of our faith. And Lord
[47:30] Jesus, if there's a need in our midst
[47:33] tonight, Father, we pray that you would
[47:35] sovereignly meet it according to your
[47:37] will, which is your word. And Father,
[47:39] we'll be careful to give you the praise.
[47:42] Lord Jesus, we know that your word is
[47:44] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[47:46] two-edged sword. Oh, Father, that it's
[47:50] able to, Lord, move between the joints
[47:53] and the marrow, Lord, to get right
[47:55] between, Lord Jesus, the soul and the
[47:58] spirit. And, Father, to make it right to
[48:01] that place, Lord, that you had before
[48:03] the foundation of the world, created in
[48:05] every one of our hearts, Lord, that
[48:07] space that you made for yourself, Lord.
[48:10] Father, we pray that your word would
[48:12] just discern our hearts tonight, Father.
[48:15] That Lord Jesus, you would go from row
[48:17] to row, from chair to chair, from Lord,
[48:21] seat to seat, from heart to heart, Lord,
[48:23] and discern us tonight, Father. Lord
[48:26] Jesus, we pray that you would speak to
[48:28] us sovereignly now as we go forwards. We
[48:31] thank you for meeting the needs, Lord.
[48:33] Thank you for watching over us. We pray
[48:35] that you would be with all those who are
[48:37] traveling. Lord, we know that the roads
[48:39] are busy this time of year. And Lord, we
[48:42] need your traveling mercies. And we rely
[48:44] upon you. We trust you, Lord. We know
[48:47] that your word says that your angels are
[48:50] encamped about those who fear you. And
[48:52] Lord, we just are so thankful that we
[48:55] can trust you that way. Tonight, Lord,
[48:57] we pray that you would just be glorified
[48:59] now in all that's said and done, Lord,
[49:01] as we go forwards with you. In Jesus
[49:04] Christ's name we pray.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians.
[49:09] Certainly good to see everyone once
[49:12] again. We've had some traveling
[49:16] lives and ourabesses. Certainly good to
[49:19] see you.
[49:21] And each one if you have your Bibles
[49:23] tonight, I'd just like to read from two
[49:25] places. Romans chapter 4 and then we'll
[49:28] turn over to Genesis 12.
[49:32] Romans 4 verse 16.
[49:36] Genesis
[49:38] 12 verse 1.
[49:50] Romans 4 verse 16.
[49:58] Therefore, it is of faith that it might
[50:02] be by grace
[50:05] to the end the promise might be sure to
[50:08] all the seed,
[50:10] not to that only which is of the law,
[50:13] but to that also which is of the faith
[50:16] of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
[50:21] As it is written, I have made thee a
[50:24] father of many nations.
[50:27] before him whom he believed, even God,
[50:31] who quickenth the dead, and calleth
[50:34] those things which be not as though they
[50:38] were.
[50:40] Who against hope believed in hope, that
[50:43] he might become the father of many
[50:46] nations, according to that which was
[50:49] spoken,
[50:51] so shall thy seed be.
[50:54] And being not weak in faith, he
[50:57] considered not his own body now dead
[51:01] when he was about 100 years old, neither
[51:05] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. And we
[51:08] know that she was 90 years old, 10 years
[51:11] younger. Verse 20, he staggered not at
[51:17] the promise of God through unbelief,
[51:20] but was strong in faith, giving glory to
[51:24] God,
[51:25] and being fully persuaded
[51:28] that what he had promised, he was able
[51:31] also to perform.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And therefore, it was imputed to him for
[51:38] righteousness.
[51:40] Now it was not written for his sake
[51:44] alone. Glory to God.
[51:47] But it was imputed to him. But for us
[51:51] also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we
[51:55] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[51:59] Lord from the dead, who was delivered
[52:03] for our offenses, and was raised again
[52:07] for our justification.
[52:10] My goodness. Glory to God. Let's turn
[52:13] over to Genesis 12.
[52:16] Just three verses here.
[52:21] Genesis 12.
[52:27] Now the Lord had said unto Abram,
[52:33] even before he had his name change,
[52:36] Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[52:39] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[52:42] kindred, and from thy father's house
[52:46] unto a land that I will show thee,
[52:50] and I will make of thee a great nation,
[52:53] and I will bless thee, and make thy name
[52:57] great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and
[53:00] I will bless them that bless thee, and
[53:03] curse him that cursseeth thee, and in
[53:07] thee shall all the families of the earth
[53:12] be blessed.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer one more time.
[53:15] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we stand
[53:18] here as willing recipients of this word
[53:21] that we have read tonight, Lord, knowing
[53:23] that we do believe the one that that was
[53:27] that was brutally sacrificed for our
[53:30] offenses, Lord, and was risen again for
[53:33] our justification.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, Father, tonight we pray
[53:37] that you would bless this word as we go
[53:39] forwards, Lord, that you would be
[53:41] glorified in all that's said and done.
[53:43] that you would quicken this word to the
[53:46] hearer, Lord, and to the speaker,
[53:48] Father. Let us be as one, Father. Just
[53:50] one conduit connected to you tonight.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you all the
[53:55] praise. We just ask all these things in
[53:57] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. You may be
[54:02] seated.
[54:04] Welcome everyone to the house of the
[54:06] Lord and another opportunity just to
[54:09] give him glory.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just thinking about this here. You
[54:14] know, Abraham, we know full well in
[54:18] Romans chapter 4 that he staggered not
[54:22] at the promise of God's unbelief, but
[54:25] was strong in faith, giving glory to
[54:27] God. That man who was called by name,
[54:31] who had a name change, who was a
[54:34] backslider, a prophet who was a
[54:36] backsliding prophet of God, he
[54:39] staggered.
[54:41] He staggered. But you know, the
[54:43] beautiful part is he staggered not at
[54:46] the promise of God
[54:47] &gt;&gt; through unbelief. And I think that's
[54:49] just a real key. It's been such an
[54:51] encouragement for me in my life, and my
[54:53] walk to know that this prophet of God
[54:56] staggered. We all stagger, but let's not
[54:59] stagger at the promise of God through
[55:02] unbelief.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; We know this flesh is going to let us
[55:05] down. We know this flesh is cursed.
[55:08] There's no way this flesh will ever
[55:10] inherit incorruption. And many times I
[55:13] think that we strive to try and act like
[55:16] this flesh somehow someway should be
[55:19] holy. This flesh will never be holy.
[55:21] It's the soul inside of us that's holy.
[55:24] And that soul contains the spirit of
[55:26] God. That is what is holy. And the
[55:29] difference between ourselves and the
[55:32] rest of this world is that we have that
[55:34] spirit within us that says amen to the
[55:38] word of God. But not just with our lips,
[55:41] but with our hearts causing this flesh
[55:44] to live a holy life. Now, this flesh
[55:47] will live a holy life and it will defy
[55:50] all of the sinful gravity that's in this
[55:53] world. Now, I'm not talking about the
[55:54] law of gravity that would hold the
[55:56] planets in orbit. What I am saying is
[55:58] that this flesh has a gravitational
[56:00] pull, spiritually speaking, towards sin,
[56:03] which will cause us to stagger. But that
[56:07] doesn't change the promise of God in our
[56:09] soul. Oh my. Tonight, I want to speak on
[56:11] the covenant. I was just so encouraged
[56:14] by this wedding that we participated in
[56:17] on the weekend, Brother Logan and Sister
[56:19] Neve, and to see how God brought the two
[56:21] souls together. And and we know that we
[56:24] heard brother Menow say it on Sunday. I
[56:26] think it's so good that, you know, a
[56:28] marriage is not a contract.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a contractual obligation.
[56:34] It's not an obligation. And it's not
[56:37] something that we enter into so that we
[56:39] can actually just benefit something out
[56:42] of it. It's not a document that we take
[56:45] and we hang on our wall. Marriage is a
[56:48] covenant and it is until death do us
[56:52] part. But you know we know the devil
[56:56] creeps in.
[56:58] The devil loves to creep in. The devil
[57:00] loves to try and speak to us in ways
[57:03] that will reason situations in our
[57:06] lives. A and I think it's amazing how we
[57:10] can be the bride of Jesus Christ who are
[57:13] so thankful that he will never ever ever
[57:16] put us away. But sometimes you hear
[57:19] folks talk about how they have the right
[57:21] to put away their wife.
[57:24] And sure enough they do. But doesn't
[57:26] Jesus have the right to put away us?
[57:28] Shouldn't he have the right to put us
[57:30] away, to kick us out the door? If we
[57:33] look at the way things are in our lives,
[57:36] every one of us are are are born in sin
[57:38] shaped and iniquity, come into this
[57:40] world speaking lies. None of us are
[57:41] righteous. We only rely upon his grace.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; There's no holy walk that's going to
[57:47] walk our way out of here into heaven.
[57:50] There's nothing that we can do to merit
[57:52] this grace. Just take a look in Romans.
[57:54] Take a look in Ephesians. It's all by
[57:57] his grace that we're saved through
[57:58] faith. But talking about this covenant,
[58:01] I just I got so encouraged as I I
[58:04] mentioned that, you know, it's such an
[58:06] amazing thing to look at a marriage. And
[58:09] sometimes we can get so so caught up in
[58:12] our own lives. You know, brother
[58:13] Brandham, he talks about it how maybe in
[58:16] our spiritual walk, we can get our eagle
[58:19] eyes filmed over. Sometimes the the life
[58:22] inside of us grows a little bit dim.
[58:24] Maybe that lamp grows a little bit dim.
[58:25] For those people that know about the
[58:27] lamp and and how you can burn a lamp
[58:30] with oil, burn a oil lamp. Sometimes if
[58:33] you don't adjust that wick with a little
[58:36] dial, it can actually start to burn dark
[58:39] and it will actually carbon up and and
[58:41] and cloud that lamp. And that lamp still
[58:43] has the fire burning, but it's not
[58:45] burning bright. And sometimes we just
[58:47] need to actually adjust that wick. We
[58:49] need to clean the lens. We need to make
[58:52] adjustments in our lives. And brother
[58:54] Bradam talk tells a story about the
[58:56] eagle and how sometimes the eagle eye
[58:58] can get filmed over spiritually
[58:59] speaking. Sometimes that can happen in
[59:01] our marriages.
[59:03] Sometimes it can happen in our
[59:04] relationship. Sometimes it can happen in
[59:06] our spiritual walks. We can just get our
[59:09] little eagle eye filmed over
[59:13] and we begin to forget about who we are.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing that is for us to
[59:19] do. I'm just going to start tonight by
[59:21] reading a quote and it's out of 1954. I
[59:25] think I sent it, brother. Did you get
[59:26] it? 1954.
[59:29] The unconditional
[59:31] covenant
[59:33] that God made with the people.
[59:36] The unconditional covenant that God made
[59:40] with the people. Brother Brown, I mean,
[59:43] he just says right at the very beginning
[59:44] of this message, and I'm not going to do
[59:48] a bunch of quotes tonight. I feel like
[59:50] preaching and uh I'm just going to go
[59:52] with the the inspiration. But brother
[59:54] Brandham, he says, "What a promise.
[59:57] Now, in dealing with the Pentecostal
[59:59] people,
[1:00:01] and if God willing, when coming back, I
[1:00:04] have found the weak spot of Pentecostal
[1:00:07] people by God's help."
[1:00:11] that is you're scared.
[1:00:14] That's right. That's true. Now, I just
[1:00:18] couldn't help but think as I was
[1:00:19] listening to this, you know, this is
[1:00:21] food that's stored up for a season. This
[1:00:23] is not just him talking about some
[1:00:26] people will say it and and if that's as
[1:00:28] far as the revelation goes, I guess
[1:00:29] that's the way it needs to be.
[1:00:32] Excuse me. But I can't help but think
[1:00:35] when I listen to this, just like reading
[1:00:37] God's word, I've got to put myself
[1:00:38] there. And I like to think I understand
[1:00:41] the Pentecostal people is not just a
[1:00:44] group of denominational folks, even
[1:00:46] though that's what brother Brandham
[1:00:48] would be referring to there. But when we
[1:00:50] listen to this with revelation, with the
[1:00:52] the ability to to maybe listen between
[1:00:55] the lines, listen between the words, I
[1:00:58] think that brother Bradam could be
[1:01:00] speaking to a Pentecostal people who
[1:01:03] have a Pentecostal experience. They're
[1:01:06] not part of a Pentecostal denomination.
[1:01:09] We know that he said full well that
[1:01:11] rapturing faith lies on the tapes. And
[1:01:13] so I want to try and encourage us
[1:01:15] tonight, brothers and sisters. Let's try
[1:01:16] and put ourselves there. How many people
[1:01:18] are afraid to really speak the
[1:01:21] commandment of God to understand the
[1:01:23] covenant of God for fear that maybe
[1:01:25] someone would hear our words? Maybe
[1:01:27] somebody would actually think that we're
[1:01:29] just a little bit fanatical. Maybe we're
[1:01:31] going to say something that God won't do
[1:01:34] for us in our life. And the devil will
[1:01:35] say, "See, I told you. Maybe you've got
[1:01:38] some secret sin in your life. You're
[1:01:39] afraid to speak the word. Maybe you're
[1:01:41] just not sure. So, you're afraid to
[1:01:43] speak the word." He doesn't say why
[1:01:44] they're afraid. He just says they're
[1:01:46] afraid. They're scared. And I can't help
[1:01:48] but think how many people who live a
[1:01:50] Pentecostal experience in this message
[1:01:52] of the hour could be just a little bit
[1:01:54] afraid of this word. But let's talk
[1:01:57] about this. This is an unconditional
[1:02:00] govern covenant that God gave to his
[1:02:02] people. It's our inalienable
[1:02:05] right.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; We are already seated in heavenly places
[1:02:10] in Christ Jesus is what the prophet
[1:02:12] said, the word said. We know the word
[1:02:14] says that. But he says, "What a promise
[1:02:15] now in dealing with the Pentecostal
[1:02:17] people." And if God willing, when I come
[1:02:19] back, I have found the weak spot of
[1:02:21] Pentecostal people. I put myself right
[1:02:24] there by God's help because sometimes
[1:02:25] I'm scared. Sometimes I have a little
[1:02:28] bit of fear. It's our human nature. It's
[1:02:31] this fallible flesh
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; by God's help. That's you're scared.
[1:02:36] That's right. That's true. He says
[1:02:39] you're just scared to take God at his
[1:02:42] word.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And you know, I talked about this a
[1:02:45] while ago. Many times we can get afraid
[1:02:48] to take God at his word, to speak the
[1:02:50] word. But you know, brothers and
[1:02:51] sisters, it's not up to us to bring it
[1:02:52] to pass. It's up to God to bring it to
[1:02:54] pass. It's up to us just to simply
[1:02:56] believe it and step into it, to speak
[1:02:59] it, to live it. Don't be scared about
[1:03:02] it. But he says you're just scared to
[1:03:04] take God at his word. And you don't know
[1:03:06] who you are.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Does everybody here know who we are
[1:03:11] tonight?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; I want to try and remind us about who we
[1:03:15] are.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; To recognize our position in Christ and
[1:03:19] recognize Christ's position in us. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to try and dupe us out
[1:03:25] of our position. He wants to make us
[1:03:27] feel like, well, you said that, you
[1:03:29] thought that, you went there, you well,
[1:03:31] you know, on and on and on, stumbling at
[1:03:33] this flesh, stagger at this flesh, but
[1:03:35] not at the promise of God through
[1:03:37] unbelief.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Because we know that sin is unbelief.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Sin is not stumbling and falling in this
[1:03:45] flesh, brothers and sisters. That's not
[1:03:47] what it is. If we sin willfully, if we
[1:03:50] want to go run out to the barroom, if we
[1:03:52] want to go clubbing, if we want to go
[1:03:54] and do all of the worldly things, then
[1:03:56] maybe there's something a little bit
[1:03:57] wrong with us. But if we believe the
[1:04:00] word of God and we trip and fall and we
[1:04:02] land on our face and we get back up and
[1:04:04] spit the dirt out of our mouths and and
[1:04:07] wipe it off of our face and we say,
[1:04:09] "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all
[1:04:12] that's within me. Bless his holy name.
[1:04:14] It doesn't matter whether I fall down
[1:04:16] and eat the dirt. I get back up again.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Says you're just scared to take God at
[1:04:23] his word and you don't know who you are.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; See, if you only realize what position
[1:04:28] you are in heaven tonight, there'd be
[1:04:32] something take place here.
[1:04:36] Uh-huh. See?
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And I just love how he said this if
[1:04:42] you'd only realize what position you're
[1:04:44] in heaven tonight.
[1:04:48] Not this morning.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Let's take and put ourselves here.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe the prophet of God is speaking a
[1:04:54] little bit to us. Maybe God is speaking
[1:04:56] to us through the prophet
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; because that's what the prophet was sent
[1:05:00] for.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; We we didn't we didn't gather together
[1:05:04] to to celebrate cunningly devised fables
[1:05:07] that was put together by a man. We're
[1:05:08] not just following a man. We're not just
[1:05:10] getting people to the prophet. If we do
[1:05:13] that, then we're missing the point. And
[1:05:15] there's a whole push, I know, to get
[1:05:17] people to the prophet. And sure enough,
[1:05:18] we need to witness that God sent a
[1:05:20] prophet. But let's say what the prophet
[1:05:22] said. He said, "Get people to Christ."
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; We're here to get people to Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ. He's the one who died. When we
[1:05:30] read this scripture here, who was
[1:05:32] delivered for our offenses and was
[1:05:34] raised again for our justification. It
[1:05:36] was not William, Mary, and Brandham.
[1:05:37] That was Jesus Christ. The same
[1:05:39] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And we can very easily take and make
[1:05:44] this prophet an idol.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; We can turn this this message that we
[1:05:49] talk about into idolatry if we're not
[1:05:51] very careful.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; But we know, brother Adam said it, God
[1:05:55] said it through the prophet that this
[1:05:56] message will never be denominated.
[1:05:58] Never. There's no way that it will ever
[1:06:00] happen because it's literal life of
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ living out in his bride. He
[1:06:05] goes on to say, "The thing of it is many
[1:06:08] of the people are trying to put these
[1:06:10] blessings off in the millennium
[1:06:12] somewhere. Why would we need healing for
[1:06:14] our bodies in the millennium? Why would
[1:06:16] we need healing for our minds in the
[1:06:19] millennium? Why would we need healing
[1:06:21] for our marriage in the millennium? Why
[1:06:23] would we need deliverance for our
[1:06:24] children in the millennium? Why would we
[1:06:26] need preaching of the word off in the
[1:06:29] millennium?" We don't need it in the
[1:06:30] millennium. We need it right now.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; But brother Bradom says it many times.
[1:06:34] That's what people do in this age. They
[1:06:36] they put it off into the future and they
[1:06:38] look back into the past and ignore what
[1:06:40] he's doing right now, what he's trying
[1:06:41] to do right now. They might say, "Oh,
[1:06:43] he's just not preaching deep enough. He
[1:06:45] could just preach so much deeper. He
[1:06:47] could preach the seals. He could preach
[1:06:48] revelation. He could talk about the open
[1:06:50] book that was in his hand when that
[1:06:51] mighty angel descended." And the prophet
[1:06:53] said, "There won't be two of us standing
[1:06:55] here at the same time." We know that
[1:06:57] he's already here. Brothers and sisters,
[1:06:59] let's talk about Jesus in our lives.
[1:07:03] Let's talk about the deepest thing that
[1:07:04] we could ever talk about getting the
[1:07:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[1:07:08] literal life of Jesus Christ. The
[1:07:10] dynamic power of God coming upon the
[1:07:13] mechanics of the seed gene of God in the
[1:07:16] life of the believer.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; The thing of it is many of the people
[1:07:20] are trying to put these blessings off in
[1:07:22] the millennium somewhere. The Bible
[1:07:24] said, "Now you are the sons of God. Now
[1:07:27] you are the sons of God. When are we
[1:07:29] going to become the sons of God? When
[1:07:31] are we going to become the daughters of
[1:07:32] God? You either are or you're not.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And the word that we're trying to preach
[1:07:37] is that you are. And those people who
[1:07:39] are will be able to take that word and
[1:07:42] see that it's actually them. They're
[1:07:44] going to look in the mirror one day and
[1:07:46] they're going to say, "Hey, mama, that's
[1:07:47] me. I can see my reflection in that.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I recognize it now. You are the sons of
[1:07:54] God." Not, "You will be. You are right
[1:07:57] now."
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; The devil's going to say, "Nope. One day
[1:08:02] you have to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:05] One day you have to actually do
[1:08:07] something different. You have to maybe
[1:08:08] sing a special. Maybe you have to have
[1:08:11] gone to church 10,000 hours." They say
[1:08:15] that in in the world, I think they might
[1:08:17] have moved the goalpost now, but I
[1:08:19] remember reading a book a while ago and
[1:08:21] and the guy said in there that you have
[1:08:22] to do 10,000 hours of whatever it is you
[1:08:25] want to master. Whatever it is you want
[1:08:27] to master, you do 10,000 hours, you're a
[1:08:29] master of it. Maybe you need to have
[1:08:31] 10,000 hours of coming to church and
[1:08:33] grinding it out, of worshiping at the
[1:08:36] beginning and then listening as long as
[1:08:38] you possibly can without nodding off and
[1:08:40] then actually a couple songs while you
[1:08:42] wake up at the end and then you just go
[1:08:44] home. And I'm saying that because I've
[1:08:45] done it, brothers and sisters. I'm not
[1:08:47] saying because anybody is I don't think
[1:08:48] anybody's sleeping tonight. Praise the
[1:08:50] Lord.
[1:08:51] I I love what brother Toby said. Hey,
[1:08:53] you know what? It looks like people are
[1:08:55] are falling asleep here. How about we
[1:08:57] stand up and say shout praise the Lord.
[1:09:00] I I thought that was so good, Brother
[1:09:01] Toby. I'm going to use that sometime,
[1:09:03] but nobody's sleeping. Everyone's in
[1:09:05] tune tonight. God bless you. I know what
[1:09:07] it's like to come to church on a
[1:09:09] Wednesday night where you've got to
[1:09:10] fight your way across the city, where
[1:09:12] you've got to load the kids in the car,
[1:09:14] where everyone has to come home from
[1:09:15] school and work, and it's not easy to
[1:09:18] do. So, I'm not throwing off on people
[1:09:20] who do fall asleep because I know what
[1:09:22] it's like to come to church on a
[1:09:24] Wednesday night. And you know, one of
[1:09:26] the worst things that we have in our
[1:09:27] climate, the people from Arizona
[1:09:29] probably don't encounter this, is when
[1:09:31] you have to come to church on a
[1:09:32] Wednesday night and it's really cold
[1:09:34] out. And uh sometimes we have church
[1:09:37] when it's very cold outside and and
[1:09:40] maybe even like I I don't even know what
[1:09:42] the degrees would be in in uh
[1:09:44] Fahrenheit, but very cold. Very very
[1:09:46] cold. And and so you come out of the
[1:09:48] cold and you come into a building where
[1:09:50] it's warm and because we're cold, we
[1:09:52] don't want to take our jackets off. I'm
[1:09:54] just trying to be real and explain that
[1:09:56] this is a very real thing. And we come
[1:09:58] in and sit down in church and we start
[1:10:01] to engage in the service, but we're warm
[1:10:04] because we're in a warm building. We
[1:10:05] have our our warm jackets on and we're
[1:10:07] still trying to warm up and get that
[1:10:08] chill off. What happens is we start to
[1:10:10] get really warm and sleepy. It's a human
[1:10:13] trait. It's a human thing. But praise be
[1:10:16] the the the Lord God for giving us air
[1:10:19] conditioning here.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; We have AC to keep the the heat down a
[1:10:23] little bit. But you know, Brother Bam,
[1:10:25] he says, "People are trying to put these
[1:10:27] blessings off in the millennium
[1:10:28] somewhere." The Bible said, "Now you are
[1:10:29] the sons of God." Not you will be, you
[1:10:31] are. Right now, and I just highlighted
[1:10:33] this part. Right now, we are the sons of
[1:10:36] God. Right now, we are seated together
[1:10:39] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Not
[1:10:42] tomorrow. This night, tonight. Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, if I could
[1:10:47] encourage us, we are already seated in
[1:10:50] heavenly places
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Right now, if we have a
[1:10:57] need for anything, we are already seated
[1:11:00] in heavenly places. And this is really
[1:11:02] where I think the rubber meets the road.
[1:11:04] As Barry likes to say, I just love this
[1:11:07] part. He says, "When you can think now
[1:11:10] that you are sitting by a son of God or
[1:11:13] a daughter of God,
[1:11:16] I want to just pause there for a second.
[1:11:18] Take a look at your neighbor. Take a
[1:11:20] look at the person across from you.
[1:11:22] Brothers and sisters, you're looking at
[1:11:23] a son or a daughter of God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You're not looking at your brother. If
[1:11:30] you see your brother, then I want to
[1:11:33] just encourage you, maybe go pray a
[1:11:35] little bit
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; because we don't want to see each other
[1:11:38] after the flesh. We're not supposed to
[1:11:40] know any man after the flesh because
[1:11:43] this flesh will stagger.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And to think about how we can be
[1:11:48] misleading if we're just busy looking at
[1:11:50] the flesh. That's why, brothers and
[1:11:52] sisters, legalism failed.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Legalism is the path to hell. Legalism
[1:11:59] will take our children and push them
[1:12:01] right out the doors of the church.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; But if we can show them grace, grace,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; it's grace. That's the reason why we're
[1:12:11] here. Because as parents, we rely on the
[1:12:13] same grace that we bestow upon our
[1:12:16] children.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Because our heavenly father is so kind
[1:12:19] and loving.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; How could we be brutal dictator of
[1:12:24] legalism to our children? My but when
[1:12:27] you can think now that you are sitting
[1:12:30] by a son of God
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God. Think about it. If
[1:12:34] you were sitting beside President Trump
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; if you were sitting beside the the the
[1:12:40] president of France maybe the chancellor
[1:12:42] of Germany it would be like wow that's
[1:12:46] that person.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Oh can I shake their hand?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe even Carney. Maybe not so much
[1:12:54] with Trudeau but
[1:12:57] You know what I'm saying? A very
[1:12:58] important person. Even if it was
[1:12:59] Trudeau, it'd be like, man, that's the
[1:13:01] guy.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm sitting beside him. But
[1:13:05] tonight, we're seated in heavenly places
[1:13:07] beside sons and daughters of the most
[1:13:09] high God. And I think it's even further
[1:13:12] than that, brothers and sisters. We're
[1:13:13] sitting beside the queen of heaven.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; If we call ourselves the bride of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; think about those back in the day of
[1:13:22] Esther.
[1:13:24] Woo we
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; when all of that unfolded.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; And what happened?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hmon he devised he created a device and
[1:13:37] thought that he was going to forecast it
[1:13:39] to the Jews.
[1:13:42] The king said to the queen, "You say the
[1:13:44] word.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You have the authority.
[1:13:49] I'm not going to change my word, but you
[1:13:52] speak the word
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and I'll back it up.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Take my signant and you make it happen.
[1:13:58] And what happened? That enemy was hung
[1:14:01] by his own gallows. And I just love it
[1:14:04] because that's exactly what happens to
[1:14:06] the devil when he comes around and tries
[1:14:07] to trip us up. He winds up being
[1:14:10] punished with his own device. If we are
[1:14:12] willing to just simply take him at his
[1:14:14] word and stagger not at the promise of
[1:14:16] God through unbelief, but be strong in
[1:14:19] faith, knowing that we're Abraham's
[1:14:21] spiritual seed.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; But when you can think now that you are
[1:14:25] sitting beside a son or daughter of God,
[1:14:28] and you are the same as they are, and
[1:14:31] Christ Jesus is tabernacled in you here
[1:14:34] on earth, showing his great
[1:14:35] manifestations of his blessings and
[1:14:37] power. Now many times people would say
[1:14:39] well I don't have many manifestations
[1:14:42] blessings and power. Do you believe this
[1:14:44] word?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; If you believe this word then you are a
[1:14:48] living manifestation of his power
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; because not everyone can believe this
[1:14:53] word. You go and talk about this word
[1:14:55] this word to people in this world and
[1:14:58] they will scoff at you. they'll start to
[1:15:00] get all technical and say, "Well, what
[1:15:02] really happened in the Garden of Eden?"
[1:15:03] And this guy in his testimony, you know,
[1:15:05] the first two polls, we heard about it
[1:15:07] on Sunday, the first and second polls
[1:15:08] were tremendous, but oh my, start
[1:15:10] talking about the opening of the word
[1:15:12] and Malachi 4:5 and 6 and and
[1:15:14] Revelations 10:7. Oh my, this guy went
[1:15:17] off on his doctrine. That's what they're
[1:15:19] going to say. But for some reason, we
[1:15:21] have the ability to believe this. Why is
[1:15:23] that?
[1:15:24] That is alone the greatest manifestation
[1:15:28] of his power to this age, brothers and
[1:15:30] sisters, because that shows the definite
[1:15:33] identification of the baptism of the
[1:15:35] Holy Spirit.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has tabernacled you here on
[1:15:39] earth, showing his great manifestations
[1:15:40] of his blessings and power, willing that
[1:15:43] everyone should be saved, everyone
[1:15:45] should be healed, none should perish. I
[1:15:49] tell you, if you could really fathom
[1:15:52] that in your mind, I tell you now, who's
[1:15:54] speaking here, the Holy Ghost or the
[1:15:56] prophet? Who's speaking here? Brother
[1:15:58] Barry, I tell you, if you could really
[1:16:01] fathom that in your mind, I tell you,
[1:16:03] you wouldn't have to have any prayer for
[1:16:06] the sick,
[1:16:08] it' just be all over.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Bradom, he says it
[1:16:13] I I I just love it. back in the church
[1:16:15] age book. He said, "You know, if we just
[1:16:16] caught that revelation, if we really did
[1:16:18] catch the revelation, we would just take
[1:16:20] him at his word. We would come to the
[1:16:21] front. We'd call the elders. We'd be
[1:16:23] anointed with oil." And what that would
[1:16:25] be that
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; exactly what he's saying here. That
[1:16:28] would be that. There would be no need
[1:16:30] for a prayer line or prayer meeting or
[1:16:33] any of it. He says it'll be all over.
[1:16:38] But you have to see it first.
[1:16:41] If you can't see it, you certainly can't
[1:16:44] understand it.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And I just want to try and encourage us
[1:16:48] to see it tonight, brothers and sisters.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do is try and
[1:16:51] encourage us to see it. To see these
[1:16:53] blessings and manifestations of God's
[1:16:55] power in our life to recognize that this
[1:16:58] covenant isn't just for Abraham. It's
[1:17:00] not for Abram. It's not for William,
[1:17:02] Mary, and Brandham. It's not for the
[1:17:04] great ministry that might be in the
[1:17:05] world now, the five-fold ministry. It's
[1:17:07] for the sons and daughters of God. is
[1:17:10] for his bride, universal. That's what
[1:17:13] this unconditional covenant is for. And
[1:17:17] I just think it's beautiful because when
[1:17:18] we look at the word covenant, we can see
[1:17:21] that it is used in the Bible many times.
[1:17:24] I looked it up and it's 280 times in the
[1:17:27] Bible, the word covenant. and
[1:17:30] specifically in the book of Genesis 23
[1:17:32] times. I believe it's 23 verses and
[1:17:36] maybe even a couple more times by
[1:17:39] multiple uses in different verses.
[1:17:43] But the word covenant, I looked it up,
[1:17:44] is H1285
[1:17:47] in the uh concordance and it's from 1262
[1:17:51] in the sense of cutting like 1254, a
[1:17:55] compact
[1:17:57] because made by passing between pieces
[1:18:00] of flesh,
[1:18:02] confederacy, confederate, covenant,
[1:18:05] league, a covenant. I think it's amazing
[1:18:09] when we look at this because if we turn
[1:18:11] back over in our Bibles to the book of
[1:18:14] Genesis,
[1:18:18] Genesis
[1:18:21] chapter 15,
[1:18:24] this
[1:18:25] chapter in the book of Genesis in my
[1:18:28] Bible, it says covenant with Abram.
[1:18:32] Even before he had his name changed, God
[1:18:34] was dealing with him. But we know uh
[1:18:41] I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:18:42] start with
[1:18:44] verse 8 of Genesis chapter 15 just for
[1:18:48] the sake of time.
[1:18:50] Actually, let's just go back and read
[1:18:52] from verse one. We still have time.
[1:18:56] Start with verse one of chapter 15.
[1:18:59] Sorry.
[1:19:01] After these things, the word of the Lord
[1:19:02] came unto Abram in a vision, saying,
[1:19:04] "Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield and
[1:19:07] thy exceeding great reward. And Abram
[1:19:10] said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me,
[1:19:14] seeing I go childless, and the steward
[1:19:17] of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus?
[1:19:21] And Abram said, Behold, to me, thou hast
[1:19:24] given no seed. And lo, one born in my
[1:19:28] house is mine heir. And behold, the word
[1:19:32] of the Lord came unto him, saying, This
[1:19:35] shall not be thine heir, but he that
[1:19:38] shall come forth out of thine bowels
[1:19:41] shall be thine heir.
[1:19:44] And he brought him forth abroad, and
[1:19:47] said, Look now toward heaven, and tell
[1:19:50] the stars, if thou be able to number
[1:19:53] them. And he said unto him, "So shall
[1:19:57] thy seed be." And he believed in the
[1:20:01] Lord.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And he counted it to him for
[1:20:05] righteousness.
[1:20:08] And he said unto him, I am the Lord that
[1:20:10] brought thee out of
[1:20:12] the Chaldas to give thee this land to
[1:20:16] inherit it.
[1:20:18] And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I
[1:20:21] know that I shall inherit it? And he
[1:20:24] said unto him, "Take me a heer of three
[1:20:26] years old, and a shegoat of three years
[1:20:28] old, and a ram of three years old, and a
[1:20:31] turtle dove, and a young pigeon." And he
[1:20:35] took unto him all these, and divided
[1:20:37] them in the midst, and laid each piece,
[1:20:40] one against another.
[1:20:43] But the birds he divided divided he not.
[1:20:47] And when the fowls came down upon the
[1:20:49] carcasses, Abram drove them away.
[1:20:53] And when the sun was going down, a deep
[1:20:57] sleep fell upon Abram, and lo, and
[1:21:00] horror of great darkness fell upon him.
[1:21:04] And he said unto Abram, "Know of
[1:21:08] assurityity that thy seed shall be a
[1:21:11] stranger in a land that is not theirs,
[1:21:14] and shall serve them, and they shall
[1:21:17] afflict them 400 years.
[1:21:22] And also that nation whom they shall
[1:21:25] serve will I judge, and afterward shall
[1:21:28] they come out with great substance,
[1:21:32] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[1:21:35] peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good
[1:21:38] old age.
[1:21:40] But in the fourth generation they shall
[1:21:42] come hither again, for the iniquity of
[1:21:44] the Amorites is not yet full. And it
[1:21:48] came to pass that when the sun went down
[1:21:51] and it was dark, behold, a smoking
[1:21:54] furnace and a burning lamp that passed
[1:21:57] between those pieces. In the same day
[1:22:01] the Lord made a covenant with Abram,
[1:22:03] saying, "Unto thy seed have I given this
[1:22:06] land, from the river of Egypt, unto the
[1:22:10] great river, the river Euphrates, the
[1:22:13] Canaanites, the Kennesites, the Komites,
[1:22:17] and the Hittites, and the Parizzites,
[1:22:19] and the Refins,
[1:22:23] sorry, and the Amorites, and the
[1:22:24] Canaanites, and the Gegosites, and the
[1:22:28] Jebusites.
[1:22:29] He gave all of that land to them. And we
[1:22:33] know we've read this so many times. I
[1:22:36] think it's beautiful, brother Brandham.
[1:22:37] In this message, if you listen to it,
[1:22:41] the uh the quote that we just read, the
[1:22:45] unconditional covenant that God made
[1:22:46] with the people, Brother Brandham says
[1:22:48] in here really, really well, just makes
[1:22:51] it so clear. He talks about that burning
[1:22:54] furnace and that lamp that passed
[1:22:57] between the flesh. What that is is a
[1:23:01] vision of Calvary of the light that
[1:23:04] passes between the flesh and the animals
[1:23:07] being torn apart and laid in order in
[1:23:11] array is actually a type of that flesh
[1:23:14] being torn apart at Calvary. And we know
[1:23:18] that covenant was made with Abraham,
[1:23:20] with Abram. And it had to come to pass
[1:23:23] exactly according to the word of God.
[1:23:25] And it's just so beautiful to think that
[1:23:27] this covenant was given to Abram for his
[1:23:30] seed to inherit the land. And we know
[1:23:35] we've talked about this many, many times
[1:23:37] about the children of Israel coming out
[1:23:38] of bondage. It talks about it in here
[1:23:40] how the prophecy they would be in
[1:23:43] bondage in a strange land 400 years. his
[1:23:46] seed would be. But we know that they
[1:23:48] were sent to deliver because they began
[1:23:50] to cry out. We've talked about all of
[1:23:52] this, but they were called out to go
[1:23:54] into a promised land. That promised land
[1:23:57] is mentioned here. And we know exactly
[1:23:59] what the dimensions of the land are, the
[1:24:01] geographical location of it as well, and
[1:24:03] who the inhabitants of that land really
[1:24:05] are. And I just think it's amazing when
[1:24:08] we look at this because we can see this
[1:24:09] covenant isn't just for Abraham and his
[1:24:12] natural seed. Tonight, I want to remind
[1:24:15] us that this covenant is for Abraham's
[1:24:18] spiritual seed, the royal seed of
[1:24:22] Abraham. And it's not to go and inhabit
[1:24:24] a land where there's all kinds of
[1:24:26] iszites in the land. It's to inhabit the
[1:24:29] spiritual land that God has given us,
[1:24:31] his promised land for our age, which is
[1:24:34] truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:37] That is our promised land for this day.
[1:24:40] And I can't help but think every time we
[1:24:42] read in here how many types of enemies
[1:24:45] there there, there's just as many or
[1:24:47] more types of enemies in our promised
[1:24:50] land, the devil trying to keep us from
[1:24:52] getting through to our rest. We know
[1:24:55] that there's a rest promise for us. But
[1:24:58] talking about the covenant in in
[1:24:59] Genesis, just specifically in Genesis, I
[1:25:02] believe there's so much that we could
[1:25:03] talk about with this covenant. I don't
[1:25:05] know if we'll uh we'll be able to even
[1:25:07] cover it all tonight. But Noah, we know
[1:25:10] Noah, he was given a covenant. He was
[1:25:12] given a token of a covenant in the day
[1:25:15] in which he lived. And we know that it
[1:25:17] was first, it was God's word. He told
[1:25:19] him to build an ark because it's going
[1:25:20] to rain. And we know that nobody
[1:25:22] believed because there was no rain in
[1:25:24] the world at the time. But Noah, he
[1:25:27] followed the word of the Lord and he
[1:25:28] actually built the ark. And the ark, I
[1:25:31] can't help but think, was a
[1:25:33] manifestation of God's blessing in his
[1:25:36] day. That was actually man following the
[1:25:40] word of God in his heart. And what did
[1:25:43] he do? He created the ark as God
[1:25:46] instructed him. And that ark is what
[1:25:49] took him through the destruction. That
[1:25:52] ark is what took him through the
[1:25:54] judgment of his day. And after the
[1:25:57] judgment had passed, God gave him a
[1:26:01] covenant. He gave him that token. And he
[1:26:03] said, "I'll put this bow in the sky.
[1:26:05] You'll see it every time it rains and it
[1:26:07] will be a reminder to you and to me that
[1:26:10] I will never again take all the flesh
[1:26:13] off of the earth by a flood. That will
[1:26:16] never happen again. And we know today we
[1:26:18] still see that in the sky when we see a
[1:26:20] good rain shower and the sun hits it
[1:26:22] just right. We can all say, "Oh, there's
[1:26:25] a rainbow." And I think it's beautiful
[1:26:27] because in the believer's life, there's
[1:26:28] just something special about it. We
[1:26:30] recognize that's exactly where it came
[1:26:32] from. That is a sign from God to his
[1:26:35] people that he will never again destroy
[1:26:38] the world with a flood.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; But we know today
[1:26:42] that token, that covenant was taken and
[1:26:46] they've tried to pervert it, but we know
[1:26:47] they're one color off. And they'll never
[1:26:50] be able to take that token and pervert
[1:26:51] it because it's in the sky. It's not on
[1:26:53] a flag or a badge or a pin or a sticker
[1:26:56] on a a a a store or whatever. they'll
[1:26:59] never be able to take it and pervert it
[1:27:02] the way that they would like to. But we
[1:27:04] know that that was one type of a a
[1:27:06] token. And you know, the token of the
[1:27:08] covenant for us in our day, we we know
[1:27:10] full well, brother Bradom preached, the
[1:27:12] message, the token. And the token we
[1:27:15] know is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:18] It is the seal of God in our lives. It's
[1:27:20] the seal over the womb in our lives, in
[1:27:24] our souls, where we are sealed until the
[1:27:27] day of our redemption. And that's where
[1:27:29] I want to remind us tonight, brothers
[1:27:30] and sisters, of this unconditional
[1:27:32] covenant that we have been given, being
[1:27:34] the heirs of the promise that we have
[1:27:37] read about in the scripture tonight.
[1:27:39] Abraham's royal seed, the ones through
[1:27:42] many, many generations down the road.
[1:27:44] Remember Abraham, Abram, he was not
[1:27:48] actually Hebrew. Do we know that?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; He was not Hebrew.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; He was a gentile.
[1:27:55] And it's interesting because the
[1:27:57] blessing went from Gentile to Jew, now
[1:28:01] back to Gentile.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And we know that it's on its way back to
[1:28:04] the Jew again. Any moment now, it's
[1:28:07] going to head right back there. But the
[1:28:08] token of the covenant in our day is
[1:28:11] truly the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:28:13] when we get that in our lives, you are
[1:28:15] sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:28:16] It's not when you go to a service and
[1:28:18] you have a great service and you feel
[1:28:20] good. You're you're sealed with the
[1:28:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It is now and
[1:28:24] forever. And and I think it's beautiful
[1:28:26] because even if we wanted to, brothers
[1:28:28] and sisters, I I could be challenged on
[1:28:30] this and certainly we could talk about
[1:28:32] it, but I would believe this with all my
[1:28:34] heart because the word of God says that
[1:28:35] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:28:37] redemption. If we ever get the baptism
[1:28:38] of the Holy Ghost, we can try and get
[1:28:40] rid of it, but we'll never be able to
[1:28:42] because we're sealed till the day of our
[1:28:44] redemption. But I know one thing is full
[1:28:46] well. I'll back it up with this. If we
[1:28:48] truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:28:50] we'll never want to get rid of it. will
[1:28:52] never want to get rid of it. And I love
[1:28:54] how Brother Brandham says it in this
[1:28:55] message here. You know, sometimes people
[1:28:57] will say, "I've got the liberty of of of
[1:29:00] God in my life. I'm a believer. I'm a
[1:29:02] Christian. I can do whatever I want to
[1:29:04] do. I can maybe have a little drink. I
[1:29:06] could have maybe a little smoke. I could
[1:29:08] go to a little rock and roll. I could do
[1:29:10] all these things and still be a
[1:29:12] Christian just like you." Brother Bradam
[1:29:14] says, "Sure enough, you could, but you
[1:29:17] wouldn't want to."
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; If you're truly a Christian, if you're
[1:29:22] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost, you
[1:29:23] wouldn't want to do those things.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; We can easily take grace and turn it
[1:29:32] into a disgrace if we don't have the
[1:29:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that's
[1:29:36] the differentiating factor.
[1:29:39] We know uh how important it is, I hope
[1:29:41] we do, to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:43] Ghost. It's so important. Brother
[1:29:44] Brandham says you're lost as lost can be
[1:29:47] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:49] You will not go in the rapture without
[1:29:51] the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Without the seal of God in your life,
[1:29:54] you will not make the rapture.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; You're lost as lost can be. And we're
[1:29:58] here tonight, brothers and sisters, to
[1:30:00] remind us that is our covenant. That is
[1:30:03] what we're after. That is the holy
[1:30:05] grail. That is the pearl of great price
[1:30:08] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:30:10] lives.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; You know, talking about this token,
[1:30:13] brother Brandham preaches the token. And
[1:30:15] what entitles us to the token, brothers
[1:30:16] and sisters? Church attendance, the way
[1:30:19] we cut our hair, our our rims on our
[1:30:22] car, how shiny they are, the way we
[1:30:25] dress,
[1:30:27] our homes, our bank accounts, our
[1:30:29] portfolios, our churches, our pastors.
[1:30:33] What is it?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Obedience. Full obedience,
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; full obedience
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; to the complete word of God,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; entitles us to the token.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And the devil can't stop us when we're
[1:30:47] willing to do that. And you know,
[1:30:48] brothers and sisters, that doesn't mean
[1:30:50] that we have to understand the whole
[1:30:52] word of God. It doesn't mean that we
[1:30:54] have to understand the whole entire
[1:30:56] message of the hour. All it means is
[1:30:59] that we have to be willing to say just
[1:31:01] like Mary said, "Be it unto me according
[1:31:04] to thy word." That's all we have to do.
[1:31:08] And that will entitle us to the token.
[1:31:10] And I can't I just think it's so
[1:31:12] beautiful because of the way he does it.
[1:31:14] When we do that, if we're willing to be
[1:31:16] genuine and sincere that way, maybe as a
[1:31:18] young person, maybe as an old person who
[1:31:20] has never experienced it, however it is,
[1:31:22] when we're willing to be that sincere,
[1:31:24] God is willing to come into our lives
[1:31:27] and begin to reveal these things to us.
[1:31:30] He will take this book and make it a new
[1:31:31] book, the Bible I'm talking about. He
[1:31:34] will take the message and make it
[1:31:36] understandable to us. We'll listen to a
[1:31:38] message and think, "I've listened to
[1:31:40] that message four or five times before,
[1:31:42] but I never really ever understood it
[1:31:45] the way I do now. That's the way it is.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve."
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Brandham brings the
[1:31:52] message uh uh in the message, he he
[1:31:54] brings the note. He says, "You know,
[1:31:56] back in the day, the Chinese laundry,
[1:31:58] they had tokens or or pages, right? They
[1:32:01] they couldn't speak English, so they
[1:32:02] could write down maybe two shirts and
[1:32:04] one pants." And and what they would do
[1:32:06] when you drop your stuff off, they would
[1:32:08] take it and they would tear it and they
[1:32:10] would keep one half with the clothes and
[1:32:12] they would give the other half to the
[1:32:14] customer. And the only way you would get
[1:32:16] your laundry back is if you had the
[1:32:19] other half of the piece of paper.
[1:32:21] Because sometimes people would come in,
[1:32:23] charlatans maybe, and say, "Oh, those
[1:32:26] are my clothes up there. I forgot my
[1:32:28] ticket." And and you know how do I know
[1:32:30] this, brothers and sisters? I used to
[1:32:31] work at a shoe repair. People did it all
[1:32:33] the time. Nobody cared about their
[1:32:35] ticket. So they would come back and say,
[1:32:37] "Those are my shoes up there." And so
[1:32:39] you'd be forced with a dilemma. You know
[1:32:40] what? Those are $400 pair of Allen Edund
[1:32:43] shoes that had a complete rebuild
[1:32:45] underneath. Brand new souls and heels.
[1:32:48] That's $75 worth of work. And I don't
[1:32:51] think you look like the guy that brought
[1:32:52] those shoes in.
[1:32:54] So now if I give you those shoes, I
[1:32:57] could have the guy that brought those
[1:32:58] shoes in come back and actually say,
[1:33:00] "Where's my shoes? Here's my ticket."
[1:33:02] So, we started to say it. I understand
[1:33:05] this means a lot to me. Where's your
[1:33:07] ticket? If you don't have your ticket,
[1:33:08] you're not going to get your shoes back.
[1:33:10] So, make sure you don't lose that
[1:33:11] ticket. Understand? And and sometimes it
[1:33:14] upset people, but it saved us from a
[1:33:16] whole lot of hot water, a whole bunch of
[1:33:18] trouble. And I just can't help but think
[1:33:19] it's exactly the way Brother Brandham
[1:33:22] brings it in the message. He talks about
[1:33:24] it, how it has to be an exact match. And
[1:33:27] it's just exactly out of Genesis chapter
[1:33:30] 15. God who himself came down and was
[1:33:35] torn. He will only match up with
[1:33:39] himself. That's all. If we don't have
[1:33:42] the other half of the ticket that
[1:33:44] Brother Brandham was talking about,
[1:33:45] which is the spirit of Christ inside of
[1:33:48] us, we're not going to be a match.
[1:33:51] Brother Brandham says, "I believe there
[1:33:54] could be a spirit there."
[1:33:56] And you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:33:57] we're going to have a spirit. Whether we
[1:33:59] want to admit it or not, whether we
[1:34:01] understand it or not, it doesn't matter.
[1:34:02] It's just like the literal law of
[1:34:04] gravity. Take a ball and drop it and say
[1:34:07] to me that there's no gravity. Why does
[1:34:09] it fall? It's going to fall. Right? Just
[1:34:13] like that, there is a spirit realm. And
[1:34:15] we're either going to have the Holy
[1:34:17] Spirit in our life or we're going to
[1:34:18] have another spirit in our life. Brother
[1:34:21] Brandham calls it the unholy spirit in
[1:34:24] some places. And we can have another
[1:34:26] spirit influencing our life. And I want
[1:34:28] to say this, brothers and sisters, loud
[1:34:30] and clear. I want to be really crisp
[1:34:32] with it. The worst kind of spirit that
[1:34:34] we could ever have bothering us in our
[1:34:37] lives is a religious spirit. One that
[1:34:40] will come and sit down at the preaching
[1:34:42] in a message church saying, "I believe
[1:34:45] that God sent a prophet, but I don't
[1:34:46] like that guy's preaching. I just don't
[1:34:48] like the way he harps about the Holy
[1:34:50] Ghost." When we get into that sort of
[1:34:52] thing, I'll tell you what, that is not
[1:34:53] the Holy Spirit because that Holy Spirit
[1:34:56] is always going to say amen to that
[1:34:58] word. It's going to be the other half of
[1:35:01] that ticket.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; We're going to have an influence one way
[1:35:06] or another. We're going to serve
[1:35:09] God or we're going to serve Mammon.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And there's no way around that. That's
[1:35:14] the way that God set things in order.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is.
[1:35:19] But you know, there's a natural seed
[1:35:22] that's spoke about in Genesis and and
[1:35:25] that's Ishmamail. We can talk about
[1:35:27] that. But I I want to say it this way.
[1:35:29] You know, we can look at it and say
[1:35:32] there is a a natural seed called
[1:35:34] Ishmamail. And there is
[1:35:38] we know that it was clearly labeled in
[1:35:40] the Bible that that that one will go
[1:35:43] forward and actually be a great nation
[1:35:47] with many people and he'll be a wild
[1:35:50] man.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And you can look around in the world and
[1:35:52] you can see the seed of Ishmael.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to say that. That's
[1:35:56] all I'm going to say.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; But you know,
[1:36:00] he's a product of man's way.
[1:36:03] The natural seed
[1:36:05] is man's way.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The natural seed is going to say, "I can
[1:36:09] I can just do it this way. I can serve
[1:36:11] God this way.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I can just hybridize my traditions with
[1:36:16] the message of the hour.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I can just say, you know, it's worked
[1:36:20] for me and my family all these years and
[1:36:23] and everything is good in our lives. We
[1:36:24] can just do it this way." Even when the
[1:36:26] word of God says do it that way. Even
[1:36:29] when the messenger to this age says do
[1:36:31] it that way. We can say well you know
[1:36:33] other people are doing it the other way.
[1:36:37] There is a natural seed and the
[1:36:41] spiritual royal seed of Abram Abraham
[1:36:45] will never deviate from the word of God.
[1:36:47] They will always line up with the word
[1:36:49] of God.
[1:36:50] I just can't help but think looking at
[1:36:52] this natural seed from
[1:36:56] Abraham, Abram and his wife at the time
[1:37:01] produced an Ishmamail. We don't want to
[1:37:03] produce an ishmill in our lives,
[1:37:05] brothers and sisters. That's man's way.
[1:37:07] And and it's interesting because when we
[1:37:09] look at it, there's a scriptural sort of
[1:37:12] identification to it. And that's, you
[1:37:14] know, Romans chapter 7. And and you
[1:37:16] know, we've talked about it in in Romans
[1:37:18] chapter 7 many times. I think maybe just
[1:37:21] for the the sake of it, if we don't
[1:37:23] mind, we could just turn over there to
[1:37:25] Romans chapter 7.
[1:37:30] Romans chapter 7.
[1:37:36] We'll just read verse 22. For I delight
[1:37:38] in the law of God after the inward man.
[1:37:42] I want to do good, but evil is present.
[1:37:45] That's earlier in the chapter. I every
[1:37:47] time I want to do good, evil is present.
[1:37:49] Oh my, I I delight in the law of God
[1:37:52] after the inward man, but I see another
[1:37:55] law in my members, waring against the
[1:37:57] law of my mind and bringing me into
[1:38:00] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:38:02] my members. Oh wretched man that I am,
[1:38:05] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:38:08] this death?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I thank God through Jesus Christ our
[1:38:11] Lord. So then with my mind, with the
[1:38:15] mind I serve the law of God, but with
[1:38:18] the flesh, the law of sin.
[1:38:21] That is Ishmael's
[1:38:24] seed. That is the natural seed, brothers
[1:38:27] and sisters, that I want to get to
[1:38:28] tonight. That is what we encounter if we
[1:38:31] are living that way. But we've said it
[1:38:34] over and over again, and I'll say it
[1:38:35] again tonight. Just turn the page.
[1:38:38] Don't stay in Romans chapter 7 because
[1:38:40] those are not the ones that recognize
[1:38:43] their position under this covenant of
[1:38:46] the royal seed. Turn the page the first
[1:38:49] verse. There is therefore when
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; right now no condemnation to those who
[1:38:55] are in Christ Jesus.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Now we're talking about the spiritual
[1:39:00] seed. In the last five minutes, there is
[1:39:03] a spiritual seed that is Ephesians
[1:39:06] chapter 1, predestinated.
[1:39:09] They're predestined to be sons of God.
[1:39:12] Ephesians 1, predestined to be adopted
[1:39:16] sons of God. Not just sons of God, but
[1:39:18] adopted sons of God. Taken to the full
[1:39:21] place of maturity, revealed unto men to
[1:39:24] say, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye
[1:39:27] him. Look at him." He is actually living
[1:39:30] out the modernday manifestation of my
[1:39:34] spirit to the world in which he's living
[1:39:36] in predestined. There is therefore now
[1:39:39] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:39:41] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:39:43] what?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; The flesh. Don't look at the flesh. Love
[1:39:48] that song. Don't look at me or you. Keep
[1:39:52] your eyes on things above.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; He's the lovely one. Where is he coming
[1:39:56] into plain view, brothers and sisters,
[1:39:58] by the way? Where does he come into
[1:39:59] plain view? Is it in a church building?
[1:40:02] Is it through the lattice work according
[1:40:04] to that psalm? Is it just in a story
[1:40:06] book somewhere? He comes into plain view
[1:40:08] in you.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; He comes into plain view in me.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And how does that show? How does that
[1:40:15] manifest? Full obedience to the complete
[1:40:17] word of God.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Reveals Jesus Christ himself.
[1:40:23] Christ, the mystery of God revealed in
[1:40:26] you.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; That spiritual seed is predestined.
[1:40:33] And you know, brothers and sisters, it's
[1:40:35] an everlasting covenant.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just a covenant. It's an
[1:40:39] everlasting covenant. It's a covenant
[1:40:41] that's from now until
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; until. And you know, I just think the
[1:40:48] beautiful thing is the disciples when
[1:40:51] Jesus
[1:40:52] came and saw them again after his
[1:40:54] resurrection, he told them, "Follow my
[1:40:57] instructions and go back to Jerusalem
[1:40:59] and tar there until you receive power on
[1:41:03] high." Brother Brandham says it so many
[1:41:06] times in the message of the hour. We
[1:41:08] need to tar until
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; until.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; How long, brothers and sisters? one day,
[1:41:15] two days, 10 days, a week, a month, a
[1:41:19] year until until you receive power from
[1:41:24] on high. And that's not power where we
[1:41:26] can produce mighty signs and wonders.
[1:41:28] No, no. It's where we can recognize that
[1:41:30] that other half of the ticket matches up
[1:41:33] with my life. My life matches that
[1:41:36] ticket perfectly and I can say, "Praise
[1:41:38] the Lord." because I know that he has
[1:41:40] called me as his royal seed in the day
[1:41:43] in which we live. That everlasting
[1:41:46] covenant is not for someone else. That's
[1:41:48] for me. Remember what we said tonight,
[1:41:50] brother Brandham, in this quote, he
[1:41:52] said, "You're just scared to take God at
[1:41:53] his word." Don't be afraid, brothers and
[1:41:55] sisters, to take God at his word.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I I want to challenge us tonight. I want
[1:41:59] to challenge myself tonight to say,
[1:42:02] maybe I can just take God a little
[1:42:03] further at his word than I ever have
[1:42:05] before. Maybe I can actually stand in
[1:42:08] the face of Satan and say, "Yeah, I want
[1:42:10] to actually take a step of boldness and
[1:42:12] do something maybe just a little bit
[1:42:13] different than I have done according to
[1:42:15] the word of God." Never outside of the
[1:42:17] word of God, but another step towards
[1:42:20] this covenant for me in my life, for me
[1:42:22] in my family, for me in my church. I
[1:42:25] don't want to be afraid. I don't want to
[1:42:26] be scared to take God at his word. Even
[1:42:28] if we find ourselves in the midst of a
[1:42:31] storm, in the midst of a train wreck in
[1:42:32] our lives, don't be afraid to take him
[1:42:35] at his word. Brothers and sisters, that
[1:42:37] is the where he is the master. He's the
[1:42:39] master of the wind. He can come into the
[1:42:42] midst of any storm. That's where he
[1:42:44] wants us to be in the middle of the
[1:42:45] storm. That's where he wanted his
[1:42:47] disciples to be was in the middle of the
[1:42:49] storm. And he walked right out to them.
[1:42:52] And when he got there, what happened?
[1:42:53] They were afraid that he was a spirit.
[1:42:55] Remember?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; But when they recognized who it was, oh
[1:42:59] my, everything changed, didn't it? Let's
[1:43:02] not be scared to take him at his word.
[1:43:04] Let's recognize who we are. He said,
[1:43:06] "You don't know who you are. Because you
[1:43:08] don't know who you are, you become
[1:43:10] afraid." I just want to encourage us to
[1:43:13] remember who we are. Sons and daughters
[1:43:16] of the most high God. Look around at our
[1:43:18] brothers and sisters. The ones we're
[1:43:20] sitting next to, remember they're sons
[1:43:22] and daughters of God. Oh my. And and you
[1:43:25] know, right now, brothers and sisters,
[1:43:28] we're seated together in heavenly
[1:43:29] places. We're not going to be. Let's not
[1:43:32] put it off into the millennium. That's
[1:43:34] what we heard tonight. I'll call the
[1:43:35] musicians. As we close, let's let's
[1:43:38] realize it's right now that we are the
[1:43:41] sons of God seated right there in
[1:43:44] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; And you know, I just think that we have
[1:43:50] the ability to to maybe see some some
[1:43:53] more of Jesus in our lives. In in this
[1:43:56] message, Brother Brandham, he talks
[1:43:58] about this and it's one of the things he
[1:43:59] just says in passing talking about how
[1:44:01] people when they believe and when they
[1:44:03] don't believe. And and he talks about
[1:44:05] Satan's unbelief.
[1:44:08] I just it just really struck me when I
[1:44:10] was studying this Satan's unbelief
[1:44:13] because isn't that true? Unbelief is
[1:44:16] Satan's.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Let's give it the the designation for
[1:44:20] the ownership of that. If there's any
[1:44:22] unbelief in this world, it's Satan's.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; It's not any human beings ever. It's
[1:44:27] only Satan's. Let's put it back on the
[1:44:30] rightful owner. But you know, if there
[1:44:32] is belief, it's someone else's.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; To be able to believe
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; is of God.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; It is God.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; That's why the theme song for the
[1:44:43] prophet of this age was only believe.
[1:44:46] not only understand or only explain or
[1:44:50] only live or only whatever it was only
[1:44:53] believe.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; All things are possible
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; if we can just believe.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Don't be looking at it and getting
[1:45:01] scared. Brothers and sisters, you know,
[1:45:02] I I just can't help but think maybe as
[1:45:04] we close, if you stand with me, I'll
[1:45:06] just throw this one thing out there that
[1:45:08] just was resounding with me. You know,
[1:45:10] brother Brandham, he he actually saw
[1:45:13] these deer in the woods the one time and
[1:45:17] he actually was in a position where he
[1:45:20] had just come through speaking to the
[1:45:22] storm and God was real close to him and
[1:45:26] really really affected him that day and
[1:45:29] he saw these deer and he had this
[1:45:32] conversation with them and and he said,
[1:45:34] "You know, I could take your life. I
[1:45:36] could lift up my 270 rifle and put a
[1:45:39] bullet through your heart. Split your
[1:45:41] heart and you would die.
[1:45:43] But he didn't. He said, "I give you
[1:45:45] life.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I I want you to live. So go." And he
[1:45:50] said they just didn't want to leave.
[1:45:51] They wanted to stand and look at him.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; But we know that God came and said
[1:45:55] something to him.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I remember my promise.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Do you remember yours? Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think
[1:46:05] sometimes, brothers and sisters, our our
[1:46:07] very Christian walk can sometimes just
[1:46:10] grow a little bit cold. Maybe we get our
[1:46:12] eagle eyes filmed over. Maybe we find
[1:46:15] that we've made mistakes in our lives.
[1:46:18] Let's just pick up the pieces and go
[1:46:20] forwards. Let's just get up and go
[1:46:23] forwards and remember that this is an
[1:46:25] unconditional covenant. And though Satan
[1:46:27] would try and say to us, "Hey, you know
[1:46:29] what? You've sent away your day of
[1:46:30] grace." You can turn around and say,
[1:46:32] "No, no. I've accepted this
[1:46:33] unconditional covenant the day that I
[1:46:36] believed the full word of God. I
[1:46:38] accepted the complete word of God. I
[1:46:41] took it into my heart and I accepted it
[1:46:43] the way that he gave it to me." And that
[1:46:44] entitled me to the token. So, I know
[1:46:46] that I've got the token or I've got the
[1:46:48] earnest of the token in my life. Either
[1:46:51] way, Satan can't touch us.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us, brothers
[1:46:56] and sisters, remember your covenant with
[1:46:58] him. And if you haven't got one, if
[1:47:00] you've never made one, it's not too
[1:47:02] late. He's still calling. Any one of
[1:47:04] these days though, we heard about it on
[1:47:06] Sunday. Any one of these days, someone's
[1:47:09] going to get sloppy with a button and
[1:47:11] something's going to happen. We heard
[1:47:14] about it this week. There was this one
[1:47:15] of the strongest earthquakes ever to be
[1:47:18] recorded. Just this week
[1:47:21] on one side of the ocean. One of these
[1:47:23] days, it's going to be on this side of
[1:47:24] the ocean. Remember
[1:47:27] your covenant
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; and he'll remember his.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; It's an unconditional, everlasting
[1:47:33] covenant. Brothers and sisters, God
[1:47:34] bless you tonight. Let's pray. Gracious
[1:47:37] Lord Jesus, thank you for your word.
[1:47:39] Thank you for your
[1:47:41] unfailing love to us, Lord. Thank you
[1:47:44] for your unconditional covenant to us.
[1:47:48] There's so many covenants in this world
[1:47:49] that are conditional, Lord. But you gave
[1:47:52] us one that's absolutely free and clear
[1:47:55] of every single condition.
[1:47:58] when you came as a burning lamp yourself
[1:48:02] Elohim, that pillar of fire and you
[1:48:04] passed between the literal flesh of your
[1:48:07] son as as he died on the cross. Father,
[1:48:11] what a blessing it is for us to be
[1:48:14] recipients of that covenant, Lord, to
[1:48:17] recognize that smoking furnace was
[1:48:19] death.
[1:48:20] But Lord Jesus, you conquered it for us.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, tonight I pray that Lord,
[1:48:26] if there's anybody that doesn't know you
[1:48:28] in the power of your resurrection,
[1:48:29] Father, where they could truly look in
[1:48:32] the mirror of your word and say, "Mama,
[1:48:35] that's me." Where they could truly look
[1:48:38] in the mirror in in in their own eyes
[1:48:42] and say, "I don't understand it, but you
[1:48:44] called me. You chose me, and I accept
[1:48:47] it." Father, if there's anybody that
[1:48:49] doesn't know you in the power of your
[1:48:51] resurrection, Father, I pray that
[1:48:53] tonight, this would be the night, Lord
[1:48:55] Jesus, that they would make a stand for
[1:48:57] you. And Lord, that they would be able
[1:48:59] to make a covenant with you, Father,
[1:49:01] that they would accept the covenant that
[1:49:03] you've already given us so free, Lord.
[1:49:05] And if there's anybody here that maybe
[1:49:07] has just grown a little cold, Father,
[1:49:09] that maybe has forgotten about the power
[1:49:11] of that covenant, that it's an
[1:49:13] everlasting covenant, then nothing can
[1:49:15] take it away from us, Lord. Father, I
[1:49:18] pray that you would just remind us,
[1:49:19] Lord, that you would allow us to be
[1:49:21] encouraged, Lord Jesus, to recognize
[1:49:23] that, Father, there's nothing that can
[1:49:25] change your covenant with us.
[1:49:29] Father, we love you tonight. We thank
[1:49:31] you for your word. We just ask, Lord
[1:49:33] Jesus, that you would be with Brother
[1:49:34] Peter Bochi Manu in his absence here,
[1:49:38] Lord. Father, as he mourns the passing
[1:49:40] of his brother, that you would, Lord,
[1:49:42] bring him home safely at the appointed
[1:49:44] time. That you would, Lord Jesus, bind
[1:49:46] up the brokenhearted, Father. Lord, that
[1:49:49] you would be with the family as they
[1:49:51] mourn. Lord Jesus, and all the rest who
[1:49:54] are traveling, who are away, Father, we
[1:49:56] love you and we thank you. We just
[1:49:58] commit their lives into your hands now.
[1:50:00] Keep your hand upon us as we go our
[1:50:02] separate ways. Be with our friends from
[1:50:03] Arizona, Lord, as they travel. Grant
[1:50:06] them traveling mercies, we ask. And
[1:50:08] Lord, if it's your will for us to gather
[1:50:11] again on Sunday, hallelujah, Father, we
[1:50:14] will truly come recognizing that you
[1:50:17] have brought us here once again, Father.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; That it is a day that you have created
[1:50:22] and we will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Father, we ask all these things now in
[1:50:28] Jesus Christ's name
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; we pray. Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Can we sing 12:35?
[1:50:35] I speak Jesus.
[1:50:37] I speak Jesus.
[1:50:42] I just want to speak the name of Jesus
[1:50:50] over every heart and every mind.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I know there is peace within your
[1:51:01] presence.
[1:51:04] I see Jesus.
[1:51:13] I just want to speak the name of Jesus.
[1:51:20] Every dark condition starts to pray.
[1:51:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:29] There is hope and there is freedom.
[1:51:34] I see Jesus.
[1:51:41] Your name is
[1:51:45] Your name is
[1:51:49] Your
[1:52:00] Sh.
[1:52:12] I just want to see the name of Jesus.
[1:52:33] I see.
[1:52:41] I just want to see the name of Jesus.

[1:54:03] Jesus.

[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; We are thankful Jesus.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. Can we sing 1212?
[1:55:35] Goodness of God.
[1:55:38] Do you love him tonight?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; For your mercy never fails me.
[1:55:51] All my days
[1:55:53] I've been held in your hands.
[1:55:58] From the moment that I wake up
[1:56:02] until I lay my hand,
[1:56:07] I will sing.
[1:56:16] Heat. Heat.
[1:56:26] Heat. Heat.

[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Take a look around, brothers and
[1:58:58] sisters.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; See the goodness of God.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of the most high God.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Can we sing just a chorus of 4:45 as we
[1:59:09] dismiss? I love him.
[1:59:14] I love him. I love him.
[1:59:19] Oh, I
[1:59:22] love him.
