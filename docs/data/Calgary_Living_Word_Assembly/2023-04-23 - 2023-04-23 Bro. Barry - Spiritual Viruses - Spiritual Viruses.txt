robe of righteousness that you have given us in our day and dress ourselves in it father and approach you that way then it's death to us father we don't desire any other way we don't want to slip in through a window we don't want to come through a back door we want to come your provided way Lord Jesus we want to clothe ourselves in your righteousness this morning Father and Lord Jesus if there's anything in our lives that would be displeasing unto you today we just ask that you would forgive it just now and father we pray that we could just ask you to purge us of any iniquity in our lives father every one of us has many Lord much iniquity father and we know that Lord Jesus that in the last days the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity shall abound father help us to not have

know that there's always a time and a place appointed of the father Lord where you will send your Angel by their way and we thank you for doing that in the name of Jesus Christ oh Father it's not right for a 14 year old child to have to contend with that and we know there was a story in the Bible father that you allowed to be there for our benefit Lord so that we could recognize that many times our ways are not your ways and our thoughts are not your thoughts oh but father if we could just surrender to your ways and your thoughts Lord if we could just push aside our own thinking Lord and allow your thoughts to shape our thinking father Lord we could see things in a different light we thank you for touching Isaiah in the name of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we just want to continue

morning and I'll keep the musicians here we have a baby dedication we're certainly thankful for and there's nothing greater I think than to be able to thank the Lord for a life that he's given us we know that he's given us all of our children all of our babies they're on loan to us they're not something that we just do and we decide on our own but it's something that God gives us and all of our children are ours our own thank you brother Toby boy I don't know if I'll be able to pronounce that but we'll give it a go if you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read a scripture out of Luke Chapter 18. this is not our text this is for the baby dedication Luke chapter 18. sorry I'm wrong forgive me Mark chapter 10. [Music] Mark chapter 10. [Music] start with verse 13. very familiar story and they brought young children to him while Jesus was with his disciples they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them this morning we would like to invite for the John sister Esther sister Faith Fife as we dedicate whether Jeremy John Olu Fey yo kunmi ojirabessa I'm not sure how many letters are in that name but it's big and it says means God has more joy to me just like to invite you to come at this time as we sing bring them in oh bring them in me [Music] to Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] don't know if you can see him he's fast asleep very content so wonderful little children my goodness we just want to follow the instructions of the Lord he said to bring the children and give them to me this morning we'd just like to dedicate our dear brother this morning let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you one more time that we can approach your throne father not come to you asking for something Lord but to Lord bring something to you to bring a sacrifice of praise Lord Jesus to recognize that our children you have given to us father you had an angel waiting father for this child to be delivered and father there was a living Soul placed in this boy at his time of Deliverance and we thank you for that Lord we just pray Lord that you would watch over brother Jeremy John hold your best of this morning Father we thank you for this gift of life that you have blessed brother John and sister Esther with we just ask Lord Jesus that you would keep sickness from their home that you would keep sickness from this child father that you would just allow him to serve you all the days of his life and father as a as a brother as a pastor my prayer father and I'm sure we all agree is that this boy will be able to have the ability to receive the baptism of your Holy Spirit in an early age Lord father is such a wicked day and we know that we're living in the days of Luke 17 30 father we know what that means to us as Believers and father we pray that you would just allow brother John Jeremy father to just serve you with all of his heart Lord Jesus father we ask now that you would bless the older abessa Home Father be with the parents Lord be with the grandparents the siblings the cousins father the aunts the uncles Lord we just ask that you would bless them all abundantly father above all they could ask or think and Lord will be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory this morning we just dedicate our dear brother unto you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I don't know if anybody could hear it but he just said amen God bless you bless you buddy bring them in from the fields [Music] Jesus [Music] you happy this morning oh my if you have your Bibles this morning I would just like to turn to the scriptures I'd like to read from Saint John 5. thank you musicians Saint John 5 24 and 25. I'd like to welcome all of our visitors this morning certainly an honor and a privilege to have you here with us we uh look forward to shaking your hand after service today Saint John 5 24. Jesus speaking here verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the Dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and they that hear shall live God bless you this morning let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus that there is truly going to be a people on Earth that have the ability to hear and it's not a skill that can be taught it's not something that can be learned it's truly a revelation from you Lord it's the bread from heaven and father we just ask now one more time that you would sovereignly Reign that bread from Heaven father that you would break it open to us fresh once again Lord Jesus because we know that you've given us ears to hear help us Lord Jesus to just be quickened by this word father we pray that you would Quicken it to our very Souls Lord Jesus that it would just emanate from our very beings Lord Jesus as we carry on our lives father we might feel completely the same but Lord we pray that your spirit would just pour out of us that it would shine out of us to the world around us Lord we just love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated oh cool certainly thankful to be together once again just one little uh comment I wanted to mention if I could just remind everyone I don't really do a lot of housekeeping items but this is one that I think is important for all of us if we could remember when we come to the house of the Lord just to turn our cell phones off they can be a major distraction for people around us they could be a major distraction for us they could be a major distraction for the minister we know that the holy spirit is timid and we just don't want to bring any of the world into this environment we want to allow the Lord to be able to move in our midst so if you could please just remember turn your phone to silent if you want to bring it in that's fine um but if you can remember please just turn it off so we don't have distractions are you happy this morning I keep trying to have a drink here I had a uh maybe a late night or an early morning and uh just was wonderful time with the Lord and I just got into this scripture here and I think it's just just a wonderful thing you know verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life shall not come into the condemnation but has passed from Death unto life as a Believer when we can say that we truly have received the word for our day we have received the token in our lives we've been given the gift of the Holy Spirit then we know that we have the ability to hear the word and when we can hear the word what the word says here is that we've already passed from Death unto life there is no condemnation to those who believe and when we can sing We can sing with freedom we can sing with Liberty because we know where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and you know I just I'm really getting into the the discussion of um worship and I think it's going to be a tremendous series of of services to to think about what it's like when we worship now and what's it going to be like when we worship over there and what was it like when they worshiped in Jesus day what was it like to actually be raised from the dead how did Lazarus worship how did you know some of the people in the Bible worship and uh I think that worship is just it's it's the very essence of a Christian's life of a Believer we we worship but we worship in spirit and in truth and unless we're worshiping in spirit and in truth then we're not worshiping at all God many people will be worshiping but they won't realize they'll be worshiping Satan they'll be worshiping the God of this evil age and we know that no other age has had a God no other age has had a God that has been evil every single age has had the word of God but there's only one age brother Bradham said the last age the final age where Satan has been declared the god of the age the God of this evil age and that's the age we live in I certainly appreciated the service on Wednesday where brother Gilbert he brought how what what does Luke 17 30 mean to us what really does that mean to us is it just a buzzword to the message of the hour that we are used to Luke 17 30 Malachi four five and six Revelations 10 7 10 10 1-7 I I just was studying it this morning and and I went back to it again and you know Lord willing we could potentially turn there maybe we should just turn there Revelations 10 verse 7. and maybe just said a little bit of a background for what what we're talking about today I just think it's so incredibly important for us to never overlook this Revelations 10 1-7 we know that scripture so so very well Revelations 10 1 to 7 and 7 being the sort of the Hallmark of the message of the hour but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished when he should begin to sound he began to sound back in the 50s back in the 40s the mystery of God has finished brothers and sisters if someone's still talking about a mystery then they've missed it it's happened the appearing has already taken place now we're looking for the word coming of the Lord and that's going to be in The Bride of Jesus Christ we know that and when she gets so close to him she will become one brother Branham says that she will have his very virtues she will have his very essence she will have himself she will be he and isn't that such a familiar narrative these days with all of the males that have changed and now they're legally females wanting to go on different sporting groups and Olympic things and all this stuff why are they doing that brothers and sisters it's because it's the anointing of the age that is all of creation groaning for the manifestation of who us they don't realize it and people will say well brother bravery you're crazy you're going to say the whole world is actually being being driven by us yes Grace is on Earth right now and she is compressing the darkness because Darkness flees from light and if you have the spirit of Christ in you this morning then you are pushing back the darkness of this world you're pushing back Luke 17 30 as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man Ministry we heard it loud and clear on Wednesday we heard it back in the Easter meetings the son of man Ministry has a little tiny space of time in between the Son of God Ministry and the son of David ministry right now we're in that little midst of time that little time is called the son of man Ministry that's where God himself comes down and manifests in human flesh we've read the quotes over and over again I'm not going to get into it that way today today I've got a totally different topic but here we are brothers and sisters in the midst of it as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man what was it in the days of Sodom they were into same-sex marriage so much so that they wanted to invite the Angels who they saw as men they weren't interested in in normal relations we know that lot said to them you know leave them and you know come on don't be rude just take my daughters they've been married but they're virgins just go ahead and take them and do what you want with them how can that be how can that be how twisted or perverted was it in that day you know brothers and sisters I can't help but think that there's no greater perversion maybe I shouldn't say it but I feel it then a man that would want to actually change his sex to become a woman and a woman that would want to change her sex to become a man and then the two would think they could come together and wed in holy matrimony that is the epitome of perversion according to the word of God we love The Sinner but we hate to sin you know brothers and sisters I'm a sinner saved by grace I've been given the ability to hear the word for my day and I received it gladly and everyone else that does it they're a sinner but they're saved by grace you don't have to remain that way and you know we don't look down at people and say Scoundrels they're behaving this way they're cannon fodder and they're just lost and you know what they're they're they're they're not even foolish virgin they're just terrible people you know what it's not even our choice to have ears to hear the word for our day if we have years to hear the word Friday it's because God chose you before the foundation of the world to be there to hear it brothers and sisters we've got reason to make noise and to rejoice and to say thank you Lord for what you've done for me thank you Lord for saving my soul that was dangling over Hell by a chain with a very weak link of humanity oh my but one day you gave me the ability to hear oh you sent a prophet and that Prophet said that you never even did it in the first place brothers and sisters we've got reason to rejoice in this scripture Revelations 10 1-7 is fulfilled it's happened it's history that that mystery is history brother Bradham even says it that way the mystery is history now we have verse 8 to 11 and the voice which I heard how did he hear it how'd John hear that voice he was called to hear that voice The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel it's not partially closed it's not just six seals that's a doctrine of a devil if I ever heard it all seven seals are open the word of God says that open book take that open book and eat it up if Revelations 10 1-7 is already fulfilled then we're already into verse 8. go take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and and he was obedient and this is a type of the Bride John the type of the bride and I went to the angel the angel and said unto him give me the little book that's why I just I don't have to pause here maybe I'm I'm so sorry why did we stop printing books why did some people stop printing books what what we need to be giving out little books brothers and sisters right that's the scripture right here and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up take that book and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it wasn't my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it it made my belly bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and kings and here we are brothers and sisters we've been given a commission we've got to be willing to take this book and eat it up and not just stand and and quote we've talked about this we've got to be able to show we've got to be able to tell we've also got to be able to prove and that proving comes from the life that we live the life in which we display to the people we love and the life that we display to the people that we fellowship with the life that we display to the people we work with that we go to school with the life that we live you know brother Bradham his life we all believe brother Bradham was the prophet sent to this age brother Bradham it said very clearly that you couldn't tell his friends from his enemies can we tell our friends from our enemies I say Lord help me there's people that I don't really want to see there's people that I know that have treated me really badly in life that I just feel really awkward and uncomfortable around and if I can avoid it I try to I'm just being honest but that's not the right Spirit that's not the right attitude especially if it comes to Believers there's not going to be your department of heaven and my department of Heaven we're going to be one body in one mind and one Accord and then the Rapture is gonna go brothers and sisters we're not going to get to that place after the Rapture it's going to be before the Rapture the only way we're going to get there is to take this book and eat it and we'll become it and when we become this book we become him we don't just become this book it's not just an intangible thing we don't just eat the Bible we don't just eat books some people do that they eat weird things I don't even know what you call it it's a sickness I know it's a devil but people will take paper and peel it and eat it people will eat different things in this world but we're not going to do it literally we're going to do it spiritually but it's interesting because it's a it's a literal spiritual thing we're literally spiritually consuming this book and as we eat this book we become this book what a tremendous thing it is but the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again I believe we could just say that all day long Lord let that little voice that I heard from Heaven speak to me once again let let that voice speak once again Lord Jesus I just need to hear that voice I believe that's why we come to service we don't come to service to to see one another although we do we want to shake hands with one another we want to see our brothers and sisters of like Precious faith we want to greet one another but the reason we come to service ultimately brothers and sisters is for one purpose and that's to give him praise and when we give him praise he will speak to us but if we're not willing to give him praise are we going to hear from them personally I believe that's where we're going to start to say well this should be different and that should be different and we could do something else and all these different things and well the song leader and and and and and and and you know what we're going to come to a place where we're just going to shrivel up we got to be able to let our hair down and worship him in spirit and in truth how many people in the building are married maybe raise your hand there's a lot of people here that are married there's a lot of people that are wanting to be married I know that as well you know what God created us to be man and wife and as the wife we I know it because I'm a bride I'll say that I'm a bride it's weird I know but it's true the bride of Christ we're living in the bride age we call ourselves the bride you know the the the bride half made herself ready we know who we are and the purpose that we're here but brothers and sisters we can't just have a relationship with someone and just simply say you know I love you and and maybe write a sticky note once in a while and just give it to him and stick it on the mirror and say you know don't you remember I put that note there a month ago I told you that I loved you or or maybe to the Lord Jesus when I go to service once in a while and I'll just I'll give you a sticky note Lord and I'll just put it on the on the side of my Bible or something I'll make a note in my in my notebook and say I really love you Lord and that'll be it you know what there's no relationship there when we have a relationship you want to give all that you've got your heart burns within you to express what you have inside for that other person you don't have a relationship and just hold back and just say yeah you know you know I love you you know I love you I don't have to express it to you you don't even go there you just express it because you love her she loves you we love one another so we express our love think about how that one came and actually called you before the foundation of the world brothers and sisters gave you the ability to hear this word in your day can you not express your love for him I don't know I think that this this whole worship thing is gonna go to the next level at least for me just the way the Lord is leading me and showing me this how on Earth can we keep silent we know that the Lord said to the people you know what if you hold your peace immediately the rocks will cry out think about that brothers and sisters the highest level of Life the highest form of life on Earth was told if you hold your peace the lowest level of life on Earth which isn't even alive is going to cry out what does that say to us I my goodness today I want to talk about a topic and uh I hope it's okay I want to talk about viruses I want to talk about spiritual viruses today you know we just came out of a pandemic and some would say well we're still in it and I guess indeed we are in some countries in some ways how much has our lives changed since this pandemic since this virus that just went crazy in the world now we can look at it and say it's man-made virus or it's an engineered thing and it came from a certain place and all these different things and you know what all of that is going to be a fruitless Venture and and I don't want to go down that road I don't want to even try and teach us about viruses I want to speak spiritually speaking today but we know brother random said the natural types of spiritual and and we're dealing with the situation in our lives where Satan I believe is running rampant in our lives and how's he doing at brothers and sisters it's through a spiritual virus and if we're not careful we can catch a spiritual virus and that spiritual virus we could be infected with it and not even know it some people will be infected with we know covet we have all gone through it we've all seen it we've all seen what it does to certain people and it's what makes it so mysterious and I believe the devil is just as mysterious because some people will get coveted and they won't even have a sniffle I don't know what they call it is it asymptomatic is that what it's called they won't even know they're sick there's no illness there's no signs but yet they're absolutely positive but yet they'll come around someone else and and they'll just maybe breathe and and someone will catch the moist breathing of that person and they'll catch the virus and they'll have it and and it'll put them on life support in the hospital how does that work I just believe it's that subtle with the Devil and you know brothers and sisters it's just been on my heart I think that we can deal with something very similar to that spiritually speaking if we're not careful and and we have to guard ourselves how careful Have We Become just in general from dealing with this virus in the world I know I myself I've got a bottle of sanitizer in my truck I maybe I'm a fanatic for having it but I just think you know what I want to be a little bit prudent about this if I go and handle a gas pump I don't want to just do that and then just pretend everything is okay I want to be a little bit prudent we know that if we still go into certain places certain facilities we have to put on a mask whether the masks work or not I'm not here to debate that that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about is we're taking precautions as human beings because we recognize there's something many people will say well I know brother Barry it's exactly this and that and the other and I could just scientifically explain it and other people will say I don't think it's real at all but some people have died some loved ones have died what's going on something is happening in the world brothers and sisters I think everyone here could relate to that to say yes indeed something strange has happened and even to the point where the whole entire world could be affected by this now when we look at it it's very important to make sure that that that we recognize we're not wrestling against flesh and blood brothers and sisters we're wrestling against principalities and Powers it's not a flesh and blood struggle that we're contending with here in North America we've got everything made in the shade there's no issues here if you look at the rest of the world truly we are that one percent we can just go and make money if we need to we can just go and get a job we can just go and find money it's available we can just go and get jobs there's people in the world that are born into families they have no hope those children will never have hope their entire lives unless somebody comes along and gives them a leg up somebody gives them a helping hand aside from that brothers and sisters they'll never go to school they'll never be educated they'll they'll just be lucky to survive and and that is just a fact that's the way it is in the world but we on the other hand have it real good we've got it real easy in terms of that we don't have to struggle that way we don't have to take our children to the hospital and determine which child if we have more than one child in a hospital we don't have to say let's have a prayer meeting to decide who can get the medication that we need because we've only got limited funds to treat one of our children which one of those children now is going to be the one that gets to live and which one of those children is going to be the one that we can just commit to the Lord and hope that he saves that child that's not a game that we have to play but it's a very real thing in many other countries in the world and people can be infected people can get sick and get that way what got me thinking about this I'll tell you is Ezekiel the scripture in Ezekiel chapter nine if you want to turn there with me this morning we could uh we could just maybe talk about this here how do we get into spiritual viruses well Ezekiel chapter nine let's start with verse one he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen and a writer's incorn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen altar and the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where on he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's incorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and woman and come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and I was left that I fell on my face and cried and said ah Lord God will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy Fury upon Jerusalem then he said unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say the Lord hath forsaken the Earth and the Lord seeth not and as for me also mine I shall not spare neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the ink horn by his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou Hast commanded me we've had many conversations about this scripture and brothers and sisters this is a sign this is an example of getting the Holy Ghost in our lives only those people who really truly get the baptism of the holy spirit will be marked in their forehead they will have the mark from this man clothed in linen with the ink horn and once we have that Mark then we cannot be touched we can't be slain even if there is a virus that goes around Naturally Speaking because whether we live or whether we die we're Christ we know exactly whom we have believed and you know we don't have to live in fear but isn't it interesting even amongst Believers we see folks who are scared to death of getting a sickness that could hurt them that could kill them why is that why are we afraid if we believe I want to ask that question and I want to let it soak why would we be afraid if we believe we've got our families and we've got our friends but when we know that God is completely in control what do we have to fear but that's really I think what the problem is like the children of Israel said that the Lord hath forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not maybe he doesn't see that I have a virus maybe he doesn't see that I get sick maybe he doesn't see that I'm upset maybe he doesn't see that a brother or sister stepped on my toes and I'm really upset by it and I don't know how to deal with it maybe he doesn't see any of that brothers and sisters he saw all of that before the foundation of the world and he positionally placed us to go through it not so that we could be destroyed so that we could overcome it when we look at the weaknesses in our lives it's not so the weaknesses in our lives can destroy us he's not looking at the weaknesses in our lives he's looking at the theophany that he created for us that body that he has already made imperfection waiting for us on the other side he's not worried or wondering he's not upset or surprised by Our Lives he's just waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because he knows that everyone that he chose before the foundation of the world will come everyone will come to full maturity in their time we're not wondering whether the Lord has forsaken us or whether the Lord seeth not those those are the people that don't have the mark those are the people that are afraid to die those are the ones that say is Mark 16 really still in action is there really bomb in Gilead because I pray and I don't see a change the greatest Miracle brothers and sisters isn't to see the first and second pull in our lives in fact we're not living in the first and second pole Ministry we're living in the third pull ministry that's the opening of the word that's the recognition of who we are that's recognizing that we are he that truly when we speak it's deity speaking you know we have the mind of Christ and we know what to do with the word of the lord we don't have to be still some people will want to be still because they don't know where they stand they haven't really maybe matured that way and that's the way it goes we're all on a walk but we don't want to put anybody out and say you're just not mature enough we want to encourage one another when we see a child walking and stumbling we want to help them we don't want to tell them stupid child why'd you trip and fall we want to pick them up and encourage them and say you're doing a great job look at you walk two steps you know if you try again you'll walk two more and before long you'll be running as a child as Sons and Daughters of God that's what we want to do we know that the Lord has not forsaken the Earth and that the Lord sees everything the word of God says that his eyes are everywhere and he perceives it all he's aware of everything that's going on in our lives he's even aware of what we're thinking right now brother Bradham says you know this man clothed in linen he was actually set to go through the city and Mark those that sighed and cried for the Abominations in the land I mentioned this last Sunday I think it was maybe it was Wednesday it was both but I mentioned it because really brother Bradham says that this is truly the evidence of the Holy Ghost in our lives are we sighing and crying for the Abominations in the Latin brothers and sisters because if we're not sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land I'm not going to say you don't have the Holy Ghost what I want to say is perhaps we've just become distracted with the cares of life so much so that we're not aware of what day we're really living in because if Luke 17 30 really is something that's revealed to us then brother sister any moment now any moment now fire is going to rain from heaven but before that fire can rain from heaven the instant in the moment and the twinkling of an eye we know the bride's gonna go isn't it interesting I don't know what the formula is I had a brother I just want to say it I had a brother say it exactly what the calculation is what the twinkling of an eye is there's a definition in the in the dictionary that says what a twinkling of an eye is and if you look at the the the speed of light and you think about the twinkling of an eye that's faster than we can think brothers and sisters we can't even blink our eye as fast as a twinkle is in our eye because it's actually the speed of light reflecting off of our eye it's a tremendous thought but you know he's searching for those who are sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land and now this is where I want to get to this is where we're sort of getting into the main course now and and I think we're right on track I'm so happy about that what what I want to talk about is the spiritual viruses brothers and sisters where people can become infected with a spiritual virus and not even know it and and what they'll do is think that it's somebody else somebody else has caused a problem so now they have to separate themselves from the rest of the group not understanding that spiritually they have an illness there's something wrong there's something isn't right because the spirit of the Lord is where there is Unity not separation but sometimes people become infected with a spiritual virus and don't even know it and and this is where I I want to get into today brothers and sisters I don't want to say that we need to be sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land where we're talking about the transgenderism and all of the sinful natures and we can see all that around us and sure it makes us sigh and cry but you know what's worse is when people get upset and they leave church when people get upset and they can't fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith you know there's something wrong there and we were having a conversation about it just yesterday but brothers and sisters to me my way of thinking that's the Abomination that's in the land and it's not that that person is creating an Abomination it's the devil that's doing it the devil is saying that God's eye is not on us people God is not aware of what's going on God is very aware of what's going on and he allows the circumstances and situations to come up to see how we're going to react to them sometimes we get situations where we get a virus and you know the viruses never really leave viruses stick around a while we can get treatments for viruses but really what has to happen is the body the body needs to be able to overcome that virus that's inside of us but speaking about a spiritual virus brothers and sisters we don't have to tolerate that we don't have to say I've got this thing and and I just can't deal with it and and so now I'm just gonna separate myselves from the body that's not that's not not something we need to do the bottom talks about what the Holy Spirit evidence was and forgive me it's out of questions and answers number three holy spirit it's paragraph 69 if you want to bring it up if you can now what let me just give you a little twister here just a minute I'd say how many has the Holy Ghost all of you raise up your hand I'd say all right I'll see if you have the Bible said that they that had the Holy Ghost sighed and cried night day and night for the Abominations done in the city now how many hand would go up how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of God and so sad for the people that's lost that day and night You Weep and cry for the Abominations you won't see who would be in the city who would be that in the city how many is that's in the church that's what the Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was he told the ceiling Angel Ezekiel 9. that's right he said take go through the city and set a mark on those who sigh and cry for the Abominations in the city the rest of them let the destroying Angel destroy them no matter how much members they was how many of the things they've done said put a and a man with an incorn writer dressed in white which represented the Holy Spirit came forth and put a mark upon all them that sighed and cried for the Abominations done in the city now you say and watch what he said in there also slay utterly the children old women babies kill them all little children yes I just think it's so important for us to recognize brothers and sisters that was naturally speaking and now today we're spiritually speaking and talking about spiritual viruses Spirits travel on words and and when we speak we're either going to speak the Oracles of God or we're going to speak carnally of this world and the devil is so slick he will totally entangle himself in words if we have a negative thought a word is a thought expressed because we have a thought doesn't mean we have to express that thought as a word but there's something inside of a human that the devil plays upon where he'll say even as a believer we know that we can actually talk about a brother or a sister because of whatever it is maybe it's a cultural thing maybe it's a traditional thing maybe it's a family thing we can say because there's a situation now we can speak bad about a situation no you can't not according to the word of God what's going to happen brothers and sisters is we're going to actually now influence another person and brother Bradham I wanted to bring up the quote but I just didn't get there this morning I apologize but brother Branham he says that you don't have to kill a man you can just assassinate his character all you have to do is talk bad about a brother or talk bad about a sister and you can assassinate their character and he also says that we'll answer for that one day and it's okay when it's privately behind closed doors but remember even though those people said that his eyes are not seeing what's going on he is very aware of what's going on because the word of God says that I'll say it this way not the word of God the prophet in our day said that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words are so many times we don't even express all of the thoughts that are in our our hearts that that really we think and and you know brother Toby brought it so good just because we have thoughts come doesn't mean that needs to dictate our thinking if we're feeding in the right place what we're going to do is draw the right thoughts into our body and and we know that the word of God says to take every thought into captivity not some thoughts and most thoughts and say that you know what I've just got this thing it's it's a it's a cultural thing or it's a it's a genetic thing for my family and I just speak faster than I think you know we need to slow down we need to maybe change things in our lives so that we can be according to the word of God it says to take every single thought into captivity and then speak think about what's come into our heads and say is it something that I should say and and I'll say hey you know what brothers and sisters I'm the first one that needs to come to and there's probably people saying Amen brother because you're the preacher you've got to watch what you say from here I have to be filtering these thoughts quickly so that I can speak the right words because if I come here and I start speaking the wrong thing brothers and sisters I can infect people with a spiritual virus and we'll feel just fine we'll leave this building and everything will be just fine we'll say wow it was a great service tremendous service brother Barry I hope you'd say that but it could feel that way it could appear that way for all intents and purposes but something could have been said that's not right that's not true and if we don't deal with it accordingly it can infect people it can cause an infection and really what happens is people get infected and they don't realize it and then they start to look at a brother when they'll say well that brother did this to me and and don't anybody doesn't anybody know that this brother did this to me doesn't everybody care that this brother did this to me and before long they can go and talk to another brother or another sister and what happens is that spiritual virus just keeps getting passed and getting passed and sometimes people who pass it it doesn't affect them at all and sometimes other people it affects them to the place where it'll almost put them in the grave and many times we don't even recognize it because we just feel the same we're normal human beings but Spirits are traveling in our words that's why we have to take our thoughts into captivity just because we have a thought doesn't mean that's our thinking our thinking is according to the word of God our thinking is always going to say but what does the word of God say about the situation what does the word of God say about that thought what does the word of God say about my brother what does the word of God say about me we're always going to bring it back to that brother Branham he goes on to say uh same one yes it is set of questions and answers certainly powerful anything that denies the word of God brothers and sisters we need to just take a step back and take a breath and not not not cause a fight not cause a Schism or a problem with our brother or our sister but anything that denies the word of God we just need to say hold on a second and we need to think about that for a second when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let any of them live if it's a cute little baby a little amalekite or an Amorite kill it he said you remember he'll grow up to be an amalekite and he'll pollute the camp we know that we've heard it said many times Jesus taught that when we make bread a little bit of Leaven will leaven the whole lump and a little bit of yeast a little bit of yeast there it'll it'll grow and manifest and grow and manifest and multiply and manifest and it'll it'll it'll it'll take over the whole thing you won't have to do a thing it'll it'll become leavened bread and and if we just let the little things go in our lives brothers and sisters then what's going to happen is it's just going to manifest and it's just going to grow and manifest and grow and we need to kill that thing when it happens and I want to say this very clearly I I had an experience I said it in the men's meeting I'll say it in front of everyone I had a time in my life where I had an issue with a brother and I wanted to go and I wanted to smack talk that brother because I was right I felt like I was done wrong and that made it right right I wanted to go on smack talk about this brother to another brother and I thought for sure that he would listen to me and everything would be okay we'd be high-fiving that you were done wrong and everything was right and we'll go and pray for that brother because he's our brother right and what happened was that brother said to me you know what shut your mouth I don't want to hear another word that's my brother and I don't care what happened he's my brother and he's filled with the Holy Ghost just like you're filled with the Holy Ghost go away and don't bother me with any of it and you know what that did was that changed my life I might have said this from the pulpit if I haven't or if I have I I hope it's beneficial to someone brothers and sisters don't listen to smack talk about a brother or a sister that's evil that's the devil speaking and if you don't think that that's true think about when Peter the rock the one who Jesus chose to give that Revelation to he said my Father in Heaven gave you that Revelation Peter you're the one that we're going to build the church on and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it we know that that's the Catholic church that said that but we know as Believers it was the Revelation that was given to him how many other of the disciples wish that they were the ones I want that Revelation why would you just give it to him and not me not knowing that he gave it to everyone but he just manifested it through him but we know that one is the one that he said no no nobody's going to take you up and kill you because I'm gonna fight to die I'll die before they take you and he said get behind me Satan he didn't say get behind me Peter because he recognized The Voice the words that were being spoken were not words encouraging wasn't according to scripture brothers and sisters it's not okay to smack talk it's not okay to say negative things about a brother or sister whether you're in a car whether you're in a back alley whether you're under a bus whether you're in a house whether you're in a sanctuary whether you're in a basement whether you're on an airplane whether you're on a private island somewhere totally secluded away from everyone in the world God's listening and so is Satan it's a spiritual virus that we're gonna pass if we do that but if we take the thoughts into captivity and recognize that's contrary to the word of God Satan will be powerless before us brothers and sisters you know what this is just one Avenue that I believe Satan has access to the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's why I'm preaching it today that's why I feel it necessary to talk about it's no accident that we just went through a pandemic brothers and sisters but we don't have to tolerate Satan and his antics we can say to him you know what I know that thought is from you Satan and you just need to remember this one thing this one thing Satan that Revelations 10 20 sorry verse 10 says that you're going to be cast alive into the burning Lake of Fire where the Beast and the false prophet already are brother Branham says it Satan hates the Book of Revelation and he hates the Book of Genesis and the reason he hates it is because it shows his beginning as The Serpent and it shows his end as as the Beast as the the serpent again it's the same serpent the devil that old serpent is the way Revelation words it why does it say that it's not because he's throwing a snake into the Lake of Fire he's identifying it's the very same spirit that was there in the garden of Edom that entered into that serpent but he's going to be cast alive into that Lake of Fire and you know what will happen when we do that he'll flee because the word of God says to submit yourself therefore unto God first and then resist the devil and heal free to take that thought into captivity when a brother and a sister does it and you know what we don't have to fight I'll have to say shut your mouth I needed it that way I had to hear it that way many times in my life I need to get that that two by four smack to really understand something and many other times I just need a simple conversation just for the record you don't have to beat me up I can hear and I'll listen but you know what I'm saying brothers and sisters we can simply say you know what politely I I I just don't think I agree with you and I'm not willing to go down that road of actually speaking negative about anyone because the word of God says that we should speak positive about everyone the prophet for our day said say nice things about your brothers and your sisters so where would we have the opportunity to speak evil about anyone we don't there isn't anything that denies the word of God watch out when Joshua entered the land of King this is Brother Brown speaking he said don't you let one of them live if it's a cute little baby a little amalekite or an Amorite kill it you remember he'll grow up to be in a malachite he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the word of God get rid of that thing he says I don't care what denomination it belongs to interesting how he goes from the story of Joshua and Kanan to talking about a denomination and where this thing came from because you know what we deal with those things even in the message of the hour we drag traditional teachings into the message of the hour many times not even knowing it but all we need to do is humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and he'll Lift us up if we're willing to do that says well you say Well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to the word get the thing out of you get away from it brothers and sisters don't listen to it if you listen to it you're going to become it it will get on you he says well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to the word get the thing out of you it's it's a growing little amalekite looks cute looks innocent it looks like it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it now I'm going to say this don't don't stay away from my brother and sister don't say no they're they're they're to Malachite and they talk negative so I'm never going to be around them you know if you have a friend that has that tendency and they're a Believer try and be the encouragement to them we have the ability to do that we know that we can cover a multitude of sins that's what the word of God says right but it also says that evil speaking corrupt conversation what does that do that upsets the righteous it can be it can be a cute little amalekite but if it denies the word stay away from my brother Adam says he goes on to say who sigh and cry for the Abomination that's in the city where did you see that I can show you ten thousand speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin that can't even pray an hour but did you know the Bible said Mark only those who sighed and cried for the Abominations in the city how many you ever read it sure that was the Holy Spirit come forth to Mark the people and said to the destroying Angel go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have the mark upon them and the mark of God is the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God and you know brothers and sisters that's what we talked about there a week ago wasn't it or two even already Easter the Easter seal of God that seal containing death was broken because he overwhelmed the grave he totally overtook all of his enemies in a triumphal measure totally made an open triumph over all of it but that Holy Ghost is the Seal of God today talking about viruses spiritually speaking nasty little creatures and I want to say devils you know what they do they live off the life of other beings that's what viruses do they can't live unless they have a host unless there's a place for them to live unless there's a place for them to hide unless there's something that's willing to give them a residence you know there's viruses Naturally Speaking that we can't control there's nothing that we can do about it sometimes we'll get them I believe we can get them in in the full measure of them and Mark 16 is in full swing brothers and sisters it's fully underway in our lives we can say it doesn't matter what happens to us and that's why I say personally we all have to take our own choice about it I don't know where anybody stands it's your own thing but whether we live or we die we're Christ so if I could be free to move about and you're going to stick a needle in my arm that could be genetically engineered something that's going to potentially at someone's will change me into another being or whatever it's going to do modify my genetics or whatever I don't care put the needle in my arm because Mark 16 says that nothing can harm me unless God says that it will harm me I'm not afraid of that just like I'm not afraid to get the virus if I've got to get the virus God wants me to go and get the virus then give me the virus that's okay he can't touch my soul this flesh is gonna perish brothers and sisters but it can't change the quickening power that's what we talked about with the Easter meetings but these little viruses they need hosts they need places to live they need places to hide spiritually speaking the same thing they need places to live they need places to hide and if we can actually just not give them a place to live and not give them a place to hide they're going to die they're going to shrivel up and say there's no point going around Calgary Living Word assembly because there's nowhere for us to hide every time we get sent to go and attack those people they always overcome us because they're not willing to allow any virus into the camp we have the ability to do that brothers and sisters otherwise if we don't recognize our position what happens the virus gets in we have conversations it's okay we'll pray for our brother our sister we'll we'll we'll do something for them and we'll hope that that they'll just be able to get over it because we'll pray for them we'll remember them in a prayer meeting now that we've slaughtered them in the conversation that we've had about them but you know will it change or will that virus reproduce I want to say that virus will reproduce if we're not taking that thought into captivity and saying nope don't want nothing to do with it I'm going to break that chain of custody right now it's not going any further than this conversation what happens is that virus no longer has power that virus can no longer come after you and I want to say by experience by someone who was infected with that virus their whole entire life even after being saved I would say baptized filled with the Holy Ghost even after all of that still had that virus there came a time where I was able to be delivered from it though where my brother showed me that you don't have to live your life that way and you didn't even say it that way he just told me to shut your mouth I don't want to hear it but I walked away from there thinking wow what was that but I know what it was it was the Lord speaking to me giving me deliverance from that and we know brother Bradham he brings it out very clearly in Elisha's day he didn't go up with the prophet in his day he wasn't supposed to he was supposed to grab that mantle and go forwards with the message of the hour for his day and what happened brother Branham says it it was the dinner time conversations that the parents were having with their children where their children came out now and they mocked the prophet wasn't the parents it was a conversation that the parents had behind closed doors where nobody could hear and everything was safe and fine and what happened was those children went out and they lost their lives brothers and sisters that will happen spiritually speaking if we're not careful we've got to be careful with our families careful what we say around our children I say forgive me my children if I've said anything untowards things that maybe you shouldn't hear it's not healthy but I like in these little viruses today to be a little devil just waiting for the opportunity to spread to another host just looking for it just just begging for an opportunity to jump from one host to another looking for an opportunity because sometimes even if they do the one person might not be able to be infected but they can actually go from that person to the person the devil really wants them to get the one who is really vulnerable the one who actually will be able to be destroyed from it and that's how the devil works we can look at this and say brother Barry you're stretching it a little bit but you know the devil doesn't play fair he does not play according to the way we think we can play with fire a little bit in our lives and think that maybe a little Hollywood movie won't affect us or maybe a little bit of different music once in a while won't affect us I I know I I've I've been subject to it all I've lived in the world and I I've seen much way more than I ever wish that I would have but I know it was for a purpose brothers and sisters so I'm not naive standing here talking about this stuff we can deal with devils and not even recognize it in those situations but it can seem like it's a kind fine thing to bring into our home but what we're doing is we're polluting the minds and and The Souls of our very children by allowing these things in our homes into our lives the devil's just waiting for the opportunity to spread to another host why do you think that we have in the supermarkets they're still even there I was at Walmart a little while ago and I was shocked that they're still even there all of those stupid tabloid magazines talking about the royal family talking about this star and that musician and all this garbage they're good people I'm sure but why do they have that there because it's devils they're printing garbage to pollute our minds just waiting for the opportunity to spread to another host Devils travel in words and you know Jesus said that he that heareth my word how do we hear his word brothers and sisters by feeding on it we hear in our hearts but who has ears in their heart that's where we get into our innermost beings you know Matthew 12 it says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so you know brothers and sisters we have the ability to recognize it when someone's going through something in their life and maybe they are like I said Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost true blue Believers but they just get a little infected sometimes and sometimes they'll just get into a position where they forget who they are and and they'll start to really speak in a situation in a negative light and not really recognize that out of the abundance of their heart their mouth is now speaking and they're showing to another person what's going on inside of them and you know it works both ways we can see someone you get together with a Believer someone who's on fire for Christ and what is it a matter of seconds and you're talking about the word you're talking about the things of the Lord you're talking about what God's done for them in their life and all you can say is amen amen amen and did you hear this this is what the Lord's been saying to me and it just goes back and forth it goes both ways but we have the ability to stop it is what I'm saying when we get that negativity that negative spiritual virus that's knocking at our door trying to infect us we don't have to accept it we want to open the door to Christ we want to open the door to the word of God to come into our lives verse 35 says a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof on the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned I say Lord have mercy on me help me Lord I know that I have had evil words I know there's been things that I've said but you know I've gone and asked for forgiveness I've gone to people and said you know what I know that I've said stuff and that's it's not right and I just pray that you'll forgive me and they'll say you said what really I didn't even know I course I forgive you you know what if the spirit of God moves on one end brothers and sisters I promise you if that other person has the spirit of God they will receive you gladly and say hey don't even think about it it doesn't even affect me God bless you but you know what when they don't have the spirit of God when they're seriously infected with something they're going to be like yeah yeah I knew it and and and I don't know if I can get over it and and we'll see and maybe we'll just go and pray about it you know what we know people out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh right Christ bowed his head and died for us and we can't forgive one another for a simple thing that's happened in our lives some things are complicated but we still have to forgive but I wanted to say this brothers and sisters I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak sometimes we think that our words are just idle it doesn't matter we're just having a conversation it's not a big deal it's a quiet back room conversation about someone or something and is it affecting someone is it edifying the body or is it detracting from the body is it talking negative about the body sometimes it's not even about the body sometimes it's about a scoundrel in this world sometimes we're talking about someone who really is a bad person in this life but is that a positive conversation because Every Idle Word we're going to give account for and I would say the world we can look at that and say the world is going to give an account for Every Idle Word how much more the wife the living bride of Jesus Christ will she give account for Idle Words and as long as we're willing to look the Lord in the face and just come to him and and worship him and ask him to forgive us for our sins as long as we're willing to do like we did last week we showed that picture on the screen to have a daily death burial and Resurrection dying daily so long as we're willing to do that brothers and sisters we are not looking at judgment we're looking at Grace but when we don't actually do that when we don't humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord then we have a problem that's when we have an infection in Luke 6 it says for a good treat bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit where every tree is known by its own fruit four of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes a good man out of The Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built a house and dig deep and laid a foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat for him and Lee upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not It's Like a Man Without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great I Promise You Jesus was not speaking of construction he was not speaking of Renovations he wasn't speaking of masonry he wasn't speaking of carnal thinking he was speaking out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and unless we're willing to build our foundation spiritually upon the solid rock of the revelation of the word for our day then you know what's going to happen the enemy is going to come in like a flood brothers and sisters and how is he going to come in like a flood he's not going to come in like a flood like we think he's not going to have a river like in 2013 it's going to overflow the banks and flood everything and everything will be floating it's not going to be like that at all it's going to be out of the abundance of the heart the mouth is going to be speaking to us trying to corrupt us trying to get us to behave improperly as believers sometimes it happens we do as Believers but we just need to ask the Lord to forgive us and we know that the Lord said you know what you haven't wronged me you've made it right with me but just leave here oh I'm here and go on make it right with your brother your sister and then come back and worship me but if we're not willing to go and make it right with our brother and our sister he might not even receive our worship that's pretty shocking but it's true James 4 17 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin we want to make sure that we're not sinning today if we have a brush with a spiritual virus brothers and sisters it's a negative word brush it off brush it off in the name of Jesus Christ don't worry about trying to rebuke your brother or your sister and say get thee behind me Satan don't do that just simply kindly in love tell them I I don't want to talk about that because I know it's not going to edify me and it's not edifying you and it's certainly not edifying Christ so let's talk about the good things and you know I want to talk about it from a different aspect now we've really harped on the the fact that we can destroy a person's character if we see a situation that acts funny and we just don't know how to deal with it you know you can change that situation without actually going and physically changing the person you can start to actually use the third pull to your advantage brothers and sisters now this might sound like manipulation but I can tell you by by experience it changes everything you start to speak positive about that brother or that sister you start to speak positive about that brother or that sister and just see if things don't change it's not going to be instantaneous don't do that don't think it's going to be a great miracle because it's a third pole no no no no no give it weeks months years even but watch God change it all creation has to obey you if you're in line with the word of God because when you're in line with the word of God brothers and sisters it's not you speaking it's deity speaking you want to see a brother or a sister change start speaking positive about them if you've got a situation with a spouse you just don't know how to deal with it stop speaking negative about them don't joke about them there's no jokes in marriage brothers and sisters joking about your spouse is the is the direction that's the direction the arrow sign for a bad marriage don't joke about a spouse don't joke about the person that you claim to love think about God does he joke about us as a husband he doesn't joke about us he takes his bride very seriously very very seriously and every word that he says in the word is all positive about his bride isn't it how could we speak negative about our bride and think that we're going to get by with that joking to friends we're just joking you know what jokes go a long ways towards the negative side don't joke about your marriage brothers and sisters but Joshua we know going back in the scripture here he was instructed to cross over Jordan and when they got over to where they were supposed to go they were supposed to destroy everything I didn't even really get into what I wanted to today maybe we can quickly turn to the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 6. talking about the importance of our words and the importance of our voice what is it that brought down the walls of Jericho brothers and sisters we can say that it was trumpets and it was the word of God and we know that it was both it was angels that came it was an earthquake that happened but the children of Israel followed the instruction that was given to them we'll just read verse 5 of Joshua chapter 6 and it came to pass that when they made a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every man straight before him jump down to verse 10 and Joshua commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you to shout then shall ye Shout to think about the importance of the voice of the children of Israel no Idol banter while they're walking around while they're marching around following the instructions of the the Lord of hosts that gave to Joshua they were given a very specific instruction brothers and sisters to see their enemies defeat to get those walls to crash down it was follow my word to the letter and see what will happen and don't talk about it just keep your lips closed and when the time is right you have the ability to shout and we know they walked around the city seven times we know the story for the sake of time let's drop down to verse 16 and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord hath given you the city and the city shall be accursed even it and all they that are in therein to the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she did she hid The Messengers that was we sent and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest you make yourselves a cursed when you take of the accursed thing and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it and now we say but all the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord they shall come into the treasury of the Lord so the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpet and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with the great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went into the city every man straight before him and they took the city and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword s and sisters today I want to say that if we get a discussion if we get a spiritual virus knocking at our door Sometimes they come in different forms I've talked today just about the speech and how we can talk negative about someone Sometimes they come in different forms Sometimes they come in form of Doubt to say that you know is God's eyes really upon me we said that earlier according to the scripture in Ezekiel or God's eyes really upon the people of the city does he really know the situation that I'm in we can have doubt in our hearts and we know that doubt and faith cannot live together fear and faith will not coexist there's only one thing that can exist in the heart of a True Believer and that's faith and that's not even our faith that's God's own faith it has to be his Spirit living out through us but when we get to that place brothers and sisters when we see the negative things coming around when we can see doubt when we can see fear when we can see all of these different spiritual viruses that want to cling to us they want to get in us and infect us and cause us to affect other people we know that the children of Israel when they were over there what happened 12. Valiant men went over to spy the land but only two of them had the ability to not get infected with a spiritual virus but what happened the other 10 went back and affected just about 2 million people and what was it that they infected the people with they didn't just go and rub shoulders and affect them and say that now you've got the amalekite sickness and you've got the the Giant's illness it wasn't any of that it was their words it was their words of Doubt to say that no it's not God's will for this congregation to go this way or it's not God's will for us to go and take the land because we're we're grasshoppers in the sight of them how do they know what the enemy saw them as we know that Joshua despise actually said what the enemy saw them as the enemy said that our hearts melt within us when we see you coming because when you come we know that you have the Living God on your side but you know brothers and sisters I just want to say it this way when we come to the house of the Lord we have the opportunity I want to say it this way if I could substitute myself for Joshua I want to say when you come to the house of the Lord Shout to the Lord don't hold back brothers and sisters this is your place this is your time to see the walls of the enemy come down flat if you want to see the spiritual viruses fall away and get pushed back this is your place this is your time we don't know how many more times we'll be able to gather together like this brothers and sisters one of these days they're going to close the doors primarily and one of these days they could say oh there's a new strain of the virus and now it's overtaking the whole world and they're going to close it up are we going to go and Stream in our homes again Lord have mercy I hope not but you know there came a time when by when when the pandemic struck this was the last service we had a time where we didn't come together again for how long just about two years I think it's amazing that we're able to gather together this way one of these times they might come around and say you know what you're a part of that cult you're not going to have your doors open we will not allow you to gather and worship under the name of William Miriam Branham then what are we going to do that's when I would say all that can be shaken will be shaken what about the Believers that just barely get enough strength just barely get enough of a booster charge in their batteries to just barely make it to another service what about those Believers what will they do if we can't come to service brothers and sisters but then there's some they're just supercharged they've always got it plugged in they're always getting charged they've got solar panels and what happens is they're always generating electricity they're always getting that Dynamic Powers always in them because they just are right that's the life of a Believer sometimes we get a little bit down but brothers and sisters we don't want to be that person who is just barely making it getting getting polluted with the things of this world our minds have the ability to be polluted and Satan has some creative cunning devices to pollute our minds nothing better than the screens that we see nothing better than the social media that we allow ourselves to view I'm guilty of it nothing more cunning than than the stuff that that he gives us in this day but I just want to say it brothers and sisters we have the ability and you will never hear me say you're getting too noisy you're getting a little out of hand over there I'm going to say Amen you know what I want to do a Victory lap with you if you want to take one go for it if you want to do a somersault go for it if you want to jump out of your seat and scream praise the Lord go ahead and do it there isn't going to be any put offs with that here some people might get a little uncomfortable but you know what brothers and sisters if you have the desire to do that that might help other people to break out of their shells and say Amen you know what I know that I know that I know it doesn't matter whether I live or die I'm Christ and we have reason to Rejoice over that we know that Moses was instructed with uh with the signs he was given the plagues to go and infect the land and said let my people go and he told them who should I tell them I stutter I can't speak well who should I tell him sent me when he saw the burning bush and Jesus God in the bush said I am said I am you tell them that I am said I am that's the one I am has sent you and all the signs and wonders that he went and did they still wouldn't believe is it interesting to think about when we talk about the Rich Young Ruler signs and wonders brothers and sisters they're not going to do nothing for people if they don't believe if they're infected with a spiritual virus they could see someone come back from the dead and it won't change who they are that's what Abraham told Lazarus in hell when Lazarus said send send someone send Lazarus back to tell my brothers warn them that they won't come to this place of suffering and he said you know what if they won't hear the voice of a prophet they're not going to hear a dead man are you crazy but in Moses day he was given a final sign maybe I'll call the musicians as we close up here Moses was given a final sign and that sign was the plague of death and there was only one way that they could actually not fall victim to that plague of death there was only one way that they would not be affected by Death in their houses and that was to Simply take the word of the Vindicated prophet in their day and apply it to their homes and apply it to their lives and we know that that word in that day many times we just brush over it I think it's just good to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance think about it today brothers and sisters if you were to take blood and splatter it to the doorpost of your house and splatter it to the lintel over top of your door in the warmer temperatures we'd have flies buzzing around our houses the neighbors would all say you're crazy listen to those people they're they're part of that cult they've got something funny in their lives they're gonna have some sort of a doomsday cult thing going on look at them they've got blood splattered on their house why would they do that because the prophet of God said to do it and you know us in our lives brothers and sisters the devil said take the TV and kick it out of your house the devil said or brother Branham said take the TV and kick it out of your house that was God speaking to mankind that wasn't just a man saying those things we have been given the ability to overcome all of this stuff in our lives if there's something dragging us down brothers and sisters you know God will tell you and if you don't know and you want more success in your lives with God just ask him and he'll show you and when he does show you just follow the word just follow him I say it myself Lord help me I told you I had to battle with Facebook and you know what I found brothers and sisters this is how cunning the devil is I was really into music for a time and what happened I said it before probably but I'll say it again somehow I don't know how I didn't have Facebook until I was a Believer until I threw away all my CDs until I threw away all of my music accounts all of the stuff that I had somehow Facebook started to feed me the music that I used to love once upon a time feeding me feeding me feeding me and and as a silly child I would look at it and be saying oh I remember that I remember that song too and I know that one too and it started to become familiar and it started to come back and come back and you know what the Lord told me forget about it just get rid of it it's polluting your mind the devil wants to pollute our minds he just wants to distract us and you know what will happen when he distracts us it's not going to be the distraction necessarily that kills us it's going to be a distraction that allows a spiritual virus to get in and when that virus gets in brothers and sisters it's pretty tough to get it out but you know what we can get it out but we're going to go a long ways the wrong way if we let our guard down too far and think about it as parents in the home if we let down the guard in our home and we allow a spiritual virus to get in our children our children might not serve the Lord as long as we can see it and you know what doesn't mean they're lost but we might not see it with our own eyes doesn't matter though because we can't stop that quickening power and if we do what our dear brother and sister did today with our children we just commit them back to God because we know that we can't do it it's got to be God that does it he'll do it brothers and sisters if Rahab the Harlot could have her family saved I want to tell you today you can have your family safe commit them to God trust him brother Branham says it just keep holding them before the Throne of God your children and they will not be lost maybe stand with me this morning you know we just need to be like Moses he gave the instruction to apply the token in our lives if we're willing to apply the token in our lives we're not going to be misled by anyone that wants to try and and be caught up with a spiritual virus we're not going to be caught up in conversations we're not going to be deceived as the Bride of Jesus Christ as the feminine we know that once upon a time the feminine was pulled out of the husband and when she was there she was able to be tempted she was able to be deceived but this bride today will never be able to be deceived never the bride in Satan's Eden will not be just herself she will be him and that's the mystery that Paul spoke about back in in Ephesians what a tremendous thought it is brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us today if we have any situation any occasion where someone wants to smack talk just shut it down shut it down the sad I want to hear because it's just going to make me sick and I don't want that God bless you today let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray that you would just continue watching over us father as we go our separate ways today we thank you for your word Lord father we thank you that we have been given the ability to discern the spirits father we know the only way that we can do that is through your spirit living out through us father I know that not one of your children wants to have a sickness not one of us wants to have a spiritual virus Lord and many times we can be caught up with them but father I want to thank you for the delivering power of your word of your Dynamic life that can come down and speak to a brother or a sister and and be delivering to them Father we have the ability to hide a multitude of sin and father I pray that we could do that one for another I pray that we could be encouraging one to another I pray that we could speak good things about one another I pray that we would be encouraging about one another's children father I pray that Lord Jesus we would hold the token not just over our own home but that we would hold the token over each other's children in the body Lord that we would hold the token over our brothers and sisters that we can see they need help in their lives father Lord that we wouldn't put anyone out or bring anyone in we would allow you to do it and we would just stand in our positions as your wife Lord father just allowing you to move in the situations of Our Lives father we just want to rebuke Satan in the name of Jesus Christ if he has come into any one of our Lives Lord to any one of our families Lord Jesus to any one of our children's lives Lord we just want to commit them to you father we just ask that you would wash away that virus Lord Jesus and allow us to apply the token quickly father Lord that that that house wouldn't be swept out and garnished just waiting for him to come back with seven other friends worse than the one before father that we could just see the Deliverance in our children father we have the ability to apply the token and father we just Lord we want to take that opportunity and do it father Lord we ask that you would be with those who weren't here today that you would just be with them Father whether they're traveling Lord whether they're sick father each one of us needs a touch from you every single day of our lives and I pray Lord that we would be able to have that death burial and Resurrection experience father that we would die out to ourselves so that you could live through US father that Lord one of these days we know somewhere between six and nine in the morning Father everything is going to change Lord I pray that we would just be able to apply the token and go forwards with confidence knowing that we will not miss that day neither will our families father we love you and we thank you we ask that you would just be with us and now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing 1095 you deserve the glory [Music] you deserve the
