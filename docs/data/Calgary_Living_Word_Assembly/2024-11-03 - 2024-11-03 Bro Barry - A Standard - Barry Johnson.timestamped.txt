[42:07] 59 a little bit of a different direction
[42:11] but I think kind of in conjunction to

[42:19] a a pretty difficult one for me but many
[42:24] people were encouraged by it and I'm

[42:30] own um we certainly want to follow the

[42:35] Lord um Isaiah chapter
[42:39] 59 we'll start reading with verse
[42:48] 17 Isaiah
[42:51] 5917 for
[42:53] he put on righteousness as a breastplate
[42:58] and an helmet of salvation upon his head
[43:02] and he put on the garments of Vengeance
[43:05] for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[43:10] cloak according to their
[43:13] deeds accordingly he will
[43:16] repay Fury to his adversaries recompense
[43:20] to his enemies to the islands he will
[43:24] repay recompense
[43:28] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[43:31] from the West and his glory from the
[43:34] rising of the
[43:35] sun when the enemy shall come in like a
[43:39] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[43:43] up a
[43:43] standard against him let's just bow one
[43:47] more
[43:48] time gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[43:51] thankful for your word we thank you Lord
[43:54] that your word is applicable to every
[43:56] single one of us Lord and every single
[43:59] day that we live amen father we pray
[44:03] that you would take this bread of life
[44:05] that we've read and that you would break
[44:06] it open fresh to us Lord once again that
[44:09] father when we leave this building today
[44:12] we would say that truly you spoke to us
[44:14] amen father we love you and we thank you
[44:17] we just commit the service and all
[44:18] that's said and done into your hands For
[44:20] Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we
[44:23] pray amen amen you may be seated did
[44:27] this
[44:34] morning just uh one announcement today
[44:38] that I thought was really wonderful that
[44:41] I I know was a wonderful thing for
[44:44] everyone but uh just wanted to announce
[44:47] that brother John panicker is an uncle
[44:51] now for the third time God bless you
[44:53] brother
[44:59] for those of you that know brother John
[45:01] panicker and and his situation he's
[45:03] living with his brother and uh his
[45:06] brother had a baby I guess yesterday
[45:09] we're certainly excited to see what the
[45:11] Lord has in store for you brother and uh
[45:14] for your brother's children are you
[45:17] happy this
[45:18] morning I uh don't have many
[45:21] announcements I didn't really want to go
[45:23] too far that way I just wanted to talk
[45:25] about the the spirit of the the Lord
[45:27] today raising up a standard in our lives
[45:29] and if I had to make a title for today I
[45:32] wanted to say a standard and uh I think
[45:36] that's really the age in which we live
[45:37] in we're living in an age where there
[45:39] has to be a standard set we know that
[45:41] the enemy has come in like a flood we
[45:44] don't have to look around very far to
[45:46] see what the enemy is doing inside the
[45:49] world because we know that there's two
[45:51] Spirits at work in this world there's
[45:54] the spirit of Christ and there's the
[45:56] spirit of the anti Christ and some
[45:58] people might say well there's the spirit
[45:59] of the devil but I want to say this the
[46:01] devil is the most religious individual
[46:05] on Earth there's the spirit of the
[46:07] Antichrist and there's the spirit of
[46:09] Christ there's Satan and there's God
[46:12] there's one or the other there's no
[46:14] middle ground there's no delution
[46:16] there's no mixture any mixture outside
[46:19] of the Holy Ghost is Antichrist right
[46:22] any
[46:23] hybridization today we're talking about
[46:25] setting a standard last time we spoke uh
[46:28] we talked about having a standard in our
[46:30] lives and Lord willing I'm not going to
[46:33] be as heavy as I was last time I'm still
[46:35] sort of reeling from that and I uh yeah
[46:39] it's not easy to be here but uh we have
[46:43] a standard to uphold and uh that's the
[46:45] standard that we will hold and uh we
[46:48] know that brother bradam talks about it
[46:50] you know what if nobody else were to go
[46:52] with us we're going to follow this word
[46:54] of God we have got to follow follow the
[46:57] word of God that's the only thing that's
[46:58] going to help us in this
[47:00] world before we get too far I just
[47:03] wanted to mention uh we put out a notice
[47:05] about the brethren in Philippines in the
[47:07] Middle Island that actually were flooded
[47:10] severely and uh so we actually uh I just
[47:15] got a couple of pictures from brother
[47:16] mvin that uh this this information came
[47:19] from Brother mvin originally and uh we
[47:22] just wanted to bring a little update for
[47:25] what's actually happened in terms of uh
[47:28] the flooding that that happened there so
[47:30] bear with me for just one second did you
[47:32] get an email from me this morning good
[47:35] stuff so You' got the pictures you can
[47:37] go ahead and uh post the first picture
[47:39] if you don't
[47:41] mind I'm just going to come here yeah
[47:44] there we
[47:45] go so there's some videos too that we
[47:49] can share if you would like um we had
[47:52] put out a notice for the church that
[47:54] this flooding happened it was because of
[47:57] uh was it a
[48:01] cyclone a hurricane yeah yeah typhoon
[48:04] that was the word I was thinking of it
[48:05] was a typhoon that happened and uh it
[48:08] was the worst typhoon I think that hit
[48:10] the island in recorded history and uh
[48:12] the brothers and sisters there brother
[48:15] mvin indicated from brother Ryan in
[48:17] Philippines there that directly 33
[48:20] families and their congregation were
[48:22] severely affected most of them lost
[48:24] almost everything the flooding has
[48:27] subsided this was actually sent on
[48:28] Thursday as well the flooding has
[48:30] subsided to Knee Deep now in the ground
[48:32] floor of the church and so this is the
[48:35] before picture of the church and then we
[48:37] could just go to the after
[48:39] pictures I think there's is there
[48:42] another
[48:43] one is there another picture
[48:48] there that's the before and that's the
[48:50] after so everyone has sought refuge in
[48:53] there um brought their stuff into the
[48:56] church
[48:57] and we were able to raise some money and
[48:59] send it directly to them so I just
[49:01] wanted to just make a little notice
[49:03] about that so we understand what's
[49:05] actually happening and brother mvin and
[49:07] sister Fay are going over there next
[49:10] month they're going to Philippines and I
[49:13] believe they're going to give us a bit
[49:14] of a report on what's actually taking
[49:17] place but you can see the the church now
[49:20] sort of the before it was nice and
[49:22] orderly and now everyone's just crammed
[49:23] in there but it's interesting because we
[49:25] know the the the name of the Lord is a
[49:28] strong tower hey and and he provides a
[49:30] place for the righteous to run into and
[49:32] we know the natural typees the spiritual
[49:34] but this just really got me thinking
[49:36] about how the enemy comes in like a
[49:39] flood and it seems to be happening more
[49:41] and more the the more we we we see
[49:44] things in this world thank you brother
[49:46] that's all I want to show for pictures
[49:49] um I just wanted to bring a note with
[49:52] this um it goes into conjunction with
[49:54] what we're we're talking about today and
[49:56] it's out of Isaiah 59: 19 so shall they
[50:00] fear the name of the Lord from the West
[50:02] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[50:04] which is the East when the enemy shall
[50:07] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[50:11] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[50:14] him what I want to talk about today is
[50:17] the the standard that will be lifted up
[50:20] against the enemy I'm going to jump
[50:23] right to the end of the service right
[50:24] now so we can just wrap up and go home
[50:28] because I can see it's already 20 to
[50:32] 12 but you know brothers and sisters I
[50:35] think it's really important for us to
[50:37] understand just to bring some balance
[50:38] from last time we spoke I made it maybe
[50:41] sound like there's so much for us to do
[50:43] and we need to make sure that we're in
[50:44] line and we're conforming which is 100%
[50:47] correct but not with a man this is the
[50:51] critical Factor the word says when the
[50:54] enemy shall come in like a flood mean
[50:56] meaning that he will when the enemy
[50:58] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[51:01] the church shall raise up a
[51:04] standard the spirit of the parents shall
[51:07] raise up a standard oh the spirit of the
[51:12] family no everybody's quiet right
[51:15] because it's wrong the spirit of the
[51:18] Lord shall raise up a
[51:21] standard we cannot allow
[51:24] tradition we cannot allow a church we
[51:27] cannot allow an association or a
[51:29] membership it's got to be the spirit of
[51:32] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[51:35] and forever outside of that it will fail
[51:39] and you know honestly that's why most of
[51:43] the people in this world are grossed out
[51:45] with Christianity today because everyone
[51:47] is trying to raise up a standard
[51:50] themselves but then they'll turn around
[51:52] on Monday morning and go and pull a
[51:54] dirty deal in business or they'll go and
[51:56] talk about someone or they or they or
[51:59] they you know you know what I'm talking
[52:01] about that's the world in which we live
[52:04] in but we're not living in an age where
[52:06] we're talking about just conforming to a
[52:09] church we know there was a time where
[52:12] there was a reformation and I think it
[52:14] just is so good I'm going to read out of
[52:16] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[52:18] this morning just to maybe get us going
[52:21] brother bam talking about the warning
[52:23] out of the sardan church age out of
[52:25] Revelations 3 3:2 Be watchful and
[52:28] strengthen the things which remain that
[52:30] are ready to die for I have F not found
[52:33] thy works perfect before
[52:37] God even though they knew what they
[52:40] needed to do paragraph 63 here he says I
[52:43] wish it could be said that the sardan
[52:45] age was a restoration instead of a
[52:50] Reformation I cannot say that the word
[52:53] does not call it a restoration but
[52:55] certainly calls it
[52:57] a
[52:58] Reformation had it been a
[53:00] restoration that age would have been
[53:03] another penic costal age but it was not
[53:07] the best that could be said of it was
[53:09] strengthen that which remains that's
[53:12] ready to die and it just makes me think
[53:14] when I I read those
[53:16] words sort of a quote that I got in my
[53:19] heart when I grew up in the Pentecostal
[53:21] ranks and I I started to look around and
[53:24] see people living trying to live a
[53:27] standard but not being able to live it
[53:29] and and recognizing that you know what
[53:31] this is this is not going to work for me
[53:33] because I would rather just be honest
[53:35] about who I am and what I'm doing I
[53:36] would rather not go and and sin all week
[53:39] long and then come to church and pretend
[53:41] like everything is
[53:43] fine now I'm not saying everybody does
[53:45] that I know for sure that even in the
[53:49] Pentecostal ranks the prophet in our day
[53:51] said there's Believers amen there's
[53:53] Believers in every single denomination
[53:56] and we never want to Discount anyone but
[53:58] where I was I started to look at the
[54:00] carnality because I was immature and
[54:02] that's what we do right but I remember
[54:05] thinking you know what the the the word
[54:07] of God here it says the best that
[54:09] brother bam saying it not the word of
[54:11] God just to be clear the best that could
[54:12] be said of it was strength and that
[54:14] which remains that is ready to die those
[54:16] people that were there and I I remember
[54:18] as I was getting to it was I I thought
[54:20] in myself why would I pretend to be a
[54:23] Christian when tomorrow we die might as
[54:25] well eat and drink drink and just be
[54:27] married like everyone else in the world
[54:28] right there's revelings there's parties
[54:31] there's celebrations there's things that
[54:32] we could be participating in just like
[54:34] everybody else and everybody else still
[54:36] prospers they have good health they've
[54:38] got good jobs they have houses
[54:41] everything is fine in their life but is
[54:43] it if they were to come to the place
[54:46] where they were going to to to lie down
[54:48] on their deathbed right then would they
[54:51] know where they're going to
[54:52] go because that's what the Crux of all
[54:55] this is and terms of basic
[54:58] Christianity but when we go to the place
[55:01] where we are today well beyond the
[55:03] Reformation that brother bram's talking
[55:05] about here we might as well eat and
[55:06] drink and be merried because tomorrow we
[55:08] die we need to recognize we're not just
[55:12] reforming there's a restoration that
[55:14] took place which is pasted the
[55:16] reformation and that restoration has
[55:19] done something brother Ry goes on to say
[55:21] in the next paragraph there was
[55:22] something missing my yes there certainly
[55:24] was this age had justification but it
[55:26] had Miss sanctification and the baptism
[55:29] of the Holy Ghost we talked about this
[55:31] on Wednesday we have all three of those
[55:34] but I want to say this brothers and
[55:36] sisters just to take it and make it real
[55:38] basic and easy for us with the baptism
[55:40] of the Holy Ghost in our life we have
[55:42] one all of those three are one it's not
[55:45] a trinitarian Doctrine it's
[55:47] understanding that the Holy Ghost brings
[55:49] all of that justification and
[55:52] sanctification to our lives he goes on
[55:55] to say that's what God's original plan
[55:57] was that is what they had at
[55:59] Pentecost they were Justified they were
[56:02] Sanctified they were filled with the
[56:04] Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason
[56:06] for being justified and Sanctified is to
[56:10] the end that you might be baptized with
[56:12] the Holy
[56:14] Ghost now sometimes we can find
[56:17] ourselves Justified and we can find
[56:20] ourselves
[56:22] Sanctified but not filled with the Holy
[56:24] Ghost you can have both of those but not
[56:28] have the person of Jesus Christ Living
[56:31] out through us we can be very good
[56:34] people we could be tremendous Christian
[56:37] people a part of a wonderful Church body
[56:41] but still not be baptized with the Holy
[56:43] Ghost and we know there's evidences of
[56:45] the Holy Ghost the true evidence of the
[56:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost be able to say
[56:49] Amen to the word for your day we know
[56:50] that those people who are sighing and
[56:52] crying for the Abominations of the land
[56:54] we know that and and there's varying
[56:55] degrees of both of those but the one who
[56:57] truly has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:59] will say amen God sent a prophet and I
[57:01] believe it and that settles it there
[57:03] won't be any confusion around that but I
[57:06] just think it's beautiful they were
[57:08] Justified they were Sanctified they were
[57:10] filled with the Holy Ghost those people
[57:12] at Pentecost and I believe that's where
[57:14] we are today brothers and sisters
[57:16] Justified Sanctified filled with the
[57:19] Holy Ghost when we have that there's no
[57:21] more Reformation even the restoration it
[57:25] goes beyond restoration because it was
[57:27] restored for a reason and the reason is
[57:30] so that the hearts of the Pentecostal
[57:33] children could be turned back to the
[57:35] faith of the Pentecostal fathers now you
[57:37] might say well why did you say it that
[57:39] way brother Barry because if they were
[57:41] children they always were children we
[57:45] didn't just become a child of God one
[57:47] day we always were a child of God one
[57:50] day but through the restoration of the
[57:52] word through a Vindicated Prophet it
[57:54] gives us the ability to recognize that
[57:56] always were a son or a daughter of
[57:59] God they were Justified those Folks at
[58:03] Pentecost they were Sanctified they were
[58:05] filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to
[58:08] me the reason for being justified
[58:09] Sanctified is to the end that you might
[58:11] be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is
[58:14] the reason that there is a
[58:17] church
[58:20] period there could be soup
[58:22] kitchens my there could be work work
[58:26] bees there could be things where we help
[58:27] people maybe in floods times of floods
[58:29] we go and help people we offer space for
[58:31] people that need a a home after their
[58:33] home has been destroyed there could be
[58:35] financial aid there could be prayer
[58:38] meetings for people that need prayer but
[58:40] you know the prophet I'd say God through
[58:43] the prophet says very clearly the end of
[58:46] it all is so that you can have the
[58:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost am and what is
[58:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's Jesus
[58:53] Christ the person of Jesus his spirit
[58:57] that when he died on the cross and he
[58:59] said it's finished he bowed his head and
[59:01] the word says that he gave up the ghost
[59:03] that ghost was given up for a reason not
[59:07] to go back up to heaven but to come back
[59:09] upon Earth so that we could all partake
[59:13] of his
[59:14] spirit I think it's beautiful brother
[59:17] bam says that's the reason that there is
[59:18] a church it is the temple of God filled
[59:21] with God even the Holy
[59:24] Ghost so now I want to say this
[59:26] Where's the
[59:28] temple the temple isn't a building some
[59:31] people would say it especially if you're
[59:32] a Mormon you would say well they got a
[59:33] brand new Temple up in Northwest Calgary
[59:35] if you've ever been there it's
[59:36] spectacular it's stunning everything
[59:39] that's in there is from handmade from
[59:42] around the world nothing really is made
[59:44] locally it's it's all from around the
[59:46] world there's a temple in Cardston
[59:48] there's all kinds of temples there's
[59:50] many different temples there's mesonic
[59:52] temples we know many many temples
[59:54] there's going to be a third temple in
[59:55] Israel where we're not talking about
[59:56] those temples though we're talking about
[59:58] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and what
[59:59] does the word of God say the word of God
[1:00:01] says know ye not that ye are the Temple
[1:00:06] of the Holy Ghost that's why brothers
[1:00:08] and sisters we're talking about setting
[1:00:10] a standard it's not just something that
[1:00:13] we talk about it's not just something
[1:00:14] that we say well you know we're good
[1:00:17] people we do this or we don't do that
[1:00:20] there's a reason why we have a
[1:00:22] restoration to the word and not a ref
[1:00:26] formation I think that's just such a
[1:00:28] beautiful thought it's a restoration
[1:00:30] back to the original word not a a
[1:00:32] Reformation we're not taught to to
[1:00:35] conform it's not about that it's not
[1:00:37] about being reformed we know uh certain
[1:00:41] kids in their lives maybe like myself
[1:00:43] when I was a kid I know there was a
[1:00:45] discussion where my dad wanted to send
[1:00:47] me potentially he actually offered it to
[1:00:49] me at one point I could send you to a
[1:00:51] military school would you like that and
[1:00:54] uh you know the reason for that is for a
[1:00:56] Reformation parents don't know what to
[1:00:58] do with their children anymore because
[1:01:00] they're rebelling they're they're
[1:01:01] they're getting out of hand and I
[1:01:03] remember my dad really wanted to see me
[1:01:05] get
[1:01:06] reformed and I'm certainly thankful for
[1:01:08] that because he held a standard in my
[1:01:11] life and I knew what that standard was
[1:01:14] and there came a point in time where I
[1:01:16] could no longer live according to my my
[1:01:18] dad's standard so I had to leave I had
[1:01:21] to go my own way and you know it's
[1:01:23] wonderful because even though the enemy
[1:01:26] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:01:28] God will raise up a standard my dad
[1:01:30] raised his standard only so high you can
[1:01:32] only raise your standard so high for
[1:01:33] your children brothers and sisters but
[1:01:35] you've got to be the Holy Ghost for your
[1:01:37] children until the age of accountability
[1:01:40] and when you do that you hold that
[1:01:42] standard but there comes a point in time
[1:01:44] where you can no longer reach high
[1:01:46] enough to get that standard that the
[1:01:48] spirit of God will live for your
[1:01:50] children they have got to go on to the
[1:01:53] true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:01:55] what it's all about we just read that in
[1:01:56] the church age book The Spirit of the
[1:01:59] Lord will raise up the
[1:02:02] standard not us and when we try and do
[1:02:06] itall when we try and do it you know
[1:02:08] what usually happens is we usually make
[1:02:10] a mess of it we usually
[1:02:14] do I
[1:02:15] remember when brother Ken was Pastor
[1:02:18] here there were situations that would
[1:02:20] happen and uh I was a deacon and uh
[1:02:24] there's times where you would say
[1:02:25] brother can you know this brother can
[1:02:27] you know that brother can you know the
[1:02:29] other thing and he would say yeah I know
[1:02:31] and you'd be like why haven't you acted
[1:02:33] on that why haven't you done something
[1:02:34] you're the
[1:02:35] pastor because he would say you know
[1:02:38] what when the enemy comes in like a
[1:02:39] flood the spirit of God raises up a
[1:02:42] standard the spirit of the Lord will
[1:02:44] raise up the standard and it's not about
[1:02:46] jumping on and trying to do and fix we
[1:02:48] need to deal with this prayerfully we
[1:02:50] need to deal with it in a spiritual
[1:02:52] light and if we don't do it we're going
[1:02:54] to make a mess of it humanly speaking
[1:02:57] brothers and sisters today I want to
[1:02:59] talk about holding up a standard and
[1:03:00] understanding that that standard that we
[1:03:02] hold up is not our standard it's his
[1:03:05] standard the standards that we live in
[1:03:07] our lives are his standards the reason
[1:03:10] why the sisters don't wear garments that
[1:03:13] pertain to a man is because the word of
[1:03:15] God says that the reason why sisters
[1:03:18] don't cut their hair is because the word
[1:03:20] of God says that those are the standards
[1:03:24] that we live by because that's what the
[1:03:25] word of God says some people would say
[1:03:28] well brother bradam William Mariam
[1:03:30] bradam he brought that on the scene that
[1:03:32] guy that you guys follow that that
[1:03:34] that's the one that that set all these
[1:03:35] in motion no he didn't read your Bible
[1:03:39] Paul said it Paul the Apostle the first
[1:03:43] church age messenger he's the one that
[1:03:45] set the church in motion he's the one
[1:03:48] that set the church in order and any
[1:03:50] other pattern after that is false
[1:03:55] even William brandham preached what Paul
[1:03:58] preached amen for the purpose of keeping
[1:04:01] the church exactly in
[1:04:04] order he didn't bring something new in
[1:04:06] fact what he pointed to was what Paul
[1:04:08] said if anybody else comes and preaches
[1:04:10] another gospel to you then that which
[1:04:12] I've already preached to you let him be
[1:04:14] a
[1:04:16] cursed so why would we think it's any
[1:04:18] different you know I I was having a
[1:04:19] conversation with a brother the other
[1:04:21] day and I thought it was so funny it was
[1:04:22] the first time I'd ever heard it before
[1:04:23] but this is the age in which we live in
[1:04:25] if you look back into the early 1900s at
[1:04:28] pictures we we I'm just getting excited
[1:04:31] I guess we were in a a restaurant and it
[1:04:34] was all about the the early train days
[1:04:37] and there was a picture in there in
[1:04:38] Calgary of Calgary and how it was the
[1:04:41] very first time a steam locomotive had
[1:04:44] come to town the very first time and
[1:04:46] they brought fresh oysters I think from
[1:04:48] the East Coast all the way to Calgary
[1:04:51] the very first train that ever made it
[1:04:52] to Calgary and everybody came out it was
[1:04:54] on a Sunday everybody who was able to
[1:04:58] anyways came out to see this train in
[1:04:59] the train yard and it was a fascinating
[1:05:01] thing and they had one picture a black
[1:05:03] and white picture of all the people and
[1:05:05] if you looked at all the people all you
[1:05:06] could see was people dressed in their
[1:05:08] very best and you didn't see women
[1:05:10] dressed wearing pants you saw women
[1:05:13] wearing dresses back in the 1900s you
[1:05:15] could look anywhere go and take a
[1:05:16] picture over in in Europe or in Africa
[1:05:19] or anywhere you go outside of maybe
[1:05:21] tribal dress you would see people women
[1:05:26] wearing garments that pertain to a woman
[1:05:28] and you would see men wearing garments
[1:05:30] that pertain to a man there was no
[1:05:32] confusion now the the blood the lines
[1:05:34] are so blurred you can't tell which is
[1:05:36] which and I mean we don't even need to
[1:05:38] get into gender I'm not going to do that
[1:05:40] but I just want to make the simple
[1:05:41] comparison we were talking the other day
[1:05:44] about uh sisters wearing garments that
[1:05:46] pertain to a man they're wearing jeans
[1:05:47] blue jeans I grew up with girls wearing
[1:05:49] blue jeans it was normal for me in my
[1:05:52] life to see it everywhere and and it was
[1:05:54] shocking for me to see that there was
[1:05:56] there was people that just sisters
[1:05:58] females just didn't wear pants I was
[1:06:01] like what kind of thing is that but
[1:06:03] we're able to take it back to the word
[1:06:04] of God then I was able to say okay amen
[1:06:07] I'll just take it by faith that's what
[1:06:08] the word of God says that's what I'm
[1:06:09] going to follow amen but you know
[1:06:12] talking to this brother the other day he
[1:06:13] said you know talking to a a girl
[1:06:15] wearing pants and having the discussion
[1:06:16] just an open free conversation you're
[1:06:19] not supposed to wear garments that
[1:06:20] pertain to a man that's what the word of
[1:06:22] God says she says I'm not he's like well
[1:06:24] you're wearing blue jeans she says well
[1:06:26] these blue jeans are female blue jeans
[1:06:28] they're jeans for a
[1:06:31] girl that's how blurry the lines are
[1:06:34] isn't it it's the world in which we live
[1:06:36] in we need to know what's what we need
[1:06:39] to know exactly where we stand what is a
[1:06:41] garment that pertains to a man I'm not
[1:06:43] going to go too far into that today but
[1:06:45] I want to say this it's in the word of
[1:06:47] God just like not cutting your hair as a
[1:06:49] sister is in the word of God now those
[1:06:51] are two natural outwardly Expressions
[1:06:54] that are so a parent and a sister
[1:06:57] Brothers we need to pray for our
[1:06:59] sisters they're moving Targets in this
[1:07:01] world they walk in this world and
[1:07:03] everybody looks at them everybody does
[1:07:06] but you know I think that standard is
[1:07:08] interesting to see on a sister how
[1:07:11] important it is and how we harp on it I
[1:07:14] want to take it now and look at the
[1:07:16] other side of the coin let's talk about
[1:07:17] the brothers now I don't want to talk
[1:07:19] about clothes because I'm not worried
[1:07:21] about clothes in a brother I think get
[1:07:23] the Holy Ghost but what's standard are
[1:07:26] we living as brothers are we living a
[1:07:29] scriptural standard in our lives because
[1:07:32] the sisters are looking for leadership
[1:07:35] they're not looking for equals they're
[1:07:37] not looking for someone on an even Keel
[1:07:39] that's that's not going to challenge
[1:07:41] them they're looking for true leadership
[1:07:43] according to the word of
[1:07:44] God as brothers as husbands as future
[1:07:48] husbands is that what we are doing is
[1:07:51] that what we're being taught in our
[1:07:53] lives or is it just LAX isical is it
[1:07:57] just as we go we're
[1:08:00] equal we're not equal it's not because
[1:08:03] the man is greater it's because the man
[1:08:05] has a greater responsibility he's
[1:08:07] responsible for the children he's
[1:08:08] responsible for the wife he's
[1:08:10] responsible for the entire family's
[1:08:12] actions
[1:08:14] amen God did not come down in the Garden
[1:08:16] of Eden and say Eve Eve Where Art
[1:08:22] Thou fully knowing who she was and where
[1:08:25] they were
[1:08:26] knowing where they were hiding he came
[1:08:27] down and said Adam where are you because
[1:08:31] Adam is the one that was responsible Eve
[1:08:34] was a part of
[1:08:35] Adam Adam complete responsibility for
[1:08:39] her his responsibility to make sure that
[1:08:42] standard was upheld in the Garden of
[1:08:43] Eden we can eat from any single tree in
[1:08:45] the garden Eve any tree do you know that
[1:08:47] God never came down and said to Eve you
[1:08:49] can't eat from every tree in the garden
[1:08:50] he came down and told that to
[1:08:53] Adam and if you take it from the
[1:08:55] scriptural perspective from the Insight
[1:08:57] of a prophet it was actually while they
[1:09:00] were yet one the feminist was still
[1:09:03] inside of Adam so perhaps she being he
[1:09:08] inside of him heard it but you can rest
[1:09:11] assured that he spoke it that Adam said
[1:09:14] to her we can have whatever we want in
[1:09:16] this Garden except for
[1:09:19] that and we know that while she was in
[1:09:21] Adam there was no temptation there was
[1:09:25] no no issue no problem as long as she
[1:09:28] was under the leadership of her husband
[1:09:29] while she was yet inside of him but as
[1:09:32] soon as she actually came out from him
[1:09:34] as soon as she was exposed my then Satan
[1:09:37] came around then Satan came and actually
[1:09:40] tried to mess with that standard that
[1:09:42] was
[1:09:43] set Isaiah 59 so shall they fear the
[1:09:47] name of the Lord from the West and his
[1:09:50] glory from the rising of the sun when
[1:09:52] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:09:54] spirit of the Lord
[1:09:56] shall lift up a standard against
[1:09:59] him I just want to try and encourage us
[1:10:01] today brothers and sisters I'm not doing
[1:10:03] this as a Sunday school to teach us I'm
[1:10:06] doing it maybe as a little bit of
[1:10:07] preaching just to encourage us there is
[1:10:09] a standard that's raised as we live in
[1:10:12] this world and we see how dark this
[1:10:14] world is getting we see how terrible
[1:10:17] things are getting and you know what
[1:10:19] unfortunately the the Outlook looks Grim
[1:10:22] it's not going to get a whole lot better
[1:10:23] naturally speaking in this world until
[1:10:26] there is a a a renovation of this entire
[1:10:29] world it's going to keep spiraling down
[1:10:32] and down and down darker and darker and
[1:10:34] darker and as we go you know how dark
[1:10:36] it's getting it's terrible and tragic we
[1:10:38] can keep talking like that but what I
[1:10:40] want to do today is trying and encourage
[1:10:42] us that the darker it gets the brighter
[1:10:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:46] shines not just to stand out as a Target
[1:10:50] brother brandom he says it you know what
[1:10:51] happens what'll happen right at the end
[1:10:54] of days
[1:10:55] it'll be a short powerful
[1:10:58] demonstration of the power of God to his
[1:11:00] bride there's going to be a persecution
[1:11:03] against the church and it's already
[1:11:06] happening it's the age in which we live
[1:11:09] in the prophet in uh Israel and the
[1:11:12] church in
[1:11:13] 1953 I know this goes back a long
[1:11:17] ways but uh I just think the thought is
[1:11:20] good you know he says no wonder
[1:11:21] Christianity can't even lift up a
[1:11:23] standard it's because
[1:11:25] not because Christ is not able it's not
[1:11:29] because Christ is not able brothers and
[1:11:31] sisters but because that the people
[1:11:33] won't do
[1:11:35] it it just made me think about it you
[1:11:37] know we can have all kinds of things in
[1:11:39] our lives all kinds of reasons I'm
[1:11:42] certainly thankful that brother Ken he
[1:11:43] taught you know I I I think it's a
[1:11:46] beautiful thing you know any excuse is
[1:11:48] good enough when you really don't want
[1:11:49] to do
[1:11:51] something but the Ken used to say that
[1:11:53] all the time any excuse is good enough
[1:11:56] when you really don't want to do
[1:11:58] it no wonder Christianity can't even
[1:12:00] lift up a standard it's because not
[1:12:03] because Christ is not able but because
[1:12:05] the people won't do it the message is
[1:12:09] ready here we are in 19 when
[1:12:13] 53 before the seals back when he was a
[1:12:17] prophet the message is ready the power
[1:12:20] of God is
[1:12:21] sufficient men and women are scared to
[1:12:24] break out yawn
[1:12:25] into those spheres before God and dare
[1:12:28] to trust him to take him at his
[1:12:31] word I want to challenge us today I want
[1:12:33] to encourage us today don't be afraid
[1:12:36] Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters to
[1:12:38] break out yonder into those fears before
[1:12:40] God and dare to trust him to take him at
[1:12:43] his word how do you do that break out of
[1:12:46] the ordinary you know what if you want
[1:12:48] to see different results in your lives
[1:12:49] brothers and sisters speaking of myself
[1:12:51] I know this if I want to see different
[1:12:53] results in my life I got to do things
[1:12:54] different it's that simple if I just
[1:12:56] keep going on doing the same thing over
[1:12:58] and over and over again hoping for a
[1:12:59] different result that's the definition
[1:13:01] of
[1:13:01] insanity if I want to see the power of
[1:13:03] God move if I want to break out into
[1:13:05] those other places then I need to do
[1:13:07] something different and you know what
[1:13:08] the prophet said the thing that we will
[1:13:10] never do enough of is
[1:13:12] pray if we want to see God move in our
[1:13:15] lives we got to be willing to make a
[1:13:16] sacrifice in our life and that sacrifice
[1:13:19] isn't just saying you know I'm going to
[1:13:21] offer some money and say you know that's
[1:13:23] my tithe and my offering and you know
[1:13:25] God is good I'm not just going to turn
[1:13:27] up on a Sunday and say I'm just G to put
[1:13:29] my shoulder to the wheel and I'm gonna
[1:13:30] sing The Gospel we've got to have a
[1:13:32] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:34] ourselves
[1:13:38] personally men and women are scared to
[1:13:41] break out yonder into those spheres is
[1:13:44] anybody scared here today you don't have
[1:13:46] to raise your hand you know what it's a
[1:13:48] real thing I want to say fear is a real
[1:13:51] thing it's a big thing that we're
[1:13:52] contending with today just like anxiety
[1:13:55] the devil doesn't want to be exposed so
[1:13:58] he's going to grip your heart with
[1:14:00] fear and tell you it's not going to
[1:14:03] happen if you step out into those fears
[1:14:05] then then everybody's going to look at
[1:14:07] you and say oh look at that fanatic look
[1:14:09] at I always knew that he was a little
[1:14:10] bit weird he's always been a little bit
[1:14:13] funny that guy stepping out into those
[1:14:15] fears that sister who has always maybe
[1:14:17] cried or or or sang a little bit loud
[1:14:20] acted just a little bit funny that's the
[1:14:21] devil
[1:14:23] talking do it anyway amen the prophet of
[1:14:26] God says if you fear
[1:14:28] something just go the opposite way it
[1:14:32] just go the opposite way if you don't
[1:14:33] know or you don't like what you see just
[1:14:35] do the
[1:14:37] Opposites give the devil something to
[1:14:40] fear don't don't let him see you fear
[1:14:43] give the devil something to fear you
[1:14:45] want to do something different I didn't
[1:14:47] make any announcements I'll say it
[1:14:49] tonight or this morning there's a prayer
[1:14:50] meeting Thursday night at the church
[1:14:53] here at 7:30 you want to do something
[1:14:55] different come to a prayer meeting and
[1:14:57] see if God won't actually come on the
[1:14:59] scene for your needs when we get
[1:15:01] together and we pray we get together and
[1:15:04] we bring forth the need before the body
[1:15:05] before the few people that gather and we
[1:15:08] actually pray together for that need so
[1:15:11] that God will come on the scene and
[1:15:12] intercede many times people will say oh
[1:15:14] brother Barry I I pray in my prayer
[1:15:17] closet and that's where my success
[1:15:18] happens if that's all it is then that's
[1:15:20] great God bless you but if you want to
[1:15:22] see more there's more to have amen I
[1:15:25] want to tell you there's something that
[1:15:27] happens you know this word standard out
[1:15:30] of strongs concordance
[1:15:34] 5127 it says to subside to escape to
[1:15:40] causatively chase impel
[1:15:42] deliver a baate a way be
[1:15:45] displayed all kinds of descriptive words
[1:15:47] here the end of it I think really kind
[1:15:49] of makes the sense the most is to be
[1:15:53] displayed make to flee put to flight to
[1:15:59] hide to lift up a standard and remember
[1:16:03] brothers and sisters we can only go so
[1:16:06] far with the standard we can only go so
[1:16:09] far when we try and actually uphold the
[1:16:12] standard what we do is we actually take
[1:16:15] away the power of God not that we can
[1:16:18] ever take away the power of God we'll
[1:16:19] never diminish God but he's looking for
[1:16:21] hands he's looking for feet he's looking
[1:16:24] for bodies that he can work through amen
[1:16:26] but if we're not willing to come
[1:16:27] according to his word then his standard
[1:16:30] isn't going to be upheld by him he's
[1:16:32] going to say I'll just wait until you're
[1:16:34] ready and as soon as you're ready I will
[1:16:37] know because of your actions your
[1:16:40] actions will show when you're ready your
[1:16:42] words are one thing but your actual
[1:16:45] actions display another thing I think
[1:16:48] it's so beautiful how he will actually
[1:16:51] do it you know looking at the story of
[1:16:53] the Ducks brother randam tells the story
[1:16:55] the Ducks we're all familiar with it I'm
[1:16:56] not going to talk too far about it
[1:17:00] today but I just have two comparisons
[1:17:03] you know one of them is of the Ducks the
[1:17:04] story of the Ducks how the the man the
[1:17:06] farmer was Raising ducks and he had a
[1:17:09] pond or a stream maybe a pond by the
[1:17:11] stream and he had them segregated into
[1:17:14] different sections with fences and they
[1:17:16] were all there there were different
[1:17:17] breeds of ducks maybe they were the same
[1:17:19] breed of duck and and they were all just
[1:17:21] there but they couldn't really
[1:17:22] Fellowship together because the fences
[1:17:24] were in the way but you know what
[1:17:25] happened was the the flood came in and
[1:17:28] what happened when that flood came in
[1:17:29] the water Rose and those fences
[1:17:31] disappeared and as soon as the fences
[1:17:33] disappeared the Ducks they could have
[1:17:35] Fellowship one with another just an
[1:17:37] interesting little story another one
[1:17:38] that he talks about is the story of the
[1:17:40] Corn growing in the fields you can see
[1:17:42] the different Farmers Fields he talks
[1:17:44] about a man flying in an airplane over
[1:17:46] top of the corn fields you can see the
[1:17:48] different fields all along the way and
[1:17:51] you know as they would fly over and
[1:17:52] check the crops over the year there came
[1:17:54] a point point in time where there was no
[1:17:56] longer any fences visible why was that
[1:17:59] because the corn started to mature as it
[1:18:02] grew it grew together and it grew over
[1:18:04] top of the fences and it actually
[1:18:06] blocked out the fences and you couldn't
[1:18:08] see any division amongst
[1:18:11] them and I think that's what's happening
[1:18:13] today in in the world in which we live
[1:18:16] in as spiritual Believers we can look
[1:18:19] around in this world and and naturally
[1:18:20] speaking not say that that's what's
[1:18:22] happening it is happening when you look
[1:18:24] at the world world and how evil it's
[1:18:25] getting it's getting more and more evil
[1:18:27] and there's way
[1:18:29] less definition between the camps it's
[1:18:32] either evil or it's good that's the way
[1:18:34] it's going and I mean if you want to
[1:18:36] really nail it down we could simply say
[1:18:38] this how many parties in the province of
[1:18:40] Alberta political parties just in the
[1:18:42] province of Alberta are not supporting
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:48] lgbtq
[1:18:49] communities which political party could
[1:18:52] you vote for today that would say I take
[1:18:54] stand against it and I will not actually
[1:18:57] allow it there's not one political party
[1:18:59] all of them support it so doesn't matter
[1:19:04] what way we go my point is it's dark
[1:19:07] spiritually speaking it's dark there's
[1:19:08] nothing we can do about it but you know
[1:19:10] what I want to talk about today brothers
[1:19:12] and sisters is not actually a
[1:19:14] restoration uh a a Reformation I want to
[1:19:17] talk about the restoration the
[1:19:18] restoration is to actually take us
[1:19:21] somewhere to bring us back to a a a word
[1:19:24] of God uh a complete word of God we know
[1:19:26] that the Restoration in the age in which
[1:19:28] we live in took us back to the true
[1:19:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost before that
[1:19:33] there was many people thinking they were
[1:19:35] getting baptized and and receiving the
[1:19:37] true baptism of the holy spirit in their
[1:19:39] lives but they they maybe weren't able
[1:19:42] to because the word of God was actually
[1:19:44] not being applied correctly in their
[1:19:46] lives I wouldn't doubt for a second that
[1:19:48] there was people being baptized in the
[1:19:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ before
[1:19:52] William Mary and brandham came on the
[1:19:54] scene and that they were truly receiving
[1:19:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I would
[1:19:58] not diminish that because the baptism of
[1:20:00] the Holy Ghost was given on the day of
[1:20:02] Pentecost and brother bradam even said
[1:20:03] it when did the apostolic age cease
[1:20:07] because there's people today that
[1:20:08] believe the apostolic age ceased he said
[1:20:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given
[1:20:12] at Pentecost in the upper room and it
[1:20:16] hasn't been taken away amen but what's
[1:20:18] happened is Satan we've read it very
[1:20:20] clearly in the exposition of the seven
[1:20:21] Church ages how Satan has come in and
[1:20:24] through politics and and and all the
[1:20:26] different isms inside the churches what
[1:20:28] he's done is he's eroded people's faith
[1:20:31] and that's the way the devil Works he
[1:20:32] comes in and he erodes people's Faith
[1:20:35] it's interesting when you go to a river
[1:20:36] and you look at a river how the river
[1:20:38] banks are and how they work you can look
[1:20:40] around and you can see man everything is
[1:20:42] eroded in here but it's just a trickling
[1:20:44] little stream at the bottom how can that
[1:20:46] be there's a time once in a while where
[1:20:48] the enemy the water comes in like a
[1:20:50] flood and it's a deluge and it just
[1:20:52] absolutely reshapes
[1:20:55] everything the devil is always at work
[1:20:57] he's completely continually trying to
[1:20:59] erode the faith of the Believers and we
[1:21:02] know that he has time on his side that's
[1:21:04] why he does it that way he can do just a
[1:21:06] little bit today just a little bit
[1:21:08] tomorrow just a little bit next week
[1:21:10] just a little bit 10 years from now just
[1:21:12] a little bit here and a little bit there
[1:21:14] and what happens is before long we're
[1:21:17] away from the original word that is what
[1:21:19] the restoration of the word in our day
[1:21:21] brought it brought the opening of the
[1:21:23] seals it brought the complete
[1:21:26] understanding of the word in our day I'm
[1:21:27] not going to go too far into that but
[1:21:29] what I want to talk about is this this
[1:21:31] Reformation brought us to a place of
[1:21:35] restoration the restoration brought us
[1:21:38] to the place of the true baptism of the
[1:21:40] Holy Ghost we read that in the book here
[1:21:42] um the exposition of the church ages
[1:21:44] brother Ram says why listen to me the
[1:21:45] reason for being justified Sanctified is
[1:21:48] to the end that you might have the
[1:21:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost that you might
[1:21:52] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost why
[1:21:55] would we want to have the baptism of the
[1:21:56] Holy Ghost we would want to have the
[1:21:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that we
[1:21:59] could be changed ourselves amen right so
[1:22:03] that we would no longer be the same
[1:22:04] people that we used to be I used to
[1:22:06] smoke I used to drink I used to listen
[1:22:09] to nasty stuff I used to watch nasty
[1:22:12] stuff I used to be a part of this world
[1:22:14] but you know what something happened to
[1:22:16] me somewhere along the way God came into
[1:22:19] my life and changed me he did not reform
[1:22:22] me he didn't show me how to conform but
[1:22:25] he showed me how to transform we know
[1:22:28] the word of God says I beseech you
[1:22:30] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:22:33] that you present your bodies a Living
[1:22:35] Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God
[1:22:37] which is your reasonable service that's
[1:22:40] what we need to do is say Lord I am here
[1:22:43] I am ready fill me with your spirit
[1:22:48] Lord he goes on to say and be not
[1:22:51] conformed to this world and I want to
[1:22:53] say don't be conformed to the world but
[1:22:55] don't just come in through the doors and
[1:22:57] be conformed to a
[1:22:59] church be not conformed to this world
[1:23:02] but be ye
[1:23:04] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:23:07] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:23:10] acceptable and perfect will of God how
[1:23:13] are we ever going to prove that by
[1:23:16] simply living it that's how we're going
[1:23:19] to prove it brothers and sisters people
[1:23:21] around us will say who are you and what
[1:23:23] have you done with Buddy what have you
[1:23:24] done with that that man what have you
[1:23:26] done with that sister why are you so
[1:23:28] different what is it about
[1:23:30] you and you know what it is sometimes
[1:23:33] you hear what what is it about you
[1:23:35] people wow there's something something
[1:23:37] about us you ask me why I'm happy so
[1:23:41] I'll just tell you why it's because I
[1:23:42] know my sins are
[1:23:44] gone I know where they are they're
[1:23:47] underneath that bumper of blood that was
[1:23:50] shed at
[1:23:52] Calvary you know there were reformers
[1:23:54] they brought Reformation the ability to
[1:23:57] live in a condition they they they they
[1:24:00] we even see people today like I said
[1:24:02] earlier you know a military school oh
[1:24:04] thank the Lord that I didn't go
[1:24:07] there I didn't I didn't need to learn
[1:24:09] how to live in the condition which I was
[1:24:12] in I needed to to to learn that there
[1:24:14] was a deliverer from the condition that
[1:24:16] I was in I I didn't want to learn just
[1:24:19] to accept what's around me so that I
[1:24:21] could say that I just have to accept
[1:24:23] these genetics that I've been given in
[1:24:25] my life and all of the shortcomings of
[1:24:28] my world that's just something I have to
[1:24:30] accept and live with
[1:24:32] my no no we know brother Bram he taught
[1:24:36] the story about justification and
[1:24:38] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:24:40] Holy Ghost and uh he used the example of
[1:24:43] how you can have a chicken yard and if
[1:24:45] anybody knows what I'm talking about we
[1:24:47] use this example a lot we have chickens
[1:24:49] at home but if you have a chicken yard
[1:24:51] it's pretty disgusting where the
[1:24:52] chickens live they're not really clean
[1:24:55] creatures and excuse me in the chicken
[1:24:59] yard you can have a cup you can have a
[1:25:01] coffee cup maybe your favorite shiny
[1:25:04] coffee mug and and go and set it just
[1:25:06] set it on the chicken yard for a little
[1:25:08] while and see what happens if you left
[1:25:09] it maybe excuse me over the winter you
[1:25:12] would see that by Springtime that
[1:25:14] chicken chicken yard would probably have
[1:25:16] it just half covered and and maybe
[1:25:18] manure and and dirt just by the way they
[1:25:21] get in there and they scratch and they
[1:25:22] make such a mess and some rain come and
[1:25:25] and splatters mud on it and that cup
[1:25:27] would soon not be worthy of use that
[1:25:29] that cup would be written off you'd be
[1:25:31] like I'm never going to drink out of
[1:25:32] that cup again maybe I would scoop some
[1:25:34] food or something with it for the
[1:25:36] chickens but that's it but you know
[1:25:38] brother Bram using the example of a cup
[1:25:39] in the chicken yard how that cup can be
[1:25:41] there and and justification is an
[1:25:44] example of someone coming and picking
[1:25:46] that cup up from the chicken yard it's
[1:25:48] no longer there just left rotting in the
[1:25:51] chicken yard being mistreated being
[1:25:53] abused being made filthy and and that's
[1:25:56] an example of justification in this
[1:25:59] world when we become Justified we're no
[1:26:01] longer just in this world in the manure
[1:26:04] pile we're kind of set aside and and
[1:26:07] we're just taken up from that sinful
[1:26:09] place that we were in but then the
[1:26:11] sanctification is the sanitization
[1:26:14] that's how I was able to remember it
[1:26:16] that cup was taken and soaked in a bowl
[1:26:19] of bleach and after it had soaked for
[1:26:21] maybe a couple of weeks in that bleach
[1:26:23] completely immersed all the germs being
[1:26:25] killed from it the sanctification
[1:26:27] process take it out now and boil it in a
[1:26:29] bowl in a pot on the stove and and you
[1:26:32] boil all of the other stuff out of it
[1:26:34] and then maybe once all that's done you
[1:26:36] take it and put it in the sanitized
[1:26:38] cycle in the dishwasher and you now you
[1:26:40] have that cup that is Justified it's
[1:26:42] picked up out of the manure then you
[1:26:44] take it and it gets sanitized it becomes
[1:26:47] Sanctified it gets all of the nasty
[1:26:50] filth burned out of it it's cleaned out
[1:26:52] of it it's completely sanctified but
[1:26:54] then you don't leave it there if you
[1:26:57] leave it there something's going to fill
[1:26:58] that cup something will fill that cup
[1:27:01] and sometimes I think that can be to the
[1:27:03] detriment of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:05] God they come to the place where they
[1:27:07] recognize I'm no longer who I used to be
[1:27:09] my goodness I am sanitized I am really
[1:27:12] good in my condition I've never felt so
[1:27:14] good I've never looked so good but you
[1:27:16] know what something's going to fill it
[1:27:19] the word of God talks about how when we
[1:27:22] are cleansed human beings are cleansed
[1:27:24] the temple has a devil cast out of it
[1:27:27] what happen that devil is going to go in
[1:27:30] Rome out in dry places and say man I
[1:27:33] remember that place that I was at that
[1:27:35] Sanctified cup is so beautiful it
[1:27:39] actually wouldn't be thinking that I'd
[1:27:39] be thinking about the filthy cup in the
[1:27:41] chicken yard but he'd be thinking about
[1:27:42] that place that he was at and then he's
[1:27:44] going to come back and take a look and
[1:27:46] see is there something in that cup if
[1:27:48] there's nothing in that cup then what's
[1:27:49] he going to do the word of God says that
[1:27:51] he'll jump right back in and he'll bring
[1:27:53] seven worse Devils than he had
[1:27:58] before
[1:28:00] Justified picked
[1:28:02] up Sanctified sanitized and set aside on
[1:28:07] for service just put back in the
[1:28:09] cupboard now this cup has a purpose I
[1:28:12] missed this cup it was down in the
[1:28:13] chicken yard and now it's saved again
[1:28:16] but you know it's no good it's no good
[1:28:19] you're just going to speak naturally
[1:28:21] unless you can take it and pull it out
[1:28:23] of the cupboard and fill it with coffee
[1:28:25] and use it or fill it with water or milk
[1:28:28] or whatever it is you drink but you know
[1:28:30] that's the example the prophet brought
[1:28:32] the cup Justified Sanctified but you
[1:28:35] know what we're talking about human
[1:28:36] beings we've got to be taken out of the
[1:28:38] manure pile we've got to be cleaned up
[1:28:40] and and sanitized in our lives we have
[1:28:43] to go from just recognizing a re
[1:28:46] reformation and a and a and a
[1:28:48] justification a restoration we need to
[1:28:50] go back to the original word and
[1:28:52] actually get the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost when we get that in our lives then
[1:28:57] we actually seal out all of the attacks
[1:29:01] of the enemy
[1:29:02] amen you know brother Ram he talked
[1:29:05] about it I think it's so important to to
[1:29:08] mention
[1:29:10] how the polarization of covid how people
[1:29:13] were so afraid that it was you know of
[1:29:16] the devil and everything was going on
[1:29:18] some were saying the Catholic Church all
[1:29:20] the conspiracy stuff and then even with
[1:29:22] the vaccine and the vaccine and Bill
[1:29:25] Gates and all the different conspiracy
[1:29:27] theories and everything going on I'm not
[1:29:29] a conspiracy theorist I'm not trying to
[1:29:31] bring that to us what I am trying to say
[1:29:33] is this people were saying that a shot
[1:29:36] in the arm is going to give you the mark
[1:29:38] of the beast in our day today even
[1:29:41] Believers were saying that it was
[1:29:43] designed to change you
[1:29:45] genetically we know that we had a
[1:29:48] prophet that said Mark 16 in action is
[1:29:50] the only true church and all else is
[1:29:53] false amen and I remember myself coming
[1:29:56] to the place with covid and I'm not
[1:29:58] trying to say anything about me this is
[1:30:00] just my own Revelation some people might
[1:30:03] be getting grossed out right about now
[1:30:04] but just bear with me for a second I I
[1:30:06] recognize the only way we're going to
[1:30:07] get our doors open here on the church is
[1:30:09] to roll up our sleeves and say we're
[1:30:11] willing to get a vaccine so I said you
[1:30:13] know what Mark 16 in action I'll roll up
[1:30:16] my sleeve give me a shot go ahead I'll
[1:30:19] take the shot because if it's going to
[1:30:21] kill me then I'm only going to go to
[1:30:23] heaven I'm not going to die the prophet
[1:30:26] of God said the mark of the beast is
[1:30:29] already in
[1:30:30] us we can't reject it the mark of the
[1:30:34] beast is actually to reject the baptism
[1:30:37] of the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the
[1:30:40] beast and you know there's coming a day
[1:30:42] sure enough there is there's coming a
[1:30:44] day where they're going to put a chip or
[1:30:45] whatever they're going to do something
[1:30:46] in the hand something in the forehead I
[1:30:48] believe that with all my heart but the
[1:30:50] Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be
[1:30:51] long gone because she recognized what
[1:30:52] the prophet of God said
[1:30:54] he said the mark of the beast is not
[1:30:57] what we think it is the mark in the back
[1:30:59] of the hand is actually the action to
[1:31:01] the thought in the forehead of the human
[1:31:04] being that's the mark of the beast
[1:31:06] spiritually speaking there's always a
[1:31:08] spiritual type before the natural
[1:31:10] because the natural types the spiritual
[1:31:12] there will be a time with the mark of
[1:31:14] the beast don't get me wrong but I just
[1:31:17] want to say we don't have to worry about
[1:31:19] that if we go and get filled with the
[1:31:20] Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost all we have to do is get the
[1:31:24] baptism of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:31:26] and you know it's the person of Jesus
[1:31:28] Christ it's his very life living out
[1:31:31] through us the person of Jesus it's not
[1:31:35] the second or the third person of a
[1:31:36] trinity it's the person God himself his
[1:31:40] manifestation in flesh that's how God
[1:31:43] chose to represent himself to the body
[1:31:46] and you know it's fine to talk about him
[1:31:48] in theory but I just want to say and
[1:31:51] it's kind of where I was feeling about
[1:31:53] the enemy com in like a flood the spirit
[1:31:55] of God raises a standard against it but
[1:31:57] you know it's fine to talk about it in
[1:31:59] theory but what about us today where are
[1:32:02] we at today can we say for sure I know I
[1:32:07] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:32:09] not looking for a show of hands what I
[1:32:11] am looking for is Honest Hearts I want
[1:32:14] to know if we're looking inside our
[1:32:16] hearts and saying yes I know brother
[1:32:18] Barry I know it I know I got the holy
[1:32:20] ghost in my life or no I just don't know
[1:32:22] brother Barry if I got the Holy Ghost in
[1:32:24] my life I believe this is God crying out
[1:32:26] in the final days of the final age you
[1:32:29] have the opportunity to get the Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost if you want
[1:32:33] them it's not brother Barry crying out
[1:32:36] you can say it is oh it's just brother
[1:32:38] Barry
[1:32:40] okay but is it where are we at what are
[1:32:43] we doing brothers and sisters 1954 the
[1:32:46] end time brother Bram says you always
[1:32:48] talk about how bad the world is how
[1:32:50] Wicked the world
[1:32:52] is that's
[1:32:57] true my goodness we're only just 20
[1:32:59] after 11 here I was feeling guilty like
[1:33:03] we're 20 after 12 my we got lots of time
[1:33:07] Hallelujah you always talk about how bad
[1:33:09] the world is how Wicked the world is
[1:33:12] that's true but look how great the
[1:33:14] church is getting all the time we fail
[1:33:17] to look at that side brothers and
[1:33:19] sisters let's not fail to look at that
[1:33:21] side that's where I want to say if we do
[1:33:23] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:33:25] got nothing to fear there's nothing in
[1:33:27] this world that we need to fear there's
[1:33:29] no person there's no government there's
[1:33:32] no issue no problem everything can be
[1:33:35] resolved in such a supernatural way that
[1:33:38] we never even imagine it could be
[1:33:41] resolved but we're moving into this
[1:33:43] place where brother Ram is talking about
[1:33:46] the world is getting dark and dark
[1:33:48] darker and darker but look how great the
[1:33:50] church is getting all the time some
[1:33:52] people here might say say yeah well
[1:33:54] where's all the signs and wonders I can
[1:33:57] tell you I've witnessed some very
[1:33:58] Supernatural things just me how about
[1:34:01] you you ever seen the power of God come
[1:34:04] into your life in such a way that you
[1:34:06] could never have imagined when the
[1:34:08] spirit the enemy has come into your life
[1:34:11] like a flood has not the spirit of Lord
[1:34:13] raised up a standard against that
[1:34:17] enemy he says that's true but look how
[1:34:19] great the church is getting all the time
[1:34:21] we fail to look at that side Jesus said
[1:34:23] let them grow together he's talking
[1:34:25] about the two
[1:34:27] Vines when the world's getting wickeder
[1:34:30] and wickeder and wickeder the church is
[1:34:32] getting more powerful and more powerful
[1:34:36] all the time the enemy comes in like a
[1:34:38] flood the spirit of God will raise up a
[1:34:41] standard against it Hallelujah let's go
[1:34:44] Glory the winds are blowing set your
[1:34:47] sails Hallelujah move right into the
[1:34:50] face of the storm what human nature says
[1:34:55] I want to run inside I want to run into
[1:34:58] that strong
[1:35:00] tower I want to find that place that's
[1:35:02] out of the wind no no that's not what
[1:35:04] we're instructed to do we're instructed
[1:35:07] to set our sail plant our Rudder and go
[1:35:09] right into the face of the
[1:35:11] storm move into the face of the storm
[1:35:14] what do you care who's the
[1:35:17] captain and that's where I want to say
[1:35:19] when I see folks getting really upset
[1:35:21] and really really really up upset over
[1:35:24] situations who's the captain in your
[1:35:27] boat did you forget that Jesus is in the
[1:35:30] back just having a nap go wake Jesus
[1:35:34] call him on the
[1:35:35] scene who's your captain he will take
[1:35:39] care of it now don't fear I'm always
[1:35:42] there
[1:35:43] see remember brothers and sisters it's
[1:35:46] not our spirit that's going to raise up
[1:35:49] the
[1:35:50] standard and many times I think that's
[1:35:52] what we try we try to raise up the
[1:35:56] standard in our lives in our homes Even
[1:35:58] in our churches brothers and sisters we
[1:36:00] can be the ones that say oh my I I can
[1:36:03] see this is wrong and we need to do this
[1:36:04] another way why don't we allow the
[1:36:08] spirit of the Lord to come on the scene
[1:36:10] and actually make the changes that need
[1:36:12] to
[1:36:14] happen 1956 the junction of
[1:36:18] time and now notice again that not only
[1:36:23] that
[1:36:24] when all hell turns loose all Heaven
[1:36:27] turns loose
[1:36:29] also all Heaven turns loose
[1:36:32] also when the enemy comes in like a
[1:36:35] flood the spirit of God raises up a
[1:36:37] standard against it and these two
[1:36:41] forces is always showed at the
[1:36:44] junction that's why I think you know as
[1:36:48] terrible as it is when something
[1:36:49] terrible is going on as a Believer I
[1:36:52] look at the situ now and I can say you
[1:36:55] know what the Lord is actually
[1:36:58] moving this is not just Satan doing his
[1:37:01] thing many times we can look at it and
[1:37:03] say oh the devil the devil the
[1:37:05] devil excuse me but we need to keep
[1:37:07] saying or start saying the Lord the Lord
[1:37:10] the Lord Satan can't do nothing unless
[1:37:13] he first gets permission from the Lord
[1:37:16] the devil's going out around as a
[1:37:17] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:37:20] we know that's the scripture but we know
[1:37:23] that nothing happens unless God first
[1:37:26] allows it there's nothing that the devil
[1:37:29] can do God is never
[1:37:33] surprised I think this verse 17 of
[1:37:36] Isaiah
[1:37:37] 59 is just beautiful 17 and 18 how he
[1:37:40] explains this here for he put on
[1:37:43] righteousness as a breastplate the Lord
[1:37:46] Jesus put on
[1:37:48] righteousness he put it on we didn't put
[1:37:51] it on our our righteousness is like a
[1:37:54] filthy rag it's but a filthy rag before
[1:37:57] him he put on righteousness as a
[1:37:59] breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[1:38:02] upon his head and he put on the garments
[1:38:06] of Vengeance for clothing and was clad
[1:38:09] with Zeal as a cloak and we know that
[1:38:12] this is right out of Ephesians chapter 6
[1:38:15] maybe we should turn over there just for
[1:38:17] the the sake of a little study
[1:38:20] today Hebrews chapter 6
[1:38:24] is it sorry it's Ephesians I said
[1:38:26] Hebrews I don't know why I said
[1:38:28] that Ephesians chapter
[1:38:36] 6
[1:38:38] Ephesians chapter
[1:38:41] 6 this is where I think the word of God
[1:38:44] is so wonderful because some folks would
[1:38:47] say it's contrary but we know by the
[1:38:49] spirit that it never contradicts the
[1:38:52] word of God is always always in
[1:38:56] course verse 10 of Ephesians chapter
[1:38:59] 6 Paul speaking to the Ephesian church
[1:39:02] he says finally my brethren be strong in
[1:39:04] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:39:08] amen put on the whole armor of God that
[1:39:11] you may be able to stand against the Ws
[1:39:15] of the
[1:39:16] devil now I just want to say how are we
[1:39:19] ever going to put on the armor of God
[1:39:21] there's no way that as human beings
[1:39:23] we're ever going to put on the armor of
[1:39:24] God we can we can we know that we've
[1:39:26] seen it in Sunday school it's a
[1:39:28] wonderful uh depiction how you can have
[1:39:30] the sword of the spirit and the helmet
[1:39:32] of salvation you can have the
[1:39:35] breastplate of righteousness you can
[1:39:36] have all these different things that
[1:39:37] we're going to read about here and as a
[1:39:40] as a Believer we can't just go and and
[1:39:42] get one of those from our church we
[1:39:44] can't just talk to the kind old priest
[1:39:46] or the pastor and and get one it's not
[1:39:48] us achieving another level in the word
[1:39:51] that gets us these things what gets us
[1:39:53] these things how do we put on the whole
[1:39:54] armor of God brothers and sisters it's a
[1:39:56] real simple answer you get filled with
[1:39:58] the Holy Ghost you get Jesus Christ the
[1:40:01] person of Jesus Christ in your life
[1:40:03] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:40:05] when that happens you put on the whole
[1:40:07] armor of God finally my brethren be
[1:40:10] strong in the Lord in the power of His
[1:40:12] might put on the whole armor of God that
[1:40:15] ye may be able to stand against the Ws
[1:40:18] of the devil so I want to say this
[1:40:21] without the whole armor of God you you
[1:40:22] ain't going to stand
[1:40:24] it's not going to be possible to
[1:40:25] withstand the Ws of the devil we will
[1:40:27] not do that why because we wrestle not
[1:40:29] against flesh and blood but it againsts
[1:40:31] principalities and
[1:40:33] Powers
[1:40:35] principalities are like a I heard a
[1:40:37] brother say it one time it's like a
[1:40:39] manager it's like a a company's manager
[1:40:42] that has a whole plethora of workers
[1:40:46] below him just waiting to do exactly
[1:40:48] what they're instructed a principality
[1:40:52] is someone that has a lot of workers so
[1:40:55] someone who has a lot of power and
[1:40:57] influence we are wrestling against
[1:40:59] principalities brothers and sisters
[1:41:01] against Powers against rulers of the
[1:41:04] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:41:07] wickedness in high
[1:41:10] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:41:12] armor of God we're instructed to do this
[1:41:14] take unto us the whole armor of God that
[1:41:16] ye may be able to withstand in the evil
[1:41:19] day and having done all to
[1:41:21] stand we come to a place where that
[1:41:24] standard is the threshold we can only
[1:41:26] just go that far on our own and it takes
[1:41:28] the Lord to take us Beyond there
[1:41:31] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:41:33] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:41:35] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:41:37] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:41:40] GED about with truth and having on the
[1:41:42] breastplate of
[1:41:43] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[1:41:46] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:41:48] above all taking the shield of Faith
[1:41:50] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[1:41:53] the fiery darts of the wicked and the
[1:41:56] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[1:41:59] spirit which is the word of
[1:42:02] God we have the whole armor of God that
[1:42:05] is actually spoken about by Paul the
[1:42:08] Apostle but he didn't just come up with
[1:42:10] this on his own the prophet Isaiah
[1:42:13] already spoke about it the prophet
[1:42:16] Isaiah brought it so shall they fear the
[1:42:20] name of the Lord from the West and His
[1:42:23] glory from the rising of the sun when
[1:42:25] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:42:26] spirit of the Lord shall raise up a
[1:42:28] standard against him it's just such a
[1:42:30] beautiful thing in 1956 the
[1:42:33] infallibility of God's spoken word he
[1:42:37] said and
[1:42:38] Joel in that day I'll pour out my spirit
[1:42:41] upon All Flesh and your young men shall
[1:42:45] see Visions upon my handmaids and my
[1:42:49] Maids will I pour out of my spirit
[1:42:54] he's not just going to pour out his
[1:42:56] Spirit maybe just from the pulpit I
[1:42:59] think that's such an important thing to
[1:43:00] recognize it's important for us to
[1:43:04] understand upon my handmaids and my
[1:43:06] Maids will I pour out my spirit I'll
[1:43:08] show signs in the heaven above flying
[1:43:10] saucers and
[1:43:11] everything when has there ever been so
[1:43:14] much talk about flying
[1:43:15] saucers about
[1:43:17] UFOs and whether the US government is
[1:43:19] going to release the information or not
[1:43:23] we know the prophet of God said they're
[1:43:24] investigating judgment angels and you
[1:43:27] know if you actually take those words
[1:43:28] and and you accept them and say wow
[1:43:30] that's what the prophet said okay that's
[1:43:32] interesting because how many sightings
[1:43:34] and announcements of the investigating
[1:43:36] judgment angels are there now it it's
[1:43:39] it's quite apparent that something is
[1:43:41] just about to happen in this
[1:43:43] world flying saucers and everything all
[1:43:45] kinds of Mystic signs in the heavens
[1:43:47] above signs on the earth
[1:43:50] below there will be a sea roaring
[1:43:53] tidal waves breaking along
[1:43:56] Chicago did you ever hear that before I
[1:43:59] had never heard that before tidal waves
[1:44:01] breaking along Chicago and that's on a
[1:44:04] great lake and all down along the places
[1:44:08] Great Sea a roaring men's heart failing
[1:44:11] perplex the time distress between
[1:44:14] nations oh
[1:44:16] my if you look at the distress between
[1:44:19] nations right now it is it's getting
[1:44:21] pretty tense out there
[1:44:24] it's getting pretty tense out there and
[1:44:27] in that day the great anointed church
[1:44:30] was to rise in her power and I want to
[1:44:33] say this in that day the great anointed
[1:44:38] church is to rise in her power and in
[1:44:43] that day the great anointed church is
[1:44:46] rising in her power it's not going to
[1:44:50] happen sometime it's not just History
[1:44:52] either Jesus Christ was to come in when
[1:44:54] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:44:56] spirit of God raises up a standard
[1:44:57] against it and today when science is
[1:44:59] doing all their different things than
[1:45:03] God sending down Supernatural signs to
[1:45:05] show his church take your mind off the
[1:45:08] things of the world and look
[1:45:12] up don't be looking at this world don't
[1:45:15] be looking at one another don't be
[1:45:17] looking at Great ministers on the earth
[1:45:19] here he doesn't want us to do that he
[1:45:22] wants us to look at him take your mind
[1:45:25] off the things of the world and look up
[1:45:29] I love this you're in the ladder now
[1:45:31] you're anchored both in glory and in
[1:45:33] heaven amen that latter has two ends to
[1:45:37] it amen you know this is out of the
[1:45:39] story Jacob Jacob's Ladder when Jacob he
[1:45:44] had left he didn't know where he was
[1:45:46] going he found a pillow and and he slept
[1:45:48] and he had a dream the pillow was a rock
[1:45:51] and we know that he had the the rock of
[1:45:54] Revelation in his life and he rested
[1:45:57] upon that rock but God showed him a
[1:45:59] vision of a ladder and he showed Angels
[1:46:02] ascending and descending on this ladder
[1:46:04] and that's what this is about the ladder
[1:46:06] has two ends to it amen one's Anchored
[1:46:08] In God the other one's Anchored In
[1:46:11] Christ amen and we're caught between it
[1:46:14] with a great host of angels bringing
[1:46:16] forth ministering Spirits Supernatural
[1:46:18] gifts and things vindicating we're on
[1:46:21] our road marching up isn't that a
[1:46:23] wonderful thought brothers and sisters
[1:46:25] if we believe this message if we have
[1:46:26] been Justified if we have been
[1:46:29] Sanctified if we have been filled with
[1:46:32] the Holy Ghost then you're on that
[1:46:33] ladder and you've got angels all around
[1:46:36] you we know the word says that his
[1:46:38] angels are encamped about those who fear
[1:46:40] Him amen those who fear Him follow his
[1:46:43] word amen it's not about being afraid of
[1:46:45] God and knocking your knees together
[1:46:47] when you hear thunder cracking because
[1:46:49] maybe someone said somewhere along the
[1:46:51] way that that's the power of God that's
[1:46:52] the the voice of God we know that in the
[1:46:54] Bible it said sometime the the the
[1:46:57] Thunder roared and some people said it
[1:46:59] was an angel and some people said it was
[1:47:01] God and we know the story but you know
[1:47:03] we don't need to be afraid in terms of
[1:47:05] scared run and hide no no that's the
[1:47:08] unbeliever the believer looks right into
[1:47:10] the face of judgment because we're
[1:47:12] judging ourselves here that we would be
[1:47:13] worthy there he said that if you confess
[1:47:16] my name here on Earth then I'll confess
[1:47:19] your name before my father over there
[1:47:24] you know this
[1:47:25] uh this idea that there is a standard to
[1:47:29] raise in our lives it goes
[1:47:31] beyond just having something that we do
[1:47:35] in our lives even though we do we we we
[1:47:38] simply follow the word of God we don't
[1:47:41] actually try and do something to say
[1:47:42] that I'm I'm truly Justified Now by my
[1:47:45] actions see my action doesn't it show
[1:47:48] who I am doesn't it show how much I
[1:47:50] believe the word of God no no no all of
[1:47:52] those things they just follow just like
[1:47:53] the signs and the
[1:47:55] Wonders when when we follow the word of
[1:47:58] God we truly create an atmosphere and
[1:48:01] and he begins living out through us we
[1:48:04] we don't actually get ahead of the word
[1:48:06] we follow the word and all the signs and
[1:48:08] wonders follow us when we follow the
[1:48:12] word out of spiritual adoption in
[1:48:16] 1956 brother Bram says if he will reveal
[1:48:18] to you this morning by the revelation
[1:48:23] that this is the end of your suffering
[1:48:27] this is the end of your
[1:48:29] sickness all Devils out of Torment will
[1:48:33] never Shake That
[1:48:35] Foundation though every doctors say it's
[1:48:39] wrong for Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:48:42] church and the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:48:45] Prevail against
[1:48:47] it though it would be against it yet it
[1:48:50] cannot Prevail for when the enemy comes
[1:48:53] in like a flood the spirit of God will
[1:48:55] raise a standard against it amen every
[1:48:59] time every single time brothers and
[1:49:02] sisters he says you see it you get it
[1:49:05] now Jesus being revealed to the
[1:49:09] disciples and it's interesting because
[1:49:13] we look at the the interpretation is a
[1:49:16] real important thing isn't it the the
[1:49:19] interpretation of the word the
[1:49:20] interpretation of Jesus we know that the
[1:49:24] disciples they were actually with Jesus
[1:49:27] one day and and he said to
[1:49:29] them you know who does the who who does
[1:49:32] the people the popular opinion what's
[1:49:34] the what's the word on the street who do
[1:49:36] they say that I am some said you know
[1:49:39] you're Elias or one of the prophets
[1:49:42] maybe
[1:49:43] jeremias and and we know that he said
[1:49:47] okay that's nice but who do you say that
[1:49:49] I am amen he brought it from the masses
[1:49:52] and brought it down to where we live and
[1:49:55] said who do you say that I am it's nice
[1:49:58] to know what everyone thinks out there
[1:50:00] but let's get specific about this who is
[1:50:03] it that you say that I am and we know
[1:50:06] that one of the disciples he stepped
[1:50:08] forward he stepped up and he spoke by
[1:50:11] Revelation in his life and he said Thou
[1:50:13] Art the Christ the son of the Living
[1:50:16] God and we know that Jesus being God in
[1:50:21] flesh he said
[1:50:23] Peter Simon bar Jonah flesh and blood
[1:50:27] has not revealed this unto you but my
[1:50:29] Father which is in heaven spoke directly
[1:50:32] to your heart and that that that word
[1:50:36] that was spoke to your heart it came to
[1:50:38] your mind and from your mind it traveled
[1:50:40] through all the neurons and it actually
[1:50:43] controlled your bodily functions and you
[1:50:45] spoke those words you actually put voice
[1:50:50] to the word that God put in your heart
[1:50:53] amen and we know the word of God says
[1:50:55] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:50:57] might not sin against thee that's not
[1:50:58] just saying that I went to Sunday school
[1:51:00] today and I got a good word and I just
[1:51:01] put it in there and now I'm good no no
[1:51:03] no no no it's about saying that I'm
[1:51:05] going to take every single word of God
[1:51:07] whether it takes my hide off me or not
[1:51:09] and I'm going to say Amen to that word
[1:51:10] of God Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:51:13] that I might not sin against thee but we
[1:51:15] know that that Peter was taken talking
[1:51:18] about interpretation the church has said
[1:51:20] wow that's the guy that we're going to
[1:51:22] build the church on we're going to build
[1:51:24] the whole entire church the whole
[1:51:25] Catholic Church all of Christendom will
[1:51:27] be built upon Peter and his great
[1:51:29] Revelation that happened there and isn't
[1:51:31] it interesting that how the devil will
[1:51:33] do that he'll take truth and spin it but
[1:51:36] then we have the restoration Prophet
[1:51:39] come on the scene and tie up the Loose
[1:51:41] Ends and say how could God build a
[1:51:43] church on a human being that's so
[1:51:46] unstable that he would actually Curse
[1:51:48] God he would curse he would actually
[1:51:51] swear and and Deni Jesus Just Like Jesus
[1:51:55] told them how how could God build his
[1:51:59] Church of the Living God on a man so
[1:52:02] unstable that would behave that way he
[1:52:03] never did but what did he build a church
[1:52:06] on he built a Church on the Rock of
[1:52:08] Revelation amen that a man would be able
[1:52:12] to follow the word of God to the place
[1:52:14] of being justified to the place of being
[1:52:17] Sanctified to the place of actually
[1:52:19] being filled with the Holy Ghost where
[1:52:21] he can now hear from God and God could
[1:52:24] speak directly to that man but you know
[1:52:26] it gets crazy when we talk like that
[1:52:28] because now you're getting out into
[1:52:30] those heavenlies that we spoke about a
[1:52:32] little earlier and people can get all
[1:52:34] kinds of interpretations just like the
[1:52:36] Catholic church can but you know what
[1:52:37] the difference is the True Believers are
[1:52:39] going to be right back with the original
[1:52:41] word amen and if it doesn't line up with
[1:52:44] the word when someone says hey buddy
[1:52:46] what do you mean by that sister you said
[1:52:48] that but what about the word that says
[1:52:50] this we're going to all say
[1:52:53] forgive me because I'm wrong and that
[1:52:55] word is right I'm going to take that
[1:52:57] word above every single thought above
[1:52:59] every single Revelation that I get
[1:53:02] because we know the Devil comes around
[1:53:03] and he likes to speak to our hearts
[1:53:05] too and he'll use 99% truth the devil
[1:53:09] will come and speak word in our ear
[1:53:11] don't think for a second the devil won't
[1:53:13] do that he will but he'll pervert it
[1:53:16] he'll twist it just a little bit and get
[1:53:18] us to try and think that that's God but
[1:53:21] it's going to line up exact with the
[1:53:22] word of God and if it doesn't brother
[1:53:24] bradam taught us just leave it alone
[1:53:26] just leave it alone it's not up to us to
[1:53:28] go and persecute we're not going to go
[1:53:30] and persecute someone because we don't
[1:53:32] see things the same way what we're going
[1:53:33] to do as Believers matured Believers
[1:53:35] those those stocks of corn that have
[1:53:38] grown way over top of the division of
[1:53:40] the fences because we're mature what
[1:53:43] we're going to do is go and pray for
[1:53:45] that brother or that
[1:53:47] sister the spirit of God will raise a
[1:53:49] standard against it every time you see
[1:53:51] you get it now now Jesus being revealed
[1:53:54] to his disciples now look in the Garden
[1:53:56] of Eden when Cain brought an offering in
[1:53:59] worship we know the story of Cain and
[1:54:02] Abel the two
[1:54:05] sons not both of them of Eve but two
[1:54:08] sons look in the Garden of Eden of Adam
[1:54:11] I mean because they were both from Eve
[1:54:14] look in the Garden of Eden when Cain
[1:54:16] brought up brought an offering In
[1:54:17] Worship the same as Abel did he
[1:54:21] worshiped Cain
[1:54:24] worshiped
[1:54:26] sorry Cain
[1:54:29] worshiped he brought an offering in
[1:54:32] worship and the same as Abel did he
[1:54:36] worshiped he paid to the church he
[1:54:40] sacrificed he done every religious deed
[1:54:44] my I remember hearing this the first
[1:54:46] time and excuse me thinking that this is
[1:54:49] so different from the example that I
[1:54:51] thought about Cain being such a wicked
[1:54:53] person and being so evil that he would
[1:54:55] kill his brother having Blood Stained
[1:54:58] hands and and garments and Cane just
[1:55:00] being such a wicked individual that he
[1:55:02] would kill his brother no no no no no
[1:55:04] the prophet Paints the picture here God
[1:55:06] through the prophet Paints the picture
[1:55:08] here this guy was a religious
[1:55:09] guy he was really involved with the
[1:55:12] church he wasn't just some crazed Maniac
[1:55:15] out there in the world look at the
[1:55:16] Garden of Eden when Cain brought an
[1:55:18] offering and worship the same as Abel
[1:55:20] did he woried he paid to the church he
[1:55:22] sacrif sacrificed he done every
[1:55:23] religious deed brighter better more
[1:55:26] fitted than what Abel
[1:55:28] did he built a better
[1:55:31] altar he made it
[1:55:34] prettier he put glamour to his
[1:55:38] worship you see that strain still
[1:55:41] working among the sons of
[1:55:47] Adam he put glamour to it with the
[1:55:50] fruits of the field and the big
[1:55:54] Lily and he not only that but he
[1:55:58] worshiped can you
[1:56:00] imagine there is a way that seeth right
[1:56:03] unto a man but what he did he worshiped
[1:56:06] through
[1:56:08] knowledge brothers and sisters don't let
[1:56:11] us worship through knowledge we have to
[1:56:13] worship one way through spirit amen and
[1:56:18] Truth amen but that's only one way
[1:56:22] he worshiped through
[1:56:24] knowledge he worshiped not by
[1:56:28] Revelation and it's possible get it
[1:56:32] now so this is where we have to say this
[1:56:35] is either a man speaking or this is God
[1:56:37] speaking through a man and we can choose
[1:56:40] it's possible he says get it now listen
[1:56:43] you can worship through
[1:56:45] knowledge you can go to church by
[1:56:48] knowledge that you should do it but
[1:56:51] going to church church that way is
[1:56:54] worshiping in
[1:56:56] vain why did we come here this morning
[1:56:58] brothers and
[1:56:59] sisters did we come here to see our
[1:57:02] brothers and sisters did we come here
[1:57:04] just because it's what we
[1:57:07] do or did we come here because we wanted
[1:57:10] to worship almighty
[1:57:13] God and this is where we go back maybe a
[1:57:16] couple of weeks to the last time we
[1:57:18] talked about this the high priest in the
[1:57:21] days of Temple worship when he would go
[1:57:24] in behind the inner Veil once a year if
[1:57:26] he didn't do it correctly to bring glory
[1:57:29] to God he died it meant death now for us
[1:57:33] today to not go behind that inner Veil
[1:57:36] means death it's the same thing for us
[1:57:40] we have been called all of the the
[1:57:43] Flaming cherubims that were put at the
[1:57:46] Garden of Eden I just can't help but
[1:57:47] think about this brothers and sisters
[1:57:49] and if you'll just imagine with me for a
[1:57:51] second we know that when Adam and Eve
[1:57:53] were sent out of the garden for
[1:57:55] disobeying God for the ACT that they did
[1:57:58] for the children they brought forth when
[1:58:01] they were sent out of the Garden of Eden
[1:58:02] God he made the first animal
[1:58:05] sacrifice right there and what did he do
[1:58:09] he cut the skins of the animals he said
[1:58:11] that fig leaves religion is not enough
[1:58:14] the only thing that's going to cover
[1:58:15] your sin until I come myself and make a
[1:58:18] way is going to be the blood of bulls
[1:58:20] and goats so he cut skins off of animals
[1:58:23] and clothed them with those and sent
[1:58:25] them out of the garden and brother
[1:58:26] bradam talked about how when they walked
[1:58:28] out of the garden in shame those skin
[1:58:30] slapped against their thighs and their
[1:58:32] calves and the blood of the animal was
[1:58:34] slapping against Their Skin showing that
[1:58:37] there was something covering them not
[1:58:41] religion and you know when that happened
[1:58:44] what's the next part there was flaming
[1:58:47] cherubims sword that went always way
[1:58:51] around the tree of life that's the story
[1:58:54] right in Genesis there was a flaming
[1:58:56] sword that went around every single way
[1:58:58] top and bottom front back everywhere
[1:59:00] around that tree of life was guarded you
[1:59:02] were no longer allowed to do it you
[1:59:04] could not go and get close to that tree
[1:59:07] of life partake of it but you know in
[1:59:10] the day that we're living in we've gone
[1:59:11] through the restor the Reformation we've
[1:59:14] gone through the restoration the tying
[1:59:16] up of all the Loose Ends and we know
[1:59:18] that the prophet in our day he had a
[1:59:20] sword placed in his hand I can't help
[1:59:22] but think what sword was that brothers
[1:59:24] and sisters we know the word of God said
[1:59:26] that it was the king's sword I just had
[1:59:28] this thought while we're preaching here
[1:59:30] maybe just maybe it was one of those
[1:59:32] swords that was guarding the tree of
[1:59:34] life now he had the ability to cut his
[1:59:36] way back to the Tree of Life to have
[1:59:39] full access to the tree of life there's
[1:59:41] no reason no excuse to not go all the
[1:59:44] way in behind the inner
[1:59:47] Veil and we find the prophet going
[1:59:50] through all of that we know that he said
[1:59:52] that all Adam lost had been restored
[1:59:54] what did Adam lose access to the tree of
[1:59:58] life not just living a beautiful life in
[2:00:01] the Garden of Eden where he could say
[2:00:02] thou tree over here I don't like you
[2:00:04] there be planted over here oh my the
[2:00:06] wind is a little bit a little bit hot we
[2:00:08] need to cool the temperature just a
[2:00:10] little bit or maybe we need a little
[2:00:11] more mist or maybe we need a little more
[2:00:13] fruit it's not that it's the restoration
[2:00:16] of the word the restoration of the
[2:00:19] access back to Christ that tree in the
[2:00:23] garden brother Bram he says this here
[2:00:25] and it's possible get it now listen you
[2:00:27] can worship through knowledge you can go
[2:00:30] to church by knowledge that you should
[2:00:32] do it but going to church that way is
[2:00:35] worshiping in vain but when there's
[2:00:38] something happens down in your heart
[2:00:40] that makes you love
[2:00:42] God and that would be my desire brothers
[2:00:44] and sisters maybe you might be saying I
[2:00:46] just can't wait for the next 11 minutes
[2:00:48] to happen so that brother Barry would
[2:00:50] just shut up and stop harping on this
[2:00:53] word you know what it's only going to be
[2:00:55] that that many more minutes and then
[2:00:56] I'll stop but you know brothers and
[2:00:58] sisters my desire for us today is that
[2:01:01] we wouldn't just be going to church just
[2:01:02] because it's a a a a Duty or a religion
[2:01:05] that we do it's worshiping in vain if we
[2:01:07] do that but I I just pray that there
[2:01:09] would be something that would happen
[2:01:11] down in our heart that would make us
[2:01:12] love God that we would fall in love with
[2:01:15] God and recognize that he died for me it
[2:01:18] wasn't for someone else somewhere out
[2:01:20] there it was just for me
[2:01:23] he says in such a way that you can't
[2:01:26] stay from church that's the revelation
[2:01:30] God revealing we know that David said my
[2:01:33] heart was glad oh my when they said to
[2:01:37] us let's go down to the house of the
[2:01:39] Lord oh my isn't there something that
[2:01:41] happens in the heart of a Believer when
[2:01:42] we know that there's a service when we
[2:01:44] can go to church when we know that we're
[2:01:46] going to go and worship God not in vain
[2:01:48] because we've had a full restoration of
[2:01:50] the word
[2:01:52] it's no longer a partial
[2:01:55] truth he says they had no Bible then
[2:01:58] they didn't even have paper or slate to
[2:02:01] work with they had no schools of
[2:02:05] education and here we are we have 12200
[2:02:08] messages from a Vindicated Prophet at
[2:02:11] our fingertips on our phone churches
[2:02:13] that we can go and worship in but you
[2:02:16] know you find some people they would
[2:02:17] just say no I don't I don't have to go
[2:02:19] to church the prophet of God said yes
[2:02:22] yeah go to church even if you can't get
[2:02:24] a full serving of food if you can't get
[2:02:26] a full meal go to church amen somewhere
[2:02:30] along the way that was changed though
[2:02:32] and I'll just say it this way it's by
[2:02:34] the erosion of the devil he gets in and
[2:02:36] just erodes it he takes truth and twist
[2:02:38] it but we have the ability brothers and
[2:02:40] sisters When We Gather here in this
[2:02:42] building to worship almighty God we have
[2:02:45] the ability to go in behind the inner
[2:02:47] Veil that's what we're doing here that's
[2:02:49] what this is all about when we get here
[2:02:51] it's not about about coming and and
[2:02:53] trying to be a part of something and and
[2:02:55] seeing whether we can test the waters on
[2:02:57] whether there's an anointing or not the
[2:02:59] anointing is right here we bring the
[2:03:01] anointing with us it's not sitting in
[2:03:04] this building waiting for us there's
[2:03:05] many churches that treat that that teach
[2:03:07] that way that's not the way it is in our
[2:03:09] day we bring Christ with us but when we
[2:03:12] all bring our licks of fire that Pillar
[2:03:14] of Fire our sacred portions together
[2:03:17] what happens we have one Pillar of Fire
[2:03:20] in our midst which is the Lord Jesus
[2:03:22] Christ and you know if we can come to
[2:03:25] that place where we recognize what we're
[2:03:26] doing here this ain't about church this
[2:03:29] ain't about church politics this is not
[2:03:32] about us just pretending and coming to
[2:03:34] church it's not just about in a religion
[2:03:36] where we just cover ourselves with fig
[2:03:38] leaves and say I believe the message of
[2:03:39] the hour if that's all it is then we
[2:03:42] just have a religion that's just a fig
[2:03:43] Leaf we've got to go beyond that we got
[2:03:46] to go beyond the animal skins we've got
[2:03:48] to go beyond realizing that Christ even
[2:03:50] died for us in Calvary we got to go to
[2:03:52] the place where we recognize that he's
[2:03:54] living out through us now where it's
[2:03:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:03:58] and forever that's the reason the
[2:04:00] prophet spoke the way he did paragraph
[2:04:03] 111 he said they had no Bible then they
[2:04:05] didn't even have paper or slate to work
[2:04:07] with they had no schools of education so
[2:04:10] Abel by Revelation it was revealed to
[2:04:12] him by God that it was not Beauty
[2:04:16] neither was it the fruits of the field
[2:04:18] or apples that had drove them from the
[2:04:21] garden of Eden but it was blood it was
[2:04:24] blood that did it and it was revealed to
[2:04:27] him and he went and got a lamb by
[2:04:30] Revelation he foresaw the coming of the
[2:04:33] just lamb and it was revealed to
[2:04:36] him so we got a
[2:04:39] lamb and by a revelation offered it to
[2:04:43] God and it was accepted the whole church
[2:04:46] is built upon spiritual Revelation how
[2:04:49] beautiful and I I'll just throw this in
[2:04:51] there today it's built on spiritual
[2:04:52] Revelation no longer about the re the
[2:04:56] reformers even though we study and and
[2:04:58] try and learn it's no longer about the
[2:05:01] restoration it's all about who we are as
[2:05:04] Sons and Daughters of the most high God
[2:05:06] are we Justified are we Sanctified and
[2:05:09] are we stuck in either one of those
[2:05:10] positions because if we are there's more
[2:05:13] we can go on to the true filling of the
[2:05:16] Holy Ghost in our lives and you know
[2:05:18] anything else is false any other
[2:05:21] Doctrine is false any other Doctrine is
[2:05:23] going to put us into the mark of the
[2:05:26] beast any other Doctrine is going to put
[2:05:28] us in a place where we're going to say
[2:05:30] didn't wasn't wasn't Elias supposed to
[2:05:32] first
[2:05:33] come even Snoopy actually knew that
[2:05:37] remember that little cartoon if anybody
[2:05:40] doesn't know I I can actually send it to
[2:05:42] you but Charles Schultz the creator of
[2:05:45] Snoopy the cartoon he actually put that
[2:05:46] in there in one of the cartoons wasn't
[2:05:48] Elias supposed to first come there's
[2:05:49] going to be people that say well I
[2:05:51] thought that this was was supposed to
[2:05:52] happen and I thought that was supposed
[2:05:53] to happen before the Rapture of the
[2:05:55] Church of the Living God and you know
[2:05:56] what the church is already going to be
[2:05:58] gone the the Rapture will already have
[2:06:01] happened this is about knowing who we
[2:06:03] are brothers and sisters and to come to
[2:06:05] the place of recognition that Jesus
[2:06:07] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:06:09] forever and that he is alive and and the
[2:06:11] same in our lives and recognizing that
[2:06:14] when we come to this building here in
[2:06:16] here this building is not just a church
[2:06:19] building this is the sanctuary when we
[2:06:22] gather together in his name what does
[2:06:24] the word of God say where two or three
[2:06:26] are gathered in his name that he's there
[2:06:29] in their midst so how ought we to behave
[2:06:33] while he is there in their midst am
[2:06:36] should we be clipping our
[2:06:38] fingernails thinking I sure wish brother
[2:06:40] Barry would just be done man I I just
[2:06:43] got so many different things I want to
[2:06:44] do
[2:06:46] today is it is it is it just maybe an
[2:06:49] inconvenience for us to come to church
[2:06:51] and yeah I could go on and on and I I
[2:06:53] don't mean to make us feel uncomfortable
[2:06:55] brothers and sisters I just want to try
[2:06:56] and encourage us to recognize what is it
[2:06:59] we're doing when we come here we're
[2:07:01] coming to meet with God
[2:07:03] Almighty the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[2:07:07] you know as our brother prayed earlier
[2:07:09] today one of these days this will be the
[2:07:11] very last meeting and will we think that
[2:07:13] maybe I had a little bit more amen or a
[2:07:15] little bit more worship to give God and
[2:07:17] I held it back because I was tired or I
[2:07:20] held it back because of of of of of of
[2:07:22] brothers and sisters don't don't hold
[2:07:25] back when you come here give him all you
[2:07:27] got if you want to see God move in your
[2:07:30] life give him all you got and see if he
[2:07:34] won't bless you I'll call the musicians
[2:07:36] as we pull one more quote here in 1964
[2:07:40] the Harvest Time and I can't help but
[2:07:42] think that's exactly where we are
[2:07:43] brothers and sisters the Harvest time we
[2:07:46] know the prophet of God said in the
[2:07:48] message the invisible Union of the Bride
[2:07:50] right at the very end he said I hear the
[2:07:52] combine coming the combine's coming and
[2:07:55] we know that when the combine comes
[2:07:56] there's grains that it cuts and it sorts
[2:08:00] and it sifts the grain from all the
[2:08:01] shaft spits out the shaft and takes the
[2:08:04] Grain and puts it into the Garner the
[2:08:05] prophet in his day he said I hear the
[2:08:08] coming of the combine the Harvest Time
[2:08:11] here in 1964 he says but he is going to
[2:08:14] judge the world and he has got to have
[2:08:17] some standard to judge the World by or
[2:08:22] he would be unjust to let us go now and
[2:08:26] live this life without a standard to be
[2:08:28] judged
[2:08:31] by such a beautiful
[2:08:33] thought who would be right where could
[2:08:37] you tell us was right there has to be a
[2:08:40] standard and there has to be a standard
[2:08:43] brothers and sisters there's many
[2:08:45] different examples I could come up with
[2:08:46] and for time's sake I'm not going to
[2:08:48] bore you with it today maybe stand with
[2:08:50] me as we close as we read the rest of
[2:08:52] this there has to be a standard and he
[2:08:56] said in his Bible that he would judge
[2:08:58] the World by Jesus
[2:09:01] Christ and we read here that Jesus is
[2:09:04] the word in Hebrews 138 he said he is
[2:09:06] the same yesterday today and
[2:09:09] forever I want to say this so don't go
[2:09:12] taking Jesus and putting him out there
[2:09:15] as God don't take God and put him out
[2:09:17] there as some Dody old grandpa that's
[2:09:19] somewhere floating around on a cloud
[2:09:22] and maybe some sometimes once in a while
[2:09:24] he might hear your prayer if you pray
[2:09:26] just right or if you act just right or
[2:09:28] if you do just right no that's not who
[2:09:32] we're talking about he's the same
[2:09:33] yesterday today and forever so therefore
[2:09:35] he will judge the church by their
[2:09:38] attitude towards Christ who is the
[2:09:43] word I think that's just powerful he
[2:09:47] will judge the church by their attitude
[2:09:50] towards Christ who is the
[2:09:52] word man shall not live by bread alone
[2:09:55] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[2:09:57] the mouth of
[2:09:59] God not out of the mouth of
[2:10:01] man not out of the mouth of a
[2:10:05] seminary not out of the
[2:10:07] church but out of the mouth of
[2:10:10] God man must live by that and that
[2:10:15] alone not man's
[2:10:17] interpretation but God's Own word amen I
[2:10:21] want to say brothers and sisters what is
[2:10:24] that
[2:10:25] standard that he's raising up some might
[2:10:27] say well he raised up a prophet in our
[2:10:29] day and maybe he's raised up Bishops and
[2:10:33] archbishops and Elders there's a few
[2:10:35] generals I would say in this message of
[2:10:37] the hour that are in their 80s that have
[2:10:40] pressed this battle for 50 plus years
[2:10:43] Believers of this word all the Winds of
[2:10:45] Doctrine have come and gone and they
[2:10:46] have not rattled they have not shaken
[2:10:48] they are humans but they still stand
[2:10:51] upon on the word of God but who is the
[2:10:53] standard there has to be a standard
[2:10:55] today some might say it's the church my
[2:10:59] church I'd like to say it was our church
[2:11:02] but I I know for sure what I'm trying to
[2:11:04] get across is it's not that it's
[2:11:07] you you are the standard that he has
[2:11:09] raised up in this age we are the
[2:11:13] standard that he has raised up in this
[2:11:14] age you know out of 1
[2:11:16] Thessalonians 5:22 it says abstain from
[2:11:21] all appearance of
[2:11:24] evil that doesn't leave a whole lot of
[2:11:27] room for interpretation of how close we
[2:11:29] can flirt with this
[2:11:31] world verse 23 says and the Very God of
[2:11:34] Peace sanctify you
[2:11:37] holy
[2:11:38] remember the spirit of the Lord shall
[2:11:41] lift up a standard against the
[2:11:44] enemy that it's the spirit of God who
[2:11:48] will sanctify you holy the very God of
[2:11:52] Peace will sanctify you holy and I pray
[2:11:54] God your whole spirit and soul and
[2:11:57] body be preserved blameless unto the

[2:12:08] bless you today let's just bow Heavenly
[2:12:11] Father Lord we thank you for the
[2:12:13] standard that you have given us Lord
[2:12:16] knowing that there is a full restoration
[2:12:18] of your word Lord there's so many things
[2:12:21] that we could talk about but we know
[2:12:23] that there's one thing father that will
[2:12:25] unlock the entirety of the message to us
[2:12:28] in the day in which we live and that is
[2:12:29] to truly receive you on the basis that
[2:12:33] you have given yourself and that is
[2:12:35] through the true baptism of your Holy
[2:12:37] Spirit Lord father today I just feel
[2:12:40] just as impressed as I have in the past
[2:12:42] Lord father to ask Lord to intercede for
[2:12:46] anyone Lord who doesn't know you in the
[2:12:49] power of your Resurrection father
[2:12:52] to the degree that we can know you
[2:12:54] father that you are the same yesterday
[2:12:56] today and forever father if anybody here

[2:13:01] spirit in their lives I pray that you

[2:13:05] name of Jesus Christ Lord that they
[2:13:08] could know you in a way like they never
[2:13:11] have father through the transforming
[2:13:13] power of your life Lord Jesus that they
[2:13:16] would allow your mind to be in them Lord
[2:13:19] Jesus that they would lay aside all of
[2:13:21] their humanity and say be it unto me
[2:13:24] according to Thy word just like Mary did
[2:13:27] and father we know that you will come on
[2:13:29] the scene that you father will
[2:13:31] overshadow them with the power of the
[2:13:34] highest Lord and that your spirit will
[2:13:36] begin to live father there will be a
[2:13:38] little kick in the womb Lord and we'll
[2:13:40] feel that life jump inside of us Lord
[2:13:43] Jesus and we'll know that we'll never be
[2:13:44] the same again every time we hear
[2:13:47] something in your word there will just
[2:13:48] be an amen to it father Lord if there's
[2:13:51] anybody here that needs more of you
[2:13:53] father I pray that you would Grant it to
[2:13:55] them Lord father if our experience has
[2:13:58] grown cold Lord Jesus forgive us for it
[2:14:00] Lord help us push aside all of the
[2:14:03] things the thoughts and the ideas that
[2:14:05] have allowed us Lord to grow cold in our
[2:14:07] lives and father renew in US Lord Jesus
[2:14:11] your spirit father I pray that you would
[2:14:14] just grant unto us Lord that that
