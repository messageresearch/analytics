========================================

bless you all it's just a little special or I'm not a singer so I was asking the Lord something I could do to encourage the body here so I've got about six poems written and about six more in the works so I'm just gonna trust the Lord and I'll read one tonight and we'll go from there I trust it's a blessing this poem is titled the redeemed bride of Christ in the end of days faithful Hearts did pray their voices raised High with much to say our father conveying their love with reverence they raised his name above hard sayings they loved and adored for it came by thus saith the Lord my heart's overwhelmed as they knew for sure in God's hands their souls were secure with glory on high his Saints didn't magnify their love for God a constant Supply light and darkness both in them dwelt God's nature the Holy Spirit did smelt [Music] with tears of joy they proclaimed with awe thy kingdom has come to Prevail overall their ranks and numbers he did thin when he came to his position within they arose to the challenge standard set for the balance in his will they always stayed through trials and storms their faith never swayed with trust and obedience they abide it through his Redemption they confidently confide it Overjoyed they testified with zeal prophecy spoken then fulfilled to reveal their very being to God they gave by grace and mercy others they did safe the great tempter vanquished evil overcome by God's design their faith Was Won for in him their power and their Glory they attested a connection above their hearts fully invested with heavy hearts their prayer they did end with amen and the hearts of their loved ones to God they did Bend Lord bless you all
