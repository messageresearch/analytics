TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um I had the song in my heart yesterday I was just uh listening to some songs that were written by Brother Leon yearns um and uh this particular one just came to my heart and I asked my brother to sing along with me the title is just say the right word and part of you know this song says that just approach him with the right attitude and I said to myself Lord help me because I remember brother Brown said as well that the right attitude to any Divine promise will bring it to pass but many times I Stumble at The Vessel I stumbled at the Badger's King and I say Lord help me not to stumble at that because the promise is behind the budget skin and my attitude to the body's King is my attitude to the Divine promise I pray you'll be blessed this morning [Music] foreign [Music] food she said be done to me according Thy Word she said the right thing and the promise was given to us [Music] [Applause] [Music] approaching with the writers [Music] but he writes it that's the truth she said the right word as Sons receive eternal life [Music] around 900 denominations [Applause] eyes they all say that he's coming back for them but The Showdown he's gonna tell who belongs to him [Music] she'll say the right word Rapture will take her away from me while you asked just [Music] die [Music] just say the right word what you asked me it's just [Music] she said the right word as Sons receive eternal life she said the right word as Sons receive eternal life foreign
