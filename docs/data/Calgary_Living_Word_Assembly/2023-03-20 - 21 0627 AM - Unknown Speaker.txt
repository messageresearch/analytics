gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy to each one Lord that we can call you gracious heavenly father I was just thinking about that thought this morning that that we could speak those words Lord what a tremendous thing that is just to itself to know you that way father we just want to hold the the saints that we've mentioned already before your throne that you

brother Jonah Lord God you have intervened for him as well he can be back at his post of Duty once again father we just love you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy you are so mindful Lord Jesus but father you know we're so thankful for the greatest miracle that there is on this side of Eternity and that is to be able to recognize our position in you father to be able to have eternal life to recognize what you have done for us Lord Jesus salvation for The Sinner is greatest miracle that we could ever experience in our lives Lord you making yourself personally known to us father Lord we never want to diminish that thought Lord we never want to forget Lord Jesus what you have done for each and every one of us Lord because we know when that recognition happens that seed cracks open and then your life comes to fruition we can never die Lord Jesus we just go to be with you or or we go by the way of the sky one of the two happens Lord father we're just so thankful for all that you do every single day of our lives and Lord right now we just ask that you would meet each and every prayer request Lord those who had needs who made them known to you father with with Faith by faith with an uplifted hand this morning Lord whether they're present in this building whether they're tuned in somewhere else Lord Jesus even if they're listening to a recording father we pray that

what to do with them Father that will bring them directly to you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to take a look at the book of Philippians if you could turn to Philippians chapter 2 I trust that everyone's weak has gone well so far and here we have the highlight of our week as Believers to get together with believers Fellowship around the word with the word Philippians chapter 2. start reading with verse 1. if there be there for any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of Mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the Same Love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross let's turn over to Second Corinthians chapter 3. some very familiar scriptures these are taken directly out of the Mighty God unveiled second Corinthians chapter three we'll start reading with verse 6. who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the administration of condemnation be glory much more doth administration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made righteous had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excellith for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious let's just bow gracious heavenly father was saying certainly thankful for your word Lord we know that we can turn back the pages of the Bible and read it carnally but father it takes your spirit to reveal it to us so father we pray that as we turn back the pages of the Bible today Lord as we read read the words written therein that father you would just reveal them to us Lord we pray that you would just bring out the the compound meanings and the compound Revelations to us today Father Lord that father I could get out of the way and just allow you father to minister to us Lord that the the spirit would be in continuity today Lord that there would be nothing Lord that would stand in the way of what you want to have said today and father if there's anything that would be contrary to your spirit now we just pray that father we could rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ Lord if there's anything that would try and exalt itself against your word today Father we pray that we could just cast it down in Jesus name and Lord just give you all the glory that you desire we pray that you would just speak to us now sovereignly father by Your Word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this morning just before we get into the word we have a couple of announcements um a few announcements in fact next week Sunday July the 4th it looks like we will return to regular services which I find astounding I I mean here we are I'm sure that everyone probably feels that way as well it's felt like almost an eternity going through this covid the last a year and a bit has been certainly challenging for everyone and uh you know we've we've made it through God has seen fit for us to go through this and he's brought us through it and now we go forwards together and we certainly trust that uh whatever he wanted to have accomplished through it has been accomplished that's why it's going to disappear why it's going to be over and we will go forwards nothing happens by accident there's no mistakes there's no accidental things that go on in our lives in this world around us it's all for a purpose amen we're certainly thankful to be a part of his purpose so next week July 4th next Sunday we'll return to regular services and I would say just look for a calendar it will be coming out in short order and uh I think it's going to be wonderful it's going to be absolutely wonderful to see the church fill up on on that wise brother Peter is planning to put the chairs back into the sanctuary and we just wondered if there was a couple of brothers or a few brothers that were interested in helping out a little bit that would certainly help brother Peter we just wanted to put that out there many hands make light work and uh I know carrying chairs can be a little bit monotonous but I don't think it would take very long to put the rest of the chairs back in here so if we could just consult brother Peter we'll get all the chairs back in here and we'll just see if we can't get all the people back in here we know that uh yeah it's amazing I actually feel nervous about having church again um it's been such a strange thing to go from Full Church to you know no church virtual Church to a few people in church and more people in church and now here we are and uh hopefully we can get rid of the groups and uh not see people click but have one body in one mind and one Accord everybody getting to fellowship with everyone once again that's what we want to see we're certainly excited about the the word today and uh we just trust that the Lord will bless it to our spiritual nourishment as I mentioned I've really been inspired by the message uh the Mighty God unveiled and the unveiling of God and it just hasn't really gone away you know we've talked about the the bread of life last week and uh I'm certainly not out of the Book of John and and I just have to go the way the Lord leads me and it sometimes feels I'm sure like I'm just bouncing around like a ping pong ball but I know it's all God's word and we just trust that his will is being accomplished the way this is happening so um the Mighty God unveiled it's tremendous message before that though before we get into that very far I just want to talk about the word unveiled and you know years ago we talked about it how brother Ken he did that that that that I don't even know what it was a statue I think it was just on a pedestal at the front of the church and he had it covered it was veiled and and it was such an amazing display of this topic and uh I I don't even know if we could find that message it certainly would be good to listen to but just to to know that the word unveiled is a powerful one in terms of the message of the hour if you look up the word unveiled uh it's great you get some really really good quotes um what sort of goes hand in hand with that is the word in morphe I'm sure that many people have looked that up as well it's mentioned 19 times in the message the word Amore brother Branham talks about it about it being a part of uh maybe a show or a play and and how there's many different people in it but sometimes one person will play a few different roles in in the same play and what they do is they change costumes they change masks and brothers and sisters in in my true fashion here we go with a punch line that's what God has done throughout all of the ages and that's what we're talking about today God unveiled before our eyes we know that he's done it uh throughout the ages in many different ways and I I just think with this topic we'll probably just sort of take our time and go through it and uh and not really jump too far ahead so Lord willing we'll see what happens today um but just talking about the word unveiled in order to be unveiled first there has to be a veil there has to be a covering there has to be something hidden in order for it to be veiled and it's interesting when we we talk about this scripture we could probably just carry on here in second Corinthians chapter three I'd like to read a little further I didn't want to keep everyone standing it's a bit of a long reading but uh we'll just continue on from verse 11. brother Branham talks he reads these two scriptures out of Philippians and out of second Corinthians in uh in the Mighty God unveiled in 1964. so chapter three of second Corinthians verse 11 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious brothers and sisters there's something that remaineth today verse 12 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away you know talking about this it's speaking about the Book of Revelation and when those two witnesses go back to Israel that's when this gospel that we're talking about will go back there and this gospel preached to the Jews will take away the Veil from the Jews it's interesting though because with that Veil there verse 15 says but even unto this day it's almost like when when we think about it I've thought about this quite a bit but when we think about it it's almost like the Jews just have a veil and the veil is over them and everything is there but what the word is saying here that when the book of Moses is read it causes the veil to happen it's not like they just have the blanket Veil over top of them like we talked about with the the display that brother Ken did although they do spiritually speaking their minds are blinded to the gospel that we believe which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart it causes a block those cherubims that were placed in the Garden of Eden to block the way back to the Tree of Life those cherubims now are opening the way of life to us back to the Tree of Life pushing back all the powers of Darkness making a path for us to go right back to where we're supposed to be but the children of Israel they actually still guard the way back to the Tree of Life they can't go past those angels those cherubims but there's coming a day brothers and sisters when we're taken out where that gospel this gospel will go right back to them and those cherubims will then step back and they will Usher in the children of Israel to the Tree of Life verse 12 seeing that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech just like Paul said we don't come to you with cunningly devised Fables and the Excellence of man's Wisdom we're not interested in that we're interested in the power and the demonstration of the spirit if we read verse 17 and 18. now the Lord is Spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty in the footnote in my Bible says freedom brothers and sisters we won't always have this freedom to my way of thinking I think that's my takeaway from covid people get sick and people get vaccinated and all that stuff but you know what really rang true with me I got voted in to be a pastor and I think it was six weeks after that it was turned off my takeaway is one of these days it will be just like that overnight Everything Will Change it will not not be the same so what I'm getting to brothers and sisters just from verse 17 is where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty if there's the spirit of Lord here today then brothers and sisters you should have Liberty we should have freedom to worship there is no judgment there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if we are here and we have the Lord Jesus Christ here then brothers and sisters there should be Liberty to worship we should have the ability to jump up and down to Scream and Shout Whatever it is whatever you feel like doing I don't think anybody's going to put a restriction on it in fact I would say if you have an inclination to say something to do something if it's going to be in the spirit then brothers or sisters just go for it there is there is no judgment I think we have such a tremendous opportunity here if we talk about some of the people around the world who are persecuted just for being a Christian just to say that they're a Christian whether they're Roman Catholic or or whether they're Anglican or whether they're Pentecostal or Baptist or whether they're message believing if you say the word Jesus Christ and in part of your language and you say that's what I stand for you are heavily persecuted and here we are here we are in the land of the free we can worship freely speak about the things that so many so many Ages were longed for so many different people desire to see it and we have it all in our hands Verse 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord where that Liberty is we are changed brothers and sisters we become new creatures in Christ Jesus we don't remain the same remember how they were on the day of Pentecost the 120 in the upper room they came out in the middle of the day and they were called drunk people they said oh they've been into the communion wine they must have had a real good community in there and just had a couple extra drinks maybe they did it the Roman Catholic way I had someone telling me this a little while ago for communion that uh they don't even drink the wine if it's wine that they drink the priest drinks the wine for each person that goes through the line you'd be stumbling out of there at the end of it but brothers and sisters when that stimulation of Revelation hits you you don't act like a normal person you can't how can we act like a normal person how can we just be the same it's impossible we have uh such a great cloud of witness all around us it's tremendous to be a part of it speaking about unveiled I'm just going to take time and and talk about some quotes about being unveiled and and we'll just see what the Lord will do here out of Jesus arose in 1956. so way before the seals were open Jesus arose and God raised him up and put him so high above every Heaven speaking about Jesus Christ here and God raised him up and put him so high above every Heaven until he has to stoop over to look to heaven that's what God did for him so if you want to be exalted humble yourself and if you exalt yourself you'll be brought down low and I think of him that when he had risen from the dead that morning that he was then had his own blood as the high priest and he went beyond the veils through every sphere Satan in the times past had men blocked off from heaven Satan in times past had men blocked off from heaven today Satan has men blocked off from Heaven how does that happen their minds become veiled their minds become blinded and you know what does it today is tradition Traditions will block our minds from what the message of the hour truly is Traditions will keep us from actually going all the way in to the inner Veil Satan in times past had men blocked off from heaven he could not get in contact with heaven but when Jesus took his blood the first Veil he rent was the veil of death I love how he goes through this and talks about the different veils this is out of Jesus arose in 1956. when Jesus took his blood the first Veil he rent was the veil of death and the veil of the grave and the veil in the temple he made it an open display that when he was dead on the cross in his flesh when he bowed his head and said it is finished when his body gave up the ghost he said to his father into thy hands do I commit my spirit when that happened we know that he went right into the temple and he rent the Veil from bottom to top from top to bottom tore it and you know everyone at the time who were involved with that they knew what was going on but they didn't want to admit it the priests they knew what was going on they didn't want to admit it and how did they know the proof of it is that they tried to bribe the guards at the end they told them don't say anything to anyone we'll give you a lot of money if you just shut your mouths and say that it was the disciples that took his body they knew what happened how did that Veil get torn from the top to the bottom in the temple could you imagine someone going into the temple in that day Jesus couldn't go into the temple and speak words speak the truth the word couldn't go into the temple and actually preach the word without there being a great problem How could somebody go into the temple and tear the Veil to the holy of holies it's amazing to think about but that was the first stop that he made after he conquered death and after he conquered the grave he just bypassed both of those it's amazing to think about hey went right into the temple and tore the veil in two and said now it's finished now there is a way back to the tree of life now I have provided that way and I'm going to tell the Angels the cherubims to step aside those flaming swords just take one step back for the Gentile bride now has access to the Tree of Life which they didn't have before his blood the first Veil he rent was the veil of death and the veil of the grave the veil in the temple and then he just sort of brings it a little further down I love this part the veil of the temple and then the veil of sickness think about that brothers and sisters by my stripes are ye healed he says it both ways in the Bible by my stripes were ye healed and by my stripes are ye healed present tense and past tense both of those sickness the veil of sickness he rented brothers and sisters it's torn the veil of fear he took the veil of fear and tore it for we have not been given the spirit again to bondage of fear but we've been given the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind brothers and sisters if we are starting to fear if we're starting to have anxiety come over our bodies if we're starting to fear something's happening to us that we can control and and things are feeling out of control and and we have this overwhelming fear brothers and sisters it's an attack of the devil it's an Affliction of Satan it's a Tormentor of a devil coming upon you and you have the ability to say Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and you know what sometimes brothers and sisters we don't even have the ability to say that and I'll say it because I've witnessed it I've experienced it I don't understand it at the time I didn't understand it sometimes we don't understand it but you know we can always pick up the phone and say brother or sister can you pray with me I don't know what's going on in my life I have this great fear I have this great anxiety in my life but you know what Satan doesn't want us to do that Satan will say no if you do that you're weak if you if you call someone and you say that you're afraid or you're scared or you've got something going on in your life they'll talk about you they'll say you're weak oh yeah they'll they'll they'll pray with you all right and then they'll phone their other brothers and sisters and say oh look at the pastor he needs prayer for something he's a weakling you know what that is brothers and sisters that's Satan that's the devil that's the devil if you want to call someone and talk to someone we should be able to call any one of our brothers and sisters and talk to them about just about anything within reason and not have any fear that someone's gonna go and talk I'm towards about another brother or sister in fact I think there's even a quote we should be so close that we should be able to just like chew each other's gum right isn't that what the prophet said I'm not going to recommend that we turn that into a Doctrine and I I just won't even say any more about it but you know what if it's what God wanted then hey pass out the gum right we won't die from it and you know pre-covet we would actually drink wine from the same cup now I'm getting into Muddy Waters now I'm painting myself right into a corner aren't I you know what I'm not I'm not going to suggest that we start doing that right away just for the record I think we'll keep things just the way they are keep things steady as they go we'll just use individual cups I I don't want to see any problems happen but you know brothers and sisters there is coming a time where we're going to have to look past all of the flesh all of the cares of this life every single thing that tends to bother us and and we worry about and are afraid of and just move past it because we we can read what a Vindicated Prophet said what happened when Jesus gave his blood for our lives all of these different veils were torn they weren't just taken and put aside they were torn they were destroyed veils brothers and sisters sickness has no power over top of Our Lives you know what Satan Satan could come around and and say to God you know I would even go so farther is to say this like job The Book of Job it wasn't even Satan that said it God said to Satan have you considered my servant job think about that God might come down and say have you considered my servant Barry have you considered him huh why don't you go and have a go at him and Satan will say oh yeah I'll get him to curse you to your face and you'll say no you won't you can't do it do whatever you want but don't touch his life destroy everything this is crazy because I'm making it personal it's not about job it's about me and brothers and sisters it's got to be about you it's got to be a personal experience we've got to understand that that's the way it works it's not uh some accidental thing that's going on there's a council in heaven about every single one of our thoughts let alone Our Lives it's beyond beyond or even comprehension but to think about it God will say have you considered my servant you can't get them to curse you to my face you can't do it and even to the place where he'll say go ahead take his life and you know what we'll have someone stand at their post of duty till they can't even stand anymore preaching the gospel because they know Satan can't touch them it's got to be that way for each and every one of us brothers and sisters to know that you can't touch me Satan and you know what if if God wants you to be able to do that then it's going to be for you his glory and I say Bring It On Hallelujah we don't want to Race Across The Finish Line we don't want to race to the bottom we're not talking about that don't don't put me in the grave Lord but whether I live or whether I die I'm Christ and Satan isn't going to change that testimony that will never happen because I know that that veil of death is rent I know that's happened I know that the veil of the Grave is rent I know that the veil of sickness is rent I know that the veil of fear is rent and every single Veil that there was his rent brother Bradham says this the veil of fear I'll just read this again his blood the first Veil he read was the veil of death the veil of the Grave the veil in the temple and then the veil of sickness the veil of fear and every Veil that there was everyone an unveiled God to man unveiled God to man now this is in 1956 remember this is pre-seals this is free brother Bradham the prophet for our day speaking and morphe he didn't speak that until 64. he didn't speak it until his third pull of his ministry sorry I get a little excited about it but he went way above he went way in above the heavens of heaven and was Seated on the right hand of God and set down as a finished work and you know brothers and sisters we said it already I'll say it again though but if we are in Christ Jesus then we are already seated down with him right now that's what the word says and and when that spirit of fear comes knocking on our door when that Spirit of sickness comes knocking on our door we need to push those thoughts back and we just need to say hey you know what can sickness come and sit down with Jesus Christ in heaven can fear come and sit down with Jesus Christ in heaven those veils have been torn and there's no room for for them to be there there's no seats for fear or sickness in heaven there isn't brother Adam says that's right all above and there he opened up a channel that God used to come down through the corridors of heaven and talk to Mankind in the Garden of Eden huh that story back in Genesis and Satan by sin had blocked them he did Satan came in and blocked that access he thought that he had it figured out he was created to be a worthy adversary but he could never beat God never Satan by sin had blocked them but the great high priest with his Anointed with his blood went through every Veil and ripped her open and cleared out the skies again that God and man could be father and son and commune again with one another what a marvelous thing he says what a marvelous thing Brother Brad I'm talking about this back in 56 just as a historical discussion now thinking about this he's talking about it from a theological standpoint he is a prophet and he has that rock of Revelation I'm not demeaning that or taking away from that in any way but I think that it changes a little bit when we get into the unveiling of God in 64. and the Mighty God unveiled after that it's it's it's wonderful thing and and like he said what a marvelous thing he's not taking away from what he taught later on he's actually speaking the same thing but he certainly Builds on what he's talking about here that God and man could be father and son and commune again with one another it just brings to mind the scripture behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God to think that he has people that he has chosen before the foundation of the world to be Sons and Daughters of God and you know I'll just say it I'll sprinkle it throughout over and over again I just I have to I feel like it it's just what I feel led to do I think if I had a Ministry I think this would be it brothers and sisters is just to recognize that you are the unveiling of God the people in every single Age We Know It the seven Church age book speaks of it its continuity goes from the beginning of the Bible right through to the end of the Bible every single story in the Bible is an example of God's own life on Earth every single one is an example of the supernatural god making himself known to man brothers and sisters it's the Mighty God unveiled in every single age and every single age had a certain amount of light allotted to it a certain amount of word allotted to it but you know today brothers and sisters even though it is the skinniest teeniest little sliver of light is what brother Branham said maybe not on those exact words the tiniest amount of light it's the most amount of Revelation out of all the ages the culmination of all of the ages worth of Revelation in our day today it's a marvelous thing is what brother Branham says talking about the uh the veil and and how their minds were blinded out of second Corinthians here let's just read it again second Corinthians we'll just read from verse six all the way through we've got lots of time second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6. who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life speaking about the law and Grace right there verse seven but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the administration of condemnation be glory much more death administration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by the reason of the glory that excellith for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord looking at this scripture knowing that Moses he put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished he's speaking about two things there one of them is when Moses came down off the mount when Moses came out of the Temple the other one is understanding that there will come a time where the law will end and Grace will go back to the children of Israel let's turn let's turn over to the Book of Exodus chapter 33 and just talk about this very specifically verse 13 as you turn over to Exodus chapter 33. just want to take a little bit of time and and talk about this because I feel there's just so much here we'll just start reading with verse 11 out of Exodus chapter 33. and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend can you imagine that just that right there I believe we could stop and have a service to think that the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend you know what where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty if we have the Holy Ghost in our lives and we speak to our brother we speak to our sister brothers and sisters we speak as the Oracles of God we need to remember that when we're talking to one another we're talking to a son of the most high God a daughter of the most high God don't allow Satan to put thoughts in our minds to come against that because every time that happens brothers and sisters if it seems to happen a lot I just want to throw this out there I don't even know why but I just feel led to go this way if it feels that way where you just have these thoughts about someone you know what it is it's because they are truly a son or daughter of God and you know what's happening is Satan is trying to get in the middle of you he's trying to mix it all up and get it all upset do the opposite is what the prophet taught do the opposite see what happens and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of none a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle he wasn't leaving that Shekinah Glory for nothing and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up these people and thou Hast not let me know with whom thou Wilt send with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for when shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name I just have to pause there and say this brothers and sisters you have found Grace in his sight if you have the ability to hear the word for our day you have found Grace in his sight this is not just a historical account of Moses this is about you you have found Grace in his sight because he knows you by name you didn't just get named by accident Verse 18 and he said I beseech thee show me thy Glory I just feel so encouraged by this brothers and sisters what if we just said that show me thy Glory show me thy glory Lord and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy upon whom I will show Mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock we have been given a place by him brothers and sisters whereby we can stand upon a rock we can stand upon the rock of Revelation understanding the word for our day understanding who he said we are verse 22 and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen to think about that my face shall not be seen just thinking about this we could talk about First Corinthians chapter 13. for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part it shall be done away with we're not going to be looking at the hinder parts all of the ages got to look at parts brothers and sisters we can go a little further here but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away remember when I was a child I spake as a child I understood it as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things I put away the the teachings that maybe the past ages live by and that was the light that they they lived by I just was having the conversation with the brother earlier uh I don't know about a week ago we're talking about someone beloved passing by that didn't really believe the message of the hour per se but was a Believer according to the light that they have it's amazing to think about it because even though they don't see it necessarily the way that we see it it doesn't mean they're not saved but the Branham says it very clearly don't think that Shelton Methodist grandmother of yours isn't going to be there because she lived according to the light of her day that's God's Sovereign choice and you know those people those those I would say soldiers of the Cross those people who are there from Generations prior they were warriors they were prayer warriors steadfast and true never deviating from the word no matter what comes along and they lived through some hard times just two or three generations back really hard times but still believers but when I became a man I put away childish things but verse 12 is what I wanted to get to for now we see through a glass Darkly but then what does it say face to face Moses got to see God and his hinder parts Moses just got to see the hind part of him the word says here that no man shall see God and live my own personal belief I'll just throw this out there it's coming a Time brothers and sisters where we will see God as he is where we will recognize what God is on Earth this side of Eternity and we'll go that's what the prophet said when we recognize what we are then the Rapture will go right there's coming a time where we'll come to that recognition where we'll see that we're no longer seeing the hinder Parts we're no longer just looking at bits and pieces we're no longer just gleaning our way along but we can see the fullness of the Lord because the Mighty God has been unveiled before our very eyes and where will he be unveiled brothers and sisters not in Revelations 19 in the sky he will be we'll meet him in the clouds but first something will happen first he'll break the bread and bless it first he'll use the last age Messengers the last stage preachers to just preach the word while the well the well the children of God they just ripen under the sun while those seeds just ripen and as they ripen the Harvest happens but now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to Faith face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I also I am known to look at that scripture and think that he's actually speaking about a future time where he will take away his hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen many people have desired to see the face of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know brothers and sisters we don't have to look very far in the message of the hour I know I'm not really preaching hard but I I'm I'll tell you I'm just running a marathon here I'm just set in a background I'm just trying to lay a foundation for what potentially could be coming but if you think about it let's just maybe fast forward and get into some of the deeper things here as we go and and and think that here Moses is told that I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen through the message of the hour through the prophet for our day the Vindicated Prophet the seventh major Angel messenger what did he say John was taken up he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and the whole world is saying the spirit on the Lord's day while he was in the spirit he got into the spirit the Pentecostal Spirit while he was at church on a Sunday or a Saturday or whatever day it is that that the people believe with their religion right but here we have the prophet for our day who takes us and says no no no that's not so what it is is a different time and place he's actually gone from time right into eternity and he's seen that there's a door open in heaven and when he sees the door open in heaven he's actually given an invitation to come hither and when he goes hither he's able to see one seated on the throne and that one seated on the throne has the book of redemption and he's given the whole story that if if there isn't a man worthy to come and take that book then all creation is lost everything is over your name is in there John and every other believer's name is in that book and if nobody is worthy to take that book then it's over forget about it for the first time ever man was shown the face of God through a Vindicated prophet and here he is talking about it but what happened on Sunset Mountain brothers and sisters what does the prophet for our day say about that picture of the cloud he says you can see his face you can see his eyes you can see his nose you can see his hair you can see the white wigged one one was Supreme deity with supreme authority now we see him face to face brothers and sisters it's no longer a mystery just like the rainbow you know from from the time that God created this Covenant and put it on Earth he set his bow in the cloud with Noah and said I'll never come and wipe out man with a flood again and I promise you forever and this this is a covenant that I set with man now for all the ages that I'll never do it every time I look on that bow I will remember my Covenant that's what God Said but he did it so that Noah could see it and remember that God's going to look at that bow every time we see a bow in the clouds brothers and sisters don't doubt it for a second that God sees it also every single time but you know just talking about prophesying in part and then when that which is perfect has come that which is perfect has come I'm saying that right now that which is perfect has come the message of the hour brothers and sisters is perfection it's the Lord Jesus Christ the second coming of the Lord don't be looking for a turnip when we're looking for the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham said it if you don't know what you're looking for you're going to miss it that's why I have to just keep hammering this I have to it's the age we live in I don't want to preach Noah's message I don't want to preach Moses message we need to preach the message of the hour and that is the coming of the Lord remember brother Bradham he said it I'm not looking for another Revival there's people today that are looking for revivals I remember when I was an unbeliever I'll just throw this out there I was I was I was smoking and I was drinking and I was I was just a complete unbeliever out in the world and and I went to this church the the Pentecostal church and and we met all men are people that went to that church and my dad had this one fellow who was a real religious guy I thought growing up him and his wife they were real religious and and they went down to Mexico and they worked in a an orphanage there and and they really did stuff for the Lord I grew up believing this with all my heart and and I was helping my dad work on his house way back before I was professionally into Renovations I was an amateur into Renovations and my dad had this house we were working on when we were working on this house um this guy was there this man was there at this house and I hadn't seen him for many many years I was a young boy probably like um our middle boy Benjamin I was probably about his age just about 10 years old 9 or 10 years old when I had seen him last now I'm an adult helping my dad renovate this house and I see this man there and I'm getting to a point about this and what I saw was this man he he was this religious guy and I had heard some stuff about him and I thought goodness sakes is that really what it is and I was already grossed out with religion as it were and you hear all of the the great online or or TV Ministries you know when you're in the world and you see all this nonsense and if you've ever had a taste of religion and you see these guys just pulling for money it's just another another lie is basically the way I felt and so here I am with this man and sort of reconnecting after all these years I'm probably like 29 years old at the time 28 years old and and doing my own thing and a man and and I have my own opinions formed and I meet this man again who's the religious guy and and he starts to talk to me and and begins to minister to me in his own way and begins to tell me that there's going to be a great Revival that's going to sweep the nation and it's going to start at the North End of Claire's Home Alberta and as an unbeliever I'm I'm I'm looking at this guy and I'm thinking what are you talking about I I couldn't buy it and I don't think it was even anything that he was about himself but I was just like I just don't believe that I just can't believe that there's something in me that just can't believe that and I know what it is now and I'm sure that anybody else who is a Believer today would be able to reckon with that you just can't actually buy into false you can't buy into lies but brother Branham said it and I'm so glad that that that that that same Spirit Vindicated what was actually speaking to me even there because you know what brothers and sisters I'll say this and I can say it by experience um God doesn't just start speaking to you one day sometimes maybe it's presented that way or sometimes maybe we think it that way or some sometimes maybe both God doesn't just start speaking to you one day God has spoken to you if he speaks to you today he has spoken to you your entire life the only thing that happens is you begin to recognize that voice you begin to go back in your life and start to connect the dots and say wow that was him speaking to me there and wow that was him speaking to me there and was that was him speaking to me there you go back in your life even as a ranked sinner even while we were yet dead in sin and trespasses right not not once we were all saved and Polished up in the church while we were yet dead in sins and trespasses today's the day brothers and sisters I just want to say it that you know our minds aren't blinded and we don't see the higher parts of God we see the fullness of God we live in the day brother Branham didn't just preach it just because it was a great topic just because it sounded cool and and forgive me if I'm saying it this way I'm just really trying to set a background I really don't mean to sound if it is condescending in any way I never want it to be that way but to think about it if we could just pause for a second and think about it the unveiling of God or or the Mighty God unveiled what does that mean that means that God is going to reveal himself to a group of people that means that he's revealing himself and you know I believe that once we recognize his revealing I said it before I'll say it again then the Rapture will go and where is he going to reveal himself brothers and sisters in Exodus 33 it's real interesting if if uh sorry Exodus 34. turn over to Exodus 34. we'll just read a little bit more here verses 29 and 30. sort of the outcome of what we were talking about Moses seeing the higher parts of God having God just cover his face and letting him see the hinder parts verse 29 of Exodus chapter 34. and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses hand when he came down from the mount that Moses was not that the skin of his face Shone while he talked to him verse 30. and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face Sean and they were afraid to come nigh him can you imagine what that would have been like have his face shine so much that they wanted to cover him with the Veil but isn't it interesting that that's what they did they covered him with a veil because he had just a little bit too much glory for his day maybe just a little bit too much Revelation for his day maybe he just was shown just a little bit too much for his day verse 31 and Moses called unto them and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with them and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai until Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face and when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he took the veil off because he got to speak to him face to face until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses faced Sean and Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him and I know that he didn't show him his face but what I'm saying with that is that he spoke to him as a friend he wasn't shown God's face he spoke to him as a friend face to face that's my implication there just for the record because I know what the word says but looking at this verse 13 of second Corinthians chapter 3 and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ all they would have to do is receive Christ if they receive Christ that Veil is taken away but how will they receive Christ by their own Prophets it has to be one of their own that takes the message back to them and when they do they will receive it they will receive Christ They will receive this very same message they'll realize the unveiling of God what an honor and a privilege it is I I sent a video out a while ago of the the children of Israel The Devout Jews they were worshiping in front of the Wailing Wall I'm not sure what the festival was I think it might have been the Festival of booths but the the the singing I don't know if anybody remembers seeing that video but the singing what it sounded like was one giant voice imagine the way the Jews will be when they recognize when they ask him where did you get those wounds and he'll say to them in the house of my friends imagine how those devout Jews those little Benjamins brother Branham calls them imagine how they will be brothers and sisters how much more ought we to be able to Worship in spirit and in truth to have the Liberty the freedom to understand the message of the hour to talk about it and just to be able to worship I'll tell you what I'm I'm seriously looking forward to some really good worship services with everyone getting back together again looking at this though to think that Moses he had to put a veil over his face and that same Veil is over the face of all of the Jews even to this day is what the word says when the word of Moses when Moses is read is what the word says hey even unto this day when Moses is read not even the word of Moses not the word of God when Moses is read the Veil is upon where their heart it's upon their hearts it's not even upon their minds it's not upon their eyes upon their heart but we know that their minds were blinded looking at the unveiling of God we talked about it a little while ago as we began to set a little bit of a background for this how many different times how many different ways did God choose to wear a mask choose to reveal himself to mankind we know I'm not even going to try and list them but every single one we talked about it the stories in the Bible is a representation of God in a specific story in a specific time it's it's what brother Bradham called the seventh seal being revealed in every single book of the Bible it's Jesus Christ in every chapter and every verse and every line and brother Branham said that if we don't see that then we need to go back and actually reread the Bible until we do because that's what it is the Bible is Jesus Christ the word but talking about the many different manifestations how God has shown chosen to represent himself to reveal himself to the world and express himself to mankind all of the different ways brother Bradham he called it in in the third pull of his ministry in the latter Parts like in 1964's when he started talking about it was en morphe that Greek word used 19 times in the message and the first time he used it was an unveiling of God excuse me I'm sorry I don't really know how to cough if I have to forgive me um the first time he used that word was in the unveiling of God and you know through this it's the introduction in plain language then he goes into the identified Christ of all ages he uses the word amorphy the identified Christ of all ages and I would say that's a great description it's probably a better description than what I used originally in that God had he had his identification in all ages the identified Christ through all ages all of the men and women that he chose to identify himself through the identified Christ of all the ages these are all messages that brother Branham preached in 1964. after the seals were open after John was shown that door open in heaven after the Mighty God came down and put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and held the open book and raised his hand to heaven and said there shall be time no more then he preached the Mighty God unveiled before us I just think that message is so astounding to think about the Mighty God unveiled before us then he preached a message called the masterpiece all of these are messages where he used the word amore where a man a a spirit a being uses a mask picks a body and steps into it amorphy God amore the Mighty God unveiled before us then the masterpiece then he preached who is this Melchizedek they're not in sequential order but he uses the word amorphe in every one of these messages the last one that he used it in is called ashamed to think about the power of amorphe to think that God chooses to Veil himself but to reveal himself unto babes who will learn you know the word says that we entertain angels unawares sometimes we meet people and we don't even know where they're from we don't even know how we connect to them but they could be angels you never know who we're going to bump into brothers and sisters it's tremendous to think about because at any time in any place we can bump into an angel of the Lord and he's not going to have wings and he's not going to be glowing he's not going to have Godly apparel but he could be God amorphe come down to see what's going on to see how we will react I'm not saying that God is doing that walking around but I I will say that he is using eyes and he is using ears and he is using mouths that's his way for today God amorphe and and this is really the the point of all of it brothers and sisters he's chosen different bodies to jump into throughout the ages why not yours why not mine I would say that I I feel like I need to consecrate this Temple if that's what's going on if that's his choice because I certainly don't feel like the The Dwelling Place of the most high God but I would say thanks be to God for a prophet that would say your feelings have nothing to do with it that the Holy Ghost which is actually his Spirit amore in the human the holy spirit is without sensation and that there's only one true evidence of whether you have the Holy Spirit or not there's definitely attributes towards it attributes that go along with it but the true evidence is one thing that's your ability to receive the word for your day to be able to recognize who you are in the scripture to recognize your place in the word you know he revealed himself throughout the ages through His prophets I'll read a quote out of unveiling of God in 64. that's the way God did he bred this one to that one this one to that one to this one to that one till he got exactly what he wanted many times we look at our lives and think that you know I'm I'm just a product of you know Al and Sharon Johnson and and their parents and and their parents and their parents and their parents and it's just the way life works and it's an accident no it's not an accident it's exactly the way God's designed it exactly according to his purpose because remember there's a council in heaven for every single thought that we have let alone every single action when God has a plan and has a purpose he will say to the angels the Heavenly hosts who's going to go and accomplish my word in in that person's life on Earth God doesn't go and do it but he has Messengers that does and while those Messengers go they cause it to happen that's the way God did it he bred this one to that one to this one to that one to this one to that one until he got exactly what he wanted that's how he come down God unveiled himself in a pillar of fire down through the prophets then into the Son of God which he was God see he's the same God bringing out exactly from Perfection to Perfection from glory to glory that's the way the church goes to think about that quote how can anybody say that Jesus wasn't God Jesus was the dwelling place of God Jesus was God a more faith Jesus was the body that God created to inhabit so that we could have a kinsman redeemer if it wasn't God's blood then we're all lost but he came down and he revealed himself through the prophets he come down God unveiled himself he pulled the covering off he showed his face it's not God pulling the covering off of his hinder parts that was for a different day but what brother Branham is talking about here is he's pulling the veil off of his face how can you recognize someone you could have four men exactly the same height exactly the same weight where exactly the same clothes same thing with sisters you could line up four here and four here and have all of them turned around and all of them could look the same right how would you tell them apart how would you recognize them the only way you could recognize them was to have them turn around and see their face when you see their face the veil is no longer covering them there's no more mystery there you can understand who they are you can put a name to the person and that's what happened in the message of the hour the prophet came and made it so simple God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same showing that Jesus Christ was God not another man not one of the three not another third person of a trinitarian Doctrine from hell because that's what he said it was that's what it is it's an antichrist Spirit that's crept into the church causing it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless but he unveiled himself and I just love how he says this too he unveiled himself in a pillar of Fire down through the prophets we can put that off in the past and say yeah that's you know he did but he also did today right revealed himself in a pillar of fire through the prophets today he come down God unveiled himself in a pillar of fire through the prophets then into the son of God which he was God see he's the same God bringing out exactly from Perfection to Perfection from Glory unto Glory that's the way the church goes I just can't help but think about that scripture in Ephesians or talks about that Glory that shall be revealed where in US That Glory is what we're talking about brothers and sisters Perfection to Perfection his Perfection coming out in our lives being expressed through us us being the expression of his perfection in this age how could that possibly be we would never say it we would never even see it really but we have to believe it it has to be something we believe because that's what the word says you know the song We Sing he looked at our perfect picture right it wasn't a a spotted picture his wife hath made herself ready with a spotless garment it's from Perfection to Perfection from glory to glory that's the way the church goes is what the prophet says from perfection from the original perfection in the Garden of Eden the spoken word existence right down through the fall of all mankind seemingly helpless hopeless no hope in sight a chain dangling over hell to the place where he comes down God and morphe in a different mask and reveals himself to us reveals himself not just to us brothers and sisters but this is what I want to point out through the message this is where I'm going with this and I would just encourage anyone who wants to study along with it not just God to us but God through us that's what the prophet brought in the message of the hour God unveiling himself through us remember he said that he didn't come to start a church he didn't come to start an organization he didn't want to start as a nomination he came to reveal that you are the PowerHouse of the Holy Spirit if we're the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit then where is God today brothers and sisters if the holy spirit is God and God and the Holy Spirit are Jesus Christ if the three are not three but they're one and you have a part of one of them then who are you it can't be any different it can't be part me and part him can it because the word says a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways it's got to be Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory that's why I say it over and over but brother Branham said that every single Speck of the old man has to die has to be a dying out there has to be a a a watery grave there has to be a time where we say I've just had enough of me and I want more of him and and to think that we have the opportunity to just fall on our face and worship just like Moses did we have the opportunity to just Proclaim his glory we have the opportunity to do that so why wouldn't we we don't want to let this world hold us back from enjoying all of the Liberty that we have you know the whole world even in the midst of covid they're going to put on the Stampede they're going to go and have a total carousing yahoo time in sin and they're going to do it the whole world does it over and over again what holds us back from just proclaiming the glory of the Lord from shouting to the Lord and thanking him for what he's done for us he's come down and revealed himself to us through the prophets through a pillar of fire now we're just about out of time again he's revealed himself to us through the word he's revealed through the Life of Christ he's revealed through the message now brothers and sisters how he reveals is through his word on our lips through his word on our lips that's how he reveals himself out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh is what the word says what do we talk about where do we dwell I just want to say this if you're a Believer this morning if you've been baptized according to the scripture then brothers and sisters you are the revelation of Jesus Christ today if you are a Believer according to the message of the hour you are the revelation of Jesus Christ to this world some people would say well Brandon was that guy brother Bradham was the wave Chief brother Branham was the example for every one of us to come to that's astounding when you think about it because you couldn't tell his friends from his enemies and his enemies from his friends some of us we still have the old men old men very much alive in our lives and we still have people that we just can't stand to see can't stand to be around you know we have to just kill that that has to fall away that has to die in our lives that's not the life of Christ brother Branham said that we wouldn't wish Eternal separation from the Lord to anyone even our worst enemies but brothers and sisters you today are the revelation of Jesus Christ it's so humbling when you think about that I just can't even almost can't even bear the weight of that thought to think that I would be the revelation of Jesus Christ who me how could that possibly be there's no way but that I recognize that voice that's not the spirit of Truth that's not only believe that's Satan saying look at your flesh how could you possibly ever measure up to that how could you ever attain to that level you never could I never could on our own we never could but we know that atonement that was made that book that was given to John that John was told to eat up that book contained everything that we needed to make us exactly the way he wanted us to be the way he created us to be you are the revelation of Jesus Christ today a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ on Earth and that is why when you go from here to Africa or to Asia or Antarctica or the Arctic or Russia or wherever it is in the world that we go to and we meet up with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith those people who have received the message of the hour we become one it's like we've known each other forever because we have brothers and sisters that Spirit that's in me is the Same Spirit that's in you it's not a different spirit it's a tremendous thing but it's alarming when you see people who claim to have the same Spirit but yet demonstrate a different life it's really bizarre and you know we can't help that the only thing we can do is try and encourage a more excellent way just like Paul did to say look you know what maybe you just haven't been taught right or maybe something isn't right but let me just show you a little bit of a different angle maybe a more expedient way not common say I've got I've got the fivefold ministry here now I'm going to show you I'm going to teach you because I know all the quotes and I know how to comprehend and I know how to actually straighten out that thing you know what that spirit is brothers and sisters that's a spirit of deception you know we were talking about this recently and it's a very much alive and well and I'm going to say it because I believe it should be said those people that think that they have well within them what it takes to go and combat those people who want to say that the cloud is actually false or come against the message of the hour you will never be able to contend with that Spirit brothers and sisters never that spirit will capture you if you pursue it look the other way don't go to it look the other way get away from it you'll never be able to rationalize with an irrational Spirit if it's not the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ then walk away rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ every single person that I've seen that has actually gone towards it because they're going to refute it they're going to point out all the quotes and the faults and straighten it out on its Doctrine what's happened to them is that Spirit has actually pulled them out it's grabbed a hold of them and taken them right away from church right away from fellowship right out into the world you won't be able to contend with it brothers and sisters there's only one true Spirit that's the spirit of Christ we want to make sure that we we remain in our place and there's no room for contentions or fightings or arguings those people are always going to be there and they're always going to do that and and they're not people they're Spirits we have been given the ability to discern the spirits we've been instructed to discern the spirits the spirit of discernment isn't just for a prophet it's for a prophetic people a special class of people and it doesn't mean that we're Elite I'll call the musicians it doesn't mean that we're we're better than anyone else what it means is that we're worse than everyone else and we recognize that and we've been given his spirit that makes us exactly who we were created to be to be a part of the many membered body the mystical body of Jesus Christ you know brothers and sisters brother bradham's Ministry was the unveiling of God to this generation to the final generation the message of the hour was was the unveiling of God and I would say is the unveiling of God because there's still people coming to the recognition of the message there's still people coming in there's still Grace in this world for those people that just haven't been able to see it yet all the way but today brothers and sisters don't think that brother Branham was the Mighty God unveiled he was he was the conduit that God chose to speak to the people through according to his word surely he'll do nothing unless he Reveals His secret through the prophets right he does everything according to the word his word he will never deviate from it but today brothers and sisters you if you've received the message of the hour you are the Mighty God unveiled and when we get that Revelation when we get that Revelation brothers and sisters that we are the Mighty God unveiled and we no longer look at ourselves through all the faults and failures and we no longer look at our brothers and sisters through all the faults and failures when we only look at ourselves and we say hey you know what I'm God's choice this is your choice right here this is who you chose and I just accept that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I just believe it just because your word says it just like I believe that you love me just because your word says it just like I believe that I have eternal life just because your word says it I also believe that you chose me to be your representation today maybe stand with me as we close we can look at the life of a prophet and say you know wasn't that nice wasn't that good and and it was and it can make it so easy to say and and easy to even Elevate to a place that he would never want it to be he would never have wanted to be elevated [Music] but he was arguable our example to eat the book just eat the book don't dispute with it don't try and study your way into it don't don't try and and be anything other than what the word says and just eat it just follow the instructions and eat it and by doing that we become what we eat brothers and sisters and we truly do become what we eat if we eat junk food then we become junk food if we eat whole food Pure Food then we become whole and we become pure and the only way that we can do that is to eat the book eat the message read the Bible read the message absorb it take it in the more we take it in the more we become like him the more we the more we have the ability to reflect him out how can we ever give out if we don't take him we need to be like a tree and just take and drink in when the water is coming when the blessings are falling take in raise up your hands and worship him and take them in because they're not always going to be there that way and and there could come a day where it's just over and we can no longer gather together we need to make sure that we just take advantage of the moment when we have it and eat the book today brothers and sisters we are the unveiling of God and I'll probably keep talking like this for a while so I apologize in advance but I just believe it once the church catches the revelation of what she is what it is then the Rapture will go and I don't want to be here another moment myself and you know what all that are Gods won't be lost I I I can't make it happen and maybe I'm a little bit anxious trying to talk that way and I don't want to be that way I want it to be exactly when God wants it to be the only thing I can do is just be about his business and just preach truth according to our day and that's all I want to do I just want to try and encourage each and every one that Lord we are the Lord's choice we are the one that he has chosen to express himself to the world through using that word amore we are the mask of God let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just love you and we thank you for your grace and for your mercy Lord I pray that in our lives you would just be glorified father that there would be nothing that we would hold back from you Lord that we could just set aside all of our former thinking all of our teaching if there's any Traditions Lord anything in our lives that would hinder your spirit from moving Lord I just pray that you would help us to just cast them down to just lay them aside to set them down and just walk towards you father and allow you to just reveal yourself to us in a greater way Lord we know that there's

message of the hour we thank you for a prophet that you would choose to reveal yourself to this age through Lord Jesus we pray that we could just now take the book ourselves and eat it that we could
