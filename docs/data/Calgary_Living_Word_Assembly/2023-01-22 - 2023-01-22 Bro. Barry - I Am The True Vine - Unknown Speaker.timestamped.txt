[27:15] it's a good day to be a Christian
[27:18] I was telling Brother Don on Mainstay
[27:21] like the Prairie parade was so
[27:23] remarkable it said that we are living on
[27:25] the day of the Lord and I was saying
[27:27] that
[27:28] it's the great day of the Lord for the
[27:29] believer
[27:30] but it's a dreadful day of the Lord
[27:33] for the unbelievers
[27:35] so it's a good thing to be a Christian
[27:37] let's bow to pray this morning
[27:40] father
[27:42] you truly mean the world to us Lord
[27:46] the reality Lord Jesus is we are not
[27:48] serving you because we want to escape
[27:51] hell
[27:53] we're saving you because of that love
[27:55] that we have for you
[27:58] Lord a prophet said if you were to cast
[28:02] him in hell
[28:03] he will still love you
[28:05] because he knows Lord Jesus Christ that
[28:08] he will make the right decision
[28:10] and if that's where you want him to be
[28:12] that's the place he wants to be Lord
[28:15] father that's the desire Lord Jesus we
[28:18] believe is in every heart Lord Jesus
[28:19] that we are not being dragged to come to
[28:22] church
[28:23] Lord Jesus we are not being persuaded to
[28:25] come to church
[28:27] but it's a love of fear between us and
[28:29] you their lord Jesus Lord whether we be
[28:32] in church whether in our homes in our
[28:34] places of work wherever we are Lord
[28:36] Jesus we are coming to realize more and
[28:39] more that we are representing you that
[28:42] we are Jesus Lord Jesus to the people
[28:44] that will come across us their father
[28:46] and we're here this morning Lord Jesus
[28:49] to check up with our soul salvation to
[28:52] feed Lord Jesus as Souls Lord with a
[28:54] living bread to the word of God father
[28:56] Lord as your servant will come this
[28:58] morning we pray Lord Jesus you take him
[29:01] out of the way there Lord Jesus father
[29:03] the word of God is a discerner of the
[29:05] thoughts and the intents of the hearts
[29:08] you know our needs dear Lord Jesus
[29:11] may you design those needs this morning
[29:13] may you meet each one at the point of
[29:16] our needs dear Lord Jesus father as we
[29:19] continue to worship you we know a lot of
[29:22] song service Lord Jesus is to make our
[29:25] hearts the right bedding ground to
[29:28] receive the word Lord may you continue
[29:30] to be with us song leader brother Paul
[29:33] their lord Jesus and all the musicians
[29:35] their father as they lead us Lord Jesus
[29:37] Christ father into the Shekinah glory
[29:40] Lord Jesus where all things are possible
[29:43] thou Lord our heart to be prepared to
[29:46] receive the word if there be anyone
[29:48] that's troubled here you take the
[29:50] trouble away if there's any pain Lord
[29:52] Jesus Christ father that is bothering
[29:54] every any one Lord Jesus may you take it
[29:57] away there Lord Jesus we just want to
[29:58] know that we came to church today and we
[30:01] met with Jesus we had a wonderful
[30:03] experience with you there Lord Jesus
[30:06] father the offering we're about to give
[30:08] Lord Jesus we realize their father the
[30:10] Lord is out of the substance you've
[30:12] given unto us that we are bringing and
[30:14] there's a promise Lord Jesus Christ that
[30:16] he will rebuke the Devourer for our sake
[30:18] Lord Jesus father this is not an
[30:21] inferior promise in the Bible Lord Jesus
[30:23] is the same Bible that promised us it's
[30:25] the same word of God that said our
[30:27] sickness is on our diseases Lord Jesus
[30:29] you will heal their father and Lord
[30:31] Jesus we are holding on to this word
[30:33] Lord if there be any Devourer Lord Jesus
[30:35] in our finances there Lord may you
[30:38] rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ
[30:40] father may I substance therefore that
[30:42] would give out of Lord Jesus Christ be
[30:45] an acceptable sacrifice unto you be with
[30:47] us for the rest of the service let us be
[30:49] careful to remember Lord to come back

[56:48] this morning with an uplift hand father
[56:51] Lord we know that you've created us to
[56:53] be needy and Lord It's contrary to this
[56:55] world but we thank you Father for the
[56:57] way that you've created us because you
[56:59] haven't created us to be a a a a a body
[57:03] of of Lord all the filth in this world
[57:06] but Lord You've created us to be a
[57:09] temple for your Holy Spirit to live in

[57:16] forwards Lord that you would help us to

[57:51] me step aside and just allow you father
[57:53] to use me and father the same for the
[57:55] hearer Lord oh Lord we pray the hear and

[58:08] will be careful to give you all the
[58:09] praise and all the Glory thank you for
[58:11] meeting each need according to your
[58:13] riches
[58:14] and your glory we just ask all these
[58:16] things now father in Jesus Christ's name
[58:19] we pray amen amen God bless you
[58:23] musicians
[58:24] thank you this morning
[58:27] just would like to welcome everyone
[58:30] to the house of the Lord
[58:34] I would like to take a moment to welcome
[58:36] Brother David and sister Christy from
[58:38] Nigeria
[58:39] I haven't seen you yet
[58:42] um I haven't made your acquaintance are
[58:44] they're here all right
[58:45] God bless you brother
[58:52] I looked right at you and I didn't
[58:53] recognize you
[58:55] and you know that's such an interesting
[58:56] Paradox because sometimes that can be
[58:59] the exact same thing with a Christian
[59:01] not recognizing Christ
[59:03] God bless you brother I pray that you
[59:05] feel right at home here I look forward
[59:07] to getting to know you
[59:09] um I just would like to actually mention
[59:11] also that uh we had a maybe while I talk
[59:16] just turn with me in your Bibles
[59:18] before I get to
[59:21] too inspired and keep you standing too
[59:23] long
[59:24] let's just read a scripture
[59:31] did Brother uh sorry John chapter 15.
[59:36] John chapter 15.
[59:38] your brother Mervin and sister Faye make
[59:39] it today
[59:44] yesterday but they didn't come today
[59:46] they're streaming today
[59:48] yes I understand fully I did the same
[59:51] thing last week God bless you brother
[59:53] Mervyn sister Faye and everyone else who
[59:56] might be tuning in virtually
[59:58] we certainly are
[1:00:01] blessed people
[1:00:03] to be able to gather together this way
[1:00:09] boy oh boy oh boy I apologize
[1:00:12] I feel a little bit nervous this morning
[1:00:15] St John chapter 15.
[1:00:17] verses 12 to 16 I'd like to read today
[1:00:25] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:00:27] another as I have loved you
[1:00:30] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:00:33] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:00:37] ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I
[1:00:40] command you
[1:00:42] henceforth I call you not servants
[1:00:46] for the servant knoweth not what his
[1:00:48] Lord doeth
[1:00:49] but I have called you friends
[1:00:53] for all things that I have heard of my
[1:00:56] father
[1:00:57] I have made known unto you
[1:01:00] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:01:03] you
[1:01:04] and ordained you
[1:01:06] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:01:09] and that your fruit should remain
[1:01:13] that whatsoever ye ask of the father in
[1:01:16] my name
[1:01:17] he may give it to you
[1:01:19] God bless you this morning let's just
[1:01:21] bow one more time
[1:01:24] uh
[1:01:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:01:30] you for your goodness to us
[1:01:32] we thank you for your loving kindness
[1:01:34] Lord
[1:01:36] father we pray that Lord the words that
[1:01:38] are spoken this morning Father your word
[1:01:40] your Eternal Word father that it would
[1:01:43] just find its Mark in the hearts of your
[1:01:46] children father
[1:01:47] Lord we pray that you would just be
[1:01:49] glorified in all that's said and done as
[1:01:51] we go forwards this morning in this
[1:01:53] service that when we leave here today
[1:01:55] father that we could say truly that our
[1:01:57] hearts burned within us because we know
[1:01:59] that you spoke with us along the way
[1:02:02] father we just ask that you would bless
[1:02:04] the reading of your word now in Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ's name we pray
[1:02:08] amen God bless you this morning you may
[1:02:11] be seated
[1:02:14] certainly uh an honor and a privilege to
[1:02:16] be back
[1:02:18] here in the house of the Lord
[1:02:21] with all of you
[1:02:23] it's a tremendous blessing to be able to
[1:02:26] travel but it's even more of a blessing
[1:02:28] to come home
[1:02:29] God bless you Sister Jermaine it's so
[1:02:31] good to see you happy New Years
[1:02:35] I just would like to uh I know I
[1:02:37] mentioned it on on
[1:02:40] Wednesday I certainly would like to
[1:02:42] thank all the brethren
[1:02:43] just for taking the time to step in and
[1:02:46] fill in for me while we were away
[1:02:49] I really appreciate that
[1:02:52] um
[1:02:53] certainly means something to know that
[1:02:55] we're together that we're not divided
[1:02:59] would just like to take a moment this
[1:03:01] morning also and have a special
[1:03:04] appreciation for Sister Janet o'donnello
[1:03:07] as brother Toby's mother she's with us
[1:03:10] today God bless you Sister
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:18] I didn't get to shake your hand in the
[1:03:19] back but I certainly look forward to
[1:03:21] doing it at the end of service I trust
[1:03:24] you feel right at home as well sister
[1:03:25] God bless you
[1:03:28] um I hope you can stay for quite a while
[1:03:29] as well
[1:03:33] you know the services that happened
[1:03:34] while we were away uh here were just
[1:03:37] tremendous and the services that we had
[1:03:40] over in Philippines were tremendous also
[1:03:43] I had a real battle going on I had to
[1:03:46] fight through a
[1:03:48] a head cold and a chest cold it was
[1:03:50] quite a deal but uh you know the Lord
[1:03:52] knows everything and it's such a a
[1:03:55] paradox when you know that you just want
[1:03:57] to curl up in a ball but there's a whole
[1:04:00] group of people just waiting to hear
[1:04:01] from you and uh
[1:04:03] so we just went forward by faith and and
[1:04:06] trusted the Lord and I believe it it
[1:04:08] worked well I think he blessed the
[1:04:09] services really well even when it felt
[1:04:12] like I failed terribly uh people were
[1:04:15] still commenting and were thankful for
[1:04:16] it so I certainly trust the Lord did
[1:04:19] something for the people there
[1:04:22] I know we are changed from what we
[1:04:25] witnessed the lives of the Believers
[1:04:27] that we met in Philippines it's such a
[1:04:30] tremendous thing to go and meet the
[1:04:32] people of Believers that attend in a
[1:04:35] congregation and you know Lord willing I
[1:04:37] would like to do it systematically go
[1:04:40] through the assembly and just go and
[1:04:41] meet the people in the other countries I
[1:04:43] don't know if that would be possible but
[1:04:46] one day we will all meet on the other
[1:04:48] side we know that and we will be
[1:04:50] together and we'll have all the time in
[1:04:52] the world
[1:04:53] to just share the stories of where we
[1:04:56] came from and the trials and
[1:04:57] tribulations that he delivered us from
[1:05:00] you know the story that brother Gilbert
[1:05:03] took in his service on the Wednesday
[1:05:06] that I and my father are one it's such a
[1:05:09] tremendous thought and I believe we
[1:05:11] could just take a an entire year and
[1:05:14] talk on that topic and you know Lord
[1:05:16] willing that's really what I want to do
[1:05:19] is talk about that and and that's really
[1:05:22] all I want to talk about to be honest
[1:05:24] with you but there's so much that we
[1:05:26] need to talk about we can't just stop in
[1:05:28] one spot but you know it's really the
[1:05:31] most important thing for us in our day
[1:05:33] because when the bride recognizes what
[1:05:36] she is when the church recognizes its
[1:05:39] position
[1:05:40] then the Rapture will go and you know we
[1:05:43] we've talked about our positions as
[1:05:45] husbands and wives and and children and
[1:05:47] and how it's been set out in Ephesians
[1:05:49] and brother Branham talks about how
[1:05:51] Ephesians perfectly parallels Joshua
[1:05:54] doesn't sort of parallel it but
[1:05:55] perfectly parallels Joshua how they were
[1:05:58] go going through delivered from the
[1:06:00] house of bondage and how they had to
[1:06:02] cross over Jordan die out to themselves
[1:06:03] change all of their ways and just accept
[1:06:06] the promise that God had for them
[1:06:09] same thing with the believer today we've
[1:06:12] got to recognize that we have been for
[1:06:14] ordained predestinated from before the
[1:06:17] foundation of the world to be called
[1:06:19] the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:23] we could get right into that but I don't
[1:06:24] want to spend too much time on that
[1:06:26] today I have another thought that the
[1:06:27] lord gave us but you know when Jesus was
[1:06:30] here on Earth and he sat down and said I
[1:06:33] and my father are one that's when they
[1:06:35] picked up the stones and that's when
[1:06:37] they wanted to kill him that's when they
[1:06:39] wanted to do away with this guy they
[1:06:40] loved his first pull and his second pull
[1:06:42] of his ministry when he could discern
[1:06:44] the hearts of people when he could heal
[1:06:45] people all the good things that were
[1:06:47] happening it was tremendous wasn't it oh
[1:06:50] but when he started to say you know what
[1:06:51] the word and I are one I and the father
[1:06:53] are one look out brother Branham says
[1:06:57] that that's when the shuck will start to
[1:06:59] pull away from the wheat when the bride
[1:07:02] starts to declare that when the wheat
[1:07:04] starts to declare that when the elected
[1:07:06] lady starts to declare that I and my
[1:07:09] father are one the Shuck's gonna freak
[1:07:10] out and say whoa you're getting crazy
[1:07:12] now you're getting a little bit
[1:07:13] fundamental but you know brothers and
[1:07:15] sisters that's what the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:16] Christ is
[1:07:18] she's a fanatic brother Branham says
[1:07:20] someone who is totally sold out to the
[1:07:22] word they're an oddball they're odd to
[1:07:24] the world around them aren't they
[1:07:26] that's what we'll be
[1:07:28] that's interesting because if you look
[1:07:30] at the world and all of the different
[1:07:31] people that have claimed Christianity
[1:07:33] and some of them very fundamental and
[1:07:36] and really even prophetic
[1:07:40] there's been some pretty crazy things
[1:07:41] that have happened under the guise of a
[1:07:43] prophet and and when you mention the
[1:07:45] word Prophet to people they get wigged
[1:07:48] out right away oh no you you know you're
[1:07:49] getting a little bit too far it's
[1:07:50] getting a little bit crazy now you're
[1:07:52] getting fundamental talking about a
[1:07:54] prophet but you know what there are true
[1:07:56] prophets and there are false prophets
[1:07:58] the false prophets are many the true
[1:08:01] prophets are few very few but the true
[1:08:04] Prophet will always align with the word
[1:08:06] of God the identification of a true
[1:08:09] Prophet will be that they point to Jesus
[1:08:10] Christ and a false prophet will point to
[1:08:13] some new doctrine some new theology that
[1:08:16] they've got to mix with the word of God
[1:08:18] some sort of hybridization that they
[1:08:21] want to bring in
[1:08:22] but you know I think it's just powerful
[1:08:24] it's just incredible that I and my
[1:08:26] father are one and I think the more that
[1:08:28] we actually go forwards and sing that
[1:08:29] song you know I was born to be a
[1:08:31] Dwelling Place
[1:08:32] for what
[1:08:34] for the father
[1:08:36] why so that we could die out so that we
[1:08:39] could decrease so that he could increase
[1:08:42] he has to live out through us but boy
[1:08:45] once he starts to do that brothers and
[1:08:46] sisters look out the the Devourer will
[1:08:49] be rebuked and you know it won't be just
[1:08:51] at his word it'll be at your word
[1:08:54] because you recognize when you speak he
[1:08:57] speaks
[1:08:59] I and my father are one
[1:09:01] just beautiful
[1:09:03] just love the thought that brother
[1:09:04] Emmanuel took I'm I just have to go over
[1:09:06] this because it's so powerful man don't
[1:09:08] look at the Giants the Giants weren't
[1:09:09] named in creation the Giants weren't
[1:09:11] named in God's word God said cross over
[1:09:14] Jordan die out to yourself go into the
[1:09:16] promised land take all that's yours the
[1:09:19] land of milk and honey is there just go
[1:09:21] do it but he didn't say Beware of the
[1:09:23] Giants
[1:09:25] because they weren't a part of his
[1:09:26] creation they were a perversion of his
[1:09:28] word
[1:09:29] but you know in our day brothers and
[1:09:31] sisters when we get into the book of
[1:09:33] Ephesians and we cross over we die out
[1:09:35] to ourselves what happens is we see
[1:09:37] Giants oh no there's Giants now what
[1:09:41] those Giants are a bluff the prophet of
[1:09:44] of our day he said those Giants are
[1:09:47] scarecrows and the scarecrows are only
[1:09:49] put up where the good things are they're
[1:09:52] only put up to scare the birds away but
[1:09:54] the birds know that they can actually
[1:09:56] get into something really good when they
[1:09:58] see a scarecrow so if a giant pops up in
[1:10:00] our lives brothers and sisters Rejoice
[1:10:02] Rejoice because you're rejoicing will
[1:10:05] destroy that giant you're complaining
[1:10:07] and you're crying won't destroy that
[1:10:09] giant you're complaining and crying will
[1:10:12] create a bigger giant in your life and
[1:10:14] maybe invite another giant to come
[1:10:16] around but boy when we can just rejoice
[1:10:18] and thank the Lord for what he's done in
[1:10:20] our lives that he has given us ears to
[1:10:22] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:10:24] church in the final days my goodness
[1:10:27] those scarecrows don't become problems
[1:10:29] anymore remember that brother Branham
[1:10:31] told that Vision about how the devil
[1:10:33] would come around and go boo
[1:10:35] right and every time that would happen
[1:10:38] he would get smaller and that devil
[1:10:40] would get bigger and every time he would
[1:10:43] do that he would get smaller and the
[1:10:44] devil would get bigger but then
[1:10:46] something spoke to him and said you know
[1:10:47] what say boo back
[1:10:49] and you know this can be taken and made
[1:10:51] into some weird Doctrine and I'm not
[1:10:53] interested in doing that what I am
[1:10:54] interested in doing is trying to
[1:10:56] encourage us to recognize when we hear
[1:10:58] that boo it's just a giant it's just a
[1:11:01] scarecrow say boo back devil
[1:11:04] we know that David he went and he
[1:11:07] withstood the Giant and the giant said
[1:11:09] oh my I'm going to feed you to the birds
[1:11:11] you little dog you think you're going to
[1:11:13] get away with this what a joke they
[1:11:15] would send out a little boy to try and
[1:11:17] kill me I'm a Warrior from my youth and
[1:11:20] you're just a youth
[1:11:22] and what did he say David said yeah
[1:11:24] you come to me where staves and Spears
[1:11:26] and you've got a sword but you know what
[1:11:29] it doesn't matter because I come to you
[1:11:31] in the name of the Living God
[1:11:33] I'm gonna cut your head off today
[1:11:37] and you know what it's not going to be
[1:11:38] us that does anything brothers and
[1:11:40] sisters it's us recognizing that we can
[1:11:41] do nothing
[1:11:42] but all things are possible
[1:11:45] to those who serve Christ
[1:11:48] we know that we can't do anything on our
[1:11:50] own
[1:11:51] and I'm not interested in trying to say
[1:11:53] that we can pump it up and make it some
[1:11:55] sort of Pentecostal religion that's not
[1:11:57] what it's about it's about recognizing
[1:11:58] our position in Christ and Christ's
[1:12:00] position in us when we come to that
[1:12:02] realization then the Rapture is going to
[1:12:04] go I'm not interested in trying to slay
[1:12:05] Giants down here who cares about the
[1:12:08] Giants down here we've got a promise up
[1:12:10] there
[1:12:14] or the Toby talking about showing our
[1:12:16] talents we've been given talents and and
[1:12:19] we can take them and and use them for
[1:12:21] God's glory or we can actually just go
[1:12:23] and hide them
[1:12:24] and you know there's many different
[1:12:26] talents in many different ways that we
[1:12:27] can actually show appreciation to the
[1:12:30] Lord for the talents which he's given us
[1:12:32] many different ways I don't want to try
[1:12:34] and pull on us one way or another but
[1:12:36] you know brothers and sisters if God's
[1:12:37] given us a talent we can use it
[1:12:39] spiritually speaking in the house of the
[1:12:41] Lord we can excuse me use it spiritually
[1:12:43] speaking for the body of Christ
[1:12:46] we can also use the god-given talents
[1:12:48] naturally in our lives sometimes he's
[1:12:51] given us a creative ability some people
[1:12:53] can draw pictures like we can imagine
[1:12:56] them some people have been given a
[1:12:58] tremendous Talent some people can
[1:13:00] coordinate things some people can build
[1:13:04] things we all have been given talents
[1:13:06] and you know what we have the ability to
[1:13:08] use them or hide them and I believe this
[1:13:10] the more that we use them the more that
[1:13:12] God will bless them
[1:13:14] because we know that this this this
[1:13:16] scripture that we read this morning John
[1:13:18] chapter 15 what does he say the very
[1:13:21] first verse we talked about this in
[1:13:22] Philippines I am the True Vine
[1:13:26] and my father is the husbandman every
[1:13:29] branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[1:13:32] taketh away
[1:13:34] but every batch that rareth fruit he
[1:13:36] purges it that it may bring forth more
[1:13:39] fruit
[1:13:40] so brothers and sisters if we've got
[1:13:41] something in our lives that we can do
[1:13:43] for the Lord that God has given us he's
[1:13:45] placed it in our lives if we have a gift
[1:13:47] God's given it to us it's not something
[1:13:49] we just found along the road somewhere
[1:13:51] along the way and said hey I just got
[1:13:53] this God gave it to us before the
[1:13:55] foundation of the world for a purpose
[1:13:58] the more that we use that gift for God
[1:14:00] the more that he'll bless it the more
[1:14:02] that we thank the Lord for the gifts
[1:14:04] that he's given us in our lives the more
[1:14:06] he will bless it
[1:14:10] so I think it's just wonderful we can
[1:14:12] show our appreciation for those talents
[1:14:13] by using them for the glory of God
[1:14:16] blessing the body blessing a brother or
[1:14:18] sister who however blessing our
[1:14:20] neighbors we were having a discussion I
[1:14:22] was on a discussion yesterday it was
[1:14:23] just so wonderful you know it's easy to
[1:14:25] say God bless you to a Believer to a
[1:14:27] brother and a sister in Christ Jesus
[1:14:29] that believe that God sent a prophet for
[1:14:30] the message of the hour
[1:14:32] uh but can we say God bless you the same
[1:14:35] way that we would say it
[1:14:36] to someone that believes in the trinity
[1:14:40] oh my someone that's a trinitarian could
[1:14:42] we go and shake their hands and say God
[1:14:43] bless you
[1:14:45] I sure love and appreciate you because I
[1:14:47] know you're a good person and I know
[1:14:49] it's not up to me to say that one person
[1:14:51] gets in or one person goes out one
[1:14:53] person is wise virgin and another person
[1:14:55] is foolish virgin that's not up to me to
[1:14:57] do it's up to God to do
[1:15:00] but it goes even further could you
[1:15:02] imagine being in a position where you
[1:15:04] have the opportunity to sacrifice your
[1:15:07] position in Christ
[1:15:09] for somebody else's life
[1:15:12] could we do that
[1:15:14] this is just a thought I'm not trying to
[1:15:16] bring a Doctrine or anything but you
[1:15:17] know what this totally dovetails with
[1:15:19] the scripture because we know that that
[1:15:21] Jesus said hey you know what there's no
[1:15:24] greater thing that a man could do than
[1:15:26] to lay down his life for his friends and
[1:15:29] that's just before the scripture that we
[1:15:30] read today could we lay down our life
[1:15:32] for our friends or we have too much to
[1:15:34] live for
[1:15:35] what is the talent that we've been given
[1:15:38] we have an ability in our lives
[1:15:41] we should use it for the glory of God
[1:15:44] you know I heard this said one time and
[1:15:46] you know just forgive me because it's
[1:15:48] not message I'm not saying that it is
[1:15:50] but I heard it said the most valuable
[1:15:52] real estate in the world is a cemetery
[1:15:55] and the reason for that is because so
[1:15:58] many people had been given god-given
[1:16:00] talents
[1:16:01] but they never used them
[1:16:03] for whatever reason
[1:16:05] and they take those talents right to the
[1:16:06] Grave
[1:16:08] think about all the different blessings
[1:16:10] that people could have given to mankind
[1:16:12] they could have given to their families
[1:16:14] they could have given to their brothers
[1:16:15] their sisters their churches whatever it
[1:16:17] is but they just didn't do it why don't
[1:16:20] people do things why don't people act on
[1:16:21] things the imagination that happens is
[1:16:24] because of fear it's because they're
[1:16:25] afraid it's because there's a scarecrow
[1:16:28] maybe when they were young they stood up
[1:16:30] and they had an inspiration and they
[1:16:31] said something and their children other
[1:16:33] children in the classroom made fun of
[1:16:35] them and it shocked them into never
[1:16:37] wanting to put themselves out there ever
[1:16:39] again to make make known an idea or a
[1:16:42] suggestion that was given to them maybe
[1:16:43] a parent humiliated them maybe a pastor
[1:16:46] humiliated them maybe someone somewhere
[1:16:49] along the way did something to shock
[1:16:51] that person
[1:16:52] but brothers and sisters I want to say
[1:16:54] this if you've got an inspiration and
[1:16:56] it's not contrary to God's word it's a
[1:16:59] gift that God's given you don't be
[1:17:00] bashful about it
[1:17:02] see what God will do with it all the
[1:17:05] talents that God has given us
[1:17:07] they're for a purpose
[1:17:10] but you know the Giants
[1:17:12] we've heard it said the Giants they're
[1:17:14] going to boast
[1:17:16] brother Peter would you mind grabbing my
[1:17:18] bottle of water from the back apologize
[1:17:21] I'm still kind of getting over
[1:17:24] uh this thing
[1:17:27] the Giants are going to boast in our
[1:17:30] land brothers and sisters we're all
[1:17:31] going to contend with Giants and they're
[1:17:33] going to say you are not one with your
[1:17:35] father that's going to be one of the
[1:17:37] primary things they're going to say when
[1:17:39] you start to say you know what I believe
[1:17:40] I I read this scripture and it gets me
[1:17:42] so excited I hear the message and I
[1:17:44] start to get so excited thank you so
[1:17:45] much brother it does something to me
[1:17:47] when I hear it
[1:17:48] I start to get inspired to say yeah man
[1:17:51] I I actually start to feel like I and my
[1:17:54] father are one Satan's going to come
[1:17:56] around and say nope you're getting crazy
[1:17:57] now nobody's going to want to hear that
[1:18:00] business don't even talk like that
[1:18:01] people are going to say you're crazy but
[1:18:03] you know what that's exactly where we
[1:18:05] need to come to brothers and sisters the
[1:18:07] devil is going to say you are not one
[1:18:09] the devil is going to say no you need to
[1:18:10] be afraid you need to be afraid when we
[1:18:13] hear Brother Bradham talk about being
[1:18:15] able to speak the word why cry speak
[1:18:18] when we think wow I can get inspired by
[1:18:20] that and think you know maybe I should
[1:18:22] speak the word when something happens in
[1:18:24] my life maybe I can see a problem and I
[1:18:26] can speak the word why do I need to cry
[1:18:27] I don't need to phone anybody I should
[1:18:29] just speak the word but the devil's
[1:18:31] gonna say no no no you're going to
[1:18:32] embarrass yourself your family's gonna
[1:18:34] hear you say it and nothing's going to
[1:18:35] happen and they're all going to think
[1:18:36] you're crazy because you're trying to
[1:18:38] speak the word you're trying to Trump
[1:18:39] something up maybe you're trying to get
[1:18:41] a little bit Pentecostal brothers and
[1:18:43] sisters you know what brother Branham
[1:18:44] said he said penny cost is an experience
[1:18:47] it's not a denomination and you know
[1:18:49] what if we've got an experience that's
[1:18:50] anything different than Pentecostal
[1:18:52] brothers and sisters I say check that
[1:18:53] experience maybe check it at the door
[1:18:55] because when we get inspired by the word
[1:18:57] of God something happens inside of us we
[1:19:00] have a reaction to the word of God
[1:19:02] there's something that we can't contain
[1:19:04] but you know brother Branham even said
[1:19:06] this too he said religion without
[1:19:08] emotion is what
[1:19:10] it's dead it's dead so take that
[1:19:13] religion and just bury it is what he
[1:19:15] says we don't need to hang on to a
[1:19:17] religion that's dead why would we want
[1:19:18] to be emotionless why would we want to
[1:19:21] say maybe my culture has been this way
[1:19:22] so I need to have a fear of getting too
[1:19:25] excited what's it going to be like when
[1:19:27] we get over there and all of Heaven is
[1:19:29] going to be quiet for those who are
[1:19:31] redeemed those redeemed ones are going
[1:19:33] to shout they're going to jump they
[1:19:35] might dance before the Lord
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:38] you know as this Revelation breaks in
[1:19:40] our lives brothers and sisters we don't
[1:19:42] have to wait till then we don't have to
[1:19:44] wait till then
[1:19:47] the prophet said focus on the scarecrows
[1:19:51] because they're a lie
[1:19:53] they're a lie now that's me paraphrasing
[1:19:55] what the prophet said but I want to say
[1:19:57] it that way just just focus on what the
[1:19:59] scarecrows are trying to do in our lives
[1:20:01] brothers and sisters they're a lie go
[1:20:03] into where the scarecrows are go look at
[1:20:05] those scarecrows brother Branham says it
[1:20:07] you know when he's preaching you know
[1:20:09] when I eat cherry pie I want to eat the
[1:20:11] pie it's my favorite pie but if I get a
[1:20:13] pit I don't throw the whole pie out and
[1:20:16] and if I'm eating chicken I I don't
[1:20:18] throw the chicken out if I get a little
[1:20:20] gristle or a bone
[1:20:21] he says go on and just throw out those
[1:20:23] little things that you don't like
[1:20:25] but don't throw it all out
[1:20:27] take the good stuff and eat it enjoy it
[1:20:30] it's free
[1:20:33] but he said before you throw it out take
[1:20:34] it and examine it and just make sure
[1:20:36] that it's a bone
[1:20:37] [Laughter]
[1:20:39] don't just throw it out because it just
[1:20:41] maybe is a little bit hard because it
[1:20:43] might be something that we need
[1:20:46] you know brothers and sisters if we want
[1:20:48] it there's always something there for us
[1:20:51] my the brother brought me a drink and
[1:20:54] I didn't even have any
[1:20:58] you know thinking about 2023
[1:21:01] and uh
[1:21:04] the importance of
[1:21:06] living as a human being we need to set
[1:21:08] ourselves goals we need to set ourselves
[1:21:12] achievements we need to work in our
[1:21:14] lives we need to go to school
[1:21:17] we need to strive
[1:21:20] you know what it says in the word of God
[1:21:21] that if we don't work then we shouldn't
[1:21:24] eat
[1:21:25] how could we want to eat food if we're
[1:21:27] not willing to get out of bed and go and
[1:21:29] work and that's me heavily paraphrasing
[1:21:32] it but you know we need to go forwards
[1:21:34] and we need to do things in our lives
[1:21:36] and you know if if we're not happy with
[1:21:38] the way things are in our lives then we
[1:21:40] can make a change to see something
[1:21:42] different in our lives and if we're
[1:21:44] willing to make a change in our lives
[1:21:45] then probably we're going to see a
[1:21:47] change in our lives if we're not willing
[1:21:49] to make a change or do anything
[1:21:51] different then we're only going to get
[1:21:52] what we've always got we're just going
[1:21:54] to have the same thing tomorrow and the
[1:21:56] same thing next day and I'm a witness of
[1:21:58] that I've lived my life like that at
[1:22:00] times but if we want to make a change
[1:22:02] brothers and sisters make a change
[1:22:05] let's make a change and you know
[1:22:07] one of the biggest things that I learned
[1:22:09] in business and and I'm not saying that
[1:22:12] you should apply it now in in the
[1:22:14] message of the hour what I'm saying is
[1:22:15] in our natural lives I I really highly
[1:22:17] encourage it if you want to make a
[1:22:19] change don't try and make a big change
[1:22:22] don't don't do anything too crazy all at
[1:22:24] once maybe God calls you to do something
[1:22:26] but you know many times we hear it
[1:22:28] people brother Branham talks about this
[1:22:30] just for the record he does in the
[1:22:32] message people set goals for the new
[1:22:33] year and then they find out the second
[1:22:35] or third day and they haven't met one of
[1:22:36] the goals they haven't done anything
[1:22:37] that they want to do because people set
[1:22:39] things that they can attain to
[1:22:42] but if you go and you start changing a
[1:22:44] whole bunch of things in your business
[1:22:45] all at once you can't tell what's
[1:22:46] actually making the difference there's
[1:22:48] nothing measurable the metrics are
[1:22:49] impossible to tell because you've pushed
[1:22:51] or pulled too many buttons or levers
[1:22:53] just do one little thing at a time
[1:22:56] and see if it doesn't help if it helps
[1:22:59] then then do it a little more and if it
[1:23:01] doesn't help then stop doing it and try
[1:23:03] something different but you know we can
[1:23:05] apply that principle to our spiritual
[1:23:07] lives brothers and sisters if we want
[1:23:09] more of God there's more of God to be
[1:23:10] had maybe we can come to church more
[1:23:12] maybe we could listen to the message
[1:23:14] more maybe we could come to prayer
[1:23:16] meetings more maybe we could just go on
[1:23:18] our knees and pray more maybe we could
[1:23:19] just read our Bible more maybe we can
[1:23:21] look at the Bible app maybe we can look
[1:23:23] at the message there's so many different
[1:23:24] things that we can do if we want to see
[1:23:27] a change spiritually we have the
[1:23:29] opportunity to do that
[1:23:31] just make a change
[1:23:33] you know if we keep doing what we've
[1:23:35] always done we're only going to get what
[1:23:36] we've always got
[1:23:38] but if we just create a new habit we
[1:23:41] talked about this I don't know if did we
[1:23:43] talk about this from Pulpit you know
[1:23:45] what a habit can be formed or broken in
[1:23:47] 21 days it's proven
[1:23:49] humanly speaking
[1:23:51] and I'm sorry some might say this is
[1:23:52] getting psychological but you know we
[1:23:55] live in a natural body and there's
[1:23:57] things that we need to learn about these
[1:23:59] bodies and if we want to start something
[1:24:01] new in our lives do it for 21 days and
[1:24:04] see if it doesn't stick and if we want
[1:24:06] to stop doing something in our lives
[1:24:07] stop doing it for 21 days and see if it
[1:24:10] doesn't get easier to stop but you know
[1:24:13] there's things in our lives that we
[1:24:15] can't control
[1:24:17] and if we can't stop something in our
[1:24:19] lives
[1:24:20] just take it to the Lord and see if he
[1:24:22] won't help you because I honestly
[1:24:24] believe this because I've experienced it
[1:24:26] I've tried many times on my own to stop
[1:24:28] things that I could just never control
[1:24:31] never deal with it on my own but boy oh
[1:24:34] boy just get sincere once with the Lord
[1:24:35] about that one thing that you can't
[1:24:37] control and see if he won't actually
[1:24:38] intercede see if he won't come on the
[1:24:40] scene and change it he will change it
[1:24:42] entirely
[1:24:45] so many different things that we could
[1:24:46] talk about and I really don't want to
[1:24:48] want to do that anymore but I just think
[1:24:51] this this this brother Gilbert has
[1:24:53] talked about this in the past and and I
[1:24:55] think it's such an important thing if
[1:24:57] we're going to set goals and and try and
[1:24:59] do something positive in our lives maybe
[1:25:01] it could be our family for our family
[1:25:03] maybe it could be just for ourselves
[1:25:05] personally maybe it could be for our
[1:25:07] church
[1:25:08] who knows God will lead us and guide us
[1:25:10] if we ask him
[1:25:12] but brother Branham talks about
[1:25:13] complexes
[1:25:15] and and out of questions and answers he
[1:25:17] says when a person realizes he has an
[1:25:19] inferior complex or some sort of a
[1:25:22] complex how may he overcome this and I
[1:25:24] want to say this I I think that we could
[1:25:26] take it and say maybe not an inferior
[1:25:29] complex maybe something that we just
[1:25:31] can't overcome maybe it's something that
[1:25:33] we want to do but have never been able
[1:25:34] to do it
[1:25:37] brother Branham goes on to say so should
[1:25:39] it be if he was the only child caused
[1:25:42] this in his early youth sometimes we get
[1:25:44] things that happen in our lives when
[1:25:46] we're an only child
[1:25:47] we don't learn how to interact with
[1:25:49] those people around us
[1:25:50] I just think this is really important
[1:25:52] brother Branham says take exactly the
[1:25:54] opposite if you want to change it just
[1:25:56] take the opposite
[1:25:58] and I love the way he words this it's
[1:26:00] it's kind of maybe even a little sharp
[1:26:02] but he says if you're always wanting
[1:26:04] your way and that one little brat that
[1:26:08] always wants
[1:26:10] to always have everything your way
[1:26:13] how many people could say that they
[1:26:15] could actually fit that maybe take the
[1:26:17] brat part out of there but how many
[1:26:19] people here have always wanted
[1:26:20] everything to be your way I could raise
[1:26:22] my hand and say there's times in my life
[1:26:24] where I say I want everything to be my
[1:26:25] way brother Branham he says turn right
[1:26:28] back around and give everything you got
[1:26:31] the other way
[1:26:33] if we've got this thing in our lives
[1:26:35] that we want to see changed do the
[1:26:38] opposite
[1:26:39] just do the opposite don't hang on to
[1:26:41] our will and say no I need everything to
[1:26:43] be my way because if you do that is that
[1:26:45] Christ's life that's not Christ's life
[1:26:48] Christ laid down his life for everyone
[1:26:50] else
[1:26:52] he says if you're selfish and you want
[1:26:54] to hold everything then start giving
[1:26:55] away what you got see
[1:26:58] whatever just go vice versa that's the
[1:27:01] way to overcome anything
[1:27:03] he's an antidote that's out of questions
[1:27:04] and answers in 1964.
[1:27:07] moving forward brothers and sisters 2023
[1:27:09] if we want to see a change do the
[1:27:10] opposite
[1:27:12] just change something just do it a
[1:27:13] little bit don't don't try and do
[1:27:14] anything too dramatic all at one time
[1:27:16] because it can get a little crazy but if
[1:27:19] you just try a little tiny change it can
[1:27:21] go a long ways maybe just pray through I
[1:27:25] asked the Lord a while ago what does it
[1:27:27] mean to pray through what does it mean
[1:27:29] to pray through and I'm sure everyone
[1:27:31] here should be able to raise their hands
[1:27:32] and say Amen brother I know what it
[1:27:34] means to pray through but if you don't I
[1:27:36] want to tell you what it means it means
[1:27:37] to just get into that place where no
[1:27:40] worldly influence is with you now you
[1:27:42] come into the presence of God and
[1:27:44] there's no more worldly thoughts you're
[1:27:46] not thinking about your phone you're not
[1:27:48] thinking about your job you're not
[1:27:49] thinking about your family you're not
[1:27:50] thinking about your hunger you're not
[1:27:52] thinking about your church you're not
[1:27:53] thinking about anything else but what
[1:27:55] God is actually leading you to pray
[1:27:57] about because when you come to that
[1:27:58] place where you're no longer praying and
[1:28:00] he's praying you've prayed through
[1:28:03] then you've prayed through until you get
[1:28:05] to that place brothers and sisters it's
[1:28:07] still carnality we're just on our knees
[1:28:09] and we're just having a conversation
[1:28:10] with ourselves but you know what if
[1:28:12] you're knocking on the door if you're
[1:28:14] knocking on the door to Heaven keep
[1:28:15] knocking on the door to Heaven keep
[1:28:16] knocking because he'll answer and boy
[1:28:18] when he answers you'll know that he's
[1:28:20] answered when he answers he answers in
[1:28:23] such a way that you know he begins to
[1:28:25] speak things that you don't even realize
[1:28:27] you can't even understand it because
[1:28:30] it's groanings that come from the spirit
[1:28:34] talking about our scripture today
[1:28:37] Saint John chapter 15.
[1:28:39] verse 11 these things have I spoken unto
[1:28:42] you that my joy
[1:28:44] might remain in you
[1:28:46] and that your joy might be full
[1:28:49] remember the word of God says the joy of
[1:28:52] the Lord is your strength
[1:28:56] where does our strength come from it
[1:28:58] comes from the Lord
[1:29:01] John
[1:29:02] chapter 15 the beginning of it I won't
[1:29:06] get into it today but he he talks about
[1:29:08] the vine and the branches when we were
[1:29:09] in Philippines there was so much green
[1:29:12] foliage everywhere I just it really
[1:29:14] struck me really spoke to me the vine
[1:29:17] and the branches and that life that we
[1:29:19] we talk about brother Brana mentions the
[1:29:22] citrus tree and how you can graft
[1:29:24] branches in and years ago I showed the
[1:29:26] picture of the tree who was a citrus
[1:29:28] tree I think it was a lemon tree but it
[1:29:29] had I think I want to say 40 different
[1:29:32] types of blossoms in it you could look
[1:29:34] it up on Google but grafted in branches
[1:29:37] and it was In Bloom in in the springtime
[1:29:39] and it had so many different colors it
[1:29:41] looked like fireworks all in one all of
[1:29:44] those branches from different trees
[1:29:46] living off of the same Vine living off
[1:29:48] of the same life and though none of
[1:29:50] those branches could go forth and bring
[1:29:52] fruit from the same tree they would only
[1:29:55] bear the fruit that was in them from
[1:29:57] before they were grafted in from the
[1:29:59] tree the original tree they were in
[1:30:02] but this this scripture here John
[1:30:04] chapter 15 he's talking about being the
[1:30:07] True Vine the one uh with the life the
[1:30:11] real true life in him and verse 11 says
[1:30:15] these things have I spoken unto you that
[1:30:16] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:30:19] joy might be full
[1:30:21] this is my commandment that ye love one
[1:30:24] another is I have loved you
[1:30:27] how will the world know that you love me
[1:30:30] different scripture I'm not reading this
[1:30:32] out of here
[1:30:33] that you have love one for another not
[1:30:34] that you say God sent a prophet not that
[1:30:36] I go to a message church not that I've
[1:30:37] served God for 75 years of my life or
[1:30:40] I've served God for five years of my
[1:30:42] life nothing that I could ever do on my
[1:30:44] own it's just simply one thing that you
[1:30:45] have love one for another
[1:30:48] greater love hath no man than this
[1:30:51] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:30:54] friends remember brother Branham said
[1:30:56] very clearly eternal life is living for
[1:30:58] others that's right it's putting others
[1:30:59] first and saying no no it's not about me
[1:31:02] it's about my brother no it's not about
[1:31:04] me it's about my sister I want to see
[1:31:07] them succeed verse 14 ye are my friends
[1:31:10] if ye do whatsoever I command you
[1:31:13] and this is where I'm going to get to
[1:31:15] today but how does he command us
[1:31:17] we know that he spoke to his disciples
[1:31:19] there but there was a time
[1:31:22] where he actually chose to speak through
[1:31:24] a prophet and that never changed did it
[1:31:27] some people will say Well when Jesus
[1:31:29] came it did change but many times we'll
[1:31:31] look past some of the scriptures that
[1:31:34] actually say no that's not the case
[1:31:35] verse 15 says henceforth I call you not
[1:31:38] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:31:40] what his Lord doeth
[1:31:43] the servant just serves
[1:31:45] but I've called you friends for all
[1:31:47] things that I have heard of my father I
[1:31:49] have made known unto you
[1:31:53] that's kind of what I want to get into
[1:31:54] today brothers and sisters is
[1:31:56] understanding that he has made known
[1:31:58] these things unto us but how has he done
[1:32:02] it it's it's too simple it's through a
[1:32:04] Vindicated Prophet but many times people
[1:32:06] don't want to get there they they get
[1:32:08] uneasy when we're talking about a
[1:32:09] prophet and I know we're preaching to
[1:32:11] the choir everybody here believes that
[1:32:12] God sent a prophet but we don't need to
[1:32:15] stop there I guess is my point we don't
[1:32:17] want to stop there that God sent a
[1:32:19] prophet we want to understand that the
[1:32:21] god that sent the prophet is now the god
[1:32:23] that's here with us and not just here
[1:32:25] with us but living out in us he's here
[1:32:28] with us speaking to us making known all
[1:32:31] that the father hath given him because
[1:32:33] verse 16 says that ye have not chosen me
[1:32:36] but I have chosen you
[1:32:39] and ordained you that ye should go forth
[1:32:42] and bring forth fruit I think it's just
[1:32:44] perfect with what mother Toby said he
[1:32:47] said that he would rebuke the Devourer
[1:32:49] for our sakes when we give our tithe and
[1:32:52] our offering it's not about a return on
[1:32:54] investment in time in terms of money if
[1:32:56] that's what we're doing it for we're
[1:32:57] doing it for the wrong reason it's just
[1:32:58] exactly the same thing as saying you
[1:33:00] know what I'm going to serve God because
[1:33:01] I'm afraid to go to hell
[1:33:03] it's not the right principle
[1:33:05] but if we get our heart right and say
[1:33:07] you know what I serve him because I love
[1:33:08] him because he first loved me he called
[1:33:10] me before the foundation of the world
[1:33:12] and gave me ears to hear what the spirit
[1:33:13] said if we can get to that place then
[1:33:15] we're serving God for the right purpose
[1:33:17] if we can get to the place to recognize
[1:33:19] that you know what there's a principle
[1:33:21] in the Bible that says he'll rebuke the
[1:33:23] Devourer for our sakes it'll be a
[1:33:24] financial blessing but it'll also be a
[1:33:26] spiritual blessing and it'll also be a
[1:33:27] physical blessing he will give us the
[1:33:29] ability to see our family healed he will
[1:33:32] give us the ability to see our children
[1:33:33] saved he'll give us the ability to see
[1:33:35] the spiritual growth in in our lives ye
[1:33:38] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[1:33:40] and ordained you that ye should go forth
[1:33:42] and bring forth fruit
[1:33:44] not that you should perish and be afraid
[1:33:47] and be scared of the Giants no you
[1:33:50] should be able to stand there and say
[1:33:51] you know what if there's a giant that
[1:33:52] comes around you know if I have to I'll
[1:33:56] cut your head off Giant and I won't do
[1:33:58] it with a sword or a spear I won't do it
[1:34:01] with a bow or an arrow I'll do it with
[1:34:02] the word of God because I recognize that
[1:34:05] I have not been given the spirit of
[1:34:07] bondage again to fear but I have been
[1:34:09] given the spirit of power and a spirit
[1:34:11] of love and a spirit of a sound mind I
[1:34:14] don't have to be upset when the Giants
[1:34:16] start coming around
[1:34:18] amen verse 14 and 15 he says ye are my
[1:34:21] friends if ye do whatsoever I command
[1:34:24] you
[1:34:24] amen but how does he command us through
[1:34:27] a prophet
[1:34:28] he gives us a Vindicated Prophet that's
[1:34:30] how he commands us are we willing to
[1:34:33] follow all that the prophet said or is
[1:34:36] there some part some portion of the
[1:34:37] Prophet what he said that we're just
[1:34:39] willing to leave out because if we do
[1:34:41] that brothers and sisters we're not
[1:34:42] taking all of his word
[1:34:45] remember there's billions of people out
[1:34:48] there that claim Jesus Christ and they
[1:34:50] claim Jesus blood but when you talk
[1:34:53] about Jesus words you have indicated
[1:34:55] Prophet you're getting a little bit
[1:34:58] crazy you're getting a little bit too
[1:34:59] far but I want to say this what really
[1:35:00] happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:03] everybody knows here everybody knows but
[1:35:06] I know there's some people that will
[1:35:07] watch this later on some people might be
[1:35:10] watching it right now that would say you
[1:35:11] know I can listen to all this profit
[1:35:13] stuff but I can't get past that but what
[1:35:15] really happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:18] it wasn't just a piece of fruit that Eve
[1:35:21] went out and ate we know that she
[1:35:23] contravened the word of God
[1:35:25] and all of the Christians all around the
[1:35:28] world would say that that's what caused
[1:35:29] the fall of mankind but why why was
[1:35:33] there two kids from one act we'll just
[1:35:35] leave it there
[1:35:36] Saint John 15 14. ye are my friends if
[1:35:40] you do whatsoever I command you
[1:35:42] amen verse 15 henceforth I call you not
[1:35:44] servants this is where I really want to
[1:35:46] get to today brothers and sisters we
[1:35:48] talked a little bit about it on
[1:35:49] Wednesday but I believe there's so much
[1:35:50] here all that Christ God was he poured
[1:35:53] into Christ oh that Christ was he poured
[1:35:55] into his church but we know that once
[1:35:57] upon a time the church was the called
[1:35:59] out people from bondage out of Israel
[1:36:01] but now we're talking about the church
[1:36:04] going a little bit further henceforth I
[1:36:07] call you not servants for the servant
[1:36:09] knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I
[1:36:12] have called you friends for all things
[1:36:15] that I have heard of my father have I
[1:36:18] made known unto you
[1:36:20] I just want to say this brothers and
[1:36:21] sisters it's just such a beautiful
[1:36:23] thought I'm going to say it a few times
[1:36:25] have you ever heard this when you press
[1:36:28] play based on the scripture that we've
[1:36:30] just listened to I no longer call you
[1:36:32] servants but I call you friends you ever
[1:36:34] hear this when you press play
[1:36:36] good evening friends
[1:36:39] who's talking there
[1:36:42] that's exactly in line with the
[1:36:43] scripture from the word go when that man
[1:36:46] stepped him to the pulpit some people
[1:36:48] might say oh no you have to hear this
[1:36:50] and that and the other it's got to be
[1:36:51] thus saith the Lord or it's not the man
[1:36:53] you know we can just take it and make it
[1:36:55] something that it isn't but I just think
[1:36:56] it's so fantastic that's exactly the way
[1:36:59] God is hiding himself in simplicity
[1:37:03] but revealing himself in the same
[1:37:06] go and listen this afternoon brothers
[1:37:08] and sisters
[1:37:09] a henceforth call you not servants but I
[1:37:12] call you friends
[1:37:13] good evening friends
[1:37:16] the prophet in our day
[1:37:18] you know
[1:37:20] Exodus 23
[1:37:22] we talked about this maybe let's just
[1:37:24] turn over there quickly
[1:37:27] Exodus chapter 23.
[1:37:34] I'm gonna have to really get going here
[1:37:36] I apologize
[1:37:39] Exodus 23 verse 20 to 22 behold I sent
[1:37:43] an angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:37:45] way
[1:37:46] and to bring thee into the place which I
[1:37:49] have prepared
[1:37:51] we're talking about an angel in our day
[1:37:53] brothers and sisters we're looking back
[1:37:55] here we're talking about an angel in our
[1:37:57] day taking us to a place that he has
[1:38:00] prepared beware of him and obey his
[1:38:02] voice provoke him not for he will not
[1:38:04] pardon your transgressions
[1:38:07] for my name is in him
[1:38:09] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:38:11] and do all that I speak
[1:38:15] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:38:17] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[1:38:19] adversaries
[1:38:20] how did he speak
[1:38:23] he spoke to the prophet
[1:38:26] we know he's the same yesterday today
[1:38:28] and forever so then Hebrews or sorry
[1:38:31] then Exodus 20 verse 18 and all the
[1:38:34] people saw the thunderings and the
[1:38:35] Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet
[1:38:37] and the mountains smoking and when the
[1:38:38] people saw it they removed and stood
[1:38:40] afar off and they said unto Moses speak
[1:38:42] thou with us and we will hear but let
[1:38:45] not God speak lest we die don't let God
[1:38:48] talk to us they called for a prophet so
[1:38:51] God said hey I'll give you a prophet so
[1:38:53] if we believe Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ
[1:38:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:58] then how is he going to speak to us
[1:39:00] whose voice is it that we're going to
[1:39:02] hear say good evening friends it's going
[1:39:04] to be God himself
[1:39:08] God chose to speak to the people through
[1:39:10] a prophet
[1:39:12] or a messenger
[1:39:14] or an angel
[1:39:15] all of them are the same
[1:39:18] I just love this verse 16 of of John
[1:39:21] chapter 15. ye have not chosen me but I
[1:39:24] have chosen you and I've ordained you I
[1:39:27] have taken you from before the
[1:39:29] foundation of the world so that you
[1:39:31] could come and stand in Satan's Eden and
[1:39:33] not be defiled by this world there's
[1:39:35] only one thing that will move you and
[1:39:37] that is going to be the word of God
[1:39:39] that's going to be my word on the lips
[1:39:41] of a Vindicated Prophet that's going to
[1:39:43] stir your heart to the place where you
[1:39:44] might say I just don't understand it all
[1:39:46] but I believe it
[1:39:49] yesterday we had a baptism at the church
[1:39:51] here
[1:39:52] Sister Mary Jeanette has witnessed to a
[1:39:54] man his name is Eric McKay
[1:39:57] and uh he's 58 years old and he believes
[1:40:01] that he needed to be baptized in the
[1:40:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:06] so we had a great discussion and we
[1:40:08] talked about it I went and I picked him
[1:40:10] up he's at the Sunrise Center so he has
[1:40:13] a limited window of opportunity to go
[1:40:16] and do things and so I picked him up
[1:40:20] yesterday we came to the church after
[1:40:22] the musicians practice and uh and we
[1:40:24] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[1:40:26] Jesus Christ but the the discussion that
[1:40:29] we had was so wonderful because he he
[1:40:31] truly believes the word of God that he
[1:40:35] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:37] and that he doesn't change his ways it
[1:40:40] was such a wonderful conversation to to
[1:40:42] hear someone talk about it this is a man
[1:40:44] that's had a hard hard life
[1:40:46] he told me that he went into the
[1:40:48] residential school as a child as as I
[1:40:51] think six or seven years old into the
[1:40:54] residential system in Canada he
[1:40:56] experienced that and then he went into
[1:40:57] the the 60s thing whatever that was and
[1:41:00] just not a good story
[1:41:03] but somehow someway he wants to serve
[1:41:06] God
[1:41:07] there's something in him that says hey
[1:41:09] if God sent a prophet I want to know
[1:41:11] about it I want to hear about it tell me
[1:41:13] more
[1:41:16] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:41:19] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:41:21] forth and bring forth fruit and that
[1:41:23] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[1:41:24] ye shall ask of my father in my name he
[1:41:27] may give it to you
[1:41:30] you know we can look at this this the
[1:41:33] scripture and think you know many times
[1:41:35] it sounds good but how do we apply that
[1:41:38] in our lives
[1:41:40] how does that work because there's times
[1:41:42] where I ask and and I don't receive the
[1:41:45] Lord doesn't give it to me
[1:41:46] but you know the only way we're going to
[1:41:48] see a result like that like like we want
[1:41:50] to see come to pass in our lives is to
[1:41:52] ask according to his word
[1:41:55] it's got to be according to his word
[1:41:57] there's only one thing that he's
[1:41:58] interested in brothers and sisters he
[1:42:00] wants to see us Prosper he wants to see
[1:42:02] us in good health he wants to see us
[1:42:04] happy there's things that really he does
[1:42:06] want for us but more than anything
[1:42:08] there's one Paramount thing and that's
[1:42:10] our soul he wants our soul and he will
[1:42:13] not lose one but more than anything we
[1:42:16] need to be asking for things of Eternal
[1:42:18] value if we're asking for temporal
[1:42:21] blessings
[1:42:22] we might not get it or we might get it
[1:42:24] but it could be actually not a blessing
[1:42:27] in the long run it could turn into a
[1:42:28] curse for us we have to be very careful
[1:42:30] the way we ask
[1:42:33] just like we need to be very careful the
[1:42:35] way we speak
[1:42:37] if we're dealing with the third poll and
[1:42:38] we can not cry but speak the word of God
[1:42:41] be careful what we speak about one
[1:42:43] another
[1:42:44] it can be a terrible thing
[1:42:46] but you know the story just remains for
[1:42:49] me I can't get away from it you know
[1:42:50] when we talk about asking for Eternal
[1:42:52] things asking for things of Eternal
[1:42:54] value that's what God's going to give us
[1:42:56] remember the prophet of God told sister
[1:42:58] Hattie right you want a million bucks
[1:43:00] how much money was a million dollars
[1:43:02] back in in this when was that how much
[1:43:05] money was that then that was a lot of
[1:43:07] dough wasn't it you want it just say the
[1:43:10] word God will give it to you
[1:43:12] but she didn't want it
[1:43:13] what about your sister we've prayed for
[1:43:16] her and prayed for her this is the
[1:43:17] prophet of God saying we've prayed for
[1:43:19] her and prayed for her and she's still
[1:43:21] not healed she's still crippled in the
[1:43:23] wheelchair
[1:43:25] say the word she'll be healed right now
[1:43:27] what does she want there was something
[1:43:30] inside of her that recognized this was
[1:43:32] the only opportunity this was the time
[1:43:35] to ask for something of Eternal value
[1:43:37] and that Eternal value was for The Souls
[1:43:39] of her sons
[1:43:41] and what happened they were in the midst
[1:43:43] of mocking him and her mocking the
[1:43:45] situation but God took it and used it
[1:43:48] for his glory
[1:43:52] I call you friends
[1:43:54] his powerful brothers and sisters
[1:43:56] because I I believe it's a change in the
[1:43:59] dispensation and a change in the age a
[1:44:03] change in the way things are being
[1:44:04] perceived and we're not getting away
[1:44:07] from the message of the hour don't get
[1:44:08] me wrong I'm not I'm not at all trying
[1:44:10] to do that what I'm trying to do is just
[1:44:11] draw our attention to something
[1:44:16] Jesus said I call you friends in John 15
[1:44:19] 15.
[1:44:21] why why did he do that because all
[1:44:24] things that that he he has heard of his
[1:44:27] father he made known unto his friends
[1:44:29] the servants they don't get the
[1:44:30] information they don't they don't
[1:44:32] understand the conversation the personal
[1:44:34] conversation behind closed doors the
[1:44:36] servants just do what the servants do
[1:44:38] but the friends are the ones that are
[1:44:40] invited into the inner chamber they get
[1:44:42] to sit down and have Fellowship they get
[1:44:44] to break bread and talk about things and
[1:44:46] we know that he he said this very
[1:44:49] clearly
[1:44:50] um Jesus said to his disciples I have
[1:44:54] made all things known unto you what the
[1:44:56] father has given to me I talked about
[1:44:58] this on Wednesday and I felt like I just
[1:44:59] needed to go back and and just really
[1:45:01] dwell on this a little bit and we'll
[1:45:03] just see what the Lord will do with it
[1:45:04] but you know in the first seal brother
[1:45:07] radham says this
[1:45:08] now watch he said it would be known in
[1:45:11] the last day but it comes forth in a
[1:45:14] church symbol
[1:45:16] do you understand at church
[1:45:18] it comes forth in a symbol of a church
[1:45:20] that they know there is a seal but just
[1:45:23] what it is yet they don't know because
[1:45:25] it's a white horse rider
[1:45:27] and we know many times over the years
[1:45:29] over the centuries people have poked and
[1:45:32] prodded at this to try and figure out
[1:45:34] what it is and there's many different
[1:45:35] examples of it and I'm not going to get
[1:45:37] into it today
[1:45:39] brother Branham says it's a white horse
[1:45:41] rider and it's only is to be revealed
[1:45:44] that the last day when the actual seal
[1:45:46] is broken
[1:45:49] he says broken to who
[1:45:51] not to Christ
[1:45:52] but to the church
[1:45:54] it's broken to the church
[1:45:57] but here we have this one that said good
[1:45:59] evening friends
[1:46:01] speaking these words here in the first
[1:46:03] seal the one that was picked up by the
[1:46:06] seven angels the one that actually was
[1:46:08] there or not depending on how you want
[1:46:10] to argue it in Sunset mountain when that
[1:46:12] cloud picture was taken that one getting
[1:46:15] back to the cloud discussion
[1:46:17] why was that cloud there
[1:46:19] Cloud was there to show him to go back
[1:46:22] to Jeffersonville
[1:46:23] to be in his position
[1:46:25] so that that Covenant Angel could come
[1:46:27] and open the seals through him
[1:46:31] he says it's only to be revealed at that
[1:46:33] last day when this actual seal is broken
[1:46:35] broke into who not to Christ but to the
[1:46:38] church
[1:46:39] he says notice now oh my that just makes
[1:46:42] me tremble I hope that the church truly
[1:46:46] understands it see what I mean you
[1:46:48] people
[1:46:51] he says I'm going to call you bride see
[1:46:54] that you'll understand it
[1:46:57] isn't that interesting because it just
[1:46:58] dovetails with John St John 15 15.
[1:47:02] I no longer call you servants
[1:47:05] but I call you friends
[1:47:08] so that you'll understand it
[1:47:11] I'm going to call you bride see that
[1:47:13] you'll understand it
[1:47:15] he's now inviting the church to another
[1:47:18] level this is taking it to a whole new
[1:47:20] level brothers and sisters this isn't
[1:47:22] just being church members and saying
[1:47:23] that you know this is great we've got a
[1:47:25] fantastic Fellowship this is going
[1:47:27] Beyond and recognizing the opening of
[1:47:29] the seals isn't just the opening of the
[1:47:32] seals and we can say that we can
[1:47:33] understand line by line and read you
[1:47:35] know what it takes prophetic insight to
[1:47:38] recognize what the seals opening means
[1:47:41] and I'm not trying to say we've got this
[1:47:43] great mystery and it makes us some sort
[1:47:44] of elitism you know what if this seals
[1:47:47] truly become broken to you if you
[1:47:49] understand the mystery behind the seals
[1:47:51] then you become humble
[1:47:54] it doesn't puff us up Revelation does
[1:47:56] not puff a Christian person up
[1:47:58] Revelation humbles us Revelation makes
[1:48:01] us recognize out of 8 billion people God
[1:48:04] chose me to be able to understand this
[1:48:08] so when we see someone puffed up and
[1:48:10] they say oh yeah I know all about that
[1:48:11] and I know this and that and you know
[1:48:13] what's going on
[1:48:15] of course you don't want to
[1:48:17] make someone feel bad but we've got to
[1:48:20] be able to discern the spirits that's
[1:48:21] what the word of God says
[1:48:23] discern the spirits
[1:48:26] but he says I'm going to call you bride
[1:48:28] see so that you'll understand it now I
[1:48:29] just think it's important it's vital for
[1:48:31] us brothers and sisters to recognize who
[1:48:33] is saying those words was it a prophet
[1:48:35] was it a man on Earth saying those words
[1:48:37] or was it that Covenant Angel speaking
[1:48:39] through that man because if it was that
[1:48:40] Covenant Angel speaking to that man
[1:48:42] there was a tremendous change in
[1:48:44] dispensation happening right there in
[1:48:47] the first seal before he even starts
[1:48:50] right at the beginning of the seals he
[1:48:53] says that I'm not going to call you
[1:48:54] church I'm not going to call you
[1:48:55] servants I'm going to call you friends
[1:48:56] and you know what I'm not going to call
[1:48:58] your friends I'm going to call you bride
[1:48:59] I'm going to call you that one that I
[1:49:01] actually spoke about in Ephesians you
[1:49:03] know I don't speak concerning a man and
[1:49:05] a wife I speak about the mystery
[1:49:07] concerning God and the church Christ and
[1:49:09] the church how they could just become
[1:49:11] what to no one
[1:49:14] how they could become one and so
[1:49:16] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:49:18] really try and drill down on this today
[1:49:20] and talk a little bit about how brother
[1:49:22] Branham actually mentioned this so I've
[1:49:24] got some quotes
[1:49:25] I've got some quotes
[1:49:27] I just think it's so significant I want
[1:49:29] to dwell on it you know to some people
[1:49:31] this is where it becomes critical the
[1:49:33] Scarecrow pops up the seals you hear
[1:49:35] that word scarecrows pop up for some
[1:49:38] people they're not sure some people they
[1:49:40] might say well you know what all the
[1:49:42] seals are open praise God there's no
[1:49:44] scarecrow there for other people
[1:49:46] scarecrow pops up and they'll say well
[1:49:48] you know what brother
[1:49:50] some of the seals aren't open they're
[1:49:52] not all open yet it's a scarecrow and
[1:49:54] you know others will say you know what
[1:49:56] they're all open except for one
[1:49:58] it's a scarecrow
[1:49:59] because if you listen to the message of
[1:50:01] the hour he he refers to it very clearly
[1:50:03] them seals are open all them seals are
[1:50:07] open when all the seals were open he
[1:50:09] says it many different ways
[1:50:11] some folks will say it's laodicea but
[1:50:13] you know what brothers and sisters
[1:50:14] others will say it's a bright age
[1:50:16] this is not the layout of cnh for some
[1:50:19] people it might be we can look at all
[1:50:21] the church ages but you know we'll get
[1:50:24] there eventually but this is not the
[1:50:26] laodicean church age it is the bride age
[1:50:30] because we know that it was a Vindicated
[1:50:32] Prophet what made it a Vindicated profit
[1:50:34] it was the Covenant Angel speaking
[1:50:36] through the prophet who is the Covenant
[1:50:39] Angel brothers and sisters but Christ
[1:50:40] Jesus himself it's not some other Angel
[1:50:43] we spoke about it on Sunday it's not an
[1:50:45] archangel from Heaven it's not someone
[1:50:47] with a really great personality from
[1:50:49] Heaven it's Jesus Christ himself
[1:50:53] all things I have heard of my father I
[1:50:56] have made known unto you
[1:51:01] so as we go forwards I just think it's
[1:51:03] beautiful we're going to read some
[1:51:04] quotes now I got
[1:51:06] 15 maybe half an hour
[1:51:10] if we're pushing it
[1:51:11] as Christ was the first one to raise
[1:51:14] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:51:16] although typed in many places he was the
[1:51:19] first fruits of those that slept
[1:51:22] in the bride coming of Christ
[1:51:25] coming out of the church
[1:51:27] there will have to be a sheath waived
[1:51:30] again in the last days oh my
[1:51:33] he says waving of the Sheaf what was the
[1:51:36] Sheaf
[1:51:37] the first one
[1:51:39] to come to mature the first one that
[1:51:43] proved it was a wheat that proved it was
[1:51:47] a Sheaf
[1:51:49] we know we read that scripture unless
[1:51:50] the corn of wheat falls in the ground it
[1:51:52] abides alone
[1:51:53] but when it does come forth it brings
[1:51:56] forth much fruit doesn't it one corn and
[1:51:58] we know that each head contains multiple
[1:52:01] corns but if it just stays in a
[1:52:03] container somewhere it's never going to
[1:52:05] bring forth fruit that's why it's the
[1:52:07] life of a Believer we've got to die out
[1:52:09] to ourselves brother Marvin brought that
[1:52:10] that visual uh depiction of it how that
[1:52:14] life cycle happens it's got to be a
[1:52:16] rotten seed is the end of it brothers
[1:52:17] and sisters if we've got a seed in us
[1:52:19] it's got a rot we gotta die out to
[1:52:21] ourselves in order for him to live
[1:52:23] but we know out of Leviticus 20 that's
[1:52:25] what he was referring to here speak unto
[1:52:27] the children of Israel and say unto them
[1:52:29] when ye come into the land which I give
[1:52:31] you and shall reap the Harvest thereof
[1:52:34] then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first
[1:52:37] fruits of your Harvest unto the priest
[1:52:40] we know that's the Old Testament we know
[1:52:42] it's applicable today we're supposed to
[1:52:44] bring of a Sheaf of the first fruits of
[1:52:47] our Harvest whatever God gives us we're
[1:52:49] supposed to bring that to him and show
[1:52:51] him that and thank him for it and wave
[1:52:53] it before him not just go and do
[1:52:55] everything else and then say well if
[1:52:57] I've got something left over then I'll
[1:52:59] bring it to the Lord then we're bringing
[1:53:00] a sacrifice that stinks in his nose
[1:53:03] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:53:05] forever all that God was he poured into
[1:53:07] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:53:08] into the church
[1:53:12] and he shall wave the Sheaf before the
[1:53:14] Lord to be accepted for you on the
[1:53:18] morrow after the Sabbath the priest
[1:53:20] shall wave it and he shall offer that
[1:53:22] day when ye wave the Sheaf
[1:53:25] and he lamb without blemish of the first
[1:53:28] year for a burnt offering unto the Lord
[1:53:30] we know that there was a he lamb that
[1:53:33] was waived before the congregation we
[1:53:36] know that happened and that was for a
[1:53:37] purpose that was so that we could live
[1:53:39] speaking of Christ on Calvary
[1:53:42] another quote brother Bradham says he
[1:53:44] says hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[1:53:46] I'm talking about it was waived over the
[1:53:48] people and the first time there will
[1:53:50] come forth for the bride age for a
[1:53:53] resurrection out of dark
[1:53:55] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:53:58] will
[1:53:59] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:54:02] turned back again in its full power
[1:54:05] and being waived over the People by the
[1:54:08] same signs and wonders that he did back
[1:54:10] there all of that is probably a very
[1:54:12] familiar quote out of it is the rising
[1:54:15] of the Sun
[1:54:18] I personally believe it's so important
[1:54:21] to recognize there was a change in
[1:54:23] dispensation something has happened in
[1:54:25] in our day brothers and sisters and I
[1:54:27] just gonna interweave this in here that
[1:54:29] you know what brother Branham says it in
[1:54:30] the church age book that uh she has the
[1:54:32] mind of Christ
[1:54:34] to know what to do with the word right
[1:54:37] yeah that that quote is not just
[1:54:39] something that we want to brush over and
[1:54:40] I I say it but I I I want to understand
[1:54:43] it myself and I know the more that we
[1:54:45] say it the more it will become clear to
[1:54:48] us
[1:54:49] she has thus saith the Lord the Bride of
[1:54:52] Jesus Christ has thus saith the Lord we
[1:54:54] know this Vindicated Prophet that we're
[1:54:56] talking about he was told one time to go
[1:54:58] and pick up your pen and write this down
[1:54:59] because I don't want you to forget this
[1:55:01] I want you to tell the church this no I
[1:55:03] want you to tell the bride this I want
[1:55:05] her to understand this that all that God
[1:55:09] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:55:11] Christ was he didn't just pour it into
[1:55:13] the church he poured it into his bride
[1:55:15] in the last day and you know what
[1:55:17] brothers and sisters when the scarecrows
[1:55:19] pop up in our lives we have the ability
[1:55:21] to recognize that according to what the
[1:55:23] prophet of God says we are now in the
[1:55:25] bride age we're not living under
[1:55:26] laodicea we're not living under all the
[1:55:29] different dispensations we are truly
[1:55:31] living in the representation of Jesus
[1:55:34] Christ himself
[1:55:36] because if we have accepted his Spirit
[1:55:38] within us then who are we
[1:55:41] we can't be ourselves and him can we
[1:55:45] many times this flesh wants us to be
[1:55:47] but he's not going to share his glory
[1:55:49] with nobody
[1:55:50] not with nobody
[1:55:53] another quote brother Adam says brother
[1:55:56] let's get all things ready for one of
[1:55:58] these days the fire is going to fall
[1:56:01] I I know this is out of
[1:56:03] invisible Union
[1:56:06] have the actual heading at the bottom
[1:56:08] now I started taking the quotes out of
[1:56:10] the table so that's why I'm not saying
[1:56:11] the the origin of the quote to start
[1:56:14] with he says brother let's get all
[1:56:16] things ready for one of these days the
[1:56:17] fire is going to fall we're going up now
[1:56:20] let's get ready for the fire falling
[1:56:22] time we're in the last days
[1:56:24] you'll know that and we're ready for the
[1:56:25] coming of the Lord the thing to do is
[1:56:27] separate yourself from all sin separate
[1:56:30] yourself from anything that pertains to
[1:56:32] the world don't love the world or the
[1:56:34] things of the world
[1:56:36] let no man buy his Creed deceive you
[1:56:42] you stay right straight in the promise
[1:56:45] of God the word of God
[1:56:48] and that word if it's a word for this
[1:56:51] day God vindicates it so
[1:56:54] if he doesn't
[1:56:55] it's not the word for this day
[1:56:58] so brothers and sisters I want to say
[1:57:00] how many words have we heard in our day
[1:57:02] that God has Vindicated
[1:57:06] I personally want to say there's one
[1:57:08] and any time we see success in our lives
[1:57:11] spiritually speaking brothers and
[1:57:12] sisters the only way we're going to see
[1:57:14] it is to fall under that one word
[1:57:16] there's only one word and that word is
[1:57:19] the Vindicated Prophet for that day
[1:57:22] and you know what happens when we take
[1:57:24] that word into our lives and it becomes
[1:57:27] in our heart it becomes our own personal
[1:57:28] possession then it goes from being a
[1:57:31] word that's on print pages to being a
[1:57:34] Living Word
[1:57:35] it's not just an association to go to a
[1:57:38] church that's called Living Word it's
[1:57:40] actually the word living out
[1:57:44] he says no let no man deceive You by let
[1:57:47] no man by his Creed deceive you you stay
[1:57:50] right straight in the promise of God
[1:57:52] that word of God and that word if it's a
[1:57:54] word for this day God vindicates it so
[1:57:57] if he doesn't it's not the word for this
[1:57:59] day
[1:58:00] the word that fell on the day of
[1:58:02] Pentecost
[1:58:03] will not work for this day no sir that
[1:58:06] was for Pentecost
[1:58:08] this is for the bride
[1:58:13] going home of the Bride
[1:58:16] we got something different
[1:58:20] I just love that we got something
[1:58:22] different the Pentecostals represented
[1:58:24] that again
[1:58:26] we're in the bride age
[1:58:29] no more than the word of Noah would work
[1:58:32] in the days of Moses no more than Moses
[1:58:35] law would have worked in the time of
[1:58:36] Paul here he tried to tell them you are
[1:58:39] dead to that you cannot have that Church
[1:58:43] you who I'm speaking to tonight who is
[1:58:46] speaking here
[1:58:48] God himself Church you who I'm speaking
[1:58:51] to tonight Across the Nation if you've
[1:58:53] separated yourself from denomination all
[1:58:55] the filth and things of this world and
[1:58:58] all those things that keeps you in
[1:59:00] man-made Creeds and orders and things
[1:59:02] like that
[1:59:04] sorry
[1:59:08] you separate yourself look up get ready
[1:59:11] the fire is going to fall one of these
[1:59:13] days God is going to let him come
[1:59:16] and a sight to behold
[1:59:19] would you be ready when he comes would
[1:59:21] you be ready to go up
[1:59:23] with him when he comes
[1:59:27] the secret Rapture of the supernatural
[1:59:29] bride
[1:59:31] is not going to be a big cataclysmic
[1:59:33] event we've said this on Wednesday I
[1:59:35] just think it's so I don't know vital to
[1:59:37] say it
[1:59:39] the secret Rapture of the supernatural
[1:59:42] bride and what makes her Supernatural
[1:59:44] brothers and sisters now it's brother
[1:59:46] Barry and now I'm going to get inspired
[1:59:47] but what is it that makes her
[1:59:49] Supernatural it's not because she's got
[1:59:51] a first pull or a second pole Ministry
[1:59:54] or even a spoken word ministry I can say
[1:59:56] this is going to happen and it's going
[1:59:57] to happen the way that I say it or that
[1:59:59] I can discern things it's not it it's
[2:00:01] being able to receive the word for her
[2:00:04] day and say that word is my word it's
[2:00:07] not somebody else's word I'm not going
[2:00:09] to deviate there's no Creed or Dogma no
[2:00:12] traditional teaching that's going to
[2:00:14] take me and mix me up I'm only gonna
[2:00:16] take the word
[2:00:18] that's the supernatural portion of it
[2:00:21] because without that Supernatural
[2:00:22] portion you're going to say you know
[2:00:24] what some of this stuff is crazy you're
[2:00:25] talking about a prophet you're talking
[2:00:26] about seals you're talking about
[2:00:28] Mysteries you know I I could I can take
[2:00:30] all of it the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:00:32] Jesus and all of that maybe even the
[2:00:34] baptism of of in Jesus name but when you
[2:00:38] start going into who she and he are one
[2:00:42] that's when it starts to get a little
[2:00:43] bit crazy but you know what that's what
[2:00:45] we're called to brothers and sisters the
[2:00:46] supernatural portion is our ability to
[2:00:49] just say Amen to the word it's not being
[2:00:51] able to make it something else not
[2:00:52] having a big prayer line and seeing
[2:00:54] great wonderful signs and wonders in our
[2:00:56] church it's just being able to stay with
[2:00:58] that word
[2:00:59] I believe was it Martin someone probably
[2:01:02] knows I know it's getting time to close
[2:01:04] but was it Martin they said the brother
[2:01:06] Bradham said the the the most incredible
[2:01:09] thing was that he was able to stay above
[2:01:11] all the fanaticism in his ministry when
[2:01:13] God started to bless his ministry it
[2:01:15] wasn't all the signs and wonders it said
[2:01:16] he was able to stay above all the
[2:01:18] fanaticism it's the same thing for us
[2:01:20] today brothers and sisters as we receive
[2:01:22] this word it becomes a supernatural word
[2:01:24] in our lives
[2:01:26] that was out of the invisible Union
[2:01:29] another quote had to come forth in the
[2:01:32] Pentecostal for the restoration of the
[2:01:33] gifts almost to deceive the very elected
[2:01:36] looks like a wheat grain open it up
[2:01:39] there's no wheat there at all it's only
[2:01:41] shuck but back in there then they begin
[2:01:43] to form the Oneness organization the
[2:01:46] Trinity organization the Tunis
[2:01:48] organization and Church of God
[2:01:49] organization and all organized and just
[2:01:52] death exactly
[2:01:54] you can't run a church like a business
[2:01:57] doesn't work
[2:01:58] that that that voice
[2:02:01] behind the man the inspiration said you
[2:02:04] businessmen stay out of the pulpit
[2:02:10] God what does he say here
[2:02:14] Trinity organization a Tunis
[2:02:16] organization and Church of God
[2:02:17] organization and all organized and just
[2:02:20] death exactly and now what happens
[2:02:23] but it's a shelter for the wheat
[2:02:27] it's been growing through it all the
[2:02:29] time
[2:02:30] so brothers and sisters when we look at
[2:02:32] different Ministries different churches
[2:02:34] different
[2:02:36] around the message of the hour don't
[2:02:38] point fingers
[2:02:40] don't scoff at people
[2:02:42] maybe we don't see it the way they see
[2:02:44] it maybe they don't see it the way that
[2:02:45] we see it but you know what we all need
[2:02:47] each other because we're all a part of
[2:02:48] the plant and you know what the most
[2:02:50] important thing is I think that God
[2:02:52] showed me this just towards the end of
[2:02:54] last year's we talk about that life
[2:02:55] cycle and how there's the there's the
[2:02:57] seed and and then there's the stock and
[2:02:59] then there's the tassel and then there's
[2:03:01] the shock and then there's the wheat
[2:03:03] back in there the seed at the very top
[2:03:05] you know what brothers and sisters it's
[2:03:07] a great example but if we catch the
[2:03:09] vision behind that it's the life that's
[2:03:12] behind the name it's not the plant it's
[2:03:14] not the portion or the cycle of the
[2:03:16] plant it's the life that's in the plant
[2:03:18] and you know what the seed holds all of
[2:03:20] that but so does all the rest of those
[2:03:22] portions and we need each part of the
[2:03:26] body we can't say brother Branham says
[2:03:28] it I can't say I'm pinky I'm mad at you
[2:03:30] so I'm just going to cut you off or big
[2:03:32] tall you stink I want to get rid of you
[2:03:34] we can't do that we need each part of
[2:03:36] the body we're all part of it brother
[2:03:39] Branham says now it's begin to pull away
[2:03:40] the Wheats begin to be seen this is not
[2:03:43] a Pentecostal age this is the latter day
[2:03:46] age this is the bride age this is the
[2:03:49] evening light this is when Malachi 4
[2:03:51] must be fulfilled to follow God's
[2:03:54] pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be
[2:03:56] fulfilled this is the second dot dot dot
[2:04:00] what was he saying there this is the
[2:04:02] second dot dot dot and Jeremiah and all
[2:04:06] the rest of them that Joel has spoke of
[2:04:08] these days this is that day I have heard
[2:04:12] Lord and it was coming but now I see
[2:04:15] with my eye this is Brother Brad I'm
[2:04:18] speaking here now I have heard but now I
[2:04:20] see 1965.
[2:04:23] we okay this morning
[2:04:25] got another quote he says see a man can
[2:04:28] say anything
[2:04:30] but lest God interprets that word
[2:04:33] see now we have our own interpretation
[2:04:35] and we say it means this
[2:04:38] and this one Methodist says this Baptist
[2:04:40] says this Pentecostal says this Oneness
[2:04:43] says this tuna says this and oh my
[2:04:46] there you are
[2:04:47] but God don't need no interpreter
[2:04:50] he's his own interpreter
[2:04:53] he interprets his own word by
[2:04:55] vindicating it in the H that it's
[2:04:58] purpose for
[2:04:59] the age that it's given for
[2:05:02] so brothers and sisters if we get a
[2:05:04] revelation say God sent us a revelation
[2:05:07] take it back to the message of the hour
[2:05:11] and if it doesn't show up in the message
[2:05:12] of the hour take it back to the word of
[2:05:14] God and you know what if it doesn't show
[2:05:16] up in either one of those just leave it
[2:05:17] alone
[2:05:18] don't go out on the branch and say I'm
[2:05:20] going to fight to the death because I
[2:05:22] believe that God gave me a revelation
[2:05:23] you know what if it doesn't line up with
[2:05:25] the message of the hour it's not God's
[2:05:27] revelation
[2:05:28] I want to say it clearly it's a lying
[2:05:31] spirit
[2:05:33] just leave it alone
[2:05:37] remember that Satan comes to church
[2:05:39] Satan's religious Cain and Abel they
[2:05:41] both worshiped in the same church they
[2:05:43] were both taught the same message they
[2:05:46] both went to church they both went to
[2:05:48] Sunday school they both had the same
[2:05:49] parents they both were able to hear the
[2:05:52] voice of God
[2:05:54] both of them
[2:05:56] brother Branham says it very clearly the
[2:05:58] cane he was religious
[2:06:00] he was probably even more religious than
[2:06:03] Abel because he brought the beautiful
[2:06:05] spread the beauty of the land all the
[2:06:07] first fruits of the land what a
[2:06:10] beautiful display that would have been
[2:06:12] all the flowers and all the fruits
[2:06:14] everything laid out in its place a
[2:06:16] beautiful array of banquet table before
[2:06:18] the Lord what a tremendous thing but it
[2:06:21] wasn't what God wanted the Revelation
[2:06:23] was blood
[2:06:24] and we know that cable all he did was go
[2:06:27] and chop the neck of a of a helpless
[2:06:29] little innocent little lamb
[2:06:32] and his brother must have said screamed
[2:06:34] out and said you're crazy what are you
[2:06:36] doing that for that innocent lamb did
[2:06:38] nothing
[2:06:39] but it was a revelation
[2:06:41] and you know what he was an oddball in
[2:06:43] his day
[2:06:45] brother Adam says we're not living in a
[2:06:46] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[2:06:48] age
[2:06:50] see we're not living in the Methodist
[2:06:52] age we're living in another age
[2:06:54] we're living up on here to the bride age
[2:06:58] out of the calling out of the church and
[2:07:01] getting it together for the rapture
[2:07:03] that's the age where we're now living to
[2:07:07] my honest opinion that's exactly the
[2:07:09] truth
[2:07:11] this isn't something that brother
[2:07:13] Barry's just trying to spin it's just I
[2:07:15] believe a revelation that God showed me
[2:07:17] and then I went and looked it up and I'm
[2:07:19] saying wow this is beautiful
[2:07:22] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[2:07:24] that was that quote
[2:07:26] another quote now and with patience we
[2:07:29] have to wait for this for the prophecies
[2:07:31] that's promised every one of them must
[2:07:33] be fulfilled in its age for it for tells
[2:07:35] us the author has before done this and
[2:07:37] we wait to see him do it again what a
[2:07:40] time it is that we're living in
[2:07:41] something like a calendar you look at
[2:07:44] the calendar to find out what day of the
[2:07:45] year you're living in and you look at
[2:07:47] God's Bible to see what age we're living
[2:07:49] in we're not living in the Methodist
[2:07:50] stage at the Baptist age we're living in
[2:07:53] the bride Age The Calling bringing back
[2:07:56] to God through a channel that he
[2:07:59] promised to bring it back in he promised
[2:08:01] to do it but as it's been in every age
[2:08:04] people that man put their own
[2:08:06] interpretation to it by Theology and
[2:08:09] will not believe God's Divine
[2:08:12] Vindication of it
[2:08:14] what is God's Divine Vindication of it
[2:08:17] brothers and sisters he says that's
[2:08:19] God's interpretation not what I say what
[2:08:22] somebody else says but what God has
[2:08:24] promised and what God does proves that
[2:08:27] it's God's Own doing his own
[2:08:30] interpreting of his word modern events
[2:08:33] are made clear by prophecy the
[2:08:35] supernatural element brothers and
[2:08:36] sisters is not our ability to see the
[2:08:38] great signs and wonders to say that God
[2:08:40] sent a prophet and we can lay our hands
[2:08:42] on the sick and they shall recover and
[2:08:43] all these things that we can see with
[2:08:45] our senses it's not about that it's
[2:08:46] about being able to receive the word for
[2:08:48] our day when we can do that brothers and
[2:08:50] sisters we have got that super Church
[2:08:52] ability we've got that super raceness
[2:08:56] about us it's not about skin color it's
[2:08:59] about the Holy Spirit color it's about
[2:09:01] receiving the word for our day and
[2:09:03] getting that same one mind and one
[2:09:05] Accord attitude where we can see God
[2:09:07] move in our lives
[2:09:10] oh my
[2:09:15] didn't Jesus say in the last days
[2:09:17] Matthew 24 24 that there would be so
[2:09:19] close that it would deceive the very
[2:09:21] genes predestinated the elected ones
[2:09:25] if it was possible
[2:09:28] almost like the real thing see
[2:09:31] so in the last days now see it's weak
[2:09:34] time now it's getting Harvest Time this
[2:09:37] is not Luther's age this is not
[2:09:39] Pentecost age this is the bride age
[2:09:43] as Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[2:09:46] Christ today is calling a church out of
[2:09:48] a church you see the same thing in type
[2:09:51] taking them to the Glorious Eternal
[2:09:54] Promised Land
[2:10:00] he says now to refuse that person that's
[2:10:03] doing the calling
[2:10:05] many people would say well it's Brother
[2:10:06] Brad I'm doing the calling or or maybe
[2:10:08] it's brother Berry doing the calling or
[2:10:11] maybe it's another Minister somewhere
[2:10:12] doing the calling over the years here we
[2:10:14] have that that Covenant Angel speaking
[2:10:17] through the man he says now to refuse
[2:10:19] that person that's doing the calling
[2:10:20] Christ no matter if you're Pentecostal
[2:10:23] Methodist Luther whatever you are you've
[2:10:26] got to this age nothing against them not
[2:10:28] at all but this in this age now you've
[2:10:32] got to accept like they did in that age
[2:10:34] the person of Christ
[2:10:38] which is the word
[2:10:40] that's why brothers and sisters it goes
[2:10:42] right back to the very beginning we
[2:10:44] talked about it I no longer call you
[2:10:46] church I call you bride that you might
[2:10:48] understand it that you'll understand it
[2:10:50] that that will understand that when we
[2:10:52] receive the word we're not just
[2:10:55] receiving the word we're receiving
[2:10:57] Christ but when the devil can get in and
[2:11:00] raise up a scarecrow and say well now
[2:11:01] you're talking about some crazy things
[2:11:03] you know
[2:11:04] what really happened in the Garden of
[2:11:06] Eden that's a little bit nuts when we
[2:11:09] can say you know I don't really want a
[2:11:10] scream and shot I don't really want to
[2:11:12] worship I don't really believe that I
[2:11:14] need to go to church on Sundays and
[2:11:15] Wednesdays every time the doors are open
[2:11:17] I don't really have to have that desire
[2:11:19] to be there you know you don't
[2:11:22] but the bride does
[2:11:24] she's going to say I want to be there I
[2:11:27] want to follow the word of God for my
[2:11:29] day because we know that that's what it
[2:11:31] is it's not following a man it's not
[2:11:33] following an association it's not even
[2:11:35] following the message brothers and
[2:11:37] sisters we should take that word out for
[2:11:39] a little while take that word message
[2:11:41] out and just simply say Christ because
[2:11:43] he came in his word form he came down
[2:11:46] and opened the seals and revealed them
[2:11:48] to us and said just like I told my
[2:11:50] disciples I no longer call you servants
[2:11:52] I call you friends I no longer call you
[2:11:54] church I call your bride so that you'll
[2:11:57] understand this this is going somewhere
[2:11:59] and where this is going is back up to
[2:12:01] heaven you're going to come with me if
[2:12:03] you can receive this word but if you
[2:12:04] can't receive this word then you're
[2:12:06] probably going to be Earthbound we don't
[2:12:09] want to let anything hold us back we
[2:12:10] heard brother Branham say it invisible
[2:12:12] Union to the bread don't let anything
[2:12:13] hold you back brothers and sisters one
[2:12:15] day the fire is going to fall don't let
[2:12:16] any worldly thing hold us down don't let
[2:12:19] anybody talk you out of it nobody's
[2:12:21] Creeds or Traditions just get into
[2:12:23] Christ and see if he won't the person of
[2:12:26] Christ dissolve all the doubts about the
[2:12:28] message of the hour
[2:12:30] you know what in in this in this study
[2:12:33] that I was looking at here maybe I'll
[2:12:35] call the musicians we're we're going
[2:12:37] over time now I just feel like that you
[2:12:39] know
[2:12:40] when did Brother Brown mention this the
[2:12:42] last time he mentioned that it's the
[2:12:43] bride age where he talked about it being
[2:12:46] the person of Christ this word he talked
[2:12:49] about it in the message leadership
[2:12:51] and we know that leadership is the
[2:12:53] second last message
[2:12:55] to communion
[2:12:57] leadership is the last one that was
[2:12:59] preached and and communion was just sort
[2:13:01] of a Vindication that you know what I
[2:13:03] will discern the Lord's body before I go
[2:13:05] because we know he was called home after
[2:13:07] communion but you know brothers and
[2:13:08] sisters unless we're willing to be led
[2:13:10] we can't be led
[2:13:12] we're not going to be able to be led if
[2:13:14] it sounds crazy for me to say it that
[2:13:16] way but we've got to be willing to be
[2:13:18] led by the word to be able to have
[2:13:20] communion we're not going to be able to
[2:13:22] have communion if we can't accept Christ
[2:13:24] the word for our day
[2:13:28] I think it's just beautiful
[2:13:30] just beautiful I just want to encourage
[2:13:32] us when you press play
[2:13:33] and you hear that voice say good evening
[2:13:35] friends oh my goodness brothers and
[2:13:38] sisters go back to the Garden of
[2:13:40] Gethsemane where he was there with his
[2:13:42] disciples go back there with him and
[2:13:44] listen to him say that to his disciples
[2:13:46] I no longer call you servants but I call
[2:13:48] you bride
[2:13:50] so much more than they had even then you
[2:13:52] know what he said it good evening
[2:13:54] friends in the message of the hour 180
[2:13:57] times good evening friends
[2:14:00] I just think it's such an encouraging
[2:14:03] thought
[2:14:04] but who said it brothers and sisters my
[2:14:07] you know as we go forwards in 2023 I
[2:14:10] just want you to know my heart brothers
[2:14:11] and sisters I don't have a big list of
[2:14:13] goals that I want to set with the church
[2:14:15] and say we're going to do this and do
[2:14:17] that and maybe the other I don't want to
[2:14:19] do that the only thing I want to do is
[2:14:20] say that I want to encourage every one
[2:14:22] of us to recognize our position I want
[2:14:25] us to recognize what we are because when
[2:14:27] we recognize that then we'll get out of
[2:14:28] here and the only way we're going to get
[2:14:29] out of here is to preach this message of
[2:14:31] the hour Christ the word of God in our
[2:14:34] day at the absolute highest level when
[2:14:36] you're playing hockey you have got to
[2:14:38] skate to where that Puck's going to be
[2:14:40] you have got to shoot the puck to where
[2:14:41] that skater is going to be you don't
[2:14:43] shoot it to where you're at right now we
[2:14:45] don't want to talk about where we're at
[2:14:46] right now the children of Israel didn't
[2:14:48] want to dwell upon where they were at
[2:14:49] right then they wanted to talk about
[2:14:51] that promise that was given to them
[2:14:53] there was a promise of all that I'm
[2:14:54] flowing with milk and honey and today
[2:14:56] we've been given that promise the
[2:14:58] opportunity to move right into Christ
[2:15:00] that is our promised land today brothers
[2:15:02] and sisters so as we go forwards in 2023
[2:15:05] just so that you know my heart I want to
[2:15:07] see he has all come to the full
[2:15:09] recognition of the word of Jesus Christ
[2:15:11] and I know that I can't do it for anyone
[2:15:13] I can only do it for myself and the only
[2:15:15] way that's going to happen for this guy
[2:15:16] is a greater consecration I've been
[2:15:19] talking about it for a while but it's
[2:15:20] the same for every one of us if you want
[2:15:22] to be more consecrated brothers and
[2:15:24] sisters there is a call in your heart
[2:15:25] then you've got reason to Rejoice
[2:15:27] because God's still calling we have the
[2:15:29] ability to hear his voice just
[2:15:31] consecrate ourselves and he will do all
[2:15:34] the work the only thing that we need to
[2:15:35] do is just get ourselves out of the way
[2:15:37] maybe stand with me this afternoon
