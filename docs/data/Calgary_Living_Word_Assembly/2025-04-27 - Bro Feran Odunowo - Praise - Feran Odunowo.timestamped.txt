[0:00] And this is impromptu this morning, but
[0:02] I believe it to be a blessing. Brother
[0:03] Paul was asking if there was a special,
[0:05] and I thought, well, I have a reason to
[0:08] praise the Lord. So, I will bring this
[0:11] anyway it sounds, it's going to be a
[0:12] blessing.
[0:18] I'll praise in the
[0:21] valley, praise on the mountain.
[0:28] I'll praise when I'm
[0:31] sure. Praise when I'm
[0:33] [Music]
[0:36] doubting. I'll praise when
[0:40] outnumbered. I praise when
[0:43] [Music]
[0:45] surrounded. God's praise is the
[0:49] waters my enemy drowns in.
[0:56] As long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[0:59] reason to
[1:03] praise the Lord. Oh my
[1:08] soul. I got to
[1:13] praise the Lord. Oh my
[1:17] soul. I'll praise when I feel
[1:21] it. Praise when I don't.
[1:28] I praise God cuz I
[1:30] know you're still in
[1:36] control. My praise is the
[1:39] weapon. It's more than a sound. More
[1:43] than a
[1:45] sound. My praise is the shout that
[1:49] brings charcoal down.
[1:54] Oh, as long as I'm breathing, I've got a
[1:59] reason to
[2:03] praise the Lord. Oh my
[2:07] soul, I got to
[2:12] praise you,
[2:13] Lord. Oh my
[2:17] soul, I wouldn't be quiet. My God is
[2:21] alive.
[2:23] How could I keep it inside? I've got to
[2:30] pray Lord, oh my
[2:44] soul. Our praise cause you're so sorry.
[2:47] Praise cause you rain. Praise cause you
[2:51] rose. and defeated the grace. Our praise
[2:55] cause you're faithful. Praise cause
[2:57] you're true. Praise God cuz there's
[3:00] nobody greater than you.
[3:06] Praise the Lord. Oh my soul.
[3:11] I've got
[3:13] [Music]
[3:14] [Applause]
[3:19] them. I've got
[3:21] [Music]
[3:23] [Applause]
[3:27] them. I won't be quiet. No, I wouldn't
[3:31] be quiet. My God is alive. How could I
[3:36] keep it inside? I won't be quiet.
[3:41] My God is alive. How could I keep it? I
[3:46] won't be
[3:49] quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep
[3:54] it inside? I've got to
[4:00] praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[4:06] [Music]
[4:24] Heat. Heat.
