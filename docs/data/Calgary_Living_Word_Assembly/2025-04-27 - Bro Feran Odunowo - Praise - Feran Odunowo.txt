========================================

And this is impromptu this morning, but I believe it to be a blessing. Brother Paul was asking if there was a special, and I thought, well, I have a reason to praise the Lord. So, I will bring this anyway it sounds, it's going to be a blessing. I'll praise in the valley, praise on the mountain. I'll praise when I'm sure. Praise when I'm [Music] doubting. I'll praise when outnumbered. I praise when [Music] surrounded. God's praise is the waters my enemy drowns in. As long as I'm breathing, I've got a reason to praise the Lord. Oh my soul. I got to praise the Lord. Oh my soul. I'll praise when I feel it. Praise when I don't. I praise God cuz I know you're still in control. My praise is the weapon. It's more than a sound. More than a sound. My praise is the shout that brings charcoal down. Oh, as long as I'm breathing, I've got a reason to praise the Lord. Oh my soul, I got to praise you, Lord. Oh my soul, I wouldn't be quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep it inside? I've got to pray Lord, oh my soul. Our praise cause you're so sorry. Praise cause you rain. Praise cause you rose. and defeated the grace. Our praise cause you're faithful. Praise cause you're true. Praise God cuz there's nobody greater than you. Praise the Lord. Oh my soul. I've got [Music] [Applause] them. I've got [Music] [Applause] them. I won't be quiet. No, I wouldn't be quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep it inside? I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep it? I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How could I keep it inside? I've got to praise the Lord, oh my soul. [Music] Heat. Heat.
