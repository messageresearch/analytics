[51:01] 9 2 Corinthians chapter
[51:06] 5 and Hebrews chapter

[51:36] heavens let's just bow in prayer one
[51:38] more time gracious Lord Jesus we thank

[51:51] because we can read this scripture not
[51:53] just by Revelation but we can take it at
[51:55] face value Lord because we know that
[51:57] there is an Earthly Tabernacle there is
[52:00] an Earthly body there is an Earthly
[52:03] Temple father Lord that's not made by
[52:07] hands we we think about it in this world
[52:10] father and we love these lives that we
[52:12] have but father we know that one day one
[52:15] way or another we have to lay down these
[52:17] Earthly Tabernacles and father put on
[52:20] our Heavenly Tabernacles so father we
[52:23] just thank you for the promise that
[52:25] you've given us Lord and we just want to
[52:27] commit this service into your hands we
[52:29] pray that you would just bless the words
[52:30] that are spoken father that that it
[52:32] would just be an encouragement to us
[52:34] tonight that when we leave here we would
[52:36] just want to be that much closer to you

[52:47] seated just want to remind us of a few
[52:51] um calendar events we have brother James
[52:53] nanab Bandy coming here on uh October
[52:57] the 1st Sunday October the 1st he'll
[52:59] take the morning service he's uh busy
[53:02] making his rounds in Canada now and uh
[53:05] he's certainly Making Tracks
[53:07] crisscrossing western Canada and uh
[53:11] starting October the 4th which will be a
[53:14] Wednesday we will begin a study of the
[53:18] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[53:21] uh as I've mentioned if anybody needs a
[53:23] a book or would like one by all means
[53:24] let me know and a few folks have taken
[53:27] me up on that and uh certainly looking
[53:30] forward to seeing what the Lord will do
[53:32] with
[53:33] that and I uh do believe that this is
[53:37] Sister Rosie's last service with us I
[53:40] thought that Sunday was and uh we're
[53:43] blessed to see her again but I do
[53:45] believe she's going back tomorrow so
[53:46] just keep sister Rosie in your prayers
[53:49] and her family it's been a bit of a
[53:51] struggle for her but we know that all
[53:53] things work together for the good to
[53:56] those who are called according to his
[53:58] purpose and we know that sister Rosie
[54:01] has a strong testimony of this message
[54:03] of the hour so God bless you Sister
[54:05] Rosie we'll certainly keep you in our
[54:08] prayers just wanted to mention that uh
[54:10] we were able to secure a gym for October
[54:13] 31st so we'll have a gym night on
[54:15] October 31st for those people who can or
[54:18] want to attend and participate it will
[54:20] be just a time of getting together and
[54:23] doing something together as believers
[54:25] so we'll have a few Sports Maybe and
[54:28] Just a time to get together so there's
[54:30] no pressure If you can come if you want
[54:33] to come we want to try and create an
[54:36] atmosphere and opportunity for the
[54:37] children to have a place to go to on
[54:40] Halloween night it's a terrible night in
[54:44] this world and I certainly don't miss
[54:46] the uh scenery that we see in the city
[54:50] when we lived in the area that we were
[54:52] in in Okat coses it just seemed to get
[54:53] worse and worse every sing single year
[54:56] where the the residents in the areas
[54:58] wanted to turn their yards into a
[55:00] graveyard and have as
[55:03] much sickness that they could possibly
[55:06] display and it's just acceptable now but
[55:08] it's interesting isn't it because once
[55:10] upon a time it was Christmas and people
[55:13] put Christmas decorations out like that
[55:15] everywhere and now it's just a
[55:18] manifestation of Halloween but I think
[55:21] it's interesting because we can look at
[55:23] it from the I would say the lens of
[55:25] Believers the ones who maybe can see
[55:28] what's going on in this world and
[55:30] understand the deceit that's actually
[55:32] taking place and recognize that there's
[55:35] really not a whole lot different between
[55:36] the two and that that could be really
[55:39] difficult for some to say or to hear but
[55:42] it's true Christmas is not what the
[55:46] world has set it up to be not at all and
[55:48] we have a prophet that brought it out
[55:50] very clearly that Christmas is a Roman
[55:53] Holiday and and uh we're not going to
[55:55] get into that very far but I know that
[55:57] Christmas isn't blood and gore and and
[56:00] and graveyards and and don't get me
[56:01] wrong what I'm talking about is the
[56:03] spirit behind both events the spirit
[56:07] behind and the commercialism that this
[56:08] world has made both of them that spirit
[56:11] is the same spirit and uh it's just
[56:14] wonderful to be able to have that
[56:16] understanding of really where we stand
[56:19] tonight I want to talk about uh a new
[56:22] spirit I want to talk about a new spirit
[56:25] I uh part of a Bible study and we got
[56:27] into this last night and I just I found
[56:30] it so incredibly fascinating I'll
[56:32] probably be into this for a little while
[56:35] but I don't think I've ever heard
[56:36] brother Bram talk about it this way and
[56:39] uh it just captivated me so we just
[56:42] trust that it will be a blessing to you
[56:44] tonight and uh we'll see what the Lord
[56:46] will
[56:47] do um are you happy
[56:52] tonight I'd like to talk about the
[56:54] Tabernacle just to start with and uh you
[56:57] know out of Hebrews chapter 9 I
[56:59] mentioned that we would go into that I
[57:03] just didn't want to keep you standing
[57:04] and read a bunch of scripture read a lot
[57:06] of scripture um but if you have that uh
[57:10] slide brother Logan if you wouldn't mind
[57:12] just putting it up
[57:15] there we have the uh the Tabernacle in
[57:19] the wilderness this is the Tabernacle
[57:21] that the children of Israel were
[57:23] commanded to build and there was very
[57:26] specific instructions for
[57:27] it and uh I just wanted to take a little
[57:31] bit of time and and talk about that
[57:32] before we really get into it tonight so
[57:34] from Hebrews chapter 9 verse 1 then
[57:38] verily the first
[57:40] Covenant had also ordinances of divine
[57:44] service and a worldly
[57:47] Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle
[57:49] made the first wherein was the
[57:52] Candlestick and the table and the
[57:53] showbread which is called the sanctuary
[57:56] and that would be on that slide if we
[58:00] could bring it back up that would be the
[58:03] first room inside that
[58:07] Tabernacle and after the second Veil The
[58:10] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[58:13] of all and that would be the next room
[58:16] and that's where the Ark of the Covenant
[58:18] is the farthest left room that's the
[58:20] holy of
[58:21] holies verse four which had the gold
[58:25] sensor and the Ark of the Covenant
[58:27] overlaid round about with gold wherein
[58:31] was the golden pot that had mana and
[58:33] Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables
[58:37] of the
[58:38] Covenant and over it the cherubims of
[58:42] Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which
[58:46] we cannot now speak
[58:51] particularly
[58:53] sorry
[58:56] verse 6 now when these things were thus
[58:59] ordained the priests went always into
[59:01] the first
[59:02] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[59:05] God but into the second went the high
[59:08] priest alone once every year not without
[59:12] blood which he offered for himself and
[59:15] for The Heirs of
[59:18] people the Holy Ghost this signifying
[59:22] that the way into the holiest of of all
[59:25] was not yet made manifest while as the
[59:29] first Tabernacle was yet standing which
[59:33] was a figure for the time then present
[59:35] in which were offered both gifts and
[59:38] sacrifices that could not make him that
[59:41] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[59:44] the
[59:46] conscience which stood only in meats and
[59:49] drinks and diverse Washings and carnal
[59:51] ordinances imposed on them until the
[59:54] time of reformation but Christ being
[59:57] come and high priest of good things to
[1:00:01] come by a greater and more perfect
[1:00:03] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[1:00:06] to say not of this
[1:00:10] building I'm going to stop there and I
[1:00:13] just wanted to lay out just a little bit
[1:00:15] of a background about this what we're
[1:00:17] talking about is the Tabernacle but also
[1:00:21] a new
[1:00:23] spirit and the new Spirit how we all
[1:00:27] have to come to the place where we get a
[1:00:30] new spirit but I think it's a amazing
[1:00:33] thought I don't think I've ever heard
[1:00:34] brother bradam say it just because we
[1:00:36] get a new spirit it doesn't mean it's
[1:00:39] the holy
[1:00:41] spirit it's a very important thing to
[1:00:44] understand and myself I I I was just
[1:00:46] sort of like aha wow this this is this
[1:00:51] is something significant this is
[1:00:53] something that I need to I need to think
[1:00:55] about I need to talk about I just need
[1:00:57] to see what the Lord will do with it so
[1:00:59] bear with me tonight as we go um it's
[1:01:02] just a wonderful wonderful
[1:01:04] thing um out of John 2 ver1
[1:01:09] 17 and his disciples remembered that it
[1:01:12] was written I've got a lot of scriptures
[1:01:13] tonight so I'll probably just quickly
[1:01:15] read them and uh if you can bring them
[1:01:19] up that's great if you feel like turning
[1:01:21] maybe I should slow down John 2 verse1
[1:01:24] 17
[1:01:25] I guess I get a little nervous and his
[1:01:28] disciples remembered that it was written
[1:01:29] the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
[1:01:33] then answered the Jews and said unto him
[1:01:35] what sign showest thou unto us seeing
[1:01:38] that thou doest these
[1:01:40] things Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:01:43] destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will
[1:01:46] raise it
[1:01:48] up then said the Jews 46 years was this
[1:01:53] temple in building and wilt thou rear it
[1:01:55] up in 3
[1:01:56] days they were looking at it carnally
[1:02:00] and Jesus knew full well they were
[1:02:02] looking at it carnally that was the only
[1:02:05] way they had to look at it but he wasn't
[1:02:07] speaking carnally he was speaking
[1:02:10] spiritually but I think that he actually
[1:02:13] wanted them to look at it in a carnal
[1:02:15] way so that he could bring this out so
[1:02:18] that his disciples would understand it
[1:02:19] at a later time so that we would be able
[1:02:21] to read this scripture and understand it
[1:02:23] at a later date verse 21 says but he
[1:02:26] spake of the Temple of his
[1:02:29] body for the longest time I didn't even
[1:02:31] really understand that but the body
[1:02:35] that's not made with hands that's what
[1:02:36] we're talking about tonight I think it's
[1:02:38] so beautiful and you know that body not
[1:02:41] made with hands is created for a new
[1:02:43] spirit and it's not just for a new
[1:02:45] spirit to live there it's it's to change
[1:02:48] our spirit to a new spirit to get rid of
[1:02:51] the old man and change him into the new
[1:02:54] man
[1:02:54] and that is for a purpose brothers and
[1:02:56] sisters and that purpose this is kind of
[1:02:59] the the crescendo of it all is so that
[1:03:02] our spirit would be able to house his
[1:03:05] spirit because until we have a new
[1:03:07] spirit his Spirit doesn't even come in
[1:03:09] US it can't because he can't get along
[1:03:12] with our spirit he won't subject himself
[1:03:15] to our
[1:03:16] spirit that's why we have to guard
[1:03:18] ourselves as a temple as a tabernacle we
[1:03:23] talk about this building here being a
[1:03:25] temple and a tabernacle and we know that
[1:03:27] we heard brother bradam say it you know
[1:03:29] even a child running through the
[1:03:31] building can upset the holy spirit for
[1:03:34] the next
[1:03:36] meeting we reverence this
[1:03:39] building but do we reverence these
[1:03:43] buildings or do we watch whatever we
[1:03:45] watch and do whatever we do and and and
[1:03:49] go wherever we go and it's just okay we
[1:03:52] get influenced with whatever we get
[1:03:54] influenced with would we do that
[1:03:56] influence in here I just think if we
[1:03:59] wouldn't do it here how could we do it
[1:04:01] there and feel like it's
[1:04:03] okay because it's the same Spirit isn't
[1:04:06] it or is it I think it's beautiful it
[1:04:11] it's it's it's it's just it's just made
[1:04:13] it so clear to me out of out of the
[1:04:15] inner veil in 1956 brother bradam says
[1:04:18] God said in another place over in
[1:04:20] Ezekiel we'll we'll go and read that in
[1:04:22] a little bit he said I will
[1:04:24] in that day take out your old fleshy
[1:04:28] Stony heart and I'll give you a new
[1:04:31] spirit and I'll put my spirit in you
[1:04:36] sometimes I wonder whether I'm on the
[1:04:37] right track whether I should be going
[1:04:39] this way with a a service and is it is
[1:04:42] it what you want Lord am I just doing
[1:04:44] this on my own but then I I I I I try
[1:04:47] and put my thoughts together and Cobble
[1:04:49] it around and and and we come and we
[1:04:52] hear that
[1:04:53] song
[1:04:54] there's a fountain open in the House of
[1:04:59] David I I I just think it's amazing
[1:05:01] because it's just about exactly what we
[1:05:03] hear in Ezekiel right brother Ram goes
[1:05:05] on to say now a lot of people even you
[1:05:07] Pentecostal people a lot of times get
[1:05:10] mistaken in that you get a new
[1:05:13] spirit that's not God's
[1:05:19] spirit that one put me on the floor when
[1:05:21] I heard
[1:05:22] that that's you
[1:05:24] that isn't God says you get a little
[1:05:27] happy because you got a new spirit you
[1:05:29] jump up and down run around over the
[1:05:33] floor maybe and Shout a little bit now I
[1:05:37] don't know if anybody has ever done that
[1:05:39] maybe not but maybe had a real good
[1:05:41] feeling really felt like you connected
[1:05:44] with God and things are super good you
[1:05:46] leave the service and and and those
[1:05:48] temptations that you struggle with are
[1:05:51] twice as strong there's there's twice as
[1:05:54] much of the old you as there was when
[1:05:57] you were in that
[1:05:58] service I've encountered that many times
[1:06:01] and and I think my why is
[1:06:04] it I I can look at it and say you know
[1:06:06] it's because maybe he's still working on
[1:06:09] Me Maybe it's still just my spirit and
[1:06:12] maybe I just need to keep allowing
[1:06:14] myself to to have his Spirit manifest in
[1:06:17] my
[1:06:18] life but that's where I say brothers and
[1:06:21] sisters and we know this don't quit amen
[1:06:24] just keep pressing
[1:06:26] on there was one thing that brother
[1:06:28] brandham said they told him from the
[1:06:29] other side when he was over there beyond
[1:06:31] the curtain of time just keep pressing
[1:06:34] on just keep going to church go get
[1:06:37] Washed by the Water of the word don't
[1:06:39] stay
[1:06:40] home don't let anything turn you
[1:06:43] away that's the biggest trick of the
[1:06:45] devil is to get us separated from the
[1:06:48] body of
[1:06:49] Believers he can get us separated then
[1:06:52] he can really go to working on us us but
[1:06:55] when we come to church that spiritual
[1:06:57] Amnesia starts to wash away it starts to
[1:07:02] erode brother the brandom says maybe you
[1:07:05] get in the spirit and and jump up and
[1:07:07] down and run around over the floor maybe
[1:07:09] and Shout a little bit and speak with
[1:07:11] tongues even
[1:07:14] whoa how many of us speak with
[1:07:18] tongues manifest the the fruit of the
[1:07:20] spirit the gifts of the Spirit however
[1:07:24] we want to call it we know that brother
[1:07:26] bradam said it very clearly the initial
[1:07:28] evidence of the holy spirit is not
[1:07:29] speaking in tongues but here he he says
[1:07:32] it in this way that we could be speaking
[1:07:34] in tongues and running around and
[1:07:36] jumping up and down and and run around a
[1:07:38] little bit and think you got the Holy
[1:07:40] Ghost he says that's not it that's a new
[1:07:45] spirit God gave
[1:07:50] you he says that's not it that's a new
[1:07:52] spirit God gave you that's
[1:07:55] you this this made me take a double take
[1:07:58] on this then after he give you your
[1:08:01] spirit then he said I'll put my
[1:08:08] spirit that's what's the matter with the
[1:08:10] meal with the Mis meal cramps you got
[1:08:14] today and I think just looking at that I
[1:08:17] I think he's implying the people that
[1:08:20] fast and pray fast and pray fast and
[1:08:22] pray
[1:08:24] and and they still get nowhere with God
[1:08:26] he says that's what the matter what's
[1:08:28] the matter with the Mis meal cramps you
[1:08:30] got today that's right that's the reason
[1:08:32] you can't get nowhere with God he says
[1:08:34] notice you put a new spirit God has to
[1:08:38] give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[1:08:40] even get along with
[1:08:43] him it's a process brothers and
[1:08:46] sisters and I want to say thank you Lord
[1:08:49] because I know you're still working on
[1:08:50] me and that's why I this caught my
[1:08:53] attention ition it captivated me to
[1:08:55] think about it it it almost makes it a
[1:08:57] little bit tangible to see maybe the
[1:09:00] stages that we go through in our lives
[1:09:03] as human beings we're all fighting the
[1:09:05] same enemy we're not fighting one
[1:09:08] another we're fighting the same enemy
[1:09:10] and that is to be able to get to the
[1:09:12] place where we know that we've got his
[1:09:14] spirit because when we got his Spirit
[1:09:16] we're not going to labor the way that we
[1:09:18] used to with our own
[1:09:21] Spirit notice you put a a new spirit God
[1:09:25] has to give you a new spirit or you
[1:09:26] couldn't even get along with
[1:09:28] him you can't get along with
[1:09:31] yourself that Old Devil Spirit you had
[1:09:34] in you so he's got to put a new spirit
[1:09:38] in you so you can get along with his
[1:09:40] spirit
[1:09:43] amen I will put a new spirit in them and
[1:09:47] I will put my spirit in them he said
[1:09:51] after he's give you a new spirit
[1:09:54] that's
[1:09:55] you don't get it confused with God's
[1:09:58] spirit it's
[1:09:59] not it's your new
[1:10:02] spirit so you can get along with the
[1:10:04] Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you
[1:10:08] amen because you in your condition never
[1:10:11] get along you can't get along with your
[1:10:15] wife you can't get along with your
[1:10:18] husband can't get along with your
[1:10:21] neighbor how you ever going to get get
[1:10:23] along with
[1:10:26] God so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:10:29] before you can get along with
[1:10:33] him so he puts his puts a new spirit in
[1:10:37] you and then he puts his Spirit In You
[1:10:40] gives you a new spirit a new outlook a
[1:10:43] new Faith then he puts his holy spirit
[1:10:46] in
[1:10:48] you tonight brothers and
[1:10:51] sisters I definitely don't want any
[1:10:53] anybody to think that maybe you don't
[1:10:56] have the Holy
[1:10:57] Spirit by saying this what I'm saying is
[1:11:00] it's a process that we go through and
[1:11:02] sometimes we have got to go through some
[1:11:05] Muddy Waters we've got to Wade through
[1:11:07] the swamp and Satan's going to tell us
[1:11:10] that you've got the Holy Ghost when you
[1:11:11] don't when it's your spirit when it's
[1:11:14] your new spirit you've got to go further
[1:11:17] you can't stay
[1:11:20] there and Satan will come around and
[1:11:22] tell you that you don't got the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost when you
[1:11:25] do when you do have the Holy
[1:11:29] Ghost but just remember it's a struggle
[1:11:32] that we all go through everybody has to
[1:11:34] go this way nobody comes unto the father
[1:11:38] except through the son except through
[1:11:40] the Holy Ghost you know we can nobody
[1:11:43] can call Jesus Lord except for having
[1:11:46] the Holy Ghost in their
[1:11:48] lives so I would say that's the word of
[1:11:50] God I know that's the word of God you do
[1:11:52] too if you can say that Jesus is Lord of
[1:11:54] your life and maybe things that happen
[1:11:56] in your life you don't like you're not
[1:11:58] proud of you always want to fix and
[1:12:00] repent Paul said I Die daily if that's
[1:12:02] what's happening then that's the right
[1:12:04] thing you've got the Holy Ghost don't
[1:12:07] let Satan say you don't but for some
[1:12:09] people I think it might be important to
[1:12:11] talk about this because we can get
[1:12:14] confused brother bradam says it in
[1:12:15] another quote here as we get going he
[1:12:17] says it that we can think that we've got
[1:12:19] the Holy Ghost but we just have a new
[1:12:22] spirit he talks in the message the lamb
[1:12:25] and the Dove and it's not a quote I'm
[1:12:26] bringing up I'm just going to talk a
[1:12:28] little bit about it so don't worry
[1:12:29] brother but in the lamb and the dove
[1:12:31] brother bam he he talks about it what if
[1:12:33] you know the lamb is being led by a a
[1:12:36] dove that's what needs to happen the
[1:12:38] lamb is always led by the dove brother
[1:12:40] Bram talks about and and the lamb is is
[1:12:43] like Jesus Jesus Spirit the life of
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ Living out through his
[1:12:48] children we have his Spirit we are Lambs
[1:12:51] of God as well and we have to to be led
[1:12:54] by the dove which is represented by the
[1:12:56] Holy Ghost and and and represented as
[1:12:59] the dove that's what brother Bram talks
[1:13:00] about in that message but what if that
[1:13:03] lamb suddenly turns around and snorts
[1:13:05] like a wolf at the dove or just in
[1:13:09] general he says the dove is timid the
[1:13:12] dove is just going to pull back and just
[1:13:14] go and set in a tree and just wait until
[1:13:16] that nature changes in that lamb
[1:13:19] sometimes as humans we can snort like a
[1:13:22] wolf even though we're a
[1:13:24] lamb and Satan will turn around and say
[1:13:27] yeah you are a wolf look at you you're a
[1:13:30] dog you're barking like an animal you
[1:13:33] can't get along with your
[1:13:36] neighbor but the believer will go and
[1:13:38] make it
[1:13:42] right in Hidden life with Christ
[1:13:46] 1956 talking about this this topic here
[1:13:49] brother bradam says now the Bible said
[1:13:52] that he would give us a new heart
[1:13:55] and he would give us a new
[1:13:57] spirit and many people even Pentecostal
[1:14:00] people and Full Gospel people have been
[1:14:02] deceived in
[1:14:04] that many times God said I'll give you a
[1:14:08] new spirit that wasn't his
[1:14:11] Spirit that's your
[1:14:13] spirit then I will put my spirit in you
[1:14:18] I'll give you a new spirit then I will
[1:14:20] put my spirit in you
[1:14:23] many times you get the new spirit and
[1:14:27] think you've got the Holy
[1:14:28] Spirit and this is where I think it's
[1:14:30] critical for us to just look at in our
[1:14:32] lives brothers and sisters and and
[1:14:34] trusting upon emotions and signs and
[1:14:38] things when your life doesn't pvy up to
[1:14:41] that now that's just a little raw but
[1:14:44] remember it's the
[1:14:45] truth I I'll just pause there and say it
[1:14:48] this way we know that there's the stages
[1:14:51] there's justification there's
[1:14:52] sanctification there there's the baptism
[1:14:53] of the Holy Ghost sometimes we can get
[1:14:56] caught up in one of those places or
[1:14:58] maybe we're just a little bit imbalanced
[1:15:00] one way or the other sometimes we'll
[1:15:02] just get stuck in in sanctification and
[1:15:05] I know when I was more of a junior
[1:15:07] Christian I was stuck in sanctification
[1:15:09] myself for a while and and what happens
[1:15:11] when that happens is we start to look at
[1:15:13] other people and we say well if they
[1:15:15] were a Believer they wouldn't do that
[1:15:18] well who's to say that how do we know
[1:15:20] that who are we to say that about
[1:15:22] anybody
[1:15:24] it's not up to us to judge it's up to
[1:15:25] God to
[1:15:26] judge sometimes we're given the ability
[1:15:29] to see things so that we can pray about
[1:15:31] them so that we can really make a change
[1:15:34] because if we see something that needs a
[1:15:36] change there's only one way we're going
[1:15:37] to make a change and that's to actually
[1:15:39] pray about it not to go and actually
[1:15:42] bring it to someone and try and change
[1:15:44] it
[1:15:45] ourselves that's not going to happen but
[1:15:48] that's what happens sometimes when folks
[1:15:49] get stuck in justification they want to
[1:15:51] justify their actions all the time
[1:15:53] they've got a justification for it or or
[1:15:56] sanctification we're pretty holy
[1:15:58] everything that we do is in a in a
[1:16:00] really specific holy Manner and uh no
[1:16:04] that's not the way a Believer is brother
[1:16:06] bradam said it very clearly that true
[1:16:08] Revelation never Puffs us up we never
[1:16:12] get puffed up by Revelation what happens
[1:16:14] is we get more compassionate we get more
[1:16:17] tolerant we get more willing to pray and
[1:16:19] intercede for our brothers and our
[1:16:21] sisters because truly we are our
[1:16:24] Brother's Keeper we are our Sister's
[1:16:28] Keeper he says and trusting upon
[1:16:30] emotions and signs and things when your
[1:16:32] life doesn't piffy up to that now that's
[1:16:33] just a little raw but remember it's the
[1:16:35] truth many people that spirit that new
[1:16:38] spirit God had to give you a new spirit
[1:16:41] to get along with his
[1:16:43] Spirit Well some people so mean they
[1:16:47] can't even get along with
[1:16:50] themselves let alone with God if he'
[1:16:53] come in he says that's
[1:16:56] right sometimes we can be Our Own Worst
[1:16:58] Enemy brothers and sisters we can really
[1:17:01] be hard on ourselves just commit it to
[1:17:04] God just give it to the Lord take the
[1:17:07] time to die out to yourself and see if
[1:17:10] he won't come on the scene and change
[1:17:12] things he
[1:17:16] will he says that's right so doubtful
[1:17:19] and up and down God has to give you a
[1:17:22] new spirit
[1:17:24] give you a new
[1:17:26] nature so you can get along with his
[1:17:28] Spirit when it comes amen I hope you see
[1:17:32] it and I want to say it tonight brothers
[1:17:34] and sisters I hope you see it we can't
[1:17:37] feed on the aarion of this world and
[1:17:39] think that we're going to actually have
[1:17:41] his
[1:17:42] Spirit we might have a new spirit but if
[1:17:46] we're feeding on the things of this
[1:17:48] world in whatever capacity or Avenue it
[1:17:51] is we're not feeding the holy hly spirit
[1:17:54] because the Holy Spirit only feeds on
[1:17:55] one thing the word of God
[1:17:59] period And I would say the word of God
[1:18:02] and the message of the hour because
[1:18:03] they're one and the same now that might
[1:18:05] be Blasphemous to say it but we've
[1:18:07] talked about that in the
[1:18:09] past but you know there's only one thing
[1:18:12] that's going to feed that Spirit if we
[1:18:14] want that new spirit to be in our lives
[1:18:17] to accommodate the Holy Spirit then we
[1:18:19] have got to feed on what the Holy Spirit
[1:18:21] feeds on and that's all
[1:18:24] and I say Lord help me I don't need to
[1:18:25] look at news feeds what do they do for
[1:18:27] me they do nothing for me they're
[1:18:29] Negative they bring me
[1:18:32] down what do you feed
[1:18:35] on is it
[1:18:37] videos is it games is it
[1:18:41] music is it news
[1:18:43] feeds or is it the
[1:18:46] word when we get spare time in our lives
[1:18:49] what are we doing are we are we spending
[1:18:51] it with the Lord oh or we spend it on
[1:18:54] ourselves I would say if we're eager to
[1:18:57] just go and blow our time on
[1:18:59] ourselves then that means we're actually
[1:19:02] feeding a new spirit but maybe not the
[1:19:05] Holy
[1:19:08] Spirit and you know I I just want to say
[1:19:11] this brothers and sisters what I'm
[1:19:12] talking about tonight isn't to
[1:19:13] discourage anyone I want to try and
[1:19:15] encourage us because the more we feed on
[1:19:18] the word of God the more we see his life
[1:19:20] live out through us the more we feed on
[1:19:23] the word of God and see his life live
[1:19:24] out through us the more successful we're
[1:19:26] going to be in our relationships the
[1:19:28] more successful we're going to be in
[1:19:30] understanding the word of God the more
[1:19:31] successful we're going to be in our
[1:19:32] business we're going to get into it a
[1:19:34] little bit later in some of these
[1:19:35] scriptures here he will bless us beyond
[1:19:38] measure if we're willing to feed him in
[1:19:40] our
[1:19:41] lives but but if we want to come
[1:19:43] contrary to his word then we're just
[1:19:45] going to stay stuck in that new spirit
[1:19:47] realm a and we're going to have a new
[1:19:49] spirit we'll be blessed God will bless
[1:19:51] us but we'll still have that that wolf
[1:19:53] snarl will come out every now and again
[1:19:55] it will still be there but boy oh boy
[1:19:57] when he comes into our lives he will
[1:19:59] actually push all of that
[1:20:01] out then we'll start to get along with
[1:20:05] ourselves and maybe our neighbors he
[1:20:08] says amen I hope you see it God gives
[1:20:11] you a new spirit for yourself and then
[1:20:14] puts his holy spirit in there Amen to
[1:20:17] dwell with you and abide with
[1:20:21] you cuz that that Tabernacle if we could
[1:20:24] go back to
[1:20:25] that that Tabernacle was a
[1:20:28] representation of the scripture we read
[1:20:31] in in 2 Corinthians tonight that
[1:20:34] Tabernacle has the outer
[1:20:37] court it's got the outer fence that
[1:20:39] would be this flesh right and then we
[1:20:42] have the the inner Court which is that
[1:20:46] first room where the the all of the
[1:20:50] instruments of worship are for the high
[1:20:53] priest all all of that is in there
[1:20:55] that's that's going to be the inside
[1:20:57] that'll be our new spirit but then
[1:20:59] there's the other court on the left side
[1:21:01] where the Ark of the Covenant is where
[1:21:04] the the word of God is the holy place is
[1:21:08] what it's called in the Bible we call it
[1:21:09] the holy of holies many times but that
[1:21:11] place would be that teeny little spot
[1:21:13] brother bradam talked about in the heart
[1:21:15] of a man that God created for himself
[1:21:18] only in human beings for himself the
[1:21:21] place for him to exist to live that is
[1:21:24] an example of our lives our bodies and
[1:21:27] you know brothers and sisters remember
[1:21:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:21:32] forever the high priest went in once a
[1:21:35] year to do service unto the go unto God
[1:21:38] and and when he went in there he
[1:21:40] couldn't just go in there willy-nilly
[1:21:42] he could not just go in there just just
[1:21:46] just full of all the thoughts of this
[1:21:48] world he had to go in there prayed up
[1:21:50] and prepared he had to go in there ready
[1:21:53] for service of the Lord so much so every
[1:21:57] single thing that he did when he walked
[1:22:00] he had to walk the walk that said holy
[1:22:03] holy holy art thou oh Lord we know that
[1:22:06] he had pomegranates tied to his his robe
[1:22:09] there's many different things we get
[1:22:10] into but the thing about it is the the
[1:22:13] point that I want to get to is he had a
[1:22:14] rope tied to his ankle excuse me brother
[1:22:17] there was a rope tied to his ankle and
[1:22:19] that was for the reason if he wasn't
[1:22:21] properly prepared entering into the holy
[1:22:24] of holies once a year then they would
[1:22:26] drag him out by that rope tied to his
[1:22:28] ankle because he was not ready to meet
[1:22:31] the Lord something was insufficient in
[1:22:34] his walk with the Lord if he's the same
[1:22:38] yesterday today and forever brothers and
[1:22:40] sisters what are we doing where are we
[1:22:42] at tonight are we actually walking that
[1:22:45] kind of a walk before the Lord because
[1:22:48] the word of God says that we are Kings
[1:22:51] and Priests
[1:22:54] so we have a sacrifice to offer unto the
[1:22:57] Lord we have a responsibility to the
[1:23:00] Lord God Almighty the same one right
[1:23:04] there that we would look at that they
[1:23:06] would
[1:23:07] worship and we know that that that whole
[1:23:09] entire building was wrapped in Badger
[1:23:11] skins and Badger skin is a
[1:23:13] representation of the
[1:23:16] human a really resilient really tough
[1:23:19] really nasty little
[1:23:21] creature doesn't die
[1:23:23] easy but boy once it dies it sure makes
[1:23:26] a nice Temple hey there's a reason why
[1:23:30] God chose Badger
[1:23:32] skins you know uh new spirit the the the
[1:23:36] the quote new spirit is mentioned 62
[1:23:39] times in the message and brother
[1:23:41] brandham he says it early on in his in
[1:23:42] the message but then he he stops about
[1:23:45] it and I think it's a real interesting
[1:23:46] thing because I do believe there was a
[1:23:48] change in the ministration of his
[1:23:50] ministry and and and I think that
[1:23:52] perhaps it could have changed gears a
[1:23:55] little bit from the new spirit and I'm
[1:23:57] not going to say that this is the
[1:23:58] doctrine that you should hang your soul
[1:24:00] upon what I do want to do is just
[1:24:02] explore the thought of the new spirit I
[1:24:04] I think the idea of of understanding
[1:24:07] that we need a new spirit in our lives
[1:24:10] so that we will be able to get along
[1:24:12] with his spirit so that his spirit will
[1:24:14] be able to get along with our spirit to
[1:24:15] me it just for the first time in my life
[1:24:17] when I heard this I thought it makes
[1:24:18] just perfect
[1:24:21] sense he'll give us a new heart let's
[1:24:23] turn over to
[1:24:25] Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter
[1:24:42] 11 start reading at verse
[1:24:46] 14 my
[1:24:51] goodness
[1:24:53] Ezekiel
[1:24:56] 11:14 again the word of the Lord came
[1:24:58] unto me saying son of man thy Brethren
[1:25:02] even thy Brethren the men of thy Kindred
[1:25:06] and all the house of Israel holy are
[1:25:09] they unto whom the inhabitants of
[1:25:11] Jerusalem have said get you far from the
[1:25:14] Lord unto us is this land given in our
[1:25:17] possession therefore say thus saith the
[1:25:20] Lord God those key words although I have
[1:25:24] cast them far off among the Heathen and
[1:25:27] although I have scattered them among the
[1:25:29] countries yet will I be to them as a
[1:25:33] little sanctuary in the countries where
[1:25:36] they shall
[1:25:37] come I just couldn't help but think
[1:25:39] about all of the folks who have come
[1:25:41] here from many different countries all
[1:25:43] around the world wherever we find
[1:25:45] ourselves in the world he will be our
[1:25:49] Sanctuary this word is true
[1:25:53] verse 17 therefore say thus sayeth the
[1:25:55] Lord God I will even gather you from the
[1:25:58] people and assemble you out of the
[1:26:00] countries where ye have been scattered
[1:26:03] and I will give you the land of Israel
[1:26:07] and they and they shall take away all
[1:26:10] the detestable things thereof and all
[1:26:13] the Abominations thereof from then and I
[1:26:16] will give them one heart and I will put
[1:26:20] a new spirit within you you and I will
[1:26:23] take the Stony heart out of their flesh
[1:26:26] and give them an heart of Flesh that
[1:26:30] they may walk in my statutes and keep my
[1:26:33] ordinances and do them and they shall be
[1:26:36] my people and I will be their God I just
[1:26:40] can't help but think brothers and
[1:26:41] sisters that is just Rich that that
[1:26:45] scripture that he will do exactly what
[1:26:48] brother bradam was talking about he will
[1:26:50] take out that Stony heart that's in the
[1:26:53] heart of a human being that we're born
[1:26:55] with when we're born in sin shaped in
[1:26:57] iniquity we come into the world speaking
[1:26:59] lies that heart has to go but once that
[1:27:03] heart goes there's a new spirit that
[1:27:05] he'll place within us and you know I'll
[1:27:08] be honest with you I kind of almost
[1:27:10] thought that new spirit was the Holy
[1:27:12] Spirit and this is what captivated me
[1:27:14] I've been corrected by the prophet to
[1:27:16] say no no that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:27:18] that's a new spirit that God will give
[1:27:20] you and that's so that you'll be able to
[1:27:22] get along with his holy spirit when he
[1:27:25] comes maybe it's just obvious and
[1:27:27] everyone else knew that I don't know but
[1:27:29] for me I just I guess it's inspiring to
[1:27:32] think it's exactly in line with the
[1:27:34] scripture here not that I would think
[1:27:36] anything that brother bradam wouldn't
[1:27:37] would say wouldn't be in line with the
[1:27:38] scripture I know it would be or he
[1:27:40] wouldn't say it and if he did say it and
[1:27:42] said it wrong then he would correct it
[1:27:44] but I I'm just telling you honestly I've
[1:27:46] been inspired by this really
[1:27:49] inspired to think that you'll just give
[1:27:52] us a new spirit but that's not the holy
[1:27:55] spirit so we need to be careful that
[1:27:57] we're we're willing to keep walking on
[1:28:01] and personally I think you know when
[1:28:03] when we see people if you look up new
[1:28:06] spirit you'll see brother bradam talks
[1:28:07] about why are people so tossed about why
[1:28:10] do people have find it so difficult to
[1:28:13] walk the Christian walk there's a few
[1:28:15] different messages in there maybe not
[1:28:16] tossed about that could be wrong um I
[1:28:18] could look it up for you right now but
[1:28:20] if you look it up you'll see what I mean
[1:28:22] he talks about it on those lines Why is
[1:28:24] it so difficult for people to walk the
[1:28:26] Christian walk and I think it just
[1:28:27] summarized is real nice because he talks
[1:28:29] about the new spirit in that one message
[1:28:32] very specifically and if we just get
[1:28:34] stuck thinking that we've got the Holy
[1:28:36] Spirit when we just have a new spirit to
[1:28:38] get along with the Holy Spirit when it
[1:28:40] comes what happens is Satan knows that
[1:28:43] and he'll come around and he'll throw as
[1:28:44] many banana peels and traps in our way
[1:28:46] as he can and we'll be up today and down
[1:28:49] tomorrow and up tomorrow and down the
[1:28:51] next day and up and down and up and down
[1:28:54] and we'll live this Christian Life and
[1:28:55] we'll wonder why can't we ever get the
[1:28:58] victory but if we could take a step
[1:29:00] wordss back and say what do we feed our
[1:29:03] lives on what are we feeding on if we
[1:29:06] can recognize the diet that we try and
[1:29:09] live on we'll be able to change
[1:29:11] ourselves we'll be able to take that
[1:29:14] next step and stop being stuck in
[1:29:17] sanctification stop being stuck in the
[1:29:19] position where we just have a new spirit
[1:29:22] and get on with things and get the holy
[1:29:25] spirit because without the Holy Spirit
[1:29:27] we're going to stay here on this Earth
[1:29:28] we're going to miss the general
[1:29:30] resurrection and
[1:29:31] Rapture that's why we harp on it it's
[1:29:34] that important it's important it's
[1:29:37] important for our lives it's important
[1:29:39] for our our families it's important for
[1:29:41] our children it's important for our
[1:29:44] church it it is the only thing to talk
[1:29:46] about just like Noah had only one thing
[1:29:49] to talk about it's going to rain and
[1:29:51] people said no it's going to be sunny
[1:29:53] you know I can look up the weather app I
[1:29:55] I can see it's going to be sunny
[1:29:56] tomorrow and the next day and I can
[1:29:58] click 14 days out and I can see look
[1:30:01] it's good you know and and back then
[1:30:03] they might have had even more technology
[1:30:05] and they'll just click six months out
[1:30:07] and say you know we can see it's not
[1:30:08] going to rain forecast is sunshine what
[1:30:11] are you talking about your crazy crank
[1:30:15] right that's what we're talking about
[1:30:16] the same thing people say it we we are
[1:30:19] crazy and we know it the way in which
[1:30:21] you call heresy that's how we worship
[1:30:24] that's what we believe we say the word
[1:30:27] that the prophet said some people would
[1:30:28] say oh you parot the prophet amen
[1:30:32] there's nothing else to say that's yay
[1:30:34] and amen that's the word of God thus
[1:30:36] saith the Lord God Almighty that's what
[1:30:40] that
[1:30:41] is but I just think tonight brothers and
[1:30:43] sisters don't get stuck with just a new
[1:30:45] spirit he'll give you a new spirit but
[1:30:47] we got to go on to that next stage we
[1:30:49] got to go on to the Holy Spirit the
[1:30:51] baptism of of the Holy Spirit and and
[1:30:53] and don't don't don't be discouraged by
[1:30:56] what I'm saying tonight I just want to
[1:30:57] make sure that we can just shake Our
[1:30:59] Lives take inventory and make sure that
[1:31:01] we know that we know that we know if
[1:31:03] Satan's coming around and giving us
[1:31:05] troubles then uh maybe we're just in
[1:31:07] that one spot and and and we just need
[1:31:09] to go a little further you know that God
[1:31:11] will allow that to happen in our lives
[1:31:13] he'll allow troubles to come our way not
[1:31:16] to crush us not to destroy us but to
[1:31:18] push
[1:31:19] us but the one thing that he won't do is
[1:31:22] push us all the way he'll get us to the
[1:31:25] position where we will be able to have
[1:31:28] the conscious decision in our lives
[1:31:30] where we decide to go forwards or we
[1:31:32] decide to step back and if we decide to
[1:31:35] step back that's where we start to
[1:31:36] shrivel up and die but boy when we step
[1:31:39] forwards brothers and sisters many times
[1:31:41] people will say look at that fanatic oh
[1:31:43] my shouting and service why is he
[1:31:46] worshiping like that what's wrong with
[1:31:48] the guy why can't I I I remember the
[1:31:50] first time I came to church brother
[1:31:51] boner was here and he kept saying amen
[1:31:55] amen and I was like come on guy I can't
[1:31:57] even hear the preacher what are you
[1:32:00] doing but then something happened to me
[1:32:03] somewhere along the way and I started
[1:32:04] saying amen and people probably thought
[1:32:07] what's wrong with that
[1:32:09] guy something
[1:32:12] happens you can't help it when it's the
[1:32:14] word of God something inside of you says
[1:32:17] amen just like when you recognize oh we
[1:32:20] have the opportunity to worship God I
[1:32:23] can actually express my voice I can
[1:32:26] close my eyes I can forget about
[1:32:28] everyone around me and I can just have
[1:32:31] that visualization of what it's like in
[1:32:33] heaven right now this moment right now
[1:32:36] and and that God can hear my voice and
[1:32:38] how he's probably saying hold on a
[1:32:39] second hold on a second there's a group
[1:32:41] of people down in Calgary Alberta and
[1:32:43] they're worshiping have you heard them
[1:32:45] worship listen to them
[1:32:47] worship probably doing that in
[1:32:50] heaven I don't want to come to a worship
[1:32:53] service and just be like I'm so glad
[1:32:57] that I can
[1:33:00] say one of
[1:33:02] who really if that's how you sing it who
[1:33:05] are you what Spirit have you got but
[1:33:07] when you can say hey I'm so glad that I
[1:33:10] can say I'm one of them redeemed people
[1:33:12] that he knew from before the foundation
[1:33:14] of the world that would be here in
[1:33:15] Calgary Alberta Canada to say Amen to
[1:33:18] the word of God my Hallelujah a new
[1:33:22] spirit he'll place a new spirit within
[1:33:25] you and then he'll give you a new heart
[1:33:27] and I can't help but think brothers and
[1:33:29] sisters that new heart isn't your heart
[1:33:31] it ain't my heart it's not the heart of
[1:33:33] a church it's the oh my it's the very
[1:33:36] Heart Of God it is the Holy Ghost
[1:33:38] himself coming and living taking up his
[1:33:41] abod in that Tabernacle not made with
[1:33:43] hands
[1:33:44] my cast away from you all your
[1:33:49] transgressions whereby ye have trans
[1:33:51] transgressed and make you a new heart
[1:33:54] and a new
[1:33:56] spirit for why will you die oh House of
[1:33:59] Israel for I have no pleasure in death
[1:34:02] of him that dieth saith the Lord God
[1:34:04] wherefore turn
[1:34:07] yourselves and live
[1:34:09] ye that is the Lord God speaking my
[1:34:13] goodness that's Ezekiel 18:31 and 32
[1:34:16] Ezekiel 3622 and 29 we're running out of
[1:34:20] time here so I'm just going to Boogie he
[1:34:21] says therefore say unto the house of
[1:34:23] Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not
[1:34:26] this for your sakes this is where it
[1:34:29] gets heavy this is where it turns into
[1:34:31] election I do not this for your sakes I
[1:34:34] do not this for your sakes oh House of
[1:34:36] Israel but for mine holy name's sake
[1:34:40] which ye have profaned among the Heathen
[1:34:42] with ye went and I will sanctify my
[1:34:45] great name which was profaned among the
[1:34:48] Heathen which ye have profaned in the
[1:34:50] midst of them and the Heathen shall know
[1:34:53] that I am the Lord saith the Lord God
[1:34:56] when I shall be Sanctified in you before
[1:34:59] their
[1:35:01] eyes not going to destroy us he's going
[1:35:04] to show the world himself how is he
[1:35:07] going to show the world himself it's not
[1:35:09] going to be a 60-foot Jesus floating
[1:35:11] down through the clouds it's going to be
[1:35:13] in you he's going to sanctify himself in
[1:35:17] you for I will take you from among the
[1:35:20] Heathen and gather you out of the
[1:35:21] countries and will bring you into your
[1:35:24] own
[1:35:25] land that's the Holy Ghost the promised
[1:35:28] land brothers and sisters that I will
[1:35:30] sprinkle clean water on you and you
[1:35:32] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[1:35:35] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[1:35:38] you a new heart also will I give you and
[1:35:43] put within you and I will take away the
[1:35:45] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:35:47] give you a heart of Flesh and I will put
[1:35:50] my spirit within you and cause you to
[1:35:53] walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my
[1:35:56] judgments and do
[1:35:58] them I just can't help but think
[1:36:00] brothers and sisters when Satan comes
[1:36:02] around read him this
[1:36:04] scripture read him this scripture and
[1:36:07] tell them you fell oh my and many times
[1:36:12] I feel like I fell but look at what he's
[1:36:14] going to do in me he's going to do this
[1:36:17] in me that's his word and you know Satan
[1:36:20] knows his word he knows his word and ye
[1:36:23] shall dwell in the land that I gave to
[1:36:26] your fathers and ye shall be my people
[1:36:28] and I will be your
[1:36:31] God he's doing it all Oh my Jesus Paid
[1:36:35] It
[1:36:37] All I will also save you from your
[1:36:43] uncleanness oh my I will call for the
[1:36:46] corn and will increase it and lay no
[1:36:50] famine unto you
[1:36:52] he's going to do it all brothers and
[1:36:54] sisters if we can just push aside all of
[1:36:56] the cares of this life all of the
[1:36:58] filthiness all the profane all the idols
[1:37:01] anything that we would put before the
[1:37:02] Lord just push it aside brothers and
[1:37:04] sisters give him the preeminence give
[1:37:06] him a little bit more don't try and do
[1:37:08] anything too traumatic but just take
[1:37:11] another step towards him is all I'm
[1:37:13] trying to say tonight just give him a
[1:37:15] little bit more and see if he won't
[1:37:17] increase your borders and and he'll do
[1:37:19] it all he said he'll give you increase
[1:37:21] the corn he'll give you money he'll give
[1:37:23] you houses he'll do all of that but what
[1:37:25] about the spiritual walk when the time
[1:37:27] comes to be able to come and worship the
[1:37:29] lord god
[1:37:32] wow the infallible word of God
[1:37:36] 1956 he says just like I've always said
[1:37:38] about love there's two different kinds
[1:37:41] of
[1:37:42] Love do you believe
[1:37:44] that some people gets them mixed
[1:37:48] up like some people being borned of the
[1:37:51] Holy Spirit they get mixed up in that
[1:37:54] new spirit that Jeremiah said that God
[1:37:57] said in the last days I'll write my
[1:38:00] spirit upon their hearts I'll write my
[1:38:03] law in their
[1:38:06] hearts brothers and sisters what will
[1:38:08] happen if and when a day comes and the
[1:38:12] Bride of Jesus Christ is still here and
[1:38:14] they take away all our
[1:38:15] Bibles they take away all of our
[1:38:19] devices they take away all of our
[1:38:22] ability to to listen and and and to
[1:38:26] read is that word going to be
[1:38:29] gone they can't touch it that's why we
[1:38:33] have this freedom to absorb this word to
[1:38:36] feed on this word I'm preaching to
[1:38:37] myself just as hard and as much tonight
[1:38:40] brothers and sisters we can take this
[1:38:42] word and eat it up and it will be in our
[1:38:45] bellies we will become this word we will
[1:38:48] not just read this word and and look at
[1:38:50] it but we will be this word I will write
[1:38:54] my law in their hearts and will give
[1:38:56] them a new spirit and then he said I'll
[1:38:59] give them my spirit and many people get
[1:39:02] the new spirit well you have to get will
[1:39:06] you have to have the new spirit you
[1:39:08] can't get along with your neighbor let
[1:39:10] alone with God see so you have to have a
[1:39:14] new spirit before you can get along with
[1:39:16] the Holy
[1:39:17] Spirit sometimes when you get the new
[1:39:19] spirit you think then that you've got
[1:39:21] the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's the
[1:39:24] new spirit the holy spirit will witness
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ but if you just joined
[1:39:30] Church went up and knew that you should
[1:39:32] do right that's just a new spirit and
[1:39:36] I'll say it tonight brothers and sisters
[1:39:38] if we say that we just join church and
[1:39:41] just believe that God sent a prophet but
[1:39:43] we don't go and do what that Prophet
[1:39:46] said we might just have a new spirit
[1:39:49] that's all because anybody can say God
[1:39:52] sent a prophet that's good that's real
[1:39:55] good it's wonderful because he did but
[1:39:58] can we do what that Prophet said that is
[1:40:01] where the rubber meets the road that's
[1:40:02] the brass tax and you know what to be
[1:40:05] just a little bit off a little teeny bit
[1:40:08] off of what that word from the prophet
[1:40:11] said is going to be terrible at its
[1:40:15] destination and it's so tragic because
[1:40:17] we can look at it here in this day and
[1:40:19] age in which we live in and see the
[1:40:22] results of it where people have done
[1:40:24] that with their children they have been
[1:40:26] just a little bit off with this message
[1:40:28] of the hour it's okay you don't have to
[1:40:30] go to church on Wednesdays you don't
[1:40:32] have to go to communion you you you know
[1:40:35] we we can listen to tapes and and just
[1:40:37] be as strong can you will those children
[1:40:39] stand when that day comes for them to
[1:40:41] make their
[1:40:43] decisions we can see the fruits of
[1:40:49] it he says that's just a new
[1:40:51] Spirit a spirit God gave you and it's
[1:40:55] wonderful isn't it because he doesn't
[1:40:57] say the devil gave you and your church
[1:40:59] gave you God gave
[1:41:01] it but there's more that God wants to
[1:41:04] give you isn't it beautiful to think
[1:41:07] that he gives it to us we just need to
[1:41:09] keep walking and not give up just keep
[1:41:12] going and wait for the rest of
[1:41:15] it that's a spirit God gave you but not
[1:41:18] his spirit yet see you've come into
[1:41:21] Christ by the Holy Spirit baptism 1
[1:41:23] Corinthians 13 says by one Spirit we're
[1:41:25] all baptized into one body spiritual
[1:41:28] baptism into the body of Christ then
[1:41:30] you're SEC secured with Christ he
[1:41:32] doesn't amputate any arms legs or eyes
[1:41:36] or anything of his body he's
[1:41:39] perfect I just think that's beautiful
[1:41:42] that'd be another fridge quote right
[1:41:43] there he doesn't amputate any part of
[1:41:45] his body he keeps it he he just loves it
[1:41:48] all he loves every single part of his
[1:41:50] body doesn't he
[1:41:51] the little toe to the the the hair and
[1:41:53] the nose he loves the whole body every
[1:41:55] single part of the body is necessary
[1:41:58] brothers and
[1:42:01] sisters 2 Corinthians
[1:42:03] 3 we still got four
[1:42:06] minutes I'll call the musicians
[1:42:09] though just so I
[1:42:11] don't overreach I know it's Wednesday
[1:42:14] and we're
[1:42:16] weary 2 Corinthians 3 ver vers one do we
[1:42:22] begin begin again to commend ourselves
[1:42:24] or need we as some others Epistles of
[1:42:28] commendation to you or letters of
[1:42:30] commodation from
[1:42:32] you ye are our Epistles our epistle
[1:42:37] written in our hearts known and read of
[1:42:39] all men for as much as ye are manifestly
[1:42:43] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[1:42:46] ministered by US Written not with ink
[1:42:50] but by the spirit Spirit of the Living
[1:42:51] God not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[1:42:55] tables of the
[1:42:58] heart and such
[1:43:00] trust have we through Christ to God word
[1:43:05] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:43:07] to think anything of as of ourselves but
[1:43:11] our sufficiency is of God who also hath
[1:43:14] made us able Ministers of the New
[1:43:16] Testament not of the
[1:43:18] letter but of the spirit
[1:43:21] for the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[1:43:25] life that's where I want to say brothers
[1:43:28] and
[1:43:29] sisters if we're wondering where we're
[1:43:31] at
[1:43:32] tonight do we have a new
[1:43:35] spirit do we have the Holy Spirit Christ
[1:43:39] himself that that new heart that he
[1:43:41] would give
[1:43:43] us how are we living are we living by
[1:43:46] the
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:48] letter are we legalists
[1:43:52] or are we living by the spirit trusting
[1:43:55] in the Lord trusting in his
[1:43:59] word I believe that is the
[1:44:01] differentiating
[1:44:03] factor Jesus never got upset except for
[1:44:06] those people who were the most Pious
[1:44:08] religious individuals the ones that he
[1:44:11] said they were of their father the devil
[1:44:14] the most religious people of the day
[1:44:17] those are the only ones that he got
[1:44:18] upset with isn't that right everyone
[1:44:21] else the Sinners the ones that all of
[1:44:23] the most religious people were getting
[1:44:25] upset
[1:44:26] with those are the ones that he had
[1:44:28] compassion
[1:44:30] for so where are we at tonight how are
[1:44:34] we living our
[1:44:35] lives do we just have a new spirit or do
[1:44:38] we have a holy
[1:44:41] spirit my I just want to read that
[1:44:45] scripture that we just read there's
[1:44:46] still 2 minutes out of the Amplified
[1:44:49] Bible verse one says says are we
[1:44:51] starting to commend ourselves again or
[1:44:53] or we do not like some false teachers
[1:44:56] need written credentials or letters of
[1:44:59] recommendation to you or from you do we
[1:45:02] no you yourselves are our letter of
[1:45:07] recommendation our credentials written
[1:45:10] in your hearts to be known perceived
[1:45:13] recognized and read by
[1:45:16] everybody whether we know it or not we
[1:45:19] are written Epistles read of all men we
[1:45:22] don't really even have to talk and
[1:45:24] people
[1:45:25] know verse three says you show and make
[1:45:28] obvious that you are a letter from
[1:45:30] Christ delivered by us not written with
[1:45:32] ink but by the spirit of the Living God
[1:45:35] not on tables of stone but on tables of
[1:45:37] human
[1:45:38] hearts such is the Reliance and
[1:45:41] confidence that we have through Christ
[1:45:43] toward and with reference to God not
[1:45:47] that we are fit qualified sufficient
[1:45:49] inability
[1:45:51] of ourselves to form personal judgments
[1:45:53] or to claim or count anything as coming
[1:45:56] from us but our power and ability and
[1:46:00] sufficiency are from God it is he who
[1:46:05] has qualified US making us to be fit and
[1:46:09] worthy and sufficient as ministers and
[1:46:11] dispensers of a New
[1:46:14] Covenant of Salvation through
[1:46:18] Christ not Ministers of the letter
[1:46:22] of a legally written
[1:46:25] code but of the
[1:46:27] spirit for the code of the law kills but
[1:46:30] the holy spirit makes alive maybe stand
[1:46:33] with me tonight as we
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:41] close we're looking for something
[1:46:43] brothers and sisters and I just want to
[1:46:45] close with this scripture here tonight
[1:46:47] we're looking for a body fitly joined
[1:46:49] together out of a Ephesians
[1:46:51] 4:14 that we henceforth be no more
[1:46:53] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:46:56] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:46:58] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:47:00] whereby they lie in wait to deceive if
[1:47:03] we've got any other
[1:47:05] motive than getting the Holy Ghost in
[1:47:08] our lives and encouraging other people
[1:47:09] to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then
[1:47:12] I believe that verse that we just read
[1:47:13] speaks to who we are and where we're at
[1:47:16] any other motive than getting the Holy
[1:47:18] Ghost In Our Day verse 15 says but
[1:47:21] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:47:24] into him in all things which is the head
[1:47:27] even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:47:30] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:47:32] that which every joint supplieth
[1:47:35] according to the effectual working in
[1:47:37] the measure of every part maketh
[1:47:40] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:47:43] of
[1:47:44] itself in
[1:47:46] love in
[1:47:49] love
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] Philippians
[1:47:55] 4 and the peace of God which pass this
[1:47:58] passeth all understanding shall keep
[1:48:00] your hearts and Minds through Christ

[1:48:35] Peace shall be with
[1:48:38] you don't get caught up in carnal
[1:48:40] thinking about all these other things
