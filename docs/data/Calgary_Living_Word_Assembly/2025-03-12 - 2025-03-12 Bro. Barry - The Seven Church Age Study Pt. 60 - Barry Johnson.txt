Calgary with uh with our family our family naturally and our family spiritually certainly good to see brother Logan God bless you brother and congratulations first time I've seen your face since I saw the [Applause] post brother celiz good to see you here God bless you brother amen and each one in our midst tonight if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful that we can call you our Lord amen we know that there's only one way that we can do that and that's by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Hallelujah and father I just I can't shake the feeling I can't shake the the idea Lord the passion that there's nothing more important than the holy holy ghost in our life yes we could have great ministry we could have the greatest teachers humanly known on Earth but nobody could teach us like you could and father we just pray that tonight Lord we would not be just performing a religious ritual Lord Jesus that we would just be bringing a half-baked Christian experience to you father in a form of worship Lord but that we would strip ourselves down Lord that we would dress ourselves down by Your Word Lord and come according to your word father and allow us to be changed father from glory to glory not holding on to traditional thinking and ideas Lord Jesus but realizing there's only one way that we will see the Rapture that we will see a body change and that's to first see a character change oh Lord Jesus I pray that you would even start with me let me have a character change Lord I don't like the man that I see oh but father I'm so thankful that you don't see me the way that I do father I know that's every one of our experience Lord Jesus and tonight one more time I believe we could all say we just throw ourselves upon that rock of Revelation tonight Lord Jesus thank you Lord oh father let us fall upon you tonight Lord that you would not fall Upon Us father we pray that you would just meet each need made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand father we just ask that you would have the full preeminence in our service Lord and every thought Lord Jesus and every idea Lord every word that's spoken Lord Jesus let us not have our own but let us have yours father let that teacher come from the inside and minister to us one more time thank you Lord oh Father Like no man ever can we just Commit This service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians I certainly uh feel naturally uh playing a tape would be maybe a better thing to do but uh spiritually I just feel energized after our journey God bless you brother certainly appreciated the time in Philippines it was truly blessed but uh we're back home and let's get into the word if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to continue on with our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages the closing out of the Leo Dean Church age which is exactly where we are in the call it the sands of time the closing out of the leoan church age and we know that there is a leoan church age and there is a bride age and they actually overlap there's not a hard stop and a hard start they overlap but you know the leoan Church age is what will take people right into the tribulation the leoan church age isn't what delivers the church from the tribulation and we're seeing the ending of the leodan church age so where do we stand tonight I think this is so incredible in Revelations 3 verse4 and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither hot nor cold I would thou W hot or cold cold or hot sorry so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with iav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Chas be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for the ear to hear amen Lord Jesus we know that it's not just to hear and then just to take with the grain of salt it's so that we can be rebuked and we can be chastened that when you knock on the door that we would hear it and truly open the door to our heart to you father and say search us and try us that we might be like you father tonight we just ask that you would bless the word that's spoken that's read already father your Eternal Word we just commit each life each Soul each word that's spoken into your hands now for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we are certainly glad to be back we arrived last night um about I think it was about 10 o00 we got into Calgary and uh got home about 11:30 and we hit the ground running today so it's been wonderful wonderful to be back and we're thankful for the leadership of the Lord I I love what uh brother said to me earlier today I said you know I'm I just I'm so glad that I'm not an evangelist I don't want to travel that's not my heart's desire and I know some people are probably saying yeah you're a liar because you traveled but that's not the case I'm not actually uh Desiring to go and buy plane tickets and fly but with the leader ship of the Lord when he calls you have to go that's all I can say and uh I so appreciate the brother saying to me tonight don't say no don't say never just trust the Lord because he could call again I don't know but uh we had a wonderful time we had uh the opportunity to meet many many people um there was over 200 pastors at the Asian ministers conference and uh they were from India Pakistan Indonesia Vietnam Laos Cambodia Philippines USA and Canada there was a lot of ministers there and uh it was just so wonderful to meet them and to hear what the Lord is doing in their countries and through their Ministries and you know the the bride is coming to Perfection and and I just have this resounding thought in my heart you know what is that mean to come to Perfection the bride coming to Perfection is moving from bride to wife there's that intimate relationship there it's no longer just up to the marriage ceremony because we know the marriage ceremony the prophet said very clearly is happening right now on Earth we're not going to go to heaven for the marriage ceremony we're going to go to heaven to the Millennium for the marriage supper of the lamb and we know that comes after the marriage after your now husband and wife so it's just a wonderful thing to recognize the day in which we live there's a strong push uh a brother posted it about the Third Temple to be built in Israel we know that Israel's hearts are stirred very greatly it is not just something that's out there in the future it's currently happening right now and one of these days seriously there's going to be two witnesses that pop up on the news feeds and they're going to be doing Supernatural things on earth and those two witnesses are what will actually usher in Jesus Christ himself to make himself known to his Brethren and we know when that happens the bride is not on Earth she's already in the palace isn't that wonderful talking about our uh our ministers meeting there in in in uh Manila it was hot it was 39° and the Lord was good to us though we uh we learned a lot and uh I know I have a lot of encouragement uh just from the discussions that I had and some of the things that I heard some of the things that I heard and saw weren't really uh that exciting to understand and learn but you know that's not going to deter me from who I am and what I believe and the one thing that I I noticed was uh even in North America in the USA and maybe even in Canada and and probably all over in other countries I'm only going to talk about here in our backyard you know there's people with pet doctrines and they just love them and they just won't let go of them and the only thing they want to do is try and find quotes to support their pet doctrines and they want to quote and quote and quote my quote says your quote says what are we doing what are we doing I said this you know what if we've got a pet Doctrine I've got pet doctrines and and my pet doctrines are this message of the hour and I'm not interested in trying to make excuses for my pet doctrines because the word says the bride has thus sayith the Lord and has the mind of Christ to know what to do with it so if I'm going to take a pet Doctrine I'm going to start taking those and saying they're mine though that's my quote right there I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that there's a a hierarchy and there's a a low hierarchy and and it should be this way and I feel like it's that maybe you do it here and we do it there whatever the message is the message it was preached in English and we need to take it in English and we need to accept it the way that God's given it to to us John didn't have the opportunity to say I don't like the way that you've actually given me that book that was in the hand of him that sat on the throne could you please change it and adopt it to fit my lifestyle and what my pet doctrines are he said no take the book and eat it up it will be sweet in your mouth it'll sound so good when we say the quotes oh but once they get down inside it's going to change you from the inside your body's going to hate it it's the same for everyone and we've got to be willing to accept it that way that's probably my biggest takeaway from it is you know what just take the word just take the word put the word first it's the only thing that God will vindicate we can say that we have this or that or the other but there's only one thing he's going to back up and that's the word so I I'm thrilled that we have been studying this book here and and you know I'm I'm just going to preach from it I think probably until we have a body change this book is so rich I I'm going back over it again from the beginning and it's just my goodness there's so much that I missed so much that I didn't get it's beautiful okay we had uh four days I believe with the uh with the uh Asians ministers conference the AMC and it was just a wonderful time to get to know some brothers and one of the outcomes is I got to meet a brother Roshan from India and uh he's from India yeah yeah I wasn't sure I started to get confused before service he's from India and uh he's coming to Canada his son is actually fellowshipping in the Lower Mainland currently I believe he's going to school there and so he'll be here in July we're just working out the dates he's coming through Edmonton and then he's going to travel here and then I think he's going to Vancouver the Lower Mainland to visit his son so we're certainly excited to see him and uh it was neat to just make the connection but we've made some connections with other folks there and yeah it was just wonderful and you know one of the more notable connections that we made was with uh brother Eduardo evasco I didn't realize it as we were going but uh is uh sister Emily here tonight and Carman Citta they didn't make it tonight sometimes they don't on Wednesdays but they uh sister Emily shook my hand the last service we were here and she said are you going to see my brother when you're there and I said I don't know I I have no idea but they were able to work it out and uh you know the night before we flew back they were able to arrange a Monday night service at this church and uh so it was it was tremendous and I had said this you know it was just it just really struck me before service you know here we are uh a Monday night and and some might say well you're in Philippines and maybe there's nothing to do there but I can tell you if there's a place that's busy where people are busy they're up at the crack of dawn or even before and and they're going all day long until it's dark again and it's just uh you have to get up and go if you're going to do anything there from what I can gather and uh the people you know they're living their life the same as we are here and uh no doubt they're tired they went to school they went to work they have all their labors and chores and everything they're doing just like the rest of the humans on Earth and Monday night we had a service that just blew the lid off the place it was something else I don't know if we have a link to that service I wouldn't mind watching it again but uh yeah it was just it was really really good and I said you know on a Wednesday night you can see who the church really is Sundays there's a lot of people that come to church but Wednesdays are the people that come all the time and uh it's just something different about a Wednesday night service than on a Sunday and uh I had to say to them uh let alone a Monday here we are on Monday and the church was absolutely packed it was just wonderful humbling in fact you know so sister Emily's brother is the pastor there brother Eduardo iasco and that's sister Carmen C's son and I just felt so humbled they wanted to have a fellowship with food before service and I said you know I just don't eat before service I can't I need the blood to go up here not here I'll need a chair if you feed me before service so she actually texted her son and said you know if it's going to be after service then you need to order some Panet for brother Barry he loves Panet so he did and and I just just felt so touched sister Carmen sitt from Canada ordered this food for me while I was there and uh so afterwards I made sure I had my fill it was really good we had a wonderful time there and uh you know that that that assembly I think is over 50 years old attending and uh it's a very special place in the heart of the panetas as well I believe uh that's where both brother mvin and sister Fay under that Ministry got baptized sister Fay at that assembly and and brother mvin in Qatar is that right through the same pastor and uh that Ministry has uh is what grounded rooted in grounded the panetas in this message so a very uh near and dear Ministry that we were able to go and minister to so just wonderful to see it unfortunately that Pastor actually passed away in 2018 as well and so uh sister Emily's brother was voted in I guess shortly after that so sister carmena if you're listening tonight thank you so much for the Panet really enjoyed it and uh God richly bless you all are you happy tonight carrying on in our study I'll maybe have a little bit more to talk about on on Sunday about it I just wanted to give a little brief update for what we did there uh carrying on from where we left off in paragraph 1 173 brother brandham he says no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation and no and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more wow yet in verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne we find the True Vine true Spirit true church people exalted to the very Throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group what a tremendous statement that is the words of John the Baptist who so accurately set forth the Christ in relationship to the true and false church now comes to pass I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire interesting scripture that is isn't it remember I believe we talked about this a little while ago if there's no chaff there's no wheat I think it's important for us to remember we don't want to throw off on the chaff the chaff is the chaff but it's not up to us to burn the chaff and sometimes that lukewarm formal religious spirit likes to talk about burning up the cha it's just the chaff just a Shu just those guys no no there would be no wheat if there weren't those guys we need to make sure we remember that Christ the Great Harvester is now reaping the fruit of the earth he gathers the wheat into the Garner by coming for his own and receiving them forever unto himself then he returns to destroy the Wicked with fire unquenchable The Mystery of the tears and wheat of Matthew 13 is now also fulfilled another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and SED tears among the wheat and went his way anybody ever grow a garden here could you imagine planting your seeds and your rose getting it all ready together and finding out that someone came and planted seeds that you can't see in the night when you you just went to bed all the work that you did that'd be a little frustrating wouldn't it but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then had it tears and he said unto them an enemy hath done this so if you have weeds in your garden remember that it's an enemy the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn remember earlier in the church a book brother bradam talks about that what's going to gather them it's going to be Angels the Reapers but it might not be as we suppose I think it's so beautiful the way that brother brandham brings this as another Revelation what it's going to be is Angel Messengers each Church age are going to be gathering The Tears by the preaching of the word it's not going to be the great Roundup in the sky where they come after all the doggies like Cowboys with ropes to try and rope them and gather them all up and gather them and tie them and throw them in for the burning what it's going to be is an ecumenical move that's inside the church already a political movement whereby people believe they're right but they're not willing to take all the word and apply it in their life and because of that it's going to take them and bind them together did you ever notice birds of a feather they flock together sometimes you'll see spiritual affiliations within churches or different Church groups and certain people will tend to gravitate towards one another usually what it is is pet doctrines and I want to say this when we have a pet doctrine that doesn't line up with the word that is the Antichrist spirit amen it's either the Holy Spirit or it's the Antichrist spirit it's one or the other there's no lukewarm there's no gray area there's no mixing it it's a hybrid condition one word off is what caused the of mankind to doubt one word of the word of God is death today tonight in the age in which we live it's going to be just rejecting one word of the truth and saying I'm just going to do it my way I've done it this way all along and I'm just going to continue doing it this way nothing you can teach me or tell me it's going to carry on everything's good in my life right that's the Leo Dean Spirit I'm rich I got the money I'm increased with Goods we've got the port folio and I'm in need of nothing spiritually I've got this do you do we I think we need to check oursel sometimes sitting on an airplane for that long I guess you think too much but it's really shook me down and made me think where do we stand are we going to Forfeit our right to the marriage supper of the lamb for one word why not both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I'll say to the Reapers Gather ye together the first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them the ones that just actually just don't take all the word they say that's okay I'm just going to do it this way it's the way it's the way and it's the preaching of the word that does the separation brothers and sisters those are the Reapers the church age Messengers and the ones that stay true to the church age Messengers are the ones who are the wheat the ones that don't stay true to the church age Messengers they're the tears and the word does a separating no human does it the Angels aren't coming riding on horses like I said as a rodeo it's just the word it's a word thing and it's interesting because when we read a scripture like this many people would say well there's going to be a great time where that happens sure enough there will be a great white Throne judgment where he will separate the goats from the sheep that is that the white thrown judgment that's not on Earth while the wheat and the tears are are growing together carrying on he says the wheat n tears which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested what NAA set out to accomplish has finally come to pass what has Nia set out to accomplish a political system in the church in every single Church age a political system that will never ever be able to be rooted out from the church age that's the tear that was forced to grow alongs side the wheat it's a political movement what causes the church to become lukewarm formal and Powerless politics this is the way I think we should do it this is the way I think we should do it the church age book the holy ghost through the prophet messenger said very clearly the only church the only true church is the one that's led by the Holy Ghost all else is false if it becomes the hierarchy of Men We believe that we should do it this way then the pastor is no longer LED he's actually there getting paycheck as a job because now the leadership of the church which isn't the Holy Ghost over the pastor is running the church now you have a lukewarm formal and Powerless church that's what it is politics in the church from the very beginning right up to the very end the wheat and the tears from the first age until now have grown side by side and are harvested what Nia set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organ organization the false Church turns away any vestage of Truth and with political might reinforces herself with State backing and sets out to eradicate Forever The True Believer you know don't look at the Catholic church for this look at the message of the hour there's people that have come out of the message of the hour that are beating War drums against the message of the hour just wait now until this actually reaches the right ear the right political level and they will shut down anyone that says anything in the name of William Mary and Branham it will happen according to the the prophetic utterance but that's where the state backing will come in he goes on to say but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the Garner in the moment in a twinkling of and I all that we have ever dreamed about or preached about hey will happen no longer will the wheat and tears grow side by side no longer will the tears receive the blessing of God because of the presence of the wheat and that's what's happening now the tears are receiving the blessing of God because of the presence of the wheat you ever think about that that's such a powerful statement it doesn't make anybody anybody the only one is the the True Vine only true vine is the one that's with the word amen the whole word and nothing but the word amen no man-made ideas Creeds or dogmas only the word of God no longer will the weed and tears grow side by side no longer will the tears receive of the blessing of God because of the presence of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out in the six seal which will end in utter destruction of the wicked now I said a moment ago that the false find came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where en lodged all the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature and her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ it's not the prophet I think this is so rich it's Christ and and how does that happen there's only one way that happens right it's only by one Spirit we're baptized right and that's his Spirit excuse me I apologize I don't know I think the difference in temperature really got me my but we're certainly thankful for his healing touch I'm feeling much better than I was now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirit Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein Lodge the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature and her ress shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come up against this True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did you know when we were there we just had some tremendous services and one of them I I spoke on was the king's sword and another one was sheath and uh there's just I I just think such an amazing amount of power at our fingertips and if we just speak the word God will back it up but the only way that will happen is for us to be in the word and for the word to be in us all the way a church affiliation some sort of political standing ain't going to do it tenure ain't going to do it that ain't enough we have got to know Jesus Christ we have to be pregnated by Jesus Christ there has to be a Life coming forth inside of us that's Jesus Christ and all else is false but when we're there the True Vine with with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did just speak squirrels into existence you need some money you think God can't provide it you need a job you think God can't provide it right you need healing in your body don't think he can't provide it he can provide it and he will we won't but he will will through us cuz remember in the pick up your pen and write it says in there that there was things that he didn't complete while he was here in his Earthly Ministry that he now does in and through his bride then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come and that bride and groom May may be forever United as one I think it's so beautiful just to understand that you know he could easily just put any one of us away just say away with you you've cut your hair I know you've cut your hair I know that you had some secret sin before we got married I could easily just put you away and find a better one right but he doesn't does he he actually made one atonement for every single one of us how how could any one of us think that we could just put away a bride is beyond me especially in and around this message of the hour it just it boggles my mind but here we are paragraph 179 already the visible manifestations of what I have been telling you are seen all around us The ecumenical move of the tears is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet for the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power it has to be the restoration of the word what crucial times are these in which we live and how how how how crucial has it ever been except for the day in which we live we know this was in 1965 this book was released how crucial is the time today my how careful we must be that we remain True to this word and not take from it or add to it for he who would speak where God has not spoken makes him a liar and we know that it says in the Book of Revelation I believe it's in 21 that if we add to or take from it the plagues of this book will be added to us a and the right to the tree of life will be taken from us just the same crucial times that we live in what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God sending forth manifestation in tongues interpretation and prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word Drew up a Doctrine the tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues were far from the evidence they were manifestation but not evidence remember brother bradam says this in this church age book and I'm sure this Ruffles a lot of feathers but he says the evidence of tongues certainly are evidence of manifestation but what those tongues are isn't a a declaration of the word coming of the Lord what they are declaring is the sign of Destruction just like the Feast of Bel shazar the hand writing is on the wall with the manifestation of tongues especially when you see as we talked about before it went away there all this glossolalia where someone will be just talking and then suddenly religiously burst out into some foreign tongue and then back in Phase back into a a normal tongue it's unknown tongues there's no interpretation it's confusion it's out of order according to the word of God tongues is a manifest ation but not evidence the falsity of the doctrine cannot only be seen by a lack of scripture to substantiate it which is vital our lives have to have scripture to substantiate Our Lives we can pull quotes and say well I got this quote that justifies me to do this and I got that quote that justifies me to do that but have you got a scripture does the scripture back up your theory if it doesn't then you better leave it alone the falsity of the doctrine can only be seen by a lack of scripture to substantiate but those who subscribed to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of Doctrine proving that they were not in the truth as they would have people believe our lives speak volumes oh it looked good it looked like like the return of Pentecost but it proved it wasn't it could not be for it organized that is death not life when we see politics it's death not life politics do not run the Church of the Living God the Holy Ghost runs the Church of the Living God the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's it anything else is the Antichrist spirit that will creep into the church and cause it to become lukewarm formal and Powerless but we could have manifestation that's not the sign that's not what we're into oh it looked good it looked like the return of Pentecost but it proved it wasn't it could not be for it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were deceived and how many people run to the churches and say well look at how many activities they've got look at how many people go there look at how good they worship look at all this stuff the prophetic utterance said in 1965 in Satan's Eden there will be millions and billions of impersonators of Christianity thinking they're worshiping God but they're actually worshiping Satan they'll have awesome tremendous anointed songs and tremendous anointed musicians playing Perfection but it won't even be worshiping God you know the word of God says to make a Joyful Noise We need to make very sure we know where we stand when we worship we're bringing a sacrifice of praise and that sacrifice of praise is not our Perfection when we try to make it our Perfection we're getting political what we need to do is make it his Perfection and let his Spirit work through us and work and operate that gift inside of our life if we're trying to do it it's political we need to be careful and not be deceived now if it wasn't genuine what was it it was the husk the shaff in the green soft sheath form it looked like it was the real thing it has the appearance of it but as one can go into the field and see what looks exactly like wheat and yet it's only the husk for the wheat seed has not yet formed so this was but the soft shell that looked like the real grain Yet to Come the original wheat seed of Pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been buried at NAA it sent up a Chute at Sardis it grew a tassle at Philadelphia and it was mature at Le oysa but it could not be back to the original until the word was restored and isn't it beautiful to think there was a time where the word was restored at the end of the prophetic utterance of the seven Church age messenger at the end of his ministry he was preaching prepare ye way of the Lord he was preaching the second coming word coming of the Lord the manifestation of it get ready because he's coming as John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming so your ministry will be sent to forerun the second coming of the Lord that was his commission but there came a point in time where he had to say Behold the Lamb of God I'm not even worthy to do his shoes but he's standing here right now and that's happened that's history isn't it beautiful to think about that to realize that so where is he now oh my it's beautiful the original wheat seed at Pentecost was to come back in this last age it had been buried at Nia sent up a shoot at Sardis grew a tassel at Philadelphia it was mature at leoda but could not be back to the original until the word was restored the prophet had not yet come upon the scene but now according to the end time to the time when wherein we stand in the leodan age the prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7 must already be in the land it's beautiful he doesn't name himself he just says he must already be in the Land once more thus saith the Lord must be here ready to be manifested with infallible Vindication thus the true seed already maturing and then the Harvest it's so beautiful when you can read this and you can see it when you understand the message of the hour you understand the messenger to the age we understand the exposition of the seven Church ages we understand how God moves how he changes not that he is the same yesterday today and forever when we can see sort of the whole picture and take a step backwards to recognize that this is actually what's happening she has thus sayith the Lord if he is in her and she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with it so many people are trying to make this happen trying to Manifest this and it's not going to work Harvest time period yes Harvest Time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated and it's beautiful because what does the separating we talked about a little earlier it's not going to be a government p push brother Bram says it in the message it's not going to be a government push I think it's in uh recognizing your day in this message brother brandham says it very clearly that it's not going to be a government push that puts the church in the Rapture it's going to be the word of God that puts the church in the Rapture don't think that a squeeze is going to come along and squeeze us out of that shuck and cause us to jump up to heaven that's not what's going to happen the changing of our characters is what's going to put into the Rapture he is the same yesterday today and forever when did he come on the scene he was 30 years after the promise for the children of Israel and in in Egypt and when did he come in he came in when they started to cry when they were sighing and crying and he said hey I hear the cries of my children oh my I remember my promise to them what did he do he sent them a deliverer we know that's coming in the day in which we live Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated by the preaching of the word the true word the fruits of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Garners the two spirits will go to their separate destinations can you imagine what it's going to be like to go to the separate destination with no Antichrist spirit with no temptation with no problems no heartaches no sorrow no nothing a brand new world a brand new life a brand new existence a brand new thought plane like brother banam talked about the hog nature would you ever want to be at Banks Woods would you ever want a squirrel hunt in heaven would you want to go back to being a hog on Earth or would you want to actually go to the level of being a human being would we want to go from being a human being born in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies in the Hog Pen stay there or go on into True Perfection my goodness that's the day in which we live the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now is the time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat Bride come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat receive not her tears plagues the Great Tribulation of the six seal and Matthew 24 my I had a little bit of a a panic there I thought maybe we're getting a little bit late we still got lots of time all right the last warning of the spirit Revelations 3:22 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly now we can look at this and say that's a city that's been made and indeed I would say it has been and we'll walk there one day but I just want to say this brothers and sisters what if we were actually to take and and stop looking at that that description from the idea that it's going to be a a manufactured city that was built it was it was fabricated all of the best ingredients were sourced from all of the Universe all of creation the best that God could could possibly create for us from his spoken word all of those materials are implemented into this city you know when the Mormons build a temple I had the the luxury I'll call it of going through the Mormon Temple when they opened it in Northwest Calgary we had a painter who was a Mormon and a part of that assembly and he invited me and they tried to coax me over to their side and I I thanked him graciously for the milk and cookies and said I got to go but to see what they did in there was just it's astounding what they do in their temples their stuff is not locally sourced it's sourced from all over the world all over the globe and I think it's as as much money as they can spend is what they try and do they have a baptismal tank that's literally two stories tall manufactured to look like the the washing tub in the temple in Israel it's literally out carved out of one stone two stories tall it's crazy how magnificent it is that's that's the Earthly thing that's the probably the greatest description I could talk about the Vatican we' probably many of us have been there so many different things that we've seen naturally here we have God talking about this description through his Prophet but what I want to get to brothers and sisters is what if we could actually step back and say that's nice to talk about a city but what if he's actually describing his bride let's read this again and look at it from that perspective because we know that John was asked do you want to see the bride the Lamb's wife and he said oh sure and him being turned what did he see a city coming down from God out of heaven so let's read this here I think it's interesting this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have already been laid the street streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised in hinge like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her right watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly when you look at yourself in the mirror when I look at myself in the mirror this is coming to me fresh right now let's look at ourselves in the mirror with his description words with his adjectives this is how he sees us this is what's going on in heaven while they wait for us to realize who we are but boy once we do there will be no word that will get in the way remember the prophet said it don't let anything get between you and that word don't let any man don't let any church don't let any political movement don't let nothing get between you and that word I just think is beautiful the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly and so our theophanies wait for us brothers and sisters they're just waiting for us every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus love she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabit inhabitant and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over so for someone to come along and have this call it a pet Doctrine an eighth messenger you know call call me the guy I'm the guru you should you should maybe baptize in my name and maybe he won't say that but the people will start to because of the anointing that he has they'll believe he's so good they'll just want to fall in a shadow they want to touch him they want him to touch their babies Etc all of that all in the guise of the message of the hour it happens it's real there's no eth messenger there's no other person the word has already been perfected it's already been given entirely she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak at another age the ages are over I just can't help to think about what it will be like to actually jump out of this this Earthly robe of Flesh right this Earthly Tabernacle when it will be dissolved there's already another one waiting for us right what will it be like to have no restrictions in that body because we won't have to to worry about any restrictions there won't be any sin there won't be any Temptation we'll just be able to live as free as we were ever created like a bird in a cage that has all the strength that it ever needs one day that that lid will be just lifted off and that bird can fly to its heart's content to explore the way it was designed to that's where we're at that's where we're going the ages are over my goodness but thank God at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only to the in the spiritual ears of men by his Spirit but once again a prophet is in the Land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the leoan age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the Ben beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry amen and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that Bride of the last day who is mentioned in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at NAA has come back to the original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say period period I think that's so good the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing so when we hear someone saying something different and I'm I'm going to say this brothers and sisters it's one thing to say it but I believe this with all my heart we're not just talking about what we're saying we're talking about what we're living talk is cheap I can get up here and preach a storm up and not live this life and what good is that we have got to be living what we're preaching what he says from God the bride will say and live this isn't the Bible so I'm going to add to it I'm not going to take away from it but I'm going to throw words in there and live we'll be living what the spirit says we'll be living what the prophet says we won't be living another life the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying and living the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word it's not a new revelation Paul said it if an angel from heaven comes and says anything else to you than that which we have already said said let him be accursed this was the first church AE messenger remember he was the one setting the pattern in order for all the other ages again say I unto thee if an angel messenger says anything else than what we've already preached to you forget about it and get back to the word and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be ye separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we don't know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches you know what I'm going to do tonight I'm going to call the musicians and I'm going to actually close a little bit early tonight I'm just going to we'll pick up the resume of the ages as we go I uh yeah I'm just going to do that I just feel led to do that we're going to do that we'll close here on this paragraph 188 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches the spirit has spoken the Setting Sun is about to fade into Eternity for the the church ages then it will be all over then it will be too late to come you know I have this sentence High highlighted in here and and I think it's so important because it's beautiful what he says here if somewhere in this series God has dealt with you by his Spirit may you even now turn to him in Repentance and give your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you etal etal life and you know some might say brother Barry what are you saying here I've got eternal life maybe we do but maybe sometimes the tears that grow up around us can get us all tangled up and we just get into a position where we just don't know where we stand we can we can actually get those tears snipped off of us and we can actually come back to the word and we can have a refilling of his spirit and I believe that's what he's saying here if somewhere in the series God has dealt with you by his Spirit may you even now turn to him in Repentance and give your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you eternal life this this is not the age to to just simply have a new birth this is the age to actually give way to a new birth the life of Jesus Christ inside of us not to just dwell upon milk continually dwelling upon milk no this is the time to actually Feast on the the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ to eat his flesh and to drink his blood that we have life in us that's the age in which we live in and I know we all know this maybe stand with me as we close but if somewhere in this series God has dealt with you by his Spirit just just raise your cup unto him and say thank you Lord and if you need something else from him just ask him amen he's more than able more than willing to give it to us what a wonderful God we serve may you even now turn to him in Repentance and give your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you eternal life let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're just so thankful that we can gather together in Your Name Lord we don't know how many more times we'll be able to do this and many times it can sound like a Wednesday night cliche to say that but we live in an age where we've experienced it Lord where the government pressure has changed our ability to worship you in spirit and in truth it's changed our ability to gather together in your name and we know one of these days it's going to happen again and it'll be forever but we know that Lord there will be nothing that will ever stop your spirit from worshiping through your bride so Lord tonight I just want to commit each life into your hands For Your Glory I pray that as we read these words Lord as we eat the book father that it would change us from glory to glory that it would change us from the inside that there would be things in this book that that speak to our hearts Lord that speak to our very Souls Lord Jesus that cause us to want more of you and less of us father I pray that Lord if there's anybody here that needs more of you tonight that you would just grant it to them Father if anybody here doesn't know you in the full power of your Resurrection I pray that you would Grant it to them tonight father amen Lord Jesus that we would not be groping in darkness that we would know you in the fullest manifestation of your power for the age in which we live Lord we know you sent a prophet ET to call out a bride Lord so that she wouldn't actually stay as a bride that she would come on to the marriage supper of the Lamb that she would be willing to be so consecrated that she could be called your wife that she herself would make herself ready that she would recognize the position that you have called her to help us Lord Jesus to recognize the position that you have called The Bride of this last age too father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands now we pray that you would be glorified with a song or two Lord as we close the service just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Lord I Give You My Heart Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I live for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm awake Lord have
