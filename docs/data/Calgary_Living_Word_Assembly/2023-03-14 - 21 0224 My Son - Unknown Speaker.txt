want to get into the word so if we could turn over to uh the book of First John and then we'll turn over to our scripture in Isaiah chapter 43. just before we get into the word we have a couple of announcements remember the men's meeting tomorrow night at 7 pm we'll send out the credentials for the zoo meeting and uh the Brethren can get together and we'll discuss the church matters any orders of business that need to happen remember brother Phil has graciously accepted to take the service here on Sunday keep our brother in prayer trust the Lord will give him a fresh call off the altar to meet our needs and we're going to travel to Lethbridge Lord willing and participate in the service and I believe brother Toby's going to take the service there is that right I have it wrong sorry further Emanuel has it I'd forgive me Brothers I don't know why I can't get that rotation right I I don't know there's something wrong with me I think we're going to Lethbridge on the weekend and we're going to take in the service with brother Emmanuel we'll pray for you brother Emmanuel forgive me for always getting that wrong I don't know why I feel like I'm uh I feel like I'm starting to blush now we'll just get into our scriptures here in uh first John chapter 3. behold we'll start with verse one behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is let's just turn back over to Isaiah chapter 43. tonight I want to talk about the sons of God and I just want to title it my son if I can put a title to it chapter 43. verse 1 Isaiah chapter 43 Verse 1. but now thus saith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine will now passes through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee will thou walketh through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for thee since thou was precious in my sight my thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him let's just bow in prayer once again oh gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus to read these scriptures and to know by revelation the magnitude of what they're saying father I pray that tonight you would just expound upon this word Lord that you would just break it open fresh to us Lord that father that there wouldn't be anyone whose eyes would roll and say we've just read the same scripture over again but Lord Jesus that you would take it and make it fresh and new for us Lord that you would just help us to express that heart desire Lord that you have placed in US father Lord that we could recognize who we are so that this Rapture can go father I pray that we could all just pull our licks of fire together tonight Lord and that the speaker and the hearer could be one that it would be in your spirit Lord Jesus that we would be together in one mind and one Accord For Your Glory we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated try not to get too excited and preach too long tonight I just want to go back and and talk about what we were at on Sunday being loosed from sin and I just feel impressed to read this paragraph 120 you know out of Romans is what brother Bradham is reading really he's he's speaking to and uh he reads the scripture wrote or quotes it Romans 8 33 and 34. he says There It Is death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation How can there be and there's no no condemnation to the sons and the daughters of God to his children is what he's talking about here just for those people who who don't know and I just want to say this I'll stop right here if there's anybody new in our midst virtually welcome I trust that the Lord will speak to you that you'll feel welcome and uh we'll get to know you soon sooner or later he goes on to say there is nothing to be condemned for we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals and fills with the Holy Ghost in power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood so brothers and sisters I just would like to start with that tonight don't be bound down with traditions and and teachings and and and cunningly devised fables and and the the the spirits that would try and deceive man to draw them unto men instead of pointing towards Christ there is one one message for our day and that's to get into Christ and not just to get into Christ but to get Christ into you the person of Jesus Christ that's the message of the hour that's what we preach Christ crucified but also resurrected and and not just resurrected in some other dimension somewhere out there but resurrected right here in our hearts in the kingdom of God he said that the kingdom of God is with you but it's it's without observation and that's why people can't see it because it's inside the human being and we are either influenced by one Spirit or the other and there's no middle ground and that's Satan's Eden is to make it sound like there's so many different shades of gray so many different mixtures of the power of God God is is is great in one person and small in another person and and another person is demon-filled another person just has a little bit of of of weird anxiety in their life it's not the way it is it's either God or it's Satan it's one or the other it's like binary code it's one or it's zero there's not a mixture it doesn't work that way God will not share his glory with anyone he doesn't want to share his throne with anyone he will not share his throne with anyone and his throne today is on the throne room of our hearts but brothers and sisters I don't want to go down that far too that road too far tonight I want to talk about being sons of God that's really what I want to talk about and I'll tell you why I I had this this this kind of deviation this morning after my devotions I I had a conversation our youngest son came down stairs from from sleeping the night and uh you know everyone else in the house was gone it was just him and I there and I think as a minister as as human beings as Sons and Daughters of God we've got to go with the leadership of the Lord and I I just I couldn't get away from this all day it just hit me like a truck this morning my youngest son comes downstairs and uh and he's still sleepy and and I said to him you know how about you just come over and why don't you just come and get a good morning hug so happy to see you and and to see his sleepy eyes and just to see my son there you know it just made me feel so good and uh that's how he came over and I gave him a hug and and I said to him you know I sure love you and this has really been on my heart recently you know brothers and sisters how how easy it is to take for granted every single day the Lord's just really been dealing with me on on this level and I I trust that everything is fine but when we leave the house in the morning and we go to work even as Christians even as message Believers even as the bride even as Sons and Daughters of God there's no guarantee that we're coming home again at the end of the day to be with our family there's no guarantee the last time that we leave our house and say goodbye honey that might be the very last time we have the opportunity to use our lips and speak to those people that we love and like I said the Lord's just really been dealing with me on that I guess I've taken it for granted and I've I've gone out and I've worked hard and I've just put my head down and thought you know the kids and the wife and whatever they'll just be fine they'll be there when I get home but what if I don't come home what if they don't come home I'm not saying they will or they won't I'm not trying to say anything weird or prophetic don't get me wrong I'm just saying we can't take for granted these things in our lives maybe it's not our children maybe it's our wives maybe it's just gathering together here before a pandemic hits seeing our brothers and sisters here and then suddenly next week we can't it's over that's what happened here going back to the story this is what inspired me for tonight I see my son he comes down he's sleepy I think look at my boy I just love him so much my heart's just wanting to burst I see my son there come and have a hug son come and fellowship with me and he comes over and he does that and I say to him I love you Christopher I just love you so much and I don't love you any more that I love the others Benjamin and Isaac just for the record but I love you so much and and and he says okay I love you too Daddy and I say you know I'm so proud of you son and he says why are you proud of me Daddy and I'm like wow what kind of a question is that that's great what a good question and and he says to me is it because I'm an expert skier and I'm like what what is that and and Meanwhile my heart's just about to explode because I'm just so so caught up in the moment with my son and I I say to him you know what it is Christopher it's not because of anything it's just because you're my son it's just because you are my son you are an expressed image of me and then I began to think about it what did I just say I don't think I said that I think the Lord said that because it made me think that must be how he looks at his true Sons and Daughters of God it's it's not because we go out and achieve a great test score in in University it's not because we go out and and make millions of dollars it's not because we can preach it's not because we can sing it's not because of anything that we can do there's nothing we can do to Merit the favor of being a son or daughter of God it's just because just because it put me on the floor today it still is oh my goodness I just can't even express it to think about it if we are Sons and Daughters it's only because he chose us it's only because he chose us to be his son I'd like to say that I chose my son to be my son but I didn't but you know what the beautiful thing is we know brother Branham teaches this really well he says that if you're he's your son he was always in you he was always in you when you were a son and and an apple tree has apples on it the fruit and the seeds are in the fruit and and when you look at a seed of an apple for an apple tree all of the potential of that giant apple tree is in that tiny little seed all of the apples that will ever come out of it are in that tiny tiny little seed all of the genetics are already there to look at my son and think that is a very expressed image of me to look at all three of my sons and say wow those are expressed images of me they were always in me they were a part of me and there's no way ever that they could not be a part of me I could try and say no you're not my son no I'm not your dad it doesn't matter what I say or do I could never change that genetic code it is always going to be there and brothers and sisters if you are Sons and Daughters of God there's nothing you can do to change that I guess that's what the Lord is dealing with Me overall if we're Sons and Daughters of God we have nothing to fear because he has all of it under control doesn't matter what comes our way it doesn't matter if things upset in the church it doesn't matter what happens in our families doesn't matter if we don't come home or not God has it all under control I don't even know why I'm talking like that it's so bizarre go on to our scripture tonight over in in first John I just I just felt so blessed to hear that this morning and and not you know just the exchange to think my goodness once upon a time I wanted to rush out the door all the time and just go to work and try and do my best to make it happen now I want to just take the time and see the children and say wow that's my Heritage that's how God is starting to just get maybe a tiny little glimpse of maybe what God thinks about me when he looks at me when I wake up in the morning do I take the time to go and just spend time with him and put my arms around him and say I love you Daddy do I do that my but when I do what's his response can you imagine being able to just go to him and ask whatsoever you will in my name and I'll give it to you wow it's not anything that we can do we're not meriting anything we can't go to him and say well I prayed 14 times in a row every single day on my knees with the lights turned off and nobody there now give it to me that's not the way it works he's not a vending machine no no no no no in chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us us and I know I'm talking about Sons tonight specifically because it's scripture and there's you know a message quote for it but but brothers and sisters I want to be clear we're talking about God's children when we say Sons the sons of God we're talking about the Sons and Daughters of God because all of the daughters came out of the sons right we're all one it has to be that way but behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed I took a look at that word bestowed out of the the Noah Webster's Dictionary and it says given gratuitously conferred laid out applied deposited for safe keeping can you imagine that his life his love bestowed upon us for safekeeping that's amazing when you go back though and just a little bit when you look at gratuitously given gratuitously it's it's from the word gratuity is a free gift a present a donation that which is given without compensation or equivalent it's just given as a free gift it's just God's life given unto us and Satan wants us to think that we don't have God's life because look at that thing in your life look at that that that trial or or that trouble or that thing that you just can't seem to get past no no no that's just this flesh we've just bypassed our theophany bodies you know I heard it said and I thought it was so good that our theophany bodies now are exactly on the other side just waiting for us and we have the soul with us but there's going to be a day where we either pass away and our soul goes over there and meets up with that body or our soul just leaves this body and that body comes to the soul and we just see that meeting in the air and one day it's gonna happen brothers and sisters it's gonna happen it's imminent but that word bestowed given gratuitously just a free gift it's a present it's a donation and it's conferred to the part of the definition is conferred for the word bestowed confer to give or or bestow it says this is now uh Noah Webster's um I guess I don't even know what you'd call it someone would probably know what this term is it's it's a little write-up it's a paragraph about the description of this word maybe it's just a description of the word but the word conferred confer to give or to bestow he says this word is particularly used to express the grant of favors benefits and privileges to be enjoyed or rights which are permanent all of that coming out of the word bestowed behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us what manner of love the father has has given us to grant us favors and benefits and privileges to be enjoyed because their rights which are permanent imagine that Sons and Daughters of God obtaining their inheritance realizing who they are you know you look at Kings in the world in the natural type you see Kings and they have queens and they have princes and and princesses there comes a point in time where those children realize that they have authority and they have rights and they're not like everyone else and you know Naturally Speaking what it does is it Puffs people up it puts people into a different state very rarely are they not puffed up it's almost not even possible for them because they live in a different world but you know it's the opposite with a Christian when they actually get that Life of Christ in them that realization sets in that I don't have anything to fear because I know who I am and I know what I'm raised up for it's that original life that lives out through me and that's God's own life but to think about it it's it's it's it's Privileges and benefits and rights which are to be permanent and like we said on Sunday this is just really starting to take hold with me just in my life and my Ministry how amazing it is how God chooses words very specifically these men that wrote the Bible were not the authors they're scribes they're they're men that God chose to scribe out the words and those words that were translated through all the years many people would say today oh you know there's many versions of the Bible and many different different discussions about that but it's no it's no accident that we have the exact translation that we do that the prophet of God would send for this age that he would choose the King James version it's no accident that we had a a scholarly man like brother Lee Vale to be the the grammarizer for the church age book all of these words that we talk about and that we hear they're for a very specific purpose and to look at them like this I think for me it's just it's it's like the burst of a Roman Candle it's like one goes and then it bursts and then another one bursts from that one and it's it's amazing for me just to look at this but to think about this this love of the father that he's bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God he's deposited for safe keeping in his sons and todders behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not and if we recall a real real real famous scripture I would say something that brother Ken said a lot of he said herein is our love made perfect this is a little further that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we're not just Barry Johnson we're not just brother so and so sister so and so we are literally the manifestation of the sons of God his life his children and and there's no way that those those genes can be changed there's no way that it can ever be changed I just keep getting off on tangents forgive me brother Bradham says in things that are to be in 1965 now the only way that you can be a son or a daughter of God because you have to be have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life he says only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father amen before there was even a molecule see foreign God's own life brothers and sisters and you are nothing I just love this you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God sons of God he says now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age it hasn't come into us just so that we can say high five we're Sons and Daughters of God we've got a special club that we attend and we've got privileges that are permanent no it's so that we can light up this age with his life and show people that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that there is a god with skin on there is someone that actually cares for you you are the expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God I'll just go back and read the paragraph now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age you are the expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you are now made you're setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate Wherever You Are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be I love that if you ever if you've got to turn a life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here it just takes all the pressure off when you can zoom out and start to look at at at the entirety of of life from this perspective it just takes all the pressure off and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you you it expressed in a being not just any being brothers and sisters Sons and Daughters of God now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see I just this just does it for me to think about what happened the exchange this morning just to see my son and have that Revelation that oh my and then to look it up and hear him say this now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwells in you it's not just I've got a ticket to Heaven I've got the token it's not that it's not that I'm associated with the church and I'm I'm just God eternal life because I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again yeah we do but remember brother Branham didn't come to this world to just preach to everyone he didn't come to this world just to talk to the ten virgins he came to this world to talk to the five wise virgins and we're talking about the five wise virgins tonight those ones that realize they are truly the genetic Gene seed of God if they have eternal life in them they had it from before the foundation of the world not because of anything they've done not because of anything they could ever do or or could ever even imagine it's just because God chose them and that in itself when that Revelation breaks forth and sets in to a son and daughter of God it changes everything about them everything about them if they had air in their tires that air gets let out right now it doesn't puff people up it brings people down to earth and shows them that it's only by God Sovereign Grace that we have the ability to understand those things we can see a lot of people now that are cloaked in in religion they've got big fig leaves covering their bodies and they're not afraid to actually show it and they're not afraid to actually destroy people using the word you know what God didn't send Jesus to the Earth God didn't come to the Earth in Jesus to destroy people he came to the Earth to save people and he didn't come to the Earth to minister to the most religious folks of the day he actually came to condemn those ones he came to save the sinners I just love this quote I'm going to say it again now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that that eternal life dwells in you we don't ever want to take for granted brothers and sisters any moment of any day when we have an opportunity to look at someone we love and just tell them that we love them because we never know we never know we might have to wait until we get over Yonder to be able to say it but you know the Bible speaks about the sons of God I'll just go through these quickly for time's sake here in Genesis 6 talking about the sons of God Genesis 6 verse 2. that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children unto them and the same Mighty Men which were of old men of renown and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually brothers and sisters were not very far away from that right now if if not there entirely right now I remember in Noah's day there was only eight Souls that were saved and that was only because they actually received the message for their day they knew that it was it was either get in the boat or you're going to perish and uh I'm not going to go down that road tonight we're talking about the sons of God and uh you know just this little sidebar how the thoughts of his heart in the hearts of men was only evil continually and what we're talking about there isn't necessarily murders and drunkenness and and and and and bad evil things like that we're talking about unbelief the word is talking about anything but the word of God anything but the word of God but the truth is evil and that's what he's talking about here in job one verse six now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them job 2 again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord in Job 38 verse 4. this is this is Elohim this is the god almighty speaking to job now out of the Whirlwind where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof and and this is the the verse that I wanted to get to but just to paint the picture to think that the Lord Of Glory is expressing it to man to his son where were you when all of that was created when I did all of that where were you trying to get his attention so that he would come to that that realization remember how the prophet says it that there came a point where that lightning flashed and and the Thunder cracked and and he said you know I I know my redeemer lives because even though the skin worms they destroy this flesh I will stand and see my Lord but verse 7 says when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy think of that picture right there when the morning Stars sang together and the son all of the sons of God showed up for Joy so it's not even just a group of sons of God brothers and sisters it's talking about an eternal all sons of God if you are a son of God today and you have eternal life today then you were there in that scripture you were right there in God when the morning Stars sang together and all of the sons of God shouted for Joy that's why when we I don't know when we start to think about election and that's part of this that's probably the main part of it the I don't even know what you'd call it the background thought of election brothers and sisters to think that he has called us it's not just like God just had children and suddenly he's got this great son that he just loves and and starts to love him more and more and starts to fellowship and get to know him he knew all about us before the foundation of the world he created us and formed him formed Us in him it's just amazing to think about this is election we're talking about it's it's not just being a son or a daughter of God he he elected us to be exactly who we are with all of the faults and failures that we have so that we can lay down our will and overcome all of those to create the character that we need to be fit to rule and Reign to sit with him in his throne which no other age has that promise in in in John 1 verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God [Music] even to them that believe on his name and I love how he just expresses this he switches it from being almost carnal to being spiritual he goes on to say in verse 13. which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God I'm just going to back up and read read this again and and we'll we'll stop there and just examine this for a second here he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God and then one of the most famous verses that we know and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and you know this this is a really familiar scripture and and we're probably not going to get too far into it tonight but you know what if we're Sons and Daughters of God then we truly are the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ on Earth today we are his fleshly image on Earth today and that's what stumbles the world that's why brother Branham said that when the church recognizes what it is literally flesh the Lord Jesus Christ his Spirit raised that raised up Jesus from the dead living out through me quickening all of our mortal bodies because it's the Lord Jesus Christ spirit in US we're not ourselves we're no longer the same creatures we're new creatures in Christ Jesus remember this now and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we beheld his glory how many times brothers and sisters do we get in a good service or in a real good prayer meeting with the Lord Jesus Christ and we have that that morning moment where we can just put our arms around the Lord and just say I love you Daddy how many times do we see his glory do we behold his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth those moments that you can't even explain to someone because you know it's just you and God and when he speaks to you sovereignly you just speak back and say blessed be the name of the Lord that you would call me a Son of God behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon me that I should be called The Son of God I never did nothing I'm a rat from from the gutter if I look at myself as a human being but that's not the way he sees me he sees me as a direct image of his own jeans why Hallelujah and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth I just love that do we have Grace and Truth are we just full of grace and truth one for the other you know if you go on to read in in first John it says he who says that he loveth his brother but hateth him or loves loves the Lord sorry but hateth is brother is a liar we need to be careful not get caught up in the flesh don't stumble at the Veil if God has chosen someone even if we know that someone might be in error on the word they might have time to grow you never know there's progressive revelation for a prophet there's progressive revelation for other human beings as well nobody's going to fulfill the office of a prophet I'm not saying that but what I am saying is that we all need room to grow Sons and Daughters need to be taught we need to have the ability to learn we need encouragement we've said it before when you're teaching a child to walk and and they stumble and they fall you don't kick them and say get up and walk I told you how to do it no you pick them up and you love them and you encourage them some more and you say come on honey you're an Express image of me and I want to see you just learn to walk I want to see you be free and not be stumbling and crawling and toddling same thing with our brothers and our sisters Romans chapter 8 verse 11 that famous scripture but if the Same Spirit if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you not that's just going to come to you one day it's it's dwelling in you right now therefore brethren we are not debtors to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die don't look at your brother and sister don't look at me don't look at yourself look to Christ look at the word for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God bye I have to say that's almost one of my favorite verses right there Romans 8 chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear when your sons and daughters and you know who your daddy is we know who has it all under control we haven't received the spirit of bondage in fear and everything that happens to us when situations arise no we look at the situations and we say blessed be the name of the Lord I know that he's allowed this to come my way because nothing happens on Earth unless there's first a council in heaven unless the devil has to come before the Lord to see if he can actually do something to us remember the story in in job we just glossed right over it I don't really want to go too far into that tonight but Satan came and had a discussion with God and it was God that said to Satan have you considered my servant job you know what you've been up to Satan walking around to and fro up and down in the earth just hanging out seeing whom I can devour like I'm supposed to be according to your word and he says oh really have you considered my servant job you know we just need to step back and look at that scripture and think you know when the Trials come our way when we get right down in the valley just remember that there's a counsel happen in heaven there's a conversation between those two because Satan is still there he still has an audience with almighty God until the time the bride goes up but while he's there don't don't think it's strange think it not strange when the fiery trial comes upon you brothers and sisters because it's as good as gold for us it's the Refiner's Fire in our lives but that's that's that's God potentially saying have you considered my brother Joel if you consider my son Joel down there have you considered my sisters my son my daughter Stella down there you know there's there's someone there that I know you will never get to curse me to my face because they're truly a son and a daughter of the most high God but you know what go ahead and try everything you want but don't take their life can you imagine that there's nothing in this world for us there's nothing in this world for us God is not concerned about all the things in this world what he is concerned about is our souls and if we're willing to give back to him his rightful portion the praise of our lips the the the very essence of our lives our sacred portion if we're willing to give that back to him then he will reward us but brothers and sisters it's only temporal it's only a temporary thing don't get attached to anything down here we don't want that we don't want that we want to be able to go when it's time to go he says in verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father Hallelujah Lord I'm so thankful that I can call you Daddy I know that you are my my father and that you have it all under control when I go on my knees and I pray to my heavenly father I know that he hears my prayer and I know that he answers my prayer and all I need to do is just Rejoice because he has it all under control and he knew what prayer I was going to pray he knew why I was going to pray it and he's already answered it and all I need to do is thank him for answering it imagine in the exchange like I just described earlier if if if my son said Daddy I'm hungry I want some breakfast and I said okay and and and he just said to me I'm hungry Daddy get my breakfast can you get my breakfast I'm so hungry Daddy and and just continually go on like that when I already told him okay but I still have to get up off of the couch and walk across the house to go and get the stuff and and make it happen for him we know that God is omnipotent and omnipresent and and all the different omnis there's so many things about God but still there's times where he makes us wait yes sir he wants us to trust him and he doesn't want us to just trust him he wants us to demonstrate our trust in him [Music] and sadly as parents I think we do that to our children I know I do I I want I want them to demonstrate their trust in me sometimes and you know it's kind of like brother Branham gives that example about going across in a wheelbarrow he talks about that story about the pastor going over the the I think it's a board or a rope in a wheelbarrow and and yeah sure Pastor I believe that you could do it on your own you could balance it no problem and I believe that you could do it with weight and and no problem Pastor the pastor says okay now you get in and I'll take you across no no no no no no no [Laughter] God wants us to demonstrate our faith in him brothers and sisters he doesn't want us to just say I believe that's why we get the Fiery trials that's why things happen in our lives we need to ask him for it and just like we've talked about with John Ryan not go and cry about it over and over again go back in the prayer line and say pray for me again anoint me with oil again no no no no no no no Brother Brad I'm gonna say that's all wrong he told John Ryan when he came back in the line he said to him I thought you said I was healed brother Branham what was his response let's remember it wasn't just brother Branham standing there it was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking through him not saying that he was the Lord Jesus Christ standing there it was the same Spirit speaking through him his voice box he said to him I thought you said you believed we need to make sure that we're demonstrating Faith to the Lord if we want to see prayer in action we want to see the answers to our prayers it was only after John Ryan went I don't know for weeks rejoicing acting like a fanatic praising God for something that nobody else could see he couldn't see it he didn't even have sight but by faith he had it for as many as they're led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God are you led by the spirit of God tonight brothers and sisters if you are then you have received the spirit of adoption and you have the ability to cry Abba Father thank you Lord Jesus for saving me thank you Lord Jesus for giving me the ability to see the word for my day thank you the Lord Jesus for giving me all of the needs every single need in my life that I have and if you have fear brothers and sisters remember it's a spirit of bondage that's coming upon you that's trying to get you you know I I can only say that because I've experienced it I had fear tremendous fear so much I couldn't even breathe I I would have my heart would just pound and my pulse would just race and and I thought that you know what it was I thought that it was just me I made a mistake and and and I didn't realize that it was a spirit until afterwards but blessed be the name of the Lord for him to reveal that stuff to us that it's actually a spirit of fear fear is a spirit if we're afraid brothers and sisters let's let's get rid of that spirit all we have to do is cast it out rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ come to him and repent make sure that everything is is right in your life as good as you can and you might have things in your life that you can't go and physically make right God knows your heart so long as your heart is right if your heart is right it doesn't condemn you then ask what you will we haven't received the spirit of bondage again to fear no no no no no no we've received the spirit of adoption where we know our rights we know that we're Sons and Daughters we've been given the ability to understand who we are why because the spirit itself it Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we live our lives according to the word we don't come to church and say I believe the message of the hour and I I believe what God's word says I believe it all and then go into a dirty business deal on Monday just so I can succeed a little more we don't do that we don't go and have just the odd odd odd swear word just slip out just because we just I just got mad my temper it just gets it just gets to me it's just my flesh we don't live our lives that way we don't just go and and do things in the world like worldly people do the spirit itself beareth witness that with our spirit that we are the children of God we express the Lord Jesus Christ to this world around us we read it in that quote earlier to this dark world where the light of Jesus to this world in our church in our neighborhoods in our schools at our workplace wherever we are we're expressing the light of the Lord Jesus Christ if the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together to think about that brothers and sisters the spirit itself we could we could take that word out and I I know we're not going to add or take away I'm not looking to bring the curse of Revelation here but I just want to just throw this one word in here just for the sake of discussion tonight the spirit himself not itself let's let's change it just a little bit so that we can look at it from a different perspective that Spirit itself comes into our life but it changes us into a different person we become a new creature so I would say this tonight the spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ the true baptism of the Holy Spirit causes us to live different lives well we're truly Sons and Daughters of God we can't impersonate that and if children then we're heirs heirs With God all the promises every chapter every verse every line all of it in the Bible is ours we don't have to worry about whether we'll have our needs provided for we don't have to worry about whether we'll have healing in our body you know what whether we have healing in our body or or whether we live or whether we die we're Christ and you know what they say brothers and sisters I don't know maybe it's because I haven't had a life or death situation and you know I I can tell you that I have had some in my life and maybe one day with the testimony service will do it but I haven't had a crazy disease or anything like that you know thanks be to God I'm not going to just dismiss that but what I will say is I think it's very true what you hear said and and you know I don't know I I need to be careful what I say I get it but you know what what's said carnally is that you're not ready to live until you're ready to die think about David when he went out to see Goliath that day I don't think that he had any doubt in his heart or his mind that he would die even though that devil called out to him and said I'm going to feed you to the birds right David had something in him there was a spirit of adoption in David to go out there and face Goliath but I've just felt this for a long time and you know what maybe the Lord will test me on it and you know what if that's his will then I know his will will be perfect and it will be for his his glory it won't be for me it will be all for him but you know I don't believe it myself that we're really ready to live until we're ready to die until we know that we have our Eternal destination fixed up when we know that whether we live or whether we die we're Christ's what difference does it make of course we want to live a full life but think about how free we could live our lives if we knew that nothing could stop us and if nothing can stop us if God before us who could be against us brothers and sisters you know what it is it's fear that drives our decisions many times fear grips us and and we don't need to be afraid we don't have to be afraid of what a doctor says to us if a doctor says something to us you know what it's only going to be for for God's glory either he's going to take me home or he's going to heal me one of the other is going to happen only one or the other is going to happen he's going to heal me or he's going to take me home and either way I win and it's going to be for a testimony of the Lord because that Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God he goes on to say for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed where in US amen Sons and Daughters of God for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God all of creation is just groaning for us to come to full maturity to come to the place where we're not afraid where we don't have fear because perfect love remember perfect love casteth out all fear when we have perfect love that's the Lord Jesus Christ that's the spirit of adoption living out through us in Philippians 2 wherefore my beloved does ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you in you both to will and do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God think about that scripture there do all things without murmurings and disputings murmurings grumbling I've got this to do again I got to go and deal with them again I got to go to church again do it without murmurings brothers and sisters remember what happened to the children of Israel for murmuring murmurings in the wilderness didn't go well for them do all things he says without murmurings and disputings getting upset with one another coming together and and disputing things having arguments and disagreements disputing that ye may be blameless and harmless because I know Daddy's got it all under control I know I know whom I have believed and he is able to keep that which he has promised amen that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world again talking about being sons and daughters that are just shining light into this world his Spirit living out through Us in Investments brother Bradham says no wonder Jesus said if he abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will see the works that I do John 14 12 he that believeth confessed and believeth on me see the works that I do shall he do also because God is in The Believer just like he was in Christ God is in The Believer just like he was in Christ not in the fullness he was in Christ but he is in you just like he was because you are a son of God through Jesus Christ our words have power brothers and sisters we need to be super careful I believe this with all my heart maybe it's just my opinion but whatever it's for free when we get right with God and everything in our life is in perfect harmony with the word we need to be so careful with our words because our words have power and we can create things we can cause things we can see things happen by our words our words we have the creative ability brother Bradham says to create worlds and go and live on them that power is in us right now we need to be careful what we say he was in Christ but he is in you just like he was because you are a son of God through Jesus Christ I've got one more quote as we close here I'll call the musicians up convinced and then concerned he says and remember when you die that Soul leaves you it never changes no sir death doesn't change the soul it changes his dwelling place but it's still the same soul so if it isn't born again and a part of the eternal spirit of God it had a beginning anything with a beginning has an end stand with me tonight if you will that's the reason God's the only things Eternal unless you're born again and have eternal life the Greek word Zoe there means God's own life in you you'll perish but where God's life is in you you can no more perish than God can perish that's right and you know brothers and sisters I'll throw this out there that's why so many people are afraid because they don't know God's own life they don't have that Zoe life in them because if they had it in them they'd have perfect love and perfect love would cast out fear but they don't even realize why they're so gripped with fear but it's because if they meet their deathbed if they're going to have their last breath they know deep down inside their subconscious knows for sure that they're lost as lost can be without that life in them but where God's life is in you you can no more perish than God can perish that's right because you are a son an offspring of God and have eternal life oh that's the thing the church needs then when God is in you then he lives his own life through you see and that's how we know we're Christians then you're concerned about your brother that's how we know we're Christians brothers and sisters because he lives his life out through us that Spirit beareth witness itself in our own lives we don't live our lives according to our will many times we'll say you know I really would like to do that but we know the scripture says that we ought to say Lord willing I'll go and do that and we need to say that Lord willing we'll see what the Lord wants because it's all about his will not ours which is totally contrary to what the world teaches you know that scripture in in Isaiah 43. brothers and sisters you are mine is what he said I have formed you I have called you by name man just to think about that the Lord Jesus Christ saying just come and give me a hug son just just come and give me a hug daughter I I just long to fellowship with you I just long to have that personal relationship with you I just long to hear those words come out of your mouth and hit my ears to see my life being lived out through you I just long to hear that and brothers and sisters make no doubt about it that our our Papa god daddy he's proud of us he's proud of you why just because you're his son just because you're his daughter not because of anything we could do not because of anything we'll ever do it's just because and Satan wants us to believe anything but that it's just because he chose us in him before the foundation of the world my goodness because you are my son that's it there's no there's no conditions to it there's no conditions to it this really put me in check with my own house I'm going to be the I Am The Watchman of my own house I need to be watching what's going on and making sure everything is good but you know what it did for me it really like over the last 12 hours 14 hours it's put something in me that's made me consider it in a different way my my sons will now and and you know I know I guess it sounds crazy but it's true we all have an opportunity to receive a revelation and blessed be the name of the Lord when it happens I've got a revelation my sons don't need to achieve anything to be my son it's not conditional and my sons don't need to achieve anything for me to be proud of them because I'm proud of to have them as my sons I can you imagine that that's how he sees us he's proud just to have us as children and when we get that Revelation it just causes us to just cry out to him and thank him oh my goodness let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord what manner of love you have bestowed upon us Lord Jesus permanent privilege that we should be called the sons of God that we should be called this the daughters of god father that you would call us by name that you would give us that Revelation father that we're not worried about being joined to an association we're worried about getting your spirit in us we're worried about getting that Divine love as as the very essence of Our Lives because when we have Divine love it casts out all fear and when all fear is gone there's nothing that can stop us because it's not even us it's you it's your spirit living out through US Lord father what a an incredible blessing it is to know that we are your children I pray Lord Jesus that you would just take the words that were spoken tonight and just bind them up in the hearts of your children father that you would just allow them to be consumed by The Souls of your children father that you would just forgive me if I've said anything wrong or or not the way you wanted it to be said Lord I pray that you would just translate it the way that you want it to be translated to your children tonight father that if we are Sons and Daughters today then we always were and and that can never change it doesn't matter what comes our way father we just love you so much we're so thankful for your grace and for your mercy to us for your traveling mercy so many times Lord when we go to school and when we come home and when we go to work and when we come home every single day that we leave our house Lord Jesus every time that we open our eyes in the morning Father and we have even a little bit of good health it's it's only because of your grace that we have breath in our lungs father help us to use it for your glory help us to shine your light and your life to this Dying World around us Lord Jesus that each and every one of us could fulfill the ministry that you have given us to this Dying World Lord father what an honor and a privilege it is to be called a Son of God I pray that you would just be glorified now as we sing a couple songs that you would just allow us to water that word father with our praise as we go our separate ways just watch over your children I ask Lord until we come together again in your name until you bring us back together to Fellowship Lord bless the service on Sunday here breast the service on Sunday in Lethbridge we pray that you would just be glorified now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can't believe
