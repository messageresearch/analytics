[44:58] he's been here a few times in the past I
[45:01] understand and uh he will be here on
[45:04] Sunday June the second as
[45:06] well we have uh just a little
[45:09] announcement we we've got a Bible study
[45:11] group wanting to start up and uh brother
[45:15] brother Don and brother Casey brother
[45:18] Paul have desired to do a Bible study
[45:21] for those people who are interested it
[45:23] will take place in the basement of the
[45:25] church every second
[45:27] Friday um from 7:00 onwards 7 till 8: or
[45:31] 9 I don't think they want to make it too
[45:33] long but just for a bit of Fellowship
[45:35] around the word and uh it will happen
[45:38] every two weeks it's something new and
[45:40] we're just going to start it up and try
[45:43] it out and for those people that want to
[45:44] attend Christian Fellowship then you're
[45:46] more than welcome to attend and if you
[45:48] don't want to then that's all right as
[45:50] well it's just going to be to meet
[45:53] together and discuss personal highlights
[45:55] of a message uh they want to set it up
[45:57] in such a way that the group takes two
[45:59] weeks to read a selected message and
[46:01] then meet to discuss the Revelation and
[46:03] personal highlights of that message I
[46:06] think it can be uh a really wonderful
[46:09] thing just to see what the mind of the
[46:11] Lord is through many different people I
[46:14] am a part of a morning Bible study where
[46:17] that happens I'm not on it every day but
[46:20] um you get a lot of different
[46:22] perspectives when you get together and
[46:24] you start fellowshipping around the
[46:25] words so I guess they're aiming to start
[46:27] that April the 5th and uh if you have
[46:30] any questions or concerns by all means
[46:33] just reach out and uh we'll be certainly
[46:35] happy to talk to you about it I think
[46:37] there's also going to be a chat group
[46:39] for it um initially Brother Don said
[46:41] that he would I think plan to use the
[46:44] men's chat for it just to do updates and
[46:48] uh communication through it so uh I
[46:51] don't know if there will be a separate
[46:52] chat for it we'll just see how it
[46:54] progresses how it evolves and uh if it's
[46:57] blessing are you happy tonight amen
[47:00] certainly uh sure sign of spring here in
[47:02] these parts to see
[47:05] snow and uh I think it's not done we're
[47:08] supposed to see quite a bit of snow but
[47:10] who knows what could happen the Lord
[47:11] does he knows what's going to happen and
[47:14] uh we'll just leave it in his hands I
[47:16] believe tomorrow night also we had
[47:18] scheduled a prayer meeting here at the
[47:20] church so we will definitely uh be
[47:23] planning to go forwards with that unless
[47:25] we have Epic amounts of snow we
[47:28] certainly don't want to put people in
[47:29] Peril to come out to the church but
[47:32] we'll just see and uh we'll communicate
[47:34] if it does get too
[47:37] bad last week we talked about the
[47:41] Ephesian Church age and the complaint of
[47:43] God Revelations 2:4 nevertheless I have
[47:46] somewhat against thee because thou Hast
[47:48] left thy first love and you know brother
[47:51] bradam he talks about how God has no
[47:54] grandchildren and you you know how it is
[47:58] there's no such thing as Apostolic
[48:00] succession we'll get into that a little
[48:02] further tonight but just because our
[48:04] parents are saved and and a part of the
[48:06] message of the hour Believers that
[48:08] doesn't mean that we are we all have to
[48:11] have an upper room experience we know
[48:13] brother brandham said very clearly that
[48:15] even Mary the mother of Jesus who has
[48:17] been exalted so greatly by the Catholic
[48:20] church and many others she herself had
[48:25] to go into that upper room and receive
[48:27] the Holy Ghost as well it's not uh
[48:30] something that just happens because
[48:31] you're associated with someone or you're
[48:33] associated with Jesus you have to get to
[48:36] know him personally you have to have a
[48:38] personal relationship with him and you
[48:39] know outside of getting the holy ghost
[48:41] in your life I don't think you really
[48:43] can have a personal relationship with
[48:45] Jesus Christ brother Bram says you're
[48:47] not even converted until you receive the
[48:49] Holy Ghost
[48:51] amen you know uh brother Bram he talks
[48:54] about that on on the prior pages I don't
[48:57] really want to go too far back um but
[48:59] just to carry on paragraph 90 we left
[49:02] off right here um about just maybe
[49:06] paragraph 89 you know how they they
[49:09] would pray all night they took the
[49:11] street corners the the people in Ephesus
[49:13] and they weren't ashamed of the
[49:14] manifestations of the spirit they left
[49:17] their old dead churches and worshiped in
[49:20] homes or old store buildings he says
[49:22] they had
[49:24] reality and that was a good perspective
[49:26] on the word they understood the word of
[49:28] God for their day and they weren't
[49:30] willing to take the nickan spirit they
[49:34] weren't interested in the leadership of
[49:36] men they were in the interested in
[49:38] leadership of the Holy Ghost in their
[49:40] lives paragraph 90 brother bradam he
[49:42] goes on to say but it wasn't too long of
[49:44] a time until they began to get enough
[49:46] money to build fine new churches they
[49:50] put in a choir instead of singing unto
[49:52] God for themselves they put gowns on the
[49:56] choir
[49:57] they organized a movement and ran it by
[50:00] man they soon began to read books that
[50:03] weren't fit to read they let down the
[50:06] bars and the goats came in and took over
[50:09] the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of
[50:12] the spirit was gone oh they kept on with
[50:15] a form but the fire had died down and
[50:19] the Blackness of Ashes is all is about
[50:22] all that is
[50:24] left I just think that's such an
[50:26] interesting paragraph because we know
[50:29] that we have seen it in uh churches and
[50:34] you know even around the message of the
[50:36] hour
[50:38] we have people that would take this
[50:40] paragraph to heart and you can see that
[50:44] if you were to use the word program then
[50:47] it would become a big deal if you say
[50:50] that we've got a Sunday school program
[50:52] in the church it can become a big deal
[50:54] because brother bradam he talks about
[50:55] the leadership of men man instead of the
[50:57] leadership of the Holy Ghost trading
[51:00] power for programs is what brother Bram
[51:02] says very specifically but when we talk
[51:04] about this paragraph here you know they
[51:07] got money enough to buy fine new
[51:08] churches and they put in a choir instead
[51:10] of singing unto God for themselves they
[51:12] put gowns on the choir they organized a
[51:15] movement and ran it by man it is very
[51:18] important for the church brothers and
[51:20] sisters to not try and make everything
[51:23] too organized by man we have got to have
[51:27] the Holy Spirit leadership in the church
[51:30] if we don't have the Holy Spirit
[51:31] leadership in the church then we might
[51:33] as well stay
[51:34] home we might as well stay home there's
[51:37] no point to come to church if we get so
[51:39] formal with our worship so formal with
[51:43] our preaching so formal with our Forum
[51:46] in the church what we do is we choke out
[51:49] the liberty of the Holy Ghost if we get
[51:52] too worried about what people are going
[51:53] to think if we're too worried about
[51:55] having everything perfect in the music
[51:57] if every note has to be exact if every
[52:00] song that's sung has to be
[52:02] specific you know what we do we just
[52:04] stop the Holy Ghost right there we
[52:06] ground the power of the spirit right
[52:08] there that's what that paragraph is
[52:10] talking about and it can be taken too
[52:11] far it can go so far the other way the
[52:14] pendulum swings both ways the devil
[52:17] loves that because if he can't get you
[52:18] too far on one side he'll just push you
[52:20] to the other side but the balance is
[52:22] right down the middle brothers and
[52:23] sisters we need to be able to Worship in
[52:25] spirit and in truth brother Bram in
[52:28] paragraph 91 he goes on to say a few
[52:30] moments ago I mentioned that John
[52:33] understood what it was to love God that
[52:36] great Apostle of Love would certainly
[52:38] see it when the church began to lose
[52:41] that first love of God 1 John
[52:43] 53 for this is the love of God that we
[52:47] keep his Commandments and I love how
[52:49] brother Bram puts this in there he says
[52:50] his word that's his Commandments right
[52:54] you know we we've heard it said many
[52:55] times before you know want to know what
[52:56] the will of the Lord is what's his will
[52:58] for our life his will is his word keep
[53:01] his word amen that's what it is
[53:04] paragraph 92 one little deviation from
[53:07] that word was a step away from Christ
[53:10] people say they love God they go to
[53:12] church they even shout and rejoice and
[53:14] sing and have a great emotional time but
[53:18] when it's all over watch and see if they
[53:23] are in that word walking in it living in
[53:28] it if they if they go through all the
[53:31] other and then don't walk in that word
[53:34] they can say they love God but their
[53:36] lives tell another
[53:39] story how important is it for us to live
[53:42] this word brothers and sisters amen Our
[53:45] Lives tell another story if we don't
[53:48] live this
[53:49] word we have to have the fruit of the
[53:52] spirit in our lives brother Bram goes on
[53:54] to say I wonder if John didn't see see a
[53:56] lot of that before he died people saying
[53:58] they loved God but not obeying his word
[54:01] oh Ephesian Church something is
[54:03] happening to you someone is trying to
[54:06] either add to that word or take from it
[54:10] but they are doing it so subtly that you
[54:14] can't see
[54:15] it they haven't made a move so big you
[54:19] can't you can see it out there in the
[54:21] open it's under cover and they are
[54:23] bringing it by way of reason and humor
[54:27] understanding and it will take over
[54:29] unless you refuse it go back to
[54:32] Pentecost before it's too late you know
[54:35] I just want to I just want to pause
[54:36] there and just sort of give another
[54:38] commentary on this how important it is
[54:40] for us to recognize that even though
[54:42] we're talking about the Ephesian Church
[54:44] age this is the study on the church ages
[54:46] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[54:48] we talked about where the church age the
[54:50] churches were in Asia Minor this this is
[54:54] the the message to that specific Church
[54:56] but here we are in the seventh Church
[54:58] Age and and we're in the culmination of
[55:01] every single Church age and this is not
[55:04] just exclusive to the Ephesian Church
[55:05] age there's a portion from every single
[55:07] Church age that is applicable to our age
[55:10] every single Church age carries forward
[55:13] and the warnings the information the the
[55:16] the patterns that are set out here are
[55:18] applicable in the oncoming ages from
[55:21] each prior age so this is not just
[55:23] exclusive to the Ephesian Church age
[55:25] brothers and sisters it's very
[55:26] applicable to us in our day one little
[55:29] deviation from the word is a step away
[55:31] from Christ we need to make sure that we
[55:33] know where we stand with
[55:35] this they can say they love God but
[55:37] their lives tell another story and you
[55:40] know this is it's just the way Satan
[55:43] does it it happens so
[55:45] subtly it happens so subtly you can't
[55:48] even see it brother Bram he says in
[55:51] paragraph 93 they haven't made a move so
[55:53] big you can see it out in the open it's
[55:54] under cover and they're bringing by way
[55:56] of reason and human understanding not
[56:00] the leadership of the Holy Ghost human
[56:02] understanding and will take it and it
[56:05] will take over unless you refuse it go
[56:07] back to Pentecost before it's too late
[56:10] paragraph 94 but as usual people don't
[56:13] heed God's warning I say Lord help us to
[56:15] heed his warning go back to our first
[56:18] love he said that Revival fire built
[56:21] upon the sacred word is so wonderful and
[56:24] the manifestation of the spirit so
[56:26] blessed that a little fear Creeps in and
[56:30] a whisper in the heart says how can we
[56:33] protect this truth we
[56:36] have what can we do to see this revival
[56:39] goes
[56:40] on and we know that this happened in
[56:43] Asbury recently and it was news General
[56:47] news out there but it happens in
[56:49] churches did we sing the same song Oh
[56:52] that song that we sang last week man the
[56:54] spirit of God was so strong we want to
[56:56] sing that song again we want to we want
[56:58] to do what we did everything the way we
[57:00] did it because we want to capture that
[57:02] and make it our way so that we can have
[57:04] that Spirit happen no no where the
[57:07] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty
[57:08] and he's going to do what he's going to
[57:10] do how he's going to do it every single
[57:12] time the way he wants to do it we're not
[57:14] going to be able to wave our wand and
[57:16] say we're just going to call on the Holy
[57:17] Spirit you know what that is that's a
[57:19] Pentecostal denomination to say that you
[57:21] know what if the initial evidence is
[57:23] whatever you want could be speaking in
[57:24] tongues it could be discernment could be
[57:26] whatever you want we know the
[57:27] Pentecostals say that it's speaking in
[57:29] tongues but here this is what it is it's
[57:32] all about the word isn't it how can we
[57:35] protect this truth we have we don't have
[57:38] to protect the word of God not one bit
[57:40] the word of God will Pro God will
[57:42] protect his
[57:43] word the word of God is a sword it's
[57:46] sharper than any two-edged sword that
[57:48] any man could prepare th this this word
[57:50] of God doesn't need us to protect it but
[57:53] he says how can we protect the truth we
[57:54] have we have to see this revival goes on
[57:57] paragraph 95 I've got this underlined
[57:59] and balen brother Bram says that is when
[58:02] the Antichrist Spirit comes in and
[58:05] Whispers look you have the truth now see
[58:10] that it doesn't get lost organize and
[58:13] set up your Creed of what you believe
[58:16] put it on a church manual and they do it
[58:19] they organize they add to the word and
[58:22] they die just like Eve did for taking
[58:24] one wrong word
[58:27] it's God's word that brings life and
[58:28] it's not what we say about the word that
[58:31] counts but it's what God Said now you
[58:35] might be saying brother Barry we don't
[58:37] write all this down in a book and put it
[58:39] in a in a in a Creed but brothers and
[58:42] sisters I want to say do we actually not
[58:45] write it in a book but make it our way
[58:48] sometimes and say that unless we worship
[58:50] the way that I'm used to worshiping I'm
[58:52] I'm just not going to worship I'm just
[58:53] not even going to come to song service
[58:56] because it's not the way that I'm used
[58:58] to does that actually stop the spirit of
[59:00] God no way there's no amount of unbelief
[59:04] that will hinder the spirit of God
[59:06] moving not one amount but you know we
[59:09] can easily maybe it's not worship maybe
[59:11] it's the way the preacher is maybe it's
[59:13] the way the deacons are maybe it's the
[59:15] way the babies are in the church
[59:17] brothers and sisters if we don't have
[59:19] babies in the church then pretty soon
[59:20] we're not going to have a
[59:22] church the children are the
[59:25] youth babies are going to cry parents
[59:28] will take them out the spirit of God
[59:30] will go
[59:31] onen if we're focusing on the right
[59:34] things brothers and sisters they're not
[59:35] even going to bother
[59:40] us the warning of God Revelations 2:5
[59:44] remember therefore whence Thou Art
[59:46] fallen and repent and do the first works
[59:50] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[59:51] and remove thy Candlestick out of his
[59:54] place except thou repent
[59:57] I just was in into this and and I just
[59:59] couldn't help but think you know that's
[1:00:01] exactly like a marriage exactly like a
[1:00:03] marriage alls we need to do is remember
[1:00:06] from where we have
[1:00:07] fallen sometimes in our marriage we can
[1:00:09] get so Jaded by life and and and hurts
[1:00:13] and and failures and and things and
[1:00:16] words that happen events in our lives
[1:00:18] but all we got to do is go back and
[1:00:21] repent just repent go back to our first
[1:00:24] love
[1:00:27] but if we don't what will
[1:00:29] happen he says I'll come unto thee and
[1:00:32] will remove that Candlestick out of his
[1:00:34] place except thou
[1:00:36] repent paragraph 96 God tells them to
[1:00:41] remember evidently something had left
[1:00:43] their
[1:00:44] minds they had forgotten
[1:00:47] something sometimes like I said that
[1:00:49] happens in marriage we just forget we
[1:00:51] just forget he told them to turn back in
[1:00:54] their minds to their point of origin the
[1:00:58] origin of the first age was
[1:01:01] Pentecost they had fallen from it they
[1:01:04] had forgotten the glory and wonder of it
[1:01:07] it was time to go back in mind and then
[1:01:11] in
[1:01:12] reality back to when they could say for
[1:01:14] me to live as
[1:01:16] Christ back to Purity when annias and
[1:01:20] saf were dealt with we remember that
[1:01:23] story right ananas and saf
[1:01:27] where they all lived together commonly
[1:01:29] the apostles did the Believers in their
[1:01:31] day and and what happened they said they
[1:01:35] would give their money they would sell
[1:01:36] all their goods and then give it to the
[1:01:38] church and we know many people have
[1:01:40] taken this and exploited it for their
[1:01:42] good but that's not what we're talking
[1:01:44] about I just want to try and highlight
[1:01:45] this story a little bit just to bring it
[1:01:47] to the top of our minds these were
[1:01:50] people that came and lied to the the
[1:01:53] apostles they said you know did you sell
[1:01:55] well they came and brought their money
[1:01:57] the husband and wife they sold their
[1:01:59] property and and the deal was that they
[1:02:01] were going to give everything they had
[1:02:02] and live in common in in a in a
[1:02:06] common commune is what I'm trying to say
[1:02:09] and uh a communal life and everyone was
[1:02:11] on board with it the Holy Spirit was in
[1:02:13] it but they came and and this husband
[1:02:15] and wife said we're going to hold back a
[1:02:17] little bit for ourselves we're just
[1:02:18] going to hold back a little bit for us
[1:02:20] you know they don't need to know
[1:02:21] everything we'll just keep it all just
[1:02:23] hush hush and and we'll give a good
[1:02:25] amount it'll be lots you know it'll be
[1:02:27] fine but what happened in the end the
[1:02:29] the the the the the point that I want to
[1:02:32] get to is they weren't lying to the
[1:02:34] apostles they were lying to the Holy
[1:02:36] Ghost and brothers and sisters if we're
[1:02:38] not careful we can be lying to a brother
[1:02:41] or a sister but are you really lying to
[1:02:44] a brother or a
[1:02:45] sister children are you really lying to
[1:02:49] just your parents when you lie we have
[1:02:52] to make sure that we understand we're
[1:02:53] dealing with the Holy Ghost here and and
[1:02:55] when we're dealing with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:57] here he knows our every thought our
[1:02:59] every move now I I'm not saying this to
[1:03:02] scare children to think they're going to
[1:03:03] drop dead but that's what happened to
[1:03:04] ananas and saf they lied to the Holy
[1:03:07] Ghost and the apostles said to them how
[1:03:09] you know how how do you think you could
[1:03:11] do this do you think this is really
[1:03:13] something to play with brothers and
[1:03:15] sisters this this church that we're a
[1:03:17] part of is not something to play with
[1:03:19] it's not just a traditional form of
[1:03:21] worship this is God almighty this is the
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost we're talking about the same
[1:03:26] God brother Bram is talking about of
[1:03:28] ananas and
[1:03:30] saf that same God is with us even in
[1:03:34] us and because these people died because
[1:03:37] they lied they died dropped dead from
[1:03:40] their lie because they weren't lying to
[1:03:42] just the
[1:03:43] apostles brother Ram he says here for me
[1:03:46] to live as Christ back to Purity when
[1:03:48] ananas and saf were dealt with you can
[1:03:50] imagine everyone in their hearts when
[1:03:52] they heard what happened in that story
[1:03:54] they were saying okay
[1:03:56] I Repent everything that I've got it's
[1:03:58] yours I have nothing in my heart it
[1:04:01] would be kind of like coming and
[1:04:02] standing before a prophet wouldn't it
[1:04:04] someone who could discern your very
[1:04:05] heart you would say I'm not going to
[1:04:07] have any reservations there's nothing
[1:04:09] going to be hidden in my
[1:04:11] life he says back to the gate beautiful
[1:04:14] oh what a reproach it is to drift from
[1:04:16] God and
[1:04:19] countenance and countenance those acts
[1:04:22] that defile his name let those who name
[1:04:25] his name depart from sin and keep their
[1:04:27] vessels pure for God look at what you
[1:04:30] once were in your heart and mind and in
[1:04:33] your
[1:04:33] life and then go back to it and I I just
[1:04:37] want to say you know with that sentence
[1:04:40] right there it's the same thing in a
[1:04:41] marriage just look back to what you once
[1:04:44] were in your heart in your mind in your
[1:04:46] life amen and just go back to it just go
[1:04:49] back to it you don't have to stay in a a
[1:04:52] situation you don't have to stay in a
[1:04:54] state you can just go back to where you
[1:04:56] once loved one
[1:04:59] another paragraph 97 and what is the way
[1:05:03] back the way is the way of
[1:05:08] repentance if a sinner has to come by
[1:05:10] God by way of repentance then the luk
[1:05:13] worm or backslider will have to repent
[1:05:16] that much more repent bring forth fruits
[1:05:20] meet for repentance prove it by your
[1:05:22] life don't just say it if you you do not
[1:05:26] repent said God I will remove your
[1:05:28] lampstand certainly a church in that
[1:05:30] condition can't give light to the world
[1:05:33] its light has turned to Darkness God
[1:05:36] will then take away its faithful
[1:05:38] messenger and its faithful
[1:05:42] Shepherds and leave them to
[1:05:44] themselves and they will go on talking
[1:05:47] about
[1:05:48] Christianity but be bereft of
[1:05:51] it that's
[1:05:54] terrible paragraph 98 repent quickly
[1:05:57] don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did
[1:06:00] hesitate for her lifespan was not very
[1:06:02] long the glory of God decreased ever so
[1:06:05] rapidly it was not long until the city
[1:06:07] was in Ruins its glorious Temple became
[1:06:11] a shapeless Mass the land became a marsh
[1:06:14] inhabited by water foul the population
[1:06:17] was gone except for a few unbelievers in
[1:06:20] a squalled village there was gone except
[1:06:23] for a few unbelievers in a qu sory there
[1:06:27] was not even one Christian left the lamp
[1:06:30] was rent from his place I just can't
[1:06:33] help but think that's a lot like a
[1:06:35] Christian life isn't it just walk away
[1:06:38] from the word walk away from church and
[1:06:41] see how quickly it becomes desolate how
[1:06:44] quickly that life starts to go down the
[1:06:47] drain all manner of evil can take place
[1:06:50] in that life paragraph 99 now it does
[1:06:54] not mean that she could not have her
[1:06:55] repented it does not mean that we cannot
[1:06:58] repent we can but it must be quickly it
[1:07:02] must be a true heart cry to God in
[1:07:06] sorrow and then God will restore amen
[1:07:09] the glory shall come
[1:07:12] again the seed of
[1:07:15] nanism Revelations
[1:07:18] 2:6 this is really what I wanted to
[1:07:20] focus on tonight the seed of
[1:07:23] niotis the deed s of the
[1:07:27] nians revelations 2:6 but this thou Hast
[1:07:30] that thou H hatest the Deeds of the
[1:07:33] nicians which I also hate paragraph 100
[1:07:38] now there are two thoughts on what the
[1:07:39] nicians were it's said by some that they
[1:07:43] were a group of
[1:07:45] apostates who had as their founder
[1:07:47] Nicholas of Antioch a proelite who
[1:07:50] became one of the seven deacons at
[1:07:53] Jerusalem they had Pagan feast and were
[1:07:56] most unchaste in their behavior they
[1:07:59] taught that in order to master
[1:08:02] sensuality one would have to know by
[1:08:04] experience the whole range of it at
[1:08:07] first naturally they gave way to such
[1:08:10] abandon that their degradation was
[1:08:13] complete thus they had applied to them
[1:08:16] the two old testament names that
[1:08:18] symbolized such
[1:08:20] extravagances again brother Bram takes
[1:08:22] it right back to the word balum and
[1:08:26] Jezebel since balam corrupted the people
[1:08:29] and thus conquered them it was said that
[1:08:32] Nicholas did likewise this group was
[1:08:35] supposedly forced out of Ephesus and
[1:08:37] found a place of establishment in
[1:08:39] pergamus but the problem about this
[1:08:42] belief is that it is not true that's a
[1:08:45] problem there is absolutely no history
[1:08:48] for it it is at best tradition to adopt
[1:08:53] such a view would make the church age of
[1:08:55] Ephesus absolutely historical with no
[1:08:58] bearing upon today that is not true for
[1:09:02] whatever starts in the early Church Must
[1:09:05] continue in every age until it is
[1:09:09] finally blessed and exalted by God or
[1:09:12] destroyed as an unclean thing in the
[1:09:14] Lake of Fire that's what I was talking
[1:09:16] about earlier every single Church age
[1:09:18] carries forward it carries
[1:09:20] forward paragraph 102 that is the
[1:09:23] tradition that is actually against
[1:09:25] scripture simply note that in
[1:09:27] Revelations 2:2 the Ephesian Church
[1:09:30] could not bear the evil ones thus they
[1:09:34] had to put them out or it would not make
[1:09:38] sense to say that they could not bear
[1:09:40] them it's just so logical isn't it if
[1:09:43] they did not put them out then they were
[1:09:47] bearing them now in verse six it says
[1:09:49] that they hated their deeds so this
[1:09:52] nickan group remained a part of the
[1:09:55] First Age doing their deeds the Deeds
[1:09:58] were hated but the people were not
[1:10:00] rendered
[1:10:02] impotent thus we see seeds in Ephesus
[1:10:06] that will continue and become a doctrine
[1:10:09] that will go right up to and into the
[1:10:12] Lake of Fire so this he's saying very
[1:10:16] clearly the nickan spirit will continue
[1:10:20] all the way until the end from the very
[1:10:23] first age through every single age right
[1:10:26] up to the very end the nickan spirit to
[1:10:29] conquer the
[1:10:30] leoty paragraph 103 what are these nians
[1:10:34] brother bradam says the word comes from
[1:10:36] two Greek words Nika which means to
[1:10:39] conquer and leas which means the leoty
[1:10:42] in plain fact somebody was doing
[1:10:44] something in that early church which was
[1:10:46] Conquering the leoty if the Le were
[1:10:49] being conquered then it must have been
[1:10:52] some Authority there doing it what was
[1:10:55] it that God hated that was happening in
[1:10:57] that church what was going on then and
[1:11:01] is now going on today is exactly what
[1:11:04] the word nickan means the people were
[1:11:07] being subjected somehow in a way that
[1:11:10] was absolutely contrary to the word of
[1:11:13] God now that sounds like it's
[1:11:16] absolutely Blasphemous right but it can
[1:11:19] be one word off which is absolutely
[1:11:22] contrary to the word of God Amen
[1:11:25] paragraph 105 now to get the real
[1:11:27] meaning of what we are about to go into
[1:11:30] I must caution you to ever keep in mind
[1:11:33] that religion spiritual matters if you
[1:11:35] like is composed of two parts that
[1:11:38] intertwine but are as opposite as black
[1:11:41] and white religion and the spiritual
[1:11:44] world are made up of these two trees
[1:11:48] which had their roots in
[1:11:50] Eden both the tree of life and the tree
[1:11:54] of the knowledge of good and evil stood
[1:11:56] in the midst of the garden and no doubt
[1:11:59] their very branches intertwined each
[1:12:03] other thus in the Ephesian Church it is
[1:12:06] that same Paradox the church is made up
[1:12:09] of good and bad the two Vines make the
[1:12:13] church they are like the wheat and tears
[1:12:17] growing up side by
[1:12:20] side but one is
[1:12:22] true the other is false
[1:12:25] now God will speak to each one and he
[1:12:29] will talk about each one he will call
[1:12:33] them the church and only the elect will
[1:12:37] really know which is the true
[1:12:40] Spirit only the elect will not be
[1:12:43] deceived right amen that is pretty
[1:12:47] powerful right super humbling to think
[1:12:50] that isn't
[1:12:51] it only the elect will not be deceived
[1:12:55] amen hallelujah if we have the ability
[1:12:57] to understand and not be deceived then
[1:12:59] truly you are elect and that means that
[1:13:02] we never chose it he chose
[1:13:06] it and that is just
[1:13:08] unbelievable a paradox unbelievable but
[1:13:13] true Matthew
[1:13:15] 24:24 for there shall arise false
[1:13:18] christs and false prophets and shall
[1:13:20] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:13:24] that if it it were possible they shall
[1:13:27] deceive the very
[1:13:30] elect I just love that verse because it
[1:13:33] shows this isn't just William Mariam
[1:13:35] Bram talking about the elect only the
[1:13:38] elect won't be deceived this is going
[1:13:40] right back to the scripture once again
[1:13:42] right am there is a very elect according
[1:13:46] to the word of
[1:13:47] God paragraph 107 so way back there in
[1:13:51] the early church a very short period
[1:13:53] after Pentecost the false Vine got to
[1:13:57] intertwine itself around the True Vine
[1:14:00] and we find these Deeds of the
[1:14:02] nicotin and that spirit is going to be
[1:14:05] found fighting the True Vine until it is
[1:14:08] destroyed by God now have you got it all
[1:14:12] right now what was the spiritual climate
[1:14:15] of that church it had left its first
[1:14:18] love leaving its first love of the word
[1:14:21] of God was revealed to us by having f
[1:14:25] from its origin which was
[1:14:28] Pentecost in plain English that means
[1:14:31] that this church was in danger of being
[1:14:34] taken away from the leading of the Holy
[1:14:38] Spirit the control of the
[1:14:41] spirit this is why brother brandham
[1:14:43] talked about it just a bit earlier about
[1:14:45] the leadership of man if the leadership
[1:14:48] of man Creeps in and starts to lead then
[1:14:51] what happens is the Holy Ghost pulls
[1:14:53] back and that church is is no longer
[1:14:55] being led by the right
[1:14:58] Spirit paragraph 109 this is exactly
[1:15:01] what took place after Moses LED Israel
[1:15:03] out of Egypt the way of God was to lead
[1:15:07] them by The Cloud of fire prophetic
[1:15:10] utterance Miracles and signs and
[1:15:12] god-given
[1:15:13] wonders this was to be accomplished by
[1:15:16] God selected and God ordained and God
[1:15:19] equipped and God sent men and the whole
[1:15:22] Camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost
[1:15:25] move isn't it interesting well I was
[1:15:27] studying this I just couldn't help but
[1:15:29] think you know when they had come out of
[1:15:31] Egypt come out of bondage all the way
[1:15:33] out they're out in the wilderness now
[1:15:35] they're free and and Moses he gets
[1:15:38] summoned by God to come up to mount Soni
[1:15:42] come to the top and we know that it was
[1:15:44] a a dreadful sight for him that even his
[1:15:47] knees quak he didn't want to go up there
[1:15:49] where the fire in the cloud was that was
[1:15:52] where the children of Israel said you
[1:15:54] know what no we don't want to hear God
[1:15:55] no more let us hear from Moses just talk
[1:15:58] to Moses tell him and then he'll tell us
[1:16:01] and we won't have to be afraid to die
[1:16:03] but isn't it interesting that when Moses
[1:16:05] went up what
[1:16:06] happened Moses he had a right-hand man
[1:16:09] he had a god-given man but he didn't
[1:16:12] have that prophetic leadership and 40
[1:16:16] days after the prophet being away from
[1:16:18] him 40 days after not having that
[1:16:21] leadership what happened that whole Camp
[1:16:24] went crazy
[1:16:26] they went from from from worshiping God
[1:16:29] and celebrating the true signs and
[1:16:31] wonders of of Jehovah God the pillar of
[1:16:34] fire and the cloud the one that was
[1:16:36] leading them just directly right back to
[1:16:39] to to melting down gold and and making
[1:16:42] calves to worship debauchery the whole
[1:16:45] thing 40 days without a prophet goodness
[1:16:49] sakes brothers and sisters if we've got
[1:16:51] a prophetic utterance run to it don't
[1:16:54] ever St from that prophetic
[1:16:57] word
[1:16:58] my they rebelled and wanted a set of
[1:17:01] rules and Creeds to go by now brother
[1:17:03] ban him fast forwards to Samuel they
[1:17:07] rebelled and they wanted a set of rules
[1:17:09] and Creeds to go by they were looking
[1:17:11] around they wanted to be like the world
[1:17:12] we need a king too but they had the King
[1:17:15] of Kings but they needed a king they
[1:17:18] rebelled and set wanted a set of rules
[1:17:21] and Creeds to go by then they wanted a
[1:17:23] king they wanted to be ex exactly like
[1:17:25] the world and went into complete
[1:17:27] apostasy and Oblivion that is exactly
[1:17:30] how the first church age started and it
[1:17:33] will get worse and worse until the holy
[1:17:35] spirit is completely rejected and God
[1:17:37] Must Destroy the people and we know that
[1:17:40] there's a complete blacking out in this
[1:17:42] age that we're living in except for a
[1:17:45] teeny little sliver of light in those
[1:17:47] very elected
[1:17:49] ones
[1:17:50] beautiful paragraph 110 see how it
[1:17:53] started out in the early church it was
[1:17:55] called Deeds then it became a Doctrine
[1:17:58] then it became the
[1:18:00] standard it became the unbending
[1:18:04] way we can get so easily focused on our
[1:18:09] unbending ways can't we brothers and
[1:18:11] sisters we've got to have flexibility we
[1:18:14] got to be like those trees we've heard
[1:18:16] said those trees need to be able to blow
[1:18:18] in the storm and they'll Bend and
[1:18:20] they'll bow and they'll go back and
[1:18:22] forth we got to be willing to be that
[1:18:23] way too if we're not flexible in our
[1:18:26] lives we can have a problem I heard it
[1:18:29] said when we were in Saskatchewan and if
[1:18:30] you're not flexible if you're not
[1:18:31] willing to be flexible in your life with
[1:18:34] things that happen wherever you are
[1:18:36] what's going to happen you're going to
[1:18:37] get bent out of shape that's good you
[1:18:39] got to be
[1:18:42] flexible it finally took over and God
[1:18:44] was pushed aside oh it started so small
[1:18:47] so quietly so
[1:18:50] inoffensively it looked so good and you
[1:18:53] know I'm going to say it this way it
[1:18:54] probably looked so
[1:18:56] organized didn't it it was so orderly
[1:18:59] and clean and tidy it was it was looked
[1:19:02] so good it seemed so good seemed so
[1:19:05] sound then they caught a hold and like a
[1:19:08] python it squeezed out the very breath
[1:19:11] and killed all the spirituality there
[1:19:13] was in the
[1:19:14] church oh that false Vine is subtle it's
[1:19:18] like an angel of Light until it gets a
[1:19:21] hold on you brother bradam he uses that
[1:19:24] that comparison it's like a python if a
[1:19:26] python ever gets it a body around our
[1:19:29] neck we've got a big problem it doesn't
[1:19:31] even need to be around our neck it could
[1:19:32] be just around our chest and start
[1:19:34] squeezing and then we can't breathe
[1:19:36] anymore terrible paragraph 111 now I
[1:19:39] want to say that I believe in leadership
[1:19:43] but it's not the leadership of men that
[1:19:45] I believe in I believe in the leadership
[1:19:48] of the Holy Ghost coming through the
[1:19:51] word and I believe that is what this
[1:19:54] church here Calgary Living Word is built
[1:19:56] on brothers and sisters that is the
[1:19:58] church that I first attended and I could
[1:20:00] see it loud and clear from the first
[1:20:02] sermon that I went to I could see it
[1:20:04] very clearly it wasn't said exactly like
[1:20:06] this I don't think but I could tell that
[1:20:09] this was the spirit of God that was
[1:20:11] leading this church and we want to stay
[1:20:13] exactly like this but it is not the
[1:20:15] leadership of men that I believe in I
[1:20:18] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost coming through the word I believe
[1:20:23] also that God has set men in the church
[1:20:26] men who are gifted by the spirit and
[1:20:29] they will keep the church in order I
[1:20:31] believe that I believe also that the
[1:20:34] church is ruled over by men that God
[1:20:37] sends to take charge amen but that rule
[1:20:42] is by the
[1:20:44] word so that it is not men really ruling
[1:20:48] but the spirit of God yes amen for the
[1:20:51] word and the spirit are one amen the
[1:20:55] moment brother Barry gets off the word
[1:20:58] it's no longer the spirit of God
[1:21:00] brothers and sisters if anybody gets
[1:21:02] behind this sacred desk and preaches
[1:21:04] something other than what's already been
[1:21:06] preached let him be
[1:21:08] accursed Hebrews 137 remember them which
[1:21:12] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:21:14] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:21:16] follow considering the end of their
[1:21:20] conversation paragraph 112 but we see
[1:21:24] what was happening back there that false
[1:21:26] Vine was getting a hold and it was
[1:21:28] teaching that rulership by man was
[1:21:32] right it taught that the church had to
[1:21:35] be
[1:21:37] governed
[1:21:39] governances we have to have things
[1:21:41] written down and sometimes like I said
[1:21:44] we don't even have to write it down we
[1:21:45] can just say this is the way we do it
[1:21:48] yeah does it contribute to the word of
[1:21:51] God it taught a control over the people
[1:21:55] but instead of doing it God's way they
[1:21:57] simply took Authority and vested all the
[1:22:00] spiritual power in their own hands and
[1:22:03] came out with a holy priesthood standing
[1:22:05] between God and the
[1:22:08] people that just is so sad so
[1:22:13] sad you got to get to Christ brothers
[1:22:15] and sisters amen you've got to know him
[1:22:18] in a personal way
[1:22:19] yourselves if there's ever a man that
[1:22:22] says they're the one you know they're
[1:22:25] wrong it's just like saying they know
[1:22:28] when he's going to come it's contrary to
[1:22:30] the word
[1:22:32] then they went right back to the old
[1:22:36] aonic system they became what they
[1:22:40] became Antichrist for they disposed of
[1:22:44] his
[1:22:45] mediatorship and imposed their
[1:22:47] own God hated that the Ephesians hated
[1:22:52] that and any true True Believer will
[1:22:56] hate it too
[1:22:58] amen we would have to be Stone blind not
[1:23:01] to see the same thing at work All
[1:23:03] Through the Ages and right
[1:23:05] now it is the worst of all what it was
[1:23:10] was
[1:23:11] organization that separated the people
[1:23:14] God's people are supposed to be
[1:23:16] one by one Spirit they are all baptized
[1:23:19] into one body and everyone is to be
[1:23:22] moved upon by by the Holy
[1:23:26] Ghost and everyone is to participate in
[1:23:30] the worship of
[1:23:33] God so this is just regular text in this
[1:23:35] book
[1:23:37] here everyone is capitals I love the way
[1:23:41] it's written everyone is to be moved
[1:23:44] upon by the Holy
[1:23:46] Ghost I'm just going to dwell on that
[1:23:48] brothers and sisters it's not optional
[1:23:50] amen it's not one day maybe I'll just
[1:23:53] see if it's going to work maybe you know
[1:23:56] and if it doesn't it's okay I'll just
[1:23:58] carry on no you have to have the Holy
[1:24:00] Ghost or you are not very elect
[1:24:03] hallelujah it's that simple everyone is
[1:24:06] to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:09] everyone is to participate in the
[1:24:12] worship of God
[1:24:14] Amen so to say that I don't like singing
[1:24:18] brothers and sisters if there's anybody
[1:24:20] that doesn't like
[1:24:22] singing that's what we're going to do in
[1:24:24] heaven
[1:24:26] why not practice
[1:24:28] now the word of God says to make a
[1:24:30] Joyful Noise amen does the prophet of
[1:24:34] God even said I hate it when someone
[1:24:36] turns blue holding a note so long like
[1:24:39] they're perfectly trained when we come
[1:24:41] to church we want to Worship in spirit
[1:24:43] and in truth am it's not about
[1:24:46] performing if it's about performing then
[1:24:48] you we've missed the Mark what's
[1:24:51] happening is that organization is
[1:24:53] creeping into our thinking if that's
[1:24:55] what's going on that's the Antichrist
[1:24:57] spirit is what he says in this book
[1:24:59] right here we need to make sure that
[1:25:00] that's not happening because it is like
[1:25:02] a python it will get itself wrapped
[1:25:04] around us and it will get tight and
[1:25:07] Tighter and Tighter and every time we
[1:25:08] breathe out it'll squeeze Tighter and
[1:25:11] pretty soon we won't be able to take
[1:25:12] another
[1:25:14] breath everyone is to be moved upon by
[1:25:18] the Holy Ghost and everyone is to
[1:25:21] participate in the worship of God but
[1:25:24] men wanted the preeminence so they took
[1:25:27] over control and Bishops became
[1:25:30] archbishops and and with imposing titles
[1:25:33] they bypassed the word of God and taught
[1:25:36] their own
[1:25:38] doctrines I just I've heard people say
[1:25:41] that they're the bishop of
[1:25:42] Calgary I I don't
[1:25:45] know there's no Bishop in the word of
[1:25:47] God there's no Bishop in the truly
[1:25:49] elected there's Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:52] yesterday today and forever if we have a
[1:25:54] bishop it's the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:25:56] brothers and sisters yes he says they
[1:25:59] got the people to obey them until the
[1:26:02] time came that their way of worship did
[1:26:06] not in any way at all resemble the early
[1:26:09] days after
[1:26:11] Pentecost these Deeds were beginning of
[1:26:15] apostolic
[1:26:17] succession from Apostolic succession it
[1:26:20] was one easy and quick step to church
[1:26:23] members ship and as the means of Saving
[1:26:27] Grace the word was reduced to a Creed
[1:26:31] Antichrist by his Spirit was
[1:26:34] predominating the church amen now
[1:26:38] remember brother bradam is talking about
[1:26:41] this Antichrist spirit that would creep
[1:26:43] into the church and cause it to be local
[1:26:45] and formal and Powerless it would be
[1:26:47] able to be within the framework of the
[1:26:49] Christian church but we know the truly
[1:26:50] elected is able to discern that and
[1:26:53] withstand
[1:26:54] it but you know we're not talking about
[1:26:58] a a church that's somewhere out in a
[1:27:01] different
[1:27:02] continent somewhere in a different
[1:27:05] denomination those two Vines are
[1:27:07] intertwined brothers and
[1:27:09] sisters the Antichrist Spirit wants to
[1:27:12] get into Calgary Living Word and try and
[1:27:15] organize men the Antichrist Spirit wants
[1:27:18] to get into Calgary Living Word and try
[1:27:21] and mess with us but we need to stay
[1:27:23] with the word hallelujah yes the word
[1:27:27] was reduced to a Creed the Antichrist by
[1:27:30] his Spirit was predominating the church
[1:27:33] that's never going to happen here amen
[1:27:36] we we will not allow that to happen
[1:27:38] here paragraph 114 look at it today and
[1:27:41] if you read acts 2:4 the way some do you
[1:27:44] could read it this way now in the day of
[1:27:46] Pentecost was fully come there came this
[1:27:49] just makes me scratch my head there came
[1:27:51] a priest with a wafer and said stick out
[1:27:53] your tongue he laid the wafer upon it
[1:27:56] then he himself drank some wine and said
[1:27:59] you have now received the Holy
[1:28:01] Ghost man you'd have to call an Uber if
[1:28:04] you had a communion service
[1:28:08] afterwards but I think it's
[1:28:12] real brother Ram in paragraph 115 says
[1:28:15] incredible that is exactly what nanism
[1:28:18] has come to they say never mind what
[1:28:21] God's word says you can't understand it
[1:28:24] all right never mind what God's word
[1:28:27] says you can't understand it we have to
[1:28:29] interpret it for you furthermore the
[1:28:31] Bible is not finished it has to change
[1:28:34] with the times and we will tell you what
[1:28:37] the changes are isn't that convenient
[1:28:40] goodness sakes how contrary that
[1:28:43] contrary that is to the word of God that
[1:28:46] emphatically States let God be true but
[1:28:49] every man a
[1:28:50] liar Whenever there is a conflict with
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:54] truth Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:28:57] but not one word of God will fail so the
[1:29:01] people are led by people who presume to
[1:29:05] be what they are
[1:29:06] not and we know that the Ephesian church
[1:29:10] was able to call them Liars amen they
[1:29:14] say they are Vicor of Christ but what
[1:29:17] they are is
[1:29:19] Antichrist paragraph 116 here is another
[1:29:22] sad story it is the story of water
[1:29:24] baptism in Jesus day and after Pentecost
[1:29:28] they were immersed in water no one can
[1:29:30] deny that educated men say that all they
[1:29:33] did was pour water on them because it
[1:29:35] was easy to find little holes of water
[1:29:38] in many places and when they pour water
[1:29:41] on them they do it in the name of the
[1:29:44] father and the Son and the Holy Ghost as
[1:29:47] if those titles were real names and as
[1:29:51] if there were three Gods instead of just
[1:29:54] one but stay in that organization and
[1:29:57] try and preach the truth of immersion in
[1:30:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:30:02] you will be put out you couldn't be led
[1:30:05] of God and stay in there it's
[1:30:08] impossible you know for the longest time
[1:30:10] I know I've said it a couple times but
[1:30:11] I'll say it now for the longest time I
[1:30:14] thought maybe this was something in the
[1:30:15] past I had never really had the
[1:30:17] conversation with someone who found out
[1:30:20] what I believe really wanted to know
[1:30:21] what I believe so I told him what I
[1:30:23] believe and and he said you know there's
[1:30:25] three persons in the godhead to me and
[1:30:28] and I was kind of like what three
[1:30:32] persons and he said that to me the
[1:30:34] Father the Son the Holy Ghost yeah the
[1:30:36] three persons of the godhead and I I
[1:30:39] thought my goodness it's real and he
[1:30:41] actually
[1:30:43] vly refused the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:46] water baptism with me I I was like
[1:30:49] shocked but it's a real thing I can see
[1:30:53] it L and clear most times it's just
[1:30:56] under the surface but if you ever get
[1:30:58] into that conversation you'll see how
[1:30:59] quickly and the reason for it is it's
[1:31:02] the Antichrist Spirit he don't want to
[1:31:05] give an inch because he knows there's
[1:31:06] power in the name of Jesus
[1:31:09] Christ that's the only Power there
[1:31:13] is my paragraph 117 now Paul was a
[1:31:17] prophet taught by the Holy Ghost if Paul
[1:31:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:22] Christ and said anyone that did
[1:31:24] different from his preaching was a curse
[1:31:26] then it is time to wake up and see that
[1:31:29] the church is no longer controlled by
[1:31:31] the Holy Ghost but is controlled by the
[1:31:34] nicians Acts 20
[1:31:37] 27-30 for I have not shun to declare
[1:31:40] unto you the whole the for for I have
[1:31:44] not shun to declare unto you all the
[1:31:47] counsel of God take heed therefore unto
[1:31:49] yourselves and to all the flock over
[1:31:51] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:31:53] overse ERS to feed the Church of God
[1:31:56] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:31:58] blood for I know this that after my
[1:32:00] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[1:32:03] among you not sparing the flock also of
[1:32:08] your own selves shall men arise speaking
[1:32:11] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:32:14] after
[1:32:16] them just going to leave that alone
[1:32:19] paragraph 18 1118 Paul saw that coming
[1:32:22] but he warned them about this subtle
[1:32:24] priesthood that would come and take over
[1:32:27] with its false doctrines he knew they
[1:32:30] would impl they would Implement a way of
[1:32:33] worship that excluded the people from
[1:32:36] any part in a holy spirit
[1:32:39] Ministry my and even right today among
[1:32:42] those who claim to be free and full of
[1:32:44] the spirit there is not too much freedom
[1:32:47] in the leoty and the best we can see is
[1:32:50] a few preachers with inspired preaching
[1:32:52] while the flock just sits there and
[1:32:54] tries to absorb
[1:32:56] it Lord help us this is a far cry from
[1:33:00] Paul who said that when all came
[1:33:03] together all had the leading of the
[1:33:05] spirit and all participated in spiritual
[1:33:08] worship am paragraph 119 and the church
[1:33:13] corporate has never learned this lesson
[1:33:15] from the scripture nor from history
[1:33:18] every time God gives a visitation of the
[1:33:20] Holy Spirit and the people get free
[1:33:23] after a while
[1:33:24] they bind themselves right back to the
[1:33:26] very thing they came out of when Luther
[1:33:29] came out of Catholicism the people
[1:33:32] stayed free for a while but when he died
[1:33:35] the people Simply Organized what they
[1:33:39] thought he
[1:33:41] believed now I just want to pause there
[1:33:44] for a second brothers and sisters and I
[1:33:45] just want to say this I think it's
[1:33:48] important for us in our day we've got a
[1:33:50] prophet messenger amen have we actually
[1:33:54] done the same thing have the people
[1:33:57] Simply
[1:33:59] Organized what they thought William Mary
[1:34:02] and brandham
[1:34:04] believed that's why I'm so thankful I
[1:34:07] heard it early on coming to church
[1:34:09] brother Ken he said write a list of the
[1:34:11] things you believe take them back to the
[1:34:13] word of God take them back to the
[1:34:15] message of the hour and see if they line
[1:34:17] up and if they don't line up just let
[1:34:19] them go take them off your list because
[1:34:23] they're not right and they will actually
[1:34:25] take us astray amen now I'm not saying
[1:34:29] that everyone has and I'm not saying
[1:34:31] that we have here but I do know this we
[1:34:33] have many people from many different
[1:34:35] areas of the world many different
[1:34:37] different pastors and teachers many
[1:34:40] different ideas and and call it
[1:34:42] theologies brothers and sisters we got
[1:34:45] to have Christ as the central theme of
[1:34:47] our existence don't try and take and
[1:34:50] think about what brother Bram did and
[1:34:53] how he would do things take the word
[1:34:55] that he brought and go live your
[1:35:00] life the people Simply Organized what
[1:35:03] they thought he believed and set up
[1:35:05] their own Creeds and ideas and
[1:35:06] repudiated anyone who said opposite to
[1:35:10] what they
[1:35:11] said so you know I'm thinking as I'm
[1:35:14] saying this I know I'm getting looks
[1:35:15] brothers and sisters I'm not crazy you
[1:35:17] ever seen a legalistic
[1:35:19] Ministry you ever seen people where you
[1:35:21] can't even say Amen in a church
[1:35:24] right that's this this is that yes sir
[1:35:29] they've organized their ideas and made
[1:35:31] their Creeds and created away maybe they
[1:35:33] never wrote it in a book but I guarantee
[1:35:35] you they have a meeting yes sir and they
[1:35:38] talk about it and the families go home
[1:35:41] and implement it with their
[1:35:44] children right yes
[1:35:46] sir they went right back to Catholicism
[1:35:50] with a little different form and right
[1:35:52] today many Lutheran
[1:35:54] are ready to go all the way back oh yes
[1:35:57] in Revelations 12 that old had
[1:36:00] many daughters these daughters are just
[1:36:03] like the mother they set the word aside
[1:36:08] deny the work of the spirit of God
[1:36:10] subjugate the leoty and make it
[1:36:13] impossible for the leoty to worship God
[1:36:15] unless they come through them or through
[1:36:19] their pattern which is nothing but a
[1:36:22] blueprint of unbelief for Satan himself
[1:36:25] amen now brothers and sisters I I
[1:36:27] mentioned it a while ago and and and
[1:36:30] I'll just I think it's good to bring it
[1:36:32] to top of mine Anthony
[1:36:34] Palmer if you haven't heard that name
[1:36:36] for a while think about that name maybe
[1:36:38] look him up on
[1:36:39] YouTube Tony Palmer he went and visited
[1:36:43] The ecumenical council in the United
[1:36:45] States of America in I don't know what
[1:36:47] it was
[1:36:49] 2009 and what he did was he said the
[1:36:51] protest was over
[1:36:54] and so whether the people in the
[1:36:56] denominations and maybe the all of the
[1:36:58] other churches it doesn't matter what
[1:37:00] matters is that every one of the church
[1:37:02] leaders that were in that meeting they
[1:37:05] all fell under the Catholic church right
[1:37:10] because the Catholic Church said to them
[1:37:11] everyone hey you know what Catholic
[1:37:13] means Universal that's what he told them
[1:37:16] and if we're all Christians we're all
[1:37:18] Christlike we're all the
[1:37:20] same did we ever hear that before oh
[1:37:22] yeah nobody stood up in that meeting and
[1:37:25] said I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ nobody said I can't take this I'm
[1:37:30] out of here you're a
[1:37:31] liar you're
[1:37:34] nobody everyone agreed to it everyone
[1:37:37] sat through it and all those that did
[1:37:40] took all of the people under their
[1:37:42] Ministries with
[1:37:44] them whether they want to understand it
[1:37:47] or believe it or not it doesn't matter
[1:37:49] that's the truth of the matter they're
[1:37:52] all under
[1:37:54] Rome the protest is over now it's been
[1:37:58] for a long
[1:38:00] time that day on Calvary amen
[1:38:05] paragraph
[1:38:08] 121 where oh where are we
[1:38:11] spiritually we are in a Wilderness of
[1:38:14] Darkness how far we have wandered from
[1:38:17] the first church Pentecost is nowhere in
[1:38:20] View and the word cannot be found
[1:38:22] apostol succession which today abounds
[1:38:26] is not found in the word it is a manmade
[1:38:32] device it supersedes illegally the truth
[1:38:36] that God not man has set his leaders in
[1:38:41] the
[1:38:41] church Peter was not even in Rome yet
[1:38:45] they lie and say he
[1:38:48] was we were in
[1:38:50] Rome and we
[1:38:52] saw the grave of Peter in St Peter's
[1:38:57] Basilica but here we have the prophet
[1:38:59] saying he's not even there and I
[1:39:02] remember looking at that scratch in my
[1:39:03] head I was pretty early on as a as a
[1:39:05] Christian maybe three or four years as a
[1:39:07] Believer but I remember scratching my
[1:39:10] head saying there's something wrong with
[1:39:11] this I don't know exactly what it is but
[1:39:13] I know the prophet said something about
[1:39:17] this says it right
[1:39:20] here it supersedes illegally the truth
[1:39:22] that God man has set his leaders in the
[1:39:25] church Peter was not even in Rome yet
[1:39:28] they lie and say he was history proves
[1:39:30] he was not there are people who read
[1:39:32] history but shrug their shoulders and go
[1:39:35] back to believing a lie yeah yeah where
[1:39:38] can you find the Vicor of Christ in the
[1:39:41] word no one takes his place and yet it
[1:39:44] has been done and the people accept
[1:39:47] it where can you find that added
[1:39:51] Revelation is accepted by God especially
[1:39:55] Revelation contrary to one already
[1:39:59] given yet they accept it and rest on it
[1:40:03] where do you find a
[1:40:05] Purgatory where do you find a
[1:40:09] mass excuse
[1:40:11] me where do you find paying money to get
[1:40:14] out of
[1:40:15] hell it's not in the word but men put it
[1:40:20] in their own
[1:40:21] book and by it took over the people
[1:40:25] ruling them by fear I'll call the
[1:40:27] musicians as we close
[1:40:29] here where do you find that man has the
[1:40:33] power to forgive us as though he were
[1:40:37] God Grievious wolves is hardly strong
[1:40:41] enough to describe them
[1:40:44] nianis
[1:40:47] organization man over
[1:40:50] man he says get back to God
[1:40:54] repent before it's too
[1:40:56] late see the handwriting on the
[1:40:59] wall it is writing
[1:41:01] judgment as the sacred vessels were
[1:41:04] desecrated and thus brought the wrath of
[1:41:07] God now the sacred word has been
[1:41:10] desecrated and the spirit grieved and
[1:41:13] judgment is here even at the door repent
