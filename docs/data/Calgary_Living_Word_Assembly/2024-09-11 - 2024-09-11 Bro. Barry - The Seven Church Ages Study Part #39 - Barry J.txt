Lord we're truly humbled and honored father to know that we're standing in your presence Lord yes Lord father this week it just became so clear to me so thankful Lord for your Tender Mercies amen yes Lord if we ever wanted to have an opportunity to speak to the prime minister of Canada we would probably never get that chance if we wanted to speak to someone very important in this world it could be iffy but Lord Jesus we can go on our knees and speak directly to the creator of this universe thank you Lord and Lord to think that you hear us yes amen and to think that you're concerned about us Lord yes amen and father you're just waiting for us to wait upon you Lord Jesus instead of trying to act out and live according to this world and try and make things happen the way that we think they should Lord how vital it is that we wait upon you Lord Jesus because we know that you will bear us up yes Father tonight we thank you for the the praise report of sister Amber Lord we know that you are more than able and we're so thankful father we pray that you would continue to lead her and guide her father that you would just keep your angels encamped about her father Lord Lord that she could be a walking testimony of your grace in this age amen thank you for her family Lord and all of the people in her life that are special and dear to her father we pray that you would just allow her Lord Jesus to show them that you are a living God that you are the same yesterday today and forever that you are The Great I Am Lord we love you and we thank you for that testimony yes Lord we want to commit the two requests unspoken father once again just bring them top of mind and thank you for meeting those needs Lord sovereignly father Lord Jesus we pray for the Odin noos that that you would

who aren't here tonight father for whatever reason we know that you know where they are and father we pray that you would just encourage them Father just a little more a little extra tonight father if some are traveling if some are working father maybe some are just out of sorts in their heart or in their mind father we know that you're more than able and that you're fully aware of each and every need we just commit them all unto you into your hands father For Your Glory we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians thank you sisters for the special amen certainly sets a wonderful atmosphere you have your Bibles tonight we'll continue on in our study the exposition of the seven Church agesen finishing off the pergami and church age we'll read from Revelations chapter 2 we'll start with verse 12 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he amen which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where an Antipas was my faithful martyr sorry but I have a few things things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught BAC to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana amen and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word Lord we're so thankful that you gave us an opportunity to hear your word amen we know that you know exactly where we are and what we're going through father and Lord you've given us an ear to hear your word you haven't given us ears father it's not plural it's a singularity of a single word and we thank you for that ear Lord we just pray that that ear could become Keen tonight father that Lord we would be able to dial in and hear what your spirit has to say one more time we love you and we thank you we just commit all things now into your hands as we go forwards in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen amen God bless you tonight you may have your seats I uh just want to welcome the Connecticut connection once again not the entire Gibbs family but sister cot no sister Grace's mom uh God bless you welcome certainly thankful to be back in the house of the Lord tonight amen just a few announcements we have the Youth Event on the 15th I believe that's already halfway through September this Sunday it'll be at our house and uh we're certainly excited about that we have a communion service coming up on the 22nd and that will be at 5:30 p.m. so that we can hopefully get everyone home at a decent time so that the children can get ready for school are you happy tonight the uh odinos have gone back home they're probably getting on the plane right about now and uh so we know their families took them to the airport tonight and we're certainly thankful for the time we had to visit and fellowship and the influence that they have had on their children they're an absolute blessing tonight we're going to carry on and uh we will definitely finish off the uh pergami and church age Lord willing and I just think it's amazing you know I I think this is uh number 39 of the uh of the study service number 39 of the study and I just made a note here when we started this and it was October 4th 2023 when we started and we are just just halfway through now so I think it's a a wonderful thing there's so much in here um this is basically the the message of the hour in essence aside from the lives that we live we can quote a bunch of quotes and we can talk about what the prophet did in his day but who are we today what life are we living H how do would people the closest to us describe our lives and I think that's probably the the Keystone of really what the message is it's not a histor history it's not a historical book even though we can uh look at it many times and there's lots of History that's discussed in it but uh we're talking about a living word that's what this this church assembly is called a Living Word assembly and and uh you know if it's not a Living Word then we're just simply wasting our time brother Branham said we're just a lodge then at that point we just get together and have a wonderful time of Fellowship but it has to be Jesus Christ alive inside of us amen tonight we're going to pick up from where we left off on the rewards um I just had one one quote that I wanted to bring from here um the last time I I brought a whole bunch of uh notable quotes from the last um chapter that we were into um I believe it was the saman church age this time I'm only going to bring one and and there's so much in here this is the second longest Church age out of all the church ages the very next one the thot tyan Church age is the longest one and we know that was over the the span of the Dark Ages but uh I think it was just about 900 years but but uh you know out of this one the pergami and church age do you want to look this up brother just type in there it is you can't claim there it is you can't claim I I just want to take a little bit of time and and bring this forward here tonight because I think this is probably for me the most notable out of this church Age and and there's a lot in here I'm not saying that others aren't notable but I just don't really want to take too much time dwelling upon it it's uh and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled no sir I'm repeating it because I want the brothers to bring it up and I I apologize I'm pitching a curveball it might even be a screw ball if you know baseball you got her all right and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled no sir I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit filled even though even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live there was people in jesus' day that accepted Jesus they might not have understood him but they accepted him and they followed them yes sir and there was people that didn't it was one or the other that's right it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word The Works would follow that is the Bible now I'm saying this I'm hovering here for a minute because I want to let it soak I just want to dwell here for a minute because we can say that we've got the manifestations in our life we can say that we hear the word but what do the two come together in our life do we have the word cause manifestation or do we just simply have the word and some other manifestation or do we just have a manifestation without the word right what do we have in our life the prophet of God is saying here you got to have both it's not optional to claim one and not have the other means that something is a miss something is off the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is the same as it was back in the day of our lord it's receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live remember when the disciples were empowered by the Lord he sent them out with power right go two by two and they came back and they were having a rejoicing time they were on fire for the Lord they had some tremendous meetings healing campaigns Devils being cast out success in the word but what did Jesus say to them don't don't Rejoice because devils are subject to you rejoice because your name is written in heaven and I wrote it there can you imagine that my Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the true word if they truly got baptized with the Holy Ghost those signs and wonders would follow after them amen now Jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergami and age which was yet 200 years off from the patmas vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God right amen so if we have one substitute one substitute one tradition one teaching one something that's different than that word we've left God why if you leave that word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive that word am now this is what I wanted to get to brothers and sisters this sentence here I'm framing it that far back and I'm going to go a little further forward but this sentence right here don't let anyone or anything get between you and that word how easy it can happen it's treacherous in the age in which we live the devil wants to get anything he can in our way to get us off the word right anything am say it again don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word hallelujah remember that who is speaking there I just have to say that who is speaking there was this just a man was this just William bradam I just was listening to questions and answers over and over and over and uh you know he says someone says are you the son of man he says no I am a son of man he was the son of man amen he was the god Prophet amen I am a prophet amen my yes the next sentence I'll never forget my pastor teaching me this I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst cuz brothers and sisters don't look for some great Revival to happen this is it manen are we sufficiently impressed with the word right here in our midst right I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus' name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1 John 5:14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that he we have the petitions that we desire of him now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Lamentations 3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God and the word they are one I think that's so beautiful that's the most notable for me out of this paman church age I think it's so important but brothers and sisters don't ever this is man or Prophet or God speaking through the man Prophet don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word myen talking about the rewards out of uh the pergami and church age here in Revelations chapter 2 Revelations 2 verse 17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it brother bradam speaking here he says each message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer and isn't this just the way the word the the the Lord the word our heavenly father is encouraging him to be an overcomer not slapping them to be an overcomer not pushing them through the pipe to be an overcomer but encouraging them encouraging them to be an overcomer and thereby rewarded of the Lord in this age the spirit is promising the hidden mana and a new name written in a white stone amen now since each of these messages is directed to the angel human messenger a very great responsibility as well as a wonderful privilege is his lot to these men God makes special promises as in the case of the twel Apostles sitting on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel then remember Paul was given a special promise that of presenting the people of the Bride in his day to Jesus my 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste amen virgin to Christ I could just take and and probably maybe even on Sunday preach an entire sermon on that one verse because you know what if we're going to be a virgin to Christ we're going to be a virgin to the word if we're going to be a virgin to the word there ain't no room for word worldly junk in our lives brothers and sisters he is not going to play second fiddle to anything Amen to anything and and I think we probably will get into that maybe on Sunday Lord willing paragraph 231 so it will be with every messenger who has been faithful to the word of his hour and his age it will be so in the last day it will be the same special reward that was given to Paul I think most of you remember how I said I had always been afraid to die lest I should meet the Lord and he should not be pleased with me as I have failed him so many times been a little bible study and uh we're going through the church ages and it's actually interesting because it's way back we're right at the very beginning of the exposition of the seven Church ages and you know uh part of the discussion last night came up and it was on the thought of uh fatalism and and how we can just come to a place where we'll say you know what if if we die well it's God's plan and and I'm just going to die it's just going to happen and and doesn't matter you know there's no point to even trying what we do it's just God's Will and and the universe is just going to take over and and I don't have any choice in the matter and you know sometimes we don't have any choice in the matter but we have a choice in how we conduct ourselves in the matter and that's the Difference Maker I thought it was such a rich thought that came out of there I just think it's so good to look at this and think that we could say maybe we could go and meet God and and not be ready we have the profit for our age saying that it makes me wonder Lord do I need to do some work on myself maybe I need to do a little more study on the inward Parts it it would be a fearful thing truly to go and and and know that you're going to meet God but what an amazing thing as a Believer to think that you know what one day that's going to happen and we can have confidence that we know where we're going to go amen For Better or For Worse not making Grace a disgrace and saying I I know I'm going to die someday anyway and I believe the message of the hour so I could just go and live any old way I want and God's going to sort it out if I'm truly elected then I'll never be lost right if we're truly elected we'll never have that attitude right amen brother bam goes on to say well I had been thinking of that one morning as I lay in bed and suddenly I was caught up in a most peculiar Vision I say it was a PE was peculiar for I have had thousands of visions and not once did I seem to leave my body but there I was caught up and I looked back to see my wife and I saw my body laying there beside her then I found myself in the most beautiful place I have ever seen it was of paradise I saw throngs of the most beautiful people and happiest people I have ever seen they all looked so young about 18 to 21 years of age there was not a gray hair or a wrinkle or any deformity amongst them the young women all had their hair down to their waist and the young men were so handsome and strong isn't that beautiful we can look at this and say wow this is you know brother bradam he's got this this this Vision that he says that he had but you know remember we'll see that that he says it in here that he preached what Paul preached yeah that's what we believe we don't believe that brother brandham brought a new message that's outside of the word of God he he preached what Paul preached and we're resting on that that's what we said to him in this Vision here but if you'll turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 I just think it really Bears uh it's important to just make sure that we're not we're not just making this stuff up this isn't just something that's drummed up and and we call it the message and and whatever and it sounds good it's important to recognize there's a scriptural identity to what this man's talking about here he he he said that he was caught up and he saw his body lying there in 2 Corinthians 12: 1 to 4 we have Paul speaking here and it's called Paul's vision is the footnote in my Bible it's not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven right and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is it is not lawful for a man to utter so here we have Paul going into a vision now some people might say well he he's just replicating what Paul did and so you can tie the Loose Ends back together I know how the devil works we know how that's the devil will work how how theologians will try and say that we're just making this up but there's some interesting things in this Vision that actually separates it from maybe what theologians would try and Scorn this to be brother bradam in paragraph 234 he goes on to say oh how they welcomed me they hugged me and called me their darling brother and kept telling me how glad they were to see me as I wondered who all those folks were one beside me said they are your people now remember this is a man that wasn't looking for accolades he was never one time looking for offerings he was never one time looking to be promoted he would rather just step aside and let somebody else shine that was who he was but yet all these people were announcing him and and and thanking him and and not praising him but welcoming him yes sir he says I was so astonished I asked are all these Brams he said no they are your converts amen he then pointed to one lady and said see that young lady that you were admiring a moment ago right she was 90 years old when you won her to the Lord amen I said oh I and to think that this is what I was afraid of just makes me think of Brother Gary Walker's testimony remember what he said one day we'll look back and say it was all worth it every single trial every single pain every single problem every issue we'll look back and say it was worth it all the man said we're resting here while waiting for the coming of the Lord I replied I want to see him he said you can't see him just yet but he's coming soon and when he does he will come for you first and you will be judged according to the gospel you have preached and we will be your subjects yes sir how many of his subjects do we have here tonight I just I just highlighted that and we will be your subjects I said do you mean I'm responsible for all these he said everyone you were born a leader I asked him will every one be responsible what about St Paul he answered me he will be responsible for his day right I think it's so amazing to look at this and say there's all the different days you know we can look back and say there's wonderful things from Paul's day and wonderful things from irania day wonderful things from Columbus Day and all the different days but you know what brothers and sisters we're going to be responsible for all of those days all of them are a culmination to the age in which we live and that is where we live that's where we stand he answered me he will be responsible for his day well I said I've preached the same gospel Paul preached and multitude cried were resting on that amen and I can't help but think brothers and sisters because he was not in a natural place he was in an eternal place we were all right there with him we were all there saying that to him yes I can see that God is going to give a special reward to his Messengers who have Faithfully discharge the responsibility he has placed upon them and that's true I'm sure we all agree upon that if they have received the revelation of the word for that age and Faithfully preached in their day and lived what they preached They will receive a great reward amen yes that's wonderful thing to look at but how does that apply to us I can't help but think let's just turn over to Matthew chapter 10 we still have some time tonight amen Matthew chapter 10 Matthew chap 10 verse 41 very familiar scripture but sometimes it just Bears record we need to remind ourselves of these things here we have them talking about the messengers of the ages and how they're going to receive a great reward but brothers and sisters it's not just for him it's not just for them he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward all we have to do is receive the prophet amen and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and we know the the very next scripture and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward some of the littlest things that we could ever do are going to have some of the greatest rewards on the other side what I want to point out here brothers and sisters is don't push this off and make it just for the prophet Just For The Messengers just for the age Messengers take it and make it yours take it and Own It know that it's our reward we are going to get the same reward because we believe the same word that he brought carrying on he says now with this thought in mind look at the verse again I will give him the hidden Mana we all know the Mana was angel food it was what God sent down upon the grass for Israel at the time of their wanderings it was perfect food it was a amazing how those little pellets of food kept them in perfect health no one got sick it was all they needed when the ark was made they put some of that Mana into it then the ark was put behind the veil and only the high priest would dare approach unto it unto I and then he had sorry approach unto I and then he had to have the sacrificial blood the bread from Heaven symbolized by Mana one day came down from heaven and became life for all who believe on him amen he said I am the bread of life I am the living bread that came down from heaven If any man shall eat of this bread he shall live forever John 648 and 51 let's turn over to Luke 10 Luke 10 verse 23 and 24 four this Mana that came down from heaven fed the children of Israel and we know they had it there to sustain them and it was perfect food it was angel food brother Bram goes into talking about it here but it's interesting because the human response to it was what is it and that's the definition one of the definitions of Mana what what is this and and they got sick of it they got bored of it and and that's where I can't help but think about that that quote that we read a little bit earlier tonight are we sufficiently impressed with the word because this hidden Mana is really what we're talking about when we talk about this word this is hidden Mana this is stuff that people desired to see once upon a time but weren't able to but here we are it's just natural it's just normal in Luke 10 verse 23 and he turned unto his disciples and he said privately he didn't say it publicly did he blessed are your eyes which see the things that ye see yes for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see yes and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them but here we are we have this hidden Mana it's just given to us freely and uh it's because we have an ear because we have the seed Gene of God in us when this word comes by our way it quickens that seed Gene of God and and it comes to life we can't help that but I just think it's amazing to look at this these little pellets of food every time that we read the word every time that we listen to a message every time we come to church brothers and sisters there are little pellets of food and sometimes they can actually seem to be a little boring and maybe a little bit old but I think we heard it well and clear on Sunday if we're willing to come prepared for service these little pellets of food can give us sustenance like we've never even imagined these little pellets of food kept them in perfect health they will keep us in perfect health and it says here no one got sick you know we're not talking about our physical body sometimes we will get sick I just feel like preaching now but you know brothers and sisters don't worry about our physical bodies it has to perish we will see Deliverance of these physical bodies bodes but worry about spiritual sick there are so many spiritual viruses going around now it is unreal we talk about the the natural viruses in this world I would say don't worry so much about the natural viruses people might take this and make it out of context by a recording and that's okay they can but just make sure you put this part in we're talking about spiritual viruses the kind of thing that can get in you and you have a real hard time getting out the only way that you can get a virus out of you is for your body to actually outgrow it it has to run its course you can have a vaccine or some antibodies put in you some sort of medication but that virus is not just going to leave like some sort of an illness some sort of organism that could get into you but we have spiritual viruses and if we're not careful it will take away our ability to see these little pellets of food keeping us in perfect health keeping us from getting spiritually sick but here we have brother badam saying it was all the children of Israel needed when the ark was made they put some of that Mana into it when then the ark was put behind the veil and only the high priest would dare approach unto I and then he had to have the sacrificial blood the bread from Heaven symbolized by Mana one day came down from heaven and became the life for all who believe on him we've read these scriptures here I am the bread of life I am the living bread that came down from heaven If any man shall eat of this bread he shall live forever John 6:48 to 51 when he went away he left us his word man shall not live by bread alone by all of the natural sustenance in this world but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God I just can't help but think about the the prophet Micaiah and and the story who's going to get my word to come to pass in the life of of Ahab the story of him go the god sitting on the throne and and we know that there was all kinds of spirits coming up with different ideas but one Spirit came and and knelt down before the throne the word of God says and says I'll go and deal with them and how is he going to deal with them he was going to go and be a religious spirit a lying religious spirit and God said okay go brothers and sisters don't think that it was just for that day we know the L lid of hell has been torn off and all of these Spirits are manifesting now don't worry about the natural sustenance so much as the spiritual my his word was bread it was the perfect Mana which if a man live by he shall never die some people might say but brother bury in this flesh we die yeah we will all of our fleshes they have to perish and what a wonderful thing it is I think about this guy here and I would much much rather lay this flesh down and have a eternal life then take this guy with me and be struggling with him forever we're not talking about this flesh Never Dying we're talking about our souls Never Dying brother bam says right after the death of the fathers no one seemed to know the exact truth and in a short while this Mana seemed to have become hidden to the people but in every age God began to give back by Revelation that which was hidden until this last day according to revelation 10:7 a prophet will come and reveal all the Mysteries and then the Lord will come but we know Revelations 101:7 there's still an 8 to13 take the book and eat it up amen and it will be sweet as honey in your mouth but it'll make your mouth your belly bitter your flesh won't be able to handle these little pellets of food because the little pellets of food aren't for this flesh they're for our souls the brandom says now in each age I say The Messengers receiv received hidden truth but they don't did not receive it for themselves only but it is as it was when the disciples were asked to serve the multitudes Loaves and Fishes Jesus gave them the broken food but they in turn gave it to the people right can you imagine the disciples in that story I just was thinking about it myself can you imagine the disciples taking that food and actually hybridizing it just pinching a little bit maybe and putting it in their pocket and thinking I'm just going to get my own little bit of each one of these foods and maybe I'm going to put a little bit of salt on this one here because you know maybe it just needs a little bit of a a spin on it could you imagine if they started doing that to that food that's what ministers do with this word that's right God gives his hidden Mana to the Overcomer it cannot be otherwise he would not open his treasures to those who spurn what is already revealed that's so beautiful what I have been saying about the messenger of each age receiving from God some of the original truth of Pentecost is typed out in the Old Testament where Moses commanded to take up three and 1 half pints of mana and place it in the golden vessel behind the veil of the holy of holies there the priest of every generation could enter with sacrificial blood then he could take a small portion of his this Mana for it did not corrupt which was part of the original and eat it can you imagine that it would just never corrupt he is the same yesterday today and forever this word purely will never corrupt but there's people that will try and make it something else which will corrupt we know that Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits just let them go just see what happens I'm the vine ye are the branches and every single branch that produces fruit will be purged and everyone that does will be heu down and cast into the fire I just can't help but think here we've been given the the the story he mentions the story about how Moses was commanded to to go in there and and the high priest once a year he was the only one that was able to go in and actually see this hidden Mana see these little pellets of food that sustained the people but you know nowadays we are commanded to go in there as well and to actually stay out of of that inner Veil means death to us once upon a time if we went in there it meant death to us nowadays to stay out of there means death thank now in every age the messenger of the Lord to that age was given the revelation of God for that specific period once the messenger was enlightened by truth he would bring that truth to the people and they whose ears ear had been opened by the spirit would hear that truth believe it and go home and live it and live it just believing it ain't enough right saying I believe is the start it's just like getting the Holy Ghost when we get the Holy Ghost in our life that's just the start the overcoming power is going to overwhelm us for the amount of battles that that will go through Hallelujah because the battles are going to come there's no way around that the battles will come the devil's going to rage he is going to come and test us all the way to the end whether we go in the sky or we go in the grave he's going to test us every single day of Our Lives there's no way around that but the proof is whether we actually get mad and go home and say there's nothing to it I sered God all these years and he just didn't answer my prayers the way that I think that he should maybe I just didn't try transform into some other being like I thought maybe I should maybe someone was supposed to be a certain way and they just never were all these different things the devil's going to come around and try and make us think but it's all lies because the only thing that counts is our ability to receive the word to say Amen to the word and when we say Amen to the word they whose ears had been opened by the spirit would hear that truth believe it and live it amen right and it comes to the place we've talked about it where it's not our faith any longer it's the end of our faith the end of our faith is when we get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters that's when that spirit that we hear that's opened our ears that's quickened to us that truth that we believe it begins to live through us thank you Lord and and that's really the the tricky part many times we see so many people living the word going out there living the word and maybe they're good at the message of the hour and they know lots of quotes and and the the word word gets us excited and we can say that we've got 10 year in the message of the hour but can we live it that's the key that's the critical Factor what do the people closest to us say about us do they say we live it but Bram goes on to say now then there is also the thought of the future partaking of the Hidden Mana I love it because there's a time where there's going to be a future partaking of it and I say I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I think it will be the Eternal partaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Eternal ages to come how else could we begin to know the unsearchable riches of his own being right all that we have longed to know all are unanswered questions all that will be revealed amen it just brings a rest to know that that's really what we're going to it will come from Christ who is our life that we receive it oh sometimes we think we get to know a little of him and his word down here and it's so good it makes us rejoice but one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we had never dreamed Possible Oh Lord hasten that day my It also says here that he's going to give the Overcomer a white stone and in not on the stone a new name just makes me think of Junior Jackson's dream everybody familiar with Junior Jackson's dream he said brother branam got this this crowbar this this bar iron bar looking thing and it it happened and they were all looking at this pyramid this Stone and brother Bram came and cracked it open with this this this metal thing I can't help but think it wasn't a crowbar it was a sword a sword of the king allowed him to open that rock of Revelation and what did he do he told them look on this and what did he do he went out west and all of that is just so good it's it's wonderful because we can see that it's already fulfilled it's already happened but that white stone with with a name written in it not on it look on this brothers and sisters we need to become this word this is that stone that we need to look upon so beautiful my It also says here that he's going to give the Overcomer a white stone and in not on the Stone a new name I just can't help but think it's so beautiful it's not going to be whitewashed hey we're not going to be whitewashed we're not going to have our name on the outside not a badge to say that I believe the message of the hour I've got Jesus Christ the say yesterday say I got the Holy Ghost right here no it's going to be the life that's being lived because it's inside of us it's in the stone the new name which the owner alone knows that's why nobody can ever talk you out of it once you truly get saved once you truly become baptized with the Holy Ghost in your life nobody's ever going to talk you out of it doesn't matter nothing will come between you and that word ever amen doesn't mean there won't be trials there will be trials there will be tribulations but we'll always be able to come back to the word amen now the idea of a new name is familiar one Abram was changed to Abraham Sarai to Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter and Saul to Paul these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change it was only after Abram and Sarai had their names Changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son in Jacob's case he had to overcome and then he was called a prince in the case of Simon and Saul when they had received the Lord their change came and today brothers and sisters today each one of us as true believers has had a change in name amen we are Christians and it's not the general Christians out there where we can say we're we're we're like the Catholic Universal no there's a lot of people that claim this claim but very few of them can stay with the word amen we are Christians it is a name common to all of us but one day we will have another change we will of a certainty receive a new name it could well be that name was our true and original name written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world he knows the name but we do not one day at his good pleasure we will also know yes we will know also a white stone how beautiful here is another picture of the saint receiving recompense for the hand of God for his trials upon the Earth you know after Constantine the false church was able to dip its hand into the State Treasury and thereby erect beautiful buildings full of lovely statuary these statues made of White marble were actually Roman Idols renamed as Saints the churches and their Furnishings were exceptionally beautiful even as one sees today but God was not with them if anybody has ever been to Rome the Vatican City if you stand in St Peter's Square on top of the the Basilica I think it's called there's statues of all of the Saints all around it's it's actually stunning how incredibly large it is the architecture is astounding but God's not there yes sir where was God he says he was with his Saints in some little home or in a cave or some wild mountain area where they hid from false church members they weren't hiding from the enemy government they weren't hiding from the military they were hiding from false church members you know I just this makes me think about brother bradam and and the story of thy house in Tipton Georgia and uh you know in that little house meeting just a few people they had a house recorder there and they were able to record it just could you imagine sitting around with a prophet and having him just having a church meeting in our house what he said to the people there I think is astounding he said you know the secret to my Ministry the secret to my Ministry is this when the angel came to me me and gave me my commission I believed them I just believed them and I can't help but think brothers and sisters when we listen to this message of the hour when we receive this message of the hour every single time there's something new we've heard it over and over we could listen to the same message over and over and always get something new out of it every single time that happens all we have to do is believe him that's all we just have to believe it and what happens is it changes us on the inside out my they did not have beautiful buildings gown choirs fine clothes and other worldly attractions but now in this special promise to the True Believers of all ages God has declared he will give them rewards of great Beauty and eternal duration amen he says let the wealthy look down on the poor let them give large sums to the church that in turn might honor the donor by by placing a marble plaque or some statuary in their honor on public display that all may applaud I was just thinking about this the other day actually this very thing not in the church but outside where you see in memory of and and so and so and you see a name on a park bench and and I think my is that as far as it goes where people give their money and and they just have a plaque in their name how sad he goes on to say someday the God who sees and knows all will once more commend the Widow for giving her all though it be but two mites and he himself will reward with the treasures of Heaven yes hidden mana and a new name in a white stone how good is the Lord to us to reward us so wonderfully am amen and we so undeserving oh I want to be ready at all times to do his will and to lay up Treasures in Heaven amen God bless you tonight I'll call the musicians next Wednesday we'll begin the tharan age it's the longest age 1606 to 1520 and I think it's one of the most fascinating ages the stories in here that brother Bram talks about are uh amazing you know the other interesting thing is even though it's the longest of Ages it's not as many pages as the pergan church age it's actually quite small in comparison to before we go into maybe stand with me as we close tonight before we go into uh the next Church age I just I just want to read this for those people who maybe don't know um haven't heard it sometimes it's good just to have a refresher amen but the purpose of this message of the hour through the lens of the Prophet his words to the church at the very end of the seven Church ages this is in the resume of the ages it's the last three paragraphs of the book he says so we conclude the seven Church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only in teaching us truths of the ages but he has been Faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him now brother Bram he says in adoption that preaching saves people and teaching positionally places them we have to learn these things and that's why we're going through this book word by word paragraph 75 says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or organization I have never done that and will not do that now but we can all look around and saywell there's a lot of people that have done that that's not what he was intending there's a lot of people that have a lot of horror stories terrible things that they would say is related to this message of the hour but that's not what this Prophet actually intended that's not what he was promoting other people took it and promoted their own agendas not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me join my church or start some fellowship an organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people amen and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men yes wherein men become New Creation in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him may God bless you and may his coming Rejoice amen your heart let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this message that you've given us Lord the exposition of the seven Church ages Lord explaining to us how your word has come down through all of the ages and father we know that your Prophet had a desire in his heart to come and preach a six-hour service at the end of his life he was on the road to do it when you saw fit to take him home he was on the road to come and preach the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end knowing that you can see the trail of the serpent through all of the church ages right from the beginning all the way up to the end father we're so thankful we can see that blessed are our eyes for we see the things of God and and blessed are our ears for we can hear the things Lord Jesus that many kings and Prophets Desir to hear desire to look upon and and we can just
