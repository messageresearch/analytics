another privilege another opportunity to together in his presence this morning on a rather cold winter morning but then again whenever there is such a reason we just have to remember that there are people who have a desire to meet the Lord or to gather but they cannot in certain parts of the world right now so let's always be mindful of that um I was texting with the pastor this morning and actually yester night as well and it seems the Lord has blessed their trip and so he's there on their way I expect them to be on their way here so let's just continue to keep them in prayer till they get there because the roads are not very um the safest of of of things at the same time let's continue to remember brother Toby then just the work they're doing in Lethbridge it's it's it's very important that the Lord touches that last person right amen um there isn't much of an well brother mvin next week please remember brother mvin uh there is a praise report and welcome brother Daniel and sister Christie so brother Daniel and sister chrisy Jin thanking God for Journey Mercies granted to us as we travel we traveled back to Nigeria may his name be praised amen and um I think yes there's a prayer request as well for brother Asher snow sick with a bad cat so let's uh bring all of this before the Lord and if you have a a request you may also indicate it by the raising of an AR let's let's get up because we'll go into the word right away but let's pray precious Lord Merciful Savior this is your church Lord Lord and this is your service and we are your people precious Lord but all our effort will be in vain without your enabling hand yes and that is why we surrender to you this morning and we invite you to take control of the service every aspect of it precious Lord may it be pleasing to you oh dear lord and father we thank you Merciful Savior for leading our brother and sister to Nigeria and bringing them back home safely it is only by your grace it is only by your mercy precious Lord we pray that you continue to be with the people who are not here with us our brother Toby is not here father may you anoint him and use him amen father I pray that you be with our pastor and bring him home safely oh Lord everything that we do we just want to make sure we're doing it to your glory oh Lord so may your name be praised in every aspect of what we do but father we know as well that this house you intended it for it to be a house of Praise a house of worship a house of your word a house of all that but father life flows from this house and healing flow flows from this house and that is why we pray for our brother Asher you know where he is you know what is going on we invite you to intervene in that situation oh Lord that father we will see him and give you the glory at this juncture precious savior we just yield ourselves to you have your way do as you please make it sensitive to your word as it goes forth and bless the speaker as well as the hearer in Jesus Christ's name do we pray amen amen all right so once we are on our knees let's just go straight into the word just making sure I've not forgotten anything all right let's open our Bibles to First John 2:15 take about three verses in first John and then we'll go to Joshua 7 Hallelujah first John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the last there of but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen let's read Joshua 7 this is a bit of a long read all right Joshua 7 but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the Cur thing for aan the son of K the son of zapi the son of Zarah of the tribe of Judah took of their ctin and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel so he took it and it was candled against Israel and Joshua sent men from Jericho to I which is beside Beth Heaven on the east side of bethl and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ey and they returned to Joshua and said to him unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or 3,000 man go up and smite ey and make not all the people to labor theer for there they are but few so note the assessment as well so they went up theer of the people about 3,000 men and they fled before the men of a and the men of a smoke of them about 30 and six men and they chased them from before the gate even unto shearim and smoke them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became came as water and Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the Earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the even tide he and the Elders of Israel and put dust upon their heads and Joshua said atas oh my Lord God wherefore hast thou at all brought these people over Jordan to leave to deliver us unto the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to God we had been content and dwell on the other side Jordan oh Lord why shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies for the Canaanites and the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall Enon us round and cut off our name from the earth and what will thou do unto thy great name and the Lord said unto Joshua get thee up wherefor liest thou thust upon thy face may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated um I'll just continue a little bit more I'll just continue so just keep your Bibles as I I go along 11 Israel ha sinned and they have also transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have even taken of their ctin and have also stolen and dissembled also and have put it even among their own stuff I'll continue from 16 so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken and he brought the family of Judah and he took the family of zarit of the Zares and he brought the family of the Zares Man by man and zapi was taken and he brought a he brought his household Man by man and aan the son of Cari the son of zabi the son of Zarah of the tribe of Judah was taken and Joshua said unto Aken my son give I pray thee glory to the Lord of Israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou has done hide it not from me and aen answered Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw among the SPs a good babylonish garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight then I coverted them and took them and behold they are HID in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so Joshua sent Messengers and they ran onto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them onto Joshua and to all the children of Israel and laid them out before the Lord and Joshua and all Israel with him took aan the son of Zarah and the silver and the Garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and brought them unto the valley of Acro and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with a fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of the place was called the valley of acho Unto this day amen I know it's a long read but um I try to read as much as possible just to give it context in the in a one room Schoolhouse so to speak praise the name of the Lord now this may sound a bit of like comparing these two scriptures and then my title Is possessing our inheritance amen possessing our inheritance and so um praise the name of the Lord and so there are two things I want to say as we go into this first inheritance what um inheritance is something that is free inheritance is something that does not cost anything now when we say that even if there is a cost it is to the pretty it is to the person who worked to get the inheritance but for you at least in the natural law not in the not with the taxes of the system now but in natural laws inheritance is free and so when a predecessor lives it for an air to the air it costs nothing to the successor it cost nothing now when the Pres sucessor passes on and then he lives it and and I like to say passes on because I don't want to always to relate inheritance to only to death there are sometimes that people inherit things without the without the one who is in h the one without the predecessor necessarily being dead now if you look at this congregation you can look at every child and tell who their parents are because maybe they inherited their habits they inherited their looks their inheritance their appearance and behavior and so inh itance can happen and not necessarily be that the person has died and so when a predecessor passes on what he lives behind oh I went I bought this house and the kitchen is yellow why oh yeah we inherited it from the previous owner right and so that happens now having said that inheritance is free we have to establish something that inheritance is always conditional praise the name of the Lord inheritance is always conditional so somebody could pass on and leave your name in a will in that sense it's specific it's you it cannot be anybody else somebody can pass on and say this is to my female children or my daughters it means being a child of that person is not enough you have to be female as well they could say well um this let's let's put all the Assets in the trust they can access it when they are 18 years old so it's a condition now you have to reach 18 to access it right sometimes they could you know know this could even say you have to marry somebody to ACC access the throne and so inheritance is always conditional and yes it's free but that is where things change that much as it is free and it cannot be ended the conditions can disqualify one person praise the name of the Lord and so that is something that I wanted us to um begin looking at the other side of it is the need and the the importance of our faith in this life's journey now now all of our life Journey as Christians is Promised driven praise the name of the Lord amen that is all everything that we do as Believers is promis driven what do I mean by that we were lost we were miserable we were heading straight to hell we didn't even know it and the Lord came our way he came our way and he showed us our condition he showed us why we were headed by the choices we have made and he told us I still love you and this is my plan for you and if you trust me if you believe me this is where I want to send you and so you would realize that between the two what is happening right now is that we have believed something that we have been told and believing that defies our environment it defies the life that we live it defies how we are born because we are born in sin we are sheded in iniquity but now with that belief what we are holding on to right now becomes an inheritance amen praise the name of the Lord it becomes an inheritance that we are looking for and so without his promises we did not even know we did not even have the desire in our hearts just consider the children of Israel in Egypt all the people who moved to Egypt died and then generation after generation until 400 years later Deliverance comes the people that Moses went to meet were all people who were born in slavery they were all people that the only thing they knew was to be slaves they knew they were different but the only thing they knew was to be slaves they had nothing else but you see the word of God told them that there is a land somewhere for you the word of God told them that if you believe the Lord if you trust the Lord he will lead you there and that in that land you will not be slaves in that land it's flowing with milk and honey for you Hallelujah and so it's the word of God that placed even the desire in their hearts otherwise they didn't even know of anything praise the name of the Lord and the all of the environment was slavery and so at the best they could Aspire for was to be a better slave the best they could Aspire for was to serve their Master well so that maybe they could be the head slave or something nothing beyond that but God had other plans Hallelujah and so here we go with this if we don't allow the promises of God because the is promise driven if we don't allow the promises of God if we don't look through the Bible and find the promise somebody said there are about 7,700 promises in the Bible for the believer and so we are called to look at these things and Abraham says it says if I'm a Christian I'll look through the Bible and find all the blessings that pertain to me am praise the name of the Lord and I'll stay on my feet till the Lord fulfills them hallelujah amen and so the desire even to want something different from what the devil has given us comes from the word of God so if we don't allow these promises to dictate Our Lives then guess what we in Satan's hien our environment will dictate it for us we will look at it we'll say it's wrong it's wrong oh that's how they are well it's normal and then we normalize sin praise the name of the Lord and that is why it's important for always to focus on the word and the promises that are contained in there Hallelujah now what we read is an experience of a people who have received the word of God is the experience of a people who have believed on the Lord is the experience of the people who have acted on the word of the Lord they had seen very many victories and they had even followed the prophet or in the process of possessing the promised land but then suddenly something happens that is not consistent with with the expectation a stunning defeat and it's so stunning that even their leader Joshua is left prostrate on the floor saying Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth her back on her enemies Now understand it in their case the enemies were people because they were conquering and natural possession but let's understand it this way that these enemies were the people that they were supposed to conquer in neither to take the land so until they conquer these people the land is not theirs God has given it to them but they have to overcome these people and so any time you see a jebo side on the land is confirmation that you have not possessed your inheritance anytime you see the the people of AI confirmation that you've not possessed your inheritance anybody that you see on the land that is not like you is confirmation that you've not possessed your inheritance now like we we read the enemies are the three Giants every other thing else are just symptoms of those three Giants right amen hallelujah amen the last of the flesh the last of the eye and the pride of life praise the name of the Lord so this is what we have to overcome and so when you see that maybe I am too lazy to call a brother understand it it's a symptom praise the name of the Lord when we seem to be talking about divorce in the message understand it it's a symptom that there is something we've Not Conquered yet and it's our inheritance and we are the people called to conquer it when all the dressing only personal appearance has to be of sex appeal either shorter or maybe tighter to reveal body understand it there is a a field that we've Not Conquered yet amen hallelujah when I am too lazy to get up and get a job to feed my family understand that there is something that has not been conquered and yet most of you will be wondering what I know I've seen it where addicted to social media can you imagine that I so then I will stay on till 3 a.m. 4: a.m. 5 a.m. and sleep and not go to work so I I get kicked out the devil is Raging and we have to stay focused on the only thing that can keep us sound and saying hallelujah now this happened after God had given his word to Joshua the Lord had told Joshua that everywhere the soul of your feet shall tread upon Ted upon has been given to you so for Joshua footsteps meant possession now I I just want to draw attention to a little bit on the side here that God did not say wherever on Earth you step have giving it to you no because he left Egypt he was in the wilderness that was not given to him wherever the soul of your F shallat in the promised land I've given it to you what am I saying I'm saying that the promised land itself is a promise the token itself is a promise but you see for Israel to thrive for Israel their protection their security for them to be pleasing to God and everything they do was in the promised land every provision they require was in the promised land you understand brothers and sisters that the promised land is the Holy Ghost by understanding that the Holy Ghost itself is a promise but in the Holy Ghost you access every promise that the Lord has for you hallelujah amen so the token itself is a promise but it also places the all other promises within rich and then once you have it we are in a position to possess the rest Hallelujah so let's see I will want to start reading oh nice in the message the everpresent water from The Rock barrah Says if you can believe it whatever whatever God will lead your soul to believe whatever could mean anything but remember he's talking about people whose Souls can be led by God hallelujah so that's why I'm saying you have to access the promised land first and then you have all the promises available to you he said whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours and I believe that if you're in the promised land God will not lead your soul to to believe all desire the garlic of Egypt Hallelujah every place the source of your food can step upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find a key to this law of faith that opens it up you see what I mean that power is controlled by if you're a Son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you hallelujah it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there praise the name of the Living God and so we are talking about something to begin with what they're trying to possess they even didn't know about it it's the word of God that told them about it so this is God's plan this is God's purpose which they have believed and they are going forward in that condition that God has spoken God has given them a a promise and they believe it so the Fulfillment of this word in itself is in the interest of God God desires to fulfill his own promise to his chosen people and that is more than even our willingness to receive the promises of God amen hallelujah amen I know my leaveth let's watch some of this purposes it is the purpose of God to give us the Blessed Holy Spirit how many believe that it is the purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and miracles it's the purpose of God nothing can destroy it all powers of Hell might wager against it but it will prevail we have God's Eternal promise there may be teachers there may be isms right there may be great programs right there may be things that look like that it will be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will prevail then it's not up to me it's not up to you whether it be destroyed or not it's up to God and we can rest assured on it that God will never let our heritage be destroyed it's his promise to give it to us so the heritage is that promise that we have believed is that promise that we are holding on to is that promise that we are watch walking towards Hallelujah is that promise that is driving our very lives that is our heritage so if you are sitting here this morning my question is have you received a promise from God has your identity being revealed to you Hallelujah have you received do you recogn your day and the message in your day Hallelujah I can tell you this that Moses didn't just go to Israel uh go to Egypt to preach and hope somebody will believe it no from the time God called him God told him I'm sending you my people in Egypt Hallelujah and I will tell you this brothers and sisters that brother Abraham did not come here and hope that somebody will believe no he had a mandate he was coming to seek a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ and I can assure you this 2,400 years before now god mentioned you and I in Malachi am Hallelujah so God had us in mind when he called God had you see Moses didn't go to uh uh how do I say the children of Israel were not there because Moses came Moses went there because the children of Israel were there and that is the same we don't come here because of the message the message came here because of you and I Hallelujah and God had a purpose for sending it specifically to us he forew those For Whom The Promise was intended Hallelujah am so it's not a coincidence that you are here let's understand that we didn't call ourselves the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ right that was in the Bible years before many people thought well it applies to all Christians I just thought maybe it's a people who will come one day I just thought it's maybe some symbolism that we don't understand but like everything else in the Bible God designed it that only he can reveal what he meant and so in this time he knew you and I are here and so he sends a prophet to tell us you you are my bride Hallelujah you are my bride and so it's up to us to accept it to believe it to hold on to it and get up praise the name of the Lord and claim our inheritance Hallelujah this is why I always believe that when I question God's interpretation of the Bible to me today I'm questioning my own identity that's right but more than that I'm questioning my my destiny Hallelujah may the Lord help us CU outside the message where is the certainty that I am the bride and especially I am the bride to the exclusion of others what does it take to make a Christian Life 57 baram says may you take me on record this morning friend there isn't enough power in all hell can ever defeat the purpose of God God will do it anyhow Hallelujah and so that means that when he said it is the purpose of God for the Holy Ghost nothing will change it amen when it means that he when he said that it was the purpose of God to send signs and wonders and miracles nothing can change it amen hallelujah so we are in a very good place praise the name of the Lord now what has happened and what we have read right now is that there is a halt in the process of the Fulfillment of the promise of God the question then is does God mean what he says or was this for a different time was it for a different season is it just for a a a a select group of people and we are not part of it what is happening why are there people on earth going under authority of the word of God and then they are turning their backs on their enemies they unable to possess the land when they know their identity when they know their mandate when they know their call why are they turning their backs on their enemies but I love Joshua you know when you know your identity you know who to turn to praise the name of the Lord so Joshua called for a timeout and he asked the obvious and I believe that the boldness to even do that stands from this your certainty in the promises of God for you Hallelujah so he knew that God makes no mistakes right so if we don't get what is expected according to the promise then what's wrong don't we have a right to ask Hallelujah I'm reading from if God be with us then where is all the Miracles I think just the title should have been enough Hallelujah is the Commandment of God for they said he's the same yesterday today and forever so as long as he is to be there forever he's there no question about it he's there where is the Miracles what's hindering the Miracles God sent Christ Christ is alive ever more wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst amen L I'm with you always even to the end of the world there he is his promise Hallelujah what's the matter then we've L the clouds of doubt now brother brah is explaining the clouds of Doubt greed temper selfishness denominations and other things break break in on us break in and take away from the word hallelujah now I never thought that I would you know be talking about Sin and the symptoms of sin and mention denomination but when he said take away from the word there I understood that yes it does that and so we are called today and and when we look out at our lives and we look at our manifestations we are happy we are glad the Lord has been good to us but on the basis on the authority of the word of God we should see more than we have seen and so we should be asking where is that God of the Bible where is the one we read of in the Bible where is the god of William Maron Braham Hallelujah you know last week um brother Justin I think it was last week brother Justin was here and was singing that song and I sat down I was just wondering because you see sister Becky has shared her testimony I think at the end of the year at Saskatoon and for the second time she has beaten cancer and I I was just wondering how many times has healing flowed from here and it had just passed over the tops of the people's head because every provision every promise God has given us is in his word it's not going to come that maybe one day he'll bring a superhuman to preach and they'll have some wings and walking on air no is this simple gospel amen that is where the healing is amen that is where the provision is that is where the life is and so it's flowing from here every day it's flowing in the songs it's flowing in the word and so it like I tell my children there is absolutely nothing with the word we receive the fact is can we tune in to get what is intended for us or do we just come to take off yes we came to church today and that is it a lot is going on but understand it all the things that we read about in Abraham's life it's just a Vindication of the life is that same life if we produce that same life we'll see the same Vindication Hallelujah and so there's a lot going on let's not make it simple or common to us let's keep our Focus Hallelujah somebody get here get to church and then they tune out completely tuned out what do you expect when you are coming to church and you just get here and you tune out completely let's praise the Lord let's let's get up and sing completely tuned out let's pray completely tuned out why bring that Spirit here I dare say it's even dangerous because it's just like the word is just passing on and it's passing on and then it gets to a point we are so used to it we don't we are no longer sensitive to it because whatever everybody has said or somebody can say you've heard it already but what did it do in your life because one thing has to have an effect for on you for you to be able to enjoy the next one and keep enjoying it Hallelujah I'm reading from conferences with God because that's what Joshua did he start a conference he called for a timeout and start conference with god brother says like our brother here in the wheelchair like may maybe you sitting there with cancer or with a heart trouble or something that you know you are going to die right away the en enemy has stopped you he brought you to a halt so in essence only the enemy can do that maybe you come to a a halt before the enemy overtook you maybe there is something in your life that's caused you to hold whatever it is you are you are still have the privilege of a conference let's talk it over with him let's do something about it no matter what the end enemy is he's never too great for our God we need a conference amen hallelujah so I thought to go this way because many of us might have similar questions but let's understand it it's not as if we asking God that oh I want this car so bad Lord help me to get it no we are not asking God to help us achieve our aim this was the people and what they were Desiring to achieve great as it is was first and foremost the purpose of God and still they go forward and they fail right so it is yielding ourselves to God in either to see his own purpose fulfilled in our lives and God's purpose for that time and For That season was to see the Promise he made to Abraham fulfilled for these people and when God God has a purpose brothers and sisters nothing stands before him Hallelujah I'm reading from the reproach for the cause of the Gospel brother says do they realize is that same devil that said come off the cross and I'll believe you turn these stones into bread and I'll believe you it see that's the same devil that tied a rug around our Lord's eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said now if you're a prophet tell us who hates you and will believe you well you know he know who hit him he could have turned those stones to bread or he could have come off the cross but what would we be today if he had and that is the key see the don't know the program of God you must find out what God has promised Hallelujah so even we would have liked God to come up down from the cross and get all the people to repent but you see for my Deliverance for my salvation it takes the blood amen hallelujah and so much as that was tempting he defied it completely and humbly surrendered to death so that you and I will be sitting here today Hallelujah and so nothing stands in the way of the purpose of God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen God has a program it's often not consistent with what we want but it's always better than what we even dream of amen hallelujah and I want to say this that he has a program today and when he has a purpose like I said nothing stands in the way you see God had a purpose to deliver the people out of Egypt and when the time came and the season came Egypt was the most powerful country on Earth understand that they had become very powerful thanks to the fact that they rallied around a gift of God Joseph came through and in the raised him up to the position of prime minister he was running the government and so they had an excellent tax system thanks to Joseph they had an excellent economy thanks to Joseph they had an excellent farming system thanks to Joseph and they had an excellent food storage system thanks to Joseph and they built upon it and they kept building upon it if you go and R and oh yeah Africa we had this and it understand it it was because at some point in time a people rallied around the gift of God and always when you see and recognize the gift of God and you rally around it you receive the blessings that come with that gift what happened was that the people themselves the children of Israel were prospering as Egypt prospered but it got to a point that people looked at them and said these people are too great if we are not careful they will overrun us they will take over and so they started maltreating them they started enslaving them now when people do that to the children of God understand it that is the time of the Fall now I don't say that it's not just Egypt you remember um um Nebuchadnezzar's Place Babylon it was the same thing they [Music] saw Daniel they recognize the gift in him when once more they raised him up to the position of prime minister these people are just smart right didn't they do that in Persia too to modai it's the same thing but they raised him to the position of prime minister and from that position Babylon prospered and prospered but the strangest thing about Babylon worse than Egypt was that in just one generation in the by the time of belazza the the king did not even know Daniel he and that tells you the direction was going he had gone so far from God that he did not know Daniel and so he's there he's relaxed he's drinking oh bring the vessels from the house of the Lord of the god of these is people of Israel and then he gets it and then they start praising the gods of silver and the gods of gold understand that that is when the fall came but when they handwriting came on the wall he saw it he couldn't interpret it he called for all the wise men to come Daniel was not among them when they couldn't explain it and his legs were shaken he still didn't know where to turn to until the wise queen mother came around and said Relax there's a man in your kingdom who does that and the queen mother reminded him that that man was the head of the wise men and your father's time so in just one generation had completely forgotten about praise the name of the Lord hallelujah in just one generation they had completely forgotten about Daniel and that was just when their fall came so our prosperity or our failure depends on what we do with the word of God that we have received we are not like any other people hallelujah so what am I saying that it's a privilege for God to reveal his program for the time and the season that you live to you but then it comes with a responsibility and that is what we have to be very careful about because instead of being a blessing it could turn out a curse if we ignore why God revealed it to us hallelujah but in any case Egypt with all its might could not stop the move of God the Red Sea with all its might could not stop the move of godam talks about it in such a very special way it says it was said one time that Israel was walking in the line of duty to a promised land and right in the line of duty the enemy come and back them up in a corner and the Red Sea cut them off from the line of duty and in their March and God looked down from heaven through the pillar of fire and and the Sea got scared it rolled back its waves because God's waves was in the bottom of the sea and it made way for his children walking in the light of obedience Hallelujah and so nothing stands in the way of God when he has to fulfill his will to his chosen people but now watch this contrast that it says they were walking in the line of obedience so what how much power was displayed there something that had never been seen the world had never experienced anything like that that they see open for a people to walk through and what that comes for whom a people who were walking in line of obedience what I'm saying is should there be any reason why we should disobey God if we know that obedience could lead us to the such a demonstration of power hallelujah amen nothing stands in the way of God's plan and God's program amen hallelujah now there was this pursuing Army and I'm just mentioning this just to confirm the fact that nothing really stands in the way this Army had rejected the word of God in Egypt they had opposed it they had even persecuted the Believers and now they're following them and they following them and they say oh the people are trapped suddenly the supernatural camps they see the place the the see open and the people walking in them these people had children they had the sick they had the elderly they were walking on the floor these were an army they know how to March better than mad doers they had horses they had chariots and so they look at it they say why not if they can do it why not us and so they get in but you see Israel had gotten in on the word of God Hallelujah so in essence these people wanted to enjoy the benefit of the Gospel without living the life and you see this is what I'm saying when you see Vindication don't go after the Vindication go after the life because when the life is lived God will vindicate it Hallelujah in Israel and the church brother BR says and that's what's going to happen one of these days brother when the separating times come and I know that is here and now and to you you look home church member that you are trying to impersonate Christianity one of these days you are going to try to follow oh okay one of these days you are going to try to follow that Holy Ghost band and you'll find out your wheels will come off out y in the mudy samary that's right there was 10 virgins went to meet the Lord five of them were wise and five fish put oil in your lamp trim hair bright one of these days they are going up and there was weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth and those uncircumcised Egyptian I why couldn't they make it they wasn't circumcised they wasn't in the Covenant if they had been circumcised Believers God would have had to recognize them the same way as he recognized Israel Glory doesn't that excite you amen he didn't say oh if they were Jews if they were children Hebrew children no all that mattered is be part of the Covenant and God will vindicate you the same way Hallelujah so I said don't ever imitate Divine Vindication yes because when the life is lived God will vindicate it and so they were all drowned why God was in the process of profilling his promise to his chosen children Hallelujah so when one identifies his or her own place in the Bible according to the word of the Lord as his chosen nothing stands in the way of what God has spoken about praise the name of the Lord I could be talking about how much they faced hunger and God brought Mana from Heaven how much they face thirst and God brought water from the from from The Rock but we all know all of these things and but what I'm getting as right now is this that all these experience Were Meant to tell them that God means just what he says hallelujah I'm going to be reading Exodus 32 sorry there there's a lot of reading today I'm going to be reading Exodus 32 and I'll just pick so that we don't we don't go on for a long time but you see this is the other side of it that nothing stands in the way of the purpose of God yes but they also had to experience what it means to sin against God what it means to go against the word of God and all of this was part of their training now on the surface it looks like that is what they experiencing but what was really happening and I just want to take the time to explain this even I I today I intend to finish quickly what was happening was that from the journey from Egypt and to the promised land the space in between that is where Israel was there were two forces acting on them there was the force of bondage and slavery which at some point they thought was their reality it's pulling them back it's pulling them back into bondage it's pulling them back into slavery that is Egypt and then there was the other promise of the promised land now what had happened was that God had gone ahead of them and brought to them all that he had prepared for them in the form of promise and says there is a land out yonder is Flowing with milk and an if you trust me I'll send you there but that's all they had the word and so the reality of slavery was higher and so until you take all of Egypt out of you because you see it's easy to take them out of Egypt but it's not easy to take Egypt out of them and until you take Egypt out of you you cannot inherit the Promised Land Hallelujah and I believe that is where we are we need to get Egypt out of Us Praise the name of the Living God exodx 32 I'm starting from 21 it says and Moses said unto Aaron what did this people unto thee so this is a time and sorry way back in Exodus 12 Moses they had come to Mount Si and Moses had received the LW and he had given it to the people he spoke it they heard it he told the others they heard it and then God came down and there was clouds and all of the manifestations and the people got scared and they said Lord uh Moses don't let God speak to us you go listen and come and tell us and so all of this had happened and now Moses is separated he go goes to the mountain and for 40 days they don't hear from him and when the people were separated from their Prophet they sought leadership in man and It produced The Golden Cal I'll just stay there because that's not the purpose of this but understand this and so after that God sees what is going on and sends Moses down and so this is when all of that had happened Moses had come he had seen them worshiping the golden Cal he's very displaced the Lord is very displaced and so this is where this interaction is going on Moses said unto Aaron what did these people unto thee that thou H has brought so great a sin upon them and Aaron said let not the anger of my Lord Works H thou knowest the people that they are set on Mischief for they said unto me make us gos we shall go before us for us for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we would not what is become of him so now you see that idolatry of Egypt for just the slightest reason is coming out we know no matter how far you go you can never possess the promised land when there's Egypt in you right and so all these people paid with their lives Hallelujah am so but where I want to point to the danger is that it's not just those who did it and that is easy for us to rationalize it that's easy for us to say oh yeah they they they worshiped idols and they died but what is the effect on the rest of the congregation and this is what I want us all to think about how how does it feel like who here wants to be responsible for killing another not just you in your room or you no no you step outside go to your neighbor and put a sword through them and so much as these people died it's not any easy on the entire congregation praise the name of the Lord amen and let's imagine you kill somebody do you kill their children or do you leave their orphans them orphans and if you kill them maybe their children also went to work you kill them your children now know that you killed their friends there was no Pleasant situation in that but you see when you are part of a body your actions have consequences on the entire body let's be mindful of that Hallelujah I'll just read this uh the same Exodus st2 I'll read uh 25 to 28 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus says the Lord God of Israel put every man his his sword by his side and go in and out from the gates and through out the camp and slay every man his brother every man His companion every man his neighbor and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and they fell on the they fell of the people that day 3,000 men so understand it 3,000 men still holding on to the bondage of Egypt but still the good thing is there are people who were committed to the service of the Lord and when you are committed to the service service of the Lord you put your shoulder to the wheel they didn't allow social expectations to influence them they had to do it and they did it it's not always pleasant but it is life for us hallelujah I'll just give another example and then we I'll be done with this Reading part numbers 25 and this time it's after Israel bam balak they encountered uh Israel came BAC couldn't control them he called for help from Bam Bam came he tried to curse them and as long as they were in the camp he couldn't car them so Israel was supposed to stay in the camp and belac Bam watches over it and it's a spiritual man and he descends that there is only one way you can condemn these people and that is if you get them to displease their God is the same today the devil is seeking to get you to displease God and it's for us to take a stand and say no to the devil Hallelujah if we are ever going to possess anything of the promises that God has given us we need to take a stand I'm reading numbers uh 25 and isra Israel in shim and the people began to commit hom with the daughters of Moab and they called the people onto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto Balor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people and H them up before the Lord against the son that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel Moses said unto the judges of Israel slay ye every man everyone his men that were joined onto Bal so again the judges had the uncomfortable job of killing their own people but it was necessary to keep the sanity of the camp otherwise the camp will be there without God and when you a Believer without God you are the most helpless of all on Earth hallelujah amen so sin is an action and it has wages and the wages of sin his death Hallelujah so before we take any step first of all how does it affect the collective and how does it affect your brothers and sisters and how does it affect the program of God now in both of these in instances people paid with their lives but you see that did not stop God hallelujah because still nothing stands in the way of God's program praise the name of the Lord nothing stands when God is proving his way to his chosen people but there is a cause for Disobedience Hallelujah now how come the program of God that could not be stopped by Egypt could not be stopped by the Army it could not be stopped by the Sea it could not be stopped by the the walls of Jericho how come such a program suddenly has come to a halt what is it a babylonish garment a babylonish garment that is it you see how we are love the little things to get in the way of God's program a babylonish garment and all the devil did was to get aan to believe that you could still have the Garment and be in the camp think of it as we go ahead all the devil did was to get them to believe that you could have the Garment and be in the camp but before God it was either or it's either you have God on the camp in the camp or you have the babylonish Garment praise the name of the Lord why it was an accursed thing I'm reading here from presuming a can't of this little old W it won't make any difference the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair I'll do the same watch that it w't make any difference but what did it do it never brought pleasure to his family it brought death to every one of them and when we compromise on any commandment of God to please the people we kill the thing right there one little witch one Babylonian government stopped the marching Army brother one thing that we permit the church to do that is wrong one thing that we would't call out against and make the people straighten it up it'll stop the march of the church they presume you are going on you may be in name we may be in numbers that ain't what counts that isn't what counts is God With Us God in us God moving through us his word alive in us hallelujah so pretending that God are not spoken about it or pretending that it does doesn't matter or it's too minor for God to think about and pretending that God didn't mean it when he spoke it or even saying that it is subject to interpretation Brothers before we go ahead Haring the laugh of the world think of it again how does it affect the program of God and how does it affect my brothers and sisters Hallelujah I'm rushing to finish in adoption brother Braham says God made us a promise and there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall out our feith he's talking about Joshua now and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere cuz we got 16 dead dead man laying there they are Israelite brothers and they are dead why did they die innocent man because one man stepped out of line you see the reason this needs to be taught Hallelujah and that's why I'm standing here the reason this needs to be taught one man gets out of the line and it's part of the body it has an impact on the rest of the body that's right Hallelujah the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other walking perfectly upright soberly before all man fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not done took the life of 16 man I think it was 16 maybe more and so says it but I I I I I there is a little part that I want he also said right there that I want to add that when we bring the sick be up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a Solem fast call an assembly something is wrong somewhere God made the promise God God's got to stick to that amen and he'll do it amen praise the name of the Lord am so the word of God caed for total separation God said don't touch thean and he meant what he said may the Lord help us not be not to be the ones to bring a ho to his program Hallelujah because you see the people were defeated because of their cursing all the people were being defeated because of the are Christ now when you bring that to the camp you are bringing the feet to the camp but worse than that is that you are bringing you are getting God out of the camp Hallelujah now brother Abraham visits an observatory and he's commenting about the Zodiac and this that's in the message the greatest battle ever fought and I don't know much about astrology but speaks about Leo and Virgo and all of that but there this part where it says and I thought then if that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of kater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirits and so just quickly when we look at this program when we look at this babylonish garment they also used to call it what the mantle of China and even the other versions of the Bible uses that it's not just an old Shepherd's cloak no it's a very stylish garment it's classic it represents luxury it represents status they lead in society among the canites wear it and and and the interesting thing is when they wear it they don't fall down convulsing to death when they wear it they don't get stricken by by by by a thunderbolt when they wear it nothing happens to them in fact they are admired aren't we humans just like them and that is what we should ask ourselves right and you look out there and when people put on their makeup they are not offending anybody and they don't die and there are female ministers putting on their pants and their makeup and getting into the pulpit and nothing happens to them aren't we humans like them you know most of us interpret sin in terms of how it affects us or it affects this and we fail to realize that the most important thing is how does God see it hallelujah amen and so we F to realize that we are chosen people for a Divine Purpose and when we say a Divine Purpose what we are saying is this it's not we doing is God doing through us so in our hearts they always have has to be room for the Lord to Reign and when God comes and he's not leading he's not even here praise the name of the Lord we may convince ourselves that he is but he's not and so if there is any Egypt in us let's get it out Hallelujah now let's look at this situation Israel got into the uh Red Sea they passed through Egypt got there passed through and died now the canites are wearing these babylonish garment now imagine it's very expensive because from Iraq and that this that was not a there was no pilor or DHL there they had to use horses and everything so for that to come all the way from Iraq to Israel think about it but they wear it and they admired Israel it and they are dead understand it we are different people and it's the call that makes you different and when you fail to acknowledge the call you are denying your own identity you want to be happy you want to feel free go the way of the message Hallelujah aen must have thought that this little this little thing doesn't matter much but if God said it then it matters Hallelujah there are many times we see things that are useful in the world that are harmless in the world and so we consider what the word of God says about and we don't consider what the word of God says about it and yet that is what matters most and we are tempted to bring it right into the midst of the people time is far spent but in the story of um numbers 25 that we read the continuation of the story was that a one of the children of Israel brought a medanite woman into the camp and the Bible says in the presence of Moses he did that but you see there was somebody who was zealous for the things of the Lord Finas took a javelin and thrust it through the two of them and he killed both of them right and the Lord was pleased with finus Hallelujah and so it's up to us to know and decide the line that we are going to th Hallelujah but when God makes his his T clear and it's for us to to that line Hallelujah we cannot go home and turn on and listen to this worldly music and listen to this and on and on and on and expect to have Victory and expect to possess the land it doesn't happen that way I think in prophets it says shall a man take fire and not be burnt praise the name of the Lord what is our disposition when we come to church you know last week I I picked a cookie rapper there and and and I was with I was with another Deacon I showed it to him and and you see the the the the bigger problem is not because there is a cookie wrapper there it's a church it will be cleaned but if that is our attitude when we come to church yes how do we expect to receive from God to eat in the sanctuary yeah maybe it was given to a little person who knows right but the bement would work it will serve the same purpose but should food be brought and used in here and so let's be mindful of these things if you really know that you wouldn't do that at the office of whoever a mayor is or the premere should we bring that to the house of the Lord respecting the sanctity of the sanctuary you know somebody has come here and not everybody can come every day somebody comes once in a month Maybe twice in a month or once a week and then they're here and for them to tune in and get what they can get from the Lord oh yeah we are going to sit with a kids so to see and completely distracted when sometimes not always sometimes all it takes is holding the hand and nobody else will be distracted should we bre the people bringing putting a ho to the program of God to somebody receiving from the Lord hallelujah let's honor the sanctity of the sanctuary praise the name of the Lord Brothers you know we are responsible for everything that happens in the house everything and as a man a family man over a family of five it's not easy for me to even stand here and say this but you see we love our wives the truth is they don't have four hands and three legs so it will help if I can hold one for her to hold the other then the children are a we able to contain them if even look I'm the more spiritual in my house I'll take all of them sister listen so that you'll be an even better wife than you have been to me it helps it doesn't help when we think that oh it's in it's our tradition and this no we are responsible for it let's hold on let's honor the sanctity of the presence of the Lord because there is a benefit there and when you recognize it and you do it that way one of the best benefits is that our children watch us and the way we behave in the house of the Lord it'll reflect on them it's way more than the what we tell them praise the name of the Lord these children they grow quickly at the time you bite your eye they are taller than you and you are talking to them up there presuming bam say he presumed that it was all right but go God's commandment will take nothing out of the curity don't have nothing around you that's cursed then how can we smoke cigarettes how can women cut their hair God says that when they do that it's wrong how can you wear these little old trousers of a thing that you wear when God said women a woman that puts on a garment pertains to a man it's an abomination in his side God don't change how can we do it and it's just pre presuming that's all right it's not all right it's not all right our Pentecostal women does a thing like that you better stop and check up shake yourself look back you know it's it's it's been about I don't know how many years but let's forget about that there was a service we held in that Community Center and the brother came around gave a powerful testimony I suppose the brother was from Manitoba and I I may get these details wrong but I I'll convey the import of what happened his testimony was about the wife being sick for a long time and Home Care was coming and it was getting worse and then when they prayed about it the Lord spoke to him that if you don't stop the gossip it's not going to get well and when he stopped the gossip in the after of a week the wife was discharged from home care right so that little thing was holding them from possessing that promise God does not change my brother God does not change you know I have been in a meeting and I know I've said this so many times and I I'll probably skip a few things and then and then close I have been in a meeting that I had had just become a message believer and in this this those times on at Christmas time we will all gather at some place isolated place and do fasting prayer meetings Easter will gather at one place and do fasting prayer meetings and they bring this girl around completely out of her mind shouting and in Chains and everything and they GI her are praying for her and they're praying they're praying and then the prophecy comes and IT addresses the mother directly you are in involved in a landed litigation that is why your first child died and if you don't stop this one will also die and so right there the woman says that's it she's done with a with a land indication by the time the meeting ended there was prophecy that the girl has been healed and we were all glorifying God and everything it was an evening everything right the next morning the girl was still the same even went by back home in it took months before she came to herself what happened why am I in chain and then they explain her situation to her she was delivered but you see we shouldn't allow things representations of Egypt to get in the way of our work because until Egypt comes out of us we are not making it to the promised land I will get to I'll will call the musicians all I'm saying at this point is let's understand that there is a reason everything happens if we get here this morning and we try the door to the to the church and it's not opening we don't just assume oh yeah it's it's the church doesn't says there is no church no there is something wrong with the door and we have to find out what is wrong we have to call where is the God we read of in the Bible where is the god of William Braham Hallelujah because this message declares far greater promises than we live as children of God and brother Braham says we live below our privileges but so long as it is promised to us and we have identified ourselves as recipients of these promises then we have to live in expectation of it Hallelujah because we possess literally the very final promise of humanity Hallelujah God has spoken so many beautiful things to us and we need to treat it as such we have to go ahead and possess our inheritance and if we believe it if we know this is the inheritance and we really believe it we'll just go forward and take it but if we don't we may work our way out of our inheritance and that is the serious position may make the fleshly desires may get out of the way Hallelujah I remember when they do it will not stop God it will only stop us hallelujah these promises we read of our inheritance let's go for it shall we be on our feet just have to
