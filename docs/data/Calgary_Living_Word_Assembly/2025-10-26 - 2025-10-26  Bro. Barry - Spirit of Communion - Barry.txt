Stand as me if you would as we change the order tonight or this morning, sorry. Can you hear the sound from heaven? It's a sound of worship coming from his throne. Where's his throne today? Right here. &gt;&gt; This is the throne of God this morning. Sing it this morning as our pastor comes singing holy, holy, holy. You think about the the the being that God is. He desires worship so much that he created cherubams and angels to worship him day and night singing holy, holy, holy for millions, billions, trillions of years. who knows before he stepped on the scene and said, "Okay, it's time to create the world." Think about that. The God of glory desires worship. Here we are the redeemed this morning. Well, can you hear the sound from heaven?

Welcome to the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each and everyone just have a few requests that we'd like to bring before the throne this morning. &gt;&gt; Remember Sister Germaine and the family, Sister Debbie Fussy and the family. Want to remember the Nigeria hostage situation. Also like to remember my mother-in-law, Sister Elaine. Brother Daniel Omillion. He has a a f business friend. Farhead Shamzian I believe is the name. He needs he needs a a prayer. He asked for prayer. This is a I believe a Muslim man asked brother Daniel for prayer that he could sell a house. And we know if God could heal a body, he could sell a house. &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that we can call you our gracious heavenly father, because you are so wonderful to us, Lord, so merciful and long-suffering, Lord, and all of our ways. But, Father, we're so thankful that our ways are not your ways. And neither are our thoughts your thoughts. Your thoughts are higher than ours, Lord. And we're so thankful that we can not look at ourselves, Lord Jesus, but we can look to you. We can look at you, Father, and look to see the image of you, Father, in one another. Lord Jesus, this morning, more than anything, our desire is to exalt you above everything, Father. Above all of our problems, all of our circumstances, all of our situations. Father, we love you and we thank you for your goodness to us, Lord. Because we know the only reason we're here today is because of your goodness. The only reason we have breath in our lungs is because of your goodness, Lord. Oh, Father. And then to be able to understand the word for our day. Talk about mercy. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for your ever loving kindness to us, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord, this morning we just want to remember the needs, Father, that &gt;&gt; were brought forward, that were made known unto you, Lord Jesus. We know that Sister Charmaine needs a touch from you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We know that her family needs a touch from you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember all of her children, Lord Jesus. Brother Dodie and his family, Lord. And &gt;&gt; oh, Father, Brother Martin and Sister Adijah, Brother Mua and his family, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that they all desire to come and worship. And we pray that Lord Jesus, even through these circumstances, their desire would be to come and worship you more. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that would be the the mama's desire, Sister Charmaine. And Father, she has held the line in her home. Father, we pray that you would just strengthen her, that you would encourage her, Father, that you would bless her abundantly above all she could ask or think. Lord, Father, we thank you for touching Sister Charmaine and her family. Lord, we just want to remember Sister Deb Busy, Brother Charlie, Lord Busy, and and the family, Lord, the loss of Sister Debbiey's sister. pray that you would just be with them.

We can't even understand it, but we just trust you, Lord. in the midst of the trial. &gt;&gt; And we just pray for those families, Lord, and the congregations and the pastors affected by these these actions, Lord, &gt;&gt; that your will would be done. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to remember Sister Elaine, my mother-in-law. Father, she needs a touch from you, Lord. And we're so thankful that you're more than able. We pray that you would just heal her now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you for touching her. We just want to remember the need that brother Daniel brought forward, Lord, for Farhead, his business partner, Lord, his business associate. Lord, one more time, we just invite you to come on the scene at the word of brother Daniel and just minister to that need, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. Lord, &gt;&gt; now Father, we just invite you, Lord, to minister to each and every need that was made known unto you this morning by the way of an uplift hand in our congregation here. We know that you know the need. We know that you allowed the situation to come. And Father, it was because you had a desire in your heart, an attribute that you wanted to express. And we just invite you, Father, to express that to us and through us. Father, we pray that you would sovereignly meet the needs, Lord Jesus, in the hearts of your children this morning. Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you. We just commit this service into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful start to the service this morning. Thank you to each one for the specials. It really does something. It sets an atmosphere. God bless you. Amen. I uh I noticed something this morning that I just needed to announce. Maybe if you want to turn in your Bibles with me to Genesis chapter 14. I believe we have someone very special in our midst today. And uh I just would like to welcome I believe and I could be wrong. Is that Mrs. Juma Bulandi we have with us in our midst. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you sister Juma's wife his bride has been working on the immigration status for a long time now probably over a year and uh here she is. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's answered prayer. God bless you sister. also like to welcome our friend brother Gordon Dole with us. God bless you brother. &gt;&gt; It's good to have you here. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 14 verse 10. Genesis 14 verse 10. I'm sure we're all familiar with this scripture. And the veil of Sidim was full of slime pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there. And they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their vituals and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram&lt;unk&gt;s brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom and his goods, and departed. And there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew. For he dwelt in the plain of Mamry, the Amorite, brother of Echel, the brother of Anar, and these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smokeote them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus. And he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods. And the woman also and the people. The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedor and of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shabbath, which is the king's dale. And Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, &gt;&gt; and he was the priest of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand." And he gave him tithes of all. &gt;&gt; And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, "Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself." And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread, even to a shoe latchet, and that I will not take anything that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich. save only that which is the young men which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me anor and memory let them take their portion let's just bow one more time heavenly father we thank you Lord that we have this scripture here and we can see so many types and shadows in it father we just pray that you would take this word that's spoken and &gt;&gt; written and Lord that you would break it open to us fresh once again. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Welcome back to the house of the Lord this morning. Just a few announcements before we get into our scripture. We've got the communion service tonight, this afternoon, actually at 5:30 p.m. I was thinking about this as I was announcing it, and I know some people, they actually get upset if you don't have a communion service after 6:00 in the evening because then it's not actually a supper. It's not the Lord's supper. But, you know, I don't think that the Lord really gets too hung up on semantics when it comes to things like this. I think that's more of a legalistic perspective myself, but uh I'm sure someone would have something to say about it if they really saw it that way. And you know, we're entitled to see things the way that I guess the spirit leads us. But I think really he knows our heart and what our heart's desire is if we're willing to come and actually partake of the communion service. It'll be at 5 5:30 tonight. And uh we also have a testimony service. So, it's always a wonderful time of just I believe giving giving the Lord the praise and at the same time giving the devil a black eye &gt;&gt; because we share what the Lord is actually doing in our lives today. It's not about somewhere out in the future or, you know, something in the past necessarily. It's actually what he's doing right now. And I think that's a tremendous thing. We have the youth service coming up on the 31st. While the whole world goes and celebrates Halloween and death and hell and the grave, we can get together and worship God. And that's what the uh youth service is about. We've got that on the 31st at 7:30 here in the sanctuary. And uh we have brother Cadre Diggs coming on November the 22nd at 6 PM and the 23rd at 10:00 a.m. And also uh we mentioned it on Wednesday, but we are putting together a graduation celebration for 2025 and it will actually be in May or June in 2026. So uh we also want to catch up on any of the graduates who have graduated uh who haven't been celebrated in the body here in the last few years. We certainly want to celebrate and appreciate your achievements as well. It applies to post-secary degrees or diplomas and grade 12 graduations as well. So, if you have um graduated any one of those three uh items and you would like to celebrate, we will be planning an event in May or June of uh 2026. So, God richly bless you. We'll certainly keep you posted as things develop. Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Today I want to just talk about um a little bit about communion and I felt led to go down the road of uh Melzdc and Abram. You know it was before Abram actually had a name change. He actually met with the Lord and you know there was a few steps in his life that he had to go through and one of them was he had to actually follow the leadership of the Lord, the direction of the Lord. He told him to leave all of his family and all of his home and actually travel to a new location. And uh he did that, but he didn't actually do it exactly according to the word of God. And that's the call for the bride in the age in which we live is to follow the word exactly according to the word of God. And you know, Abram, he was blessed all the way along until there began to have strife between the herdsmen. That's what the story is, right? We're probably not going to read it today, but there was strife between the herdsmen. And why is that? Naturally speaking, you can say there wasn't enough to go around to feed all the animals. But we know spiritually speaking, the natural types the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we start to feel a little bit of pressure in a natural realm, it can actually be dealing with a spiritual level in a person's life. And it isn't always, but we know in this particular case, it was for sure. &gt;&gt; It was definitely a spiritual matter. And Lot had to separate himself from Abram. Better yet, Abram had to separate himself from Lot because Lot was just along for the ride. And we know that Abram's brother had died. He passed away and he felt for his nephew. He wanted to look after him. But that wasn't according to the word of God. So, he had to actually separate himself. And once he did, then he began to hear from God again. &gt;&gt; And here we are in the situation of of him hearing from God. But, you know, in in in in light of our our day today, we're we're having the communion service tonight. I I wanted to talk a little bit about communion, and there's many different angles we could go to, and I'm probably not going to try and keep us here late today, so we'll just see how this goes. But talking about communion, and and being in the spirit of communion, I think it's a wonderful thought to be in the spirit of communion, don't you? to think that we have the ability to actually meet with Melzdc exactly like Abram did. And everyone, I'm sure, would say, "Well, it's probably going to be the deacons at the front and maybe Brother Barry's going to be here." But if that's all we're seeing, if that's all we're anticipating, we're missing the point, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because the word of God says to discern the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; And I think it's a beautiful thing. And I found a quote like I usually do, but I found a quote where brother Bradom he speaks specifically to the Lord's body. Discerning the Lord's body. It's in Cood. You can go and find it and I didn't want to bring it because it's kind of a little different angle this morning. I might tonight, but brother Bradom, he talks about it in Cood. The bride's body is actually discerning the body. Discerning the Lord's body is specifically the bride's body. That's exactly the quote brother Brandham says. I wasn't going to bring it, but I find myself doing it. It's amazing. But uh in the spirit of communion is what I want to talk about today. And you know, true communion isn't just coming and mechanically going through the motions. &gt;&gt; It's not just saying that I've come and I've done my deed. I I I came and and I I I I was a part I witnessed the the Holy Eucharist and I I I did things according to the way our church does it. And it's just coming and and discerning the Lord's body and and taking a few minutes and reading the scripture and then maybe we'll we'll have some wine. We'll drink a little bit of wine and eat a little bit of the bread and and then we go home and we did our duty. If that's what's going on, we're missing the point entirely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Entirely. That is not it. &gt;&gt; It's all about realizing that the blood is the wine, &gt;&gt; the bread is the body. This is exactly what Jesus instructed. His very last meal on this side, the very last taste of food that he had on this side of eternity in his corporal body was the communion supper, the last supper. And he instructed his disciples to do this all the while until he actually returns. So, I want to talk about the spirit of communion today and how true communion really is only through the leadership by the spirit. And uh I I just I've probably mentioned it in the past, but I think it's a a fascinating discussion when you look at the message of the hour. And is it any accident that the very last message that brother Brandham preached was communion? &gt;&gt; The very last one. But what was the message just before that? &gt;&gt; It was leadership. leadership was before communion. And you know, I personally believe this. This is brother Barry's view and I think it's real important because it's my view. No, I think it's important because it's the word of God. We're not going to have true communion unless we are actually led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're not led by the spirit, if we're just doing it out of duty, then we're actually not truly having communion. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to talk about today is is being led by the spirit. We we we want to get in the spirit of things. I think it's so good brother Paul said that, you know, talking about getting in the spirit. We could get in the spirit of the ball game in this world. You know, the Canadian team is actually going to the World Series. They're in the World Series. Yeah. But when we get to church, what's going on? &gt;&gt; Are we afraid to get excited? &gt;&gt; I I'll say this. Are we afraid to get a little tempo? Are we afraid to actually move our feet? Are we afraid to dance in the spirit? It's wonder wonderful to think about other people doing it and and getting to that place, but what about us? &gt;&gt; What are we going to do when we're the ones in heaven realizing that we were hanging over hell by a a link in a chain? Our souls were hanging over hell. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't anything that we did. It was just the grace of God that said, "I want that link and I want that link and I want that link and that link right there." But all the rest of them, they fall down into hell. I can tell you one thing. I I I'm not a gymnast, but I'll be doing back flips. &gt;&gt; I'll be shouting. I'll be screaming. I will be so thankful. But, you know, I don't want to wait till I'm there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to give them praise here. Like we say many times, this is our opportunity to practice our our most important special of our lives. Cuz when we get over there, all heaven's going to be quiet to hear our special, to hear the redeemed, praise the Lord. Oh my, that's going to be a tremendous thing. &gt;&gt; But you know, leadership is only going to happen the way that it's supposed to is if it is leadership by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it always goes back to the spirit. All of the roads go back to the spirit. Especially when brother Barry's preaching, you got to get the Holy Ghost. If we don't get the Holy Ghost, then we're only living off of somebody else's experience, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, &gt;&gt; we can have a tremendous atmosphere in the building, but what good is it if it's not us bringing that atmosphere? If it's not us participating in that atmosphere. True communion is only going to be by the leadership of the spirit. And it's not just leadership by the spirit. This is where it gets really good, brothers and sisters, because I would say leadership by the spirit is is right up until the Isuza Street revival. The whole entire thing that happened in 1906, but then there was a mighty move of God. Not just speaking in tongues and an outpouring of the spirit. We know that happened in in in Ashbury. Was that down in the states just recently there was another outpouring of the spirit in a in a in a college and the news was covering it and everyone was excited about it. But what about the vindication of a vindicated prophet? What about God coming down and actually issuing a prophetic utterance to the age in which we are living in now? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just leadership by the spirit, but by by the person of Jesus Christ now living out through his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His bride body actually manifesting in his body. And I know that gets a little bit tense sometimes to even talk like that &gt;&gt; because it takes the onus off of everyone else and it puts it right on us to think how could I be that literal body? But we are his literal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. on earth. &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of the word for our day. &gt;&gt; We sing that song. We are the word made flesh today. That's what the scriptures say. &gt;&gt; Our names are seen within. &gt;&gt; Redeemed and what? &gt;&gt; Perfect without sin. &gt;&gt; We are anointed. My I think it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; But we actually are manifesting his body to this world. So it goes from just being led by the spirit a and and and following the leadership of the Lord to actually being the Lord. Being the manifestation of his spirit to this world. Now I know it sounded crazy. I'm not saying that we're God. But if you've got the Holy Ghost in you, who are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not cohabitating with anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; I think it's really important, really, really important to make sure that we know exactly where we stand. &gt;&gt; And and you know, we're not we're not interested in looking at at at the future and saying that, you know, somewhere way out there it's going to get really good. It's going to be so much better, even though it will be and and it's going to be. We're we know that's going to happen. But looking back and saying, you know, the the ministry of William Brham and if we could have just been in the meetings and seeing all the signs and wonders that took place, what about today? What about today? Isn't he the same yesterday, today, and forever? Hebrews 13:8 applies or it doesn't. But we're not looking at historical version of communion today. Even though we are even though we are, we're starting with the scripture in Genesis. I know. I know. Genesis chapter 14 talking about how we have Abram. He hasn't had a name change yet, but we know that he's on a journey. The Lord is leading him. &gt;&gt; But what what I want to get to a little bit today is understanding that when we take communion, what's actually taking place? &gt;&gt; What's going on when we take communion? As we mentioned already, is it just the duty? Is it a civic duty? Is it our religious duty to just come and take the bread and to take the wine and or or is it more? I I believe it's a whole lot more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're actually following the direct leadership of Jesus Christ who is God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Breaking the bread for his brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Breaking the wine into the cup and pouring it out and and giving it to them and saying, "Take, drink. This cup is my blood." &gt;&gt; Yes. And they had no idea what was going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The disciples didn't. But can you imagine Jesus in the moment knowing what was going to happen? &gt;&gt; Oh my. But understanding when we take communion, what's actually taking place? We're discerning the Lord's body. And you know, we have the opportunity when we're discerning the Lord's body to actually search our hearts to say, "Lord, is there anything inside of me that would hinder this blessing from coming upon me?" Because we know that the word says that many are sick and weakly among you. Why? Because they fail to discern the Lord's body before they take communion. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be sick and weekly, do we? None of us do. And I know I've been sick and weakly. And I'll say it this way a little bit in my body, but mostly in my soul, mostly in my spirit because I've come and done it. I'll tell you, I've come and done it out of a duty without the revelation about what's really going on. Sometimes we get into a little bit of a we'll call it a funk &gt;&gt; in our lives. We can get there and we just sort of put one foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other. But you know, there's more. We don't have to live in that state. That is not the state where God wants us to be. &gt;&gt; We know his word says that he would that we would prosper and be in good health. &gt;&gt; Not being sick and and and weekly. &gt;&gt; So today, brothers and sisters, let's bring it right down home today. Where is the Lord's body? Where is the Lord's body? We know that the Lord's body is the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we take communion, we know the wine represents his blood. And we know the bread represents his body. The wine represents the blood that was shed. &gt;&gt; The body the bread represents the body that was broken for us. &gt;&gt; And I think it's so amazing because if we think about it, every time when we take communion, if we can just remember it maybe tonight when we pray about it, when you hear that bread cracking, think about the Lord's body. Not one of his bones was broken, but sure, he sure took the stripes, didn't he? But why did he take those stripes? &gt;&gt; For our healing, &gt;&gt; not so that we could be sick and weakly. &gt;&gt; No, so that we could actually be thoroughly healed. &gt;&gt; But I think, you know, brothers and sisters, I just want to encourage us. I know it was a tremendous start to the service today. And I just think it's so good. It's exactly what brother Paul said. You know, in the world, people get into the spirit of things. And I just want to encourage us to get into the spirit of communion to to really really realize what it means. And and for us, you know, many times I'll just say it because I'm a pastor. I have to many times we'll see the church full to to this morning. But when communion service happens, it's half full. Half the people aren't here. Half the people that claim to believe the message of the hour that it's not a communion. And I don't know why. Is it because your heart condemns you? I want to say just get right with God. Just ask him. Forgive me if that's the case. Does half of the body work? I don't know. I don't know. I just want to encourage us. Don't miss out on communion. It's one of the most important services that we could ever do. And you know why? Because there's another part to it. Another part that's really really important. And that is the footwashing portion. The footwashing portion. That's that's weird. Many people would say that's so bizarre and weird. But you know, the Bible says happy are they that do these things. Happy are ye if you do these things. So, how could we just overlook it? Many times people will say, "Well, it was for a different uh culture because people wore sandals that were open and they walked on dirty streets." And sure enough, it was. But for Jesus to say that you ought to do these things, &gt;&gt; u we to do it if he said, "Do it." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that's the trick of the devil in the age in which we live. You don't have to do that. You know, you you you won't die. No, you won't surely die. It'll be okay. You don't have to take communion. You don't have to go to church on Wednesday nights. You don't have to go early according to what the prophet said. You don't have to do any of that. You can worship the way that you want. When we start doing that, we let the things slip, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Things begin to slip in our lives. And you know what we do is we rob ourselves from the power of God living out through our lives, manifesting in our lives, and before long, we find ourselves weak and sickly. You know, brother Brandham, he says it I I think I'll say it this way that the spirit says it through brother Brandham every time we listen or we read the church age book. He says don't go through the acts first. Don't go through the acts first. Don't come and take communion first. Don't don't just go to church first. Even though you should go to church. We have the conversation earlier today. Come as you are. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come as you are. Come and get washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't don't just go through the acts first. Get in the spirit &gt;&gt; and then go through the acts &gt;&gt; and watch what God will do. &gt;&gt; Now, if this is what brother Brandham was saying, I think it's wonderful because you could see the prophet of God saying, you know, just just do it this way and just see what will happen. But if this is truly inspired word of God through a vindicated prophet, if this is a prophetic utterance saying this, then this isn't a man saying it. It's God saying, "Don't go through the acts first. Get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do." &gt;&gt; And I'll say it this way and watch what I will do. &gt;&gt; If it's God speaking, just watch what I will do. Come to church half an hour early. Try going to church. Sacrifice whatever it takes to go to church on Wednesday night and see if God won't pour out a blessing that you can't even contain. Tithing isn't all about money. Many times we go there and we say it's all about money and I'm going to give a certain percentage and I want to see the the golden doors in heaven open up and fill up my storehouses so they're full and No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Do something else. Try and give God something different to honor and see if he won't. &gt;&gt; But don't go through the acts first. Get in the spirit first. Come to church half an hour early. Come to church earlier than the deacons. upset the deacons a little bit. &gt;&gt; Come to church early and get in the spirit first &gt;&gt; like we've already heard and see what happens. See what God will do. We know in this very church, in this very building, God manifested in such a way in a regular Wednesday night service where a woman was healed of cancer, a sister was healed of breast cancer. The word of God came to her in the middle of the song service, just in the middle of the song service and says, "Stand up and receive your healing." &gt;&gt; And what'd she do? &gt;&gt; She did. &gt;&gt; And what happened? God did. It's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But don't go through the acts first. We can get so hung up on just trying to go through the acts. You know, we've got all the mechanics. All of the mechanics. We're talking about the old-timers in the message. and you know how they've seen it all. They've they've witnessed all the winds of doctrine and all the different ways of doing things. They've seen the mechanics from every single angle. I think it would be beautiful to just sit down and fellowship with them with some coffee and no time limit. But you know, many times I think that we we we can get so hung up on the mechanics and it becomes a legalistic perspective on what we're doing. We need to just get into the spirit and see what God will do because he wants to do way more than I think we're ready for many times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, talking about our scripture today, verse 18 of Genesis chapter 14, it was only after Abram, he heard there was trouble. He heard there was trouble. He heard that this sodomite condition attracted his nephew and his nephew was down there and he wasn't happy about it. And I can't help but think he just had an opportunity in his own heart to go and deliver his nephew from the clutches of this evil. &gt;&gt; But here he's captured and taken captive. And what did Abram do? We know that he chased the men. He chased the kings. He chased them until he actually got them. And we know that in verse 14, he says that he pursued them unto Dan. And brother Brandham, he brings it out in the message. He says that this is to the uttermost part. He went as far as he could possibly go, as far as he had to go. He got the job done. He went for his nephew. And brother Brandham, I believe he brings it out and he says, "Are we willing to do that for our brother and for our sister?" &gt;&gt; Are pastors willing to do that for their sheep? Are we willing to chase them to the uttermost parts? &gt;&gt; Bring it on. Yes. &gt;&gt; Even when they're living in sin in a sodom condition, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing. Or do we just say, "Oh my, we don't want to get infected. We don't want to go anywhere near that." You know what? We're living in the midst of it. &gt;&gt; We can't help it. &gt;&gt; This condition that we're living in, this this age that we're living in is rampant with the Sodom and Gomorrah condition. &gt;&gt; It is absolutely rampant with it. And there's no escaping it. But verse 18, after the battle, after he went and slew the king, after he went and delivered his nephew, verse 18, and Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and he was priest of the most high God. And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heavens and earth." I just think, Lord, would you ever say that about me? Would you ever say those words about me? Could I ever fit that description? I just want to fit that description. Don't you today? &gt;&gt; And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth." You know, if you are elect of God, you do fit that description. &gt;&gt; We fit that description right there. We could put our name right there. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And he gave them tithes of all. He didn't give them tithes of some. There wasn't just a portion allocated. An exact to the penny mathematical formula calculated. &gt;&gt; No. No. It says he gave him tithes of all. &gt;&gt; All all of it because he knew where it came from. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where it came from. And I I just want to say if you ever want to see God bless you, just just just don't be tight with it. See what he does. &gt;&gt; He will always always bless you. Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 5 this morning talking about Melzdc. Hebrews chapter 5. talking about mazesc and the spirit of communion. Hebrews chapter 5 verse 6. as he saith also in another place, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc, who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. &gt;&gt; God called of God and high priest after the order of Melzdc. And we know what the order of Melzdc is. It's out without father, without mother, without beginning of days or ending of life where there's no descent. There's no tracing back the lineage of this man. Why is that? Because this man is not like any other man. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This man that we just read about is after the order of Melzdc. This man is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so I think it's so beautiful. I know brother Brandham refers to it in the message when Abram actually received that bread and that wine. Who was it that actually ministered that bread and that wine to him? Now, some would say there's no way that could be Jesus Christ. And I'm not going to say it was, but I am going to say it was Jesus Christ in spirit. I think it was though the same man that did it. I think it's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; We can see it. We know it. But we know in this scripture here that we're reading is speaking specifically about Jesus Christ. Verse six says, "As he saith in another place, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc." We know that Melzdc referring to in the story in Genesis verse 7 here who in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death. He wasn't about to die. That that one in Genesis and and he wasn't offering up strong prayers and tears because he feared that he was going to die. He wasn't actually a son that he needed to learn obedience by the things which he suffered. He was Melzdc. But this scripture here is speaking very specifically about Jesus Christ in the order of Melzdc. I think it's a beautiful beautiful thing when we look at this recognizing this is about communion. Though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And verse nine says, "And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him." So I was looking up this word perfect. It's G5048 pronounced tali u and it says to complete literally accomplish or figuratively consumate in character consecrate finish fulfill make perfect. I just want to throw in a word here, maybe a a an adjective for this word perfect. And yet and being yet made not perfect but yet perfect. Being made mature, being made adopted, being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. Called of God and high priest after the order of Melzdc. Just thinking about this man, Melzdc. Who is this man? Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 7. Hebrews chapter 7. Talks a bit about the scripture that we read this morning in Genesis. Hebrews chapter 7. We know this was a letter that Paul wrote to the Hebrews. For this Melzdc, verse one, being king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor ending of life, but being made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest continually. Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take the tithes of the people according to the law, that is of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham. I think it's so beautiful what he gets at here. But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises. And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the better. And here men that die receiveth tithes receive tithes. But there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. And as I may so say, Levi also who receiveth tithes paid tithes in Abraham. For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melzdc met him. &gt;&gt; If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for under it if the people received the law, what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melzdc and not be called after the order of Aaron? &gt;&gt; I think it's just amazing. I don't want to read any more in here. I'm not going to go further with it because it uh will just take us in another direction. But I think it's just amazing to look at this to recognize paying tithes is way more than simply what's in it for me. &gt;&gt; And when you see a ministry that's pulling on money continually, that's just a a it's not a good ministry either. That's not the ministry of the Lord. But to understand that when we pay a tithe unto the Lord and maybe it's of our time because I'm not pulling on money. Maybe it is of money. Maybe it's of something that we do. Maybe it's prayer. Whatever it is, when we pay a tithe, truly a tithe is of money. But when we do pay a tithe, we're not looking for a blessing for ourselves. What about for our children? &gt;&gt; What about for our children's children? Like Levi in the loins of Abraham. He paid tithes. How could he do that in the loins of Abraham? It's a beautiful thing. He's not in the in the lineage of man at that point. It is the elected of God that we're talking about. But when we pay tithes, we are actually seeing a blessing stored up in a different way than maybe what we can think about the way this world is set up to make us believe. You know, I I just want to read a quote out of perfection in 1956. Brother Brandham talking about this king of Salem, Melzdc. Who was the king of Salem? The great king of Jerusalem. Not the earthly, the heavenly. The earthly Jerusalem is a type of the heavenly. And here come the king of Salem, which is first the king of righteousness, the king of peace. He didn't have any father. He didn't have any mother. He didn't have beginning of life or ending of days. Oh my. Without disscent. None other than Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; That's who the church meets when they go up in the air. &gt;&gt; Now, I was studying this and I was just thinking about it. You know, that day is so close, brothers and sisters. Yes, &gt;&gt; that day is so close &gt;&gt; where that church, that group of people he's talking about are going to actually meet him in the clouds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has never been closer. &gt;&gt; All of the signs and and and situations are actually in play right now. And we know that this is so far beyond what the prophet taught when he said, "There's only one I only see one thing left for the church of the living God, and that is for the rapture." But he says that's who's that's who the church meets when they go up in the air, none other than Christ himself. And when Abraham met him, he gave him the tithe of all that he possessed. You know what they did? The first thing they did was sat down. He says, "I feel really emotional." sat down and broke bread and drank wine and taken the communion after the battle was over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here's what I want to get to today, brothers and sisters, when we're in the midst of our lives and we're in the midst of our battles because we all have them. Some are great, some are small. We have different perspectives on different things in our lives, but when we're going through it, we're going through it. And it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks because we're the ones experiencing it. When we're going through the battle, I just want to encourage us that it's when the battle is over. &gt;&gt; Melzdc is going to be there with you for communion. &gt;&gt; Melzdc himself is going to bring the wine and the bread and say, "It's over. You don't have to fight anymore. &gt;&gt; You have ran the course. You have finished the race. &gt;&gt; My But brother Brandham's saying this as he's talking here. You know what they did? The first thing they did was sat down. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this one who he's just said was none other than Jesus Christ. Sat down and broke bread and and poured out the wine. Can you imagine what kind of wine that must have been for all the wine connoisseurs in the congregation? And I know there's some people that drink wine for the stomach's sake. And you know, that's okay. It's a revelation. We drink wine for communion and that's about all. But you know, there's people that are huge wine connoisseurs. I can imagine this would be the best wine there ever was ever even thought about in the world because this was Jesus Christ offering it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, it might have been comparable, I guess, at the wedding feast, right? The first miracle of Jesus. It's probably the same same strain of wine. But you know what they did? The first thing they did was set down. He says, "I feel really emotional." And I just I personally can't help but think when you hear the prophet of God telling a story like this about something that actually took place, I just think that he must have been there. He must have witnessed it. He must have been able to visualize it through a vision, through the prophetic gift that he had. He was able to sat down and see this happen and and and sat down and see that the bread was broken and he drank the wine and took the communion. But it was after the battle was over. And the next paragraph says, "And the Bible tells us Jesus Christ did that we'll eat no more of the fruit of the vine until I eat a new with you in my father's kingdom." &gt;&gt; Amen. that when the last battle is fought and I want to say brothers and sisters just any day now the very last battle is going to be fought &gt;&gt; for the elected bride of Jesus Christ just any day now any moment now the very last battle is going to be fought in our lives let's not get weary in welloing let's fight hard while we have the ability through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to fight &gt;&gt; that when the last battle is fought and the victory is won &gt;&gt; I love how he says that not when the last battle's fought and you kind of lose and you go moping home. No, when the last battle is fought and won &gt;&gt; and the waywards has been brought back to the kingdom of God. Why? Because we'll travel to the ends of the earth to go chase our brothers and our sisters who have gone wayward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brown talks about it in a message. I believe it's in adoption. Don't worry about those weward children. You just commit them to God. God will do the work in their lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He goes on here to say that when the last battle is fought and the victory is won and the wayward's been brought back to the kingdom of God, we'll set down in the kingdom of God and with our Melzdc who has no beginning of days or ending of years. Oh my, he's the chainless eternal one. &gt;&gt; Eat the communion again with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I just want to say it. When we have communion tonight, this afternoon, whatever you want to call it, when we partake of the communion table, let's consider who is here with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking the communion. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which we ought to or we better not take communion, &gt;&gt; because if we don't, if we're not led by the spirit, going full circle to what we said at the beginning, we need the baptism of the Holy Spirit to be partaking of this body. If we're not doing that, then we're just doing it out of motion. We're going through the motions. And that's not the way to take it because we're supposed to discern the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say anyone does or doesn't. And I know some people will say you shouldn't let a child take communion before the age of 14 because it's not accountable. Or they probably be the same people that would say you should never let a child unless they're 16 years of age go and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins so that they can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Both of which the prophet of God never said. Right. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say where did they come from? &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know what? If we have a man's opinion, it's fine. I say my opinion many times, but it's like eating cherry pie. The prophet said, "If you're eating the pie and you're enjoying the pie and you get a pit, don't throw the pie out." &gt;&gt; Just throw the pit out. &gt;&gt; And and I would say just maybe what we could do is just politely take a napkin and just &gt;&gt; and there goes the pit, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to cough it out and make a big hairy deal about it, do we? &gt;&gt; No. Just take it out, put it down, and move on because we're brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; We're all sons and daughters of God. We're all going to the same place. We're all fighting the same enemy, aren't we? &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when we start fighting one another, we're giving the devil a day off. Who wants to give the devil a rest? &gt;&gt; Don't do his work. &gt;&gt; Let's work for the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, when we see these things, when we hear these things, where did they come from? &gt;&gt; If they didn't come from the prophet of God, if they didn't come from the word of God, then they're irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Even my opinion, &gt;&gt; it's irrelevant. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; But when it's according to the word of God, we better listen. &gt;&gt; You know, I just think this is so good how we talk about Melzdc, the the one Jesus Christ himself. We just heard the prophet say it. You know, he was beginning of no beginning of days and no ending of life. This one, this one had to come himself and suffer. I I just struggle with this myself to even comprehend it. He came to suffer. &gt;&gt; He came to do miracles. He came to have a first and second pole of his ministry and a third pole of his ministry, but then to be taken off the scene in such a way that he would pay the price for my salvation. He was tempted in all points, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; And he wasn't delivered from the temptation. What he did do was actually fought the temptation with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Only by the word of God. That's the only way that he overcame. We know in Matthew chapter 4 after he went through the temptation, you know, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. The three temptations that Satan came to him after he was hungered after 40 days of fasting. My verse 11 of Matthew chapter 4 says, "Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto him." &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the thought, brothers and sisters, once the battle is fought, once the battle is not just fought, but won. Once that battle is won, the angels will come and minister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They won't leave us or He won't leave us or forsake us. His angels are encamped about us. But we have to learn. If he had to come and learn things through the things that he suffered, are we going to be free? Are we going to be vacant of suffering in our lives? &gt;&gt; We're going to have to suffer. We were talking about it yesterday. What what it would be like to not actually appreciate the things that we're going through in this life, but yet go and meet those virgins that had to have their breast cut off and slowly bleed out until they fell over. or the ones that had the tar put in their hair for sport in the stadiums and then have their hair lit on fire and just burn like a human torch to death. Or the families that claim Christianity, they claim to believe the message of the hour. And we know that the Romans said, "If that's what you don't want to renounce, then we're going to have to feed you to the lions." the moms and the dads and the children, all of those ones that gave their lives. We're going to go and stand and face those and say, "Oh, no, no, no, no. I I I just couldn't go through the suffering that I had to go through, the thing that I had to endure. No, it was just too much for me to No, no, no. The example that we talked about yesterday was how people were tied to a log. They were tied to a log and they were hung upside down on the log so that wild dogs could eat their bellies. I'm not saying this to try and make us sick. I'm trying to say, brothers and sisters, we're not going to go through this life unless we suffer just like he suffered just like they suffered. &gt;&gt; What happens when we suffer is we fight a battle. &gt;&gt; And when we fight the battle, we got to remember when we're fighting the battle, the battle's already won. We just have to endure to the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not our battle. &gt;&gt; It's his battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he already won the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when the battle's over, just like Jesus, it's scriptural in Matthew 4:11. Then the devil leaveth him. There comes a time where the devil's going to leave us. &gt;&gt; There comes a time where the devil's going to leave us. And and and I know that I could say names for for brothers and sisters who have gone through it, really gone through it, where the devil has just been on us and it feels like we just can't escape it. And the Lord will allow it to be that way. Boy, because he has a character inside of us &gt;&gt; that he wants to bring out. &gt;&gt; And the only way that character is coming out is through the fiery trials in this life. But there's coming a time where the devil's going to leave us, &gt;&gt; just like it left Jesus. And how did that happen? He overcame by the word. &gt;&gt; And as long as we're doing it the way that he instructed us to do it, the devil's going to leave us. &gt;&gt; In Luke 4:13, and when the devil had ended all the temptation, the devil's going to end the temptation with us. Don't worry. Just keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; That was the the instruction the prophet got from all the voices that were on the other side. Just keep pressing on. When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. I just love this verse here. Verse 14 says, "And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee. He didn't come back defeated because he had been tempted and he was hungered and he had to go through all the trials. He came back in the power of the spirit &gt;&gt; after the trial." Amen. &gt;&gt; And there went out a fame of him &gt;&gt; throughout all the region round about. &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, I want to encourage us today if I can when we're going through the battle. If we can just stick with it. &gt;&gt; Don't get weary in welloing. Understand the battle already has been won. &gt;&gt; We're going through the battle because he wants us to learn obedience through the things that we suffer. the things just like he had to go through. But boy oh boy, I just love the thought just like Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee after the battle was fought, after the angels came and ministered to him. The same thing as for us, brothers and sisters, when we go through the battles, God is going to come and actually minister to us &gt;&gt; and and not just minister to us, but actually encourage us. We're going to have an encouragement because we're going to recognize we have allowed the Lord. We never did it. We just surrender to him to allow him to overcome whatever it is in our life that he wants us to overcome. Every one of us has something that we have to overcome. Every one of us has a punch coming from the devil. Don't we? That's what the prophet said. That's what God said through the prophet. Every one of us has a punch coming. I think it's amazing when we look at it because Jesus returned in the power of the spirit. I can't help but think we return in the power of the spirit after the battle has been fought. After the battle has been won. After we have communion in the spirit, communion through the spirit with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to say this that there went out a fame of him throughout the region all around roundabout. There will be and is a fame for all those who are actually battling the devil now &gt;&gt; going through the battles in their own lives. All of our individual walks where we're struggling and we feel like we're not overcoming. You know, as long as we're fighting, as long as there's a struggle, you're overcoming. It's when you give in and there's no more struggle. That's when we've got a problem. I'll never forget brother Menow saying it the first time I ever heard it. That brother that that that said, "I just keep struggling. I just keep feeling like I can't overcome. I can't escape this temptation in my life. And brother brother Menow, he said it the first time I heard it. He said, "Do you still have a desire?" And he said, "Yeah, I do." And he said, "Well, there you go. You've got a benchmark. You got a place to go from. &gt;&gt; If you didn't have a desire, it would be over." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if we're in the midst of a battle, if we're in the midst of a trial today, brothers and sisters, we need to count it. more more precious than gold is what the word says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we come through the battle and when we go through the trial, when we learn obedience through the things that we're suffering, just think the devils are hearing the fame of God's success in your life. The devils all around you are going to hear a fame through the region roundabout about you, about how God can have success through you in your life. I just think it's amazing because we can see how God will do that and the devil will back off. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because Satan's busy. He's he's he's busy. He's a busy guy. He's a busy person. Uh maybe not a human, but a busy being, we'll say, right? A fallen angel. That's what he is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he's busy. And so what does he do? He sends minions. He has people that he sends. And and can you think that if those minions keep coming around and keep not being able to win, keep not being able to have success? Well, they they were sent out to do send a temptation to to Benjamin Johnson. This temptation, I hope it's okay, buddy. This one thing that used to get him all the time. Suddenly, he just doesn't fall for it anymore. &gt;&gt; Those devils aren't going to want to come and bother him because they're not going to have success. &gt;&gt; They're going to go and talk about what's going on. Now suddenly Benjamin he's overcoming in such a way like maybe he never did before and there's going to be a fame that goes round about in another dimension. &gt;&gt; You know I want to read a quote this morning just uh talking about Melzdc and and this idea of communion and and communion it only happens through leadership. If we're not being led, if we're not willing to be led according to the word of God, we can have all the motions, go through all the motions in our lives, and we're still not going to have communion. &gt;&gt; We're going to say it. We're going to we're going to maybe talk about it, but it's not going to be true spiritual communion. But what I want to talk about is a real life account. And we can read this here. I'm going to read it in the last little bit. It's amazing how time flies when you're having fun. &gt;&gt; 1965. Who is this Melzdc? How many ever seen the picture of that light? It's all over the country. Everywhere science has took it and examined it and everywhere. Now he is right here now. And I just going to say this, brothers and sisters. He's no different today, is he? &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered together in his name, he's there. &gt;&gt; We've already declared that we're gathered together in his name. Many people I know will say, "We hear this all the time, Brother Barry. Why do we got to go down this road?" because we all have needs. And I want to try and encourage us to recognize that we have the ability to see the very same success of God in our midst as they did here. &gt;&gt; Even though we're talking about a vindicated prophet, but you know, brothers and sisters, if we just take it and put it off on a vindicated prophet and say that was only for the prophet, it's only going to be that way for the prophet, then we're missing the value, the entire value of the message of the hour. Because the entire message of the hour didn't come for the prophet. It came to the prophet &gt;&gt; for the bride. &gt;&gt; So if we're the bride, then we are the full recipients of it. And if this is what was going on through the vindicated prophet, what ought to be going on through the bride today? &gt;&gt; My he says science has took it and examined it everywhere. And now he's right here. Now I say the only difference between us and the vindicated prophet is he had the ability to see that light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that light is either here right now or it's not. &gt;&gt; It's one or the other. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now he's right here now. Same one that said about marriage and divorce. Same one that was on the mountain, shook the hills back there. Same one that's down here at the river in 33. Same yesterday, today, and forever. He says it. He's the same. &gt;&gt; So, brothers and sisters, either he is or he isn't the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I just felt so encouraged to get into this as I was feeling the desire to talk about the the communion that Melzdc brought Abraham and how it was only after the battle that he fought. You know, brothers and sisters, this might sound a little bit silly and some might remember me talking about this, but brother Pete Clawson was actually here in this meeting, right here in this meeting with William Brham. and and he would tell this story in such a vibrant way. And I know there was other brothers there. I think brother Mana was there. Brother George was there. I don't know the other brothers that were there, but there was other brothers and they were there. They they they just had this experience where they wanted to see the prophet of God. They were going for this series. They drove all the way to Jeffersonville from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. And and here they were. They thought that the services weren't starting till the next day. And come to find out, the services were already on. And and what happened was they went to check it out in the door and it was full. And one of the deacons said, "We can actually get you in. You can go and sit right up near the front, but when we closed the meeting, you have to get up and leave right away because you're going to be in the emergency exit." And they said, "Okay." And they wound up getting right near the front row of this meeting, this meeting. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc? And now I I just remember brother Pete Clawson describing this. Now there is a woman and she recognizes now that something has happened. So as I read this I just want to say brothers and sisters who was speaking &gt;&gt; who was it that was speaking these words? &gt;&gt; There was a man there was a voice but what was the sign behind the voice? Oh my. What was the voice behind the sign? Now there is a woman and she recognizes now that something has happened. That light is hanging right over her. She's sitting right here, green sweater on or something. I don't know the woman. I suppose we are strangers to one another. Is that right? Do you believe that God? you're in the need of something and you can believe that can and you believe that God can reveal to me what your trouble is and if he does then you'll know it'll have to be supernatural power because I don't know you and it'll have to come through supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when brother Pete was here, he would tell this story about how he could see that woman &gt;&gt; wearing the green sweater. He could see the prophet talking about this and he had to wonder who was it that was speaking those words. Now he goes on to say depends upon what you think it is. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I want to take this story and bring it right up out of history and bring it right here today to Calvary Living Word Assembly for every single one of us in this building to contemplate. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this just a historical event? Depends on what you think. &gt;&gt; Is it going to be somewhere out in the future? Depends on what you think. Is he here today the same yesterday, today, and forever? Depends on what you think. &gt;&gt; Depends on what you think it is. You can take your side with the priest, call it the devil &gt;&gt; or brother Barry. &gt;&gt; Or you can take the side with the believer and call it God. &gt;&gt; Whatever which you believe, that's where your reward will come from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe this is a fridge sticker quote. &gt;&gt; Depends on what you think it is. &gt;&gt; That's where your reward will come from. My goodness, help me to have the right perspective, Lord. If God will reveal to me your trouble, will you accept him as your atonement for that trouble? &gt;&gt; I want to say it this morning. If you have trouble, &gt;&gt; will you accept him as his atonement for your troubles? &gt;&gt; Because if you will, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Depends on what we think about it, though, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Let's have the right mental attitude to any one of the promises of God. Because what will happen? &gt;&gt; It'll bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He says, "If God will reveal to me your trouble, will you accept him as your atonement for your trouble? I don't know what the trouble is, but I know and you know that something is going on. I think that's so beautiful. Imagine what that must have been like to be there witnessing that. But imagine what it's like right now witnessing it here in our midst. I'm not interested in just leaving it back there. And I don't want to put it off in the future. I don't want to be guilty of what the prophet said, looking back to what God has done, looking forward to what he's going to do, and ignoring what he's doing right now in this service. &gt;&gt; If we've got trouble, what are we thinking about it? &gt;&gt; Now, just let me tell you how you're feeling. Who says those words? That's just let me tell you how you're feeling and then you'll know. A real warm, sweet, comfortable feeling. I'm looking right straight at it. It's that light, amber light hanging from the woman. And I want to say today, I I can't tell you that I can see an amber light hanging from anybody. I I can't see it, but I just take him at his word. His word says that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He took 39 stripes for our healing. He is our deliverer. He is our comforter. He is our strength. &gt;&gt; I just want to take him at his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "And the lady is suffering with a trouble in her stomach. It's kind of a growth like in her stomach. She is not from here." No, you you're from away. You're you you're you're you're from away from here, aren't you? That's right. You're from Wisconsin. Is that right? Sure. Now you are healed. Your faith has made you whole. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now tell me who the woman touched. &gt;&gt; Because you know I remember brother Pete Clawson saying that she never touched brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; They never touched. &gt;&gt; It was simply words. It was speaking. So who did she touch? Who was it that she touched? &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing brothers and sisters. We have the ability to touch &gt;&gt; Melzdc. &gt;&gt; The priest of the most high God. The one who actually is our atonement. &gt;&gt; The one who is actually here in our midst today. &gt;&gt; Who wants to deliver us from whatever the problem is, whatever the trouble is in our life. &gt;&gt; But it depends on what we think about it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to call the musicians this morning. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, our thinking has everything to do with it. &gt;&gt; Is it fanaticism? &gt;&gt; Is it just a a crank? Is it just a cult or is it truly the vindication of the word of God to the age in which we live? Is it truly the manifestation of the Revelations 10 1-7? If it truly is that, then what about 8 to 11 &gt;&gt; or 8-13? The latter part of that scripture, take that book and eat it up. Don't just leave it. take it and make it your own. &gt;&gt; But what we think about it, that's what we're going to get. &gt;&gt; I love how he says that. I'm going to go back to what he says here. Depends on what you think it is, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. This could be just an ordinary service for us today. &gt;&gt; It depends on what you think it is. &gt;&gt; It could be the greatest service of our lives. &gt;&gt; It depends on what we think it is. Tonight when we come and partake of the communion, it could be the greatest service of our life. &gt;&gt; It depends on what we think it is. &gt;&gt; You can take your side with the priest, call it the devil, call it a cult, call it whatever you want. Or you can take the side with the believer and call it God. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me this morning as we close. Ever which you believe, that's where your reward will come from. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say, God, richly bless you today. &gt;&gt; As we close, let's bow in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful Lord that you have given us your word. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you've given us two roads that we can travel. &gt;&gt; Father, one by sight or one by faith. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, not to look at the natural, &gt;&gt; oh Father, but to look at the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. to look at the the word that you've given us in the day in which we live, Lord. To know that, Father, there's so much more for us, Lord. We're not looking for signs and wonders, but we are we are fully aware of who you have called us to be. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, many times even we would say that we're fully aware. Maybe we don't have a full consciousness. Maybe we just don't fully realize or comprehend it. And and if that's the case, Lord, I pray that you would help us, Lord, because we know that you said through your prophet that when the church recognizes what it is, then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Father, we have many desires in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many needs, many situations and circumstances. Oh, Father, but there's nothing greater than that marriage supper of the lamb. Father, being able to, like we read about earlier today, to meet you in the clouds, &gt;&gt; Father, to know that we will not hinder those that went ahead of us and sleep, Father. But in the moment, in a twinkling of an eye, they'll go first and we will be together with you in the clouds forever. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just take the words that were spoken today, Father, and just allow them, Lord Jesus, to nourish our souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, I pray that you would help us, Lord, to adjust our thinking, not to our own ways, Father. Not to a a a scientific thinking, not to a a critical way of thinking according to this world. Oh, Father, according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Help us, Lord. Forgive us, Lord Jesus. Help us to look at it through your eyes, Lord Jesus. Through the tree of life. Help us, Lord Jesus, to see it the way that you have created it, the way that you have written it, the way that you have delivered it. Father, help us just accept it the way that you have done it. And Father, just yield ourselves to it. We pray that you would bless your children today. Be with those who couldn't be here. Father, there's so many that are away. Some are traveling. Some might be sick. Oh, Father, maybe some are hurting. We pray that you would be with them wherever they are, whatever they're doing, Lord Jesus, that you would minister to them, Father. Strengthen them and encourage them. I pray. And Father, if it be your will for us to meet again here tonight, Lord, to discern your body. Help us not to wait till tonight to discern your body. But let us get after it right now, Lord, &gt;&gt; as we go forwards. Father, tonight we'll be careful to give you all the praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? The winds of faith. [Music] &gt;&gt; There are two roads you may take. One by sight, one by three faith. Take the word of God or what you see. What you believe is what will be. Set your wings to the winds of faith.
