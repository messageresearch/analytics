as we go to him gracious Heavenly Father tonight we thank you that we can gather together in your name father that we can come into your house Lord and gather in your name to worship you father Hallelujah that's our main desire and that's our main goal father because we know that if we put you first Lord that everything else will fall into Line Tonight Lord Jesus we just want to ask father that you would meet these requests made known unto you tonight by way of an uplift hand father we know that you've created us to be needy and father every single one of us need you every single hour of every single day Lord Jesus father there's not one day that goes by that we can't father come to you and just plead our case Lord we're so thankful for what you've done as our brother prayed already Lord every single one of us Lord to have breath in our lungs Lord Jesus to be able to move around and to think and Lord Jesus to talk and to see father all the gifts that you've given us but

Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians certainly welcome everyone to the house of the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to continue in our study of the exposition of the seven Church AG ages and uh our position right now in the pergami and church age but if we can turn in our Bibles to Revelations chapter 2 we'll continue reading about the pergami and church age Revelations chapter 2 verse 8 says and unto the angel of the church uh sorry I've got this wrong my goodness it's ch chapter 2 verse2 and unto the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where an antipast was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for those of us who have an ear to hear what your spirit sayth father we pray that if there's anyone that doesn't have an ear to hear what your spirit saith that Lord you would just give them an ear and father we know that your Prophet said that sometimes people don't have the ability to hear only because a devil has tied that nerve and tonight Lord Jesus we pray that if anyone has that nerve Tied by a devil we just pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you would loose that nerve that we could rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that father we would be able to hear and speak this word we love you and we thank you we commit every single person now into your care in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated i' just like to have a couple of announcements here we have brother Andrew Glover here this week weekend we've been planning on it for a year and uh just uh excited about it I'm thinking we'll continue to do this and uh hopefully next year as well I'm not sure of the exact date next year we'll work that out with brother Andrew in the in the coming months I'm sure but uh he's from blackburg Virginia and uh he's an evangelist and he can sure preach the word and we just want to give him the opportunity to minister to us so we're going to have a service Friday night at 7:30 Saturday at 6:00 and Sunday at 10:00 we'll have a potluck at our house on Sunday as well uh from 2:00 onwards and we'll just see where the the fellowship will take us and uh I do apologize if I hadn't announced that I know I haven't announced the potluck um sooner but I know everyone is traveling and we all have plans so there's no worries if you are traveling you're going to be out of town it's okay we'll have more potluck and fellowship um I trust the Lord is uh pleased with the weekend we have brother Jos n AFU he will be here on August the 25th we are going to go to the family camp at Moose Lake so uh brother Jos has agreed to take the service and certainly thankful for his willingness to step up and help are you happy tonight certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus I certainly would like to make an announce ment tonight as well uh I will on Sunday also but uh sister Rosie panicker has come back to visit us again and this time I understand she's here for quite a while she has been given I think a fiveyear visas I understand so she'll be here but this time she did not come empty-handed not like she ever has come empty-handed I don't mean it that way but she brought her family with her this time and not just to visit but to stay what a blessing so we want to welcome brother John and sister namita paner and all of their children sister Anna John sister amanna John Sister Sarah John Brother Joseph John brother Benjamin baselo John sister Aliyah John and brother Jeremiah John panicker I hope I got that right welcome everyone amen welcome brother John you know one of the first things that brother John said to me which was such an encouragement I hope it's okay we're just a big family here brother first thing he said to me was you know we're here to stay but uh what can we do to help the assembly not just me and my wife but the whole family what can we do to put our shoulder to the wheel and I just said welcome brother we'll find a spot for you just settle in and uh shake some hands and we trust that you feel right at home but just just amazing to hear and uh a real blessing I'm sure will be to the to the body I I trust you all feel right at home just want to carry on in our study here with the exposition of the seven Church ages I will announce you on the weekend as well brother so I hope it's okay there's people that are away that uh definitely need to hear and I'm sure they will uh through the streaming but uh it's just a little bit better in person you know uh talking about the exposition of the seven Church ages and uh dealing with the pergami and church age there's just so much in here that we have talked about in the past I'm not going to go too far back tonight but brother Bram he talks about the different portions of the scripture in in the message to the pergami and church age and you know we last week we talked about how Christ eulogizes the church and the eulogy is like the last word the description of this church age and how this church age was dying and the reason is because they had those that held to the doctrine of balum and and that was to to look at the hinder parts of the people to cause them to fall to stumble throw stumbling blocks in front of people the the next one is that we know that they had uh they they held to the doctrine of the nians which is what we're going to talk about tonight in uh in a great way it's actually quite technical the way brother bradam gets into it but it's it's so important to know that the doctrine of the nicians is to conquer the the congregation the the the the the ministry to to do something to actually hold down the the Believers and that's so opposite of what the prophet in our day taught what the Lord brought to us and that is to bring everyone to know that that they are truly the Sons and Daughters of God and I don't have the quote tonight but brother Bram said it I did not come to actually create a church I did not come to create a following I came to encourage people to recognize that they are the PowerHouse of the Holy Ghost amen that they're the ones that have the power I think it's just such a beautiful thing he goes on to talk about thou holdest fast my name thou Hast not denied my faith and that's really where I want to get into I'm going to pick up from paragraph 101 thou Hast not denied my faith and and I think if we had to title it tonight which I don't really want to I just want to continue on with the the numerical um titles but uh thou Hast not denied my faith it's not my faith it's not Calgary living word's Faith it's not the Deacon's Faith it's not anybody's Faith it's not even brother bram's Faith brothers and sisters that's right it's the faith of God it's not the faith in God it's the faith of God and that's what brother bam talks about here this is where it gets really good I I just think it's it's so beautiful thou Hast not denied my faith that was the group of people in this church age they did not deny his faith and they were able to stand they were able to be where Satan is at and brother bam talks about it here it's so beautiful what what they did was they spoiled Satan's Dominion they spoiled Satan's garden and I just couldn't help but think when we were when I was studying this how that's exactly what's going on right now and that's why he's roaring that's why he's going around causing so many problems cuz he knows his time is short but as long as Grace is still on the earth here as long as the Bride of Jesus Christ is still here he's got a little bit of time so he is working over time to come up with distractions and we talked about it on Sunday maybe it's the music maybe it's the temperature maybe it's this maybe it's that maybe it's the other thing anything to keep us distracted from coming to the realization of who we really are we really are the manifestation of the word for our age for our day but thou Hast not denied my faith paragraph 101 in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his jesus' name through faith in his Jesus name hath made this man former strong yay the faith which is by from him Jesus hath given him the the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all how many people have been spiritually crippled but have been given spiritual soundness am why see there it is Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle Peter didn't say stand up and walk in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy ghost he didn't do that Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith anymore than he claimed that it was his own name but here in this age sometimes people maybe they didn't claim that it was in their name and maybe sometimes we see Ministry that don't claim that it's in their name but people want to get people to Ministry where they see the gifts manifest don't they and what happens is if that person doesn't actually knock that down and say it's not me it's not my Ministry it's Christ's Ministry don't try and put me in that position because if you do that God will knock me down so that you won't look at me right it's got to be Jesus Christ amen jesus' name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was in his own human Faith anymore than he claimed that it was his in in that it was his own name he said that jesus' name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelations 2:13 it was his Capital H faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers and brothers and sisters that's where we need to be tonight amen don't look at your own faith I mean sometimes when we're children we grow we toddle we fall we we need to grow and mature we we need to go through things in our lives we don't come out of the womb as an adult we have to grow and the same thing is spiritually spiritually we need to grow and we need to mature we need to learn we need to be able to make mistakes we need room to make mistakes and to correct them amen but when we do receive the correction do we do that's the proof of who we are and the more mature we get the more willing we're going to be able to receive correction and the more we receive correction the more we grow the more we have the ability to do that but when we have pride in the way and we say no no no no no I'm good I don't have any room for correction in my life I know the message of the hour he can't help us and you know what I'll say is it's not his faith that's in us when we're that way because his faith will always go back to the word his faith will always align up with the word amen but when we have his faith it's the next level it's not us anymore according as God hath dwelt to every man according to verse one the men are Brethren The Measure of Faith that's Romans 123b the second half of that verse in Ephesians 2:8 by grace are you saved through faith and that faith not of yourselves it wasn't earned it was the gift of God it wasn't something that was given to us from tenure because we've been in the message for 40 years or 30 years or 20 years it's because God gave it to us because we were given that gift James 2 verse1 and it also says in James 2:1 my brethren notice he too is talking to Brethren have not the faith of not in our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with the respect of persons no we're not going to make a a special place for the special people we're going to Simply say that we're all Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith yes the ones that know the Christ they they've had a relationship with him personally yes amen and you know I I threw this in last week I'm going to bring it again 1 Peter 1 ver8 whom have not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith amen there is a Time brothers and sisters where we receive the end of our faith and that's where it becomes the next level that's where we shift out of the the last gear that we were in into the next gear where we can say I can't rationally see it I I don't understand it humanly speaking how this is going to turn out right how this situation is going to happen I cannot ask 1+ 2 and get three that's not going to happen in this situation I have to just set aside all of my rational thinking and trust in the Lord with all of my heart and lean not into my own understanding but in all of my ways including this one that I can't fix on my own acknowledge him because he will direct my path then but receiving the end of our faith even the salvation of our souls amen many times we can say I'm saved I know I'm saved but don't know about the situation brother bradam says we need to know about that situation we need to be able to claim that situation whatever it is whether it's our healing whether it's our finances whether it's our marriage whether it's our children Whatever It Is by faith we need to be able to claim that and say it is even though Naturally Speaking we can look at it and say oh it isn't no it isn't no it's not naturally speaking it's not and many times it's not naturally speaking but that's exactly where the devil likes to get us and and make us Shake in our faith and when it's our faith we will shake but when it's his faith brother bam talks about it the shoulders go back and the chest comes out and he says no shut up when the devil starts saying no it can't turn out right it's not going to work God doesn't hear your prayers his faith says shut up I don't need to listen to that because the word of God says that yes indeed he he he will heal my body yes indeed he will seal my soul yes indeed we will raise up again at the end we don't have to be afraid of death but it's it's our faith the ending of our faith receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you and me thank you Lord you know I just took a look at this word end there's there's there's a lot in there that I'd like to really examine but I just thought the end what is the end receiving the end of our faith what is the end of our faith well in uh in uh uh strongs concordance Telos g556 is uh Telos and it says to set out for a definite point or goal the end of our faith receiving the end of our faith properly the point aimed at as a limit there's going to be a limit to how far our faith will bring us just like children they need their parents to be the Holy Ghost for them because they don't receive the Holy Ghost right away they need to grow they need to mature they need to be taught in the way they should go raised up in the way trained up in the way they should go so that the word won't depart from them but in the meantime someone has to be there as their covering somebody needs to be in standing in the gap for them but there comes a point in time where they reach that point of accountability and when they reach that point accountability now the parents have to take their hands off and say they're on their own it's up to the Lord to actually lead them now amen but when they're trained up in the way they should go they will understand what that means and that's why we need to make sure that we're teaching properly but there comes a point where there's a limit there's a point where the end goal happens and and it goes on to say here on this Telos g556 the conclusion of an act or a state termination literally or figuratively of indefinitely the result immediate ultimate or prophetic purpose excuse me especially an impost or Levy as paid I just think that's beautiful the the end of our faith it's been paid for continual custom end our faith can be a continual custom we spoke a little bit about that on Sunday our faith but there comes a point where there's a goal where there's going to be an ending of our faith when it's his faith that comes into our lives especially an impost or Levy as paid continual custom and finally and uttermost I I just thought that was so good one word the word end has has such a big definition in the Hebrew text and and it's just wonderful thing to look at it sometimes in a little bit of a different way just expound upon one thing there's coming a Time brothers and sisters where we have to receive the end of our faith and when we receive the end of our faith then it takes us to the next level it gives us the ability to just trust in the Lord and and if you've ever done it you understand exactly what I'm talking about where you just can't see how the two ends are going to come together it's just not going to going to work out but somehow some way it does that's God and that's the exactly what he wants that's the way he wants it to be for us in our lives so that we're trusting him paragraph 102 in this pergan age where men were humanizing salvation humanizing salvation and remember brother Bram says that each and every age carries over into the next age this isn't necessarily just about the pergan church age this can be about the leodan age this can be about how in The Message Church age people are humanizing salvation and saying that if it doesn't happen a certain way which not necessarily lines up with the word of God then it's not the right way make sure it lines up with the word of God it has to am in the pergam in this peramine age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord and having cast aside the doctrine of election and open wide the church door and their Fellowship to any and all who subscribed to their tenants never mind the word remember one word off brothers and sisters does all that one word off opens that door wide just like we just read in this age of Rapid de degradation there were still a few who had the measure of that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only used that faith in Acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church I just love this this this is it right here paragraph 103 they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus himself that personal relationship that new birth that we heard about how she actually goes on to know him personally amen and then there's a new birth it's a relationship as today's church is filled with mental Believers I say Lord help us amen don't be a mental believer don't don't be a traditional believer who Endor the Virgin birth the shed blood going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human Faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now we can't just have an understanding we can't just have a mental conception of this it has to be revealed by the Holy Ghost amen and how's that going to happen outside of receiving the Holy Ghost it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands amen it's not about joining a church it's not about tenure in a church it's not about a family tradition there's no such thing as the prophet taught about Apostolic succession God doesn't have grandchildren we can't say because Mom and Dad serve God and they have a mighty God in their life that I'm saved and I don't have to come the same way they did every one of us has to be repent die out to ourselves be baptized ized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins and then what happens we just read it here receive the Lord Of Glory not some inanimate Spirit that's called the holy ghost or the Holy Spirit that's put out there as one of the three persons it's himself the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands boy that gets me going I love that this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by the faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian Victory and that's no different for every one of us we've got to keep living in that same Faith amen it has to be that exact same Faith living out through us no they had not denied that salvation was Supernatural from start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name and his faith and they were blessed by the Lord and accounted worthy of him this next paragraph here is interesting I haven't studied it out in in great detail and I don't know how much there is on it but antip pass my faithful martyr brother bam he says there's no other record in the word or in any profane history concerning this brother but surely there need not be it is more than enough that he was forn and and known of the Lord amen it is more than enough to see his faithfulness unto the Lord recorded in the Living Word he was a Christian he had the name of Jesus he had the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and he was amongst those who lived by it now I could be wrong here but this just conjures up the thought even of how the word will actually just mention a a quick blurb about an individual and it just made me think about that one there was a prostitute that understood that that they called Jesus to that Feast over at Simon's house and and they called him and said you know let's see a a mighty sign or a Wonder let's have a a dinnertime show with this Jesus this this this Messiah that they have in the land and and how they wanted to mock him and they they welcomed him without actually anointing him with oil without washing his feet without greeting him with a kiss all of the things they're supposed to do and and this prostitute is the one that was able to do that that was able to recognize it a prostitute off the street took the money that she earned through her living came bought this oil and anointed him for burial she recognized him and washed him with her feet gave him all that he needed a prostitute did and what did the word say Jesus said this name this woman will be mentioned throughout history all the way to the end of the world This Woman's name she will be mentioned and I don't know if it says her name but this woman and what she did for him what a tremendous thing it is sometimes we don't have to do very much and the Lord acknowledges us brothers and sisters that's my point paragraph 107 he had responded to the words of James have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with the respect of persons full of the Holy Ghost and Faith as was Stephen he respected no one he feared no one and when death was pronounced upon all who would take that name and walk in the faith of Jesus Christ he took his stand with those who had not turned back yes he died but like Abel he obtained a witness from God his name is written in the word and though dead his voice his voice still speaks in the pages of God's Divine record what a tremendous thought another faithful martyr was carried to his rest but Satan did not Triumph then even as he did not Triumph when he killed the Prince of Peace for as Satan was despoiled at the cross even so now will the blood of Antipas cry out to hundreds more who will take up their crosses and follow him amen amen where Satan's seat is paragraph 108 the reason that this is part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave Soldiers of the Cross were overcoming Satan right in the midst of his own throne room and you know that's not just exclusive to them brothers and sisters every single time we come to church and we show whose side we're on every single time we go on our knees and we speak to the Lord just oneon-one every single time we worship the Lord every single time we speak his name as Believers of this message of the hour we are the exact same we are overcoming Satan right in the midst of his own throne room this here is Satan's Eden but God has come to take a bride of his own choosing and I believe he has called her they were winning the battle through the name and Faith of Jesus right in the camp of the leaders of Darkness what a tremendous Commendation like the Mighty Man of David who invaded the camp of the enemy to bring David thirst quenching water oh my I have this highlighted here so these Giants so I want to say tonight brothers and sisters don't just make this a book of History make this a book about us amen let's look at this and recognize that these Giants that we're speaking about are the spiritual ones that actually receive the word of their day and not only just receive it by receiving it become it amen and when we become it we manifest it so these Giants of Faith invaded the realm of Satan's Earthly stronghold and by preaching Ing and exhorting brought the water of Salvation to those who lived under the shadow of death amen I know I lived under the shadow of death maybe that's why it gets me excited I know what it means to live under the shadow of death to actually come out of the shadow of death and get into the light of the s o n and when that happens brothers and sisters it's the next level it's something different amen now as much as these words concerning the throne and Realm Of Satan are a part of God's praise for his elect they actually set the stage for the denouncement of the evil that has gained Supremacy in the church pergamus Satan's Throne dwelling throne and dwelling place to many these phrases have been merely pictorial rather than truly historical but they are surely real and history bears that out pergamus was indeed the throne and Dwelling Place of Satan it happened on this wise pergamus was not original the place where Satan as concerning human Affairs dwelt Babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters it was in the city of Babylon that satanic worship had its origin now we have Genesis 11 verse 1-9 and Kush begot Nimrod and began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his King kingdom was Babel and Eric and aad and Kel and the land of shinar Genesis 10 8 8 to 10 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go too let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for Mortar and they said go too let us build us a SI a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroo the abroad upon the face of the earth I heard it said the reason they did this the reason they had this inspiration was because of the flood they never wanted to be drowned out by the flood they wanted to actually overcome the flood water so let's build a tower that we can run ourselves into and never have to deal with the wrath of God again what a terrible thing that is and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this be they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do can you imagine that nothing will be restrained from them go to let us go down and therefore confound their language so that they may not understand one another's spech speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel which the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth Babel or Babel is the original name for Babylon it means confusion it was literally started by Kush the son of ham and we know who ham was ham was the one that mocked his daddy Noah we'll get into that a little bit later Lord willing uh but it was brought to a kingdom of power and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the Genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so Monumental that all the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all the world governments excuse me that religion gained prominence is Pro proven by the fact that scripture identifies it with Satan completely in Isaiah 14 and in Revelations chter 17 and 18 and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry my and the theme of Mythology through the names of the god though the names of the Gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on until Jesus reveals himself to his Brethren that's the two witnesses in Israel he will be woried and honored though under a different name from Nimrod and in the temple slightly different from the one which was originally adored since the Bible does not deal in the histories of other nations in detail it will be necessary to search the Ancient Ancient profane records to find our answer as to how pergamus became the seat of satanic religion of Babylon the major sources of information will be the records of Egyptian and Grecian culture the reason for this is that Egypt received her Science and Mathematics from the caldan and in turn Greece received them from Egypt now since the priests were in charge of teaching teaching these sciences and since these Sciences were used as a part of religion we already know the key as to how the babylonish religion gained its strength in these two countries it is also true that where whenever a nation was able to overcome another nation in due time the religion of the subduer became the religion of the subdued it is well known that the Greeks had the very same signs of the zodiac as did the Babylonians and it has been found in the ancient Egyptian records that the Egyptians gave the Greeks their knowledge of polytheism thus the mysteries of Babylon spread from Nation to Nation until it appeared in Rome in China India and even in both North and South America we find the very same same basic worship amen these ancient histories agree with the Bible that this babylonish religion was most certainly not the original religion of the Earth's peoples it was the first to drift away from the original faith my but it was not itself the original one historians such as Wilkinson and mallet have proven conclusively from the ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one God Supreme Eternal Invisible by whom the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving good and just excuse me but Satan will always corrupt whatever he can we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the truth as he has always attempted to receive worship as though he were God and not the servant and creation of God remember that when you're dealing with Satan when he comes around and tempts you just remind him that he is a servant and creation I mean he used to be a servant he is now a servant he's actually used as a tool in the hand of God to bring to pass God's will but when Satan comes around to tempt you don't don't think about him being co-equal with God and having some great position beside God the only thing he has is the ability to come and try and accuse the Brethren Before the Throne that's the only thing he can do but we know we have Jesus Christ standing there interceding for the Saints but he is a servant and creation of God I just like to dwell on these things once in a while just to remind him just to put him in his place to remind us that he is a servant we're not a servant with with the bride of Jesus Christ he drew worship away from God to the end that he might draw it unto himself and so be exalted he certainly did accomplish his desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world this is auth authenticated by God in the Book of Romans when they knew God they glorified him not as God until they became vain in their imaginations and through darkness of heart accepted a corrupted religion to the extent that they worshiped creatures and not the Creator I remember hearing about this quite early on when I first started coming around the message how that is exactly what's going on today you can see it all over the place the creatures are being worshiped way more than the Creator what a terrible thing remember Satan was a creature of God Son of the morning thus we find that where once truth was disseminated amongst men and all held to that one truth there later came a day when a vast group turned from God and spread a diabolical form of worship around the world around the world my history Bears it out that those of the tribe of Shem that stood with the unchanging truth were in solid opposition to those of ham who turned away from the truth to the devil's lie there is no time to engage in a discussion of this it is merely introduced that you may see there were two religions and two only and the evil one became worldwide I love how he just takes it right back to the beginning hey monotheism turned to polytheism in Babylon the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City Satan truly became the God of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped causing them to believe that he was truly the Lord you know we talked about it on Sunday that uh really it's what's in the heart of the individual brother brandom says that there will be millions and billions of impersonators of Christianity in this age yes at the End of Time millions and billions of people and you know it's not up to us to put people in or take people out we know where we stand when we're worshiping we know exactly where we stand when we're worshiping and and and it's important for us to know where we stand when we're worshiping but if we've got the right heart then God is going to receive our worship and and I'll say this too and I might be going a little bit far and I I just think it's important to to bring a balance to it all in the midst of those millions and billions of impersonators of Christianity there's going to be people that truly are Christians yes they just haven't heard about this truth that we have heard about but they still Worship in spirit and in truth the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with a trinitarian Doctrine it was way back there in Antiquity that the one God in three persons idea came into existence how strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this how strange but evidently just as duped by Satan as their for forbears were they still believe in three persons of the godhead let us be shown just one place in scripture where there is any Authority for that Doctrine people are willing to accept a tradition they really are we were having this discussion recently I thought it was astounding really you know when you look at the story of John the Baptist there came a time where there was a corner turned right in in the scriptures Jesus himself God came and manifested the word before all mankind he came and John the Baptist said hey don't follow me follow him I'm not worthy to actually lose the the shoelaces on this man he is the one this is the one follow him stop following me but people still want to follow John yes sir right where I'm going with that is even today right today people are still following the teachings of John the Baptist we need to get into Christ amen how strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this but evidently just as duped by Satan as their forebears were they still believe in the three persons of the godhead let us be shown just one place in scripture where there is any Authority for that Doctrine and that is really the the the final the final Act to that discussion when you have it with someone let's see it in the Bible the Great Commission all the disciples they knew who that was Sir they knew exactly who that was they recognized his voice it was the Lord Jesus Christ is it not strange that while the descendants of ham were on their way in satanic worship which involved basic a basic concept of three gods that there is not one trace of the descendants of Shem believing such a thing or having any ceremonial worship that involved even a type of it it is not strange it is not strange that the Hebrews believed here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one God if there were three persons in the godhead Abraham the descendant of Shem in Genesis 18 saw one God with two angels and we know that's where Abraham was on The Plains of mamory in the door of his tent In the Heat of the day we know the story three men appeared but Abraham said Lord and we know that lot recognized the two men that went down to Sodom and called them Lords now paragraph 123 now how was this Trinity expressed it was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as it is expressed in Rome today strange the Hebrews did not H have such a concept now who is right is it the Hebrews or the Babylonians in Asia the polytheistic idea of three gods in one came out in an image with three heads on one body I'm going to get some visual aids for this I'm going to be dwelling on this a little bit I think it's really important to recognize this is this isn't just print on a page he's actually talking about I'm sure that we all understand this it's it's it's very real uh in Asia the polytheistic idea of three gods in one came in the image of three Gods three heads on one body sorry he is expressed as three intelligences and that is in Asia in India they found it in their hearts to express him as one God in three forms now that really is good modern day theology in Japan there is a great Buddha with three heads like the one we previously described but the most revealing of all is that which sets forth the trinity Arian concept of God in a Triune form of one the head of a old man symbolizing God the Father to a circle which in the Mysteries signified seed which in turn means the sun three the wings and tail of a bird a dove here was the doctrine of the Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in the godhead a veritable Trinity you can see the same thing in Rome and you can if you do go to I think it's St Peter's Basilica is that right up behind the altar way up there you can see what was just described and in the center of it is actually a dove and and it's to represent the Holy Spirit brother Bram says now let me ask once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshippers actually had more truth revealed than the faith than the father of Faith Abraham and his descendants is it not strange that the worshippers of Satan knew more about God than the children of God it's incredible when you think about this now what now what is now what is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about Trinity just remember this one thing from now on these these records are facts and this is a fact Satan is a liar and the father of lies and whenever he comes with any light it is still a lie he is a murderer and his doctrine of the Trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until Jesus comes amen another place in in the message I believe brother Bram says that the the doctrine of the Trinity is is from hell it's terrible because it's tricking people and and that's that's really what the devil does he he just tricks people he deceives people and you know forgive me for even saying this but one of the one of the most popular rock and roll songs of all times unfortunately I I listen to that stuff one of the most influential songs was written by The Rolling Stones and it's called Sympathy for the Devil and and one of the lyrics in the song is pleased to meet you hope you guess my name it it's a terrible thing but that's exactly what's happened and we can look at that and say well that's the Raging devil monster but what about when it gets into Christianity that's where it becomes treacherous because people genuinely think they're serving God and that's where worship becomes really important we need to know exactly where we stand when we're worshiping amen goes on to say according to history it did not take long for a change to be made in this concept of a father and a Son and the Holy Ghost Satan took them a step at a time away from the truth the evolved concept of deity was now one the Eternal Father two the spirit of God incarnate in a human mother wow does that make you think it makes me think a divine son the fruit of that Incarnation woman's seed paragraph 128 but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way and he's not going to settle for an indirect way he wants to be like the one of the most high so he takes the people away from the truth still further through his mystery he reveals to the people that since this great invisible father God does not concern himself in the Affairs of men but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshiped in silence and you know I I just thinking about this here through his Mysteries he reveals to the people I I just have to be honest with you as soon as I hear somebody talking about the message of the hour they want to preach about the message of the hour and they want to talk about the Mysteries and Mysteries and it's mysterious Mysteries mysterious I I pump the breaks this is revealed this message of the hour has been revealed to us it is not a mystery anymore that mystery is history and when I start hearing that continually it makes me wonder if it's not this doctrine that we're reading about right here remember Satan wants to get in so close that it would deceive the very elect so to think that he's not going to come into the message of the hour and try and corrupt the minds of the people it's a it's a mistake it's an error he's going to come right in he's going to try and confuse as many people and when it starts to get mysterious brothers and sisters that's when we need to step back and say Lord you you you've revealed it all you've put the sword of the word back into the hands of man place it into mine let let your spirit let your mind come into my life and reveal it to me let it not be a mystery anymore and I guarantee you if you do it genuinely he will reveal it it won't be a mystery but brother brother goes on to say here actually it means to ignore him as much as possible I got to read this again he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way so he takes the people away from the truth still further though through his Mysteries he reveals to the people that since the great invisible father God does not concern himself in the Affairs of men we pray and he doesn't answer we pray he doesn't answer the way we want it answered but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he will well be worshiped in silence I can come to a service and just say hey I'm here man I was here half an hour ago I I was here before even the deacons got I'm here I I drug my carcass to church can't you accept it what brother bradam says here actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not altogether this doctrine spread around the world also and right today in India you see that mult that the temples to the Great Creator the silent God are strikingly few in number since it was not necessary to worship the Creator father it was only natural that worship swung to the mother and child and we know that's Roman Catholic but it's not just Roman Catholic is what brother brandham brings out here it's crazy but it's true I think he calls it a paradox yeah mother and child as the objects of adoration in Egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called Isis and Osiris in India it was isay and osara osara not the similarity of names even note the similarity of names even I should get some glasses I really should in Asia it was seil and diois in Rome and in Greece it followed suit and in China well imagine the surprise of some Roman Catholic missionaries as they entered China CH and found there a Madonna with child and child with rays of light emanating from the head of the Babe the image could well have been exchanged for one in the Vatican except for the difference of certain facial features it now behooves us to discover the original mother and child the original goddess mother of Babylon was Samar who was called Ria in the Eastern countries in her arms she held a son who though a babe was described as a tall strong handsome and especially captivating to woman in Ezekiel 8:14 he was called tamuz amongst classical writers he was called bakus to the Babylonians he was nenus what accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms and yet described as a Great and Mighty Man is that he is known as the husband son one of his titles was husband of the mother and in India where the two are known as iswara and E he the husband is represented as the babe at the breast of his own wife that this nenus is Nimrod of the Bible we can affirm by comparing comparing history with the Genesis account pompus said nenus king of Assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by the desire for Conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors just got thinking about this can you imagine that no wars in the world yet no no real armies marching through the land and conquering and and pillaging everything in its way but here we have the first first one the first account he conquered all nations from Assyria to Liber Li to Li Libya as these men knew not the Arts of war and you know it's just making me think of this I'll call the musicians this is a real intricate part and I know it's really tough but it it's got some really good nuggets in here we'll call the music musicians as we close here it's it's just about 9:00 but I just wanted to reread one portion here brother Bram talks about how the one who is conquered the religion of the subduer became the religion of the subdued and so this one who was marching through the land conquering everyone was taking this religion this false religion and bringing it to everyone and there's no question in my mind that that was exactly what Satan wanted he wasn't necessarily interested in seeing them go and kill people people although he takes a lot of pride in that his goal was to spread this false gospel he was the first who carried war against his neighbors ninis from Nimrod he conquered all the nations from Assyria to Libya as these men knew not the Arts of War you know what I'm just going to stop there maybe stand with me as we we close tonight I know it's quite a technical portion of this study but um there's some really important parts in there I think it just goes right back to the very beginning you know we can say the trinitarian doctrine it it started at the at the Nan Council but that that trinitarian Doctrine as we've learned by reading it goes way farther back this is not something new this is a very old religion and uh and it's not a good one let's just go to in prayer as we close gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you for the the study that we've been able to partake of Lord Jesus over the the last many Wednesdays and Lord we thank you for this church age book we know that it's a summary of this message

book because it does point us directly to your word and we know this man that you used to to be the Vindicated Prophet for this age he he gave us the ability Lord Jesus to look at your word he said if

recognize Lord that you took that word and you opened it in in the in the hands of that man that Vindicated prophet and Lord he took that word that sword and he placed it in the heart of every single person that would dare look upon this message of the hour and tonight father Lord we pray that that word Lord that sword that's quicker and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword that it would Lord Jesus cut away all the tradition in our lives that it would cut away all the theology in our lives that it would cut away all the denominational teachings in our lives and father that it would just make room for your spirit in our lives father that your spirit could truly come and take up the Abode that you created father without hands Lord Jesus and we'll be careful to give you all the

hearts Lord oh Father by the faith that you have given us Lord Jesus your faith inside of us Lord let that worship come from your very throne in our hearts we love you we thank you we ask all these
