[Applause] straight from thee eyes when as live stream [Music] let's stream [Music] [Music] this trust remember yeah baby [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen I think that's all the thing it will do um let's just quickly go into the scripture so you can have your seats I'm reading fresh from Jeremiah first the first chapter of Jeremiah I'll just take the verse the verse 12. um thank you my friend I'll read it 11 and 12. I read 11 and 12. Jeremiah 1 all right Jeremiah 1 11 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what's he as thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree not 12. then say the Lord unto me thou has well seen for our history my word to perform it amen now the amplifier said a watch over my word to fulfill it amen um let's refresh Genesis chapter 1 I will read from 26. Genesis 1 26. and God said let us make money in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every crippling thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth may the Lord add His blessings unto the reading of his word he may be seated so I am very grateful for the privilege of standing before the most important lady on Earth right now it's a very special privilege um before I forget um let's all remember to pray for the ordeline sisters and the linear family as a whole um I think tomorrow well the the funeral starts tomorrow sort of like there's a sing song tomorrow and then the funeral is on on Friday yeah so let's remember it's never easy to lose their mother you are never ready for it for her to live so suddenly uh it'll take the Lord so let's be honest for them amen and so this evening I have some course that I just want to share and that is all I want to do I I think in the summer or even before the sermon you know when this we're thinking about marriage and and the things related to marriage um I I was just doing some studies and making some notes and and all I like I had it what I had in mind was for the young people who were like who were not yet married just a way to set sort of a realistic expectation you know as opposed to the fantasy of Hollywood and so uh those were the things that I had in mind those were the notes that I had and then uh when we had to when I had to go to Leverage [Music] um I couldn't just take it off I couldn't think of anything else I would try to read something I'll try to do anything about nothing so that that was what stuck to me and so then that is what I went to that bridge with it and just as I went there and I started I realized this is not going to be at one service center because I thought I'm doing it for somebody but I was learning probably more than everybody else and so on and on I think took about four services that I was there that was the only thing I did the purpose of marriage but one thing that kept popping up is this thought that I want to share with you uh tonight and it just kept coming up and I'll just mention it and keep going but afterwards I I felt like I had to actually give it some attention and then in recent times I started hearing the same thing running through everything that is going on here I hear brother Gilbert break it out of the wrong cycle and then he's talking about a jubilee year and the blowing of the trumpet and and how it spells freedom for everybody and yet you have to be it is specifically for the people of the Covenant who get the freedom and so you have to know who you are to get their freedom and I remember sitting there and thinking if I'm paying that debt for my lineage then maybe I can receive the blessing from my origin as well and so it it just it just kept going and then I think brother Bevin came with with preserving the seed uh for the purpose of God that was very direct like preserving the sea for the purpose of God so it's his own purpose and then relatively put it blindly God is responsible for you that's it I I so I feel like I've been inspired along these lines to say well let me just share this uh these thoughts with you and so this evening um my topic will be going back going back and and I like it because even when you say this so doesn't say much so you have to listen to me to know what I'm saying Hallelujah and so uh the scripture that we just read Genesis 1 26 God sets out to do something and in 26 he expresses the purpose for which he wants to do what he's going to do and so you see when he expresses the purpose it gets to 27 then it starts fulfilling and so he says yes he's going to create man but he says exactly what purpose for man to have dominion and so when it says that he sets out to to actually create man and afterwards in 28 he fulfills the other part of it which is actually passing on Dominion to man and so that is how it has been a recurring theme in in creation that God always expresses a purpose and once the purpose is expressed it must of necessity come to pass Hallelujah because he's the master of creation praise the name of the Lord and so you find out that in in Genesis chapter 1 verse 6 he expresses a purpose he says I want to make a firmament but what is that from moment for it is to separate the waters above from the waters below and so when you get to verse 7 you see that he created it and it did separate the waters above from the waters below when you get to uh verse 9 it says I want dry land and so he says oh let's see or let the waters gather into one place and lo and behold what has gathered into one place you have seen and you have dry land and so through our creation that was what it was now what I want to say is this there's nothing I can stop not stand in the face or that that can stand in the purpose of God from being fulfilled and so when you hear a purpose of God Express because that's actually the only way we will know the purpose of God is when he expresses it when you hear the purpose of God Express is the purpose of God fulfilled it may take a day it may take a minute it may take thousand years but it'll come to pass Allelujah now just as I'm saying this because that's not on my mind I'm thinking of God expressing a a desire so to speak expressing something about Ahab and saying ah who was going to convince Ahab so that he'll go to remote Gilead and go and fall that was God's expressed desire now even demon evil spirits fulfill God's purpose and so let's just start from that point now in Genesis we go to Genesis 14 it speaks about putting a light in the firmament but then when he says is putting the light in the firmament he actually says what it is for is it to give light on the earth into a separate day and night into this differentiate seasons praise the name of the Lord and so when it says that it gives all these purposes and then 17 18 it fulfills it and so that is it that is what I came to say that if God expresses a purpose that purpose will come to pass and so when we are reading Genesis 1 26 it is about us and Genesis 1 2 and says he says he created us to have dominion over the Earth Hallelujah now you realize that man was very unique in creation in the sense that we're the only ones who were created in the image of God were the only ones who were created in the likeness of God we are the only ones who were created to have authority over all of creation but the greatest privilege I say is that we're the only ones who have fellowship with God Hallelujah and fellowship with God was actually a purpose of God so the big elephant was created but there's no record of God having fellowship with elephants oh the the will is the biggest mama there's no record of God having fellowship with them with the will oh the The Majestic Lion and the wild tiger and all of this and the little ones and the beautiful breasts and the fishes there's no record of God having fellowship with them but Bank comes on the scene the one that was created to have dominion the one that was created in the image and likeness of God and suddenly God desires fellowship with man Hallelujah I'm reading my first code that is fellowship with God's reconciliation brother Abraham says God Longs for Fellowship he yes he wants people to speak with him and so once I say that I say let's see he says he loves Fellowship he wants people to speak with him it means that speaking with him is fellowship halleluia and how do we speak to God through prayer praise the name of the Living God so now when we start talking about love affair you have to understand that you have to want to talk to the person and the person has to want to talk to you Hallelujah he wants people to speak with him to talk with him you might think too much or you might pray too much sometime but there's one thing that you'll never be able to overdo that is pray the Bible said I will that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands you will never be able to have too much fellowship with God and God Longs for his creature who he created in His image to fellowship with him so it's not all of creation but the one that he created in His image to fellowship with him and so brother sister the next time you go on your knees remember it's not just about you and your list of wants it's not just about you and your list of needs God also desires Fellowship the question is are you going to give it how is the fellowship going to be done I remember one of these days we're talking with some friends and a a it just occurred with our servant the fact that of all the things that Jesus did the one thing that we asked him to teach us as his followers was prayer the Mind came on Earth he healed the sick we never asked him can you show us how to heal the sick he walked on water we didn't ask that if he didn't ask him how to sing we didn't ask him how to preach but we asked him how to pray now remember the people whose lips actually asked the Lord Jesus we are not any Ordinary People there were people who were prayerful already there were people who were who worshiped God and yet they asked him how to pray why they found a distinction the difference between how they pray and how the Lord Jesus prays and so there is something to learn because if there is flaw in our traditional way of doing it then there is a there is something to learn from how what Jesus taught us right and so prayer is important not just for us but for the Lord and as I'm saying that I'm fed yes it may not be as fun as you know singing singing this can be very fun even sometimes the preaching of the word people can enjoy it prayer isn't like that but if you understand the essence of it and that's what I was telling some people you if you understand that you either do it or die you will do it and you will take it serious and that is literally what it is we may not die physically but a prayerless Believer is a powerless believer and the prayers congregation is a powerless congregation and so let's understand it that when you go before Lord it is not expected to be a monologue and for me that is where my problem is a lot of times I'm busy I'll get on my knees I'll pray and I'll get up and go but that that is not Fellowship Hallelujah if we intend for it to be Fellowship then Fellowship must be in a way that will go before him that we actually know that we are going to go before him we schedule the time you see we don't have our schedule and fit God around whenever we have free time we schedule the time we look forward to it sometimes we even think of what we want to say and plan it so that you go knowing that this is going to be a good encounter and then once we go in the presence of the Lord let's let's take the time to express ourselves to him and after that let's relax and let him speak back to us that is when Fellowship is complete because if I invite you to my house and come and I give you a lecture do this do that don't do this do that done go that is not Fellowship and I I can assure you if you call me to your house and you do that to me I'll probably not come back anymore and so the idea is to fellowship with him to make him feel welcomed and to express ourselves to him Hallelujah and hear his voice Brian says when men and women used to pray all night and their homes were said in order by the book of the Lord and God was first in their homes see we got too many things ahead of of the Lord you can't have the prayer meeting because Mr Godfrey is on tonight you can't have prayer meeting because we love to see is on tonight or some kind of foolish nonsense like that that's right that takes up the time and we don't have time to hear the voice of God and those who do claim to be Christians just kneel down of a little prayer like this kind of homemade Lord bless me and my family and take care of us good night and the next morning rise and say just guide us through the day good day we should wait on the Lord you see we do all the Talking we don't give him a chance to talk back to us that if we would pray and pray unto our soul comes into the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice Hallelujah and so this is what God desired and this is what God did in the Garden of Eden but I just remember was the time when there was complete Harmony between God and man and that's what I came to say we are going back Hallelujah not before creating man God was the only one in His image he was the only one in his likeness he was the only one with authority over or every all of creation but once Man was created then there was another one in the image of God in the likeness of God but also has the authority of God so when God does that what is he doing he was creating God on Earth and that is our position praise the name of the Living God yes we're falling from it but we are going back Hallelujah so the very source of our position the very source of our privilege is the spoken word of God Hallelujah so understand it this way that before man was ever created God created the earth on which man will be God created the water that we will need God created the air that will breathe God created everything that we need but on top of all that he created a position and Authority Hallelujah so I understand that it is his purpose for us now we didn't create ourselves no and so we may have something and aim something we want to do but no we are here to serve a purpose there is nothing that God did that is without a purpose and so if God had a purpose that purpose must of necessity come to pass Allelujah and so for us to Manifest this this attribute to to manifest and and being the role and position that God has called it us to be we have to be in harmony with God because our position is dependent on his word our privilege our Authority is dependent on his word and so we have to be in harmony with him sure we came from him and that is the difference between man and all other creation we came from God hallelujah and so because for us to fulfill what we we have we started manifesting the attributes of God we started exercising authority of our creation we could speak to the wind we could speak to the sun we could speak to the trees that the lion and all these wild animals were tame before man we could exercise all of that why because that was God's purpose and as long as we're in harmony with him we were exercising that Authority and today I come to say we are going back now like I said we need that relationship of Harmony to fulfill God's purpose for us but at the same time God also needs that same relationship of Harmony to fulfill that purpose for us for his purpose to fulfill it as God needs that relationship of Harmony because God needs a divine order and his Spirit operates in his divine order and he never he doesn't go outside of that right and so if we are here today and we want salvation the divine order is faith education will not do it fasting 21 days will not do it we can jump up and down and make our best right here and just it will not do it the divine order is faith Hallelujah if you want healing it's like that now if we step outside of that let's say we talk of something like a sister wants to have a baby now there's no magic like snapping your finger and a baby baby will come out of you no it's nine months right that is divine order you want to know the word for your day you go to the prophet that is divine order and any time that divine order is in place God's spirit moves freely Hallelujah and so God needs that relationship for his purpose to be fully fulfilled in us now we have to remember that in creation or through creation God himself was also transformed and I understand that that is a bit of a difficult statement to make but that is what the message teaches us the true creation God was transformed first he was Elohim he was a self-existent one he was the god who lived alone but once he created us he became Jehovah Hallelujah The God Who lives with his family no in adoption 1965 Bible says he made a man an amateur God so he is in self-existence anymore he exists with his family now he's Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now God made man to be predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that is his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it will be so he could speak this and it will be so oh there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him there you are Hallelujah aren't you glad that the very identity of God is linked with us so if God cannot die we cannot die Hallelujah if God is omnipotent we are omnipotent praise the name of the Living God that is purpose of God for our lives Hallelujah and so you are an attribute of him he is still Jehovah tonight we are an expression of him praise the name of the Living God so even when he came to die he was looking for a part of him that makes him Jehovah Hallelujah now we found out in Genesis that when God looked at all that he had created the Bible says he was pleased and that like we just read he blessed it and he said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth what was God doing he was filling the Earth with his image and his likeness as present his attribute with all of this subjection to him after we came from him and we expressing of him so God wanted to fill the Earth with his likeness it has not happened but it's the purpose of God hallelujah and so it must of necessity come to pass that is why I'm here to say we are going back Hallelujah now the Bible says at the end of Genesis that God saw what he had made and it was good Hallelujah and so this is what God intended for us and so that is where we are going back to so we are going back to the time when God could visit man in the garden we are going back to the time when man had complete access to God when God will come in fellowship with man a man will fellowship with God praise the name of the Living God now in God's provided way of approach to Fellowship Abraham says fellowshipping around the world there is something great about it man loves to Fellowship even to the unconverted man he will want a business deal he will go out and talk to his friend buy a little dinner and they'll sit together and eat talk of a business problems and fellowship around one another because they have things in common as my old southern mother used to tell me birth of a feather flock together and that's a lot of Truth in that and I wonder about that then if we'll go back to the beginning all things begin in Genesis and in Genesis we found out that God created man for his Fellowship God loves to come down and to fellowship with his people Hallelujah but why because there was a divine order praise the name of the Living God so God loves the divine order in which we wear in the Garden of Eden where man was in the garden in the position that God created him everything else was in the position that God desired for it to be and we were fulfilling the purpose for which God created us hallelujah so that was perfect harmony and there was perfect Fellowship halleluia perfect harmony with God perfect Fellowship because that was his purpose for us and since his purpose cannot be defeated we are going back praise the name of the Living God now in the message Fellowship Abraham says now when God made man in the beginning to fellowship with him then this man was in perfect Fellowship in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been on that day when God will come down the cool of the evening and call Adam he and Eve would come up and they would worship God and they'll fellowship and commune one with the other that's the very thing that calls us together like this sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit no difference in us we are all one in Christ Jesus in that Perfect Harmony of Fellowship there is nothing like it I've ever found on Earth is to come together in Heavenly places and have communion fellowship with God and with each other that's what God intended in the garden halleluia now in this order there was no room for the devil and so now the devil threw the serpent attacked the woman or should we say he attacked Humanity or maybe even better say he had attacked God's divine order Hallelujah and how did he do it because there's a divine order if he just gets one out of place that is all it takes that is so and that is what he did WOW by interpreting the word to the woman or you can say interpreting or misinterpreting because he's not called to interpret the word so once he takes that role he's misinterpreted already Hallelujah now remember that was the attack then that is the attack still today and so remember if the devil wants to come after us he will attack God's divine order he wants to go after the children why does he do he goes after marriages praise the name of the Living God and so let's just understand these things that there are certain basic things that are in the Bible they are there to fulfill God's purpose like I said there's nothing that God instituted just for the sake of doing no there's always a purpose and that purpose unfortunately has been switched in these days but then he created a people and restored a word that together will go back to restore the divine order so that his purpose will be fulfilled again we are that people so over and over Abraham speaks about divine order but ah I don't I can't read all the quotes here still with me I have a few to read if you remember the story of brother Abraham in Finland and when this little boy the two boys were strapped with the car and one died and the other didn't die and brother Brown got there saw the Dead one prayed for the dead one the Dead one came back to life and then the other one who was in the hospital was dying and the parents minded their way to brother Abraham and they came with the direct request the mom said come and heal our boy well I don't heal I cannot heal so then Brown has to explain divine order is God who heals he said well you hear the other one he said no God did that and God actually showed me by a vision he says okay then see a vision you can never underestimate the love of a mother see have you seen for for our boy he says no I can't so again you have to explain divine order and then as he goes on he says now are you believers they said no he said so you're asking a lot when you are yourself not the believer so in simple times he explained to them that well the boy is very little if he dies it's going to heaven but if you die as unbeliever you'll never see the boy now if you die as Believers even if the boy dies you'll see him again and so but but all what I want to bring across is that there's a divine order so when you explain that okay even after you accept him then you can claim his promise then they thought they cannot lose by accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and they did and the Lord was faithful praise the name of the Living God and so all what I want to say is this don't allow the devil to break any divine order in your life don't get out of position don't get out of place even if it cost you your job stay in your position in God's program because that is how the spirit of God moves and God has a purpose for pleasing you where he has placed you Hallelujah now um there's another place where Abraham speaks about Moab and Israel and he says they are both religious but the mobiles look down upon the Israelites and he said yes because they don't have the denomination that we have they don't have a king they don't have a land of Their Own they are just tent dwellers they are Renegades moving around and then Barbara says they fail to see the smitten Rock they failed to see their brass serpent they failed to see a prophet that they had received a message and they were going to their promise under a divine order and that is what makes the difference now I believe there are people here tonight who have received the prophet who have received a message who have received a visitation of the pillar of fire Hallelujah and that was my purpose and the purpose is that we are going back praise the name of the Living God Hallelujah so even in Satan saying God still requires divine order right now from the Garden of Eden we know that the pure word of God produce the son of God who was in perfect harmony with God now we also know that the devil cannot create and that's because the devil has no word listen the most perverted of word is God's word pervaded the devil cannot claim it as his own he just progresses and uses for his purpose but you see the perverted word also produced a hybrid man seed of the serpent who in it was in every way a man and yet a murderer right he had the characteristics of his father now we should also have the characteristics of our father and so from that time civilization has evolved on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and so we missed an entire civilization of God we don't even remember how it was we know almost nothing about it unless what we read about from the Bible about all along the evolution has been on the knowledge of true and Evil and that is because that is the choice that we made but now that knowledge the Tree of Life sorry was God's purpose for us and so now we have to go back to it and that's what God is restoring to a particular people praise the name of the Lord now I'm going to read something about the power of transformation Rebrand says now he has six thousand years to do it with his poison spirit and he was talking about the devil and how did he do it now this is the Striking part and listen close down he did it by civilization now that sounds strange but that's what I'm going to make a statement here that will keep you guessing maybe for a few minutes I hope not but did you realize this no I'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that Civilization Science Education and the things that we cherish so great today is they're very instrument of Satan even civilization civilization never come by God civilization come by Satan now I'll prove that to you by the word just in a few minutes civilization is not of God for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we are always killing ourselves this civilization has built up to its Pinnacle now and we got death in this civilization we got sin in this civilization we've got sickness in this civilization that can't be of God so God his own great Kingdom that is to come we will have a civilization but it will not be anything like this it won't be by science it will be a faith Civilization by the word see there's this scientific civilization we have is exactly Satan's trap Hallelujah so we completely Miss That civilization and yes I'm grateful for what we have today but it's nothing compared to what God intended for us and because it was his purpose we must of necessity go back now if it is going to be a world-based civilization then what happens when we receive the full word what happens when it is restored to us right so faith in the word of God actually is initiation into God's civilization that is to come and remember it's an eternal civilization praise the name of the Living God now let me read this God's power to transform Abraham says and there will not be this kind of civil as a civilization in the world to come there will be no automobiles or nothing that science has ever done there will be no such things in the world that is to come but it will be God's Own type of civilization that he will set up in the Glorious Reign for in this civilization there is sickness dead sorrow griffs and wants but in that Kingdom that is to come there is no death no sorrow no sickness no old age oh God it'll all be new there in your civilization Hallelujah and so you see today we've we've made a lot of advancements we all know that I can finish from here and be in Edmonton in two or three hours and even that I'll go in in warmth I won't be suffering all the call that that we have now that is scientific advancement we can talk about the speed of cars and the speed of planes I can leave here and maybe be in Africa in 18 hours maybe even 16 hours right and so that is simple that is that is advancement and we ought to be grateful for that today uh we can see a baby in the womb we can't diagnose the baby in the womb we can even start treating the baby in the womb before they are born and that is good but what if there is no sickness and that's the other civilization what if we could travel at the speed of thought then of what uses the supersonic or whatever name we give it and so what is going on is that we don't have a feel of how that is but it makes a complete nonsense of all that we think is great right now and that is what we're going back to he didn't do that just for Rachel just waste away no he did it and we were at the helm of that and we are going back to it Hallelujah so we have no memory of what we missed but we have a fortress of it praise the name of the Living God now interest reference is all this modern civilization the whole educational program the whole scientific program is all contrary to God's word and his will civilization is absolutely there will never be a civilization in the world that is to come like this one this is a perverted civilization God had his first civilization upon the earth when he spoke his words and they come up every seed of his clan and in that Civilization there was no death sickness or sorrow Hallelujah praise the name of the Living God so parallel systems came up the pure World produced a man in harmony with God and produced a civilization and then the perverted word produced a man who opposed everything divine and It produced a perverted civilization unfortunately our choice was a preventative civilization but God's purpose cannot be defeated amen so in spite of that attack on God's divine order in the garden which is what created this perverted civilization that Abraham calls it God has always sought to reconcile his children he has always sought to bring back his children to himself why it says because it is his purpose or it was his purpose from the beginning and so when you recognize who you are when you recognize where you are from when a word comes to tell you where you are from what is it doing you have found your way back and that is why I come to say we are going back now like I said uh when the Jubilee trumpet sounds is for the people of the covenants right if you're not of the Covenant it may be a great trumpet or it may be nice but if you have the Covenant when you hear it you react when you hear it you claim your freedom and that is what all of this has been to emphasize Who We Are to emphasize who we've been and to tell us that we can go free we can go back now I'm reading for Satan's Eden and time is far gone already I will try to read portions quickly the God has attributes in his body now you did not know anything when you were in your father but yet science and God's word proved that you were in your father but you know nothing about it now that's the way now now that's the way God was in the beginning every son and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him praise the name of the Lord he says then when we went to take when he went to take a little rest his enemies lived in if animus lived in in this discipline with disease and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children see he slipped in the enemy of God slipped in and misinterpreted the word Hallelujah so I'll just cut some of them now so the fall in the garden broke the harmony between God and man but you feel if you were in him then it becomes his responsibility to restore you thank you brother Toby for that ceremony and he does that by restoring the word for our day you see when God sets out to restore the word he was setting out to restore man back to his original position Hallelujah so the word gave man his position right the word restores man in God's divine order in the beginning and so we lost it by this believing and God is working to restore it now Hallelujah and so when I say we are going back it is on the authority of the word that there is something that we bypass and it has been God's desire to restore and because it's his purpose because it's his plan and because I've seen that he's restored to you and I so then I have the authority to say yes we are going back Hallelujah and so that is why what it has been restored to us we have to take it and we have to eat it thank you brother Gilbert we have to take it and we have to eat it because there are real lives of victory therein lies are restoration therein lies our way back there is no other way the one who placed it in that position is working to bring us back and he says this is the way he's doing it Hallelujah in the church at the last young Church age programs says the word always came by a prophet and always will that this is the law of God is evident even by a casual search of scripture now if you have Revelation you see it clearly otherwise you can't even see that you will Challenge and say yeah it comes to my pastor oh it comes to this great bishop and it comes to that evangelist no it comes to the prophet Hallelujah he says the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where the people are strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word of God God sends his servant to these people in order to correct false teachings and lead the people back to God you see what the message is doing you understand why it was sent to you praise the name of the Lord now you may be asking because when we say certain things what the devil does is tell you well it's in the Bible we are seeing the message so it's true God is restoring his word and with that he's restoring the people back to their position but it's not for you right that's what he comes to tell you so how do you know that it's for you yes we may not remember that we were in him but we have the evidence Hallelujah and what is the evidence he's brought the word to us we've received it we've believed it and we are living it that is why I can say we are going back because that is the confirmation Now understand that in this end time for us it came by Elijah's Ministry and and that is right now what I'm doing with the children but that is a little different because it's slowly a little bit of time and and you cannot go very deep but slowly it's necessary they have to know why we are different they have to know why we will Skip and drive distance to come here when there are churches bigger churches close by our houses they have to understand it that God has a specific purpose and you were chosen for that Hallelujah and how do I know that and and so this is what I like if parents could just talk to the children now what did you learn about Sunday School you know just just talk to them tell them something uh question them teach them a little bit make them know that they can also ask you questions because it's it's important not just to be good Christians quite frankly that's not what I do down there no not good Christians no to know why we are different and what is God's purpose for us and that's for us alone listen and I this is there it's not enough time for me to go through every Elijah Ministry but I can at least I can mention the original Elijah Ministry when it burst on the scene it was complete condemnation and rebuke to their denominations they couldn't accept it when that Ministry broke out straight away when when a break there will not be rain on the earth until I call for it then he's gone what was it judgment the last time he comes on the scene Mount Carmel show down call the people let's go and he slaughtered us all them prove that God is the only living God judgment the next time I have missed him in the garden of neighbors oh have you killed and you are coming to inherit what was it judge when you pronounced judgment on him and on his entire family and on Jezebel even when they say go and bring that man can you imagine you're going to bring one old man you need a military Captain with 50 I'm sorry I'm a little Captain with 50 military men to go and bring one man so they themselves they had their fear before they will approach them but even that if I be man of God let Fire come and consume that and they are gone 50 they are gone so over and over again Elijah's Ministry was a rebuked to their denominations that is why they can never accept it they can never like it they can never bring it to the mainstream and I always say it go to any Bookshop if there's any left go there Christian Bookshop and ask for a book of William Brown see if you'll find it no why and God permits it because it was for a very special lady Now understand that when all of this happened he was actually sent to a gentile lady is that right he was sent to zaraphat or if you read the New Testament sister raptor is the same he wasn't desire about which is Insider so that is at the past the northern borders of of Israel so this is this was in Lebanon then it's still in Lebanon today it was never part of Israel so the ministry was sent to a particular Gentile woman did the woman receive it Hallelujah aren't you glad that it was sent to you it was specific listen even when God was calling Elijah he says I've commanded a widow woman to take care of you so it's not just anything that Widow man was commanded you are under command from God to receive that message praise the name of the Living God and it is coming to sell the purpose for which it was sent so don't receive it and still doubt is it for me it wouldn't come to you and when I say it wouldn't come to you I mean you won't believe it enough to say that I believe the message yeah because many people hear it and they turn their back it didn't come to them right like when when Elijah's Ministry was targeting a particular General you saw how it went somebody got captured went to the house spoke the wife heard it another person heard it they all didn't think it was for them and then the general name and had it he said no this is for me this is my call you understand it so when you respond this and and you go to this cold weather and come and sit here don't question whether it's for you because you see when you embrace it when you accept it the first benefit for that woman what was it the food was guaranteed throughout the family rather we have food since that we have food we have enough food today praise the name of the Living God and because she stayed there and at that because that was all that was available and she added what was the second benefit she received the resurrection I'll just leave it at that because there's too much in there but I just say this to and let you understand that God has thought of you he had a purpose for you from the foundation of the earth yes our Humanity God in the way but it does not defeat God's purpose and he is bringing us back to that purpose that is why we're sitting here so please we have the food let's eat it Hallelujah I'm reading from the audition Church age programs is already the visible manifestations of what I've been telling you are seen all around us their communicable move of the test is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet for the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will for around the second coming of the Lord for by his message with the hearts of the children returned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of the power if you're looking for that power where do you find it eat the word eat the book I said so the revealed word on one hand is for the bride it feels the bright it empowers the bride the perverted word it distracts the bride from God and there's so many of that around go to the internet go anywhere at all now social media everybody is preaching their specialty for Africans is often prophecy soccer and politics oh this one is going to win elections here and this one is going to score this margin like like it's so perverted it's it's just ugly but God has his pure word still and this is For Those whom he has he intends to restore back to the original and so let's remember that just like everything else that God does there is a purpose Hallelujah when he sends the message there is a purpose it is not a hidden purpose no it is to send us back to the beginning Hallelujah his purpose for us before creation which is a declared in his word which we bypass by unbelief his restoredness back to us back to that Hallelujah now what makes it difficult for many people is the fact that the message was not sent to everyone and without notion of of justice and everything and give it to everybody no God came for his own what came out of him is what he's looking to restore praise the name of the Living God I don't want to sound like a Gilbert and all the Israel but yes when it flashes your identity before you he's saying you belong here that is not you Hallelujah Hallelujah so this is what brings us back to the beginning now I'm reading this and I'll be closing in a just one or two chords I'm reading why and how to be Shepherds 1964. Brian says it wasn't his clergy man it was in the theologians that's right it wasn't the denominational people no it was Shepherds why there was a sheep born that's the reason see his subject heard it God knew exactly who God knew would believe it God sent his message to those who would believe it praise the name of the Living God so if you are here you've received it you've believed it in your own feeble way you're making the effort to live it don't despair it was sent to you for a purpose and God will not relent until he see his purpose fulfilled until he see you manifested in the way he wants you right he's all wisdom he knows where to send his message who will believe it Hallelujah now uh he says now this is what here is out Elijah says having got a great big bunch of cooperation now he's talking about his ministry now this is good and somebody to go around and make so many hundred churches corporate and big bring great singers and so forth then Barbara Brown says I don't desire that imagine God has sent you to pray to the world send healing to the world he doesn't desire people going to get hundreds of churches to cooperate and all that no I don't desire that that ain't mine I believe the ministry is to the elect to those who want to listen Hallelujah do you want to listen because God sent it for his own Hallelujah and if we send it to you then it has to fulfill the purpose for which he sent it praise the name of the Living God we have a place to go to we have our own civilization waiting for us hallelujah so we've been reminded that we were created to have dominion the devil got us to doubts we lost our position our god-giving position but let's understand it this way that position we didn't earn it in the first place it's not as if there was a competition and we struggled and we did our best time we got there no it we got we were there because it was God's purpose and what I'm saying is that the purpose of God can never be defeated so if we lose it forever God is not God and for him to be God he has to restore us that is why he is responsible for us and that's why he sought and made a way to restore that word to us because that word restores the divine order and in that divine order God oppressed completely and that is why I saw the power to rust so we start even living that life experiencing that that that that position and pray of privilege here on Earth before we go to him so whatever happens brother sister all I came to say is we are going back so we know that God the word has been restored and when the restoration comes the Power but Abraham says we don't realize how important it is to stay true to this word now when he says this word he actually tells you that is that message that the seventh angel is bringing right so how important it is for us to stay true to this word but now we have it it's on our phones we have easier assets than fast food I believe God made sure of that so what are we doing with it Hallelujah I'll call the musicians the spoken word is the original silver branches you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning hallelujah thank you brother Gilbert but being that you come the way you did you are subject to the fall but being that you are predestinated you hear the word you understand why you heard the word you are predestinated God sends a prophet to come and tell you that I came to tell you this because you are predestinated should we doubt it let's not break the divine order amen so being that you come this way you are subject to the fall but being that you are predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen Hallelujah okay I think that the time is far spent I'll leave some of these codes but all I want to say is we have it it has a purpose there's a reason why he brought it to us and it has to achieve a purpose are we going to allow ourselves or are we going to resist it it's far easier to allow ourselves than to resist it when you are God's choice think of Jonah think of The Prodigal Son when you are God's choice you are better off relaxing Letting Go surrender to this word and let it have its affected you that was God's purpose let it be fulfilled praise the name of the Living God you are way better of doing that resistance let's read on it but more than that let's focus on feeding on it exclusively but that word has a purpose it's different it's different from any other one that comes it is for you I'm not saying somebody else is not going to ever know but for you and I this is what brings us in the rapture this is what send us back to where we're coming from Hallelujah let's be on our feet [Music] God prepare me amen [Music] Lord pray baby [Music] Friday truth foreign with the skin [Music]
