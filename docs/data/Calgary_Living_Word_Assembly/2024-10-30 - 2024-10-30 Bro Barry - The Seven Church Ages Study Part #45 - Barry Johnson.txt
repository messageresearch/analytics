this opportunity One More Time Lord father where we can gather together in your name and we know your word says that where two or three are gathered in your name that you're there already and father we're so thankful that we can not only just recognize you father and welcome you but Lord we can pour our love on you father Lord we don't want to just call upon your name we don't want to just claim your blood but father we want to recognize you we want to greet you with a kiss Lord father we want to wash your feet Lord Jesus and Lord we want to anoint you with oil father thank you Lord and Lord Jesus to wash your feet with our tears Lord Hallelujah father the way that you have created us father thank you Lord in this sinful nature Lord this hybrid condition this pest house you have given some people a desire Lord to worship you father and worship you not just according to a a theological study but father in spirit and in truth according to the word we've been given in the age which we live and father that's the grounds that we come to you tonight father through the Revelation that you've given to us in this age father we pray that if there's anything in our lives Lord that displeases you that you would forgive us for it just now Lord that we could commit it unto you that we would not think that we know it all or that we've done it all or that we have it all father Lord we need you tonight and we just want to ask Lord that we could present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice Lord Jesus we know the high priest could not go behind that inner Veil without having everything right and father we recognize whose presence we're in tonight the king of kings and Lord of lords oh Father not some second or third person of a trinity oh Lord the King of Kings the creator of the universe our husband father help us Lord Jesus to tend to your needs tonight father Lord as we pour our love out on you huah Lord help us to be conscious of you and what your desires are what your needs are father Lord so many times we just have a laundry list of our needs Lord but father we love you and we desire to please you amen help us Lord Jesus to give you that which you desire amen and father we know that when you were in the garden you had one request father when you prayed for the the people on Earth for your brethren and that one request Quest was for Fellowship Lord father we pray that we could give you that Fellowship that you desire we know there's only one way that can happen and that's to come according to your word father so Lord Jesus let us strip ourselves of any Humanity tonight Lord and just step beside ourselves father and enter in behind that inner Veil Lord Jesus and allow you to wash us one more time father by the washing of the water of the word we don't want to leave this building the same we don't want to leave this meeting the same father we pray that you would be with those who are traveling tonight father wherever they are those who are streaming tonight father bless them abundantly father we pray Lord Jesus father that you would continue raising up Sister jarmain Lord father and we just want to uphold those two unspoken requests before your throne Lord Jesus you know them and father we thank you for the needs in our lives and we know that you're more than un aable to meet our needs now father as we go forwards Lord the highest order of the service is to allow you to speak help us all to get out of the way father the speaker and the hearer alike let us come together in the unity of your spirit Lord and allow you to move in our hearts Lord father we love you and we thank you we just commit each life Lord each and every need father into your hands as we go forwards we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight just like to continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages reading from Revelations chapter 3 verse 1 Revelations CH 3 verse 1 and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if thou therefor if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled thy garments their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you that you have given us this opportunity Lord Jesus to amen be here tonight but not just to be here tonight father but to be in this age Lord knowing the position the stations that we're all in Father we are here not so that we can be defeated Lord we are here so that we can overcome and father we just ask that tonight One More Time Lord you would come on the scene and help us Lord to recognize that you have done it all for us we love you father and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a couple of announcements as we get going here uh we have a gym rented for tomorrow evening for those people who are available we know the whole entire world in North America anyways likes to Revel in the theory of Halloween and death and hell and the grave is just abundant you don't have to go looking for it in fact you have to hide your eyes from it in the world in which we live in it's terrible but that's the world we live in so we have decided to try and do something for uh families and for children if you are available I sent it out on the WhatsApp the information and if you have any questions by all means um just let me know and we would love to just get together and have a little Fellowship tomorrow night we got a prayer meeting coming up next Thursday 7:30 p.m. and uh I believe the youth meeting will be on the 17th of November as well and uh yeah are you happy tonight it's wonderful to know that we are in his presence the king of kings and Lord of lords you know I just got thinking about it and uh it's been a while since I read this so I just thought I would go back to to this and uh I know that there's people that watch this online and maybe some that are streaming people don't understand many times what it is we're reading this book was uh penned by William Mariam Branham and uh basically it's what we believe as what we would call the message of the hour in essence in this in this book and we know that he had uh Theologian grammar tize it is the way that he worded it and that would uh we would probably say he edited the book but you know this isn't a man looking to draw a man unto himself he is simply pointing people to Christ and the very last page in this book is what I want to read starting with uh in the book I have here anyways it's paragraph 73 and and for anybody that's interested I'll just show you um this is the book that I'm using if you don't have one and you would like one I can certainly provide you with one um it's from Brother George Smith he produced this book and uh we ordered them directly from him but at the end of it um it's the uh third last paragraph of the exposition of the seven Church ages and I believe it's the resume of the ages brother Bram he says so we conclude the seven Church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church es now this is brother bradam just I believe speaking his heart here he says I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the age but he has been Faithfully dealing with hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all the preaching and teaching for it is the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and and follow him not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization now I'm just going to highlight that part right there or start some fellowship and organization that Dov tales with what we're going to talk about tonight in the sardan church age this is Brother brandham giving instruction here not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart I just think it's such a wonderful wonderful description of the message and and you know sort of who William branam we'll say is because we know he's not dead but who he was when he was here on Earth he wasn't looking to start an organization he wasn't looking to create an organization and and a fellowship and have a bunch of people join the brandham Tabernacle and many times he even rebuked the brandham Tabernacle just like he did the denominational churches and said everybody needs to get right with God we need to be looking at Christ Christ Jesus is the one that died for our sins not William Mary and bradam and not for one second do we claim that William Mary and bradam has anything to do with our Salvation other than an introduction to the Lord Jesus Christ amen just like elaser was sent to find the bride for Isaac we left off last week with uh where was it here oh my the last subheading was the salutation and tonight we're going to pick up with a denunciation that's out of Revelations 3 verses 1 and two says I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead for I have not found thy works perfect before God I just think that's speaks volumes right there we know brother Bram says it that every single Church age bleeds into the other and all of this applies to every single Church age it's not exclusive to the sardan church age even though it's brought out from the sardan church age and highlighted from the sardan church age it applies to every single age these words I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead for I have not found thy works perfect before God there's only one thing that's perfect before God who knows what that is his Spirit only one thing we have his Spirit we have that Perfection that he's looking for outside of that our our our righteousness is but filthy rags now he says now here indeed is a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praised the True Believers and then denounced the false Vine but in this period there is evidently such wanton disregard for the Lord and his word that the entire message to this fifth age rings with condemnation my I Know Thy Works what were these works that came up before the Lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each age lapped over into the next age so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age age into the fifth these works as you are well aware were number one the leadership of the Holy Spirit was superseded by a human hierarchy number two the pure word of God and its free benefit to all men was deposed for Creeds dogmas Church orders ETC number three the word Worship in the spirit and gifts of the Spirit and all that which pertains to True Community Fellowship of the Saints was cast aside for Liturgy and literal idol worship Pagan feasts ETC number four Mary ol tree was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship until she had actually assumed a place of godhead and the son was brought from his lofty position of overall to being subservient to a man called the pope who termed himself the Vicor of Christ it's so interesting when you look at the the pictures of of uh marol Tre for a while I uh you know how you can follow things online for a while while I saw something Catholic pop up and so I thought you know I'll follow that I'll just see what what that is what what pops up and and the pictures continually are of the mother and a little tiny babe a little babe that looks like a man a face like a man and then pictures like the pope and just this continual thing feeding I just thought my goodness marry ol tree yeah putting the woman up above the child and making yeah it's wild but it's real it's very current brothers and sisters if you don't have to look far but I stumbled into it and and I I just I guess I couldn't really believe that it was that far but it very much is goodness carrying on here so I guess I should just say these four things I think are are very important and uh probably well worth looking at because these are works that that Jesus Jesus said that God said I know your works but they're not anything in my sight they will not actually bring the results that you think they're actually Leading Men away from him carrying on he says those who fought this terrible Antichrist Church were destroyed those who stayed with it found themselves the pawn of the church whether they be peasants or Kings their lives were not their own and neither were their lives christs what a place to be hey but they belonged Body Soul and Spirit to the Church of Rome they talked about the blood of Christ yet they purchased their salvation with money and bought forgiveness of sins either by gold or Penance now this next part is wild the wealthier of them found it a happy situation when Pope Leo X allowed them to buy indulgences for Sins Not Yet committed so that they with ease of conscience could plan their awful crimes and then proceed to carry them out knowing that the pope had already remitted their sins the word of God was kept from them so who was to know the truth no wonder it was the Dark Ages since truth comes only from the word the people were shut up in a dungeon of the Roman Church awaiting death and after death judgment but the great drunk with the blood of Martyrs and with no thought of the Judgment reeled savagely on to kill men with both spiritual and physical death now toward the end of the fourth age which would be the beginning of the fifth age also the invasion of Constantinople by the Turks sent the learn Scholars of the East with their Greek manuscripts to the West the purity of the word and the teachings of True Believers were thus disseminated and not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the basis of our modern printing presses was discovered facilitating the production of books thus we find the great hunger and demand for the Bible could be answered tremendous God will not allow his children to be without light to be without representation and I just think this this whole last part of the paragraph just made me think about the magnetic recording device that was released upon the Earth that technology that was released many people think it's for Hollywood and movies and rock and roll and all the stuff that goes on computers it was simply so that the voice of God through a Vindicated Prophet could be recorded so there would be a witness against this generation and if you wonder what I'm talking about specifically for anybody that might maybe be hearing this for the first time I know everyone here is a veteran to the message present tonight but if you just listen 1964 in the message of the hour I just picked 1964 because that's where I'm at right now but just about every single one of those messages in 1964 there is a space at the end of the message where you hear God speak through this man he tells people things and he begins to tell people things in Rapid succession not just like brother sitting there wearing the blue shirt you have something wrong in your life and and something else and then wait and then another brother over here on the other side no the brother in the blue shirt you've got this and the sister sitting beside you you've got that and the brother sitting beside her you've got that and the brother sitting beside them and the sister and the brother and the sister and the brother and he goes on and on and on how can you say things like that even if you had a microphone in an ear and somebody with a microphone telling you these things it would be very difficult to speak as rapid and accurate as he did that's just one message there's thousands of messages where at the end you can hear the prayer line and you can hear the discernment that that discernment is only of God Amen that's why the magnetic recording device was created but it just made me think about it here the beginning of it you know and even in our day we can see that they stop printing books now the voice of God Recordings for better for worse I'm not judging them I'm just saying that the progression from from printing books like crazy to not printing books anymore and going now digital with all of it it's interesting it's interesting the next paragraph he says God raised up many Mighty Men of which Luther was but one Calvin and zwingley were two other luminaries and besides these were many many more who were not so well known however all of this was not in vain the mighty work of God was actually hindered by these very men wow for one thing they did not oppose the church State marriage of the Nan Council but actually fostered that Union the defense of the Gospel by the state was welcomed though there was no word for it and you know it was in their day we can look at it and say that's awful that they did that but it meant death there was no middle ground you either were on board or you were in the grave right and we know that God God will always have a witness it's beautiful I think brother Ram talks about it in here too you know maybe even comparing it I don't know I get confused sometimes I get ahead of myself but you know how brother bradam talks about the prophet Jonah many times people will say that Jonah was a backslider and Jonah was out of the will of God but we know the prophet of God said he was very much in the will of God he was doing exactly what he needed to do exactly the way God intended it he was playing out the role that was created for him but naturally speaking like these brothers it didn't really look that good but who are we to judge he goes on to say many many more who are not so well known however through all this was not in vain the mighty work of God was actually hindered by these very men for one thing they did not oppose the church State marriage of the nyine council but actually fostered that Union the defense of the Gospel by the state was welcome though there was no word for it and though we can see the wrath of man praising God in such events as Henry VII taking up for the reformation and the rejection of papal Authority it was a far cry from the truth of Pentecost and protection of an omnipotent God in spite of Luther's constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop Archbishop concept of church government and we know that's very very alive and well today that whole thing men's minds are not clear and and some like that idea of Bishop and Archbishop uh Theory and uh we know that that's it's it's not right you he goes on to say thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained Shackled so in short order she was again imprisoned in the same dungeon when she had attempted to escape still the cup of the Abominable Works was not yet full not only did Luther through poor judgment in sight to battle and thereby caused the death of multitudes but zwing ley's party persecuted to prison The Godly Dr Hub me and through it and though it did not commit him to the stake it was actually responsible in great measure for his eventual death by fire and Calvin did no less for he demanded the arrest of servitus who had seen and taught the Oneness of the godhead the state then tried this brother and to Calvin's dismay he was burned at the stake if there was ever a time of denominational Zeal it was at this tragic time the words of Communists describe much of this era commenius wrote the one thing needful he compares the world to aabr and shows that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ that's such a beautiful statement you know alls we ever need to do is get to the place where we've become desperate in our lives and everything in our lives that's needless we'll just say it doesn't matter we'll choose the one thing needful the great number of teachers he says is the reason of the multitudes of sex for which we shall soon have no names left each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred I say Lord let that not purvey or come through in our churches here no reconciliation is to be hoped for between them they meet Amity with irreconcilable Amity out of the Bible they Forge their different Creeds these are their fortresses and bulwarks behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks I will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves they become so how however in that they feed the fire of emnity only by putting them away to all together would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church that's a mouthful that paragraph but I believe that's something that should be read it should be pondered on because Spirits don't die and I for one have seen this even in modern times where we live a church says this about another church and they do something and they don't do another thing and we can find ourselves saying hey you know what we're pretty pure here we actually we've got the truth and and on and on and on we need to say no no no no no the only thing we have is Jesus Christ we have the word of God we have his Spirit living out through us and he will lead us and guide us but as soon as we start to see emnity rising up we know that that's not right he goes on to say to this Labyrinth of sects and various confessions another belongs the love of disputation what is attained by it it has a single learned has has a single learned Strife ever been settled never their number has only been increased Satan is the greatest sophist he has never been being overcome in a Strife of words and we know that brother Ram said you will never win a dispute with the Theologian you will never win a dispute with a theologian and I think it's real important for us to remember in the day in which we live in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by learned disquisitions and disproving the views of others and we've seen it even in the message maybe some people will get upset with me for even talking this way but let's just be honest we can see it in the message and we can have a quote battle well I believe we should do it this way well I believe we should do it that way well I've got a quote and I've got a quote everybody's got a quote what do the quotes do for us let's get Jesus Christ and let him lead and guide us he's the one that will lead lead us into all truth of the new birth and how a man must be changed into likeness of Christ to become partaker of the divine nature 2 Peter 1:4 scarcely anything is said let's turn over there second Peter verse one let's just take a look at that second Peter 1 verse4 second Peter 1 verse4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by the ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust sometimes I think it's good just to pick up on what he's talking about here the divine nature scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loose Remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and of our life in Christ have been made the occasion of bitterest conflict a cause of mutual hatred a center of SEC SEC sarian ISM in short chry andom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept now I'm just going to read that again the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith let's turn over to Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4 verse 13 and we know that this is maybe we'll just pick up the background we'll start with verse 11 pretty famous scripture here we're all familiar with and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what for the perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and this is the verse out of the book we're reading tonight till we all come in the unity of the faith not some of us and not most of us until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Ephesians 4:13 brother Bram says until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith as the Heavenly Master Built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all with the Bible in our hand we should cry I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obediently keep his Commandments I hope for that which he has promised Christians give ear there is only one life but death I have this highlighted here there is only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there is only one Christ but a thousand antichrists brothers and sisters I think that would be a fridge magnet statement something to put on a mirror in our bathroom every day just to read that and think about it and and meditate on it in our lives there is only one Christ but a thousand Antichrist carrying on he says so thou knowest oh Christan what is the one thing needful either thou turnest back to Christ or thou goest to destruction like the Antichrist if Thou Art wise and wil live follow the leader of life but you Christians rejoice in your being caught up hear the words of your heavenly leaders say come unto me answer with one voice even so we come and I believe that's why we worship when we get in church and we have the opportunity to close our eyes and and lift our hands and raise our voice we're just answering with one voice even so we come my now I just said that this era gave tremendous growth to the denominational Spirit if the Corinthian attitude of I am of Paul and I of cleopas was ever exhibited it was now there were lutherans hites zwingley party Etc such fragmentation of the body was deplorable and they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matrimony to the state and that means they married the state they did it they were finished we're not supposed to marry theate State we're not supposed to marry the church we're supposed to marry Christ here were those lutherans who had criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteous of unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by the Judas judaizers went right ahead and made the state instead of God the defender of the faith this is the first denomination of repute that came out of the Harlot but when Luther died it was not long until it had a hierarchy like the one it had fought I just want to read this again when Luther died it was not long until they had a hierarchy like the one it had fought this move of God by the time the second second generation came along was right back under the wing of her mother she had gone back and did not even know it they had taken on their own name above his name they were living their own name too and all the denominations that are doing that very thing today they are living their own name and not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but none are known by the power of God I say Lord help us we don't look for signs and wonders but we know they follow and when we don't have signs and wonders following where are we at he says there is your test and I want you to notice right here that this era did not have signs and wonders amongst them just for the record I'm not saying I wish we had signs and wonders I know that if we pass the microphone around everyone would be able to say I've had this I've seen that we've done this we've had that there's signs and wonders but that's not what drives us they gave up the power of God for the power of the state they clung to their own name they made their names great it was that old Spirit of getting everyone into its fold today the Baptists want the Methodist to come over to the Baptist the methodists are out to priz the Presbyterians the Pentecostals want them all each claims to offer the most and to hold out the greatest hopes a sort of Door to Heaven or at least the way to a more abundant entrance how tragic it all is this denominational spirit has made all the denominations write their manuals and teach their Creeds set up their offices and church governments and then each claims that she and she alone truly speaks for God as she is the best qualified now if that isn't exactly what the pope and the Roman Church are are doing they are right back there with their mother the Harlot and don't know it in closing Our Moment our comments on this verse thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead I cannot impress upon you too strongly that in this age though it brought the Reformation as most sternly rebuked by God instead of being praised that it swed the seed of denomination that organized right back to the Harlot I think that's one one statement right there it just sets my soul on fire how we need to make sure that we are sowing the right seeds in the youth in our churches we need to make sure that we are not sowing seeds of doubt that we're not sowing seeds of exclusivity that we're not sowing seeds of division by talking about other people we've talked about it and on we need to make sure we're sewing the right seeds in the children in our church because they are the future of this church if the Lord should T after God had opened the door of Escape when the move away from God sorry when the move away from the Catholic Church took place it was not only truly spiritual as a whole but more political most of the people took up with prostatism because as I have stated they hated the Roman system of political and financial bondage thus instead of this being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of the Holy Spirit influence as when God used purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work wherein the wrath of man praised God and the results paralleled the history of Israel when she she left Egypt and wandered in the desert not making it to Canaan land and why didn't they make it there they murmured they started to complain they started to look at all the natural circumstances and they started to complain they didn't really come right out and curse God what they did was they cursed the guy that God put in place it didn't work out right however much was accomplished in that where the Yoke of home was even partly broken men could now receive the word of God and yield to the influence of the spirit without such great fear as formerly this opened the door to the great missionary age that followed the Jezebel of thyra was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people and thus we see her daughter a athalia raised her head in the sardan age with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seed by her schemes and organization I just think that's an interesting word schemes and uh we know that it's a spirit that's trying to cause people to want to organize that's what the denominational spirit is how we doing for time we're still good the warning Revelations 3:2 Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God I wish it could be said that the sardian age was a restoration instead of a Reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age it's amazing hey but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that's ready to die tragic there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's so beautiful because as I'm reading this as I'm studying it I'm sure every one of us feels that way we have this this is not not something that's missing from our lives we can almost take this for granted if we're not careful we have it that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost not just so that we can be justified not just so that we can be sanctified and live good lives and potentially one day perhaps no the goal is to get the Holy Ghost that is the reason that there is a church that's the reason we come to church brothers and sisters so we can get the Holy Ghost it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost that's why I think it's so beautiful we heard it tonight shake one another's hands as you're seated who whose hands are you shaking really I mean really whose hands are we shaking now this is where it goes crazy this is where we start to become Heretics heretical teachings when we start to say you're shaking the hand of almighty God but but whose Temple are we this is not our own Temple that we can go and just treat and and and feed right and and and act right and and and live right and just be this Temple our bodies are a temple many times people say that even in the world sure enough they are but for what God that's the difference we're here to get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters that's our purpose that is the reason that there is a church it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back upon the church at Pentecost so they did did the works that he did this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word and we've got the revealed word amen that's why brothers and sisters when we say it it's not just a cliche we worship in spirit because we have gone on to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we worship in spirit and the revealed word spirit and Truth this is the Reformation period but fear not little flock God said I will restore and this reform was going to be the start of it I just love this history to think this is where it was starting for us so that we could be here tonight partaking of this my he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the Dark Ages to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost and in the first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this it says in the second verse that I read for I have not found thy works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it's unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back that is why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration it had started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of God oh how Luther preached the sovereignty of God and election he knew it was all of Grace he separated the church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the conf confessions he cast out of the confessions to the priest he denounced the pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God said God had said 1500 years before Luther you're going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to later hallelujah our god reth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as we examine the flaws but there was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say so on the basis of how he acted but God knows how them that are his and he has his way just as he did with Jonah he had his way with Luther in that age and he will have his way until the consummation and I want to say he is having his way tonight now in this now this was an unfulfilled age it was an age of reformation but that's how God wanted it I want to illustrate that to you the way I did to a very wonderful Lutheran brother who was a president of a very fine Seminary out west I had been invited to his place to have dinner with him and to speak to him concerning the Holy Spirit he was puzzled about many things and he said to me what have we Lutheran got I said well you have Christ he said we want the Holy Ghost do you think we got it I said potentially you are believing unto it he said what do you mean potentially we are hungry for God we read a book on Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit and so some of us flew out to California to see the author when we got there he told us that though he had written the book he did not have the gifts now when we saw the operation of gifts in your ministry we wanted to talk to you for you must know something about them isn't that beautiful even the Theologian is is calling upon him saying hey maybe I don't understand you or maybe I can't even believe you but there's something about the works that you're doing there's just something about you Mar now this brother's Seminary is out in the country and surrounded by many acres of Farmland on which the students can work and thereby pay their way through college he also has factories that go along with the farm to give added employment so using his fields to illustrate my case I said once there was a man who went forth on his own ground to plant a field of corn he pulled up the stumps cleared off the Rocks plowed and disced it and then planted his corn each morning he looked out across the field but one morning instead of a Barren ground he saw myriads of little blades coming up he said praise God for my Field of Corn I then asked him did the man have corn he said well in one way he did I said potentially yes and that was you Lutheran in the Reformation putting forth your blade see the corn began to grow after it had rotted in the ground during the Dark Ages after several joints there were fine large stocks and one day a tassel of silk appeared that tassel of silk looked down at the blades and said you old formal lutherans haven't anything look at us we're the Breeders the great missionaries our day is the missionary era that tassel age was the wesleyian age they were the greatest missionaries and even excelled in our age what did that age do it scattered like pollen in the breeze now what is the next step logically we think that is the actual forming and harvesting of the grain the completed cycle but not so there's another stage that stage is when the husk or chaff is formed to cover the seed and that is exactly what happened in this spiritual cycle at the turn of the 20th century in the start of the leodan age there was widespread belief that the Holy Ghost was falling exactly as he did at Pentecost people were talking in tongues and claiming to be baptized with the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues but I have walked in the grain Fields many times and there in late summer I have plucked the heads of Wheat and rubbed them in my hand to get some grain when to my surprise there was wasn't any corn of wheat in that chaff though it indeed it surely looked as if wheat were there isn't that interesting it's such a perfect description it looks exactly like it I was doing that this summer we've got Fields close to our house I was doing that exact thing and and this is just so real it's just so perfect if anybody has a question about this we can actually show you next year here next summer come out we can go out in the field and you'll be able to see it exactly this is a perfect picture of the so-called Pentecostal move and we know I just want to throw this in there brother Bram he said very clearly in the anointed ones at the end time that Satan can impersonate any gift it's important to understand that he can impersonate his speaking in tongues he can heal all of that stuff can happen under the anointing the only one thing he cannot do is accept the word of God he cannot humble himself to the word of God brother bam says it's a perfect picture of the so-called Pentecostal move and that this is proven fact is found in these people organized on a Doctrine and bound themselves right back as did the organization ahead of them proving that instead of being the real seed they were the chaff or protecting cover for the wheat seed which should come this is where I want to throw in there too I just can't help it you know brother brandham said it when we look back in our lives maybe we would say I got the message of the hour I've got the revealed word for my day and I feel so bad for my Methodist grandmother he said don't you think for a second that your shouting Methodist Grandma won't be there because she accepted the word the light for her day you're not going to have a wheat seed without the chaff brothers and sisters don't throw off on the people that don't have a revelation that matches yours we have to have the chaff or you don't have a wheat it was a protecting cover for the wheat seed which should come this chaff stage was the danger period that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 24:24 deceiving the very elect if it were Possible Oh man felt that this husk the so-called Pentecostal age was the true seed but it proved to be just a carrier to carry the life over into the age in which the true restoration comes and the wheat bride is manifested in the power spoken of by Ezekiel 47 I'll call the musicians we'll end off with this scripture here Ezekiel 47:2 to5 then brought he me out of the way by the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that lookth Eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a th cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the lutherans had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification the Methodist had it potentially under sanctification and today it is brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here God bless you tonight maybe stand with me as we close so beautiful today the Holy Ghost is here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever M let's just B bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that your holy spirit is
