[30:23] amen thank you very much are you glad to

[30:29] at the very least you can look into the
[30:32] Bible and
[30:33] say you have responded to his call amen
[30:36] amen you don't ever come before him and
[30:40] lose anything anyway I'm just going to
[30:43] um mention a few announcements here uh
[30:47] March 13th Thursday coming Thursday I
[30:51] think 7:30 is a prayer
[30:53] meeting and then March 23rd 5:30 that's
[30:58] communion so Sunday morning Sunday
[31:00] evening communion and uh just a a
[31:04] friendly reminder Daylight Saving Time
[31:06] begins Saturday into Sunday and so um 1
[31:10] hour we move our clock 1 hour ahead so
[31:13] if you come at a regular 9:30 you'll be
[31:17] 1 hour late so just be mindful of that
[31:21] amen uh please let's have our seats
[31:26] uh like the pastor already announced um
[31:29] we'll be listening to uh Church order
[31:32] today and I think uh it's very important
[31:36] that uh we listen to these things
[31:39] together to so that it's not as if uh
[31:44] somebody's bringing something from
[31:46] somewhere no it's what has been given to
[31:49] us now you understand that if we came
[31:51] all the way here you probably passed by
[31:54] many churches before you got here and
[31:56] there is something that set
[32:00] apart if you ever want to please
[32:03] somebody I think the best way to please
[32:05] the person is to ask the person
[32:08] how and here is the Lord himself coming
[32:11] down to tell us how to serve him how to
[32:14] worship Him how to pleas him I remember
[32:18] we're not trying to copy from how some
[32:20] great denomination did their thing we
[32:23] are not even looking at oh Braham
[32:25] Tabernacle yeah but Braham was there no
[32:27] we are looking at how God wants us to do
[32:30] it amen and as we look at it like the
[32:32] every word of God when it comes it comes
[32:34] with the power to fulfill it and so we
[32:38] are that special people who have been
[32:40] called to do it this way amen that man
[32:44] did not declare it to all the they
[32:45] didn't go around say who can do this and
[32:47] do that and do that and that woman who
[32:49] does that I'll marry her no first of all
[32:52] he called us and I said you are my own
[32:56] this is how I want things to be and so
[32:58] it's good that we all in humility listen
[33:02] and pray for strength there's quite a
[33:04] lot in there for deons um but I think
[33:08] today the good thing is we're doing just
[33:10] about half so it won't be very long and
[33:13] so people will be able to close early so
[33:16] let's just give it all our Focus give it
[33:19] all our attention and may the Lord bless
[33:21] you
[33:45] you be ready to turn them off I motion
[33:47] my head to you like
[33:49] that my motion my head to you
[34:04] Breen we've call this meeting together
[34:07] here tonight for the purpose of knowing
[34:12] how that to operate the Church of the
[34:15] Living
[34:16] God which we believe to be a part of
[34:19] this
[34:20] church and I want to first thing I want
[34:23] to
[34:25] say that in my travels around the world
[34:30] so far as I
[34:32] know this is one h of the most spiritual
[34:37] places where you feel the spirit of God
[34:41] more than any other place I know I had
[34:44] two other places in mine that used to
[34:46] be but so far we we don't uh seem to see
[34:53] those places one of them has went into
[34:54] the
[34:55] organization and the other has uh has
[34:59] kind of fallen so uh I was called uh
[35:04] yesterday and was was told me that you
[35:08] all wanted a meeting to ask me these
[35:10] questions concerning your duties in this
[35:13] church and I um that's what I'm here for
[35:18] tonight is in to set the church or to
[35:22] give to you the things that I think that
[35:25] that is what's substantial
[35:28] to make this church to continue on
[35:31] Brethren I'm sure that you do
[35:34] realize that is I've made this remark
[35:37] about uh this being a spiritual place it
[35:40] isn't the biggest place in the world and
[35:43] it isn't what we have the most singing
[35:45] the most screaming and the most
[35:46] hollering or the most speaking in
[35:49] tongues and that isn't it but it's the
[35:53] quality of the spirit that's operates
[35:56] here in this Tabernacle
[35:58] and so far I want to command and thank
[36:01] brother Neville and and you Brethren
[36:04] here trustees and deacons and Sunday
[36:07] school superintendent and all for for
[36:09] what you have done and helping keeping
[36:12] this us away it's been a long prayer a
[36:15] mind and a desire since a boy to see the
[36:18] church put in order and kept in order
[36:21] now we dedicated the church I told you a
[36:24] little later I had something to talk to
[36:27] you about how to set this thing in order
[36:31] the way it should be run and um you
[36:35] started off uh after leaving here we had
[36:38] ministers and so forth but now brother
[36:41] Neville being just young Among Us come
[36:43] Among Us I thought it'd be better for
[36:45] brother Neville to get better
[36:47] established in the faith before I
[36:49] presented such things as I'm about to do
[36:51] now but now after I find out that he is
[36:55] uh getting well established in the faith
[36:57] and understands what the doctrine is and
[37:00] and has uh played the part of a faithful
[37:03] witness to Christ and holding for what
[37:05] we believe to be the truth I think it's
[37:08] the hour now would be a good time to
[37:11] approach him and among you elders and
[37:14] things for the church that you would
[37:18] take these orders and remember them
[37:20] they're the best of my knowledge before
[37:22] God and then I'm looking to you to carry
[37:26] these things out
[37:28] the way that I'm seeing because somebody
[37:30] has to be a head around here you have to
[37:33] have now I'm not trying to assert
[37:35] Authority or something like that but you
[37:38] see a man or anything with two heads to
[37:41] it it it doesn't know how to go God
[37:43] never did have two heads to his church
[37:46] he never did it's one head he always
[37:48] dealt in every generation as we've
[37:50] studied through the scriptures there's
[37:52] always one individual that he deals with
[37:55] because you get two men you got two
[37:57] opinions
[37:58] it's got to come to one final
[38:01] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[38:06] Bible and as a pastor here of the church
[38:10] my absolute is the word and I will I
[38:13] know you are brothers you kind of look
[38:15] to me to be your absolute to what as
[38:18] long as I follow God as Paul said in the
[38:20] scripture you follow me as I follow
[38:23] Christ and then I'd expect you Brethren
[38:26] at any time that you see me to get away
[38:29] from this scripture to come to me
[38:31] privately and tell me or I'm wrong I
[38:33] don't care if you're one of the trusties
[38:36] if you're the janitor whoever you are
[38:38] your duty bound to me as a brother in
[38:41] Christ to tell me when I'm wrong
[38:44] scripturally if it's a question let's
[38:47] sit down and solve it out together
[38:49] that's why you've come I suppose to me
[38:51] tonight brought me in here is because
[38:54] that there's questions here that seems
[38:56] to be questioning you in your your mind
[38:58] for the things that I have have here I
[39:01] remember Brethren I don't know there's
[39:03] no name signed on any of these tickets
[39:06] but and they're wrote and I can't don't
[39:08] know who wrote them but their questions
[39:11] that's on your mind and I'm here to
[39:13] answer them the best of my knowledge and
[39:16] remember God is looking to me to see
[39:19] that I stay in the word and I'm looking
[39:22] to you to see that you carry out the
[39:24] word see in this church and keep it
[39:28] spiritual for remember all the forces of
[39:33] of the dark kingdom of Satan will be
[39:36] turned against you as you begin to grow
[39:39] and the LA and you must be soldiers not
[39:44] just fresh recruits you're age soldiers
[39:48] now I've been trained to fight and Satan
[39:51] will come among you cause you to dispute
[39:53] with one another if you can turn him
[39:55] down just immediately youing breing and
[39:58] it's the enemy and we're here to hold a
[40:02] standard in this evening light time that
[40:06] when the world is darken and the whole
[40:09] church kingdom is going into the Council
[40:11] of churches and pretty soon they'll try
[40:15] to tack a sign on this door you're
[40:17] closed then we're going to have to meet
[40:21] other places because they'll certainly
[40:23] close these churches one of these days
[40:24] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[40:27] and uh we're depending on staying true
[40:31] to god Till Death sets us free and
[40:34] that's what we intend to do now straight
[40:37] to the and I would ask that if ever a
[40:41] time that any of these things come into
[40:44] question that this tape may be played
[40:47] before the members of this church at
[40:50] your meetings or prayer of the meeting
[40:52] just before the meeting starts turn this
[40:54] tape on and play it and may the
[40:57] congregation here understand that these
[41:00] men are Duty bound to God is there oath
[41:04] in this church to help hold these
[41:06] principles you may disagree with them
[41:10] and if I let you run it then I disagree
[41:13] with you we've got to have some Source
[41:15] somewhere where there's got to be an
[41:17] ultimate and the best that I know I'm
[41:20] giving it under the Holy Spirit letting
[41:23] him be my ultimate and let this P be
[41:26] your ultimate on these
[41:29] questions now the first one is how shall
[41:32] the church act towards calls for
[41:35] financial help uh for food and
[41:41] clothing what's what act what what
[41:46] should the church do now we realize that
[41:50] the church is responsible for its own
[41:54] for our members here of the church we
[41:57] are are
[41:58] totally responsible as far as we have
[42:01] needs to supply them with we are
[42:04] responsible for our own that's steady
[42:08] constant members of the Tabernacle come
[42:11] here and worship with us we are Duty
[42:14] bound to them as our brothers and
[42:15] sisters who have proven to be our
[42:18] members of this
[42:20] Gathering now we realize that there is
[42:24] millions tonight without food without
[42:27] without clothing and we would love to be
[42:29] able to help the whole group of them to
[42:31] do everything we could but financially
[42:34] we cannot do that we can't support all
[42:37] the world but we are Duty bound to our
[42:40] own and I think in that and then if we
[42:43] have anything left over that you would
[42:46] want to contribute to people who are
[42:49] not members here of this church
[42:52] something that you want to give to them
[42:56] it should be met between the the board
[42:59] of the
[43:01] deacons the deacons is the one that that
[43:04] has to meet this opposition or this
[43:07] problem rather because that in the Bible
[43:12] when the dispute come up about food and
[43:15] clothing and so forth in the book of
[43:17] Acts they call the apostles in about it
[43:20] they said go look out for yourself uh s
[43:24] a man of honest report and full of the
[43:26] Holy ghost that they might attend to
[43:29] these things because we will give
[43:31] ourselves continually to the word of God
[43:33] and in prayer and it isn't the pastor's
[43:37] duty to look out to the uh for the food
[43:41] and so forth that's supposed to be by
[43:43] the deacons it isn't the
[43:45] trustees it is the Deacon's office to do
[43:48] this and then this should be remember in
[43:51] the Bible they was contributing to their
[43:54] own the Greeks and the and the Jewish
[43:59] where the argument come up that one was
[44:00] getting a little more than the other but
[44:02] it was people who had sold all their
[44:04] goods and given into the church for its
[44:09] support and then to to be divided out
[44:12] among them equally and there was a
[44:14] little dispute come up and there's where
[44:16] we got our first deacons and that's one
[44:18] of their duties is to do that I think
[44:22] that as our own as our own people uh we
[44:25] should take care of them and it should
[44:27] be turned in any complaint to the
[44:29] chairman of the deacon board and then it
[44:32] should be met by the Deacon board and
[44:34] see what they're able to do about it and
[44:37] all of those things which is clothing
[44:40] and food and financial help or whatever
[44:43] it is should come through the deacons
[44:45] then the deacons when they decide that
[44:48] they are that they are what they're
[44:50] going to do about it then it should be
[44:52] presented then unto the uh the treasure
[44:56] the SE if the treasure is able at this
[44:59] time to pay this certain amount of
[45:01] Finance or or buy these clothing or
[45:04] whatever it is to that but the the
[45:06] Deacon board should meet on that and it
[45:08] doesn't go to the trustees or to the
[45:11] pastor it's a Deacon's thing
[45:14] altoe now then question number two is it
[45:19] s sufficient to say openly from the
[45:23] pulpit that tongues and interpretation
[45:27] should be done in a meeting before the
[45:31] service that's the second question on
[45:34] this uh slip of paper that I have here
[45:36] which is a little card now this would be
[45:41] uh pertaining to the pastor here see
[45:44] because he after all over the spiritual
[45:47] part he's the head of that deacons are
[45:50] policemen in the church to keep order
[45:52] and to take care of these things and
[45:53] feeding the poor and so forth the
[45:55] trustees are over the Finance in the
[45:57] building that's what they he to look at
[45:59] but the pastor is over the the
[46:03] supervising of the spiritual part and
[46:06] this would go to you brother nible now
[46:10] there some time ago when the uh order
[46:15] was set the
[46:16] church uh I do believe in speaking in
[46:20] tongues and interpretation and all the
[46:22] fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of
[46:24] God to be in the church
[46:27] but we are living in a day just like it
[46:31] was in the Bible time where the churches
[46:35] now you notice Paul he founded the
[46:38] church at Ephesus the Ephesian Church
[46:40] which is a wellestablished church did
[46:43] you notice we believe that Paul and did
[46:46] say so himself that he spoke with many
[46:49] tongues and we know that he had gifts of
[46:51] tongues not ones that he had learned but
[46:54] those who were spiritually given to him
[46:55] because High speaks it in Corinthians
[46:58] there and the same time I'm not just
[47:00] turning in the Bible and reading it for
[47:02] you because it would make our our stay
[47:04] here too long tonight as I don't have
[47:06] too much time and now but just so that
[47:09] you could openly see
[47:12] now uh Paul never one time had to speak
[47:16] to the Ephesian church or to the Roman
[47:18] church or any of those other churches
[47:20] about their spiritual gifts about how to
[47:22] put them in order but he did have to
[47:24] speak to the Corinthians continually
[47:27] about it because they made it an issue
[47:29] all the time and Paul said when he come
[47:32] among them if uh they found out one had
[47:35] a tongue and one had a Psalm and he
[47:38] thanked the Lord for all their fine
[47:40] gifts and things like that and if you
[47:42] notice in the first chapter or two of
[47:44] Corinthians Paul was telling
[47:46] positionally what they were in Christ
[47:48] how he they were positionally in Christ
[47:50] then after he told him L like a father
[47:54] he be to let the whip down on him and
[47:56] say I hear hear there contentions among
[47:57] you and I hear that you get drunk at the
[48:00] Lord's table he didn't UNC christianize
[48:02] them and don't you Brethren do that un
[48:05] christianize them but it's the way
[48:07] they're behaving themselves in the house
[48:10] of God that's where it said now I would
[48:13] say this that as Paul of old said that
[48:17] when you come together if one speaks let
[48:20] another uh interpret there be no
[48:23] interpreter then hold your peace but if
[48:25] there be an interpreter now I've watched
[48:27] The church here and I've seen you grow
[48:30] up I've seen many spiritual gifts
[48:32] operating among you frankly one I had to
[48:34] come to brother neev about with a word
[48:36] from the Lord to correct him on
[48:38] something that he was doing and if I if
[48:41] the Lord is the Holy Ghost is made me an
[48:43] overseer of the flock then it's my duty
[48:46] to tell you the truth and I'm very
[48:49] grateful for brother Neville he heeded
[48:51] to the truth I can only say it as he
[48:52] tells me now on this as I've noticed
[48:56] your church growing
[48:57] and noticed it and in the church here's
[49:00] the way we had it first and this the way
[49:02] we we want it again now if you don't
[49:05] watch when babies the first thing a baby
[49:08] does is try to talk when he can't talk
[49:12] he makes a lot of bubble and noise and
[49:15] and so forth but he thinks he's just he
[49:18] can out talk the preacher at that time
[49:21] well we find that not only in the
[49:22] natural life but we find that in the
[49:25] spiritual life also it's a little one
[49:28] and if you try to correct that baby and
[49:30] spank him a little bit because he gooing
[49:33] and trying to talk you'll ruin the child
[49:36] and you'll hurt him and it's best to let
[49:39] that baby grow a little while until he
[49:42] actually can speak his words right and
[49:43] then tell him when not when Papa's
[49:45] talking or When Mama's talking but when
[49:48] it's appropriate time let him have his
[49:51] say you understand me now let him talk
[49:55] when his time comes to talk now if I've
[49:59] ever had anything that's been a thorn in
[50:01] my flesh out in the meeting is someone
[50:03] to rise up when I'm speaking and then
[50:06] give a message in tongues and break the
[50:08] spirit I've just come out a meeting in
[50:10] New York and different places to where
[50:13] ministers let that go on time after time
[50:16] and it's nothing but but a confusion see
[50:20] when God is dealing in one line of
[50:22] thought he it would be it would he would
[50:26] be defeated meting his own purpose if
[50:28] he's trying to get a line of thought to
[50:30] you to the congregation to make an alar
[50:32] calling something bu him for instance
[50:34] like this we're sitting at the table
[50:37] talking and we're talking uh about the
[50:40] Lord and Junior runs into the table real
[50:43] quick takes all the attention away from
[50:45] what we're doing and hollers scream out
[50:48] dad mom m I just hit a home run down the
[50:52] team and we doing all this that and the
[50:53] other and when we're right on a real
[50:57] write down sacred subject now him
[51:01] hitting a home run that's all right at
[51:03] the baseball game that's all right but
[51:05] he's out of
[51:06] order when he breaks in on the message
[51:09] that we're talking about let him wait
[51:11] till his time comes and then tell us
[51:13] what he did at the baseball game now
[51:15] that's just the same thing we find with
[51:17] gifts today that's the reason God cannot
[51:20] trust to many spiritual gifts with
[51:21] people they don't know how to control
[51:22] them that's what's the matter today the
[51:25] reason we don't have no more than we do
[51:27] and we do find there's a lot of
[51:28] impersonation of spiritual gifts but I
[51:31] don't believe that's so here in our
[51:32] church I'm thankful for that I don't
[51:34] believe it's an impersonation at all I
[51:36] believe we have genuine gifts but we
[51:38] must know how to control those gifts
[51:40] then when you go to doing something good
[51:41] just like you working for a boss and you
[51:43] start out on the first year job and
[51:45] you're willing to take
[51:47] orders then the boss has confidence in
[51:50] you and will'll keep raising you up to a
[51:52] higher office all the time I believe
[51:55] that time has struck the random
[51:57] Tabernacle to know what to take the
[51:59] gifts that God gives us that God can
[52:02] trust us with something even greater and
[52:04] what we have got but we cannot uh go
[52:08] along and you see a man that's always
[52:10] have to be tell him and everything and
[52:12] remember the spirit of the prophets is
[52:15] subject to the prophet says the
[52:18] scripture when you see a man that you
[52:20] have to correct or a woman and that
[52:23] person gets out of order and then you're
[52:26] telling him the scriptural truth then it
[52:29] shows that the spirit that's on him
[52:31] isn't of God because the Bible said the
[52:34] spirit of the
[52:35] prophets are prophesying that's
[52:38] testifying preaching speaking in tongues
[52:40] or whatever it is C tongues interpreted
[52:43] is prophecy so it's subject to the
[52:47] prophet and the word is the
[52:50] prophet so we we see that it's out of
[52:54] order for a man or woman to jump up and
[52:57] give a message no matter how much they
[52:59] want to do it while a preacher is in the
[53:04] Pulpit now I suggest this for the
[53:07] brandom
[53:09] Tabernacle that being that our our gifts
[53:12] that we find and we have some very fine
[53:15] gifted people here now each one of those
[53:18] gifts are a Ministry of their
[53:21] own they are gifts just like preaching
[53:24] is a gift like healing is a gift like
[53:28] other things are gifts these are gifts
[53:31] they are Ministries all their own and
[53:34] each man is commanded to wait on his own
[53:39] Ministry therefore let the brand of
[53:42] tabernac will be operated like this and
[53:44] in the day especially this day when
[53:47] we've had so
[53:48] much um I don't want to say this but so
[53:51] much make
[53:53] belief we don't want make belief no man
[53:56] no honest person wants to have a make
[53:59] belief we if we don't can't have the
[54:01] real let's not have any at all let's
[54:03] wait till we do get the real I believe
[54:06] you you man would agree with that we
[54:08] don't want nothing make believe brethren
[54:10] we can't start on make believe something
[54:11] and leave in this world we got to have
[54:14] what's real what's genuine if we haven't
[54:17] got it let's wait till we do get it and
[54:19] then say something about it see
[54:22] now I would say let all these men and
[54:25] women who speak in tongues and prophesy
[54:29] and give messages and I I'm believing
[54:33] with you man if they are
[54:35] genuine
[54:37] now the Bible has said prove all things
[54:40] and hold fast to that what's good for
[54:43] with stammer lips and other tongues will
[54:44] I speak to this people this is the rest
[54:47] that I said that they should enter into
[54:50] over in the book of Isaiah
[54:53] now I would suggest this so that the
[54:57] sanctuary will only be ministered by one
[55:00] gift at a time for it brings us straight
[55:03] back in order again of what I'm trying
[55:04] to say if one Speaking let the spirit of
[55:07] the prophets be subject to the prophet
[55:11] do you understand now let those who have
[55:15] a Ministry to the body of
[55:17] Christ and now it's being said now let
[55:21] it be done let those who have a
[55:24] Ministry to the body of Christ
[55:27] wait on their Ministry because it is a
[55:30] Ministry from Christ to the
[55:33] church but you can't all Minister the
[55:36] same time there's got to be one at a
[55:40] time the Brandon Tabernacle should be
[55:43] like this let those who speak with
[55:45] tongues and those who interpret tongues
[55:48] and those have
[55:50] prophecy that's to be given to the
[55:52] church let them come among among
[55:56] themselves early in the before the
[55:59] meeting starts let them Gather in an
[56:02] appointed room and wait on the ministry
[56:05] of the Lord as the pastor has to do
[56:08] himself before he comes into the
[56:11] audience he must take the Bible study in
[56:15] the quietness of his room in the spirit
[56:18] and be anointed to come out before the
[56:21] audience to speak if he doesn't he's
[56:24] going to be confused when he gets out
[56:26] out there let each man and each woman
[56:29] with a spiritual gift come before the
[56:32] Lord and being that the pastor has a
[56:35] single Ministry he is a prophet the
[56:39] English word a preacher means a prophet
[56:42] that's a fourth teller of the
[56:45] word let those who have Ministries that
[56:49] has to be part of someone else like one
[56:53] to speak with tongues and another to
[56:55] interpret they they wait together on
[56:57] their Ministry they cannot stay in a
[56:59] private study and speak in tongues and
[57:02] then come tell the other what he said
[57:03] because he'd have both tongues and
[57:06] interpretation now if he has that very
[57:09] well we want it to receive it like that
[57:12] and we want the church to benefit by
[57:14] these gifts that's in our church God
[57:17] sent them to us and it's we want our
[57:20] church to benefit by these spiritual
[57:22] gifts so let the man who speaks with
[57:25] tongues and the one who interprets and
[57:29] the one who prophesies let them come
[57:32] together before the the church ever
[57:36] meets let them meet in a room to
[57:39] themselves waiting on the ministry of
[57:42] the Lord to the
[57:44] church is it
[57:46] understood and
[57:48] then like this if brother Neville say
[57:52] well I let me pardon me let me say this
[57:54] if brother Collins speaks with Tong
[57:57] and brother Hickerson gives the
[58:01] interpretation
[58:03] then they have a Ministry together for
[58:06] the
[58:08] church now that isn't the ministry of
[58:10] brother
[58:11] nabal that's your ministry to the church
[58:15] I'm giving this as example then you
[58:17] Brethren should be just as interested in
[58:20] getting your ministry in the place in
[58:24] the house of God as the pastor Pastor is
[58:27] interested in getting his because it's
[58:28] just essential that you do it but you
[58:32] can't do it in the privacy of your own
[58:34] room if you speak and you interpret
[58:36] you've got to come
[58:38] together now come together in the church
[58:42] off in a room to yourself because you
[58:44] have a private Ministry it's not an
[58:46] openly Ministry it's one that's to help
[58:50] the church see it's something to help
[58:52] the church but it isn't to be done in
[58:54] the main congregation only the way I'm
[58:56] going to tell you is to be done see then
[58:59] whatever brother Collins speaks and
[59:02] brother Hickerson gives the
[59:03] interpretation as example then let
[59:07] brother uh somebody write this down what
[59:10] it
[59:12] is and
[59:14] then if it's coming now we all know that
[59:18] the Lord is coming we're aware of
[59:21] that and if brother Neville got up each
[59:24] night and said behold the Lord is coming
[59:27] behold the Lord is coming that would be
[59:28] all right see but he's saying that the
[59:32] pastor at the platform for he's got the
[59:35] word for that and if he be a pastor
[59:39] Prophet to the church or Pastor rather
[59:42] he's to study the word of the Lord and
[59:44] tell you what's written in the word of
[59:46] the Lord about the coming of the Lord
[59:48] and you're warned by
[59:50] that a Ministry otherwise to the church
[59:53] which he wouldn't have any connection
[59:55] with is tongues interpretation of
[59:57] tongues which is prophecy or a prophet
[1:00:00] speaking that's something is not written
[1:00:03] in the
[1:00:04] word what's written in the word he's to
[1:00:07] bring it but what's not written in the
[1:00:09] word is what you're to tell him like for
[1:00:11] instance uh tell um brother wheeler of
[1:00:15] thus sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his
[1:00:18] sandpit not to go to it because you'll
[1:00:20] be a truck turnover or something like
[1:00:22] that and it's got to be done and you've
[1:00:24] spoken and he's interpreted and then lay
[1:00:26] that on the platform after your ministry
[1:00:29] is finished the other night after the
[1:00:31] church the hymn starts singing and so
[1:00:33] forth if your ministry is finished then
[1:00:36] let them come forth with what prophecy
[1:00:37] has been
[1:00:39] given and I do not think that we have or
[1:00:42] if you do put this in there when these
[1:00:44] people meet together let them who have
[1:00:47] wisdom first come because you see if one
[1:00:50] speaks in tongues and gives an
[1:00:52] interpretation according to scripture
[1:00:54] that cannot be received unless be uh
[1:00:57] witnessed by two or three people two or
[1:00:59] three more witnesses see has to witness
[1:01:02] to that that they believe it to be the
[1:01:03] word of the Lord because sometimes in
[1:01:06] these minor Ministries just like in any
[1:01:08] other Ministry you get Spirits that's
[1:01:10] wrong see they'll fly in there and we
[1:01:12] don't want
[1:01:14] that no we want these Ministries ready
[1:01:17] to be exposed if they to be exposed
[1:01:19] because anything of God can don't worry
[1:01:21] about exposing it it'll it'll stand the
[1:01:23] test if it's of God it's like the pastor
[1:01:26] if somebody challenges him on the word
[1:01:28] he don't have to back up about it you
[1:01:29] know just exactly what he's talking to
[1:01:31] come on up here see and same as these
[1:01:33] other Ministries got to be the same way
[1:01:36] now if if one speaks in tongues and
[1:01:38] gives a message now some people speak in
[1:01:41] tongues when they're just edifying
[1:01:43] themselves the Bible say they just have
[1:01:45] a good time to speak in tongues they
[1:01:47] feel and they do speak in tongues they
[1:01:49] actually speak with tongues and it's the
[1:01:52] spirit doing it but if it's sitting out
[1:01:55] there in the audience of speaking in
[1:01:57] tongues just edifying themselves then it
[1:01:59] isn't any profitable thing for the
[1:02:01] church the man's edifying himself or the
[1:02:03] woman whoever is doing it see to speak
[1:02:06] in tongues as a gift of God to
[1:02:09] edification as Paul says in the
[1:02:11] scripture that it's to edify the church
[1:02:13] so it had to be some direct message from
[1:02:15] God to the church outside of what's
[1:02:18] wrote here in the
[1:02:20] Bible see it's something if you could
[1:02:22] ask me brother brandom uh how must I be
[1:02:26] baptized I can tell you right quick you
[1:02:27] don't have to speak in tongues and tell
[1:02:28] me that it's wrote right here in the
[1:02:30] Bible what to do about that see I don't
[1:02:32] have you don't have to ask no questions
[1:02:34] on that have somebody speak in tongues
[1:02:35] and tell you see that's already written
[1:02:38] but if you say brother Brandon uh what
[1:02:41] must I do I've got a decision here I've
[1:02:43] got to make whether I should U uh take
[1:02:46] this church or go to another church or
[1:02:48] something like that or should I do this
[1:02:50] now that have to come from God see God
[1:02:53] has to tell us that but that would have
[1:02:55] to come to another Ministry because the
[1:02:57] word don't say let arm and nille leave
[1:03:00] brandom Tabernacle and go to the Fort
[1:03:02] wind Gospel Tabernacle see they don't
[1:03:05] say that in the word here see so that's
[1:03:07] what these gifts are for like a person
[1:03:09] come up here and say you believe in
[1:03:11] Divine Healing we preach that we believe
[1:03:12] it we believe in nor and the all but
[1:03:14] here some man says he can't get through
[1:03:16] what's the matter then it takes God
[1:03:18] through tongues interpretation through
[1:03:20] prophecy or some way to go down in that
[1:03:23] man's life and pull out that thing that
[1:03:25] he's done and tell him about that's a
[1:03:27] Ministry that doesn't belong to the
[1:03:29] pastor it belongs to these ministering
[1:03:33] gifts but they're not to be done out
[1:03:35] there in the audience see now Paul
[1:03:37] remember one time had to tell those tell
[1:03:40] those Ephesian Church anything about
[1:03:41] that
[1:04:16] amen and too glad to hear from your lord
[1:04:20] in such direct ways am praise the name
[1:04:23] of the Lord I mean
[1:04:26] God has chosen to address
[1:04:29] us there is no it's not in a parable
[1:04:32] form we don't have to learn Greek or we
[1:04:35] don't have to learn Hebrew or anything
[1:04:37] it's just simple direct
[1:04:39] straightforward praise the name of the
[1:04:40] Lord that is how a husband speaks to the
[1:04:44] wife and I'm saying the wife not the
[1:04:46] bride the wife praise the name of the
[1:04:48] Lord and so that is it I think it's it's
[1:04:51] very straightforward and that places the
[1:04:53] responsibility on us right now as what
[1:04:56] we do with that word that has been given
[1:04:58] to us
[1:04:59] hallelujah um you know for most there
[1:05:02] may
[1:05:04] be many meetings this night or other
[1:05:08] nights this uh this week all over the
[1:05:13] town but at least we can look into the
[1:05:16] scripture and say that where the carcass
[1:05:19] is there the Eagles will be guided amen
[1:05:22] and so when you see yourself here
[1:05:26] especially you have the Revelation that
[1:05:28] this is that carcass this is the fresh
[1:05:31] meat now I don't deny there's meat out
[1:05:33] there Frozen maybe salted maybe but the
[1:05:37] fresh the carcass is here praise the
[1:05:40] name of the Lord and you see you get the
[1:05:42] best from it when you understand the
[1:05:45] value of what we are receiving praise
[1:05:48] the name of the Lord so when the Lord
[1:05:50] comes in very simple terms nothing
[1:05:53] nothing complicated
[1:05:56] no I I feel like it's just a blessing to
[1:05:59] have a prophet and I don't say this LLY
[1:06:02] but a prophet who didn't have too much
[1:06:04] education because that makes it break
[1:06:07] the thing down in so simple it's not
[1:06:09] subject to any any any argument at all
[1:06:12] amen praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:06:15] when it comes it's our obedience right
[1:06:18] now that is our stake amen hallelujah
[1:06:21] and if you realize the word of God
[1:06:22] always comes with the power to obey
[1:06:26] now I just want to mention two things
[1:06:28] that stood out for me I think the first
[1:06:32] part and I think it's the most important
[1:06:34] important part is that he says that he
[1:06:37] waited until they were established in
[1:06:39] the
[1:06:40] faith without being established in the
[1:06:42] faith all these things will be
[1:06:45] just a routine thing that we're doing
[1:06:48] without conviction and it's not pleasing
[1:06:50] to the Lord and a lot of times that is
[1:06:53] where problem comes right when we have
[1:06:56] to do something I have to come and stand
[1:06:58] here what am I going to say let me find
[1:06:59] the right words let me and then when I'm
[1:07:01] focused too much on that it doesn't seem
[1:07:04] sincere again and the Lord is not in it
[1:07:07] right oh yeah I have to sing well let's
[1:07:10] see what is on the video and this and
[1:07:12] the actions they did and okay and then
[1:07:14] you do that and by the time you finish
[1:07:17] the sincerity is gone and God is done in
[1:07:19] it amen and so the first thing is
[1:07:21] established in the faith and I think
[1:07:24] that is what the beginning of it that he
[1:07:27] waited he had all this but he waited and
[1:07:29] then the next the second thing is when
[1:07:31] he says that the place is the most
[1:07:33] spiritual place he
[1:07:35] being it's very very important that he
[1:07:39] he points out that he's the most
[1:07:41] spiritual he doesn't say it's because of
[1:07:45] the songs they sing he doesn't say it's
[1:07:47] the biggest place he doesn't say it's
[1:07:49] because of tongues or anything no he
[1:07:53] says it's the quality of the spirit
[1:07:56] the attitude and the solemnness with
[1:07:58] which they approach the place so if we
[1:08:01] catch a revelation of what goes on here
[1:08:03] I think the benefits will be
[1:08:05] enormous and this is this is it we are
[1:08:08] the people called to hold this standard
[1:08:10] yes this a stand that he talks to the
[1:08:12] extent of saying we should make a
[1:08:15] reference to it if there is anything we
[1:08:17] should go back to the T So for sure he
[1:08:19] knew that this was not just for that
[1:08:21] church praise the name of the Lord so
[1:08:24] let's be mindful of this
[1:08:26] and and let's let's yield ourselves to
[1:08:28] it there is so much coming from here and
[1:08:31] I know if we yield ourselves we're going
[1:08:33] to read benefits that we've not seen yet
[1:08:37] praise the name of the Lord I'll call
[1:08:40] the musicians so that
[1:08:45] me now there is a PRI that says let's
[1:08:48] take this tape I said let this day be
[1:08:51] your ultimate on these topics right and
[1:08:56] so if I bring oh yeah this code says
[1:08:59] this and the other one says no it says
[1:09:00] that and this one says this well after
[1:09:03] all that what does this tape say right
[1:09:06] because it says let that be your
[1:09:08] ultimate praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:15] hallelujah let's sing faithful one
[1:09:21] [Music]
