[44:06] children of Israel to eat things
[44:08] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[44:12] fornication so hast thou also them that
[44:16] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[44:18] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[44:22] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[44:24] them with the sword of my
[44:27] mouth he that hath an ear let him hear
[44:30] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[44:33] to him that overcometh will I give to
[44:35] eat of the Hidden mana and will give him
[44:38] a white stone and in the stone a new
[44:42] name written which no man knoweth s
[44:45] saving he that receiveth
[44:48] it let's just bow one more time am
[44:52] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you
[44:54] that there's a new name given amen to
[44:57] your children and Lord to those who are
[44:59] willing to receive it father and if
[45:01] we're willing to receive it it's only by
[45:03] your grace that we heard because that
[45:05] blood was presented Lord Jesus and we
[45:08] know that it causes us oh Father to to
[45:11] go and tell you Lord Jesus how much we
[45:14] love you father tonight we love you and
[45:16] we just want to ask father for a special
[45:18] anointing on this service Lord that you
[45:20] would take the words that are spoken and
[45:22] father use them for your glory speak to
[45:25] your children one more time father don't
[45:28] forget about me I pray Lord we love you
[45:30] we thank you we just ask all these
[45:32] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[45:34] pray amen am God bless you tonight you
[45:37] may be
[45:38] seated we're certainly glad to be back
[45:40] as I was
[45:42] mentioning as usual I get a little bit
[45:44] excited when I get into the pulpit
[45:45] especially with a a song like that you
[45:48] know um we're going to get into worship
[45:51] and uh I'm just certainly excited about
[45:54] it it's a wonderful thing it's our
[45:55] opportunity to express our love back to
[45:59] him and uh you know many people can say
[46:02] it should be a certain way and that it
[46:03] shouldn't be the other way and you know
[46:06] I think it's just up to the individual
[46:08] and we need to make sure that we just
[46:11] are not hindering the spirit when he
[46:13] wants to come on the scene because
[46:15] really the fruit of our lips is his
[46:18] Spirit manifesting through US amen and
[46:21] when we refuse that that is not a good
[46:23] thing but boy when we can actually offer
[46:25] it what what a blessing because you know
[46:29] it it's one thing to have the word in
[46:30] print and and to have the word in in
[46:33] audible format where we can press play
[46:36] and and listen to it but you know he's
[46:39] not looking for that he's he's not
[46:41] looking for the books and he's not
[46:43] looking for the tapes and he's not
[46:44] looking for the Bible he's not looking
[46:47] for print form he is print form what
[46:49] he's looking for is praise that's what
[46:52] he's looking for and we need to be that
[46:54] Living Word and give him that praise
[46:57] amen hallelujah we were away last
[46:59] weekend uh last Sunday when brother Toby
[47:02] took the service I thought it was just a
[47:03] wonderful service by the way we have to
[47:06] have the right foundation and if we
[47:07] don't have that right foundation it's
[47:09] not going to turn out right and uh you
[47:11] know just one little quote that brother
[47:13] Toby brought um from the message where
[47:16] brother bradam talks about that girl
[47:17] that got mixed up in her relationship
[47:19] and she married a man got after the man
[47:22] and and and What attracted her to him
[47:24] was his feet she said he had cute feet
[47:29] and that he smelled
[47:30] good can you imagine that brother
[47:33] brandham said I'd rather smell like a
[47:35] pole cat and have hands like a gravel or
[47:37] feet like a gravel truck than uh than be
[47:41] that way um we have to make sure that we
[47:44] have the right right right step right we
[47:46] have to make sure that we're we're
[47:48] looking for the character of Jesus
[47:50] Christ am and and I thought it was so
[47:52] good the way brother Toby brought it
[47:54] just a tremendous blessing to the body
[47:56] part one and to um as mentioned we went
[48:00] to a a little birthday party for a bunch
[48:02] of folks I think there was four people
[48:04] that turned 70 this year and uh I should
[48:08] be able to name them all but I probably
[48:10] won't be able to but it was out at a
[48:11] farm in Saskatchewan it was the berries
[48:14] and uh brother Jean and sister Bev uh
[48:17] sturby that used to attend here um it's
[48:20] actually her family she used to be a
[48:23] berry that was her maiden name so her
[48:25] brothers still live on the Family farm
[48:27] and it's I think just about a Heritage
[48:29] Farm they've been there since the early
[48:31] 1900s and um two of her brothers still
[48:35] live there and actively Farm it they
[48:36] have cattle and they had a birthday
[48:38] party there and a couple of people
[48:40] camped and it was just a wonderful time
[48:42] to see uh many Believers there and just
[48:46] to see them we haven't seen them for
[48:47] many years and uh just to have some some
[48:50] conversation and break break bread with
[48:52] them something special about eating
[48:54] together and so we really enjoyed the
[48:57] time away there so thank you very much
[48:58] for everyone that looked after things in
[49:00] our
[49:01] stead I would like to get into the uh
[49:04] the scripture but I see I still have
[49:06] some announcements we've got the youth
[49:07] hike this weekend um the 9th and the
[49:09] 10th Friday and Saturday um Junction
[49:13] Creek Falls is the event and uh I think
[49:16] the youth chat has all the information
[49:18] for those people that are going brother
[49:20] Andrew Glover will be here August 16th
[49:23] 17th and 18th um as far as I know
[49:26] everything everything is scheduled to go
[49:28] and we're certainly excited to see him
[49:30] again and to hear what the Lord has put
[49:33] on his
[49:34] heart are you happy
[49:36] tonight I think it's a wonderful thing
[49:38] brother Toby said it I didn't even
[49:40] realize it I never had thought of it
[49:42] that way but truly it is that way we
[49:45] need to be able to ask our spouse are
[49:46] you happy and we've got to be willing to
[49:49] actually accept the response and and
[49:52] then if if the response includes us then
[49:54] we've got to be willing to maybe do
[49:56] something something to try and help
[49:58] change that or or fix that and you know
[50:01] I I I
[50:02] certainly I know that if I I ask my wife
[50:06] that I I have to be willing to accept
[50:09] the the answer that she gives me and and
[50:11] I truly hope that she's happy
[50:14] and sometimes I know she's not but you
[50:17] know one thing that can happen which uh
[50:20] it's kind of sad but it's just human
[50:22] nature is when we know that she's not
[50:24] happy I ain't going to ask her are you
[50:26] happy
[50:27] why would I do that I
[50:30] mean but sometimes we're just not sure
[50:33] sometimes we just don't know and and
[50:35] it's good to express our joy it's
[50:37] wonderful to be able to ask the question
[50:40] and and not be afraid to have the
[50:41] relationship it's important so anyways
[50:45] getting into the word tonight I want to
[50:47] pick up in the seven Church ages the
[50:48] exposition of the seven Church ages from
[50:50] the pergami church age we left off at
[50:53] paragraph 79 last time brother Bram he
[50:56] says now I want you to be very careful
[50:59] here and see this this is still lot of
[51:02] pick up your pen and write and uh boy I
[51:04] could go back and do a whole recap but I
[51:06] want to try and push forward here um I
[51:10] want you to be very careful here and see
[51:12] this he says God has promised that at
[51:15] the end time Malachi 4 is going to be
[51:19] fulfilled and how did he promise it
[51:22] through a
[51:23] prophet
[51:25] God has prom promised that at the end
[51:27] time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled
[51:30] it has to be for it is the spirit
[51:33] quickened word of God spoken by the
[51:36] prophet
[51:37] Malachi Jesus referred to it it's just
[51:41] before Christ comes the second
[51:43] time by the time Jesus comes all
[51:46] scripture must be
[51:47] fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will
[51:50] be in its last Church age when that
[51:52] messenger of Malachi comes he will be
[51:56] right with the word he will take the
[51:59] whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation
[52:01] he will start at the Serpent's Seed and
[52:03] carry on to the messenger in the latter
[52:05] Reign but he will be rejected by the
[52:11] denominations isn't it interesting that
[52:13] not one place he says now
[52:18] I I will be right with the
[52:21] word I will take the whole Bible from
[52:23] Genesis to Revelation I will start at
[52:26] the serpent seed and carry on to the
[52:29] messenger in the latter
[52:30] Reign but I will be rejected by
[52:33] denominations not one place he said that
[52:37] he said he will be because he wasn't
[52:39] looking to actually make himself that
[52:41] person what he was doing was pointing to
[52:43] the word saying that whether I am or
[52:45] whether I'm not there's going to be
[52:46] someone that will fulfill that word of
[52:48] God spoken by the prophet because it
[52:51] wasn't that Prophet it was God speaking
[52:53] through that human being it's just an
[52:55] amazing thing this is what captivated me
[52:57] with the message of the hour this man
[52:59] said it over and over again if you claim
[53:02] that I'm God's Prophet you say that I'm
[53:05] his Prophet just an amazing thing that
[53:08] that just captivated me paragraph 80 he
[53:11] has to be for that is the history
[53:12] repeating itself from the time from the
[53:15] time of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab
[53:19] is happening right here in America where
[53:22] the prophet of Malachi
[53:25] appears as Israel left Egypt to Worship
[53:29] in Freedom pushed out the natives raised
[53:32] up a nation with great leaders like
[53:35] David Etc and then put an Ahab on the
[53:38] throne with a jezebel behind him to
[53:41] direct so have we done the very same in
[53:46] America our forefathers left for this
[53:49] land to worship and live in Freedom they
[53:52] pushed back the natives and took over
[53:54] the land mighty men like Washington and
[53:57] Lincoln were raised up but after a while
[54:01] other men of such poor caliber succeeded
[54:05] these worthy men that soon an Ahab was
[54:09] set in the presidential chair with a
[54:11] jezebel behind him to direct him it is
[54:16] at such a time as this that the
[54:18] messenger of
[54:20] Malachi must come and you know looking
[54:24] at this here what what happens when when
[54:28] you push back all of the natives and all
[54:30] of the idolatry when you push back all
[54:33] of that that uh Pagan worship and and
[54:37] you create a place for the Living God to
[54:40] manifest and you Worship in Freedom and
[54:43] you set up a country and you have the
[54:45] freedom of religion and you worship the
[54:47] one true Living God but then you have
[54:50] that character come into the leadership
[54:53] set up in such a way that now all of the
[54:56] things that we once thought were good
[54:58] and and were we can change them to suit
[55:01] the lifestyles that we would like and
[55:04] what happens is we take God out of
[55:07] society and by pushing God out of
[55:09] society what you do is you create a
[55:11] vacuum for all of that Pagan worship to
[55:14] come right back into society again and
[55:16] that's exactly what he's talking about
[55:18] here they left for this land to worship
[55:22] and live in Freedom and and they pushed
[55:25] back the natives and took over the land
[55:26] mighty men like Washington and Lincoln
[55:28] were raised up but after a while other
[55:31] men of such poor caliber succeeded these
[55:33] worthy men and we know we we've read it
[55:35] already but this just was stimulating
[55:38] something in me uh and it's such a
[55:40] common word now or phrase cancel culture
[55:43] why do they want to do that because
[55:45] these Great Men set up a place where we
[55:47] could worship in freedom but what they
[55:50] do is turn around and say well what they
[55:52] they were involved in the slave trade so
[55:54] they're they're they're tainted men we
[55:56] need to cancel the culture a and we need
[55:59] to do away with that we need to forget
[56:00] about all of that if there is anything
[56:02] to do with any of that we need to shut
[56:04] it down and what happens is when you
[56:06] erase history you can pretty much
[56:08] predict the future because anything
[56:11] goes if you don't look at history you
[56:14] can't learn you can't correct from your
[56:17] mistakes but when you don't have a
[56:18] history to look at or you have uh maybe
[56:21] a fabled history then you can do
[56:23] whatever you want to do but this cancel
[56:25] culture just came to mind made me think
[56:27] about it what a terrible thing there's
[56:30] there's men that played a part and and
[56:33] some terrible men that played a part I
[56:36] don't dispute that for a second and
[56:38] isn't it wonderful that the prophet of
[56:40] God said that I think it was brother
[56:42] Bram said it that that man made slaves
[56:45] God never made slaves that is not the
[56:47] right thing that's a terrible
[56:50] thing never to be
[56:53] accepted but it wasn't just these men so
[56:57] anyways going on paragraph
[57:00] 82 then in the latter rain will come a
[57:04] Mount Carmel
[57:06] Showdown watch this carefully now to see
[57:08] it in the word John was the Forerunner
[57:12] of Malachi 3 he planted the former Reign
[57:15] and was rejected by the organizations of
[57:18] his day Jesus came and had a mount
[57:21] Transfiguration
[57:22] Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ
[57:26] will sow for the latter rain amen but
[57:29] this part here brothers and sisters is
[57:31] just for me uh it's just the hammer on
[57:34] the head it just hits it so hard Jesus
[57:37] will be the showdown between the
[57:40] denominations and Creeds for he will
[57:45] come he will come to back up his word
[57:48] and take up his prde in the Rapture amen
[57:51] hallelujah he's not even going to come
[57:53] and take on the Creeds and the dogmas
[57:55] and the ination he's not coming to fight
[57:57] that he's not coming to push back
[57:59] against all of that he's just going to
[58:00] come and vindicate his word and his
[58:02] bride and then take her home amen the
[58:05] first Showdown was Mount Carmel the
[58:07] second was Mount Transfiguration the
[58:10] third will be Mount
[58:13] Zion the strange behavior of Moses
[58:16] Elijah and John withdrawing from the
[58:18] people into seclusion left many confused
[58:21] they did not realize that it was because
[58:23] their messages had been rejected but the
[58:26] the seed had been sown the planting was
[58:29] over judgment was next they had served
[58:33] their purpose as a sign to the people so
[58:37] judgment was next and to think we've
[58:40] been alive in this generation to receive
[58:43] that word that was planted and now we
[58:46] see that word growing up it's not just
[58:49] in seed form anymore is
[58:52] it the next
[58:54] paragraph the next
[58:57] paragraph I I I just think it's really
[59:00] important to look at this just a little
[59:02] bit paragraph 84 I believe according to
[59:06] Revelations 13:16 that a bride will have
[59:09] to that the bride will have to stop
[59:12] preaching for the Beast is demanding the
[59:15] mark in the hand or the forehead if
[59:18] permission to preach be
[59:20] granted denominations will take the Mark
[59:23] or be forced to quit preaching then the
[59:26] lamb will come for his bride and judge
[59:29] the great
[59:32] Harlot we can read this and say that in
[59:35] the chronical chronological order that
[59:38] he has written this is the way that it's
[59:39] supposed to happen we have to be very
[59:42] careful because at the very beginning of
[59:44] this paragraph the first two words are I
[59:48] believe he doesn't say thus saith the
[59:51] Lord
[59:52] here in fact he preaches a sermon where
[59:55] he says that it's the secret sudden
[59:57] going away of the Bride he says the
[59:59] bride actually judges herself in the
[1:00:02] message of the hour not that she will be
[1:00:04] actually persecuted again there's some
[1:00:06] people that are pre-trib and post-trib
[1:00:08] and midrib the bride doesn't go through
[1:00:12] a
[1:00:12] tribulation she's not hunted down like a
[1:00:15] dog she is taken into the into the
[1:00:18] palace and she is set aside while Joseph
[1:00:22] reveals himself to his
[1:00:24] brethren I I don't want to say one way
[1:00:27] or the other but I do want to say this
[1:00:29] just like he said I predict in
[1:00:34] 1977 he didn't say thus sayith the Lord
[1:00:37] right he says I believe he doesn't say
[1:00:41] thus sayith the Lord it doesn't change
[1:00:44] the fact whether he's a prophet or not
[1:00:45] it's the word that he's speaking we have
[1:00:47] to be very careful on on how much we're
[1:00:50] going to put in one paragraph or even in
[1:00:52] one one sentence we have to be very
[1:00:55] careful about what he's saying when we
[1:00:58] take it an apply to our own
[1:01:00] lives now remember that Moses was born
[1:01:02] for a certain work but he could not do
[1:01:05] that work until he had received the
[1:01:07] gifts which would enable him to do the
[1:01:10] work he had to go out in the desert and
[1:01:12] wait
[1:01:14] there God had an appointed
[1:01:16] time there was to be a certain Pharaoh
[1:01:19] on the throne and the people had to be
[1:01:22] crying for the bread of life before God
[1:01:24] could send him back amen this is true
[1:01:27] for our
[1:01:29] day but what do we have in this our day
[1:01:34] multitudes are working signs until we
[1:01:36] have a great generation of sign Seekers
[1:01:40] I pray Lord help us not to be a
[1:01:42] generation of sign Seekers where if we
[1:01:45] don't have a prayer request go forwards
[1:01:48] and God doesn't answer it the way that
[1:01:49] we feel like it should be answered that
[1:01:52] we don't have it that's not it it's the
[1:01:55] word
[1:01:56] we have to have the word and all those
[1:01:58] signs and wonders will follow we got to
[1:02:01] put that word
[1:02:02] first I'll start over here he says but
[1:02:05] what do we have in this on our day
[1:02:06] multitudes are working signs until we
[1:02:08] have a great generation of have until we
[1:02:11] have a generation of sign Seekers that
[1:02:13] know little or nothing about the word or
[1:02:16] a true move of the spirit of God if they
[1:02:19] see blood oil and fire they are happy it
[1:02:23] matters not what is in the word
[1:02:26] they will support any sign even
[1:02:29] unscriptural ones and I want to say
[1:02:31] tonight brothers and sisters because
[1:02:32] someone speaks in
[1:02:33] tongues and interprets it or not it
[1:02:37] doesn't mean that the word is there
[1:02:40] we've got to be Uber careful ultra
[1:02:43] careful in the day in which we live
[1:02:45] because it'll be so close that it will
[1:02:46] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:02:49] possible the truly elected is going to
[1:02:51] say put the word of God first and if
[1:02:53] somebody's going to speak in tongues
[1:02:55] it's going to be in order it's going to
[1:02:57] be the way that the word of God says
[1:02:59] that it should be it's going to be the
[1:03:01] way that the prophet came and magnified
[1:03:03] the word of God says that it should be
[1:03:05] exactly what Paul preached that's what's
[1:03:07] going to happen and if it's any other
[1:03:10] thing it's not right don't be looking to
[1:03:14] speaking in tongues as a sign right and
[1:03:17] I'm saying that for a reason I can see
[1:03:19] it you you don't have to look very far
[1:03:22] and you can see there's a great push to
[1:03:24] see the the signs and wonders and and
[1:03:27] people are really anxious to try and
[1:03:29] support them it's great to have them but
[1:03:32] they're going to follow the word and if
[1:03:34] someone's not preaching the true word
[1:03:36] and the signs that are following are not
[1:03:38] going to be true
[1:03:41] signs but God has warned us about that
[1:03:44] he says he said in Matthew 24 that in
[1:03:46] the last days the two Spirits would be
[1:03:48] so close
[1:03:50] together that only the very elect could
[1:03:54] tell them apart
[1:03:57] for they alone would not be
[1:03:59] deceived so how close is it going to be
[1:04:01] brothers and sisters it's going to be
[1:04:04] right in in the very Church in which we
[1:04:06] go to we're going to see things and
[1:04:08] we're going to have to go like this but
[1:04:11] that doesn't change the word of God and
[1:04:13] it shouldn't change our heart it should
[1:04:16] give us a heart to have compassion and
[1:04:18] love for our brothers and
[1:04:20] sisters because brother Ram said it
[1:04:23] there's an order for everything and uh
[1:04:25] we'll get into that at a later date but
[1:04:27] I just think this is so important for us
[1:04:29] to
[1:04:30] remember we need to know exactly where
[1:04:32] we
[1:04:33] stand how can you tell the spirits apart
[1:04:36] he says just give them the word test
[1:04:40] amen just give them the word test are
[1:04:44] those Spirits saying yay and amen to the
[1:04:47] word or do they have some sort of a a
[1:04:50] navigation around it some sort of a
[1:04:52] detour some sort of a shortcut some sort
[1:04:54] of a something remember one word off and
[1:04:57] I just can't help but think about
[1:04:59] Hebrews chapter 1 you know we talked
[1:05:01] about it last time I saw that Minister
[1:05:03] saying it you know in sunry times and
[1:05:05] diverse manners God spake to the
[1:05:08] fathers and the guy stopped but how did
[1:05:12] he speak to him he spoke to him through
[1:05:13] the prophets but if you take the
[1:05:14] prophets out then you can just create
[1:05:16] whatever kind of you want it just goes
[1:05:18] right into the denominationalism the the
[1:05:20] theological study I've got the
[1:05:22] certificate I know the Bible I have a
[1:05:24] Theology and uh
[1:05:26] that's not it at all but how can you
[1:05:28] tell the spirits apart I love how the
[1:05:31] the word in the prophet gives us the
[1:05:34] question the great question how can you
[1:05:35] tell those Spirits apart if they're
[1:05:36] going to be so close that they would
[1:05:38] deceive their very elect just give them
[1:05:40] the word test if they don't speak that
[1:05:42] word they are of the evil
[1:05:46] one as the evil one deceived the first
[1:05:49] two
[1:05:50] Brides I love this he will try to
[1:05:53] deceive the Bride of this last days but
[1:05:55] by trying to get her to hybridize
[1:05:58] herself through Creeds or just plainly
[1:06:02] turning from the word to any sign that
[1:06:06] suits
[1:06:07] her say bless God I had this happen
[1:06:10] bless God we had that happen bless God
[1:06:12] the other happened but yet not live a
[1:06:15] life that's consecrated to the word
[1:06:17] there's something wrong it's not the
[1:06:19] word
[1:06:29] but God never placed signs ahead of the
[1:06:32] word signs follow the word as when
[1:06:35] Elijah told the woman bake a cake for
[1:06:38] him first remember that woman that Great
[1:06:42] Famine that was in the land amen she
[1:06:44] came out with two sticks to make a cross
[1:06:47] with that there would be a a cross
[1:06:50] between the old Covenant and the New
[1:06:52] Covenant there would be something that
[1:06:54] would actually make a way for life in
[1:06:57] the midst of death she and her son were
[1:07:00] dying of starvation she came out and
[1:07:02] said we're just about to die all I've
[1:07:05] got are these two sticks put to get to
[1:07:06] put together and and one maybe one
[1:07:09] morsel of of meal and that's it and
[1:07:11] we're going to die there's nothing
[1:07:13] left and and and how could she have that
[1:07:16] Revelation where the Prophet would say
[1:07:18] to her bake me a cake go go make me a
[1:07:20] cake how many of the sisters in here
[1:07:22] would do that when your children are
[1:07:24] starving in the midst of a famine how
[1:07:26] many people in here would do that for
[1:07:28] our children when when we're going
[1:07:30] through that kind of a situation I would
[1:07:32] say the very elected would if they've
[1:07:34] got that Revelation because they know
[1:07:36] that's a prophet of God that stands
[1:07:37] before them and if he says give bake me
[1:07:40] a cake what's going to
[1:07:42] happen the beautiful thing is it's not
[1:07:44] even just a prophet standing before her
[1:07:46] she knew that was God she knew that was
[1:07:49] God in flesh now I'm not saying that was
[1:07:53] Jesus but that was God the spirit of God
[1:07:56] was upon that man and she knew it she
[1:08:00] knew
[1:08:01] it as when Elijah told the woman to bake
[1:08:03] a cake for him first according to the
[1:08:05] word of the Lord when she did as the the
[1:08:10] what I thought the prophet said oh the
[1:08:12] word said when she did as the word said
[1:08:17] the proper sign
[1:08:21] came come to the word first and then
[1:08:24] watch the
[1:08:27] Miracle it's interesting how he's
[1:08:29] written this this is still thus sayith
[1:08:32] the Lord in pick up your pen and
[1:08:34] write it was the word when she did as
[1:08:38] the word said even though it was the
[1:08:40] prophet standing before her talking when
[1:08:42] she did as the word said the proper sign
[1:08:44] came come to the word first and watch
[1:08:46] the miracle the seed word is energized
[1:08:50] by the spirit How can any messenger sent
[1:08:53] from God believe only a part of of the
[1:08:55] word and deny some of
[1:08:58] it you just have to say
[1:09:01] right like the true prophet of God in
[1:09:05] this last day will proclaim the whole
[1:09:06] word denominations will hate him yes his
[1:09:09] words may be as harsh as John the
[1:09:12] Baptist who called them
[1:09:14] vipers but the predestinated will hear
[1:09:17] and be ready for the Rapture but you
[1:09:20] take and and you look at it there's many
[1:09:22] people that will take predestination out
[1:09:23] of it they'll say we then you don't have
[1:09:25] a Choice you're not a free moral agent
[1:09:27] but we know isn't it wonderful how how
[1:09:28] brother brandham brought that out made
[1:09:30] that clear how God made that clear
[1:09:32] through the prophet no you are a free
[1:09:33] moral agency and God knows what the
[1:09:35] outcome is and and he will see his word
[1:09:38] come to pass just look at the prophet
[1:09:40] Micaiah and see that whole story and see
[1:09:43] if he won't make it come to pass he he
[1:09:45] will help us make the decision we'll
[1:09:47] make the right decision the
[1:09:49] circumstances will be such that we will
[1:09:52] make the right decision but we will make
[1:09:55] the decision it will be us amen the
[1:09:59] Royal Seed of Abraham with the faith of
[1:10:03] Abraham's will hold to the word with him
[1:10:07] for they are predestinated together the
[1:10:10] last day Messenger will appear in God's
[1:10:12] appointed time it is it is the end time
[1:10:16] now as we all know for Israel is in the
[1:10:19] Homeland any time now he will come
[1:10:22] according to Malachi when we see him he
[1:10:25] will be dedicated to the
[1:10:27] word he will be indicated pointed out in
[1:10:32] the word Revelations
[1:10:36] 107 and God will vindicate his
[1:10:40] ministry he will preach the truth as did
[1:10:43] Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion
[1:10:48] Showdown I just think that's so good we
[1:10:53] uh I just want to make sure I I read
[1:10:55] this again brothers and sisters it it's
[1:10:58] so
[1:11:05] good it's just back in paragraph 82
[1:11:10] here then in the latter rain will come
[1:11:12] Mount carel Showdown watch this
[1:11:14] carefully now to see it in the word John
[1:11:16] was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he
[1:11:18] planted the former rain and was rejected
[1:11:21] by the organizations of his day Jesus
[1:11:23] came and had a mount Transfiguration
[1:11:26] Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ
[1:11:29] will sow for the latter Reign
[1:11:32] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:11:35] denominations and Creeds for he will
[1:11:37] come to back up his word and take up his
[1:11:39] bride in the Rapture first Showdown was
[1:11:42] Mount Carmel second was the mount
[1:11:44] Transfiguration the third will be Mount
[1:11:48] Zion but at the beginning of this last
[1:11:50] paragraph he says Jesus Will Be The
[1:11:54] Showdown Jes Jesus will be the showdown
[1:11:56] between the denominations we're going to
[1:11:58] get into it a little bit further here as
[1:12:01] we
[1:12:02] go uh many will misunderstand him
[1:12:05] because they have been taught scripture
[1:12:06] in a certain way which they consider
[1:12:09] truth when he comes against that they
[1:12:13] will not believe even some true
[1:12:16] ministers will misunderstand the
[1:12:19] messenger because so much has been
[1:12:21] called God's truth by deceivers
[1:12:26] but this Prophet will come and as the
[1:12:28] Forerunner to the first coming cried
[1:12:29] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[1:12:32] the sin of the world even so will he no
[1:12:35] doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God
[1:12:39] coming in glory he will do this for even
[1:12:43] as John was the messenger of Truth to
[1:12:45] the the elect so is this one the last
[1:12:50] Messenger to the elect and word born
[1:12:53] bride I I just think it's so amazing
[1:12:56] brothers and sisters it just makes me
[1:12:57] think about the king's sword when when
[1:13:01] reading this paragraph Jesus will be the
[1:13:03] showdown between the denominations and
[1:13:06] the
[1:13:07] Creeds you think about that story about
[1:13:09] brother bradam praying and that sword
[1:13:12] hits his hand what is that sword hitting
[1:13:15] his hand it's not just some some
[1:13:17] storybook design that we would teach our
[1:13:20] children that once upon a time there was
[1:13:22] a man that was praying up in in sainia
[1:13:24] Canyon up in the mountains and and
[1:13:26] suddenly there was a sword and it was
[1:13:28] said it was the sword of the king that's
[1:13:30] that word that we're talking about Jesus
[1:13:33] Christ coming back to man you know we we
[1:13:36] I just want to preach now we are talking
[1:13:38] about it before service you know this
[1:13:39] whole AI thing sorry brother I just have
[1:13:42] to I don't know it's just happening this
[1:13:45] AI thing brothers and sisters is a
[1:13:46] direct link back to the tree of
[1:13:48] knowledge of Good and Evil and isn't
[1:13:50] that interesting because everything that
[1:13:52] Satan does is a perversion of what God's
[1:13:53] done has God not come himself and
[1:13:56] actually given us the direct link back
[1:13:58] to the Tree of Life Hallelujah why
[1:14:01] wouldn't Satan do that why wouldn't he
[1:14:03] come and try and pervert it now and make
[1:14:05] it look like it's this wonderful thing
[1:14:07] we've got all this knowledge we can do
[1:14:08] everything that we want to one of these
[1:14:10] days I'm going to actually take a look
[1:14:11] at it I've never really looked at it
[1:14:13] I've just heard Lots about it it's just
[1:14:15] an interesting thing I find Satan can
[1:14:18] only pervert he cannot create and this
[1:14:21] word this sword that was placed in the
[1:14:23] hand of man again is what's going to do
[1:14:25] the dividing that's what's going to give
[1:14:28] us the ability to overcome it
[1:14:30] all then all the signs and wonders will
[1:14:33] follow Christ eulogizes the church out
[1:14:36] of Revelations 2:13 he says I Know Thy
[1:14:39] works and where thou dwellest even where
[1:14:41] Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my
[1:14:44] name and Hast not denied my faith even
[1:14:47] in those days where in antipast was my
[1:14:50] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[1:14:53] where Satan dwelleth
[1:14:56] he says I Know Thy works these are the
[1:14:58] identical words uttered to each of the
[1:15:01] seven Messengers relative to the people
[1:15:03] of God in each age as they are spoken to
[1:15:07] the two Vines true and false spoken to
[1:15:11] the True Vine to the both Vines hey the
[1:15:13] true and the false they will bring joy
[1:15:15] and gladness to the hearts of one
[1:15:18] group but they ought to strike Terror in
[1:15:21] the hearts of the other for though we
[1:15:24] are saved by Grace apart from Works true
[1:15:27] salvation will bring forth works or
[1:15:30] deeds that will please God in 1 John 3:7
[1:15:35] little children let no man deceive you
[1:15:38] he that doeth worketh righteousness is
[1:15:43] righteous even as he is
[1:15:47] righteous now I just have this next
[1:15:50] sentence highlighted it's just so
[1:15:51] beautiful and and he just backs it up
[1:15:53] with verse after verse after verse if
[1:15:56] this verse means anything at all it
[1:15:58] means that what a man does he
[1:16:02] is little children let no man deceive
[1:16:05] you he that doeth worketh righteousness
[1:16:08] is righteous even as he is
[1:16:12] righteous got to put the word
[1:16:15] first James 3:11 do a fountain sent
[1:16:19] forth at the same place Sweet Water and
[1:16:22] bitter no do we have have dual
[1:16:26] personalities no we have Christ
[1:16:29] personality amen Romans 6:2 how shall we
[1:16:34] that are dead in sin dead to sin live
[1:16:37] any longer therein how can we continue
[1:16:40] in the old way it doesn't work Matthew
[1:16:43] 1233 to35 either make the tree good and
[1:16:48] his fruit good or else make the tree
[1:16:51] corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the
[1:16:54] tree is known by his fruit and isn't
[1:16:57] that exactly what Jesus did he
[1:17:00] manifested it before his disciples and
[1:17:02] they marveled at it he went to the fig
[1:17:05] tree saw it wasn't right it wasn't there
[1:17:07] when the King of Kings walked by that
[1:17:10] tree he should have had fruit hanging on
[1:17:12] it but Jesus said hey your time has come
[1:17:15] and now you're going to wither up
[1:17:17] exactly according to this scripture here
[1:17:19] he goes on to say oh Generation of
[1:17:21] Vipers how can ye bring being evil speak
[1:17:24] good things
[1:17:25] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:17:28] the mouth speaketh a good man of the
[1:17:31] good Treasure of the heart bringeth
[1:17:33] forth good things an evil man out of the
[1:17:36] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[1:17:41] my goodness he's not talking about
[1:17:43] opening up a treasure box and showing
[1:17:45] evil treasure he's talking about what
[1:17:47] we're speaking with our
[1:17:52] mouths 1 Peter 1:23
[1:17:55] brother bam he says this first though
[1:17:57] now if a man is born of the word he will
[1:18:00] produce the word 1 Peter 1:23 being born
[1:18:05] again not of corruptible seed but of
[1:18:07] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:18:09] liveth and abideth
[1:18:12] forever the fruit or works of his life
[1:18:15] will be a product of the kind of seed or
[1:18:19] life that is in him now I think it's
[1:18:23] real important to say this
[1:18:25] sometimes we can be a son or a daughter
[1:18:27] of God and we can have the wrong fruit
[1:18:29] being manifest on our branches we can
[1:18:32] have the wrong life being lived before
[1:18:34] others but that doesn't mean that we are
[1:18:37] not a son and daughter of
[1:18:39] God it's not up to us to determine that
[1:18:42] it's up to God to determine that it's up
[1:18:44] to us to water that tree to give
[1:18:47] encouragement to that tree to give the
[1:18:50] The Gift of Life to that tree to to
[1:18:52] speak good things about that tree
[1:18:56] many times we can look at the fruit and
[1:18:57] sayoo it's terrible that's terrible
[1:18:59] fruit it can never turn out right God is
[1:19:03] the master of those situations amen and
[1:19:06] if we have any question we don't have to
[1:19:07] look too far just take a look at Saul or
[1:19:10] or
[1:19:12] Paul Paul in the Bible he had a terrible
[1:19:17] life and everyone would have looked at
[1:19:19] him and said that guy there's no way
[1:19:21] that he would ever have anything to do
[1:19:22] with the Church of the Living God but
[1:19:24] but yet what was he he was the first
[1:19:27] church age Master he was the pattern for
[1:19:29] the
[1:19:30] church
[1:19:32] wow the fruit of the works of his life
[1:19:34] will be a product of the kind of seed or
[1:19:37] life that's in him that seed can come to
[1:19:39] life it can actually be birthed into a
[1:19:42] new
[1:19:43] birth his Works therefore will be
[1:19:46] scriptural oh what an indictment this
[1:19:49] truth is going to be against the pergami
[1:19:51] and age there stands that matchless one
[1:19:55] and his hand in his hand the sharp sword
[1:19:58] with the two edges the word of God when
[1:20:01] I was studying this I just had this
[1:20:03] Vision that that there he stands with
[1:20:05] the sharp sword in his hand not even
[1:20:08] speaking a word but being the word and
[1:20:11] in the midst of all of the evil that
[1:20:13] word that sword in his hand a little bit
[1:20:16] this way a little bit this way
[1:20:18] everything is destroyed everything is
[1:20:20] proven by that sword he doesn't have to
[1:20:22] speak a word there he stands with that
[1:20:24] sword SW drawn the word Discerning
[1:20:28] everyone my the sword with two edges the
[1:20:32] word of God and that word will judge us
[1:20:35] in the last day in fact the word is
[1:20:38] judging even
[1:20:40] now for it is a discerner of the
[1:20:43] thoughts and the intents of the
[1:20:46] heart I say Lord just just discern my
[1:20:50] thoughts and and and the intents of my
[1:20:52] heart it cuts a under the carnal from
[1:20:55] the spiritual and it makes us living
[1:20:58] Epistles read and known of all men to
[1:21:00] the glory of God I Know Thy works if a
[1:21:04] man fears that he might not please God
[1:21:07] this is really good I'm going to pause
[1:21:09] here and just say this is really good
[1:21:10] this is really good let's just focus on
[1:21:13] this for a little bit shall we I Know
[1:21:15] Thy works if a man fears that he might
[1:21:17] not please God then let him fulfill the
[1:21:21] word if a man wonders if he will hear
[1:21:24] those words well done good and faithful
[1:21:27] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[1:21:31] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:21:36] those words of Praise Hallelujah do you
[1:21:39] ever wonder that do you ever wonder if
[1:21:43] if you ever have that fear in your life
[1:21:44] that you might not please God all you
[1:21:47] got to do is follow his
[1:21:49] word and don't worry about the big
[1:21:52] Supernatural things don't worry about
[1:21:55] the great service that we can bring to
[1:21:57] the kingdom of God just do the
[1:22:00] ABCs and if you wonder what they are see
[1:22:03] what the prophet had said just read
[1:22:05] conduct order and Doctrine look at
[1:22:07] church order look at those little tiny
[1:22:09] ABC Elementary things in the message of
[1:22:12] the hour and see does our life line up
[1:22:14] with that because if it doesn't then we
[1:22:18] maybe will have a little bit of fear
[1:22:19] will we please God if you want to please
[1:22:21] God follow the word of the prophet
[1:22:24] that's what we heard that woman came out
[1:22:27] and followed the word and what happened
[1:22:30] she had her life
[1:22:33] restored I think this is just so
[1:22:35] beautiful this gets me excited I think
[1:22:37] it's so beautiful you don't we don't
[1:22:38] have to fear I guess is really I'm where
[1:22:40] I'm going with this where I said I
[1:22:41] wanted to dwell on it brothers and
[1:22:42] sisters we don't have to fear alls we
[1:22:44] need to do is just fulfill the word and
[1:22:47] how do we fulfill the word just follow
[1:22:49] the word put the word out front hold
[1:22:52] that word before our families hold that
[1:22:54] that word before our wives hold that
[1:22:56] word before our children hold that word
[1:22:58] before
[1:22:59] ourselves let him fulfill the word of
[1:23:02] God at his life and assuredly he will
[1:23:04] hear those words of praise the word of
[1:23:07] Truth was the Criterion then at is the
[1:23:11] Criterion now there isn't another
[1:23:14] standard and isn't it interesting how
[1:23:16] the world has tried to make another
[1:23:18] standard we've got this Doctrine we've
[1:23:20] got that Doctrine we've got the other
[1:23:21] Doctrine you just take that pure word
[1:23:23] out
[1:23:25] and see what happens it becomes a freef
[1:23:27] fall without a parachute terminal
[1:23:29] velocity is next and then impact right
[1:23:33] the word of Truth was the Criterion then
[1:23:35] it's the Criterion now there isn't
[1:23:37] another standard there isn't another
[1:23:39] Plum line as the world is going to be
[1:23:43] judged by one Jesus Christ not two not
[1:23:48] three even so it is going to be judged
[1:23:52] by the word if a a man wants to know how
[1:23:55] he's making out then let him do as James
[1:23:58] suggested suggested look into the mirror
[1:24:01] of God's
[1:24:02] word he makes it so clear and so easy
[1:24:07] here it's just
[1:24:09] amazing I didn't even say where it ended
[1:24:12] I put so much emphasis on it I just want
[1:24:14] to mention this here where where pick up
[1:24:17] your pen and write ends in the
[1:24:19] exposition of the seven Church ages is
[1:24:21] right where he eulogizes the church
[1:24:24] Christ eulogizes the church and we know
[1:24:26] what a eulogy is that's read at a
[1:24:28] funeral that's where someone's died and
[1:24:31] you know there is going to be a death
[1:24:32] there has to be a death in order for
[1:24:35] there to be a new birth there has to be
[1:24:36] a death and with outside of the new
[1:24:39] birth outside of the death to ourselves
[1:24:41] a and a new birth happening in our lives
[1:24:44] the only thing we've got is the eulogy
[1:24:46] that Christ will read about us that we
[1:24:47] just didn't follow his word we tried to
[1:24:51] put some sort of works or some sort of
[1:24:53] other thing
[1:24:54] ahead of it and the only thing that
[1:24:56] we've got is death at that point and
[1:24:58] that's to be eternally separated from
[1:25:02] God paragraph 97 I Know Thy
[1:25:06] Works wow I Know Thy works as he stood
[1:25:10] there with the word examining their
[1:25:13] lives in the light of the blueprint he
[1:25:15] had laid out for them he must have been
[1:25:18] pleased in goodly measure for they like
[1:25:21] others who had gone on before were
[1:25:23] enduring ing the persecution of the
[1:25:25] unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto
[1:25:28] the Lord difficult though it was at
[1:25:31] times to serve the Lord yet they served
[1:25:35] him and worshiped him in spirit and in
[1:25:39] truth but with the false Vine it was not
[1:25:42] so alas they had repudiated the life
[1:25:47] that was that is built upon the word and
[1:25:51] we're now going further and further away
[1:25:53] from the
[1:25:54] truth their actions bore witness to the
[1:25:58] depths to which they had
[1:26:02] sunk thou holdest fast my name John 668
[1:26:06] to whom can we go thou alone Hast the
[1:26:09] words of eternal
[1:26:11] life they held fast then they were
[1:26:14] holding fast now but not with fatalistic
[1:26:18] dread as men who live out Barren lives
[1:26:21] they were holding fast in his Str stren
[1:26:25] in the insurance of the spirit that they
[1:26:28] were one in him I just want to encourage
[1:26:32] us tonight brothers and sisters it's
[1:26:34] going to be hard to serve the Lord we
[1:26:36] know that but just hold fast just hold
[1:26:40] fast and and have the Assurance of the
[1:26:44] spirit that you are one in him theirs
[1:26:47] was the sure knowledge of sins
[1:26:49] forgiven and they bore the name of
[1:26:52] Christian in testimony to it they knew
[1:26:57] and loved that name that was above every
[1:27:00] name their knees had bowed to that name
[1:27:02] their tongues had confessed to it
[1:27:04] whatsoever they did they did it all in
[1:27:07] the name of the Lord Jesus they had
[1:27:11] named that name and departed from Evil
[1:27:15] and having taken their stand they were
[1:27:18] now prepared to die for that name being
[1:27:23] assured of a better
[1:27:25] Resurrection now this can be taken
[1:27:27] really really sort of surface level and
[1:27:30] lightly but it's very
[1:27:32] important and and I can say for me in my
[1:27:34] Christian walk this was basically the
[1:27:36] Crux for me to understand the unlocking
[1:27:39] of the power of the spirit of God and in
[1:27:42] just in my life just in in my ability to
[1:27:44] overcome to recognize the name of Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:50] is where all the power is all of it take
[1:27:53] the name of Jesus with you he says child
[1:27:55] of sorrow and of wo we know this is a
[1:27:57] song it will joy and comfort give you
[1:28:00] take it then where a you go precious
[1:28:05] name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy
[1:28:09] Of
[1:28:10] Heaven he says already in the second
[1:28:13] century those words Father Son and Holy
[1:28:17] Ghost had spelled out Trinity to
[1:28:22] many and the polytheistic idea of three
[1:28:27] Gods had become a Doctrine in the false
[1:28:32] church I was thinking this is pretty
[1:28:35] strong it became a Doctrine in the false
[1:28:39] church and you know it's not in the in
[1:28:42] the I don't even know what you call it
[1:28:45] the satanic Church the Church of Satan
[1:28:47] that's not we're talking about that's
[1:28:48] not what he's talking about he's talking
[1:28:50] about the church that is so close to the
[1:28:52] real Church the The Vines are so close
[1:28:55] he's talking about it in a way that this
[1:28:57] is the majority of the churches have
[1:29:00] taken it this
[1:29:01] way already in the second century those
[1:29:04] words Father Son and Holy Ghost had
[1:29:05] spelled out Trinity to many and the
[1:29:07] polytheistic idea of three Gods had
[1:29:09] become a Doctrine in the false Church it
[1:29:12] would not be long until the name was
[1:29:15] taken away that's great as indeed it was
[1:29:19] in this age and in instead the titles of
[1:29:24] the one great God would be substituted
[1:29:27] for the name Lord Jesus Christ while the
[1:29:31] many apostasis and embraced a trinity
[1:29:36] and baptized using titles of godhead is
[1:29:40] beautiful the little flock still
[1:29:41] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ and so held to the truth amen
[1:29:47] with so many dishonoring God turning him
[1:29:50] into three gods and changing his
[1:29:53] gracious name to titles one would wonder
[1:29:57] if the signs and wonders that attended
[1:29:59] to such great name would still be
[1:30:03] visited amongst the people indeed those
[1:30:06] signs would still be would indeed those
[1:30:10] signs were mightily and wonderfully
[1:30:14] manifested though certainly not in the
[1:30:16] false fine men like Martin were greatly
[1:30:19] used of God and bore them witness both
[1:30:22] by signs and wonders gifts of the Holy
[1:30:25] Ghost that name was still effectual as
[1:30:29] it always has been and ever will be
[1:30:32] where the Saints honor him through the
[1:30:35] word and Faith I'll call the musicians
[1:30:39] up as we read the last paragraph here I
[1:30:42] really would like to keep
[1:30:46] going thou Hast not denied my faith in
[1:30:50] Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the
[1:30:54] mighty Miracle had taken place upon the
[1:31:00] at the gate beautiful he
[1:31:02] explained it on this wise and his Jesus
[1:31:07] name through faith in his jesus' name
[1:31:12] had made this man former strong
[1:31:15] yay the faith which is by from him Jesus
[1:31:21] hath given him the man
[1:31:24] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:31:26] of you all see there it is it can sound
[1:31:30] really confusing the way he has it
[1:31:32] written there but he says see there it
[1:31:35] is jesus' name and jesus' Faith brought
[1:31:39] about the
[1:31:41] miracle Peter did not claim it was his
[1:31:44] own human Faith anymore than he claimed
[1:31:47] that it was it was his own name he said
[1:31:52] that jesus' name was used in the faith
[1:31:55] which is from Jesus performed that great
[1:31:59] work this faith is what the Lord was
[1:32:03] speaking about in Revelations
[1:32:06] 2:13 it was his faith amen it was faith
[1:32:13] in
[1:32:14] him but it was his own faith that he had
[1:32:18] given to the Believers Hallelujah and
[1:32:21] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:22] forever maybe stand with me as close
[1:32:25] tonight brother Bram goes into it I'm
[1:32:27] not going to go further with it we'll
[1:32:30] pick it up later but it's all about
[1:32:34] having his faith brothers and sisters
[1:32:36] recognizing that it's is no longer our
[1:32:39] faith and there needs to come a place I
[1:32:41] just had this scripture it came to mind
[1:32:43] when I was reading this studying here in
[1:32:45] 1 Peter
[1:32:47] 1:8 whom he have not seen ye love in
[1:32:52] whom though now ye see him not not yet
[1:32:54] believing ye Rejoice with joy
[1:32:58] unspeakable and full of
[1:33:00] Glory verse 9 says receiving the end of
[1:33:04] your faith even the salvation of your
[1:33:07] souls of which salvation the prophets
[1:33:10] have inquired and searched diligently
[1:33:13] who prophesied of the grace that should
[1:33:15] come unto you to think about this here
[1:33:18] there's a place where it's the end of
[1:33:20] our faith where our human faith comes to
[1:33:23] the end and I believe it's on this side
[1:33:25] of Jordan and when we step over that
[1:33:28] that Jordan River and we take that
[1:33:31] spiritual death in our life we actually
[1:33:33] step into a brand new faith and that's
[1:33:36] where we get that Caleb and Joshua kind
[1:33:38] of Faith that's where we have a
[1:33:40] different level of living in our
[1:33:43] lives boy I feel like I could preach now
[1:33:46] my goodness let's just bow in prayer
[1:33:49] amen gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[1:33:51] you Lord for your word thank you Lord
