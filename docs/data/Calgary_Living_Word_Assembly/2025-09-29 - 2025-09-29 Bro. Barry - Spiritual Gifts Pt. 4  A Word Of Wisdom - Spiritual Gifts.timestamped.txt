[30:23] &gt;&gt; Handed down through the ages.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. As I was walking up to the pulpit
[30:27] tonight, I just thought, my, we are the
[30:30] recipients of that word.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; To think that we are those people, not
[30:35] because we chose it, [music] because he
[30:37] did.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[30:41] make it known unto him by way of an
[30:44] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[30:46] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, one more
[30:48] time we come to you, Father, with all of
[30:51] our needs, with all of our burdens,
[30:54] Lord, with all of our cares and all of
[30:58] our troubles.
[31:00] Father, there's nowhere else in this
[31:02] world that we would rather go.
[31:04] And Father, we are so thankful that you
[31:07] have your ears open [music] every single
[31:09] time we pray, Lord.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to bring
[31:14] the needs before your throne, Lord. We
[31:16] once again thank you for releasing,
[31:19] Lord, the hostages, Lord Jesus.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; For restoring the brothers back to their
[31:25] families, Lord,
[31:27] &gt;&gt; for restoring the families back to the
[31:29] congregation, Lord [music] Jesus.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; You are a mighty God. Oh, hallelujah.
[31:35] There's no one like you, Father.
[31:39] Lord Jesus, tonight we thank you for
[31:41] watching over the Kikuji [music] family,
[31:43] Lord, at the passing of their mama,
[31:45] Sister Charmaine.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just want to remember
[31:49] brother Dodie and his family and brother
[31:52] Mila and his family and brother Martin,
[31:54] Lord, and Sister Adijah, [music] Father.
[31:57] We just hold them before your throne
[31:58] tonight, Lord.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for working
[32:03] all things to our good, Father. All
[32:06] things work together for the good to
[32:08] those who are called according to your
[32:10] purpose, Lord. And I know that's the
[32:12] very words of Brother Dodie. And we
[32:14] thank you for that, Lord.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to remember
[32:18] Sister Mary Carpenter. She needs a touch
[32:20] from you, Lord. And Father, every single
[32:23] need that was made known unto you
[32:24] tonight by the way of an uplift hand,
[32:26] Father, we pray that you would just
[32:28] sovereignly meet the needs once again.
[32:31] Father, we're thankful that we can
[32:32] gather together in your name here. One
[32:35] more time, we just invite you to have
[32:37] the preeminence, Lord, in all that's
[32:39] said and done.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Just ask all [music] these things now in
[32:43] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[32:51] Once again, if you have your Bibles, I
[32:54] would like to continue on with our
[32:55] discussion on gifts
[32:58] in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[33:03] Certainly like to welcome brother Harvey
[33:05] back. He's been a world traveler.
[33:08] He's gone to where the penguins live.
[33:13] Certainly welcome our friends, Brother
[33:15] Larry and Sister Karen as well.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Always wonderful to see you and each one
[33:21] tonight.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; It's amazing when you come into a a
[33:25] fairly full building on a Wednesday
[33:27] night. That means something.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; So God bless you tonight.
[33:31] 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one says,
[33:35] "Now concerning spiritual gifts,
[33:36] brethren, I would not have you
[33:38] ignorant." Thank you, Lord.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; We know that ye were Gentiles carried
[33:44] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[33:48] were led.
[33:49] Wherefore I give you to understand
[33:52] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[33:54] God calleth Jesus a cursed
[33:58] and that no man can say that Jesus is
[34:01] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but
[34:08] the same spirit. And there are
[34:10] differences of administrations
[34:13] but the same Lord.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; And there are diversities of
[34:18] operations but it is the same God which
[34:22] workketh all in all. But the
[34:24] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[34:27] every man to profit with all. For to one
[34:31] is given the spirit sorry one is given
[34:35] by the spirit the word of wisdom to
[34:38] another the word of knowledge by the
[34:41] same spirit to another faith by the same
[34:45] spirit to another
[34:48] the gifts of healing by the same spirit
[34:51] to another the working of miracles to
[34:54] another prophecy to another discerning
[34:58] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[35:01] tongues and to another the
[35:04] interpretation of tongues.
[35:06] But all these workketh that one in the
[35:11] selfsame spirit dividing to every man
[35:15] severally as he will.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. For as the body is one and hath
[35:21] many members, and all the members of
[35:24] that one body being many
[35:27] are one body, so also is Christ.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit, we are all baptized
[35:35] into one body, whether we be Jews or
[35:39] Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
[35:42] and have been all made to drink into one
[35:45] spirit.
[35:47] For the body is not one member but many.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[35:56] we can be counted a part of your body.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would
[36:01] impart the words that are spoken
[36:03] tonight, Father, to our souls.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; That when we leave here tonight, we
[36:06] would say that truly
[36:09] our hearts burn within us, Father, as we
[36:11] walk with you along the way.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus
[36:16] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[36:19] seated.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful, wonderful communion
[36:25] service on Sunday. Boy, it was just a
[36:28] wonderful day.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Just want to uh remind everyone we have
[36:31] the youth service coming up on Friday
[36:34] here at 7:30.
[36:36] We're going to just have a regular
[36:38] service and uh see what the Lord will
[36:40] do. So, if you want to come out, you're
[36:43] certainly welcome to do so.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be at 7:30 and it's going to
[36:46] be uh completely run by the youth. It'll
[36:50] be youth musicians. It'll be uh minister
[36:53] by the youth and then some more youth
[36:55] songs after. And uh yeah, we're
[36:58] certainly excited about that. We'll have
[37:00] a little bit of fellowship after
[37:01] service, I'm sure. So, that will be on
[37:04] Friday night. And we have uh brother
[37:06] Cadre Digs here on the 22nd and 23rd of
[37:08] November. We have the 2025 graduation
[37:13] celebration will be taking place in uh
[37:16] June, I believe it is. Yeah, we have a
[37:18] date June 27th, 2026.
[37:22] It'll be at 6 PM at the Glenmore Inn.
[37:25] And so we would like to just uh we'll
[37:28] send something out about it, but I just
[37:30] wanted to mention it. Um there will be a
[37:33] few people who have graduated already
[37:35] that didn't really celebrate with the
[37:37] body and we want to make sure that we
[37:39] offer that opportunity. So if you would
[37:42] like to uh celebrate your graduation
[37:44] whether it's a post-secary or um
[37:49] a grade 12 grad, we certainly want to
[37:51] celebrate that with you. So we will uh
[37:54] send out more details as they come and
[37:58] uh we'll certainly keep you posted. Are
[38:00] you happy tonight?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Has the devil been going about as a
[38:04] roaring lion since our testimony service
[38:06] on Sunday?
[38:08] &gt;&gt; I know he's been coming after me. And I
[38:11] think it's a good thing because that
[38:13] means I'm on the right side.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not friends with the devil.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; But uh it hasn't been easy. It's amazing
[38:21] to see, you know, uh we can find
[38:23] ourselves in circumstances and
[38:25] situations and wonder why is it like
[38:27] this? And then remember, you know, we
[38:29] had just had a wonderful time with the
[38:31] Lord. The devil's not going to let us
[38:33] stay there. Not for a second,
[38:36] &gt;&gt; but he can't help it. He's not going to
[38:38] be able to stop us.
[38:41] Getting into our scripture tonight out
[38:43] of 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Um, we've
[38:47] talked about it. Uh, this is part four
[38:49] of our discussion on the gifts. And I
[38:52] wanted to start to talk about the actual
[38:54] uh named gifts that are in here from
[38:57] verse 8. Um but verse 7 says, "The
[39:00] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[39:02] every man to profit with all." So it's
[39:04] not exclusive to any man. And we know
[39:06] that the word also says that the
[39:08] scripture, the word of God, is of no
[39:11] private interpretation. So, as soon as
[39:14] we have someone saying that they've got
[39:15] an edge on some sort of a revelation in
[39:18] the word of God, does it line up with
[39:20] the word of God first of all? And if it
[39:22] does, then that's good. And then, does
[39:24] it line up with the seventh angel
[39:26] messengers word? And if it doesn't, then
[39:29] there's a problem.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; But it's given to every man to profit
[39:34] with all. And I love that because it's
[39:36] not to to debit us, is it?
[39:39] &gt;&gt; It's to profit us.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; They're to help us. the spiritual gifts
[39:44] are to be a help to us individually and
[39:46] to help us as a body. I think it's a
[39:49] beautiful thing. So out of verse 8 in 1
[39:52] Corinthians chapter 12, he begins to
[39:54] talk to the Corinthian church, Paul the
[39:57] scribe uh for the Holy Ghost, speaking
[39:59] to the Corinthian church, bringing
[40:01] correction to set the church in order,
[40:03] the first pattern for the church that
[40:06] every other church should follow. For
[40:09] unto one is given by the spirit the word
[40:14] of wisdom.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; And to another the word of knowledge by
[40:19] the same spirit. And I just love how he
[40:22] emphasizes this all the way along. It
[40:24] doesn't go off talking about so many
[40:26] gifts that we just forget where the
[40:28] gifts come from and who the inspiration
[40:31] is behind the gifts. Every single time
[40:34] he reminds us it's by the same spirit.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by the same spirit. It's by
[40:39] the same spirit. But tonight, I want to
[40:41] talk specifically out of verse eight
[40:43] about a word of wisdom.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; And uh I'll just tell you it from a
[40:49] preaching perspective, it's a bit like
[40:51] throwing stones on a pond. You skip the
[40:54] stone and you're only going to get so
[40:56] many skips and then the rock's going to
[40:58] sink. And it's kind of the way I feel
[41:00] like I I I could probably preach on this
[41:02] really if if the Lord inspired us to go
[41:06] that way. And I don't think there'd be
[41:07] anything wrong with it, but this could
[41:09] probably be a year-long study on gifts
[41:12] alone, just talking about these uh when
[41:14] you start to really dig into it. Like
[41:16] just simply uh the word of wisdom. If
[41:18] you talk about wisdom, it's brought up
[41:20] 222 times in the King James version. And
[41:24] uh it's it's pretty neat when you start
[41:26] to really dig into it. But I just wanted
[41:28] to sort of do a highlevel fly over with
[41:31] the gifts is kind of the way I felt led
[41:32] to go with it and not really drill down
[41:35] too far. But, you know, we'll just
[41:37] follow the spirit, the leadership of the
[41:38] Lord, and see what happens with it. So,
[41:41] if we do get hung up somewhere, I hope
[41:43] it's okay. I I hope it's not a a big
[41:46] deal. We'll just trust the Lord, and I'm
[41:48] sure it will be good. But, you know, the
[41:49] very first time wisdom is spoken in the
[41:52] Bible is in Exodus chapter 28. It's the
[41:55] first mention of wisdom in uh in Exodus
[41:59] chapter 28:3. and and the Lord is
[42:02] instructing Moses in how all of the
[42:06] temple worship should take place. And if
[42:08] you ever are wondering if the Lord
[42:10] worries about details or is concerned
[42:12] about the way things are done, just go
[42:15] back and read this Old Testament
[42:17] instruction on on how he instructed
[42:20] Moses that that he wanted the temple
[42:22] worship to happen. Right down to the
[42:25] beginning part of it here in in verse
[42:27] three of Exodus 28. and thou shalt speak
[42:30] unto all that are wisehearted,
[42:34] whom I have filled with the spirit of
[42:37] wisdom. I just love that, don't you?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; The wise-hearted people are not just
[42:43] people that came from from birth. They w
[42:46] their parents didn't just eat really
[42:48] good organic pomegranates and and and
[42:50] milk and honey. They didn't just eat all
[42:52] of the best things and and have really
[42:55] really strong genetics so that they were
[42:57] wise. Although I bet people were
[42:59] probably a little bit smarter or wiser
[43:02] back in the day because they didn't have
[43:03] to contend with all the processed foods
[43:05] that we contend with. But we have people
[43:09] that were living their lives and God
[43:12] spoke to them and said that there's some
[43:14] wisehearted people whom I have filled
[43:18] with the spirit of wisdom.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; I think that's incredible because he is
[43:24] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[43:26] isn't he? Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; If we have wisdom in our lives, it's
[43:29] only because he's poured himself into
[43:32] us.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; He has given us the spirit of wisdom. I
[43:36] love that thought about the spirit of
[43:38] wisdom. When we can solve problems that
[43:40] ordinarily we couldn't solve. We heard
[43:43] it on the testimony service. Uh it's
[43:45] just incredible to see what can happen
[43:48] when there's complex problems and we
[43:50] just have no idea how to solve them. You
[43:52] ever encounter that in your life? Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; If we just go to prayer
[43:57] &gt;&gt; and give God the opportunity, it's no
[44:00] accident that we have a complex problem
[44:02] in our life.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I've been fellowshipping with
[44:05] a brother for a little while here and we
[44:07] got into a discussion about this. Is
[44:09] there such a thing as a coincidence
[44:12] &gt;&gt; in this world?
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Are there accidents?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; The world would say there is.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe even a denominational world would
[44:20] say there's coincidence. Oh, yeah.
[44:22] There's there's coincidences,
[44:24] but as a believer of the Lord, we of
[44:28] this message, full message believing
[44:30] Christian people filled with the Holy
[44:32] Ghost, we don't believe in coincidences.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as accidents.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; We didn't just happen into the the the
[44:41] chapel on the corner, the mission on the
[44:43] corner, Brother Brandham says, one day
[44:45] and just suddenly find God because we
[44:47] were seeking God. Man doesn't seek God.
[44:50] God seeks man.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't seek God when he actually
[44:55] stepped out of his first estate. What
[44:57] did he do? He created a religion and
[44:59] went and hid behind it.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; But I love this. I love this scripture
[45:05] here.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt speak unto all that are
[45:08] wisehearted, whom I have filled with the
[45:10] spirit of wisdom, that they may make
[45:11] Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that
[45:14] he may minister unto me in the priest's
[45:17] office. God cares about the details.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; He really cares about the details. You
[45:24] know, tonight I just want to really kind
[45:26] of drill down a little bit in uh First
[45:28] Kings chapter 3, if you don't mind. Uh
[45:32] talk about the wisest man that ever was.
[45:36] First Kings chapter 3.
[45:42] We know this to be Solomon.
[45:58] Right from the very start though,
[46:00] Solomon kind of stepped out
[46:04] and uh I think it's interesting because
[46:07] he showed that he was a man right from
[46:09] the very first here even though he is
[46:13] chosen
[46:15] first kings
[46:16] 3:1 says, "And Solomon made affinity
[46:19] with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and took
[46:21] Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into
[46:25] the city of David until he had made an
[46:28] end of building his own house and the
[46:31] house of the Lord, and the wall of
[46:32] Jerusalem roundabout."
[46:34] Only the people sacrificed in high
[46:36] places, because there was no house built
[46:38] unto the name of the Lord until those
[46:41] days. And Solomon loved the Lord. Isn't
[46:45] that beautiful?
[46:47] Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the
[46:50] statutes of David, his father only. He
[46:54] sacrificed and burnt incense in high
[46:56] places. If you look at it from a
[46:58] legalistic perspective, there's two
[47:00] things now. He's taken a wife from Egypt
[47:02] and he's burning sacrifices in the high
[47:05] places. Verse four says, "And the king
[47:07] went to Gibian to sacrifice there, and
[47:10] for that was the great high place. A
[47:14] thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
[47:17] offer upon that altar."
[47:20] He really wanted to worship, didn't he?
[47:23] In Gibian, the Lord appeared to Solomon
[47:25] in a dream by night, and God said, "Ask
[47:30] what I shall give thee." Did you ever
[47:32] think about this? Do you ever think
[47:34] about what it'd be like to actually go
[47:36] into a dream and and have a meeting with
[47:39] God? Just to think about that moment.
[47:42] Hey, and Solomon said, "Thou hast showed
[47:46] unto thy servant David, my father, great
[47:49] mercy, according as he walked before
[47:52] thee in truth, and in righteousness, and
[47:55] in uprightness of heart with thee. and
[47:59] thou hast kept him for this great
[48:02] kindness. And thou hast given him a son
[48:06] to sit on his throne as it is this day.
[48:12] And now, oh Lord my God, thou hast made
[48:16] thy servant king instead of David my
[48:20] father, and I am but a little child.
[48:25] I know not how to go out or come in.
[48:29] And thy servant is in the midst of thy
[48:31] people, which thou hast chosen, a great
[48:34] people, that cannot be numbered, nor
[48:36] counted for multitude.
[48:40] Give therefore thy servant an
[48:42] understanding heart.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; To judge thy people, that I may discern
[48:48] between good and bad.
[48:53] For who is able to judge this thy so
[48:57] great a people?
[49:00] And this this is the best part, isn't
[49:02] it?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased the Lord.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; That Solomon had asked this thing.
[49:10] And God said unto him, Because thou hast
[49:13] asked this thing, and hast not asked for
[49:16] thyself long life, neither hast asked
[49:20] riches for thyself, nor hast asked the
[49:24] life of thine enemies,
[49:26] but has asked for thyself understanding
[49:30] to discern judgment.
[49:33] Behold, I have done according to thy
[49:36] words. Lo, I have given thee a wise and
[49:39] understanding heart,
[49:41] &gt;&gt; so that there was none like thee before
[49:44] thee, neither after thee shall any arise
[49:48] like unto thee.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; What a declaration.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; And I have also given thee, this is the
[49:58] God we serve here. Yeah.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; This is our God.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; The one that we worshiped tonight. The
[50:03] one that's here with us right now. This
[50:05] is the one
[50:06] And I have also given thee that which
[50:09] thou hast not asked.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Both riches and honor.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; So that there shall not be any among the
[50:17] kings like unto thee all thy days.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep
[50:24] my statutes and my commandments as thy
[50:27] father David did walk, then I will
[50:30] lengthen thy days.
[50:32] My, we know that the word says, "Seek ye
[50:35] first the kingdom of God." Right?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Children, honor your parents. Why? So
[50:40] that your days might be long upon the
[50:42] earth.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; How better could you honor a father than
[50:46] to just do what he told you to do.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; To do it as he taught you how to do it.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Just an amazing thing. You know, we we
[50:54] we're looking at this here and and I
[50:56] just want to throw this in because I
[50:58] think it's it's really really good. It's
[51:00] just good for us to to remember. Let's
[51:02] turn back over to 1 Corinthians chapter
[51:05] 2.
[51:08] 1 Corinthians chapter 2.
[51:18] That's second Corinthians.
[51:20] First Corinthians.
[51:24] That's the one
[51:28] talking about
[51:31] words of wisdom.
[51:38] I think it's amazing to see that Solomon
[51:40] just had that desire in his heart and
[51:42] and God gave him the desire
[51:45] to actually be able to fulfill the role
[51:47] that he was in. But then he gave him so
[51:50] much more just because he was willing to
[51:53] surrender his will to the Lord's will.
[51:56] But, you know, in in 1 Corinthians
[51:58] chapter 2, I I just felt led to bring
[52:01] this this verse, you know, that we're
[52:02] we're not following in in in terms of
[52:05] what we're doing. We're looking for the
[52:07] leadership of the spirit in every aspect
[52:09] of our church. And I trust that we're
[52:11] looking for the spirit, the leadership
[52:13] of the spirit, the wisdom of the spirit
[52:15] in every aspect, not just of our church,
[52:17] but of our lives. and not just of our
[52:20] lives, but of our homes and our families
[52:22] and our relationships and and and our
[52:24] jobs and and our education and every
[52:27] single thing that we do. If we are
[52:30] putting the Lord first, he is the same
[52:32] as he was with Solomon to his children
[52:36] today, he's never going to leave us or
[52:38] forsake us. He will always be
[52:40] accountable to his word.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so wonderful. We don't
[52:44] have to look and think, you know, I want
[52:45] to be the wisest because there will be
[52:48] nobody as wise as Solomon is what the
[52:50] word of God said. That's just not going
[52:51] to happen. So, it would be foolish to
[52:53] ask a question like that to be wiser
[52:55] than Solomon or as wise as Solomon. But
[52:58] it would not be foolish to say, "Lord,
[53:01] help me to understand how to have
[53:03] discernment and discretion and wisdom to
[53:05] be able to live in the position that I'm
[53:07] in, that I find myself in." Especially
[53:09] when we find ourselves behind or
[53:11] underneath or in the middle of a really
[53:12] comp complex problem.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; In uh in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 2. And
[53:19] I brethren when I came to you came not
[53:22] with excellency of speech
[53:24] &gt;&gt; or of wisdom
[53:26] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[53:29] For I determined not to know anything
[53:32] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[53:35] crucified.
[53:37] and I was with you in weakness and in
[53:38] fear and in much trembling. Remember
[53:40] this is the one that was actually laying
[53:42] waste to the church. He was persecuting
[53:44] and murdering people.
[53:46] And he had to come back and actually
[53:48] preach now to the church.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; He he was in fear and in much trembling.
[53:53] And my speech and my preaching was not
[53:56] with enticing words of man's wisdom. Not
[53:59] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[54:02] of men.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:05] But it wasn't of man's wisdom, but in
[54:07] demonstration of the spirit and in
[54:10] power. Why is that? It's that your faith
[54:14] should not stand in the wisdom of men,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; but in the power of God.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; So now, as we go forwards tonight, I
[54:22] just want to make sure that we we draw a
[54:24] clear line. There is a wisdom of men
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and there is a wisdom of God. Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And if we're following the wisdom of
[54:33] men, we will not see the life, the
[54:37] demonstration of the spirit that we just
[54:39] read about here. And that's where
[54:40] brother Bradom talks about a hybrid
[54:43] religion. If you try and create a hybrid
[54:45] religion, you can and you will maybe in
[54:48] your home, maybe in your church, and
[54:50] it'll look good, it'll sound good, it'll
[54:53] it'll be good for a few years, but then
[54:56] after a while, it will start to show
[54:58] itself. How will it show itself? It
[55:01] cannot reproduce. That's the bottom line
[55:04] with a hybrid religion.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; It's a dead religion.
[55:09] But you could have a whole bunch of
[55:10] people that get together all around
[55:12] man's wisdom and there's going to be I
[55:15] heard brother Bradam say it today. The
[55:17] greatest lie ever told is 99% truth.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; 1% or one word off. Right?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want a hybrid religion. We want
[55:29] the spirit of wisdom from God. We want
[55:33] the Holy Ghost wisdom in our lives. We
[55:36] want that leadership to be what's going
[55:38] on. And how will we ever know if it's
[55:40] correct? Does it line up with the word
[55:41] of God?
[55:43] &gt;&gt; It will always line up with the word of
[55:44] God. And if it doesn't line up with the
[55:46] word of God, we don't have to make a big
[55:48] fit and a scene and maybe try and go and
[55:50] argue with people. All we need to do is
[55:52] like brother Brandham said, just leave
[55:54] it alone.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Just leave it alone.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Set it down. Say, I can't I I don't
[55:59] understand that right now in my life. I
[56:01] just maybe don't see it that way. That's
[56:03] all. But if a brother sees it that way,
[56:05] that's okay. He's still your brother,
[56:09] &gt;&gt; you know, there's 10 virgins, right?
[56:13] Five of them were wise and had oil and
[56:15] five of them were unwise and never had
[56:17] oil.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; But they all slumbered and slept
[56:20] together.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; They all worshiped together. It's not up
[56:24] to us to discern that or or even try and
[56:26] sort it out. It's not our our our issue.
[56:29] The only thing we need to do is make
[56:30] sure that we're following the wisdom of
[56:32] the word, the wisdom of the Lord, that
[56:34] is the inspiration of the spirit. And
[56:36] that's going to cause us to have oil.
[56:38] And as long as we have oil, when that
[56:40] door closes, we're going to be fine.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; But Paul, he's doing this. He's bringing
[56:46] this demonstration of the spirit and
[56:49] power that your faith should not stand
[56:51] in the wisdom of men, but in the power
[56:53] of God.
[56:55] How be it we speak wisdom among them
[56:58] that are perfect. Now remember perfect
[57:02] isn't isn't the religious perfect where
[57:06] we have everything perfect in our lives
[57:08] in our homes. We're sinless individuals
[57:10] even though we are the sinless spotless
[57:12] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. Those
[57:15] ones fit this description of perfect
[57:17] because it's mature.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; They're mature in the word. They're not
[57:22] interested in being fed milk all the
[57:24] time. I need to be pat on the back. If
[57:26] I'm going to be a deacon in the church,
[57:28] then I'll come to church. If I can
[57:30] minister in the church, then I'll come
[57:32] to church. If if I can do this, then
[57:35] that or the other. No. Strong
[57:37] Christians, they just come to church
[57:39] because that's what the word of God
[57:40] says.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be pat on the back.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How be it we speak wisdom among
[57:47] them that are perfect. Yet not the
[57:48] wisdom of this world, nor the princes of
[57:51] this world that come to not, but we
[57:54] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[57:57] even the hidden wisdom. I love that. The
[58:00] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[58:02] the world unto our glory. Now, this
[58:04] hidden wisdom, we said it already, the
[58:06] word of God is of no private
[58:07] interpretation. So, when somebody says,
[58:09] "I've got a revelation," it better line
[58:11] up with the word of God
[58:12] &gt;&gt; or we just leave it alone. like we said
[58:14] a little bit earlier, but there is no
[58:16] hidden wisdom any longer. All of that
[58:19] hidden wisdom has been revealed under
[58:22] the ministry of the seventh angel
[58:23] messenger.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That's why I think this scripture here,
[58:27] this chapter, I'm going to read the
[58:28] whole chapter. I hope it's okay tonight
[58:30] because it speaks to the age in which we
[58:31] live. So clear. I think it's just
[58:33] amazing. Verse 8 says, "Which none of
[58:36] the princes of this world knew,
[58:39] for had they known it, they would not
[58:42] have crucified the Lord of glory."
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Because that sealed the devil's doom,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; didn't it? It sealed his fate. And it
[58:51] sealed ours, too.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; I love it because it sealed ours, too.
[58:55] Our fate is sealed in God because of
[58:59] that. Verse 9 says, "But as it is
[59:01] written, I hath not seen, nor ear heard,
[59:03] neither hath entered into the heart of a
[59:05] man the things that God hath prepared
[59:07] for them that love him,
[59:10] but God had hath revealed them unto us
[59:14] by his spirit."
[59:17] You know, it just hit me as I was
[59:19] reading this, you know, brothers and
[59:20] sisters, that we talk about this many
[59:23] times. I do many times. I've always
[59:26] thought about it as that next dimension.
[59:27] Brother Brandham talked about going
[59:28] beyond the curtain of time, but it just
[59:31] struck me just now. But what about now?
[59:34] What about now?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[59:37] hath entered into the heart of a man the
[59:39] things which God hath prepared for them
[59:41] that love him right now.
[59:45] I think we can put it out there and make
[59:46] it somewhere out in the future. But what
[59:48] about right now? But God hath revealed
[59:50] them unto us by his spirit. For the
[59:53] spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[59:54] deep things of God.
[59:57] Remember, we're talking about the
[59:58] difference now between the spirit of
[1:00:01] wisdom of God and the spirit of wisdom
[1:00:04] of man. The tree of knowledge of good
[1:00:07] and evil and the tree of life. Those two
[1:00:10] spirits, they're so close
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:00:13] it were possible. So, I think it bears
[1:00:15] the discussion to talk about it here.
[1:00:17] But verse 11 says, "For what man knoweth
[1:00:20] the things of a man, save the spirit of
[1:00:24] man which is in him?
[1:00:27] Even so, the things of God knoweth no
[1:00:29] man, but the spirit of God.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; So, we mustn't think at all that we
[1:00:35] could actually just resist getting the
[1:00:37] Holy Ghost and be able to understand
[1:00:39] these hidden mysteries.
[1:00:41] To not get the Holy Ghost means that
[1:00:43] we're going to be striving with the
[1:00:45] spirit of man. And understanding
[1:00:46] according to the spirit of man, and
[1:00:48] there will still be mysteries. There
[1:00:49] will be a mysterious element to this
[1:00:52] word of God. Verse 12 says, "Now we have
[1:00:55] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:00:58] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[1:01:01] might know the things that are freely
[1:01:04] given to us of God." Now, remember,
[1:01:07] every single one of the gifts are to
[1:01:09] profit every man with all.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; these are freely given to man. So, it's
[1:01:15] beautiful to think that we could have
[1:01:16] the Holy Ghost in our life and
[1:01:18] understand the mysteries, but there's
[1:01:19] also things that we need to help us on
[1:01:22] our journeys
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; to help other people through us in our
[1:01:27] lives. Remember, brother Bradom said, he
[1:01:29] said that eternal life is not living for
[1:01:31] yourself.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; So, when we've got a gift in our life,
[1:01:37] what are we doing with it? Are we
[1:01:39] profiting or is everyone profiting?
[1:01:44] which things we also speak. Verse 13,
[1:01:46] not in the words which man's wisdom
[1:01:49] teacheth. We don't teach doctrines. We
[1:01:52] don't teach the the commandments of men
[1:01:55] as doctrines. We don't do that. If it's
[1:01:57] not in the word of God, if the prophet
[1:01:59] didn't tell us all about it and it's not
[1:02:01] in the word of God, then we just leave
[1:02:02] it alone. We don't try and go so far out
[1:02:06] on a limb and say, you know, that we've
[1:02:07] done it this way and it's always been
[1:02:09] that way and we've heard it and we've
[1:02:10] said it and we keep going with it. No,
[1:02:12] that's where we get out onto thin ice.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We're on thin ice. You're going to fall
[1:02:17] through. It's dangerous. So, we don't
[1:02:20] want to do that. But verse 13 says,
[1:02:22] "Which things also we speak not in the
[1:02:24] words which man's wisdom teacheth, but
[1:02:27] which the Holy Ghost teacheth."
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Comparing spiritual things with
[1:02:32] spiritual.
[1:02:34] But the natural man receiveth not the
[1:02:37] things of the spirit of God.
[1:02:41] for they are foolishness unto him.
[1:02:45] Fundamentalist,
[1:02:48] right? Holy rollers, cult members, all
[1:02:52] of the adjectives, all of the things,
[1:02:54] the descriptions that you could come up
[1:02:56] with for the people that actually follow
[1:02:58] the spirit of God.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; But they're foolishness unto men that
[1:03:02] follow the the spirit of men. For they
[1:03:06] are foolishness unto him. Neither can he
[1:03:08] know them, because they are spiritually
[1:03:11] discerned.
[1:03:13] But he that is spiritual judgeth all
[1:03:16] things. Yet he himself is judged of no
[1:03:19] man. For who hath known the mind of the
[1:03:21] Lord that he may instruct him?
[1:03:26] Love this last sentence.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Hey, but we have the mind of Christ.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; We have that mind. Yes.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; So this word of wisdom tonight, brothers
[1:03:36] and sisters, that we're talking about,
[1:03:37] this is for us.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; It's not for the world. It's not for the
[1:03:42] people that want to call the the move of
[1:03:45] the spirit of men. It it's it's not for
[1:03:48] those people.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. going back to our our discussion
[1:03:52] in in First Kings, how Solomon he loved
[1:03:55] the Lord and how he he he lived his life
[1:03:58] and and he had the discussion with the
[1:04:00] Lord and he had such a wonderful
[1:04:02] experience with the Lord, didn't he?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; I think it's so amazing to see this and
[1:04:08] and to think that God would actually
[1:04:10] honor his desire and give him so much
[1:04:13] wisdom.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; I I think it's it's amazing. you know
[1:04:17] the story. Um, if you go a little
[1:04:19] further in in Kings, I didn't actually
[1:04:22] write it down. I was just reading it and
[1:04:25] and I didn't want to read too much
[1:04:26] scripture and in a row, but I I was just
[1:04:29] studying the story today and and how
[1:04:31] wonderful it is. The very next story,
[1:04:33] the very first demonstration of
[1:04:34] Solomon's wisdom is the two women, the
[1:04:38] two harlots, I believe it was, sleeping
[1:04:40] in the same house.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; They both had babies. One of the babies
[1:04:44] died during the night. And when that
[1:04:46] baby died during the night, the one
[1:04:48] woman woke up and realized that she had
[1:04:50] actually suffocated the baby by sleeping
[1:04:52] with it in the bed. And what happened?
[1:04:54] She took her baby, the dead one, and
[1:04:57] gave it to the one with the live baby.
[1:04:59] And they she swapped the babies. And in
[1:05:01] the morning, the other woman woke up and
[1:05:03] realized this dead baby, what's with a
[1:05:05] dead baby here? This ain't my baby,
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And she recognized that's my baby.
[1:05:10] That's my baby's cry. That's my baby.
[1:05:13] That's my baby. She stole my baby. They
[1:05:15] find themselves going before this king
[1:05:17] now that's had this discussion with God.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And what did he say? He said, "Bring me
[1:05:22] a sword. Bring me a sword.
[1:05:26] Bring out a sword." And then he says,
[1:05:28] "Now take that sword and divide the live
[1:05:30] baby in half. Give one half to her and
[1:05:34] one half to her." What a what a wild
[1:05:37] thing to say.
[1:05:39] Amazing to think about the amount of
[1:05:41] wisdom that's there. But what happened
[1:05:43] was immediately the true mother came out
[1:05:46] and said, "No, don't c don't kill the
[1:05:47] baby. Just give the baby to the other
[1:05:49] woman."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; The the love of a mother was able to
[1:05:52] come out and actually demonstrate. And
[1:05:54] immediately that wisdom kicked in. He
[1:05:57] knew it. He was able to say, "There it
[1:05:58] is. That's the mother."
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Right there. Give that baby to her.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Just amazing to see the wisdom of God,
[1:06:06] though, isn't it?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; We have that wisdom in our midst.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; We have that wisdom in our church. And
[1:06:12] we have that wisdom in our lives.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I personally believe because of the word
[1:06:16] it says that every one of these gifts is
[1:06:19] given to profit every man with all. So
[1:06:22] there is a measure of each one of those
[1:06:24] gifts in every one of our lives.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know some people have come
[1:06:27] out with worksheets where you can
[1:06:28] actually start to test yourself and ask
[1:06:31] questions and see how many of these
[1:06:33] different boxes you can check and you
[1:06:35] can actually lean one way or the other
[1:06:36] and before you know it, you have the
[1:06:38] gift of wisdom stronger in your life
[1:06:40] than you do of discernment or or
[1:06:42] interpretation of tongues. And like I
[1:06:44] said before, we're not going to do that.
[1:06:46] I'm going to say that every single one
[1:06:47] of us, we have these in our lives. Some
[1:06:50] might have a stronger amount of others.
[1:06:52] It's whatever the spirit wants to do,
[1:06:54] isn't it? Right.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; So, as we yield oursel to the Lord as we
[1:06:59] go, I'm sure that he will reveal it to
[1:07:01] us. You know, um, talking about the
[1:07:04] spirit of wisdom, there is such an
[1:07:06] amazing book in the Bible about the
[1:07:09] spirit of wisdom and it's the
[1:07:10] instruction from the wisest man ever
[1:07:13] live and ever will live for his son. And
[1:07:17] that's the book of Proverbs. If you want
[1:07:19] to just turn over to the book of
[1:07:20] Proverbs tonight just to read a little
[1:07:22] bit there. I think it's just amazing
[1:07:24] because this is what I I read to my
[1:07:28] boys. I I want them to study this and
[1:07:32] I've even got a little bit of a
[1:07:33] challenge with them for them for a
[1:07:36] specific chapter in here just to learn
[1:07:39] it, you know, and uh but it's just
[1:07:42] wonderful to see the wisdom of this man
[1:07:44] and what would he say to his children.
[1:07:46] That's why I'm so fascinated with it.
[1:07:48] What would he say to his son? And and
[1:07:50] that's what I'm trying to say with to my
[1:07:51] son. All of them. I just would love
[1:07:54] nothing more than for them to really be
[1:07:56] able to get this. But you know, it's
[1:07:58] it's mentioned 53 times the word wisdom
[1:08:01] in the book of Proverbs. It is a very
[1:08:04] prevalent discussion in this book. But
[1:08:07] verse one of chapter 1 says, "The
[1:08:09] proverbs of Solomon, the son of David,
[1:08:11] king of Israel, to know wisdom and
[1:08:16] instruction."
[1:08:18] to know wisdom and instruction. to
[1:08:21] perceive the words of understanding,
[1:08:24] to receive the instruction of wisdom,
[1:08:27] justice, and judgment,
[1:08:30] and equity,
[1:08:33] to give subtlety to the simple, to the
[1:08:36] young man, knowledge and discretion.
[1:08:41] And you know, I I believe it with all my
[1:08:44] heart that we can take this and look at
[1:08:46] this through the lens of the spirit as
[1:08:48] we read it. There's the natural element
[1:08:50] to this and and there very much is. We
[1:08:52] know brother Brandham said it. There's a
[1:08:54] compound revelation to every single
[1:08:56] scripture. Meaning and revelation to
[1:08:58] every single scripture. But as we read
[1:09:00] this, I think it's beautiful when we
[1:09:02] talk about understanding the things of
[1:09:05] the Lord, understanding the the word of
[1:09:07] wisdom that we've been given. Because we
[1:09:09] could just summarize it right here and
[1:09:11] go home and say that we've been given a
[1:09:13] word of wisdom right here. This is the
[1:09:15] ultimate word of wisdom, the word of
[1:09:18] God. But there's so much more to it. It
[1:09:21] has to be read. It has to be opened up.
[1:09:23] You We have to peel back the scroll and
[1:09:25] and get into it, don't we? Verse five,
[1:09:28] it says that a wise man will hear
[1:09:32] and will increase learning.
[1:09:35] And a man of understanding shall attain
[1:09:37] to wise counselss.
[1:09:41] A wise man isn't going to say when
[1:09:43] someone who is elder brings something to
[1:09:45] them and says, you know, if you just
[1:09:47] tried doing it this way, they're not
[1:09:48] just going to scoff and say, ah, I don't
[1:09:50] need to hear, you know, whatever.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense, does it?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Someone who's filled with the spirit of
[1:10:00] God is going to be what's considered a
[1:10:02] wise man here. A wise man will hear and
[1:10:06] will increase learning, will desire more
[1:10:09] revelation by the word, will want to
[1:10:11] feed on the message, will want to read
[1:10:13] the word of God, will want to
[1:10:15] participate in a body, will want to go
[1:10:17] to church, will will want to serve God.
[1:10:21] Verse six says, to understand a proverb
[1:10:24] and the interpretation, the words to the
[1:10:26] wise and their dark sayings.
[1:10:29] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:10:31] knowledge.
[1:10:34] But fools despise wisdom and
[1:10:36] instruction.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You know, verse 8, N, and 10, I think,
[1:10:41] is just so good because every one of us
[1:10:44] as a son or a daughter of God, I I
[1:10:46] believe that we could say it that way.
[1:10:48] My daughter, hear the instruction of thy
[1:10:50] father. My son, hear the instruction of
[1:10:52] thy father. And forsake not the law of
[1:10:55] thy mother. For they shall be an
[1:10:57] ornament of grace unto thy head and
[1:10:59] chains about thy neck.
[1:11:02] boy and my my son, if sinners entice
[1:11:05] thee, consent thou not. And and you
[1:11:08] know, we can go down a long ways with
[1:11:09] that, and I don't want to tonight for
[1:11:11] the sake of time, but I I just think
[1:11:13] it's a wonderful thing to think that a
[1:11:16] wise man will hear and increase
[1:11:20] knowledge.
[1:11:21] Won't just say, "No, I don't need to
[1:11:23] learn anymore. I I've heard it all. What
[1:11:25] else are you going to tell me?" You
[1:11:27] know, if we turn over to Proverbs
[1:11:28] chapter 2, verse two,
[1:11:31] proverbs 2 verse two.
[1:11:37] Ah, we'll just read verse one. We might
[1:11:38] as well. He's addressing it to his son
[1:11:40] again. He says verse one of chapter 2
[1:11:42] says, "My son, if thou wilt receive my
[1:11:45] words, and hide my commandments with
[1:11:48] thee,
[1:11:50] so that thou will incline thine ear unto
[1:11:53] wisdom,
[1:11:55] and apply thine heart to understanding.
[1:12:00] Ya, if thou criest after knowledge, and
[1:12:03] liftest up thy voice for understanding,
[1:12:07] if thou seekest her as silver, and
[1:12:11] searcheth for her as hid treasures, if
[1:12:15] we make this desire for wisdom of the
[1:12:18] Lord, wisdom by the spirit, if we make
[1:12:21] that desire, just like we make the
[1:12:22] desire for all of the other things in
[1:12:24] our life,
[1:12:27] sorry,
[1:12:30] If thou seekest her as silver, and
[1:12:32] searches for her as hid treasures, then
[1:12:35] shalt thou understand the fear of the
[1:12:38] Lord, and find the knowledge of the
[1:12:40] Lord.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; For the Lord giveth wisdom.
[1:12:45] Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
[1:12:48] understanding.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He layeth up sound wisdom for the
[1:12:52] righteous. Isn't that beautiful? He is a
[1:12:55] buckler to them that walk uprightly. And
[1:12:58] and that word buckler is is a shield, a
[1:13:01] protector. He is a buckler for those
[1:13:04] that walk uprightly.
[1:13:07] Talking about the wisdom, the word of
[1:13:10] wisdom, having the word of wisdom in our
[1:13:12] lives is such a beautiful thing.
[1:13:17] Excuse me.
[1:13:20] But if if thou wilt incline thine ear,
[1:13:23] if thou wilt receive my words, hide my
[1:13:27] commandments with thee. You know, it's
[1:13:29] uh it's a scripture, isn't it? Thy word
[1:13:31] have I hid in mine heart that I might
[1:13:33] not sin against thee. And we know what
[1:13:35] is sinning. Sinning is unbelief.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; We believe this word of God. It's not
[1:13:39] something that's that's out there.
[1:13:45] So, we incline our ears. I think it's
[1:13:48] just a wonderful thing. What a gift it
[1:13:49] is to have even the desire to do it.
[1:13:51] Isn't it?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Out of the message
[1:13:55] love,
[1:13:56] brother Brandham talking about gifts.
[1:14:00] Talking about the the different gifts in
[1:14:02] the body.
[1:14:08] He says, I think love is the greatest
[1:14:10] force there is in the world.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; There's nothing more powerful than love.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember
[1:14:20] this is a brother, brother Brandham is
[1:14:22] the one. He had such a tremendous
[1:14:25] healing campaign, such a tremendous
[1:14:28] campaign ministry seven times around the
[1:14:30] world praying for kings and potentates.
[1:14:34] But listen to his words here. If I had
[1:14:36] the choice tonight and was a sinner and
[1:14:40] was standing here before God and he have
[1:14:43] said now boy I'm going to give you all
[1:14:46] nine spiritual gifts. I'm going to let
[1:14:49] you prophesy, give you the spirit of
[1:14:51] prophecy. I'm going to make you a mighty
[1:14:54] preacher. Give you the word of wisdom
[1:14:56] and understanding.
[1:14:58] I'm going to give you the gift to speak
[1:15:01] in tongues and interpret.
[1:15:04] I'm going to give you a gift of healing
[1:15:07] that you'll have great faith for the
[1:15:09] sick and I'm going to do all these
[1:15:13] things for you.
[1:15:16] I'll give you all of that
[1:15:18] or I won't let you have any of those,
[1:15:21] but I'll let you have real love in your
[1:15:23] heart.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; I'd say, God, give me that love.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; For where there is tongues, they shall
[1:15:34] cease.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; For where there's prophecy, it will
[1:15:37] fail.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Where there's knowledge, it'll vanish.
[1:15:43] But where there's love, it will endure
[1:15:45] forever.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; That's what drove the heart of God to
[1:15:50] send Christ to the earth.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That love. Hey, and we know that brother
[1:15:55] Brandham was quoting from 1 Corinthians
[1:15:57] chapter 13 verse 8 says, Charity never
[1:16:00] faileth, and that's love. And that's the
[1:16:03] Holy Ghost.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost never faileth. But where
[1:16:08] there be prophecies, they shall fail.
[1:16:10] Where there be tongues, they shall
[1:16:11] cease. Where there be knowledge, it
[1:16:13] shall vanish away. For we know in part,
[1:16:17] and we prophesy in part.
[1:16:21] But when that which is
[1:16:23] mature is come, when that which is
[1:16:26] perfect is come,
[1:16:29] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:16:30] away.
[1:16:32] There's going to be no need to going and
[1:16:34] looking for milk for the the pat you on
[1:16:37] the back messages, the ones that are
[1:16:39] just going to make us feel good so that
[1:16:42] we can say that we're a body. We're
[1:16:44] looking for a body change. We're not
[1:16:46] looking to get comfortable in this body,
[1:16:48] brothers and sisters. It's going home
[1:16:50] time. But you know, I can I can see it
[1:16:53] loud and clear, and I trust you can
[1:16:54] tonight, too, that that which is perfect
[1:16:57] is come.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; The fully mature word has come.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be a maturing of
[1:17:04] the word. Huh?
[1:17:07] I think that's amazing to think about.
[1:17:10] We're at the maximum potential of the
[1:17:12] word right now. God sent his messenger.
[1:17:16] He gave him the book and he opened it
[1:17:18] up. He He revealed all of the hidden
[1:17:20] mysteries. We have the full potential of
[1:17:23] this book in our hands right now. All of
[1:17:27] the word of wisdom in our hands right
[1:17:30] now. I think this is a wonderful thing.
[1:17:33] We can get into knowledge. We're not
[1:17:35] going to tonight. I just want to do a
[1:17:37] little bit of a comparison right now as
[1:17:39] we kind of come in for a close tonight
[1:17:42] if that's okay. You know, we have the
[1:17:44] word of of wisdom according to the
[1:17:46] spirit of God, but then we have the word
[1:17:48] of wisdom according to the spirit of
[1:17:50] man. And and like I mentioned at the
[1:17:52] very beginning, Solomon, he actually
[1:17:55] stepped out and took himself an Egyptian
[1:17:57] wife. We he was supposed to have an
[1:18:01] Israeli wife, a bride who was a Hebrew
[1:18:04] wife, not someone from without. But
[1:18:07] that's what he did and that's how it
[1:18:09] started. And unfortunately, it's how it
[1:18:11] ended in his life. I'm sure we're all
[1:18:13] familiar with it, but you know, I want
[1:18:15] to talk about what brother Bradom said
[1:18:16] about it first before we get into it.
[1:18:18] Maybe we'll actually let's let's let's
[1:18:21] read it first out of First Kings 11.
[1:18:24] First Kings chapter 11.
[1:18:27] First Kings
[1:18:30] 11.
[1:18:35] I apologize. Sometimes I just get
[1:18:37] nervous.
[1:18:39] First Kings chapter 11.
[1:18:43] Verse one,
[1:18:46] but King Solomon loved many strange
[1:18:48] women
[1:18:50] together with the daughter of Pharaoh.
[1:18:53] Mentioned right off the top.
[1:18:56] Many strange women along with the
[1:18:58] daughter of Pharaoh, women of the
[1:19:01] Moabites, the Ammonites, the
[1:19:05] the Zidonians,
[1:19:07] and the Hittites.
[1:19:09] And you know, I just as I was studying
[1:19:12] this, I was thinking, you know, if he
[1:19:13] would have taken a Hebrew wife, would he
[1:19:15] have taken one of each of those?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; But you know what happens is once we
[1:19:21] actually step,
[1:19:23] just one step into a sin, one step into
[1:19:27] a transgression, it can be so much
[1:19:29] easier to just take one more step
[1:19:31] because we've already taken a step.
[1:19:32] We're already there. That's what the
[1:19:33] devil says. You're already here. It's
[1:19:34] not going to be that big of a deal. It's
[1:19:36] going to be two feet more. Who cares?
[1:19:37] just go ahead. Right? But before long,
[1:19:40] we can find ourselves in a position
[1:19:42] that's not good. What I'm saying is he
[1:19:45] moved away from the wisdom of God, that
[1:19:49] word of wisdom that God gave him, and he
[1:19:51] moved into the wisdom of man, looking at
[1:19:54] the flesh, the lust of the flesh, right?
[1:19:56] But King Solomon loved many strange
[1:19:58] women together with the daughter of
[1:19:59] Pharaoh,
[1:20:02] women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
[1:20:04] Zidonians, and Hittites,
[1:20:08] of the nations concerning which the Lord
[1:20:11] said unto the children of Israel, "Ye
[1:20:14] shall not go into them, neither shall
[1:20:17] they come in unto you." So God probably
[1:20:21] didn't say to Solomon in his dream,
[1:20:24] "Don't go and do this." But he just took
[1:20:28] it and actually, I would say, understood
[1:20:31] that Solomon would understand all of
[1:20:34] that.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; That would just be ingrained in who
[1:20:37] Solomon was because David was a man
[1:20:39] after Solomon's own heart, wasn't he?
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; After God's own heart, I mean, not
[1:20:43] Solomon's heart.
[1:20:45] Although David had some things in his
[1:20:47] life that God had to get out of him.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; We all have things in our lives that God
[1:20:52] has to get out of us.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But he said says here in verse two, "Ye
[1:20:56] shall not go you shall not go into them,
[1:20:59] neither shall they come in unto you, for
[1:21:02] surely they will turn away your heart
[1:21:05] after their gods."
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Says here that Solomon clave unto these
[1:21:11] in love.
[1:21:14] And he had 700 wives.
[1:21:18] I
[1:21:19] just don't even have words.
[1:21:24] 700 W. The first time I read that, I
[1:21:26] just about fell off my chair. 700 wives,
[1:21:30] princesses,
[1:21:32] and 300 concupines.
[1:21:36] And his wives turned away his heart.
[1:21:41] Right from the very start, the very
[1:21:43] first thing he did, he transgressed the
[1:21:46] commandment of God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And God still honored him in his
[1:21:51] position
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; because he asked the right thing. He had
[1:21:54] the right words, but he didn't realize
[1:21:57] that this this thing was going to
[1:21:59] actually haunt him, did he? He didn't he
[1:22:01] didn't know that that was going to be
[1:22:03] the way it would happen. Verse four
[1:22:06] says, "For it came to pass that when
[1:22:07] Solomon was old, that his wives turned
[1:22:10] away his heart after other gods, and his
[1:22:14] heart was not perfect with the Lord his
[1:22:17] God, as was the heart of David his
[1:22:20] father." Why was David's heart perfect
[1:22:23] before the Lord? Because he was quick to
[1:22:26] repent.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; David was quick to repent. That's why he
[1:22:31] was a man after God's own heart. And and
[1:22:34] it's such a sad thing to look at, to
[1:22:36] think that that would be the case. The
[1:22:37] man who WAS THE WISEST MAN, NOBODY
[1:22:40] BEFORE HIM, NOBODY EVER after him to be
[1:22:43] that wise
[1:22:46] would actually have that kind of an
[1:22:48] ending, that kind of a transgression in
[1:22:50] his life. Now, I wonder I'll throw this
[1:22:53] out there. Someone might know the quote,
[1:22:54] and I'm sure you'll flip it to me if you
[1:22:56] do, and I appreciate it when you do
[1:22:57] that. Is Solomon going to be there?
[1:23:03] Whose decision is that? It ain't mine.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But I wonder that is he going to be
[1:23:08] there?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Saul who was an enemy of God.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; He's there.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Jonah the backslider.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said he wasn't backsliding
[1:23:21] a bit.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; He was in the will of God. That's what
[1:23:24] that's what the prophet said out of
[1:23:26] 1950. The angel on the commission.
[1:23:30] Brother Brandham, he says, 'Now, let's
[1:23:31] just get right down to our hearts now,
[1:23:35] and I want to tell you something, and we
[1:23:38] want to talk just for a few moments,
[1:23:42] just heart-to-heart.
[1:23:43] Don't you like that?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; How many of us would just love to have a
[1:23:48] meeting like that with a prophet?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Nowadays, I would love that. That would
[1:23:53] be so good. It would be so helpful,
[1:23:55] wouldn't it? Just to have a real
[1:23:56] heart-to-he heart with the prophet of
[1:23:58] God.
[1:24:00] I know there was a day in my life where
[1:24:01] I said I would never ever because I know
[1:24:04] who I am and I don't want him to know.
[1:24:08] But now let's just get right down to our
[1:24:10] hearts now. And I want to tell you
[1:24:12] something and we want to talk for just a
[1:24:16] few moments just hearttoheart. Now I
[1:24:18] realize and you realize too and
[1:24:22] ministers that a man can take a divine
[1:24:25] gift which is all that we had read about
[1:24:28] here in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. These
[1:24:30] are divine gifts that a man can take a
[1:24:33] divine gift send his soul to hell with
[1:24:36] it.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying
[1:24:40] that Solomon's going to hell.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that. But what I am
[1:24:44] saying is that you can have a divine
[1:24:46] gift. He had a gift of wisdom that God
[1:24:49] gave him because of the way he asked.
[1:24:52] God gave it to him. You can have that
[1:24:54] gift and still be wrong. Still actually
[1:24:59] be off the mark with it. But he says
[1:25:02] here that you can have a divine gift and
[1:25:03] send his soul to hell with it.
[1:25:06] You know that
[1:25:08] a gift from God. Now I don't mean just
[1:25:11] something that you imagine. I mean, if
[1:25:14] God has really given something and given
[1:25:17] it to your charge, you've got to use
[1:25:20] that with the wisdom of God.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; How do you use the wisdom of God?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Only by the spirit.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Only by the spirit. That's the only way
[1:25:32] that you'll ever use it. He says, "Now,
[1:25:35] I've I've never in my life talked to a
[1:25:38] congregation like this. This this gets
[1:25:41] my attention when I hear the prophet say
[1:25:42] things like this. I've never in my life
[1:25:44] talked to a congregation like this,
[1:25:46] especially a congregation of healing
[1:25:48] campaign. But the thing that I want to
[1:25:51] see, I want it so bad. And that's the
[1:25:54] reason I'm talking to you the way I am.
[1:25:56] Now remember, divine gifts can easily
[1:25:59] get a person into trouble.
[1:26:02] that God, if he finds someone that he
[1:26:06] figures that he can entrust a divine
[1:26:08] gift with, we should reverence with all
[1:26:11] of our hearts.
[1:26:14] A man can actually be deceived if he is
[1:26:18] not living according to the word of God.
[1:26:21] He goes on to say, "Now you remember how
[1:26:23] many believes Moses was a divine-ged
[1:26:26] prophet of God?" He was. Everyone
[1:26:30] believes that. But Moses with that same
[1:26:33] divine gift got himself in trouble.
[1:26:38] And we know how he did.
[1:26:40] God told him, said, "You go speak to the
[1:26:42] rock." He already smitten the rock once.
[1:26:46] Said, "Go speak to the rock."
[1:26:50] And that rock was Christ. Is that right?
[1:26:52] And Christ wasn't smitten the second
[1:26:54] time. We just speak to him now. He was
[1:26:58] smitten once. and he brought forth the
[1:27:00] waters of life. And we just speak to the
[1:27:03] rock now and it brings forth the waters
[1:27:06] like God so loved the world.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; The rock in the wilderness was a perfect
[1:27:11] of John 3:16.
[1:27:14] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:27:16] only begotten son and whosoever
[1:27:18] believeth on him should not perish but
[1:27:20] have everlasting life. Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Those Israelites were perishing and the
[1:27:26] rock was smitten and brought forth life
[1:27:29] and water.
[1:27:32] It's amazing too when you look at it. I
[1:27:34] don't know how how many people here have
[1:27:35] actually been there to see that rock. I
[1:27:38] don't even know if you can in the land
[1:27:39] of Israel if you can actually see that
[1:27:41] rock. It's on Mount Si,
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But there's pictures of it if you look
[1:27:45] it up online. And it's tremendous to
[1:27:47] think that enough water to feed two
[1:27:49] million people could come gushing out of
[1:27:52] a rock. But we know just in in light of
[1:27:55] this quote here, Moses, he actually
[1:27:58] broke the type because Christ was that
[1:28:01] rock and he was to be smitten once.
[1:28:04] And he was told to go and speak to the
[1:28:06] rock, not to smite it. But what happened
[1:28:08] was he got under the influence of man's
[1:28:10] wisdom. But the ram talks about it later
[1:28:12] in the message. He says that he got his
[1:28:14] temper. his temper got a hold of him and
[1:28:16] he actually did that. And you know that
[1:28:18] he had to pay a price for it as well. He
[1:28:20] wasn't able to see this promised land
[1:28:22] that he was leading the people to.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; What a terrible thing that would be,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; But we know that he comes back and he
[1:28:29] does what he needs to do according to
[1:28:31] the word in uh in Revelations. And that
[1:28:34] day is coming. It's never been closer
[1:28:36] actually. Um for now though tonight
[1:28:39] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:28:41] remind us that one is given by the
[1:28:43] spirit the word of wisdom.
[1:28:46] God will use an individual to have that
[1:28:49] word of wisdom just at the right time.
[1:28:51] And we know in another place in the
[1:28:52] scripture it talks about having a word
[1:28:54] fitly spoken. And the reason for that is
[1:28:57] there is a word of wisdom by the spirit
[1:28:59] that God will use in our life. And
[1:29:02] sometimes I think it's just beautiful.
[1:29:04] We were talking about it this weekend,
[1:29:06] how we can have a conversation about
[1:29:08] something with an individual and not
[1:29:10] even know anything about their life and
[1:29:13] suddenly there will be a whole uh shock
[1:29:16] and awe thing that happens where they
[1:29:19] will think that someone told you all
[1:29:21] about their life and and you will have
[1:29:23] just been talking by your own heart. You
[1:29:26] won't even understand what you have
[1:29:27] said, but they will think that you
[1:29:29] actually know something about their
[1:29:31] life. But what is that? That is a word
[1:29:33] of wisdom. Sometimes it's just maybe
[1:29:36] what we would call coincidental in the
[1:29:39] world, right? Where it doesn't really
[1:29:41] mean anything, but you would still say
[1:29:43] something that would actually mean
[1:29:44] something to an individual. And other
[1:29:46] times it would be something that would
[1:29:48] come from the pulpit. And it could be as
[1:29:50] simple as as maybe just an individual
[1:29:52] shaking someone's hand coming into
[1:29:54] church saying, you know, how you doing?
[1:29:56] I've had you on my heart. Did you have a
[1:29:58] headache this week? It could be
[1:30:00] something as simple as that. and and
[1:30:02] them not knowing that you had one, but
[1:30:06] you're shocked because they know the
[1:30:09] word of wisdom. It's all about the
[1:30:11] spirit and how God will operate that.
[1:30:14] And I just want to encourage us,
[1:30:16] brothers and sisters, to not be afraid
[1:30:18] of it, but to actually understand that
[1:30:21] God chooses to operate according to the
[1:30:23] gifts of the spirit in the church.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And uh we're going to get into uh the
[1:30:28] rest of them. Next one we'll talk about
[1:30:30] the word of knowledge. It's by the same
[1:30:32] spirit. So uh I think this beautiful
[1:30:36] stuff in there because it overlaps as we
[1:30:38] read in Proverbs. Some of the scriptures
[1:30:40] in Proverbs talks about getting wisdom
[1:30:43] and the wisdom will actually lead to
[1:30:45] knowledge and uh we just trust the Lord.
[1:30:48] It's certainly wonderful to to be in
[1:30:51] service for him. But you know just like
[1:30:53] Solomon, he started out wrong. If it
[1:30:56] starts out wrong, it can't end up right.
[1:30:59] It can potentially, but it just takes
[1:31:02] surrender, complete surrender to the
[1:31:04] word. I'll call the musicians up
[1:31:06] tonight.
[1:31:08] You know, in uh I'm just going to read
[1:31:09] this scripture again here. And and in
[1:31:12] light of that quote that brother Bradom
[1:31:14] said, how we can have a gift in our life
[1:31:17] and uh a divine gift in fact, but still
[1:31:21] not actually use it the right way. It's
[1:31:24] right out of the scripture here. Solomon
[1:31:26] loved many strange women.
[1:31:29] And uh you know it can it can take us so
[1:31:32] far away from where we want to be.
[1:31:35] And if if you look at the scripture, you
[1:31:38] can see how some of his wives actually
[1:31:41] encouraged him. And I think it's it's
[1:31:44] shocking when you look at it because
[1:31:46] they didn't actually persuade him away
[1:31:49] from worship. They just persuaded him to
[1:31:52] worship their way.
[1:31:55] So, it's not actually a raging monster.
[1:31:58] They're probably beautiful women and
[1:32:00] very, very kind and smart, but they just
[1:32:03] changed his way of worship. And that's
[1:32:05] what God told them would happen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; If you actually follow the women in the
[1:32:09] land, they're going to change your heart
[1:32:11] towards me. They'll take you away from
[1:32:14] me. And and you know, in the day in
[1:32:16] which we live, there's so many things.
[1:32:18] women is just one of the things we we
[1:32:21] all have things if we're not careful by
[1:32:24] the spirit. If we don't have that word
[1:32:27] of wisdom in our lives, if we're not
[1:32:29] surrendering ourselves to the spirit, we
[1:32:31] will be carried away unto those devices
[1:32:35] that will change our heart. And I just
[1:32:37] want to encourage us, we don't have to
[1:32:39] go there. It doesn't have to be that
[1:32:41] way.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; we can actually have the right outcome.
[1:32:44] But the only way that's going to happen
[1:32:45] is to surrender ourselves fully to the
[1:32:47] spirit of God. Maybe stand with me as we
[1:32:50] close tonight.
[1:32:52] Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:32:55] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[1:32:57] your word of wisdom.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your open book, Lord, that
[1:33:02] you've given to us in the day in which
[1:33:04] we live.
[1:33:06] Lord, that we don't have to clamor over
[1:33:09] mysteries, wondering,
[1:33:12] asking.
[1:33:14] Lord Jesus, we can thank you for [music]
[1:33:17] giving to us the fully revealed word in
[1:33:20] the day in which we live. And we just
[1:33:22] ask, Lord, [music] that we could also
[1:33:24] have that word of wisdom in our lives,
[1:33:27] Lord, where we would recognize this book
[1:33:29] [music] to be fully open and that
[1:33:31] there's no no seals that are still
[1:33:34] closed. every seal is opened and your
[1:33:37] prophet declared it when he was here on
[1:33:39] earth. And we know that that's why you
[1:33:42] took him home, Lord, because he came and
[1:33:44] did exactly what you wanted him to do.
[1:33:47] And because of that, he was able to go
[1:33:50] on to his reward. And and [music] that's
[1:33:52] how you operate, Father. As soon as we
[1:33:54] accomplish that which you have for us on
[1:33:57] this life, in this life, you take us
[1:34:01] home, Lord. You you graduate us. And
[1:34:03] Father, we're so thankful for your way.
[1:34:06] It's not our way, Lord Jesus, but we
[1:34:08] trust you. And Lord, we commit all of
[1:34:11] our ways into your hands tonight.
[1:34:14] Father, if there's any of us that maybe
[1:34:16] have strayed, we pray that you would
[1:34:18] just forgive us, Lord, and allow us to
[1:34:20] come back, Lord Jesus, to where we left
[1:34:23] off because you never left.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; The only thing that happens is we
[1:34:27] [music] stray from you, Father.
[1:34:29] So Lord, tonight I pray that if we have
[1:34:31] strayed that you would just allow us to
[1:34:33] come right back to where we started
[1:34:35] straying. Father, that we don't wind up
[1:34:37] in a situation like Solomon where we're
[1:34:39] so far removed, where we just can't even
[1:34:42] see our [music] way back. Father, we
[1:34:45] love you tonight and we thank you and we
[1:34:47] pray that you would just be with those
[1:34:48] [music]
[1:34:49] who couldn't be here tonight, Father.
[1:34:51] Some traveling and maybe some at home
[1:34:53] sick or at work. wherever they are.
[1:34:56] Father, we just thank you for them and
[1:34:58] we pray that you would just continue to
[1:34:59] keep your hand upon them. Lord,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would be with our
[1:35:03] travelers [music] tonight. Father, that
[1:35:05] Lord, you would bless them and give them
[1:35:07] traveling mercies on their way back
[1:35:09] home. And if it be your will for us to
[1:35:11] gather again on Sunday, Lord, we'll
[1:35:14] certainly give you the praise. And
[1:35:16] Father, we just want to also [music] ask
[1:35:18] as a body that you would bless the youth
[1:35:20] meeting on Friday night. Lord, while the
[1:35:23] world celebrates the devil, Lord Jesus,
[1:35:26] the youth here, [music]
[1:35:28] we're going to celebrate you, Father.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; We just pray that you would just pour
[1:35:32] yourself [music] out through all of the
[1:35:34] individuals who attend that service.
[1:35:37] Father, we just love you and thank you.
[1:35:38] We ask all these things in Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ's name [music] we pray.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:52] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; You want want to start [music] it?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; It's not the one.
[1:36:10] Could we sing maybe 11:22?
[1:36:13] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:36:21] Oh, this is my [music and singing]
[1:36:23] desire
[1:36:27] to honor
[1:36:31] [music] you.
[1:36:35] Lord, [singing] with all
[1:36:38] my heart
[1:36:41] I worship you. [music]
[1:36:51] All [singing]
[1:36:51] I [music] have within me,
[1:36:57] Lord, I give
[1:37:00] you [music and singing]
[1:37:02] praise.
[1:37:06] All [music and singing] that I
[1:37:09] know
[1:37:12] is [music and singing]
[1:37:22] Lord. [music and singing] I give you my
[1:37:25] heart.
[1:37:27] I give you my soul. [music and singing]
[1:37:33] I live [music] for [singing] you.
[1:37:38] Every breath that [music] I
[1:37:47] [music]
[1:37:49] have [singing]
[1:37:51] with me. Is this your desire tonight?
[1:37:57] This is [music]
[1:37:59] my [singing]
[1:38:00] desire.
[1:38:05] to [music]
[1:38:13] [music]
[1:38:14] all
[1:38:16] my heart.
[1:38:19] I [music and singing] worship you.
[1:38:25] [music]
[1:38:29] All [singing] I have
[1:38:32] within
[1:38:36] [music] I
[1:38:45] [singing]
[1:38:48] [music]
[1:38:51] is
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, [music and singing] I give you my
[1:39:04] heart.
[1:39:06] I give you my [music] soul.
[1:39:12] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[1:39:38] Can we change the the tempo a little
[1:39:41] bit? Sing 507.

[1:41:13] Oh, what a wonderful [singing]
[1:41:16] hour. [music]
