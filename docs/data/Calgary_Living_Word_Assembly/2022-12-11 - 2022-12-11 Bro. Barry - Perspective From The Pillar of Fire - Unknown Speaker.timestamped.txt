[48:31] around the world father Lord Jesus we
[48:33] know that it's only by your grace that
[48:35] we stand it's only by your grace that we
[48:38] have the ability to hear this word for
[48:40] our day and Lord Jesus we thank you for
[48:42] that we pray that you would just keep
[48:44] your hand upon us now as we go together
[48:47] through your word father as we just Lord
[48:50] as you speak to us along the way we just
[48:53] ask all these things now in Jesus
[48:55] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[48:57] today you may be seated
[49:01] I uh
[49:03] I just think it's wonderful
[49:06] wonderful to look at this word for our
[49:09] day and and really where we are today
[49:13] we've come
[49:14] many miles
[49:16] through many dangers toils and snares we
[49:19] have already come
[49:21] you know we've been talking about
[49:24] possessing our land possessing our
[49:26] inheritance and and walking into the
[49:29] promised land ourselves and the baptism
[49:32] of the Holy Ghost which really is all of
[49:35] the above the aforementioned
[49:38] our our promised land and our Holy Ghost
[49:40] our our promised land and our
[49:43] inheritance I mean is the Holy Ghost and
[49:45] we know brother Branham said that the
[49:46] Holy Ghost is the earnest it's the down
[49:49] payment of our inheritance because we
[49:51] know that when this body be dissolved we
[49:55] have a body already waiting
[49:57] and it's a tabernacle that's not made
[49:59] with hands it's one that's incorruptible
[50:02] it's our our treasure laid up for us in
[50:05] heaven and I think many times we can
[50:07] think about the treasure that's laid up
[50:08] for us in heaven and look at mounds of
[50:10] gold and and diamonds and gems and maybe
[50:13] a mansion up on the hill and maybe all
[50:15] of that's there but you know the
[50:17] greatest thing that we could ever
[50:18] experience is the ability to be able to
[50:21] hear the word in the age in which we
[50:23] live brother Bradham says the greatest
[50:24] Miracle you can type in greatest Miracle
[50:27] into the message of the hour and brother
[50:28] Bradham will say the greatest Miracle
[50:30] isn't being raised from the dead it's
[50:32] not being healed of cancer it's not
[50:34] being raised up from any illness it's
[50:36] being able to be transformed by the
[50:38] renewing of your mind to be able to be a
[50:41] new creature created in Christ Jesus to
[50:44] be able to receive the word for your day
[50:46] is the greatest miracle the
[50:49] transformation not the confirmation not
[50:52] to say that I go to a church and I I
[50:54] believe the way they believe so I know
[50:56] that I've got it and we're a happy group
[50:58] together that's not going to do it the
[51:01] greatest Miracle is being able to just
[51:02] take the word and say be it unto me
[51:04] according to Thy word and if I can't
[51:07] take maybe what I hear a pastor say I'm
[51:10] just going to spit that pit out I'm
[51:12] gonna throw that bone away and I'm just
[51:14] going to take the word of God and say
[51:16] hey he's going to want me to see it he's
[51:18] going to reveal it to me the way he
[51:19] wants it to be revealed
[51:22] but you know when we start to walk after
[51:24] the flesh then we start to actually spit
[51:27] out chicken with that bone and maybe a
[51:30] little bit of cherry with that pit and
[51:33] we don't want to do that
[51:35] brother Bradham says it very clearly you
[51:37] know what just go ahead and spit it out
[51:38] take out that bone if you don't want to
[51:40] eat a bone when you're eating chicken
[51:41] but look at it real good and make sure
[51:43] that it's just bone sometimes you get
[51:46] chicken that's cooked really hard
[51:48] and I'll never forget it I'll call them
[51:51] my African parents brother man told me
[51:53] in Africa he said I bet you like to eat
[51:56] soft meat don't you you like to chew
[51:59] soft meat and I said well yeah I kind of
[52:01] do while I was chewing through what I
[52:03] thought was a rooster a terribly old
[52:05] rooster it was so hard and he said you
[52:08] know we like to cook our meat really
[52:10] tough here in Africa and it just made me
[52:13] laugh but you know
[52:14] it might not be the way that I'm used to
[52:16] eating it but it doesn't matter if it's
[52:18] still chicken I need that protein in my
[52:20] body and if it's still the word of God
[52:22] we need to make sure that we're eating
[52:24] the word of God and we're not just
[52:25] throwing away the protein
[52:28] we're talking about possessing our land
[52:30] and you know I just thought it was a
[52:33] wonderful thought that possession we
[52:35] know we've heard it said carnally
[52:36] speaking is nine tenths of the law
[52:39] the children of Israel when they were on
[52:40] this side of Jordan when they were on
[52:43] the other side of Jordan when they
[52:45] weren't in the promised land they had
[52:46] nothing they had the god of Israel with
[52:49] them so they had everything don't get me
[52:51] wrong but they knew their destination
[52:52] was on the other side and once they were
[52:55] over there then everything was settled
[52:58] and we talked about it last week
[53:00] about how maybe sometimes when we have a
[53:03] situation in our lives if we can just
[53:05] change our perspective on the situation
[53:07] and zoom out and look at the situation
[53:11] from the pillar of fire instead of
[53:13] looking at the pillar of fire and and
[53:15] look at the situation from the cloud
[53:18] instead of just looking at it at the
[53:20] cloud we know the children of Israel we
[53:22] read it last week in Exodus when they
[53:25] were out of Egypt they had seen all the
[53:27] signs and wonders and they got
[53:28] themselves up against the Red Sea and up
[53:30] against the mountain and now Pharaoh's
[53:32] Army was coming after them and they
[53:33] started to murmur after Moses to say now
[53:36] you took us out of safety where we were
[53:38] just going to get beat every day and
[53:40] mistreated everything would happen to us
[53:42] anything could happen to us you took us
[53:44] out of that kind of insecurity to this
[53:47] now that we would die in the desert
[53:49] instead of saying you know what look at
[53:51] all the mighty miracles signs and
[53:53] wonders that he did there that same God
[53:55] has to be with us in fact look at that
[53:56] Pillar of Fire look at that cloud that's
[53:59] the one that's leading us
[54:01] but yet they got in the moment and
[54:03] started to look at the flesh to say oh
[54:06] no here comes the enemy oh no we're
[54:08] gonna die now we perish now what
[54:12] if we could just take a look at our
[54:14] situations from a different perspective
[54:17] I think it would be wonderful
[54:19] and I just want to try and encourage us
[54:20] to do that let's not look at the pillar
[54:22] of Fire Let's look from the pillar of
[54:24] fire because really that Pillar of Fire
[54:27] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:29] and forever Elohim God himself the Holy
[54:32] Ghost choose your title it's the same
[54:35] one it's the same God
[54:37] but possession is nine tenths of the law
[54:40] and you know when we can get into our
[54:42] promised land when we can get the Holy
[54:43] Ghost in our life we know we've said it
[54:46] many times that the battle is just going
[54:48] to start but you know brothers and
[54:49] sisters it's not going to be a battle as
[54:51] we think and that's the beautiful part
[54:53] about it it's not going to be swords
[54:55] drawn and blood flowing it's not going
[54:57] to be that kind of a battle the Lord
[54:59] isn't going to see us destroyed
[55:01] Satan's going to come around and tempt
[55:03] us that's what's going to happen we're
[55:04] going to see Temptations all over the
[55:06] place but what's going to happen is
[55:08] we're going to be able to overcome them
[55:11] we're not going to be destroyed
[55:14] but Satan's going to say no no no now
[55:16] now you've gone all this way you've
[55:17] taken all the steps you've spread your
[55:19] wings of Faith now and you've given up
[55:22] all that you thought you had and you
[55:24] knew and you're going by faith now and
[55:26] and now you've got this problem where's
[55:28] this good that's what Satan's going to
[55:30] be saying and he's going to be saying
[55:32] yeah look watch what I want to do for
[55:34] you watch what I want to do for you in
[55:36] this situation and you know you might
[55:38] hear the Deliverance through listening
[55:41] to a tape you might hear it listening to
[55:43] a minister somewhere you might hear it
[55:44] from a minister from a Pulpit you might
[55:47] hear it in that still small voice but he
[55:50] will come and tell you you will not be
[55:52] destroyed I am I am I am the I am that
[55:56] met Moses in that burning bush I am the
[55:59] I am that went down and delivered the
[56:01] the children of Israel out of Egypt I am
[56:03] the I am that met Paul on the way to
[56:05] Damascus and I am the I am that was in
[56:08] that Pillar of Fire over William Miriam
[56:10] Branham and I am
[56:12] is here right now brothers and sisters
[56:15] and if we can just look at our
[56:16] situations through that Pillar of Fire
[56:19] isn't it wonderful that we were able to
[56:21] see that picture of the pillar of fire I
[56:24] remember the first time I saw it I
[56:25] thought it was a Halo and maybe it is
[56:28] and I remember watching cartoons when I
[56:30] was a little kid when when one of the
[56:32] characters would die it would be killed
[56:34] then he would just float up to heaven
[56:35] and go and sit on a cloud and he would
[56:37] have a Halo and it looked kind of like
[56:39] that Pillar of Fire so for me it was
[56:41] like man that makes perfect sense
[56:45] but it wasn't just so that we could
[56:47] start cartoons and and and be inspired
[56:50] to say that's what happens to us when we
[56:51] go to heaven and God is a good god and
[56:54] we can just get a Halo once we're we're
[56:56] good people and Christian folk that's
[56:58] not what it was about at all and the
[57:00] further I go with this the more I think
[57:02] my goodness how incredible is it to
[57:04] think that we had that visitation that
[57:06] we had that visible documentation
[57:09] God makes sure that Satan will Satan
[57:12] will be exposed but he makes sure that
[57:14] science will declare his life as well
[57:19] you know brothers and sisters today
[57:21] we're living under grace and we have it
[57:23] all isn't it wonderful to think that if
[57:26] we can look at at life through the
[57:29] pillar of fire and through the grace of
[57:31] God what do we have to fear what do we
[57:34] have to worry about there ain't no enemy
[57:36] there ain't no devil that can stand in
[57:37] your way
[57:39] he's going to try it but when you simply
[57:41] defy him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:43] Christ
[57:45] he's got no Authority none
[57:48] No Authority
[57:50] you know I was thinking about that that
[57:52] view that perspective from the pillar of
[57:54] fire many times in the mornings my life
[57:56] is totally different now which I'm sure
[57:58] everyone is well aware of I don't have a
[58:00] business I'm not jumping in my truck and
[58:02] and racing to go and Chase the the
[58:04] renovation world like we used to every
[58:07] morning before light usually or just at
[58:09] light you know driving down the road and
[58:12] witnessing the sunset or the sunrise
[58:14] from my vehicle and and now I I look at
[58:18] it I Marvel usually the family goes to
[58:20] school Lisa's driving the the children
[58:22] to school and I have that moment looking
[58:25] at the Sunrise and it's just beautiful
[58:27] we're in a position where we've got such
[58:29] a a tremendous view to the East and and
[58:32] anyways it's So Glorious and I just had
[58:35] this thought this week speaking about
[58:36] you know the perception of of the pillar
[58:38] of fire looking at it from a different
[58:40] perspective altogether and and it was
[58:42] just simply this that you know we see
[58:44] that glory for a few seconds maybe a
[58:47] minute if we're lucky right we get that
[58:49] just be beautiful intensely magnificent
[58:52] Sunrise before us or the beautiful
[58:55] sunset before us one or the other is
[58:58] happening right we get that once in a
[59:00] while in our lives and it's just
[59:01] magnificent but what I got this week was
[59:04] simply this that you know what that's
[59:06] happening every single second all around
[59:09] the world
[59:10] it's not just once or twice a day which
[59:13] is what I always just sort of thought
[59:14] about assumed about but As the World
[59:16] Turns it's happening every second that's
[59:19] how magnificent our God is he can dwell
[59:22] in any position that he wants to and so
[59:25] can we brothers and sisters if we allow
[59:27] ourselves to that's the god that we
[59:29] serve he's encompassing the entire Earth
[59:31] all at the same time What a Beautiful
[59:34] thought it is I believe it's just an
[59:36] opportunity for us to have just a little
[59:38] glimpse of what eternity is like all
[59:41] encompassing time doesn't matter because
[59:43] it's all encompassed it's all in one
[59:46] moment it's just such a beautiful
[59:48] thought
[59:50] where are we going today brother Barry
[59:52] we're just just trying to settle in
[59:55] just trying to get going here get some
[59:57] traction you know we're talking about
[59:59] strongholds last week and and the
[1:00:02] scripture in in second Corinthians 10. I
[1:00:05] believe it's a real important one I
[1:00:07] believe that something real important
[1:00:09] happened last week and I believe that
[1:00:11] every single time we come to church like
[1:00:13] this something really important can
[1:00:14] happen in our lives if we want it to and
[1:00:17] you know brothers and sisters it all
[1:00:18] comes down to what we want out of a
[1:00:21] service what do we want out of a service
[1:00:23] what we want out of a service will
[1:00:26] actually pay back to us in what we put
[1:00:28] into it and you know I'm not even saying
[1:00:31] what you do when you're here what's
[1:00:33] going on Saturday night brothers and
[1:00:35] sisters
[1:00:36] are we getting ready for service
[1:00:37] Saturday night are we getting ready for
[1:00:39] service Friday night Thursday night
[1:00:42] Wednesday are we praying for service on
[1:00:44] Sunday are we thinking about this stuff
[1:00:47] if we are then we're going to get
[1:00:49] something out of it
[1:00:51] the devil wants to have strongholds
[1:00:54] but we know
[1:00:55] even though we walk in the flesh we're
[1:00:58] not worrying after the flesh
[1:01:01] so brothers and sisters today I just
[1:01:02] want to I just want to say this and I'll
[1:01:05] probably say it a few times maybe I did
[1:01:06] last week but you know as long as it's
[1:01:08] anointed we just need to keep preaching
[1:01:10] it and I just want to say this if we
[1:01:12] have something in our bodies in our
[1:01:14] minds in our Spirits that's causing us
[1:01:16] to war after the flesh you're in the
[1:01:19] wrong position
[1:01:20] you're doing it wrong
[1:01:22] we're doing it wrong because we're not
[1:01:25] walking in the flesh even though we're
[1:01:26] in the flesh we're not warring after the
[1:01:28] flesh the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:01:32] carnal
[1:01:33] but when we get in the carnality
[1:01:36] we're going about it wrong and what
[1:01:38] we're doing what we do when that happens
[1:01:40] is we give Satan a day off give him an
[1:01:42] hour off give them a week off sometimes
[1:01:44] sometimes as human beings will even give
[1:01:47] Satan a decade off because we just get
[1:01:49] in the flesh over someone and we just
[1:01:51] can't get past it you know brothers and
[1:01:53] sisters who wants to give Satan time off
[1:01:56] we're not dealing we're not dealing with
[1:01:59] the flesh the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:02:01] not carnal I just love the next part of
[1:02:04] this scripture of second Corinthians
[1:02:06] chapter 4 chapter 10 verse 4. but our
[1:02:09] our weapons are mighty
[1:02:11] through God
[1:02:13] our weapons are Mighty through God
[1:02:16] to the pulling down of strongholds and
[1:02:20] those pulling down of strong holds
[1:02:22] aren't aren't the the Egyptians they're
[1:02:24] they're not the enemies the invites in
[1:02:27] the land they're devils they're devils
[1:02:29] in our land trying to get into our
[1:02:31] promised land and when we get into our
[1:02:33] Promised Land we're going to see devils
[1:02:35] and we're going to deal with them
[1:02:37] but it's a beautiful thing brothers and
[1:02:39] sisters because if we didn't have a
[1:02:40] struggle then Satan would have us
[1:02:42] if we're struggle and rejoice if you've
[1:02:45] got a struggle in your life clap your
[1:02:47] hands and Shout for Joy praise worship
[1:02:51] just like the redeemed would worship
[1:02:53] nobody in heaven can worship like the
[1:02:55] redeemed
[1:02:57] we have such an opportunity to do it
[1:02:59] here and remember we heard it said many
[1:03:01] times before you can look back at all of
[1:03:03] the times in the Bible and the and we
[1:03:05] read it in in in in Joshua the children
[1:03:08] of Israel coming out in The Exodus how
[1:03:10] many times did they win a battle every
[1:03:12] time except for one when there was sin
[1:03:14] in the camp but how did they win the
[1:03:16] battles God said just go out go to
[1:03:19] church in the morning and just array
[1:03:21] yourselves put yourselves in order
[1:03:23] follow all of the mechanics and when
[1:03:25] you're ready shout for Joy because then
[1:03:28] the Dynamics will come down and when the
[1:03:30] Dynamics comes down that's what takes
[1:03:32] the enemy out
[1:03:34] we want to take out strongholds brothers
[1:03:36] and sisters and as long as we're here in
[1:03:38] this flesh we're going to have strong
[1:03:40] holds in our lives and you know I've got
[1:03:43] them you've got them we've all got them
[1:03:45] but you know if we don't deal with them
[1:03:47] we're going to just make a provision for
[1:03:49] Satan to have his have his place in our
[1:03:53] lives I apologize for this this thing is
[1:03:56] problematic right now
[1:03:59] it's totally come apart on me
[1:04:02] oh boy we'll just go with it
[1:04:05] you know brothers and sisters we can say
[1:04:07] that we're in the Promised Land
[1:04:09] but if we're not careful
[1:04:11] this is what I want to get into today is
[1:04:13] that we can fortify instead of
[1:04:15] fortifying ourselves we can afford a
[1:04:17] fire enemy
[1:04:18] and it all comes down to what we feed on
[1:04:21] where do we spend our time
[1:04:25] you know brother brownie talks about the
[1:04:27] two dogs quarreling
[1:04:30] remember that story
[1:04:32] two dogs fighting he's talking to a
[1:04:34] Native American
[1:04:37] both these two dogs that fight and he
[1:04:39] says which dog wins
[1:04:42] and and the Indian the Native American
[1:04:44] tells them
[1:04:45] the one that he feeds the most
[1:04:48] the one that gets the protein
[1:04:50] and the bones
[1:04:52] and the cherries
[1:04:54] and the pits
[1:04:55] the one that gets it all
[1:04:57] he's the one that's going to win
[1:04:59] and you know that wasn't about the story
[1:05:01] about two dogs quarreling that was a a
[1:05:03] word stored up for someone in a certain
[1:05:06] day at a certain time in a certain
[1:05:09] season that was stored up food for a
[1:05:12] certain individual and I would say that
[1:05:14] would be me because I want to take it I
[1:05:16] want to say be done to me according to
[1:05:18] that word
[1:05:19] the two dogs quarreling which one wins
[1:05:21] whichever dogs
[1:05:23] gets fed the most
[1:05:26] you know what happens as human beings
[1:05:28] brothers and sisters guilty right here
[1:05:31] guilty of feeding the wrong dog
[1:05:35] and Satan is subtle
[1:05:37] he's the most subtle beast of the field
[1:05:40] that has never changed from the Garden
[1:05:41] of Eden Brothers and Sisters he'll come
[1:05:44] as a polished Slicker brother Bradham
[1:05:46] said
[1:05:47] look into defile whoever he can and we
[1:05:50] know we've worded or quoted it many
[1:05:53] times he says a roaring lion seeking
[1:05:56] whom he may devour but we know that he's
[1:05:58] got no teeth that's what brother Branham
[1:06:00] said he's got no teeth but still it's
[1:06:02] kind of scary but if we're feeding the
[1:06:05] wrong dog then that dog is going to be
[1:06:07] the one that has power so let's just
[1:06:09] take that word dog out and say devil
[1:06:12] let's say spirit because we're either
[1:06:14] going to feed the Holy Spirit or we're
[1:06:16] going to feed the devil we're going to
[1:06:18] feed another spirit
[1:06:20] the Holy Spirit or another Spirit that's
[1:06:23] what's going to happen in our lives
[1:06:27] you know if we listen say Amen if we
[1:06:29] read Say Amen
[1:06:31] sing and shout and say amen and we just
[1:06:34] have the victory man we just have it
[1:06:36] like it's just on top of the world when
[1:06:39] we leave a service I guarantee you Satan
[1:06:43] is going to be sitting outside in the
[1:06:45] parking lot he ain't gonna wait till you
[1:06:47] get home he's going to be in the parking
[1:06:48] lot and there's going to be a text
[1:06:50] message there's going to be an update
[1:06:51] there's going to be another video
[1:06:53] dropped by someone something is going to
[1:06:56] be there to get our distraction our
[1:06:57] attention and it's going to get us but
[1:07:00] if we don't look at it he's not going to
[1:07:02] have any power over us
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:08] we can come and have the greatest
[1:07:09] victory in a service
[1:07:12] and then feed on anything inspired by
[1:07:16] Satan
[1:07:17] what happens
[1:07:19] is we forfeit the victory that we just
[1:07:20] got
[1:07:22] and there's make no mistake about it
[1:07:23] brothers and sisters there's Victory
[1:07:25] right here in this service we have seen
[1:07:28] them we have witness stuff we Are
[1:07:30] Witnesses of the victory of Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] today on Earth
[1:07:35] but Satan doesn't want us to have that
[1:07:37] Victory he wants to try and kick us he
[1:07:39] wants to try and make us feel condemned
[1:07:40] he wants us to have iniquity
[1:07:43] remember the word says because
[1:07:46] of iniquity
[1:07:49] the love of many
[1:07:51] shall wax cold
[1:07:53] so if we're waxing cold brothers and
[1:07:55] sisters what's going on
[1:07:56] it's the word of God
[1:07:58] but many times I feel like we can
[1:08:00] forfeit our Victory and I'm speaking
[1:08:02] from my own experience here and I just
[1:08:05] feel that's the only place that I can
[1:08:06] really preach from and I hope that it's
[1:08:08] somehow an inspiration we can forfeit
[1:08:11] our Victory by just feeding on the wrong
[1:08:14] thing by looking at the wrong thing
[1:08:16] remember Vex a lot vexed his righteous
[1:08:21] soul that righteous man the word says
[1:08:23] vexed his righteous Soul daily
[1:08:26] with what he saw and what he heard
[1:08:29] and what did he see and what did he hear
[1:08:30] brothers and sisters no doubt it was
[1:08:32] probably really polished it probably
[1:08:34] wasn't wasn't raging awful stuff
[1:08:38] he might have had
[1:08:40] just a a YouTube account
[1:08:42] he might have had a Facebook account
[1:08:45] he might have had some sort of other
[1:08:46] account some sort of other thing going
[1:08:49] on maybe he had a video game
[1:08:52] he had something that was controlling
[1:08:54] his time that was sucking his his mind
[1:08:58] power
[1:08:59] something was distracting him to Vex his
[1:09:02] righteous soul and you know it was it
[1:09:05] was appointed it was anointed for his
[1:09:07] day and make no mistake about it Satan
[1:09:09] is going to take everything and train it
[1:09:11] to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's going
[1:09:13] to take the jingliest thing the shiniest
[1:09:15] thing and try and get our attention with
[1:09:17] it brothers and sisters
[1:09:19] so if it's I just want to say it this
[1:09:21] way if it's inspired by God it's going
[1:09:23] to be about the word
[1:09:25] if it's not about the word I don't know
[1:09:27] I'll let you make that decision I would
[1:09:29] say ask the Holy Ghost in you what he
[1:09:32] says about that thing and see if he
[1:09:35] agrees with it and if he agrees with it
[1:09:37] then go for it but if he doesn't agree
[1:09:39] with it that's his grace to you for this
[1:09:42] day
[1:09:43] that's him saying to you just get in the
[1:09:46] boat
[1:09:47] just like Noah just get in the boat
[1:09:49] that's all you got to do is just put
[1:09:51] that thing away stop looking at that
[1:09:53] don't do that anymore and what will
[1:09:55] happen is you'll start to feed the right
[1:09:57] dog and then suddenly you'll have that
[1:09:59] strength in the moment where you don't
[1:10:01] you'll say man I wasn't even praying
[1:10:03] this morning
[1:10:05] I didn't even pray before I left the
[1:10:07] house today and and this thing that used
[1:10:08] to tempt me all the time now I'm seeing
[1:10:10] it bold-faced and it doesn't have any
[1:10:13] power over me how does that work
[1:10:16] because you're preparing you weren't
[1:10:18] feeding at the wrong Source but boy if
[1:10:20] you were feeding at the wrong source
[1:10:21] that Temptation comes up oh my it's a
[1:10:24] stumbling block you're just gonna trip
[1:10:26] and fall and then you've got iniquity
[1:10:27] and then you start to cycle over and
[1:10:29] over again if you ever wonder about this
[1:10:31] listen to why are people so tossed about
[1:10:33] brother Branham has two messages like
[1:10:35] that why are they so tossed about I
[1:10:37] would say it goes just like that with
[1:10:39] doors indoor brother Bradham preaches
[1:10:42] that in 1965 the only reason is because
[1:10:44] there's one's place in people's lives
[1:10:47] where they won't let him in
[1:10:49] they'll say you can go through anywhere
[1:10:51] in my house brother random talks about
[1:10:53] it you can come into my house just come
[1:10:54] into my house we we're so welcome to
[1:10:57] have you there he talks about what a
[1:10:59] pharaoh were to come by your house
[1:11:00] Pharaoh was going to say why I'd just
[1:11:02] like to come by your house and have a
[1:11:03] visit
[1:11:04] you'd be like wow honey we've got to
[1:11:06] dust the house we've got to clean the
[1:11:08] yard we gotta do everything clean the
[1:11:10] windows make it look great because
[1:11:11] Pharaoh's coming here and he talks about
[1:11:13] Adolf Hitler and just about how powerful
[1:11:16] these men were what if he came to the
[1:11:18] house and if it was a Nazi Soldier he
[1:11:20] would be like my goodness it's the
[1:11:21] viewer he's coming we need to make sure
[1:11:23] we have everything in order
[1:11:26] but what about God he says what about
[1:11:28] God when Jesus comes to our house
[1:11:32] what about Jesus when he comes to visit
[1:11:34] what do we do do we say welcome
[1:11:37] come on in
[1:11:39] we know he's talking about our house our
[1:11:41] house being our heart it's not our
[1:11:43] literal home but he uses a literal home
[1:11:45] as the example we can have the foyer set
[1:11:48] up just beautifully and take all of our
[1:11:49] trash and stuff it into the rooms and
[1:11:52] say you can come into the foyer that's
[1:11:53] as far as you can go
[1:11:55] or you can say no you're welcome to just
[1:11:57] go anywhere you want to go
[1:12:00] brother Branham talks about this and as
[1:12:02] he goes through the the message indoors
[1:12:04] and Dory talks about it in one place he
[1:12:06] says you know can I open just one more
[1:12:08] door I just love the way he preaches it
[1:12:11] he says can I just open one more door
[1:12:12] and he he actually opens I think three
[1:12:14] more doors after he says one more door
[1:12:16] but it's just a preacher's way of saying
[1:12:19] the service is going to end sometime I
[1:12:21] I'm gonna close soon you know and you
[1:12:23] have 20 minutes every time you say that
[1:12:25] sort of but he he says could I just go
[1:12:28] in one more door and he says this is the
[1:12:30] one that counts the most brothers and
[1:12:32] sisters I believe my personal life
[1:12:34] oh don't go there don't don't talk about
[1:12:37] my personal life brothers and sisters
[1:12:40] that's where we're going let's talk
[1:12:41] about our personal life because we
[1:12:43] should be the exact same person here
[1:12:45] that we are at home or in the grocery
[1:12:48] store or or wherever it is we go if
[1:12:51] we're not that same person or something
[1:12:53] wrong with our experience and we need to
[1:12:54] get back to the altar we need to get on
[1:12:57] the horns of the Altar and cry out to
[1:12:58] God for the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:02] we cannot behave the same way
[1:13:04] differently
[1:13:06] we have to behave the same way
[1:13:08] we have to be the same
[1:13:10] if we're feeding on something inspired
[1:13:12] by Satan that's going to cause us to
[1:13:13] behave differently for the brown amount
[1:13:15] of questions and answers number four
[1:13:17] 1964 he says somebody he somebody
[1:13:22] he had one one time
[1:13:25] he had one one time was converted
[1:13:29] received the Holy Ghost
[1:13:31] and he said to him
[1:13:33] how are you getting along
[1:13:36] and and he said pretty good and pretty
[1:13:38] bad
[1:13:41] oh my
[1:13:43] I don't think I can do this
[1:13:45] I just have to get this off bear with me
[1:13:48] all right I don't take my jacket off
[1:13:50] very much
[1:13:52] it's a good time it's a good opportunity
[1:13:54] for it
[1:13:56] this is uh not doing well for me today I
[1:13:59] apologize
[1:14:01] are we okay
[1:14:03] somebody told me he had one one time was
[1:14:05] converted received the Holy Ghost and he
[1:14:07] said to him how are you getting along
[1:14:11] he said pretty good and pretty bad and
[1:14:12] remember this is someone who got the
[1:14:14] Holy Ghost
[1:14:15] not just some random guy
[1:14:18] that's why I think this is important he
[1:14:20] said pretty pretty good and pretty bad
[1:14:22] he said well how how do you mean pretty
[1:14:24] bad and pretty good he said well since
[1:14:27] me received the Holy Ghost he said
[1:14:29] there's been two dogs in me and one of
[1:14:31] them a black dog and one of them a white
[1:14:33] dog and said they argue all the time
[1:14:36] said they growl and fight
[1:14:39] at one another
[1:14:40] and said the white dog wants me to do
[1:14:42] good the black dog wants me to do bad
[1:14:45] said well Chief which one of them wins
[1:14:47] the fight
[1:14:49] said that depends on which one Chief
[1:14:53] feeds the most
[1:14:55] so I think that's a good answer here see
[1:14:59] there just depends on the warring of the
[1:15:01] body that's in you
[1:15:04] he takes it from being just a
[1:15:06] hypothetical thing out there
[1:15:08] to write down inside you right down home
[1:15:12] I think that's a good answer here see
[1:15:15] there just depends on the warring of the
[1:15:17] body that's in you it depends on which
[1:15:19] one you cater to
[1:15:21] which nature you cater to
[1:15:25] the carnal nature
[1:15:28] after the things of the world
[1:15:31] or spiritual nature after the things of
[1:15:34] God that does it
[1:15:36] I'm just going to say that last part
[1:15:38] there
[1:15:39] depends on the warring of the body
[1:15:41] that's in you it depends on which one
[1:15:43] you cater to
[1:15:45] which nature you cater to the carnal
[1:15:49] nature after the things of the world
[1:15:52] or the spiritual nature after the things
[1:15:54] of God that does it where do we live
[1:15:57] brothers and sisters what what what one
[1:15:59] are we feeding in our lives
[1:16:01] because that's going to dictate the
[1:16:03] ability for us to be able to overcome in
[1:16:06] our day and you know we know we've
[1:16:08] already overcome but the only thing
[1:16:10] that's going to happen to us is we're
[1:16:11] just going to have a few extra bumps
[1:16:13] along the way because God's going to
[1:16:15] shake all of that carnality out of our
[1:16:17] lives he won't allow it to actually make
[1:16:19] its way there and that's why brother
[1:16:20] Branham talked about that's why God
[1:16:22] talked to us through brother Branham
[1:16:24] about the railroad company the railroad
[1:16:27] company will not put the seal on the
[1:16:28] door if it's not packed properly because
[1:16:30] that railroad company is going to be
[1:16:32] responsible for all the goods inside
[1:16:34] that's why God will not put his seal
[1:16:36] upon the human being until that person
[1:16:39] is willing to go right down to the
[1:16:41] foundation have that contrite spirit and
[1:16:43] actually make that relationship with God
[1:16:46] the solid foundation to start with and
[1:16:49] then go forwards and you know sometimes
[1:16:50] brothers and sisters it takes a little
[1:16:52] bit of dusting off sometimes we've got
[1:16:54] to go back and dig up sometimes we've
[1:16:56] got to get an excavator a giant loader
[1:16:58] in there something that they would have
[1:17:00] at a mine to clear all of the garbage in
[1:17:03] our life out of the way all the things
[1:17:04] that have piled on top of that one thing
[1:17:06] but once we get down to the foundation
[1:17:08] we can get that relationship with God
[1:17:10] right again once we do that
[1:17:16] you'll never have to say everybody raise
[1:17:18] your hands and now we're going to sing
[1:17:20] can we sing a little louder doesn't the
[1:17:22] music inspire you
[1:17:24] can I get an amen that's not going to
[1:17:26] happen because people are going to
[1:17:27] recognize the grace of God in their
[1:17:29] lives
[1:17:31] if you've had the new birth and you've
[1:17:32] been born again by the Holy Ghost the
[1:17:34] Holy Ghost will not feed on the things
[1:17:37] of the world the Holy Ghost will not
[1:17:39] feed on the things of the world brothers
[1:17:40] and sisters you will not be able to
[1:17:43] serve God and Mammon at the same time
[1:17:45] that's what the word of God says that's
[1:17:46] what Jesus said he you will not be able
[1:17:49] to serve God and Mammon so whatever it
[1:17:51] is that we have as a as a time-consuming
[1:17:54] thing in our lives I just want to say it
[1:17:55] brothers and sisters is it of God or is
[1:17:58] it of the world because we can say that
[1:18:01] oh it's just of the world it's just of
[1:18:03] the world it's not of Satan remember
[1:18:05] what brother Branham said civilization
[1:18:07] is of Satan civilization is of the devil
[1:18:11] in our lives today he's going to come
[1:18:13] around as the most subtle beast of the
[1:18:15] field he's not going to come around as a
[1:18:17] great raging monster in front of us
[1:18:21] he's smarter than that he knows the
[1:18:22] Bride of Jesus Christ he just needs to
[1:18:24] be distracted so long as she's
[1:18:25] distracted she forgets who she is she
[1:18:27] forgets that she is literally the life
[1:18:29] of Jesus Christ on Earth in her day
[1:18:33] so long as she's distracted and doesn't
[1:18:35] recognize that he's got all the time in
[1:18:37] the world he knows that his time is
[1:18:39] short and then when the bride recognizes
[1:18:40] that when she comes to that realization
[1:18:42] she goes up and he comes down remember
[1:18:45] brother Branham said it when she
[1:18:47] recognizes when when it recognizes what
[1:18:50] it is then the Rapture will go oh you
[1:18:52] say no it ain't he says oh but yes it
[1:18:54] will yes it is that's the truth it's
[1:18:56] going to happen that way
[1:18:58] you won't be able to serve God and
[1:19:00] Mammon at the same time trying to serve
[1:19:02] two masters will drive a person mad
[1:19:07] if we're trying to serve two masters
[1:19:08] brothers and sisters what's going to
[1:19:10] happen we're going to have that wolf
[1:19:11] nature brother Branham talks about that
[1:19:13] dove in our life is just going to fly
[1:19:15] away and just allow that that that that
[1:19:17] dark dog in the fight that that call it
[1:19:21] other Spirit to manifest in our lives
[1:19:24] and that other spirit is going to have
[1:19:26] that wolf nature and he's going to growl
[1:19:28] and snap and bark because a person is
[1:19:31] trying to serve two masters you can't do
[1:19:33] that
[1:19:34] you can only serve one master at a time
[1:19:37] and you know when people are so tossed
[1:19:39] about it's because they're trying to
[1:19:40] serve two masters they really want to
[1:19:42] serve god brother Branham talks about it
[1:19:44] we'll probably read it quote in a little
[1:19:45] bit brother Branham says that there's
[1:19:46] two classes of Believers and then he
[1:19:48] correct corrects himself very quickly
[1:19:50] after that and says I correct myself
[1:19:51] there's not two classes of Believers I'm
[1:19:54] sorry there's actually two phases but I
[1:19:56] think it's important to recognize that
[1:19:58] there's a separation between the two one
[1:20:01] of them is carnal he says that's the
[1:20:04] difference carnal head knowledge it's
[1:20:06] all about what I know I I know the
[1:20:09] quotes I I understand the message of the
[1:20:11] hour I understand the Bible I can quote
[1:20:13] scripture after scripture but the
[1:20:16] dynamic power just ain't there why not
[1:20:18] because it's just carnal
[1:20:21] but boy oh boy when it makes that move
[1:20:23] from the Mind Into the Heart
[1:20:26] it changes things
[1:20:30] remember a double-minded man is unstable
[1:20:32] in all of his ways
[1:20:36] you never want to get that reputation do
[1:20:38] you
[1:20:39] could be that person that will just flip
[1:20:42] you just don't know when that person is
[1:20:44] going to flip you know that there's two
[1:20:46] people there and you just don't
[1:20:47] understand when or where it could happen
[1:20:49] how it could trigger the reason it
[1:20:52] happens brothers and sisters is because
[1:20:54] someone's a double-minded person they're
[1:20:56] serving two masters at the same time and
[1:20:58] it makes them mad that's the word of God
[1:21:00] if you're serving two masters it will
[1:21:03] make you mad that's the word of God you
[1:21:06] can't escape that we can't escape it and
[1:21:08] I want to tell you brothers and sisters
[1:21:10] from experience it made me mad
[1:21:12] but thanks be to God for a pastor that
[1:21:15] would go on his knees and pray for the
[1:21:17] sheep that would just ask God to show
[1:21:19] someone a revelation about themselves
[1:21:21] because in doing so it delivered me I
[1:21:24] believe it delivered me I believe it
[1:21:26] showed me that I can't serve two masters
[1:21:28] I need to serve one and one only and by
[1:21:31] doing that it gives me the strength to
[1:21:33] overcome when I need it
[1:21:35] amen because brothers and sisters you
[1:21:37] know I thought for the longest time in
[1:21:39] my life that I need to be able to know
[1:21:41] the scripture so that I can just say
[1:21:43] when Satan comes around like a roaring
[1:21:45] lion I could just pull the sword of the
[1:21:47] of the word and and just stand and face
[1:21:50] Satan when he comes to me and be able to
[1:21:52] quote a scripture and be able to quote a
[1:21:53] scripture and be able to quote a
[1:21:54] scripture and be able to get rid of him
[1:21:56] and that will do him in and it will we
[1:21:58] know that's how Jesus defeated Satan but
[1:22:01] I believe it goes further than that
[1:22:02] brothers and sisters it goes much
[1:22:04] further than that that's where the
[1:22:06] denominational World lives we don't live
[1:22:08] in the denominational World remember I
[1:22:10] talked about it from the beginning
[1:22:11] pulling down strong holds in our lives
[1:22:14] and recognizing that we're not living in
[1:22:16] the carnal flesh we're we're living in
[1:22:19] the pillar of fire we should be looking
[1:22:21] at this world thinking there's no
[1:22:22] problem that's going to destroy us
[1:22:24] nothing can harm us
[1:22:26] sorry brother Daniel if I spit on you I
[1:22:28] really honestly don't mean to
[1:22:31] forgive me brother
[1:22:34] maybe one day I'll have to chew your gum
[1:22:35] for that
[1:22:37] we can't serve two masters at the same
[1:22:40] time it will drive us mad
[1:22:43] remember out of uh questions and answers
[1:22:45] Allah having a shadow 1954.
[1:22:48] Christian friend
[1:22:50] brother Branham says this a person
[1:22:52] cannot be born again till they receive
[1:22:54] the Holy Spirit
[1:22:57] and that's why I just harp on it I can't
[1:22:58] stop harping on it brothers and sisters
[1:23:00] it's the same importance just as it was
[1:23:02] for Noah and his day to get in the boat
[1:23:03] if we don't get the Holy Spirit In Our
[1:23:05] Lives then what we're doing is spinning
[1:23:07] our Wheels we're we're we're living in
[1:23:10] existence that's going to make us mad
[1:23:11] it's going to make us miserable you have
[1:23:13] to get the Holy Ghost in your life once
[1:23:15] you do get the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:23:17] brothers and sisters it's going to give
[1:23:19] you the ability to say Amen to every
[1:23:21] single word and what happens is you
[1:23:23] won't want to feed on the things of the
[1:23:25] world you won't want to feed on the
[1:23:27] carnality of this life you will want to
[1:23:29] feed on the word of God and the more
[1:23:31] that you feed on the word of God the
[1:23:33] more overcoming you're going to have in
[1:23:35] your life and the overcoming that you're
[1:23:37] going to have in your life is going to
[1:23:38] be from what you fed on yesterday and
[1:23:41] the day before and the day before those
[1:23:43] prayers then are going to be what
[1:23:45] rescues you today it's not going to be a
[1:23:47] prayer in the moment maybe it will be
[1:23:49] but remember brothers and sisters when
[1:23:51] life happens when you go through an
[1:23:52] intersection on a green light and you
[1:23:54] think that it's all fine and good and
[1:23:56] somebody comes and hits your vehicle and
[1:23:58] now you're caught between Heaven and
[1:23:59] Earth have you got the time to pray
[1:24:03] I remember going back to the hospital
[1:24:05] and the comment that came out in the
[1:24:06] truck with brother Ken that day was oh
[1:24:09] my there's times where you're sure glad
[1:24:11] your praying is already done because
[1:24:12] when you have something happen in your
[1:24:14] life it's too late
[1:24:19] you can't be born again until you
[1:24:21] receive the holy spirit so you can't
[1:24:24] you're not even converted until you
[1:24:26] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:24:28] remember Jesus
[1:24:30] he told Peter feed my sheep do you love
[1:24:32] me Peter after everything that had
[1:24:35] happened he told them that you'll deny
[1:24:37] me three times before the crows
[1:24:40] no he'll never do that cut off the
[1:24:42] servants here so full of
[1:24:44] vigor
[1:24:46] I'm Gonna Save you you're not gonna die
[1:24:48] remember even having supper nobody will
[1:24:50] kill you I won't let them how bold he
[1:24:52] was how Brazen he was how on fire he was
[1:24:55] for the word in his day
[1:24:57] and what did he say to him he said get
[1:24:59] thee behind me Satan
[1:25:01] because it behooves us to fulfill all
[1:25:03] scripture
[1:25:04] the word has to be fulfilled and he had
[1:25:06] to go to Calvary but afterwards when he
[1:25:09] had risen and he had been around for
[1:25:11] about 40 days and and he said to him
[1:25:13] Peter do you love me oh yes Lord I love
[1:25:15] you feed my sheep Peter
[1:25:18] feed my sheep Peter don't don't don't
[1:25:20] get caught up in the isms in this world
[1:25:22] just feed my sheep Peter and we know
[1:25:25] that there came a time even when he was
[1:25:27] telling him that that he wasn't
[1:25:29] converted yet was he
[1:25:31] Peter was on the shore he saw Jesus
[1:25:34] risen from the dead Jesus fed them one
[1:25:37] more time fish and bread baked by a fire
[1:25:41] he was the one that jumped out of the
[1:25:43] boat to go and meet him
[1:25:45] so full of vigor but he still wasn't
[1:25:48] converted
[1:25:49] he needed to actually have a conversion
[1:25:51] and we know that every single person has
[1:25:53] to have that Upper Room experience they
[1:25:56] have got to go in that upper room and be
[1:25:58] just like every one of them even Mary
[1:26:00] his own mother had to have that Upper
[1:26:02] Room experience and brother Branham said
[1:26:04] that clearly that's where the the
[1:26:05] Catholics kind of went a little bit off
[1:26:07] maybe a lot off depending on who you're
[1:26:09] talking to or what you're looking at but
[1:26:11] but Mary was just like everyone else
[1:26:13] even though she was his mother she had
[1:26:15] to have that Upper Room experience and
[1:26:17] every one of us has to have that Upper
[1:26:19] Room experience you you are not even
[1:26:21] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:26:24] Ghost I'm not say you're lost before you
[1:26:26] receive the Holy Ghost because you're
[1:26:28] not is what brother Branham says you're
[1:26:30] not lost it's one of those phases of
[1:26:32] Christianity that brother Branham was
[1:26:34] talking about your your your your either
[1:26:38] carnally looking at things or or you're
[1:26:40] looking at it spiritually brother random
[1:26:42] talks about it and why people are so
[1:26:44] tossed about the person who has carnal
[1:26:46] they're up and they're down and they're
[1:26:47] up and they're down they're still safe
[1:26:49] left somewhere throughout eternity
[1:26:51] they'll be saved maybe at the white
[1:26:53] Throne Maybe not maybe call them unwise
[1:26:56] virgin maybe not we would never want to
[1:26:58] put anybody in a category we want
[1:27:00] everybody to be saved as the Bride of
[1:27:02] Jesus Christ but we know that's not the
[1:27:04] reality
[1:27:05] we know that election has to stand but
[1:27:07] it's not up to us to determine who is
[1:27:09] elect and who is not that's up to God
[1:27:12] the only thing we need to do is preach
[1:27:14] this word and let the word do this
[1:27:16] sorting
[1:27:20] I just want to take a moment and say
[1:27:23] again talk about myself
[1:27:25] in front of everyone
[1:27:27] goodness
[1:27:29] it only can be real unless I experience
[1:27:32] it I guess
[1:27:36] I do want to apologize last week I think
[1:27:38] I came all maybe pretty hard about
[1:27:40] Facebook
[1:27:42] you know there's things in this world
[1:27:43] that we can be a part of and do
[1:27:46] that inherently aren't bad
[1:27:48] it's just what we allow them to turn
[1:27:50] into
[1:27:51] but I promise that Satan has created
[1:27:54] these things through men
[1:27:56] Satan has inspired men to create things
[1:27:58] for a purpose
[1:28:00] and that purpose is either to serve God
[1:28:02] or to serve the devil it's one of the
[1:28:03] other brothers and sisters that's it but
[1:28:06] we can use technology we can use phones
[1:28:09] we can use internet all for the glory of
[1:28:11] God
[1:28:12] but it's a very fine balance
[1:28:15] and although I came out hard about
[1:28:17] Facebook last week I just want to
[1:28:18] apologize not because anybody from
[1:28:20] Facebook called me
[1:28:24] I don't think I'm that important and I
[1:28:26] never would want to be but just for the
[1:28:28] simple fact is I don't ever want to tell
[1:28:30] anybody what to do I just want to say
[1:28:32] get the Holy Ghost and let him the
[1:28:34] spirit of Truth lead you and guide you
[1:28:36] into all truth let him give you the
[1:28:38] direction that you want to go in your
[1:28:40] life
[1:28:42] after service my wife and I we both
[1:28:45] deleted our account our Facebook
[1:28:47] accounts and you know
[1:28:50] I didn't really think it was that big a
[1:28:52] deal myself I know that it was consuming
[1:28:54] me but I didn't really think maybe I
[1:28:56] would need to delete it but I thought
[1:28:58] you know I don't I don't mind I it's not
[1:29:00] going to hold me I'm not going to say I
[1:29:02] have to have it if I just don't have it
[1:29:05] I have to have it to be able to
[1:29:07] demonstrate that I can overcome no no no
[1:29:09] no no no no no no I'll just say I don't
[1:29:12] need it it's that simple and and you
[1:29:14] know I've done that with a few different
[1:29:15] things in my life over time
[1:29:18] and I'll just give you an example
[1:29:20] brothers and sisters that it's such a
[1:29:23] it's just the devil
[1:29:25] if he can't get you on one front he'll
[1:29:27] get you on another
[1:29:29] he don't care what ditch you go into so
[1:29:31] long as you go into a ditch man he's
[1:29:33] going to push you one way or the other
[1:29:35] he'll push you or he'll pull you or
[1:29:38] he'll pull pull pull and then he'll just
[1:29:40] let go while you're pulling backwards
[1:29:42] and then you'll go that's why we need to
[1:29:44] know exactly what our footing is where
[1:29:46] we stand
[1:29:47] but you know I got rid of Facebook and
[1:29:50] some of the stuff that was popping up in
[1:29:52] the reels the short videos for me this
[1:29:54] is just me
[1:29:56] was music some of the old-fashioned
[1:29:58] music that I was into and I wasn't
[1:30:01] watching it streaming it saying you know
[1:30:04] whatever I would just see it there and
[1:30:06] I'd be like oh what's that song yeah I
[1:30:07] remember that song I used to play that
[1:30:09] game I don't know if anybody understands
[1:30:10] that there used to be a game a trivia
[1:30:12] game for music and I used to play it a
[1:30:15] lot
[1:30:15] and and so the the the the song that's
[1:30:18] playing is always something that I'm
[1:30:20] thinking about oh what song is that oh
[1:30:22] what song is that oh what song is that I
[1:30:23] bet I know it I better know it and you
[1:30:25] know fortunately I don't know the songs
[1:30:26] now that much but somehow Facebook got a
[1:30:29] hold
[1:30:30] whatever inspiration it is of some of
[1:30:33] that music that I used to listen to and
[1:30:35] started to send these things my way and
[1:30:37] I guess it's the algorithms if you click
[1:30:39] on it for a second it will actually
[1:30:40] capture that and then it will actually
[1:30:42] start to send you more and so here I
[1:30:45] find myself in this situation I'm
[1:30:46] thinking about this stuff I don't want
[1:30:48] to think about this stuff what am I
[1:30:49] thinking about this stuff for it's only
[1:30:51] because I looked at it what I'm doing is
[1:30:53] vexing my righteous soul with the things
[1:30:55] that I'm looking at and the things that
[1:30:57] I'm hearing
[1:30:59] so we delete it that's fine it's gone
[1:31:01] good praise the Lord
[1:31:04] I've got a victory there and you know it
[1:31:06] feels good
[1:31:08] feels good to think that you're taking a
[1:31:09] step by faith brothers and sisters if
[1:31:12] you haven't done it for a while or
[1:31:13] you've never done it I recommend trying
[1:31:15] it with something if something is in
[1:31:17] your life that you just think maybe you
[1:31:20] think you need
[1:31:21] check it out see if you really need it
[1:31:23] and see if you can just set it down and
[1:31:25] leave it alone
[1:31:27] we're going to talk about this a little
[1:31:28] further but you know just talking about
[1:31:30] myself here so what happened was I I use
[1:31:33] YouTube I use YouTube but I know they're
[1:31:36] linked now and everything is all one
[1:31:38] thing it's all working off of the same
[1:31:40] inspiration but what happens in YouTube
[1:31:42] suddenly I start getting all these
[1:31:45] things that was coming through on
[1:31:47] Facebook that I got rid of now it's
[1:31:48] filtering through on YouTube I'm like
[1:31:51] what is this
[1:31:53] here we go
[1:31:55] you know what I say YouTube and I will
[1:31:57] say this YouTube is very useful it's
[1:32:00] helped me fix Vehicles it's helped me
[1:32:02] fix appliances it's helped me build
[1:32:04] things it's helped me create things it's
[1:32:07] helped me with many different things we
[1:32:08] use YouTube to actually stream Services
[1:32:10] we use YouTube to Archive Services
[1:32:13] YouTube is a useful thing
[1:32:16] but not if you just don't use it
[1:32:18] properly
[1:32:20] and so what I found myself doing was not
[1:32:23] using it properly but you know really
[1:32:26] it's the inspiration that's behind it
[1:32:28] but I'm to the point where I'm prepared
[1:32:30] because I'm here I don't need to have
[1:32:33] YouTube in my phone in my life I don't
[1:32:36] need to have it really I suppose if I
[1:32:38] need to find YouTube I can look it up
[1:32:40] somewhere and go and look at a video but
[1:32:43] I don't have to have an update coming
[1:32:44] through all the time showing me that
[1:32:46] this thing is happening
[1:32:49] that's the devil though that's the
[1:32:51] inspiration let's try and keep everyone
[1:32:53] busy and keep them Afflicted keep them
[1:32:56] vexing their righteous Souls with the
[1:32:58] things that they see daily the sea and
[1:33:01] here
[1:33:02] but really what's what's getting our
[1:33:03] attention brothers and sisters this is
[1:33:04] what I want to get to I think you for me
[1:33:06] it's interesting because what's getting
[1:33:08] my attention these days is the screen
[1:33:10] time I'll say it openly it's my phone
[1:33:12] and the screen time and you know what I
[1:33:13] want to do is really kind of flush it
[1:33:15] down the toilet take it and drive over
[1:33:16] it with my truck maybe set it up in the
[1:33:18] backyard and shoot it with a shotgun
[1:33:20] forget about the television take the
[1:33:22] phone out and get rid of it but you know
[1:33:24] the way this world is set up is that we
[1:33:26] need them
[1:33:27] we have to have a phone to communicate
[1:33:29] so do you just get an analog phone that
[1:33:32] you can just dial numbers on maybe maybe
[1:33:33] some people need to go that far if you
[1:33:36] do God bless you
[1:33:39] I'm not going to judge anyone I wouldn't
[1:33:40] want to judge anyone
[1:33:42] only talking about my experience here
[1:33:44] but what consumes most of our time we're
[1:33:46] either feeding on the word or we're
[1:33:48] feeding on the world
[1:33:50] Matthew 24 and because iniquity shall
[1:33:52] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:33:54] you know I just think possessing our
[1:33:57] Promised Land possessing our inheritance
[1:33:59] brothers and sisters there's a little
[1:34:01] little thing that I remember brother Ken
[1:34:02] talked about one time and he talked
[1:34:04] about how the world has things out of
[1:34:06] order completely out of order the way
[1:34:08] the the world has things set up is that
[1:34:10] the children are number one the children
[1:34:12] are the ultimate in the family and and
[1:34:15] the wives are second in the family and
[1:34:18] the husband is third and and basically
[1:34:20] last in the world in the families and
[1:34:23] then Christ would be after the husband
[1:34:25] but that's the way the world has things
[1:34:27] set up and that's what Satan wants us to
[1:34:30] believe that's the way he wants us to
[1:34:31] live our lives but we know that it's
[1:34:33] Christ first in our lives right brothers
[1:34:35] and sisters it's Christ first then the
[1:34:38] husband then the wives then the children
[1:34:40] then the church
[1:34:42] I'm going to say that and that might be
[1:34:44] a little shocking but brothers and
[1:34:46] sisters we've got to be looking after
[1:34:47] our own Families First
[1:34:49] it's not up to the pastor to be a parent
[1:34:52] to someone's children although the
[1:34:53] pastor will certainly help the pastor
[1:34:55] will certainly encourage the pastor will
[1:34:57] be the one to be there for us when we
[1:35:00] need help
[1:35:01] but it's not the pastor's job to raise
[1:35:03] children
[1:35:05] it's not the church's job to raise
[1:35:07] children
[1:35:09] but you know in our in our families in
[1:35:11] our homes brothers and sisters I just
[1:35:13] want to throw this out there and I'm
[1:35:14] certainly open to discussion about it
[1:35:16] but just from my own perspective I
[1:35:18] started to think what would my
[1:35:19] priorities be if I had to prioritize
[1:35:21] what would I want to see them to be in
[1:35:23] my promised land with my family
[1:35:26] and I would probably try and encourage
[1:35:28] anyone who would be listening now to
[1:35:29] think about this that it should be
[1:35:31] Christ first
[1:35:32] number one in your life should be Christ
[1:35:35] number two should be your family
[1:35:38] number three
[1:35:40] your job
[1:35:41] because you got to provide for your
[1:35:43] family
[1:35:44] if you ain't providing for your family
[1:35:46] brothers and sisters we know what the
[1:35:47] word says you're worse than an infidel
[1:35:50] Paul said that if you're not working how
[1:35:53] are you eating
[1:35:54] how could you possibly be eating food if
[1:35:57] you're not working
[1:35:59] Christ Family job congregation
[1:36:03] the body
[1:36:04] the church
[1:36:06] and then Hobbies
[1:36:08] if you've got things you want to do
[1:36:10] screens you want to view places you want
[1:36:13] to go to whatever it is you want to do
[1:36:15] we all have different things in our
[1:36:16] lives we've all been created differently
[1:36:18] to be who we are that's the bouquet that
[1:36:21] God has created different flowers
[1:36:23] different different characteristics
[1:36:27] sometimes I think that myself I could
[1:36:29] get those out of order and I've had them
[1:36:31] out of order I've had my job number one
[1:36:34] my business because you don't know what
[1:36:36] it means to have your own business
[1:36:39] when your own when you're in business
[1:36:40] boy you're moving and shaking you don't
[1:36:44] know what it means to be in business to
[1:36:45] work 16 hours a day and and to not be
[1:36:48] able to be home to put the kids to bed
[1:36:50] and and to do all of that you know
[1:36:52] brothers and sisters that's a choice
[1:36:54] it's a choice
[1:36:56] and you know it's not a choice when
[1:36:57] you're in the midst of it
[1:36:59] it's a choice to actually go and do that
[1:37:02] to say I want to have my own business
[1:37:03] and that's the Trap the devil gets he
[1:37:06] sets that chap he loves it when people
[1:37:08] get so busy I think that I would never
[1:37:10] have my own business again if something
[1:37:12] changed and I wasn't a pastor anymore
[1:37:14] I'd probably go and be the best employee
[1:37:16] there ever was in the whole world you
[1:37:17] tell me what to do and I'll do it and
[1:37:19] that'll be it
[1:37:20] then I'll go home at the end of the day
[1:37:22] and I'll be dad to my family and husband
[1:37:24] to my wife
[1:37:26] but if I did ever have a business I
[1:37:28] wouldn't run it I wouldn't be the one
[1:37:31] doing it I would have it set up in such
[1:37:33] a way that somebody else would be doing
[1:37:35] it because what happens is that business
[1:37:36] stops you stop running the business and
[1:37:38] the business starts to run you if you
[1:37:40] don't have it set up that way
[1:37:42] but you know the reason I say this
[1:37:44] brothers and sisters because the church
[1:37:45] is made up of families that's what makes
[1:37:47] a body of Believers that's what makes
[1:37:49] the church husbands and wives where they
[1:37:51] have children and the children grow up
[1:37:53] and we raise them up according to the
[1:37:55] word and the fear and the admonition of
[1:37:57] the lord it's about having families
[1:37:59] because we know that Christ he wanted to
[1:38:01] have a family that was one of the
[1:38:03] attributes that he wanted to express
[1:38:04] address and brother Brad I'm talking
[1:38:06] about it and Christ is the mystery of
[1:38:08] God revealed he talks about that he
[1:38:11] wanted a family he wanted to be a father
[1:38:12] he wanted to be a husband he wanted to
[1:38:15] be a Healer
[1:38:16] he wanted to be a savior and he's every
[1:38:19] one of those
[1:38:21] brothers and sisters remember that
[1:38:23] habits in our lives are spirits in our
[1:38:26] lives
[1:38:27] habits are not just
[1:38:29] genetic things that we get in our lives
[1:38:31] and we just do it habits are something
[1:38:33] that are learned something that are
[1:38:34] created and it's either going to be a
[1:38:36] habit for the word or a habit for the
[1:38:38] world one or the other is going to
[1:38:41] happen in our lives in our flesh and you
[1:38:43] know it's I think it says that it takes
[1:38:45] 21 days to create a habit and 21 days to
[1:38:48] break a habit
[1:38:50] Just For Something free on the side to
[1:38:53] think about if you've got something you
[1:38:54] want to get rid of just try 21 days
[1:38:57] without it
[1:38:58] and if you do that carnally speaking
[1:39:00] likely you're going to overcome it but
[1:39:02] if you go and look at it again guess
[1:39:04] what's going to happen you're going to
[1:39:05] be right back to where you were but if
[1:39:07] you're talking about spirits brothers
[1:39:08] and sisters if you have been delivered
[1:39:11] of a spirit for 21 days you've been free
[1:39:14] of that Spirit you've been swept out and
[1:39:18] garnished
[1:39:19] that spirit is coming back around and
[1:39:22] he's going to check and see if that door
[1:39:24] is open and if that door is open what's
[1:39:26] going to happen he ain't coming in alone
[1:39:27] he's going to bring seven friends that
[1:39:29] are worse than he was
[1:39:32] we got to make sure that if we get the
[1:39:34] victory in our lives brothers and
[1:39:35] sisters we apply the token that's what
[1:39:37] the victory truly is in our lives is the
[1:39:39] token when we get that we got to make
[1:39:41] sure we apply it that's where brothers
[1:39:43] and sisters I can't say it enough the
[1:39:45] husbands and the fathers of the home it
[1:39:47] is our responsibility to make sure we
[1:39:49] apply that token in our homes because
[1:39:52] our whole entire family depends on us my
[1:39:55] goodness
[1:39:57] Spirits are habits habits are spirits
[1:39:59] questions and answers while having a
[1:40:01] shadow let's see did you believe that
[1:40:03] God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone
[1:40:04] that is truly born again Christian at
[1:40:06] the time they accept salvation
[1:40:08] or do you believe that this is a
[1:40:11] different work of Grace that in the
[1:40:13] experience of most Christians comes
[1:40:15] later please clarify this subject as
[1:40:17] many are confused because of the
[1:40:19] different teaching on this subject
[1:40:22] now if I don't answer this correctly
[1:40:23] well then you ask me
[1:40:25] and I'll put it on my desk for tonight
[1:40:27] and I'll get a hold of it now Christian
[1:40:29] friend a person cannot be born again
[1:40:31] until they have received the Holy Spirit
[1:40:33] so you can't you are not even converted
[1:40:36] until you receive the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:40:38] say you're lost before you receive the
[1:40:40] Holy Ghost because you're not
[1:40:42] there's only one work of Grace one work
[1:40:44] of Grace that's the Holy Spirit and it's
[1:40:47] in three manifestations and we know it's
[1:40:49] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:40:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] he just doesn't say it here father Son
[1:40:55] and Holy Spirit one God only one now
[1:40:58] there's three works of Grace but three
[1:41:00] manifestations there's a manifestation
[1:41:02] of justification by faith a man believes
[1:41:04] God says yes sir I'll believe that
[1:41:06] believe that there's a true God and now
[1:41:08] for my personal savior I accept Jesus
[1:41:11] Christ his son as my personal savior now
[1:41:14] that's what's called justification by
[1:41:16] faith
[1:41:18] which the disciples received at first
[1:41:20] remember the disciples that's as far as
[1:41:23] they went until they went into that
[1:41:25] Upper Room
[1:41:26] and we're not looking at anything
[1:41:27] different today we got to go into that
[1:41:29] Upper Room brothers and sisters
[1:41:31] goes on to say now watch the next thing
[1:41:33] this man will go out today he might
[1:41:35] Smoke Drink curse do things that his
[1:41:38] habits is hanging into him it's just
[1:41:41] rooted in there
[1:41:43] it's spirits
[1:41:45] habits are spirits
[1:41:48] so I'm just going to step back and I'm
[1:41:50] just going to change it up a little bit
[1:41:51] here and say that today he might smoke
[1:41:54] he might drink he might curse
[1:41:57] you know as Believers we don't do that
[1:42:00] we don't go out to the bar room and
[1:42:01] drink and then go to the liquor store
[1:42:04] afterwards and pick up a bottle and take
[1:42:06] it home for safe keeping and make sure
[1:42:08] that we always have liquor to feed that
[1:42:10] Spirit that's in us we don't always have
[1:42:12] cigarettes on hand to make sure that we
[1:42:14] can feed that that demon of cigarettes
[1:42:17] but what is it that actually we have in
[1:42:19] our lives brothers and sisters our
[1:42:21] personal life Brother Brad I'm talking
[1:42:23] about that indoors indoor our personal
[1:42:25] life he says oh don't go there but you
[1:42:28] know brothers and sisters we've got to
[1:42:30] go there that's what's going to be the
[1:42:32] key to our overcoming in this day is our
[1:42:35] personal lives what are we doing in our
[1:42:38] personal life what do we look at in our
[1:42:40] personal lives who are we when we are
[1:42:43] alone because that's exactly who we are
[1:42:45] before God
[1:42:48] even though he has a perfect picture
[1:42:49] brothers and sisters what I'm talking
[1:42:51] about is in our hearts when we try and
[1:42:54] go to God In Prayer if we've got
[1:42:57] iniquity in our hearts because of what
[1:42:59] we're looking at and what we're seeing
[1:43:00] and what we're hearing
[1:43:02] how are we going to be able to go with
[1:43:03] confidence
[1:43:05] but boy when we can go with confidence
[1:43:06] in our lives
[1:43:08] that's why so many people are tossed
[1:43:10] about brothers and sisters they just
[1:43:11] they keep one door closed there's only
[1:43:13] one place uh you can go through the
[1:43:15] whole entire life you can you can see my
[1:43:17] whole entire house you can go into the
[1:43:19] attic you can go upstairs you can go
[1:43:20] downstairs but I've got one safe room
[1:43:22] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:43:24] maybe it's only a little safe in one
[1:43:26] corner of the house just one place that
[1:43:28] only I've got the combination to nobody
[1:43:30] else has it you know what that's not
[1:43:31] enough we've got to be willing to show
[1:43:33] God every single Speck of Our Lives
[1:43:36] there's got to be no personal life in in
[1:43:39] the life of a Christian not that we say
[1:43:40] to everyone just take a look at all of
[1:43:43] my my my laundry room here it's not
[1:43:45] about that it's about surrendering unto
[1:43:48] God and saying be it unto me according
[1:43:49] to Thy word if you want me to stop that
[1:43:51] I'll stop that if you want me to start
[1:43:53] that I'll start that if you want me to
[1:43:55] do something I want to do that
[1:44:01] but if we got a habit in our life I want
[1:44:03] to say check it and see is it of God or
[1:44:06] is it of the devil is it of the word or
[1:44:09] is it of the world habits are spirits
[1:44:13] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:44:14] here's the thing if we have been
[1:44:16] Justified
[1:44:18] if we have been swept out
[1:44:20] fixed up
[1:44:22] cleaned out
[1:44:24] given the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:44:27] if we don't apply that token
[1:44:29] I believe the devil will come back
[1:44:31] around and he'll see if we've been
[1:44:32] delivered and if we haven't applied that
[1:44:34] token we've got to do it ourselves
[1:44:36] he'll come around and he'll give us the
[1:44:38] token but we've got to apply that token
[1:44:40] we've got to be able to hold that token
[1:44:41] out brother Branham says it even we got
[1:44:43] to hold that token over our prayers we
[1:44:45] got to show Satan I've got the token in
[1:44:47] my life you can't do this anymore you
[1:44:49] used to be able to but now I've got the
[1:44:51] token
[1:44:53] if we're not careful those Devils will
[1:44:55] come back and they'll take those habits
[1:44:57] and they'll just be another habit for a
[1:44:58] little while and then they'll actually
[1:45:00] increase then they'll increase and then
[1:45:02] they'll increase and before long those
[1:45:04] little habits will become addictions
[1:45:06] and brothers and sisters doesn't have to
[1:45:08] be a heroin addiction does it
[1:45:10] you know what they call called me what
[1:45:12] they would have called me in the world
[1:45:14] and they still would I mean they call
[1:45:16] people this functioning alcoholics
[1:45:19] they go to work and and they go home and
[1:45:22] they pay bills albeit late usually and
[1:45:25] and not very well but they just sort of
[1:45:27] function
[1:45:28] in life
[1:45:30] but a raging alcoholic but nobody from
[1:45:32] the outside would ever know it because
[1:45:34] they hide it they don't want anybody to
[1:45:36] see that little devil they've got that
[1:45:38] personal life
[1:45:40] but you know what Spirits are habits and
[1:45:42] if we've got something in our lives
[1:45:43] brothers and sisters if we're not
[1:45:45] careful it can become an addiction it
[1:45:46] doesn't have to be like I said a heroin
[1:45:48] addiction or an alcohol or addiction or
[1:45:51] a smoking addiction it can be a video
[1:45:53] game addiction it can be a Facebook
[1:45:55] addiction it can be a a YouTube
[1:45:58] addiction it can be a shopping addiction
[1:46:01] it can be an Amazon addiction
[1:46:04] there's many different addictions in our
[1:46:06] lives the devil doesn't care he just
[1:46:08] wants to get us addicted on something
[1:46:09] other than the word
[1:46:13] out of this why are people so tossed
[1:46:15] about brother Adam says it you find them
[1:46:17] people who seem to be very religious
[1:46:20] seems to have such a deep desire and
[1:46:23] daily they search and hunt and seek for
[1:46:25] God
[1:46:26] and never come to any settlement of any
[1:46:29] kind
[1:46:31] to where they could ever be settled or
[1:46:33] Anchored In Christ
[1:46:35] and this I have learned to be
[1:46:38] inexperience that it is people of
[1:46:40] intellectuals
[1:46:43] remember
[1:46:44] though we walk in the flesh we're not
[1:46:46] worrying after the flesh brothers and
[1:46:48] sisters
[1:46:49] we're talking about strongholds in our
[1:46:51] lives and the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:46:54] not carnal But Mighty through God
[1:46:57] Mighty through God to tear down that
[1:47:00] strong hold of an intellectual Spirit to
[1:47:02] think that because I can read the quotes
[1:47:04] and say Amen to the quotes that it's
[1:47:06] going to be okay there's got to be an
[1:47:08] action in our lives there's got to be
[1:47:10] something that shows the world around us
[1:47:12] whose side we're on
[1:47:15] that's why we go to church on Sundays
[1:47:18] because we show Satan whose side we're
[1:47:20] on
[1:47:23] Liberty says now speaking this there's
[1:47:25] two two different types of Christianity
[1:47:27] seems strange but I'll not say two
[1:47:29] different types I said classes earlier
[1:47:31] forgive me two different types uh
[1:47:33] brother Brown I'm speaking here I'll say
[1:47:35] two different phases would be a better
[1:47:37] word to use not two types two phases the
[1:47:40] same Christianity but two phases of it
[1:47:43] and one of them is an intellectual or a
[1:47:45] mental conception of what God has said
[1:47:47] in his word and of Jesus Christ by the
[1:47:50] way of knowledge and the other is an
[1:47:53] experimental experience
[1:47:55] that God has give
[1:47:57] the man in his heart
[1:48:02] excuse me
[1:48:03] it's an experience
[1:48:05] that God has given a man in his heart
[1:48:08] the one intellectually
[1:48:11] is hungering
[1:48:12] he's feasting on God but his Feast
[1:48:15] doesn't hold out
[1:48:19] the other one seems to have Victory all
[1:48:21] the time
[1:48:23] there's nothing bothers them
[1:48:25] they're just as solid and anchored as
[1:48:28] they can be
[1:48:33] why are you laughing brother Barry no
[1:48:35] trials no storms bothers them at all
[1:48:41] how many have trials
[1:48:43] how many have storms
[1:48:47] but the Branham says but they seem to
[1:48:49] have something about them that people
[1:48:51] who are Christians and trying to live
[1:48:54] for God admire that type of Christian
[1:48:58] the difference is brothers and sisters
[1:49:00] is that longest journey that we've
[1:49:02] talked about the longest journey that
[1:49:04] any human being will ever take is from
[1:49:06] having the intellectual knowledge of the
[1:49:09] word of Jesus Christ being a savior of
[1:49:12] Jesus Christ revealing himself in in in
[1:49:15] in his people of of the word being made
[1:49:18] flesh and manifest to us in our day that
[1:49:21] that intellectual knowledge that God
[1:49:23] sent a prophet that intellectual
[1:49:25] knowledge
[1:49:26] going from the intellect in the mind all
[1:49:30] the way down into the heart that 18 inch
[1:49:32] travel the longest journey that a human
[1:49:34] being will ever take in their lives is
[1:49:37] being able to accept that word in their
[1:49:39] hearts
[1:49:41] it's that little space that we talked
[1:49:43] about that's only created in a human
[1:49:45] being in a human heart for God himself
[1:49:49] he created himself
[1:49:51] you know there's a
[1:49:53] there's a quote here I think it's just
[1:49:55] beautiful I just want to say it I I just
[1:49:57] think it's wonderful
[1:50:00] because brothers and sisters really what
[1:50:01] we're talking about is not just
[1:50:03] overcoming not just being good Christian
[1:50:06] folks not just saying that I believe the
[1:50:09] message of the hour and I can overcome
[1:50:11] it goes from from being the good
[1:50:13] Christian that can overcome and and have
[1:50:16] a storm or a trial and never really be
[1:50:18] moved
[1:50:19] it goes from from that I believe to
[1:50:21] recognizing who we really are
[1:50:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:26] when I I think of someone like maybe Mr
[1:50:30] Trudeau who would be the prime minister
[1:50:32] of Canada if we could think about him
[1:50:34] and his wife Mrs Trudeau there's a
[1:50:37] reverence about her something that we
[1:50:39] would say wow that's Mrs Trudeau right
[1:50:43] Imagine The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:46] when she speaks
[1:50:48] he's spoken
[1:50:51] or she's not the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:55] brother Branham says this in questions
[1:50:56] and answers Cod 1964. I love it because
[1:50:59] for those people who are the the
[1:51:01] quotationists and and want the
[1:51:03] progressive revelation this is near the
[1:51:05] end of his ministry here in 1964.
[1:51:07] brother Branham says please explain
[1:51:09] people are saying brother Branham is
[1:51:11] more than a man
[1:51:13] he can create
[1:51:15] and Jesus
[1:51:16] can look just like brother Branham
[1:51:20] now let me the person said this whoever
[1:51:22] it might be I don't know
[1:51:25] but I am your brother see
[1:51:27] Jesus is your savior I cannot be your
[1:51:31] savior
[1:51:32] for he has already saved you
[1:51:37] I love this he says now you're so close
[1:51:40] to being the truth there
[1:51:43] and yet so far from the truth
[1:51:46] the person that told me this
[1:51:49] now brother Branham could Jesus look
[1:51:52] like you or you be Jesus or something
[1:51:55] like that
[1:51:57] so he kind of belabers this
[1:51:59] goes on to say
[1:52:01] one sense of the word
[1:52:03] that's exactly the truth
[1:52:05] another sense of the word is an
[1:52:08] antichrist
[1:52:10] that's the difference between right and
[1:52:12] wrong
[1:52:15] now if we think about that there was a
[1:52:17] time in brother bradham's Ministry where
[1:52:18] they started to call him Christ Branham
[1:52:21] and there's still a spirit Spirits don't
[1:52:23] die people around the world trying to do
[1:52:25] that now but when brother Branham was
[1:52:26] alive they started to baptize in the
[1:52:29] name of brother Branham
[1:52:32] and I just was thinking about it I can't
[1:52:35] I think it's astounding I had never
[1:52:37] would have believed it but I heard
[1:52:38] someone pray in the name of some other
[1:52:41] man
[1:52:42] recently someone sent me a video and and
[1:52:44] the man was praying a fervent prayer and
[1:52:46] he sounded like a message believer but
[1:52:48] it was in the name of another man
[1:52:50] and I was like wow
[1:52:52] but it's true Spirits don't die
[1:52:54] they're very much alive
[1:52:58] we know brother Bradham when they
[1:52:59] started to do that they started to
[1:53:01] baptize in the name of of brother
[1:53:02] Branham William Branham baptized in his
[1:53:05] name that he said you know what when you
[1:53:07] do that you make me Antichrist
[1:53:09] and it was before the seals were open it
[1:53:12] was very timely on Satan's behalf wasn't
[1:53:14] it
[1:53:15] but he took himself off the field and
[1:53:17] set field and said you know what I won't
[1:53:19] be ministering as long as people are
[1:53:21] doing this if this is the way they're
[1:53:22] going to behave about my Ministry I'm
[1:53:24] off the field I'm done it's not going to
[1:53:26] happen until they corrected that error
[1:53:28] and he corrected it by saying that you
[1:53:31] are Antichrist it's not going to work
[1:53:34] for you to behave that way and that's
[1:53:36] what he's talking about here for people
[1:53:37] to say that you're Christ Branham that
[1:53:39] it's going to be something like that
[1:53:42] in one sense of the word that's exactly
[1:53:44] the truth another sense of the word is
[1:53:47] an antichrist that's the difference
[1:53:49] between right and wrong
[1:53:51] to make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:54] Christ would be an antichrist see for
[1:53:57] that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting
[1:54:00] at the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:54:02] and will come again in great power and
[1:54:05] Glory
[1:54:07] and he will come again in great power
[1:54:09] and Glory
[1:54:11] but people are looking for a different
[1:54:13] type of coming
[1:54:14] of great power and Glory just like they
[1:54:17] were in the days of Israel they were
[1:54:19] looking for someone to come and deliver
[1:54:20] them out of the hand of the Roman
[1:54:23] occupiers they were looking for that and
[1:54:25] it was a scripture we know that but they
[1:54:28] weren't realizing what was happening in
[1:54:30] their day and it's the same thing for us
[1:54:31] today they think that he's coming in
[1:54:33] great power and great Glory today that
[1:54:36] he's going to walk on earth and he's
[1:54:38] going to destroy the enemies and take
[1:54:39] his bride and and take her home he's
[1:54:42] going to meet her in the clouds
[1:54:44] the people who aren't a part of this
[1:54:46] word for the day they're not going to
[1:54:48] see him
[1:54:49] they're only going to see him in you and
[1:54:51] I brothers and sisters that's it
[1:54:54] he says here to make me the person of
[1:54:56] the Lord Jesus Christ would be an
[1:54:57] antichrist for that person of the Lord
[1:54:59] Jesus is setting at the right hand of
[1:55:01] the Majesty on high and will come again
[1:55:03] in great power and Glory
[1:55:06] but for his life that was in him being
[1:55:08] upon me and upon you who have him
[1:55:12] that's exactly the truth
[1:55:16] did you catch what he said there
[1:55:19] in one sense it's completely wrong and
[1:55:21] you make me Antichrist to say that I'm
[1:55:22] Christ but in another sense if his life
[1:55:26] is upon me and upon you
[1:55:29] then it's exactly true then it makes you
[1:55:32] Christ
[1:55:33] but for his life that was in him being
[1:55:36] upon me and upon you who have him
[1:55:40] that's exactly the truth he says this
[1:55:42] and you become Christ this is his words
[1:55:46] here and you remember my message on
[1:55:48] Messiah Etsy you are the word Messiah
[1:55:51] means the anointed one
[1:55:54] now you are if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:55:57] you become the anointed one see
[1:56:01] and that's what I want to get to today
[1:56:02] brothers and sisters it's our
[1:56:03] perspective if you become the anointed
[1:56:06] one that you go from looking at the
[1:56:07] pillar of fire you go from looking at
[1:56:09] the cloud to being in the cloud to being
[1:56:12] in the pillar of fire to looking at the
[1:56:14] world and the situations of this world
[1:56:16] from a totally different perspective
[1:56:18] that nothing is going to bring you up
[1:56:19] and nothing is going to bring you down
[1:56:21] because you know exactly whom you have
[1:56:23] believed and that he is able
[1:56:28] you become the anointed one
[1:56:31] and he says you become the anointed one
[1:56:33] see then there's all kinds of anointed
[1:56:35] ones and you know
[1:56:37] we have heard the message said that
[1:56:39] there's false anointed ones at the end
[1:56:41] time and this is why people get so weird
[1:56:42] when you start talking about this
[1:56:44] because there are false anointed ones at
[1:56:46] the end time but you know brother
[1:56:47] Bradham says you have a way to tell who
[1:56:49] they are you can give them the word test
[1:56:51] you can take the word and see if they
[1:56:54] line up with the word and brothers and
[1:56:56] sisters if if they are weird but they
[1:56:58] line up with the word then say Amen to
[1:57:00] it every single time because that's the
[1:57:03] way God works his children are not
[1:57:05] normal polished perfect individuals in
[1:57:08] this world they are in that world but in
[1:57:11] this world they're Fanatics that's who
[1:57:13] his children are in this world the
[1:57:15] people that truly got the holy ghost in
[1:57:17] the upper room how did they come out
[1:57:18] remember they said it's the middle of
[1:57:20] the day but they're stumbling like drunk
[1:57:22] people are we going to behave normally
[1:57:25] I don't think so we're going to worship
[1:57:28] like we're redeemed like we know what
[1:57:30] he's done for us
[1:57:32] to recognize that our souls the elect of
[1:57:35] God hang over Hell by one chain
[1:57:40] brother Bradham says it that a chain is
[1:57:42] as strong as its weakest link but you
[1:57:44] know brothers and sisters we don't have
[1:57:46] a weak Link in our chain we just need to
[1:57:48] recognize that those links aren't our
[1:57:51] our humanity and and that's where we
[1:57:53] feel like maybe we fall down because we
[1:57:55] we think about our humanity and and our
[1:57:58] our faults and failures as links in that
[1:58:00] chain they're not the links in the chain
[1:58:02] are the word of God telling us that
[1:58:05] though we walk in the flesh we don't war
[1:58:07] after the flesh the weapons of our
[1:58:10] Warfare are Mighty through God through
[1:58:12] the pulling down of strongholds by
[1:58:15] taking every single thought that would
[1:58:17] come into our minds into captivity and
[1:58:19] and The Obedience of Christ and saying
[1:58:22] that idea that I have is it from God or
[1:58:24] is it from Satan and if it's from Satan
[1:58:27] I'm going to discard that thought and
[1:58:28] I'm not going to pursue it any further
[1:58:30] but if it's of God I'm going to say Amen
[1:58:32] to that thought and I'm going to pursue
[1:58:34] that thought maybe it's to phone someone
[1:58:36] maybe it's to go to church maybe it's to
[1:58:38] go on my knees and pray Maybe it's just
[1:58:41] to Rejoice at the Sunrise that he's
[1:58:43] given me today because it's another one
[1:58:45] that it's a gift from him to see
[1:58:48] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:58:49] you are a messiah it if you have his
[1:58:51] Spirit In You And there's no way around
[1:58:53] that that's the way it is for our day
[1:58:56] but you know when we are in our Promised
[1:58:59] Land there's still an enemy going to be
[1:59:01] in our land and this is where it becomes
[1:59:03] treacherous this is where we become
[1:59:04] confused when we get to trial when we
[1:59:06] get the storm when brother Bradham was
[1:59:08] talking about the trials and storms but
[1:59:09] those people are never upset those are
[1:59:12] the Christians that understand that that
[1:59:14] he's brought me through many trials
[1:59:16] before and he's brought me through many
[1:59:17] storms before and I know who is in my
[1:59:20] boat and all I have to do is just ask
[1:59:22] him to come on the scene for my
[1:59:24] situation because he wouldn't have given
[1:59:26] me that situation if he didn't want me
[1:59:28] to invite him into that situation
[1:59:30] he's testing to see that I am who I say
[1:59:33] I am and you know what we we if we have
[1:59:36] any questions about that just go back
[1:59:37] and read the very first chapter of job
[1:59:40] go back and read that the very first job
[1:59:43] chapter one the very first beginning
[1:59:45] part of it I don't know if it's the 10
[1:59:46] verses the beginning of job God seated
[1:59:50] in heaven having a conversation with
[1:59:52] Satan
[1:59:53] the sons of God come and present
[1:59:55] themselves before the Lord right before
[1:59:58] the throne and Satan he comes in there
[2:00:00] too and he says oh hey Lucifer where you
[2:00:02] been uh what's going on he says you know
[2:00:05] I've been up and down through the Earth
[2:00:06] checking things out doing my business
[2:00:09] and he says to him have you considered
[2:00:11] my servant now you could put your name
[2:00:13] in there
[2:00:14] that's no different for job to us have
[2:00:17] you considered my servant it's time for
[2:00:18] him to get a test and we know God
[2:00:21] doesn't hang things on people I think
[2:00:23] it's tremendous talking about this this
[2:00:25] Wilson Rory
[2:00:27] um how how how tremendous his Revelation
[2:00:30] is as someone who has maybe
[2:00:31] denominational
[2:00:33] he said I know God didn't put this
[2:00:35] disease on me
[2:00:37] God doesn't put disease on people
[2:00:39] Satan does
[2:00:41] I don't know if Sister Stella did you
[2:00:44] tell him that
[2:00:47] I was shocked when I heard that though I
[2:00:49] thought my goodness he's got a
[2:00:51] revelation
[2:00:52] this is a man that can't even move he
[2:00:55] can move his head that's the only thing
[2:00:57] he can do and he can breathe and he
[2:00:59] struggles to do so he said he wants to
[2:01:01] get baptized I said we can do it he said
[2:01:04] I might want to wait till spring time I
[2:01:06] think and then I want to wait till
[2:01:07] spring time but I don't think I'm going
[2:01:08] to last until Springtime because I can
[2:01:10] already feel it now moving into my my
[2:01:13] body my chest all of this ALS is moving
[2:01:16] in there and I can't hardly breathe now
[2:01:18] so I don't think I'll make it till
[2:01:20] spring time and so I said to him you
[2:01:23] know don't worry God knows your heart
[2:01:26] you can't make it to be baptized in
[2:01:28] water that's okay people receive the
[2:01:29] Holy Ghost without water
[2:01:31] God knows your heart brother don't worry
[2:01:33] about it and I just prayed with him I
[2:01:36] said you know Lord just just let peace
[2:01:37] like a river flood his room just just
[2:01:40] let it come into his room in such a way
[2:01:42] that just just overpowers him but I said
[2:01:45] to him you know we have we we serve a
[2:01:48] God you know what I'm going to call the
[2:01:49] musicians I'm going to start getting
[2:01:51] expired here here we go I'll maybe call
[2:01:54] the the family as well
[2:01:56] if they'd like to uh dedicate the baby
[2:01:59] brother David
[2:02:01] but uh
[2:02:02] talking to him in his room
[2:02:05] and and telling him I thought you know
[2:02:07] I'll just have a word of prayer with him
[2:02:09] I asked him can we just have a word of
[2:02:11] prayer and so we did we had a little
[2:02:13] word of Prayer
[2:02:16] before we prayed though I said to him
[2:02:20] you know something spoke to me and said
[2:02:22] encourage him
[2:02:24] and I was like man how am I going to do
[2:02:26] that what am I going to do I'm on the
[2:02:27] Fly I gotta think about this and then
[2:02:29] suddenly I don't have to think about
[2:02:30] nothing
[2:02:31] I don't have to take one thought
[2:02:33] for what I should say
[2:02:35] that thought entered my heart and then
[2:02:37] you know what I just started to speak
[2:02:39] and I said hey you know what I want to
[2:02:40] tell you something the god that we're
[2:02:42] talking about getting you baptized unto
[2:02:44] he's a God that I've witnessed with my
[2:02:47] own eyes raising the Dead
[2:02:49] I have witnessed that with my own eyes
[2:02:52] he's a God that I have witnessed healing
[2:02:55] of breast cancer with my own eyes in
[2:02:58] this church
[2:02:59] I have witnessed both of those things
[2:03:01] this is the god that we're talking about
[2:03:03] getting you baptized unto and he was
[2:03:05] like well can't you get me baptized
[2:03:06] can't you just baptize me with this
[2:03:08] special water that my sister's Church
[2:03:09] sent me from Idaho and I said I probably
[2:03:12] could but I don't think there's enough
[2:03:13] of it there it's a bottle that was sent
[2:03:15] there of blast water I said we need full
[2:03:18] immersion and he said you know I don't
[2:03:21] know what we can do about that I'm not
[2:03:23] sure how we could ever do it you got to
[2:03:24] remember this guy's laying flat out he
[2:03:27] can't move his feet he can't move his
[2:03:28] arms he can only move his head how is he
[2:03:31] going to get from his place to water
[2:03:33] back to his place again and still be
[2:03:35] alive
[2:03:37] I'll tell you I've been scratching my
[2:03:39] head
[2:03:40] but I asked the Lord and he showed me a
[2:03:43] place there's a place for people with
[2:03:45] special needs to get into a warm pool
[2:03:49] he said to me how am I going to do it
[2:03:51] who's gonna dry me off who's gonna
[2:03:53] change my clothes I can't do any of that
[2:03:54] I said brother we're not talking about
[2:03:56] this carnality here we're talking about
[2:03:58] baptizing you unto that God remember I
[2:04:01] said there's people that would truly
[2:04:03] help you if you want to be helped
[2:04:04] there's a whole body of people that
[2:04:06] actually work in the health care
[2:04:07] industry and if you want to get baptized
[2:04:10] we'll sort it out we'll figure it out
[2:04:11] brother you don't have to worry about it
[2:04:13] and we went to prayer in that man's room
[2:04:16] and my goodness if the spirit of God
[2:04:18] didn't just come in that room just flood
[2:04:19] that room and I said to him you know I'm
[2:04:22] not going to talk anymore because I am a
[2:04:24] preacher and I'm just getting started I
[2:04:26] feel like I could really talk now so I'm
[2:04:28] just gonna bow out have a good night and
[2:04:30] I'll give you a call on Monday so
[2:04:32] brothers and sisters if anybody wants to
[2:04:34] help if the opportunity presents itself
[2:04:36] please let me know we I think we'd
[2:04:39] probably need three three strong men
[2:04:41] maybe a sister or two maybe just a man I
[2:04:44] don't even know how to do something like
[2:04:45] this maybe just brothers I don't know
[2:04:48] but we might have a baptism
[2:04:50] for someone with ALS before they go out
[2:04:53] of this world and just to think the man
[2:04:55] has this kind of a revelation I might
[2:04:57] not make it till spring but I want to
[2:04:59] get baptized is what he said
[2:05:01] I know that I'm probably gonna die and I
[2:05:03] don't know how I'm gonna figure all this
[2:05:04] out and I said don't worry we'll figure
[2:05:06] that out you just make sure you want to
[2:05:08] get it if you want to get it then we'll
[2:05:10] do everything we can brother remember
[2:05:12] Wilson Rory in your prayers I'm going to
