not able to do anything you came down you picked us up Lord you've had mercy upon us Lord Lord we acknowledge that by ourselves we can do nothing Lord everything that has happened in our life is your grace the fact that we are standing here in your presence is your grace we as a people were never Looking For You Lord we never sought you Lord yes oh but you came after us Lord you helped us Lord you had us in our in in your thoughts Lord I Thank You Lord we are insufficient but you are all sufficient Lord please Lord while we come in your presence today speak to our hearts Lord we want to go from

Lord we thank you for your message Lord we know our times in this place is coming to an end Lord pretty soon we will be gone from here Lord I Thank You Jesus I thank you Lord you are worthy of all honor all glory and all praise Lord I ask a small prayer in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen while we are standing we'll read from the book of Hebrews chapter 11 thank you musicians God bless you my brothers amen and sisters here we go we will read uh for the first five verses uh I will read here you have it up here yeah now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now the last verse that we're going to read now by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God amen amen may the Lord add blessings to the word we'll have a small prayer uh thank you Lord for this word that you've given us today Lord we pray to you Lord anoint it to our hearts Lord and Lord teach us from your word we have come here to learn from you Lord we want to be changed oh all glory and all honor Belongs to You Lord in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we ask this prayer amen amen uh please be seated it is actually wonderful to be in the house of the Lord amen you know when we come inside this door the fact that we are able to come inside here Amen in itself is a big victory you know because said in the message that you know uh we We Are One in a Million you know the chair that you see that you're sitting in here about a million people were contending for this place but they couldn't make it right you know but for some reason how I don't know we can't say but God brought you here he left all of them outside and the fact is that there you you know we know that apart from or outside of this message there is going to be no Rapture you know uh Christianity I believe is still the largest religion in the world you know Islam comes second but in spite of being the largest religion the Salvation you know everybody's looking forward to a Rapture everybody is looking forward to the coming of the Lord everybody says that we'll meet him in the sky and you know in the cloud and you know we'll be taken up but the fact is that is not how Rapture is going to happen right because most of the people who are going in the Rapture are already in the Rapture right now Rapture okay I forgot to tell you the topic that I'm going to preach on is rapturing Faith right so coming back now this faith that we were talking about today that you know that we read here said faith is a that the Bible says faith is substance but brother said faith is a revelation right can you repeat faith is a revelation right it is a revelation from God yeah now what happens is there are different kinds of Faith different levels of Faith you know sometimes like for example uh when we look at the first pull the first pull uh you know in the Bible says that uh gifts and callings are without repentance you know uh healing of the sick and you know a lot of other things like you know casting out of demons and stuff this you don't need to be really saved to do this you know you don't need to have salvation of you know anybody can do it you know even a non-believer can do it right so you have to understand that there are different kinds of faith and the kind of faith that we are going to focus on today is the faith which will translate us the faith that translated Enoch amen okay now when we when we talk about faith here the first pull was healing of the sick okay now uh before I go further I want to also you know uh give a small uh this thing here Point here that the message that I'm going to preach today that I have here is going to be a little deep it's going to be slightly deep now when I say deep I don't mean like you know I'm going to preach from organic chemistry no it's not going to be that kind of deep the deep is like you know I will tell you when Jesus Christ was preaching he went to Israel and then he was saying like you know uh people uh there was a person who is coming who is sowing seeds you know and he sowed seeds and the seed fell in good ground seed fell by the side of the road and the seed fell uh you know in thorns in bushes okay and the people thought that Jesus is preaching agriculture yeah they everybody thought oh yeah this is too simple we already know you know we know where to se our seeds you know we know this is this is farming we've been doing it for centuries now you know right but what he was saying was something else right right now this is where the difference comes in between Revelation and information that's right okay we have a lot of information but when you see that you know you're in a house and you know the house is in Fire and everything is burning and you're still sitting there that means you have information but the moment you realize that you're going to burn you have to run you have to escape from there that is revelation right it puts you in action right information yeah I know the American dollar is right Rising it is falling I have information so what you know the Bitcoins are going high it's coming down I have information yeah good but the moment you realize that oh you know what I can do this and I can benefit from that you know that is a revelation that you get so this is the difference between Revelation and information okay now we are focusing on not just information there's a lot of information in the Bible amen there's a lot of information everywhere you know the denominations are talking about it the heathens are talking about it but there is something which only the Chosen and the elect know righten and like I said when we come inside this building you know actually this building means nothing I'm saying is that when we congregate okay when we become a part of the body of Christ okay now you have to understand that when this happens with us we are something really special amen special why special because each one of us okay when we come into this body of Christ we are directly connected to the lineage of Adam right okay otherwise we were all born in sin we were like you know going here there doing this that and all but then there was a secret that Adam knew yes he had a book inside of him amen okay which once because of whatever he misplaced or you know he went off and he doesn't have it anymore but then he had a descendant his name was Ino okay now Hano fellowshipped with Adam right okay because Adam died if you if you look at the geney uh Genesis 5 it tells you that you know uh Adam lived for almost a thousand he couldn't complete one day because you know they said that the day you eat of thereof you shall die so he could not complete that one day he he died before you know thousand years were over but thankfully Enoch got to fellowship with Adam yes okay so he could tell him that you know what this is where you're coming from ano this is where you're coming from am you know you were not always we were not always like this you know we were not always you know falling sick and hungry and all those things no this is only after a certain time this happened but we were not like this since the beginning right since the beginning we were different that's right okay so Adam used to you know tell and you know you understand now what happens is when I say that you know uh I have to speak on rapturing faith rapturing faith once again is a revelation Revelation which is handed down from your family to only your family okay it runs through a bloodline okay it does not you know it does not go outside the family you know why because Adam after Adam Sai and then you know lame matusa and all those people and you know the the secret or the seed you know travel like that like that like that came keep coming down in the same way now we from Jesus time we are the Seventh Generation once again okay why because we are the seventh Church age although we don't live in the sixth or seventh Church age anymore we are not in laia we've come out of laia we are in the bride age okay but still we are under the seventh messenger okay and it is the seventh from Adam that saw the translation of his body okay so you to understand that we are in a very interesting position right now we are in very interest interesting why interesting because we are in a place where most of the problem Prophets The you know Apostles all those people wanted to be they wanted to see this time they wanted to see how the king of glory comes in you know and how people are changed alive you know and we have all that for us am okay like it or not we didn't choose it we didn't we didn't even know about it but somehow amen you know God just called you out you know each one of you hey you you you you you you y you know I was born somewhere in south of India Kerala my parents they uh you know met in another Province and then you know they came to New Delhi for uh their work and stuff and you know our previous Pastor in Delhi you know he got the message in Bombay then he traveled to Delhi the church was established there and somehow all things worked in such a way that the message you know brought us here me here you from different parts of the world now we are join Point here and you know the Bible very categorically says that you know there are two people one you know in a bed and another you know in the field two in the bed and two in the field one will be taken one will be left have you have you read that scripture now uh I would want to ask you one thing when this one is taken up okay out of these two there are two of everything you know you want to read it it is uh in Luke 17 I believe I have it right here Luke 1734 I think is the scripture I want you to read 34 35 and 36 okay uh brother Daniel can you help me reading the Bible you know it gives me a little bit more uh time probably yeah here it's kind of helpful yeah if you can read the verse yeah Luke 1734 3536 yeah I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left now the one that is taken where is he taken anybody one is taken and one is left okay so the one who is taken where is he taken yeah I can't hear you yeah the Rapture somebody said the Rapture and I would say yes that is right okay so let us read the next verse and they answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gather together amen so you know that you know you said right they are captured in the Rapture but not in the clouds not in the clouds okay because Rapture is a three-step process what are the three steps of rapture okay I'll tell you huh does even shout voice and Trump okay shout okay repeat shout voice Trump yeah these are three steps of the Rapture okay it doesn't happen and you know just you know you're raptured no it it has got shout voice and Trump what does shout do shout gathers the living bride okay shout gathers the living bride so now what has happened here is that the shout goes out what is the shout the message the message came through the prophet it goes out throughout the world you know like person like me living in India in you know born somewhere and all no way I can meet the prophet in America I was born several years after he was gone off the sea you know no but it was not the prophet who searched for me it the message who came for me understand that same for all of us you know the prophet spoke it and the message came to life it is looking for its own right in every country in every village every corner of this world the message goes it picks its own doesn't matter what background you're from doesn't matter how holy or how Unholy you are doesn't matter because it's not about your Holiness whatsoever right so the message goes out it's it picks its own okay it takes takes one and it leaves the other okay it takes one and it leaves the other now this is the first step so the first step is shout now the second step is wise okay when the bride comes together now you you read this they are not all raptured and gone up in heaven they say wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together okay so where is the body this is the body amen body word yeah so we come here together every week twice in a week to eat from this body okay and when we do that we are changing okay we are in the process so if you believe that you know you are in the Rapture you might as well start eating that's right right right and you might as well start being here am because people who are raptured have an address Hallelujah yeah people who are raptured have an address they are not at home they are not here they are not there they're they are where the word is yeah they are where the word is right so it doesn't matter what you want to do how you are your back nothing matters it is the word that cleanses you okay this word no matter where you're coming from what your understanding is what your thoughts are nothing doing no problem just come to the word okay just come here and take life take eternal life okay so that is the reason what motivates us to be here because you know our names are here not in the church list but in the list for the Rapture okay so no matter where you are you know I'm again emphasizing on the fact that you know every empty chair here has got a million people who have lost this opportunity right okay they are still very religious more sincere than us okay more hardworking than us okay more dedicated than us okay but couldn't make it okay so you are the people who are right here right now are an elite group of people when I say Elite I really mean Elite like you know there is this you know when we go in Calgary you know in the downtown you have peace officers okay now peace officers you see them everywhere but there is another team that they said you know that is there you don't see them often but it is called s SW a t they are special weapons and tactics okay now these people don't the roam around the strees like that you know you can't find them but but you are the s sw8 in the message you know why I'll tell you the reason why because you have a need okay you go to the Bible you read it you have a need God will do anything for you anything okay once Joshua was fighting a battle okay and he said that you know I need more sunlight amen he he did not go through physics and you know all that things he just said Son stand still and you know what God obliged the sun had to stand even though it is not rotating we know it was not reol the Earth is revolving okay that's what but then he didn't have to go through you know the technicalities of how you know it will happen because science says that anything which is in rotation in an orbit you know when you ride a bicycle or when you ride a mono cycle or uh you know whatever as long as you're in motion you stay and straight okay when you stop you fall in the same way when the Earth is rotating it is in its place in its orbit if the Earth stops rotating okay it'll fall like a ball down into space so when Joshua said Son stand still you know the word of God swiftly came held the Earth in that place that's right so that he can have more sunlight right you have to understand and that is what you are capable of I am capable of you know what a magnificent God we serve the only problem is today we are living a lot below our yeah you know it yes yeah so the thing is I have come here today to tell you that Rapture is is going to happen yeah okay I can't set the date I don't know the date I don't know the time but I will tell you something the signs of the time okay will definitely tell you that we are in the cycle in the process the process is started okay many people think that you know oh we Christians you know you only you are the few people you know few people who are going to go in the Rapture what about the rest of the Christianity you know so many good people will God leave all of them I don't know about then maybe sometime later they come in the message I can't say but definitely one thing I can say is that if you don't have the word there is no way you're going absolutely no way you're going no matter how good how hardworking how dedicated I have to emphasize and emphasize it and the more I say the less it is because you have to understand that it is not possible we can't do it by ourselves the word is coming for the word amen okay the word is is coming for the world like you know in the Rapture will this Bible still be left or will God take it I don't know but whoever this Bible is inside God will definitely take them amen yeah if you have the word inside of you you are going okay because if you see uh the first coming of Christ is a example for the second coming okay in the first coming what happened Jesus didn't just come and go like this it took him a good 33 and A2 years he was born on one day then he you know grew for about 30 years then he came into the ministry for another three and a half years and that is when he died on the cross and he went up okay so the first coming like you said it is not going to happen it's not a twinkling of an eye our bodies will change in a twinkling of an eye but the coming of the Lord is a process it started on one day it will end one day it'll end with us translating okay so it's a process it's not one day event or a you know the Rapture is a process but changing of our bodies is yeah probably a twinkle of an eye you know and we'll be changed now when we talk about rapturing faith you also have to understand that rapturing faith and faith is a revelation right okay again faith is a revelation and this is you know you have to hold on to this because anybody who is going in the Rapture will definitely have Revelation okay revelation of his Rapture that's right okay and that is important because without that you know there's no going anywhere you know now a little bit more I want to speak on this but uh I I also want to tell you you know there are certain things which happened before I came here to Calgary you know uh it took me almost 2 years to actually you know get all the things done my brother applied for a Visa for us on the 1st of January 2022 okay he did that and then you know it was so slow so slow we forgot all about it you know and then year pass several months passed years passed and then you know no news so they were like okay it is not meant to be or whatever it is so and then in the process we had our youngest daughter jamaa was born and uh one fine day we get a mail from the Canadian embassy uh it's almost two years after this okay after applying now uh they say that you know what quickly you have to submit your passports because you're you know this thing is approved and your you know your Visa you have to get your stamped and then when that happened uh we were like you know we were in the middle of our lives basically I mean you know and uh they gave us almost 20 days time to you know wrap everything up because yeah you know they also said that you know uh you have 20 days because your uh medical is going to expire in 20 days and then we don't know what happens if it expires we didn't wait to check you know so somehow you know so we had that 2 Years Journey that we were in and then you know uh three of us me my mom and my wife were here with seven kids of course all of my children and uh please understand I I'm saying this because the you know this is also a part of the message okay because it has got something to do with all of us so you know uh the spiritual mind will catch it okay now what happened is that you know we're coming from East we coming from a far away country all right and somehow the message brought us here now you know and then suddenly you know they are like uh uh okay now about the date of coming uh I was supposed to book tickets for you know so many people and it was a multi ctor flight like you know I have to go from Delhi to Bombay Bombay to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Calgary because there's no direct connection as such and every time you know we're trying to do it okay we find Bombay to Delhi or Frankfurt then Frankfurt to Calgary connection is full so you know they don't have enough space for so many people to travel at the same time so permutation combination permutation combination I said finally okay let's stop because you know what we forgot to you know apply for a Visa for jamaa if we can't leave jamaa and go here she's like she'll be really angry so we can't you know yeah she's too small so you know we can't leave her and go so you know what uh if it is from God uh you know everything will work smoothly we will get her visa and after getting everything in the clear only then we you know we go ahead with the tickets so okay up and down we submitted her passport and stuff and then it took us two years for jamama it took less than 2 weeks and she got her no passport stamp and then you know I was like okay wow this is fast now uh also just before our visas came and you know before this was processed something really strange happened you know with us we found one pigeon okay we found one pigeon and uh it was in our house and it was a pigon so you know the pigeon is inside the house you know it is like kind of makes a lot of you know disturbance okay you're sitting there it'll come and sit on your head right here okay and then you know I've got a picture of that pigeon on the head okay now okay then we thought that why do we have a pigeon you know we should let it go he should not be you know in the house it's a bird and you know it's not a pet and we don't know this pigon yeah he just you know living with us you know I think you should go now so uh what happened uh my daughter she took the p Pig and like you know we make videos because you're sending off a pigeon so you know the pigeon will fly off and you make nice video so they took the pigeon and they let it off and the pigon went like this and turned and it turned and went right back in the house through a window and the window surprisingly was closed it was only only this much space was there in the window okay in spite of that the pigon of the entire he left everything else it went inside the window back in okay now when the Pon went back in and we were like okay it doesn't want to go now all right let it be so uh you know after sometime then we tried again this time it was Joseph he took the pigon again he flew it away and the pigon again it went and it sat on the wall of the building okay it sat on the wall of the building and then kids were like you know if it sits here some cat will come and eat the pigeon you know so we might as well just get her back in okay oh yeah so then you know they climbed and they got the pigeon they put it back in the house and then uh I don't know what happened to the pigon pigon you know uh escaped or you know I don't know what do you say for disappeared yeah you know somehow okay the pigeon thing is over now the ticketing came now you know if you want I have I have these two videos like I said they made the videos so brother if you can play you know oh yeah see that beautiful pigeon it went and sat on the wall this was the second time okay it didn't go it is sitting right there okay white uh a black pigion yeah right okay it is sitting right there now this is the second uh this is the first time that you know Joseph is letting it go you see that the pigeon went right into that window inside that house okay it's not flying away yeah I mean uh you know I found it really strange that you know why would this bird not go out so okay this happened so we were like okay fine we never connected with anything so you know I'm still learning I'm I you know we we still you know word is still revealing it's still opening so we don't know what the uh end is but then suddenly you know uh we got our tickets and lot of pushing and pulling and finally we got our tickets I have got a boarding pass there brother can you show the boarding pass on it on the boarding pass there is a date the date on the boarding pass is 23rd can you read yeah what does it say June 23rd 2024 okay now this is typically a Sunday and it is absolutely not possible because we being in Delhi you know we never ever ever never ever travel on Sundays never you know like for example we have got in a week we have got two meetings Sunday and Tuesday so we try to do all our you know stuff Wednesday to Saturday if at all we have to go for a vacation we go between Wednesday and be back by Saturday so that we're back in church on Sunday now this ticket it was really you know and I was just sitting there and I was like you know what we are going and at least the last service on Sunday we should be able to you know catch this but then somehow it doesn't I me you know there are so many connections this one was Delhi to Bombay now from bomb it was very difficult so finally somehow the travel was able to fix this so we were like okay fine this is the will of God Let's do let's go ahead with it and when this happened I was curious I was like why a Sunday Lord after all the days you know why a Sunday then I just on I went on the internet I just checked what happens on this day okay so then brother there's another photograph there of a screenshot that I have taken can you show that yeah this is the Sunday June 23rd 2004 okay this is the Jewish calendar which is Shabbat and stuff uh you know Jewish calendar on this day and then I checked what happened on this day when I checked it says on this day 2105 BC noa's Ark okay 7 months after being after the beginning of the great flood 17 days after the water covering the Earth began to subside and Ark Sheltering NOA his family and all these people they came and they you know they landed on Mount Ararat okay Mount Ararat is the new world basically okay so this day that was chosen was typically the day when NOA or no you know NOA we say in Hindi but no landed in the New World After the flood okay so somehow you know things started to match up because NOA left or the dve twice and he came coming back you know that scripture yeah he kept coming back and now the date I did not choose this date I don't know what happened you know this and you know this Monday when I was reading the scripture you know what happened you know uh chill ran through my spine I don't know this phrase but you know you know I was shocked yeah I shock because if you see NOA that is Genesis chapter 6 I believe yeah six let's take the days of Noah I'm not going to read through the whole thing but I just just want to show you a few highlights out of it okay yeah it is Genesis chapter 7 actually Genesis chapter 7 yeah and Lord said unto NOA Come Thou and all thine house into the ark said that when somebody says come okay and somebody says come into the ark which means the person who is saying come is already in the ark okay when he says that that means he's already in the ark so it says that you know lord said unto NOA Come Thou and thy all thy house in the ARK for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation and it goes on like that and then if you see uh you know slowly if you go ahead we will have the dates here okay uh we will go to 11th verse 11th verse 11th yeah in the 600 year of noa's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day where all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were opened okay so this is when the rain started okay flood started so if you see this this chapter it gives you a day by day detail of what happened okay there are other scriptures also in the Bible but this one gives you the dates gives you the dates dates for example on the first day when NOA entered the Ark and then you know after 7 Days the ark the door closed but the rain did not start and it was only after 7 days if you read you know I don't want to go because I have very little time I'm like you know another 40 minutes so I will be very concise but you know you can go home and read this chapter chapter 7 it gives you the date it gives you all the dates and details okay of when NOA entered the Ark and then what happened and then what happened and then what happened so you know these are the numbers uh you know where you can see the Bible gives categoric dates okay now again after this what happened you know after coming to Calgary I happened to visit a library and stuff and I saw that I saw a Jewish calendar a hard copy a physical calendar and to my surprise every calendar has got 12 months a year calendar but then this calendar that I saw had 16 months on it okay I have a picture of that I couldn't get grabb the calendar Because by the time I went back it was gone so this Jewish calendar has got 16th can you see it from there it says 16 months from September to to December 2025 September 24 to December 2025 now I was wondering why would anybody make a 16-month calendar you know it's supposed to be 12 months but uh actually what happens with Judaism is that they have the Feast of the Trumpets on the first day of the sth month okay so that is their New Year okay and also when they were coming out of Egypt God gave them another new year that is the first of you know close to 1 of April you know during that times okay so they have two New Years actually so they start from the Feast of trumpets Raj hashana from there they go on until the next full year okay so that is why this calendar had 16 months now September for some reason was uh you know kind of interesting month for me because you know that is the month when my daughter jamaa the youngest one was born now with all our other kids okay with all our other kids my wife put their names uh probably uh Alia is the one whom I named but rest of the kids my wife now this time I thought you know what J when the last kid was born the youngest one I said you know what I think we will ask our pastor to name her because we've done it so many times now you know I think think I think our pastor should also get one chance now on this okay by the way my pastor in Delhi lovely person I mean you know he's very I I I can't just explain you know I I I there's not the single day that I don't think about you know Pastor there I mean awesome I can't just you know words fail me but yeah you know so yeah so what happened is I I told him that you know we have a daughter then you know brother in India we don't have uh you know uh this thing gender reveal because it is banned you know we don't know the gender of the child before it is born it is a criminal offense to even find out so we don't know so only after the child is born that we do the naming yeah yeah so we we don't do it before that so I called him up and I said that you know brother you know uh I please if you can just give us a name and then he gave us uh the next day I you know I was waiting for him the next day I called him back again you know I have to go for the birth certificate so if I get the name I can put it on the certificate and get the proper certificate and then he said brother John I know I think you know I've got two options jamaa and grace jamaa and grace so I said oh it's too hard for me to choose one of these so we will put both the names okay so she will be jamaa Grace John okay now what happened is when he came back home he was traveling somewhere so I spoke with him on the phone when he came back home his wife was like you know I have also you know uh kept a name for uh John's daughter and uh he said what is it and she said it is jamaa okay so now what happened is that yeah I mean they didn't consult with each other and then he told her that you know this is exactly the name I told him already and they've probably named her also now so and the best part is jamaa means Dove okay jamama means Dove now what Happ you know when these things started happening happening I absolutely understood that there is something major which is going to happen and something is fixing and something is waiting to happen you know when we reach there when we see that you know and today when I'm standing in front of you I am saying all these things and you would probably be thinking why brother John how does it matter you know how does it you know make any difference to us but like I said the message I'm going to preach or it's going to be deep okay many things you might not understand right away I also did not okay but eventually you will because it is important that you you know you you probably don't understand everything but it is important that you believe that this book okay is coming to life amen you know the scripture out of it is coming and is starting to manifest okay it is starting to manifest so when the scriptures manifests you will get to know I I want you to uh uh brother if you can show one message I will give you the name of the message also is right here adoption uh 196 adoption part three it was preached on 22nd 5 okay and Par 85 I'll read it for you for example you know you can search it also adoption placing positionally yeah that's the one brother Daniel can you read this please yeah adoption placing positionally where they at show me where they at where they're at God calling his children aside by manifestation by manifestation okay so now we have to understand that in each of Our Lives this word will start manifesting okay now that is how you can make your calling an election sh because uh now we're not talking about a general manifestation like you know I prayed and he healed me and healing is a general thing you know by his stripes I'm Healed okay it's a generic thing it can apply you know to anybody and coming to that topic of healing okay I don't want to pass this but yeah I want to explain how healing Works in our body also because uh it is important that you know first pull second pull third pull okay we have these three pulls and third pull has got three folds in it the first fold is okay no problem yeah yeah I okay let's start with the first pull don't worry this is now I'm trying to explain to you how healing works okay because even though first pool doesn't assure anything else okay it is the earnest for our Salvation right okay so if you're going in the Rapture you you have to understand that you know like in the olden times when Peter was walking when his shadow fell on sick people they got healed he didn't have to pray for them and stuff okay so today when I say that you know you are very special people okay you're very special people who are sitting here called out you have got some special weapons and tactics which you know the other people perhaps do or don't I don't know but you know healing is something which is your bread it is meant for you it is children's bread okay the others are making use of it but that doesn't mean you should not have it you should have it first right so now what happens is when we talk about healing uh brother there is a uh there is a seven dimensions image that I've shared with you if you can just show me that I have given you the uh the par numbers you can go home and read it because you know we have very limited time and we to wrap everything up so you know I'm not reading the entire thing but you know you'll get an idea now these are the seven dimensions that brother bam spoke about okay the seven dimensions he said in the present stage of my Ministry if you go to uh I think all the dimensions are explained pretty much this uh it starts with light matter time these are the you know three dimensions that we are living in as Mortals okay we have we contact the light and matter and time and all this so we are in this Dimension and this is called a temporal Dimension you know it's not permanent and here you have the region of the Mortal beings this is where we are living right now okay and uh I probably should have used white here but can is it visible from there yeah this one is the region of the lost people who die unconverted okay who die unconverted go here is the fifth dimension okay and in The Fifth Dimension again there is the region of the Demons okay and this is where brother bam said every sickness and every illness is a demon okay we give it a name we call it cancer we call it epilepsy we call it XY Z you know cold flu influenza but it is actually a demon from here okay and then of course this is where their boss sits Satan the you know the underground yeah the underworld thing you know this is where he is okay so this is The Fifth Dimension earlier before Jesus Christ rose up The Fifth Dimension also had another partition which was called The Paradise okay the good people who died in faith because the blood of bulls and goats couldn't really redeem them it will only cover their sins okay so till the time original sacrifice did not come in there was a part here where the good Souls of the the saved people were and it was called paradise and uh when Jesus rose up he took them all up with him okay and then that place is lying open now so there is no more you know that is why says that you know uh The Witch of Endor was able to summon Samuel okay because he was still you know in the in this dimension in Paradise now if you see you know any believer you know or anybody you know they say saying that you know I saw my mom came and my dad passed away but then I saw him having tea and you know I he came and he met me and I shook hands you can know that you know people from this Dimension don't come back in this okay because they are resting there all right and now this is the uh sixth Dimension and the seventh Dimension seventh Dimension is where God is okay and this is where brother bham you know he this is where he went the region of the Blessed is the sixth Dimension this is where you know all the people who are saved who are believers and stuff you know who sleep in the Lord this is where they're resting this this this is the place here and yeah this is the place where you know the people whose names are in the Lamb's Book and the Book of Life okay this is where they go all right and people whose names are deleted from the book like Judas once it was there but it was deleted and the people whose names were never there they're all you know parting here yeah and uh so when you uh see sickness what happens is that we are in the Mortal realm we are here okay we are still alive so what happens a demon from here from this section okay comes around and you know gets attached to us not us but whoever is sick yeah get attached here and then this fella will start telling you you know what you have a slight headache I think okay and and you feel like oh yeah a little bit of headache yes yes slowly slowly yeah and then once you start believing it then it's like you know oh now I really have a headache now I think I should go to the doctor now I think you know so what happens is that uh the the demons from here come here influence you okay or whoever it is influence them and they start believing and once they start believing this sickness yeah manifests okay that is why if you've read in the message even before sister maida had tumor brother Venom once you know held her hand and you know he could see before any symptoms came in the demon was already there okay it was already there now what happens is this demon now slowly slowly he you know it doesn't happen like okay it doesn't happen all of a sudden it takes time it makes you it takes you into confidence okay it makes you believe that you know what you are sick yeah I think you should go to bed you know I think you should take rest yeah now what happens is that is why brother bam said in the meeting and the message he said that you know when the demon comes to you with a package okay okay just say sorry I don't want it yeah I don't want it yeah now this fellow will keep trying he will try as hard as he can okay he will try as hard as he can to get it so the first thing that you should do is deny by his stripes I am healed am okay I'm not sick in the first place headache I don't have headache okay because all these things are lying vanities even when in the whale's belly okay Jonah said this is lie okay he's sitting right there and there is all vomit all around him and the veil is moving at such a huge speed I don't know what is the speed but you know he has to cross the continent and go to the other side so Jonah have you heard of Jonah everybody yeah Jonah okay he was going to in he said I don't want to go so God said okay fine no I will take you there so you know so Jonah in the whales belly all dark all around and but he knew one thing he knew that when Solomon dedicated the temple he said whenever anybody falls off backslides comes back and you know looks towards this Temple and prays god here from Heaven amen and God did answer right so these things even if you do feel that they there is some kind of you know you have to tell the devil tell the demon sorry boss nothing doing no admission I don't want it I don't I don't have to okay you are a liar yeah you are a liar yeah the devil is a liar yeah so you say that and then uh this fellow has no other option but to leave okay that is the first step now next you would come across people who are sick okay so people who are sick or who have got some kind of uh problem and you know things like that you will know that sickness is a demon right right and you have power over demons why because you like I said are w a t you've got something extra that they don't have what do you have extra you have this yeah and you have this right the demons can use this to some extent you know because the Bible says that you know even the even the demons believe okay they believe what this that one day they're going to you know end up in the Lake of Fire they do believe okay so we have something extra all right now this extra what happens is so you see now uh this demon has got this body in complete control and then you know demon is basically you know you can read this in the message of demonology Physical Realm now this demon has attached to this body and it is drawing life from this body and in itself it is growing okay it grows in this body and this you know it makes this body weak and it takes life from this body okay now what happens is when it is taking life from this body you have got the power of the spoken word all right you have to understand that the battle is not here you know battle is not in flesh actually the battle is at a spiritual level in this region yes you have to fight the demons influences okay so what happens is it is real okay sickness is real and demons are real they do cause you know said that uh demons they what they do is they uh I forgot the word for it but nevertheless yeah they there to causes problems you know pain and you know I forgot the right word but yeah so they're coming from here so what you do is when you pray okay and even if you don't pray if you have the word okay you have to know that you are standing on the right ground you will have the conf confidence how will you have the confidence I have got 20 minutes I will absolutely touch on that also how will you have the confidence okay so once you have the confidence you can just tell the demon be gone and the demon will have to flee he'll have to run from there you know and you so filled with the Holy Ghost that you know at at certain point in time demon standing there will start screaming it starts screaming right okay and I I am actually explaining to you the first P but you know you have to understand this is real you have the power right okay you are not subject to anything that you see in this realm because this is just you know in is things that you can see is all not Eternal it's just temporal right okay so So when you say and what happens is further explain this okay when you say when you tell this demon go go back to hell where you came from and be bound there till the day of judgment okay and this demon has to obey when the demon obeys that extra life that was you know the demon that is there and was sucking life out of your body will leave this okay it has to leave it cannot stand there it has got no grounding okay so when this body leaves there oh this demon leaves this body this problem is still there okay the sickness that you know because like for example a cancer it's like you know uh some kind of you know all these weird shaped demons okay so the life goes out of it but the extra body is still hanging there it's still there okay so now what happens is slowly this body will die and it will Decay inside of you okay like for example cancer is a growth in the body so what happens in the body when this growth happens it is taking life out of you but this life when it dies this lump is still there okay now what happens this lump slowly disintegrates remember said that you know when a dog dies on the street if you see after 3 days you know it's it swells up okay so you get your healing because the demon has left but then the stuff that is left in there this will swell up you will start having fever or whatever okay and this is the time when you have to keep your faith that you were healed okay and then what happens this thing you know drains out of your body through your uh blood cells or you know however your body cleans it you know it goes out okay and you're completely healed all right this is the process of healing the first P this is how it happens this this is how it works okay now uh I also want to tell you one thing uh I had asked one of uh yeah to get a balloon do you have it now can I have it please yeah I I'll show you something here and a sketch pen very good yeah you know the balloon is just for shape okay now uh brother I have another image there which is the triangles okay yeah this one now anybody who knows basic mathematics you know you don't need to know all this this is just you but you still need to understand the concept that goes behind this okay the angle some property of a triangle states that angles of the triangle always add up to 180° the internal angles okay like this this angle plus this angle plus this angle is always going to be 180 doesn't matter which direction it is how wide or how whatever it is if this is bigger this will become small you see yeah any shape of triangle you take so people who are into construction and you know not just construction even small kids you know have you has anybody learned this in school you know about this yeah yeah so you know it's basic basic okay on top of this there is further a lot of these things but you have to understand that these rules and these laws only apply on a certain plane right now example what happens like you know for example this is this is a right angle triangle okay these are two perpendicular lines crossing each other so this is 90° okay if this is 90° these have to be less than 90 it could be 45 and 45 that makes it you know 180 so now what happens is but this formula will not apply on a round shape yeah I show you that you know I draw one perpendicular line here uh it's not you know very bright but yeah I draw one perpendicular here one perpendicular here so essentially this is supposed to be 90° okay I draw one more here perpendicular to to it okay this is 90 so how much is 90 + 90 180 now what happens is when this goes in here top and this goes up top it meets here okay because the surface is Round right so 90 + 90 180 and whatever this is this formula fails it goes above 180° you understand so that is why you have to understand that is this clear it doesn't matter that you know you don't need to know trigonometry and stuff it's just that you know you have to go that this formula only applies here it does not apply on this plane know on a circle or you know on this Dimension so what I want to show you is that brother can we come back to the seven dimensions the the the the the laws of physics which apply here don't apply here you understand that the laws that you've been taught here that you know you had to work your way and you have to slog and you to do this you do that you know and if you fall sick go to the doctor and you know you have to take your medicine you to do this you to do that all that is good till that time you know the law was given till that time the you know the original did not come as a school teacher okay so all these things are there that we learn here in school you know that's why it's called the science thing okay science civilization yeah okay whatever we learn here from our peers from you know like you know gravity pulls you back right and you know all these things you have to understand that this is all temporal this this these rules don't apply here okay because uh with the spoken word you can heal right with the spoken word you can create yes now let me tell you if you need a refrigerator you have to know that you have the power of spoken word I'm telling you this is practical okay this is practical you just have to go there wherever you want in the corner you have to say let there be a refrigerator and guess what the refrigerator will be there amen it will be there no you don't sound convinced he said that he said that easy come on come on brother John now this is a little you know no but I'm telling you the fact that you know what you have the power of creation inside of you you can create you know you can create you can speak worlds into existence you have that power in you you know the devil wants to let you know that you know it is not possible but it is possible that is why that is why when we had the prophet standing there and he said let there be a squirrel on that branch and guess what there was a squirrel amen amen right so I am not saying something which uh you know is coming out of nowhere I am seeing is that whatever was done there is possible today amen and also if you would notice I am not preaching Jesus Christ 2,000 years back I'm not even preaching Jesus Christ in 1963 right I am preaching Jesus Christ 2024 yeah right and he is still the same yesterday today and forever okay you have to you know we just have to grow into that gown of Elijah amen Lord is the same right you know God is still the same he does not change he will never change okay we have to come out of this Dimension and get into a faith Dimension where we start doing things by Faith said that faith has got muscles right you know how do you grow your muscles you you know the small baby doesn't have muscles like this you grow your muscles by exercising your faith you increase your Faith by exercising your faith more and more and more and more and one day when you're doing that you know what will happen you're so full of the Holy Ghost that you will leave this body behind because it cannot contain any more Holy Ghost you understand that amen yeah I mean this is the time and you you know this this word is only and only and only for you it is not for the world you know they might be celebrating Christmas and you know New Year and all that and all that being very righteous you know but you have got the word hallelujah right and this is a family affair this is a family this is not meant for other people even if they want to they can't accept it because they're not made of the same stuff it is the DNA inside of you which calls out amen you know and it responds to the DNA which is in the message here and you will know that oh my God this can be done yes this can be done this is you know I I'm not talking about fables this is already been done and it's already 60 70 years past yeah and we are here right now and you know this is our bread and if you have to let me also tell you if you want to change if you think that you're going in the right Rapture it is important that you understand where you're standing now let me come to the point that you know yeah the important point that I was looking at that you know how do you make sure that you know you're saved how do you absolutely how you absolutely make sure that you know the first problem is that you know the devil does is that people who have the Holy Ghost he will make them feel like you don't have it and the ones who don't have it will feel like they the only ones who have it yeah so now you have to uh you know how do we make sure what is the you know full and final you know this thing that you know okay I am saved now the next step okay now when somebody asked John the Baptist who are you are you Elijah you know who are you are you somebody else then John the Baptist replied and he said that I am the voice of the one shouting in the wilderness okay what did he do he identified himself in the scripture amen right right he identified himself in the scripture now he knows where he is coming from right right so if you read John chapter 14 now I'm going to be really quick because we have very less time John chapter 14 okay here we go go 26 verse 26 yeah God bless you my brother but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you okay so whatsoever I have said unto you the the Holy Ghost will bring you into reme it'll bring remembrance it'll remind you that you know what what is happening with you has already happened there it'll positionally place you in the scripture when the word Holy Ghost places you in the scripture then you know where you're standing then you're not guessing then you're not thinking oh maybe I am saved but then I did that thing wrong yesterday am am I saved am I really saved am I not saved no if you find yourself in the scripture this is what the the Holy Ghost is given for Amen to positionally place you in the word yes okay now uh let us take one live example what happened in Acts chapter 2 okay quickly Acts chapter 2 verse 30 I think 32 yeah yeah here we go uh 38 I'm going to skip all that and let's come to the main point here Peter said unto them uh brother please read and then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen yeah now this is the baptism part okay now let me surprise it what happened was these people were standing there and they saw these uh Apostles they were speaking in foreign tongue okay foreign tongue in the sense somebody had come from a different country and from there you see this Galilean speaking French you know you know French was not one of the countries but yeah just to make it in a more context I'm telling they they how are they speaking French they are uneducated people how how did they learn all this language then somebody said no they're drunk they're drunk and then Peter got up and he said my dear friends they are not drunk like you think this is what has been prophesied by Prophet Joel amen so what that whole instance Peter took and placed in the scripture amen okay so that means that whenever you get the Holy Ghost the main you know purpose for the Holy Ghost right now is to positionally show you where you're standing in the scripture so that is why I again and again say that this book is not just a book right it might be for rest of the world but for you this is life amen this is your life you know uh when we see that seven dimensions chart you see your name here it says okay your name is in this book now if I explain it further like you know Lamb's Book of Life and Book of Life the names which are in here okay these are the ones who will recognize themselves in the word amen these ones don't have any portion there because their names are deleted and they're not there anymore right or maybe it was never written okay so these people here are the ones who find their names and in the Book of Revelations if you see it says that you know I will give you a new name so probably the name that you born with Joel or brother Barry or you know brother tabish so this is not the name that God recognizes he will give you a new name and the new name will be a name which is very special to you to you okay there's no impersonation of that there is no impersonation of the third pool first pool yeah they can copy okay demon and no demon they can say do all that but the third pole there is no impersonation your instance is your own okay the White Rock on which the name is written is yours and it is personal to you okay so you will know that you know positionally this is where my role is you know I I I I will give you a small example in very this thing short uh once what happened uh we were there staying in Delhi and there was a church meeting that we had to attend me and my mom we were staying on the first floor uh was our house and then uh I was going going down the stairs and I see that the person who's uh you know that there's a person who is living on the ground floor also so I see that you know the electricity cable which goes down to our meter was kind was spliced so I realized that somebody's stealing electricity from here now uh on the ground floor I asked him who's this what is what is going on he's said I don't know what is going on so you know I didn't have time and uh usually our electricity bills are like you know 2,000 3,000 rupees like that you know on a month but my electricity bill was coming to about 25,000 okay and that was too high then and and and then you know I was like you know of course we are not using this kind of you know usage all of a sudden I I went to the electric company and I complained to them they said you know boss what this till the you know we have got electricity poles okay so till your meter like you know your electricity meter if any anybody steals electricity before your meter that is our responsibility if somebody's stealing after your meter you know it's coming between your meter and your home it's your problem they're not stealing from us they're stealing from you so you deal with it and I was like how will I deal with it okay so I was like I went to the meeting now there our pastor was preaching that day and he was telling about job okay and the whole message was about job and I was 25,000 now what to do okay so you know I was just thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it and then you know in the afternoon the message got over we had food and I was just lying down and something just struck me that one minute it's already 12:00 okay yeah but then I will be very brief okay now it just struck me that job was being tested and some people came and you know stole his cattle and his sheep deep and stuff and eventually God rewarded him okay then I realized that you know I don't need to be worried because this probably is a test and another thing that you have to know have to understand is that the devil like I said the these folks here have no power over you whatsoever not even in their wildest dreams they can say or do anything okay so you have to understand that until unless there are only two chances that you know they can attack you or you know get on you there are only two ways of doing it one when God allows them that is for testing you like you know what happens when you know uh some problem comes in what will you know brother what will you do okay and then God already knows he has confidence he says go ahead try okay don't touch his life but rest you know you do and then God knows already that you know this is what is going to happen so when he has so much of confidence on you he will say okay go ahead now test all right that is one second is when you go out of the word okay this is where our young children have to young and old everybody for the matter have to be you know conscious that you know when you step outside the word okay Bible says that you know this is what you have to do this is what you should not do this is what okay when you step out and this is where the doctrine of balam comes into play okay balam knew that you know these people cannot do anything to Israel there is nobody on the face of this Earth who can do anything to Israel when I say Israel I mean you am okay there is nothing in the face of this Earth that can harm you hurt you or not just you the protection extends to your family and your goods also okay it extends to that also so you can be absolutely you know sure that nothing can touch you okay unless somehow I make them commit something against the word because when the god of Israel is protecting somebody nobody can do any harm to them but if they the ones who are in the protection do something against the word then their God will beat them you know your protector will start becoming your Punisher okay so that is why I don't have the time but you can go home and read a lot of scriptures in Second Kings okay there is this king who came up and he did what was wrong in the sight of the Lord and the go Lord sent him into whatever and you know gave him a punishment and the other king came and you know took his kingdom did this did that did this did that okay so you have to understand you are nothing less okay like for example let me say you know you see a monkey yeah when a monkey has a baby what is it called baby monkey yeah yeah right so so you know when when a horse has a baby okay it's a horse now let me ask you one thing when God has a baby what is that baby going to be he going God yeah so you are nothing less you know what I will tell you you see the water in the ocean so many you know minerals and whatever is there salt and everything is there you take one spoon out of it this spoon will contain everything that the ocean contains only in a smaller quantity you understand that that is very you are yeah okay whatever was there in God he poured into Christ whatever was there in Christ he poured into the bride you know now you have to understand these are the third fold you know three folds of have you heard the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed yeah so these are threefold so now you have to understand whatever is there in Christ okay you have a portion of all that amen he's a Healer you have it he's a redeemer you have it you know what you Angels can't do it Angels cannot preach salvation amen it has to be a bride of Christ who can preach salvation nobody these folks might be here but they are still you know they still not above us the Angels below us yeah they're below so that is why you will understand there's so many other things but you know I'm already over by 5 minutes but you know you to understand that when this happens you have to be absolutely sure where you're standing once you're sure where you're standing you will never fail you have the power of spoken word creation is in your mouth yeah you have that word okay and you are not righteous because of anything that you have done you have the blood of Christ which is your righteousness and also I will summarize and I will end by saying that you know today this is what you know my previous Pastor taught us and I want to really you know tell you this that the blood of Christ today where will you find it where will you find the blood of Christ yeah I will tell you where you will find it see when Jesus died on the cross he bled okay okay his blood fell on the stones and everything in Calvary Calgary Calvary there right yeah and then uh 2,000 years back and then rains came it swept it away okay and it went mixed in the earth and stuff but then what happens is that before it became flesh okay where was the blood it was word okay and you see John 1:14 if you read you know in the beginning was the word word was with God and Word was God and then word became flesh and we beheld his glory okay so he was the word and today Peter John James they did not have the full word okay they did not have it but today you have the full word right amen this book was locked it was sealed but this is the key that Adam lost okay now when you have this key when you look at it through here all your problems are solved you are back to where Adam fell from only thing is the currency here is Faith it is not dollars it is not rupees it is not anything else the currency that you have to use is Faith amen okay the faith currency okay now uh brother Barry I am already over my time so uh how much more time can I take how much longer how much longer yeah yeah they stop ping you're not stopping you're not stopping I don't see a single person sleeping here you know yeah I mean yeah you know that is wonderful now uh no seriously I I just want to touch on a very important topic but I can't finish it within you know 2 three minutes I can't uh you know it's a very very important thing uh that I really wanted to I wanted to do it in the starting but I couldn't get there but if you permit me if I have a 100% hand raise probably I will go another you know 15 minutes if I got 100% no I don't have 100% right now people yeah no we can do it later on also right brother Barry part two yeah part two yeah yeah okay so uh like you said you have it you are the chosen you are the bride of Christ not you don't have any doubts don't don't have any reservations in your mind if you can do it or you cannot do it I told you one will be taken up one will be left the left forget the left you are the ones who are taken up and you're brought here in this word you know you've brought here you've been brought here to the word and this if this isn't you know uh evidence enough what else amen you know today or tomorrow you will realize where you're positionally placed you know adoption but before that you know at least you're in the right address right you know you're not running around in the world seeking God right yeah many people are seeking him but they don't find him amen but you know you such a privilege we are sitting and you know we've kept it in our pocket and purse and then we walking hungry brother please you know somebody wrote a check and gave and I have the check here I just have to encash it no I don't know I kept it here but I'm still hungry I'm going around you know oh my God please help me please do this please do that you know no no you don't have to be the all these Realms everything is for you you know God saw this plan he made this plan so that you can come to a realization and that realization will give you the rapturing faith amen right that realization will give you rapturing Faith so I will call the uh musicians my brothers and sisters please come on stage so that we can oh seems like they don't want to is it yeah we will we will probably continue another day yeah so I overshot by 10 minutes so yeah good yeah God bless you praise Lord I'm happy you know I'm happy that you know I am with you you know I just feel at home and I don't feel any pressure here you know and I love brother Barry brother all of you you know you're like when I see you it's like you know this Garden full of flowers you know oh and lovely people believe me whatever problems you have whatever big sin V whatever you've done everything is under the blood God looks at you he sees only Jesus Christ he sees only Jesus he doesn't see anything else he doesn't see any sin any wrong Any Lies nothing you are absolutely washed in the blood of the Lamb you're white as no yeah there is nothing wrong with you nothing whatsoever you are a redeemed people you are a people with a promise you know doesn't matter what your financial standing is how educated you are or how strong how long how tall does nothing matters what matters is that you have the word the Holy Ghost Has Come For You am okay please let's stand I don't know how to end this because it's not ending so I will just invite brother Barry brother Barry you please come over and say the final prayer and you [Applause] know yeah brother he we're going to have a part two oh thank you so much God bless you my brother God bless you yeah [Music] Hallelujah don't you just love hearing about who you you are amen boy I got some notes here you know I just have to say this I have to read a scripture and I've got a little commentary I think it's wonderful just to remember out of second Peter out of second Peter chapter 1 he says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord and I think it's so wonderful the way brother John brought it today the way the Lord brought it through brother John rather that we're not talking about a historical knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ many times it's put off that way that we're talking about a historical informational discussion but we're talking about the life of Jesus Christ right now The Great I Am present tense according as his divine power hath given us sorry according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him again present tense knowledge not not some knowledge from our parents or through a pastor but our own experience that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might ye might be partakers of the divine nature get the Holy Ghost having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity this is the verse I wanted to get to for if these things be in you and abound the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you don't have to try and find all of the portions of those just get the Holy Ghost in your life and you automatically have all of those virtues in your life if these things be in you and abound they may make you that ye shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ I think it's so beautiful he can go on and say but he that lackthe things is blind the one that gets puffed up and says I know it all I know been in the message is longer than you've been alive brother what you can't tell me nothing when we start doing that we forget he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence be careful give diligence to make your calling an election sure don't look at anybody else for if you do these things ye shall never fall I just think it's so beautiful I could really start preaching right now I mean wow it's beautiful the regions of the Mortal beings is where we exist in that in that in that chart that brother John put up there it's so beautiful you know and we talk about how demons have the ability to come around and attach themselves to our lives and and cause problems and wreak havoc and and really what they do is they influence us that's all they can do is influence us a doctor says oh you've got this now you have the opportunity to say yes I do or no I don't even though you say no you don't you can still have the symptoms because you can still have an Affliction of a devil but just as influential as those devils are from the regions of the lost even more so are the Angels of the Lord behind his chosen children his chosen ones my I need to hyper her down I know I'm inspired from today and and I think it's wonderful to hear the word of the Lord when we hear a message that's preaching about who we are it's just such a wonderful thing God bless you brother John we'll be praying for you we certainly love and appreciate you and your family and your stand on the word amen amen my can we this bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this word today knowing that it's not just this word amen but it's you Lord as we read in the scripture to start the service

recognize who we are in the day in which we live Lord that we can see the signs all around us a and to be able to see that Lord you have done it all for us that every single good gift given unto man comes from above Lord Jesus there's nothing that's happening in our life that we have gone out and done it's because you have given us the gifts that we have and we thank you for that Lord Jesus if we have health in our lives we thank you for that Lord if we have wisdom in our lives we thank you for that Lord every single thing in our lives Lord Jesus let us never ever forget to give you thanks for
