prayer just want to continue to remember Asher Van Der plas brother Sig Clark is ill and for the Gilbert WAMU TT has been requested to come and help so he's in Edmonton as far as I know helping out there and uh let's just go demon prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful this morning that we can gather together on this side of Eternity Lord knowing what you've done for us and Lord the only thing that we have to do is just believe there's nothing that we need to do on our own father is just believe you and take you at your word and this morning we're standing here to declare that's what we're doing father where where two or three or 20 or 50 are gathered together in your name we know that you're in our midst this morning Father and Lord Jesus if there's anyone here this morning that doesn't believe that I pray Lord that you would just make that so real to them today Father Lord like never before that we would get that that we would understand that you are here now oh Heavenly Father there's no need that you can't meet there's no request that you can't make for us in our lives if we could only believe father Lord we believe but help thou our unbelief father help my unbelief father I know that we all suffer from it Lord but we know that you can change everything in our lives in the moment in the twinkling of an eye oh Father we just ask that you would meet the request Lord as we've spoken them this morning Father and even brother Tim Cronkite father we haven't spoken his name but we just thank you for touching him Lord in the name of Jesus Christ thank you for touching brother Frank Cronkite in the name of Jesus Christ thank you for touching sister Marcella Cronkite in the name of Jesus Christ father we know that we all have needs in

Lord Brother Sig Clark maybe just in need of a touch from you father who's maybe his physical health is failing but it's not changing his spiritual health Lord if anything it's increasing it father we pray that you would just continue to pour out a blessing on the Clark family Lord Jesus and father we just ask that you would give brother Gilbert a fresh call off the altar father for today and tomorrow and every time he's there to take a service Lord that he would just be a true inspiration to the body of Believers in Edmonton father we pray for each and every need made known unto you this morning with an uplift hand father Lord that you would just reveal yourself to each one father through the need that it wouldn't be a problem that it wouldn't be a an issue but that it would be a victory that it would be a circumstance that we can rejoice in because we know that you've come on the scene and that you've made yourself known personally to us Lord through the need father we love

commit this now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord thank you musicians you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read from Ezekiel 11. I feel so so inspired from Wednesday my goodness so we'll go with the inspiration lies Ezekiel chapter 11. just one verse we referenced it on Wednesday and we'll just say it this morning Ezekiel 11 19. I believe this is the desire of every believer and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of Flesh let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word as we sang this morning Father we thank you for your goodness Lord where so many times in our lives father we try and do it our way and we try and do it according to our own intellect and we try and live out your word through maybe our own traditions and our own senses but father we know that you said you would do it and we just want to lay aside all of our intellectuals and all of our senses this morning Father and just allow your your Sixth Sense Lord your spiritual sense the sense of Faith Lord your spirit to move in our lives Lord maybe just to do something special for us Lord Jesus today I know that each one of us has a need in our lives Lord in our hearts and father we just call upon you now

word Lord break it fresh to us once again we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you this morning you may be seated my goodness certainly thankful for the the songs this morning the atmosphere that's set it's just wonderful when you get in the presence of the Lord and you have the ability to just worship Him freely there's people that would love to have the opportunity to gather together and just worship freely in this world but they know that if they dare try that they would be thrown in prison so they have to worship secretly and worship underground but we have been given such a blessing to be able to gather together in his name are you happy this morning just a few announcements before we get going here I just want to remind everyone October 1st is a Sunday we have brother James nuvanda Bandy here I believe it's October 7th and October 8th we will have brother Danny del mundo here from Philippines is that right brother yeah that's what we had arranged so October the 7th and October the 8th we'll have two Services Saturday evening at six o'clock and Sunday at 10 o'clock it's going to be dad brother Danny del mundo and his family will be here from Philippines they're the ones that we actually traveled around with in Philippines he's a brother that has a church there and he has many different outreaches and we have supported him in those outreaches quite a bit and look forward to many more supports in the future to see what's going on um he has a lot of influence there and he's just doing a wonderful work there he has a youth retreat he bought a campground he bought just raw land and they actually created a youth camp there and I think they can host up to a thousand people um and I think this year this year they're going to have or is it next year they're going to have an international youth convention so if anybody is interested in an international youth convention in Philippines it's going to be there it's going to be a tremendous time I know he's had a few youth conventions so far and there's a lot of people that go to it but it's just tremendous to see when someone has a burden and they put their shoulder to the wheel and put it before the body of Believers and just see what the Lord will do you know so um October the 31st we have a gym night coming up so while the rest of the world goes and celebrates the Halloween spirit we'll get together with the Believers and just maybe have a little bit of steam blowing off or play some sports and just hang out with brothers and sisters for those who can come and for those who can't God bless you there's no pressure getting into our scripture today I just thought it was so wonderful on Wednesday I think the Lord did something real special for us I I learned something myself that I had never really seen before I had known it from a different perspective you know we can be having justification in our lives and sanctification in our lives and and go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I have known and I'm sure every one of us have known that you can you know maybe potentially get a little bit slanted in one area or the other of those on your journey on our journey to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can get stuck in you know the justification portion or maybe a little bit sloped into the sanctification you know look what God's done for me I'm in a position where everything is good in my life but not really understanding that we just maybe haven't come all the way to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but we heard it on Wednesday and I thought it was uh just an amazing thought yeah thank you brother I always forget these details even though they're quite pertinent we have a potluck after service as well it's going to be in our house thank you brother Peter if you have any questions about directions or anything maybe just uh we'll talk after service about that but yeah talking about this uh this idea that you know sometimes we can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not realize it Satan will come around and try and and throw us off and and make us desire it when we already have it and we know brother Branham tells stories about that people they've gone to church after church and meeting after meeting and situation after situation looking for the pearl of great price and not understanding that they've had it all along and you know they finally get in front of brother Branham the prophet of God for the day and he says you know what you've had it all along Satan has just pulled one over on you and and what a tremendous thought can you imagine the Liberty that would come from that or or on the other hand to to think that maybe you you you haven't got it and and you you're struggling to get it you really want to get to that place because you just don't have it I think that either way the Lord can bless us and he will bless us with the right desire in our heart it's so wonderful because it's not even something that we desire on our own naturally humanly speaking we know that there's a very small percentage of people who will actually be able to go on to the true baptism of the Holy Spirit there's many people that would contest that to say well I've got the trinitarian doctrine and you know look at the millions and billions of people out there but we had a prophet of God in our age that said there will be millions and billions of impersonators of a Christianity in this world and it's very tough words I know it is but you know what we're here in in this assembly because we believe the word that was given to us by a seventh angel messenger by the messenger William Miriam Branham we're not here because we we necessarily have a social click and and we really want to socialize with one another and we find that there's a whole lot of things in common in our lives that's not why we gather here even though when we do start to fellowship with one another we realize that we do have a lot more in common than maybe we would realize but Naturally Speaking we probably wouldn't just go and and hang out with one another in this world sometimes it's really good to just zoom out and think about that to have those discussions because there's one thing that is in common that's very much in common and it's the same thing as the book of Acts it is the true word for our day and some people might say well you know what there's there's another word and and that word is the word of God and it truly is but unless the Mysteries that were contained in this word of God are revealed then where are we and you know what we have the ability to see those Mysteries unraveled and and it really is the the beauty of the message of the hour We're Not groping in darkness we're not looking for certain scriptures to be fulfilled we recognize that many of these scriptures have already been fulfilled we talked about it even Snoopy the cartoon Snoopy uh uh Schultz is his name the the artist he did a cartoon of Snoopy and and the last words in it um I can't remember what it was about but I remember Snoopy saying wasn't Elias supposed to come first and then we know that there's going to be a group of people in this world that are going to say the very same thing but wasn't wasn't this supposed to happen first and and wasn't that supposed to happen first and not recognizing that it's already happened just like in Jesus day they said isn't Elias supposed to come first and he said you know what he's already come and they've already done to them whatever they've listed whatever they desired and they didn't recognize it initially that he was speaking about John the Baptist but then a revelation from Heaven came to them into their heart and they recognized wait a second he's actually speaking about John the Baptist when he said Elias huh so anyways I I don't want to go too far with that this this morning but I just think it's wonderful we have been given all of the Mysteries it's it's the Mysteries are histories now and and if we don't know them then we will certainly work on trying to help one another just understand the word of God for our day but today I want to talk about this scripture and I want to go into a little bit more detail uh with this scripture here in Ezekiel understanding that God speaking here he says you know therefore say thus saith the Lord God isn't that beautiful just those words thus saith the Lord God he is speaking he's making a prophetic utterance through man to his people and I just can't help but think we've had that in our day how many times have we heard thus saith the Lord so many times in the message of the hour thus therefore say thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel this morning I want to talk about this and say you know we understand that this scripture is speaking very specifically about the the Jews about the Hebrews about the real tribes of Israel but we know that every single scripture has a compound Revelation and a compound meaning and the promised land that we're talking about as Gentiles is the holy spirit that's what we're talking about so when we hear the land of Israel I want to highlight this underline it bold it exclamation mark it this morning for us that he's saying that he will take his children he will pull them out of the lands that he has scattered and he will bring them into a new land where they will be safe and that new land is in him in Christ it's not going to be some destination somewhere in the world it's going to be in the ability to believe all of the word for your day because outside of that is an anointing of the Holy Ghost it's not the indwelling of the Holy Ghost it's not the person of Jesus Christ remember once a little while ago we talked about the the story I guess it was Easter we talked about the story of Jesus and how he was an offense to the Pharisees they hated him because he knew the word better than they did but he wasn't educated and they knew his parents they knew his lineage they said oh he's just he's just the son of Mary and Joseph in fact you know he's actually a fatherless child if you follow what they say how how on Earth could this man be the one the one that's the Messiah that these people are claiming it we know that he was an offense to them but here we go we have him invited to this religious man's house he's relaxed invited to come to a feast at Simon's house remember and there he is he's invited to it and I just can't help but think how many Christian churches how many Gentile churches in the world today invite Jesus to their meetings in Jesus name come to the meetings in the blood of Jesus Christ come to the meetings oh my but when you start to talk about thus saith the Lord oh you're going too far there can't be any more thus saith the Lord what does it say in the Bible there can't be any more of thus saith the Lord doesn't say it but outside of the revealed word for your day just like every single age in the Bible are you really appreciating him when you invite him because he always comes where he's invited but unless you're willing to come according to his word you invite him to the meeting but then you ignore him because you don't want to go that far you can't do that no way I won't do that because we've gone to to our our theological studies and we've been shown that it's a trinitarian doctrine that there's three persons in the Trinity which it doesn't even make sense according to the English language but we you know we can go the wrong way a long way the wrong way with it and think that we're right and I want to say Lord help us because we don't want to be the ones that are saying that everyone else is wrong and we're right we want to say hey Lord I want to line up with your word just let your word be my yardstick let your word be my measuring stick let me light up with your word and at the end of this life when I have to stand before you I'll say Lord I just took you by your word I wasn't willing to take you by some man's tradition or maybe some other person's Grudge or some other things issue I simply took you at your word I want to speak exclusively today out of what does it take to make a Christian Life in 1957 what does it take to make a Christian Life paragraph 12 brother Bradham says but in the word I find that God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ I think it's so beautiful when we can look at that because that's truly what we believe that is the truth that is what the the Gentile Church according to the message of the hour is built upon and and The Business of thinking that we need to run it any other way is man's idea and I'll tell you what I'll go further than that and simply say it's Satan getting in the church it's that lukewarm Doctrine getting in the doors of the church within the framework of the Christian Church getting in there and trying to mingle it and say well you know what that Pastor one time he did that and it caused all of this and and now I can't just go that far anymore because of that Pastor that one time God's not going to say because of that Pastor one time it was okay for you here's a pass you don't have to believe my word and follow every letter of it he's going to say why didn't you follow my word what does that Pastor got to do with that what does that have to do with you follow thou me is what he'll say but he's intended for the Holy Ghost to govern the church so when we see someone wanting to try and run the church like a business try and run the church with control over every single area of the church control control who's running the church there's got to be room for the Holy Ghost there's got to be room for Christ to run the church and sometimes it can look like wait a second maybe it's a little bit out of control maybe the pastor should just be jumping on that situation and acting on that situation maybe the pastor is the right way spiritually because of the pastor goes and jumps on a situation sometimes maybe he'll get in the flesh and maybe he'll say things that he can't take back maybe he'll make the situation worse and and it's like that as human beings if we go and try and do that we're going to make it worse we're not going to make it better but he says it's not designed to be governed by intellectual or by Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ I love how he says that because that means everyone right it's the body it's not the church it's not just the pastor it's not just the deacons it's the body it's everyone together and I think in doing that excuse me with that in mind and in God's program we will never be successfully no matter how good our intentions are until we get back to the center of God's program and and where the Holy Spirit that's where I left off too I was wondering what he said there but just get back to the center of God's program just get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters and and everything will actually change but I just think it's it's amazing because there can be a time in our lives going back to this point I'm going to keep driving this home and some people might get upset with me but just bear with me I just believe the Lord wants something said here there can be a place where we think we've got the Holy Ghost and we don't quite have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives yet we just maybe haven't gone all the way we can have a new spirit we've read it we'll read it again today we can have a new spirit he'll take our spirit and and give us a new spirit he'll reform our spirit he'll make us a new creature in Christ Jesus but we might not have gone all the way to get the Holy Ghost now there's a few markers in here that we'll get into today I think that will give us the identification on whether we truly have gone that far or not and I want to say it the word of God that we read today and and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take out the Stony heart of their flesh and I will give them a heart of Flesh I believe he's saying that I will give you my heart my literal heart will beat in you now maybe that's crazy because how can his literal heart beat in US I don't know we'll just take it with his word and say that's what his word says he's going to take out our heart of Flesh and put in a heart of Flesh why would he do that why wouldn't he give us just a different heart that's a spiritual heart probably because we still need to live in this world I would say we still have to live in this world but not be of this world there's a new spirit that lives inside of us and this this new spirit that he gives us gives us the ability to get along with his spirit I think it's so beautiful Lord help me I want to get along with this spirit I don't want to get stuck in a position where I think that I'm saved where I think that I've got the Holy Ghost and find out one day that you know what somebody did give me the keys to their Cadillac and now I've got a new Cadillac but the church has gone on you know that story brother Branham talks about for someone laughed and they gave them the set of keys for their Cadillac and said you know I won't need these because the Rapture is going to happen I don't want to be that Pastor is what I'm saying to you I don't want to get stuck with a pet Doctrine thinking that I've got my angle I've got my way I've got my thing and I know that I'm right about this I want to be humble before my brothers and sisters and say let's let's come together according to the word of God and reason one another according to the word of God let's not have a pet Doctrine and say that I'm just going to hold this with all my might if there's going to be a pet Doctrine let's let's go this way I would say I want mine to be behold I I show you a mystery that that not all of us shall sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye something's gonna happen one of these days we're not going to be stuck to this world and our our pet doctrines and our thoughts about what we think should be happening in this message brother Branham just for the sake of time I'll just cover a few things here he talks about you know new wine in an old bottle and I had you know maybe another thing I've heard him say it before but I've never really studied it and looked at it this way he talks about how the new wine is actually placed in animal skins and that's what they're referring to in the Bible when they say new bottle and I had always thought the bottle was something glass maybe ceramic Pottery something from the desert you know hard no he talks about it being an animal skin and an animal skin when it's skinned out and it's it's treated and it's fresh it gets stitched together and it can hold a liquid it can hold a wine and and specifically the wine is the the stimulation of the Revelation right brother Brown talks about that in the seals very specifically but the wine itself he says needs to be in a skin because it actually ferments it's still fermenting and back in those days that's how they did it and the reason for that when it ferments it can stretch it can grow and it can allow the wine to mature to come to the place where it's it's done growing and now it's mature and it's good wine now uh don't ask me why I would say that but I I just know that wine gets better with age that's what we hear about I guess but you know that's what that's what they did then and and brother Branham talks about how the Skins the animal skins the reason they could actually do it when they're fresh is they contain oils the oils in the flesh in the skin gives them the the ability to elasticize to stretch to have flexibility and if you've ever dealt with leather you would know what I'm talking about but but brother Branham says as long as they're wet and they're moist they won't leak but sometimes they get dry sometimes they get emptied out and you know the reason why the the wise virgin went in into the marriage supper and that door got closed and the unwise Virgin that was with the wise virgin they both had lamps they both had oil one had more oil than the other one had enough oil to trim their laps and actually make it burn bright and clear and the other one just didn't have enough oil they had oil but they just didn't have enough oil sometimes we can let our oil run out the reason why we come to church we need oil and you know what the oil typifies in the Bible is the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Spirit and we know the wine is the stimulation of the Revelation and we know that it says in Revelation you know I believe it's in six uh a measure of wheat for a penny and a measure of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil or the wine there's coming a time where there's going to be a spiritual famine in the earth and I don't know if there's ever been a time like there is now where we look around everywhere and we just see evil everywhere continually in the in the hearts of men in the thoughts of men mankind it's just evil the the world is turning evil there's nothing that we can do about it except for look up and praise God because we know that he's called us by name but the reason we come to church is we know that we can get a topping up of oil and if we don't come to church how can we do that brothers and sisters we know that the word of God says that the the five-fold ministry is given for a reason and that's for the perfecting of the Saints but I'll just say it the way that we're talking this morning in that slant in that vein and that's to top up our oil so we can come and and fellowship we can come and worship God pour ourselves out as a as a free will offering unto him the first beginning part of the service not caring about anybody else just worshiping God and telling him thank you Lord for saving me thank you Lord for giving me the Holy Ghost thank you for saving my children thank you for giving me a healthy marriage thank you for giving me all that you've given me if you've got breath in our lungs Lord anything in my life that's good all good things come from above thank you Lord we can take the time to worship Him and thank him and then allow him to come forward with the word from the ministry no matter who it is it could be a donkey up here and some people might think that this is one but it doesn't matter if you have the right heart God will talk to you God will speak to you but that's the reason we come so that we can get topped up with that Holy Ghost and you know brothers and sisters to try and do it any other way is outside of his word the blessing isn't there Satan's gonna come around and say oh sure it is sure it is you can get blessed no problem you can Heap to yourselves teachers having itchy ears and you'll get just whatever you need sure enough you might but it might not be according to God's word the animal skins they contained oil and as long as they're wet and they're moist with the oil they won't leak especially when that wine gets put in them when that wine gets poured in on a new bottle what happens is it's pliable and elastic and it can stretch and it swells up as it absorbs that line and all the stitching holes they swell up around the threads and everything just becomes tight and when it starts to ferment it just blows up a little bit like a balloon and I just can't help but think when they would open a new bottle of wine how it might just have a little when they open the cap just like a maybe a pup it would just let out a puff of of energy of air from the pressure that was inside of it and they could enjoy that wine they could they could be stimulated with that wine but you know what happens is when that skin starts to get a little bit dry the threads actually they can actually leak where the threads go through the the leather the leather starts to to actually shrink and when it shrinks it will crack and and that wine will actually leak out so I can only imagine they they consumed it fairly quickly they didn't just leave it open like that but once that skin was emptied out you can't pour wine in that in that skin because it's all dry and it's all cracked and as soon as you pour new wine into the old bottle we know this scripture if you can't pour new wine into an old bottle because the bottle will break when you put the lid on it you can pour the wine in it no problem and it might not even leak out but as soon as that wine starts to grow and ferment and expand what will happen is it will crack what the brown talks about in this message here and you know I just can't help but think he wasn't just talking about wine bottles he wasn't just talking about wine skins he was talking about human beings he was talking about those people that would either choose to get filled continuously with the stimulation of Revelation or actually dry out a little bit and then they just can't contain it anymore because that Revelation is just too much the wine needs room to expand when it ferments what does it take to make a Christian Life the Branham goes on to say God's Eternal Plan of Salvation for his people is the holy spirit in the church Born Again men and women operated by the Holy Spirit not them trying to operate the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit operating them do you see it The Madam talks about it in one of the messages I don't know if I have it in front of me where we can pray for someone and expect God to come on the scene to deal with that someone maybe they're sick and if he doesn't heal them the way that we think that he should heal them then is he God have we done something wrong he has a will and his will is going to come to pass and that's what the believer's life says that's that's where we are in in our day-to-day we can't just wave our little wand and say that we just need to see the Holy Spirit Come on the scene and now he's just going to come on the scene God don't clown for nobody I talked about this a while ago and forgive me for the comparison but I think it's important we live in a real world I saw it was it was a silly game show but I was on the floor with it I could not believe it this one woman came to the end round of this game show and one I wasn't watching a whole game show just for the record it was just just this one part that popped up and I was like what is this and uh when I was a kid this game show was on that's what caught my attention but this woman comes to the the final round where she gets to win big or whatever it is and and she's just about to start he says the host says are you ready to start and and everyone's excited and it gets a little bit quiet and are you ready to start and she's like oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait and what she did was literally this just wait one second Holy Spirit activate Holy Spirit she started doing this chant Holy Spirit activate on a game show I was like are you kidding me right now you're belittling Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost himself to a stupid game show is that what the Christian world has come to just wave your little wand and we'll see Jesus Christ come on the scene right no no get in line with his word get in line with his word and he wouldn't even be there on that stupid game show right get lying to his word and you wouldn't even be watching a stupid clip like that I'll take it you know what we need is the ABCs that's what we need in our lives the ABCs if we can get the ABCs straight in our lives brothers and sisters a lot of the problems won't even be problems we won't have the issues that we have but Satan gets in our way and throws these things they're distractions they're not necessarily sinful things but they're distractions we know that Paul said that all things are lawful but they're not all expedient they're not all going to help you and we can look at it now and say yeah you want to go and buy some pot it's legal you can go and buy some weed if you want it I'm sorry maybe I'm a little bit too bold from the pulpit but I'm just freaking real we live in a real world Once Upon a Time you could not buy alcohol but you can go and buy alcohol for decades now if we can get the ABCs right brothers and sisters just forget about the things that were in the past that's what Paul said forgetting the things that were in the past I press towards the mark for the prize of a high calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm not interested in in carrying somebody else's Grudge around I'm not interested in worrying about somebody else's problems I don't want to jump on somebody else's war wagon about their church and and how something should be a certain way and forget about it Look Away to Jesus if we can do that brothers and sisters it'll change our lives and you know the other thing we talked about I think it's so good because the Lord came and checked me with it are we are we forgetting are we choosing to forget are we choosing to forgive are we truly forgiving when situations happen in our lives or do we just keep that thing right there just in in you know a convenient pocket it's right there I forgive you but I'm just going to tuck that away and not look at it and you know you're forgiven it's cool we're talking about this but I haven't forgot it and you know what if you want to you can look up quotes to say brother Branham says you can forgive but you can't forget you can get that quote and you can put it up and you can put that in your pocket with it too and keep it there and use it and it's true right but have you truly forgiven if you're not willing to choose to forget I can promise you you can forget Satan will come around and try and remind you he'll come around and say oh no but don't you remember and you say yeah I remember but I choose to forget that because that's just gonna trip me up I'm going to think about that for the next 24 48 72 hours maybe a week maybe a month maybe a year I'll stew on that and and it'll me spiritually but when we choose to forget something Supernatural happens brothers and sisters that's pressing on towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we want all of our sin to be thrown where into the sea of God's remembrance right no no the Sea of his forgetfulness that's where we want our sin and that's what he said he would do and unless we're willing to forgive the way he forgives where do we stand but I just want to say I think that's like ABC stuff we've got to be willing to go over this and over this and over this and cultivate it and say Amen to it I want to be able to forgive I want to be able to forget if you want to be able to forgive and you want to be able to forget you can I think we've heard it said Henry Ford said it he said it well if you think you can you can if you think you can't you won't or you can't it's your choice but we have the ability and you know if you don't understand it maybe it sounds like I'm talking rubbish just ask God what brother Barry was saying is that true can I truly forget ask him I promise you he'll show you but I just want to throw it out there if you choose to forgive but not forget have we truly forgiven I just want to say this let's worry about ourselves lining up with God's word let's just throw out the trash in our lives brothers and sisters get rid of the trash it's only going to bring us down it's only going to mix us up it's only going to frustrate us it's only going to make us angry it's only going to do all these different things and it's just distractions in our lives that's all it is like we said many things are lawful but they're not Expedia they're not going to help us so I want to say it this way the things that we do the things that we read the things that we listen to our activities are they hindering us spiritually or are they helping us spiritually because one or the other thing is happening one of the other thing is happening we know that Paul said that even physical exercise it doesn't do anything for the for the spirit it's good for the flesh profitable for the flesh but nothing for the spirit but you know what one thing that I can say for sure is if you do get physical exercise you'll have energy and you'll have the desire to get up in the morning with a little bit of vigor because you've had some exercise but what he's talking about is what is what are you what are you making it is it your absolute is it something that comes before God is it an idol anything that we put before God is an idol it's idolatry let's just throw out the trash get rid of the idolatry and just spend more time with Jesus let's get the Dynamics in our lives because really honestly it's too late to play Church it's way too late to play Church remember we were I mentioned this I think last time or sometime recently what are you going to be thinking about what are you going to be doing when that time happens where are you going to be what are we going to be doing are we going to be asleep are we going to be at work are we going to be in a service like this we're going to be on a Prayer meeting we're going to be fellowshipping or are we going to be angry are we going to be fighting we're going to be backbiting we're going to be remembering because I'm right I know according to God's word I'm right are we going to be doing that what's going to happen we know that Jesus said am I going to find faith when I come back will I find faith in the earth when I come back and and I believe by the scripture that we've read in Ezekiel thus saith the Lord I'll pull you out of all of those Lambs all around the world and I'll bring you into your own land I'll bring you into the place where you will have the Holy Ghost you know what as a son and daughter of God whether you like it or not you're coming because he can't lose one part of his own and you know what brothers and sisters that doesn't make Grace a disgrace what it means is that those people who are actually misbehaviors around the word of God they'll get a spanking and they'll get in line and they'll all come we'll all come but the random in this message he talks about an old old Forest he talks about being out in the Northern British Columbia and I'm just going to tell the story briefly I don't have it as a quote here but he just tells the story about being out on a horse and he's he's hunting and he has his camera with him and I guess he wants to take a picture of a bear he's on the trail of a grizzly bear and he really wants to get a picture of the grizzly bear and the grizzly bear just doesn't want to give him a picture and he says he's on a horse that just wants to Buck the preacher a three-year-old horse a three or four-year-old horse that just wants to throw him off but he talks about this and excuse me how he goes off on his own and he does this from his Hunting Party and finds himself late in the day and he decides he better try and find his way back and how important sometimes it is to be able to find our way back we need to know what direction we have to go and he said you can talk about different ways to to find your orientation but he finds his bearing in the woods anyways and on this horse he winds up going the right way and gets to a place where he's just cresting a hill a mountain a pass maybe and and looking over the hill he can see the moon coming up and and he can see the forest down below and he says it's all Burnt Over Forest uh giant trees that had a forest fire sweep through and and take off all the limbs and now it's just stuck with all these trees giant trees with no limbs and he said well I was there I just you know you can imagine what it's like to be there in certain situations and I'm sure we all go through it to some extent where we say Lord why are we here and brother Brown says it in that message why am I here what what do you want me to see from this situation Lord and and he says you know while I was having that conversation with the Lord I heard this sound and it was the wind blowing I realized it was the wind blowing but it was kind of a spooky sound because it wasn't like a normal Forest and what he said was it was the wind blowing through all of the dead trees that wind was just blowing up the valley through those dead trees and it didn't make the sound that a normal wind blowing through a forest makes where it's a live Forest and he goes on to talk about how the the trees that are dead they they they they had the fire blow through they had the wind blow through but they just couldn't withstand it once upon a time it was a vibrant forest with with branches and bows and leaves and and twigs maybe and and as the wind blew through it would all move together and and he talks about it as trees giving praise unto God and rejoicing having a Revival in the forest and it's not easy or it's not difficult to actually do the comparison because we know in the Garden of Eden human beings men were listed as trees trees were referenced as people in the Garden of Eden we could get into that study later sometime but here we have the prophet of God having this this time where he's talking about it's not a vision he's just experiencing this the moon and and the Darkness coming on the wind blowing through and he says it was a spooky sound as the wind blew through that forest and then he says he can't help but think it's kind of like human beings when they get burnt over they have a Revival in their life but it's a flash in the pan and suddenly the trees are burnt over and the the sound of the Holy Ghost blowing through the room causes a spooky sound because they're just stationary trees they can't move with the moving of the spirit they're too starchy in their ways he said it's a spooky sound don't let it be a spooky sound in your lives brothers and sisters let it move the bows let it let it go don't worry about what other people are thinking or or whatever it is that holds us back when the spirit of God wants to move say Amen Shout to the Lord Rejoice give him the glory because if we don't I believe he says we'll wind up like those trees where the wind will blow through and we'll just make a spooky sound boy I don't want to be one of those people I want to be free to move I want to see the Holy Spirit move in our midst I want to see our lives be flexible brother Adam tells the other story about how the trees when the wind blows what happens is the bows and the trees stretch and they move back and forth and what it does is it looks like they'll snap but they don't snap what it is is they're just stretching the holes for their roots to grow deeper and deeper and deeper and the more they Bend and bow the more their Roots grow down we have the ability to do that every single time we gather brothers and sisters every single struggle and trial in our lives is for a purpose it's to drive the roots deeper it's not to destroy us and blow us over but you know what if we don't give Glory when we should when we have the opportunity to our branches are going to shrivel up our wine Skins are going to dry out and what will happen is we'll make a spooky sound he said that if you don't cry out the rocks will immediately cry out I know we can say that some people will say my my nature is quiet I'm just quiet I'm not looking for sensationalism brothers and sisters I'm looking to see the maximum potential of the Holy Ghost and every single one of our Lives that's what I want to see the maximum potential of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here but brother Branham says that you know it makes a mournful sound as the wind blows through those dead spooky trees and he goes on to talk about this and he says you know I I know you'll probably be able to type it I won't even really say it but he says in the midst of all those old trees all those big old trees they've gone through many battles and probably many different bugs and many different famines many droughts things have happened in their lives and they made it to the point where they're all up there in in the stature and and then they wind up burnt up and spooky brother Branham says when that fire blew through there was seeds in those trees that cracked and fell to the ground and what happened was those seeds started to take life and even though those big tall ones they're spooky and they won't do much boy those little ones those little ones he said you could see it from where he was his vantage point with the light of the moon shining down through those trees he said you could see the little trees moving in the breeze those little trees were moving back and forth just having a Revival of their own even in the midst of all of the other ones that are are dried up and gone the live Forest has a totally different sound brothers and sisters than an old one something that that can't worship anymore dead trees they just don't bend they're not flexible at all and brother Branham he types that as a type of the church going on in this in this message he says what does it take to to make a Christian Life that's the message so we paragraph 29 he says and so I I noticed when the winds fell the old tree moaned but the little tree had a Revival it just jumped and went around and around and around and flashed around shouting and praising the Lord when have you ever seen a tree jump and run around it just jumped and went around and round and round and flashed around shouting and praising the Lord and I thought well there's something we might say it might not have the education that the old ones got it may be green but it's flexible so that's what God was doing and I noticed it in an experience with God how it likes to shake his trees loosen them up and every time a tree moves and shakes it pulls the roots and makes them grow loose so they can grow down and get a better hold not destroy them isn't that beautiful now the Lutheran left what the Lutheran had left has the Methodist eaten with the Methodist left the Baptist eaten what the Baptist left the Presbyterian scene with the Presbyterians left the nazarines the nazarenes left Pentecostals eaten just before this in the message he he talks about the the Palmer worm the canker worm the Locust and and the Palmer worm I believe it is or the Palmer worm and the locus but he talks about all the different denominations here what the Presbyterians left the nazarenes eating with the nazarenes left the Pentecostals eaten but I will restore saith the Lord I will restore then God in his great move of the spirit is coming to restore that's his word brothers and sisters I would say expect it and you know we're not looking for a great world wild wide Revival there's many people that are prophesying that that's happening and that's gonna happen you know what's been happening since 1960s when the seals were open there has been a Revival and it's the bride's Revival and that Revival is right in line with the word of God it's not off on some other denominational Doctrine he goes on to say in this message how many times under enthusiasm and if you'll watch the life that it Bears talking about the Holy Spirit talking about the new spirit in people's lives if you'll watch the life that it Bears what life does it bear he says I hope I'm not hurting but I hope I'm uncovering and I thought oh my I don't want to read that I don't really want to say it but you know what brothers and sisters we're here to be Tried by the word of God the the house of the Lord is a house of correction all of us need to be corrected and if we can't be corrected that we're not Sons and Daughters of God he says I hope I'm not hurting I'm uncovering see a lot of times you think that you have the Holy Spirit oh said I some I spoke in tongues certainly being that close to it you might do all of that but that isn't the holy spirit yet see the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ and I just can't help but stop there and say what I've always said and what I always will say maybe it makes people groan I really don't mean to do it but I think it's just so important what was Jesus like when he was here was he sitting down and saying that we need to study and we need to learn and we need to understand and we need to to be educated and we need to understand all of this and when you're done you'll actually be ordained you'll get a certificate of recognition because you've passed the exam no that's not what he told Simon Peter he said to Simon Peter Flesh and Blood hath not revealed that unto you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed that unto you and Upon This Rock we know Revelation is what I'll build my church on not not not a study your way into it it's not an understanding intellectually and remember at the beginning he talked about the intellectuals we got to push those aside we got to get away from the intellectuals and get into the the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost in our lives but he says that is in the holy spirit yet see the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ so once again I'll say it what was Jesus like when he was here we know that the word of God says that he was meek but that doesn't mean he was weak he was strong he went to Calvary how many people could pick up that cross and walk up that road and go to to the cross for all of the sins of man how many could just remain dumb as a as a lamb before his sheer as people buffeted him and pulled out his beard hair and spit on him and and smacked him in the head and said prophesy and tell us who did that how many of us could just remain silent through all of that he did how was Jesus when he was here the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ I just think it's beautiful because we can look at all of the different examples I'm not going to bring a whole bunch of them today but you know what I'm talking about all of the sinful nature of people that's who Jesus put himself with that's who Jesus went to he didn't go to the the smart and and shiny most religious people he went to the people who were in need he went to the Sinners and the publicans he went to the people that were ignorant and unlearned those are the people that he went to so so the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters it Bears record of Jesus Christ I'm not trying to say that Jesus Christ is looking for ignorance what I'm saying is Jesus Christ is looking for people that bear record of his spirit and his Spirit he talks about it there's fruit of the spirit and I'm so thankful we were taught that the fruit of the spirit it's not fruits it's not a multiple thing where you can just go to the grocery store of the word and say I'll just take one of these fruits and I'll just take some forgiveness and and I'll just take some long-suffering and I'll put those in my bag no no no no no no no no the spirit of Jesus Christ has the fruit it's all one thing they all come together it's a package deal it's a bunch of fruit that grows on the same tree we cannot have the Holy Spirit and not have that whole bundle of fruit the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ I can see here though with just that that sentence right there the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ you could easily take that and make that two persons you could easily take it and make it two separate uh of the three and and remain just sort of nebulous about about God he's not really in there but we know we're speaking of God when we talk about this the Holy Spirit God Bears record of Jesus Christ God it's not different people it's not different things it's not different places it's one God paragraph 33 he says now he taken and what did he do give you a new heart give you a new spirit and then he puts his spirit his Spirit In You I just can't help but think brothers and sisters when we understand this how easy is it to worship how easy is it to come in and just just worship you know I I we were at a volleyball tournament this weekend for the boys we live in a real world and they're playing volleyball with school but I was talking to them sometimes we need to maybe have a little bit of self-talk in our lives and maybe this would work spiritually I couldn't help but think as I was watching this maybe this would help spiritually there's there's certain things that we can do in our lives that will help us and I know the song leader has a certain thing that they'll do when they want to warm up their voice and I'm not going to do it now I'll let them demonstrate it for you sometime if they desire but they warm up they get into it they get into the spirit of it and I was talking about in in the volleyball in the game and those people who have played Sports here they probably fully understand what I'm talking about you don't start the game after you get there on the court and the ball is first sir if you start the game when you're going to bed the night before when you're waking up in the morning when when you're getting ready to go out the door when you're eating your breakfast you're in the game you're visualizing what's going to happen I can't help but think when we come to church are we still yawning and waking up and singing that song I'm so glad remember I said that that I can say I'm one of what a what if we sing it like that what are you so glad of but if you're one of them that brother Bradham came to remind that God pulled you from before the foundation of the world from his son if you're one of them that you never did anything about it from the beginning you just never did it from the start he came to remind you of that one of them oh my I'm one of them that's redeemed that he's going to give a new heart to he's going to place his own heart within me I'm one of them goodness sakes I can't help but think that's that's enough to shout brothers and sisters to run around the building but if we can recognize what he's done for us my goodness because he says this now he taken and what did he do give you a new heart give you a new spirit and then he puts his Spirit his Spirit In You he's done it all it's just like you don't have to go around and pretend that you're a Christian man that new spirit brings new life the holy spirit in your new spirit in your new heart your new heart your new spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in the center of your new spirit and your new spirit goes right in the center of your new heart and you can't interact in this world without people seeing there's something different about you you don't even have to say it you don't even have to tell people I'm a Christian people will just stop swearing and they'll apologize for swearing in your presence and it's not because your presence is there it's because you have another spirit in you you bring another presence to the party you bring Jesus Christ himself and you know what happens all those evil spirits that are around we're not saying people are evil we're saying the spirits are evil all those evil spirits they recognize it isn't it just like in Jesus day if you zoom out for a sec in Jesus day the most religious people they call him Beelzebub didn't they oh because you believe the message for your day your Beelzebub but the Devils they're the ones that cried out and said oh no son of David have mercy on us don't don't send us out before our time they were able to recognize who it was the son of man was present with them it's the same thing today Spirits don't die Jesus never died the only thing that he did was he laid down the body of Flesh and he went down into hell and took the keys of death and hell off of the side of Satan and said you know what you're defeated you probably knew that you were somewhere along the way you know brother Branham he tells the story and says oh Satan was waiting for him to be knocking at the door and he said oh I knew you were coming now I got you and what did he do he grabbed him by the throat and said no you don't got me I got you I got you the most intellectual intelligent being ever created ever to be created I got you the holy spirit in your new spirit in your new heart your new heart your new spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in the center of your new spirit and your new spirit goes right in the center of your new heart and you know brothers and sisters this can sound really convoluted and and confusing and I don't want it to be that way especially where we have children because there's children present that are listening to me and I know parents are probably going to say what's brother Barry talking about why are my children coming to me asking questions but it's important for us to understand these things that we can in fact get to a place where we think that everything is okay and it's not okay because why because our spirit our spirit beareth witness with his spirit and his Spirit beareth witness with our spirit where together we're United we're in accord we're not fighting ourselves we're not in in torment we're not angry one day and happy the next day we're not up today and down tomorrow we're we're stable brother Adam talks about the believer being solid and and and just ReSound not not being up or down we know that it's a false teaching for us to be saved today and lost tomorrow that's the devil he crept into the church and and that's the teaching it makes it lukewarm formal empowerless people come to the place where they say I can't live it so why would I even try there's no way that I can ever just maybe wear the dresses that that females wear or or not cut my hair like the word of God says or or or do whatever the word of God says there's no way that I can ever do it and you're 100 right as a human being when you say that there's no way that a human being can ever behave that way but you know what you get his spirit if you can get the holy spirit in your life if you can start with getting a new spirit because that's what he'll do is give you a new spirit then he'll place his heart within you when when you just take the steps that he's asking to do only believe that's really the only thing we have to do if we can do that then he will actually do it all the word of God says that he will do it all we don't do any of it only thing that we do is believe it because he said it but I just can't help but think just maybe turn with me to Romans chapter 8. the spirit itself it Bears witness of what Spirits inside of us so it's not just brother Berry saying you know this sounds good it's fantastic I just want to make sure that we're we're bringing it back to the word we're saying what the prophet said we're saying what the word of God said this isn't just something that we're trying to Cobble together and make it sound fantastic the spirit itself beareth witness if you read from verse 14 it says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God if we're willing to be led by the spirit of God how could you be led by the spirit of God if you don't get the Holy Ghost in your life come to church this is where deceit can happen you can hear preaching and if you don't have the spirit of God in your life somebody can come and tell you whatever they want to and you won't know whether it's right or not and you know what it's going to be so close that it would deceive the very elective if possible Satan is very cunning he's very interested in coming to church he came to church with Adam and Eve he came and gave her one word off that's what caused the entire fall one word off he's going to use the word he's not just going to come as a raging monster his Spirit beareth Witness for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God verse 15. sometimes we get hurt in our lives but brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost in our lives and this verse will come alive for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear if we're afraid it's a spirit of bondage if we can't just let go and let the Holy Ghost have his way in our lives because of whatever because of a fear it's a spirit that's trying to hold us back the spirit is just trying to hinder us to us from going on to realize who we are but if we can get beyond that if we recognize that if we have fear in our lives we can say I rebuke you spirit of fear in the name of Jesus Christ because that's not what the word of God says the word of God says but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we come to church on time and we want to worship Him and cry Abba Father because we recognize what he's done for us the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God we don't have to tell people that I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God we don't have to go around and say I'm a Christian don't say that I'm a Christian don't do that we just have to be there we just have to live our lives and his spirit will bear witness with our spirit verse 17 says and if if children then heirs doesn't matter it's okay you can have it all I don't need the best part of the deal go ahead take it all take all the money off the table make it yours because that's all you're ever going to get because I know that I'm an heir and my father owns it all so it's fine you can go ahead if children than heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time they're not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed where in US if we can just believe you know not get stuck in Romans chapter 7. Romans chapter 7 oh I want to do good and evil is present and every time I try to do good evil abounds oh my who can save me from this flesh that I am what a Wretched Man I am yes we are on our own but remember Turn the Page go to Romans chapter 8. and read verse one there is therefore now not tomorrow not some time out in the future there's therefore right now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's why brothers and sisters we got to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're going to be anchored in Jesus it's not just being anchored in a church it's not just being anchored in a tradition or a theology it's being anchored in him when the Devil comes around and tries to plant thoughts in our mind which he's going to do every single second of every single minute of every single hour of every single day of every single week of every single month of every single year as long as we're hearing this flash Satan is going to come and give us thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts he's going to know the genetic weaknesses of our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents and he's going to continually barrage us with thoughts and we have to take every single one of those thoughts into captivity of the word outside of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives how would we ever do it if we think about how much pressure there is in this age we've got the screen in our hand brother Branham talked about them duping us how Satan did it to us and he brought in the picture shows and people can't really contain themselves with the picture shows I remember when we would be going to church Downtown Calgary on Wednesday nights or Sunday nights it was typically Sunday nights maybe sometimes on Saturdays we'd be driving down Memorial Drive right past the Firestone Tower there Barlow Trail we'd be going around there and there was a drive-in theater there when I was a kid he was on the north side of the road on the right side and you'd just be able to see downtown Calgary and at night time you'd be able to see a screen like this and and you'd be coming down the road and it would just sort of be there but it was captivating this big screen and I would always be looking to see if I could just catch a glimpse just a little bit of some kind of a movie something and why is that brother Branham said it when they pulled the lid of hell off in Hollywood he said they they thought you know we can't escape it they they brought in the picture show and people can't escape that idea but he said you know what they did what Satan did he brought in the television he brought out that television and it tells a vision all right but you know we thought that was maybe at a time that was the greatest thing and it was the greatest thing for a while but then I remember when I was young they were talking about something called the information superhighway and we know it as the internet now but that information superhighway has come in now and you can actually have the video conference with someone in your from your pocket in your hand you can actually pull out your phone and we've all got those devices we're all subject to the barrage of Satan and you know wouldn't it be nice if we could just have maybe what some people have called the truth Network and all of us who are believers just have a believer's maybe cell phone company where all we see is is Believers information that's all it's only positive it's only the word it's only our Believers it's only scripture you know that's not going to happen because we live in Satan's Eden we have got to guard ourselves we have got to guard gird up the loins of our mind we've got to make sure that we're on guard put on the whole armor of God every single day we've got to buckle it down but brothers and sisters when we look at our lives and we see all these things these Temptations these problems I reckon that the sufferings of this present time they're not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us one of these days we're going to see their loved ones that went on before us and we're going to say my my oh my here we are finally it came this is what we've all been waiting for this is what we've preached our hearts out about this is what we've prayed earnestly for this is what we've taught our children about this is what we've talked to our neighbors about this is what we have desired our whole entire lives and all the people went to the Grave not knowing not being able to see this but we are those chosen ones I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them how will we sing it their brothers and sisters why because that glory is going to be revealed in US because we're going to take on a new body brother Branham he takes another example in this message he says so it's like a mainspring and a famous watch and it's self-winding all right now we've got different watches now but I think some of the really good ones they're still self-winding and and some of them you even still need to whine but they have a mainspring they're really good watches and it's self-winding he says all right it sets right in the middle of that new spirit and the mainspring of a famous watch sets in the middle of the watch and makes every organ of that watch every little instrument tick just perfectly to time it's all done by a main spring and the little works out on the side move with this main spring it's the wheel in the middle of the wheel as Ezekiel said it just is perfectly balanced and it's perfectly timed and if we can just look at our lives and recognize we don't need to get fussed brothers and sisters we don't need to get upset we just need to recognize they were all those little parts of working around that main spring his will is actually making it tick his will is keeping it going it's his word in our lives and as long as we can line up with his word we will have success we will see him move in our lives you know I just think it's almost unbearable when we think about how we there's no way that we can actually how do we how do we take every single thought into captivity as we talked about a couple minutes ago how do we do that there's no way humanly possible that we can take every thought but the word says take every thought into captivity I just think it's got to become that subliminal it's it's a subconscious thing brother random talks about it in this message it has to be a subconscious thing it has to come to that place where we just don't even reason it we just say nope that's not God's word nope that's not God's word nope that's not God's word and because it's not God's word I'm just going to dismiss it I'm just going to dismiss it I'm just going to dismiss it if somebody says something to us that's not God's word we're not looking for a fight we don't want to fight with them we'll just simply dismiss it and say God bless you I'm not going to go there I'm just not willing to enter into that I'm just going to dismiss it and go forwards but I'm not going to have a bitter battle I'm not going to jump on a war wagon and say oh I've got something to prove I've got to straighten this person out on their Doctrine it's all done by the mainspring well the problem just uses a simple example it's just done by the mainspring it's done by the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it's done by the spirit of Christ this whole entire world is happening according to the will of God every single part of it every single facet of it nothing is happening outside of God knowing about it and allowing it you believe that this morning because if we think that something happens and it's outside of God's understanding then he's not God but every single thing that's happening is for a reason and you know it's all working together for the good for a certain group of people not for everyone sometimes it's said all things work together for the good period That's not the scripture the scripture says to those who were called according to his purpose those are the ones that it's working together for the good for and the other people it's terrible but it's true it might not be working together for the good for them but what does it take to make a Christian Life brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost what does it take to make your Christian Life it's not Church attendance it's not it's not tenure I've been in the message for however many years that doesn't do it what does it take to make a Christian Life truly surrender unto the Lord Jesus Christ surrender unto the word of God for our day get the Holy Ghost in our lives and then all of these other things will be added unto us I just heard a brother say it one time you know he caught the revelation of tithing and and I don't want to talk about tithing I'm going to have somebody else come and talk about tithing I could talk about it I mean it's scriptural and I have no reason to not talk about it but I just don't want people thinking that I'm trying to you know encourage it or whatever it can be such a sticky subject because you know the love of money is the root of all evils what the word of God says and people get so fussy over money I don't want to go there too much but money is an interesting thing it's a tool that's designed to be used by US and to work for us that's what money is but sometimes people get a revelation about tithing and and they recognize wait a second there's a blessing there for me if I tithe and and the blessing isn't because you're a active member of the society or whatever I'm not going that way with it I'm saying that the word of God opens up supernaturally spiritually for those people who catch that Revelation but where I'm going with all this is to say this I heard a brother say one time there was a guy in another church somewhere else he caught the revelation of tithing and you know what he could not wait to get his paycheck is what this this pastor was saying every single time he got his paycheck he when he first had this Revelation he would run to the bank cash the check and run to the church like Friday afternoon Saturday morning and want to pay his tithes because there was a blessing in store for him for that tithing and you know I just can't help but think many times we we look at that and it might be once a month it might be twice a month it could be however many times that's that's everybody else's personal private business between you and God but what I want to say is put the tithing aside and think about the worship he's not interested in your money he's interested in your worship that's what he's truly interested in and that's what Satan's trying to gobble up if he can distract us then he's taken away the worship but what if you were able to just push the tithing aside and say I know that there is a tremendous spiritual blessing for me to be able to give him that worship that he desires when I worship Him Something Happens something changes something Supernatural takes place in the service something Supernatural takes place in my prayer meeting in my home in my living room when I worship God God comes on the scene and you know brothers and sisters that's really the best blessing that we could ever get is just to give God all the worship of Our Lives the fruit of our lips to be able to express to him his word to say that I'm so thankful that you called me from before the foundation of the world to recognize what he's done for us I just think tithing is such a minor thing and some people might say well brother bear you might not think so if you weren't taking your wage from it and you know maybe but if I had to get a job I would we could get a job it's work it's fine and then you know what I get that blessing of tithing and I'll say this too in this position I still get the blessing of tithing because I still tithe I tithe on what I take but I also tithe on what the church takes the church tithes because there's a blessing in it what does it take to make a Christian Life paragraph 34 brother Branham says now when you receive the Holy Spirit it goes right in the middle of that new dispen disposition of yours oh you say I quit drinking I quit smoking you know I I I just feel like a different person oops wait a minute see you just got a new spirit but the Holy Spirit comes in the middle of that spirit and then he makes you every main motion every intellectual everything agreeing right into the middle of the wheel what God says that's true if the days of Miracles if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit would bear record with that and every intellectual move of yours would say the same thing we wouldn't get hung up on things we wouldn't get sidetracked with situations and and problems we would just follow the word of God and say you know I just trust that he has this all under control this is his his business it's not mine we don't run the church like a business but what I'm saying is it's his interest it's not necessarily his business this is this is his and he'll do with it what he wants what does it take to make a Christian Life and when you have these little temper fits and you fly out and you tell lies and you proselyte and you jump fences and you so selfish with your organization that you're so narrow-minded you couldn't hear another minister just remember the Holy Spirit isn't ticking in the inside of you I think this is so important brothers and sisters this is the prophet of God speaking these words and further to that I would say because we can just put it off and say wow it's just a man he's saying it maybe he had faults maybe he made mistakes some people might say well the prophet of God he was only Human After All no I'll say it this way this is God speaking to man through the Prophet this is God's word this is the Holy Ghost speaking if you believe that God sent a Prophet this is under inspiration he's talking these words so people get it he says that if you have this if you're so narrow-minded you couldn't hear another Minister well the word of God says that it's the fivefold ministry that will do the perfecting of the Saints is it not it truly is it's not just one minister it's not just one guy somewhere maybe a few and we know that we've heard people say it in the past that there's only this many you know however many fingers you can hold up ordain people or or anointed people in the end time to be able to bring the gospel that's that's a lie of the devil he says just remember the Holy Spirit isn't ticking inside of you I I don't know I was going to say that but that's all right see and if you hear him say that you can see he's even a little surprised that he said it I believe it's important for us to recognize it we need to know if we don't have the right attitude it's not the right spirit and the only reason I would say for the most part because I believe we've all got the Holy Ghost I'm not saying that we're talking to people that don't have the Holy Ghost I want to speak the prophet of God said that you will never live higher than your confession you'll never live above your confession so if I go start saying well I believe there's some people here today they just don't have the Holy Ghost and we need to you know maybe have a prayer meeting and we need to get down to the root of things and start belittling people no way it's not up to me to say that it's up to me to encourage everyone to get to that finish line to get across that goal line to say I have scored a touchdown I know that I know that I know I don't have to worry I don't have to wonder I got that eternal security in my life I know that I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption I'm not saved today and lost tomorrow I know I've got the holy ghost in my life that's what I'm trying to to do brothers and sisters who encourage us to recognize that the holy spirit will make every movement like Christ it'll make you christ-like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions brings it back to a flesh part a flesh level a carnal reason a space that we can maybe comprehend but it's our emotions those are the things that the Holy Spirit controls our emotions our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down I love how he says this you could do that a shindig will bring that to you remember there's people that went to The Beatles concerts and got healed because of an inspiration that was happening there just because we get a healing doesn't mean it's the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters brother Bradham talks about many people coming in the prayer line getting getting healed getting healed getting healed and lost tomorrow it doesn't matter if we get healed in our bodies this body has to perish one way or the other we're not going to take this body with us says you could go do that a ship day will bring that out in you but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace in love and in Joy with long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness and patience you see it isn't something that you do it's something the Holy Spirit does in you he says you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit oh I wish I could shout the Praises of God around the world to that isn't that beautiful turn with me quickly in your Bibles we still have 10 minutes left let's go to First Corinthians First Corinthians 15. we live in these natural bodies and many times well I would say every day it feels like I fail every day I have to fight those thoughts but those are the same thoughts not just that maybe there's something about a brother or there's this or there's that I would say they're probably the most important thoughts is to recognize our self-talk about ourselves because we fall we fall we fall that doesn't change Who We Are remember the story that that I told you brother Wayne said in Saskatoon it was beautiful he called a young brother up and he said what's your name he said I think it was David and he said fall down so he fell down he said get back up what's your name is David fall down get back up what's your name David what's your dad's name Joe he said is your falling down change your name nope did your falling down change your dad's name nope doesn't change us the only thing we do is we trip when we fall and when we're training a child to walk we help them think about how the Lord watches over his children when we're truly his children he grabs us he doesn't let us fall on our face sometimes we do trip and fall and sometimes we need a little bump here and there but for the most part he saves us from our our bruises and he saves us from our pains but brothers and sisters this this body that we live in is not going to go where we're going you're not seeing the real me I'm not seeing the real you let's start reading with uh First Corinthians 15 verse 41. there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it's sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it's sown in weakness it's raised in power as we read this brothers and sisters I want to remind us I want to I want to just emphasize this the word of God says that it's going to be exactly the way we're living right now we're going to be contending with this flesh it's sown in dishonor verse 43 it's raised in glory it's sown in weakness it's raised in power it's sown in a natural body it is raised in a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it's written the first Adam man first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit Glory how be it that was not the first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth Earthly the second man is the Lord From Heaven the man that we have is earthy this flesh is earthy and it's going to be earthy all the way through brothers and sisters but if we can get the Holy Ghost we're going to stop looking at this flesh that's the difference we're going to stop looking at this flesh and we're going to start looking at the promise and maybe this is only for me today I don't know but I just can't help but think about Romans 8 5 and 6 here Romans 8 5 and 6. I'll just read it quickly for us for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things that are flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit remember we read that the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit when we look around and we see people they're busy minding the the fleshy things in this world What Spirit influence are they under verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly just like he said he will take you out of the Nations he will give you a place to live and then he'll take and put a new spirit within you and then he'll take your old heart out and then he'll put a new heart in you he'll do that operation all on his own we shall bear the image of the heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God so why don't we stop trying to make it like this flesh should this flesh will never inherit the kingdom of God ever but I know Satan comes around and says oh look at you you fell you know how are you ever going to make it there well I'm not this flesh is not it's the Inner Man the second Adam that life of Jesus Christ inside that is now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality isn't that beautiful that's his word declaring that it is going to happen it must happen nothing will stop his word from coming to pass that means that our flesh will be put off this corruption that we deal with will actually be put down and we will be transformed into a new glorious body into incorruption the only thing that we're going to take is his character with us that's what's going to happen it'll be his character that takes us for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so whether it's corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory and I want to say this this morning brothers and sisters as we live this message of the hour as we fill our cups every time we come to Service as we worship God as we spend time with the Lord as we believe this message of the hour and we eat the book just like John was instructed death is being swallowed up in Victory it's not just one event that's going to happen it's that process of the Rapture and what's happening is the rapture is swallowing up death because eventually these bodies will give forth and we'll have a new glorious body that's going to happen and you know what will happen it'll say death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting and Grave where is thy victory I know we've talked about in the past brother Branham he says it you know we're afraid of dying most people are afraid of death this body is afraid of death the old man this incorruption this corruption rather is afraid to die he doesn't want to stop living it it's just nature of the human being of the animal but you know what it has to and when we choose to lay it down ourselves when we choose to say just be it unto me according to Thy word Lord let this body die out so that you can live then then we no longer have fear because what happens if we die what's the worst that can happen oh you're gonna die we're gonna die but guess what we live we become more alive than we've ever been because we believe we don't lose we win Satan wants to make us think we lose oh my you're gonna die ah you're gonna get a terrible disease or you're going to have an accident or something awful is going to happen in your life yeah sure it's terrible that's tragic but we can look at Believers and say they're more alive today who have gone on before us than they ever were here but if we could look Satan in the face and say you know what I'm not afraid to die where is thy sting and Grave where is your Victory you've got none there's nothing that you can do because we can say but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] and it just draws it back full circle I'll call the musicians well we close today but it just brings it back full circle it's Jesus Christ Living out through us the only way he does that is to get the Holy Ghost in our lives verse 58 says therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord if you're doing something for the lord it's not in vain our labor is not in vain for the Lord he's he's watching every move that we make remember therefore maybe stand with me as we close therefore say thus saith the Lord God speaking to Ezekiel therefore say thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel I'll say it I'll give you the Holy Ghost and they shall come hither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the Abominations thereof from thence and I will give them a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and we'll give them a heart of Flesh I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters this isn't out there somewhere in the future this is happening right now this very moment every single day that we live on this side of Eternity if we are willing to Humble ourselves to the word of God say maybe I don't understand it but I believe it so long as we're willing to do that to have an open heart to have the right attitude brother Adam said the God said through brother Brown of the right mental attitude towards any one of the promises of God will bring it to pass in our lives if we want more of God there's more of God to have if we're willing to take him at his word and just say be it unto me according to Thy word he will come and he'll take away the detestable things he'll take away the Abominations thereof and he will give them one heart he'll give you a new heart he'll give you a new spirit he'll place his Spirit within God bless you this morning let's just bow Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us we
