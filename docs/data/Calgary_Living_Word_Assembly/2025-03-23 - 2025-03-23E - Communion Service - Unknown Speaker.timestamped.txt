[42:55] and then we'll just get on with the
[42:56] service I don't plan to preach a storm
[42:58] tonight I just want a little exhortation
[43:01] here about what we're doing it's not
[43:05] because we just had a man that came on
[43:08] the scene who had a a spiritual gift in
[43:11] his life who is a prophet to this age
[43:15] that some people would call it's not
[43:18] just because he said this it's because
[43:19] there's a scriptural identification that
[43:21] we do this that's the reason we gather
[43:24] this way amen and St John 6 starting
[43:30] with verse
[43:31] 47 Jesus contending with the most
[43:34] religious folks of the
[43:37] day he says verily verily I say unto you
[43:40] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[43:44] life amen but we know that wasn't just
[43:47] enough was it no we had to go a little
[43:50] farther right and he identified what we
[43:53] needed to do he said I am that bread of
[43:55] life your fathers did eat Mana in the
[43:58] wilderness and are dead and we know the
[44:02] prophet in our day he told us very
[44:04] clearly that that didn't mean that they
[44:06] just actually died went into the ground
[44:09] and were waiting for the resurrection it
[44:11] meant that they had nothing in their
[44:13] heart to mix with that word when it came
[44:15] through the Vindicated Prophet which
[44:17] meant Eternal separation that they were
[44:20] dead
[44:21] forever that's what that meant your
[44:24] fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness
[44:26] they were religious
[44:27] but yet they are dead they are
[44:29] experiencing Eternal separation he said
[44:32] this is the bread which cometh down from
[44:35] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[44:39] not
[44:41] die I am isn't that beautiful yes amen I
[44:45] am once again the living bread which
[44:49] came down from heaven If any man shall
[44:51] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[44:55] and the bread that I will give is my
[44:59] flesh which I will give for the life of
[45:02] the
[45:03] world the Jews therefore strove amongst
[45:06] themselves saying how can this man give
[45:09] us of his flesh to
[45:11] eat then Jesus said unto them verily
[45:14] verily I say unto you except ye eat the
[45:17] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[45:20] blood ye have no life in you you could
[45:23] imagine this was pushing them over the
[45:25] edge now yeah and he was fully intending
[45:30] to who so eateth my flesh and drinketh
[45:33] my blood hath eternal
[45:36] life and I will raise him up at the last
[45:39] day am for my flesh is meat indeed and
[45:43] my blood is drink
[45:46] indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[45:49] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[45:52] in
[45:53] him as the living father hath sent me
[45:57] and I live by the
[45:59] father so he that eateth
[46:02] me even he shall live by me
[46:07] Hallelujah this is the bread which came
[46:10] down from heaven not as your fathers did
[46:13] eat mana and are
[46:16] dead he that eateth of this bread shall
[46:20] live forever amen God bless you tonight
[46:23] you may be
[46:24] seated may he had a blessing to the
[46:27] reading of his word I think it's just
[46:29] beautiful how how strong how Stern how
[46:34] straight that he was preaching this to
[46:37] those people this this was Abomination
[46:40] to them according to the law and it
[46:43] really was a gift for the people who
[46:45] were able to see what was going on yes
[46:48] they were able to understand this is
[46:49] something different there's a corner
[46:51] being turned here it was a change of
[46:52] dispensations we know
[46:55] that but Jesus being God in flesh the
[46:59] word had come and now was telling them
[47:02] you need to eat his flesh and drink his
[47:04] blood it was completely against the law
[47:08] of Moses they weren't even allowed to
[47:11] touch a dead body of an animal or a
[47:15] human without a purification process so
[47:19] now he's talking in such a crazy way how
[47:22] on Earth could they ever eat his flesh
[47:25] and drink his blood we know that some
[47:26] people people said now he's talking
[47:27] about being a vampire we know that some
[47:30] people even after the resurrection they
[47:32] said well they went in and they what he
[47:34] was talking about was going in and
[47:35] cutting off pieces of his flesh and
[47:37] actually eating it and and getting a
[47:38] little bit of that blood as well there's
[47:41] all kinds of doctrines of
[47:44] devils but what a tremendous thing it is
[47:46] for him to talk this way in such a way
[47:50] that's so crazy and so out there how
[47:54] could that possibly be I just can't help
[47:56] but think it's no different today and
[47:58] the word of God says that he is the same
[48:00] yesterday today and forever why would he
[48:01] behave any differently today than he did
[48:04] then when he was there in flesh telling
[48:07] him something so crazy what happened in
[48:10] sainia
[48:12] Canyon a sword hit his hand many times
[48:15] people would say yeah I don't know I
[48:16] can't really get my head wrapped around
[48:18] that part that's a bit out there a
[48:21] little bit fictitious what
[48:23] was the uh what happened on Sunset
[48:26] Mountain what was the attraction on the
[48:27] mountain what was that the cloud the
[48:30] pyramid Cloud what was that what really
[48:33] took place what was really taking place
[48:36] I want to read a quote tonight out of
[48:38] the unveiling of God and I'm going to
[48:40] bounce back and forth between the
[48:42] scripture and this quote just a little
[48:43] bit as I said I'm not going to preach
[48:45] too long because I want to make sure we
[48:47] have enough time to not be pressured for
[48:49] testimonies maybe a little singing just
[48:52] to be able to maybe get home at a decent
[48:55] time I want to be respectful but hey if
[48:57] the spirit wants to move also we
[48:59] certainly don't want to try and limit
[49:01] God in any way we just want to be
[49:02] flexible remember if we're too rigid
[49:06] we're bound to get bent out of
[49:08] shape 1964 the unveiling of God brother
[49:11] bradam he says this now my subject this
[49:14] morning right at the very beginning of
[49:15] this one remember it's the unveiling of
[49:18] God 1964 after the seals are open after
[49:22] the sword struck is everything has
[49:23] already happened now it's just living in
[49:26] the glow of this ministry here he's just
[49:28] continually bringing the word the the
[49:31] unadulterated entirety of the word to
[49:34] the people the unveiling of God he says
[49:36] now my subject this morning I trust that
[49:38] God will reveal this it can't be a man
[49:41] that reveals it it's got to be him that
[49:44] reveals it I trust that God will reveal
[49:47] this and each time if you who take the
[49:51] tapes and
[49:52] listen and I hope and trust that you
[49:55] have a spiritual understanding of what
[49:58] that God has been trying to get over to
[50:01] the church without saying it
[50:04] outright isn't that
[50:07] interesting what was he getting over to
[50:09] the people here unless you eat my flesh
[50:12] and you drink my blood you have no life
[50:14] in you he was talking about an event
[50:17] that was going to take
[50:19] place but they had no idea no ability no
[50:23] capacity to even understand it except
[50:27] for a very very
[50:29] few except for a very few I love how he
[50:32] says this here I I hope and trust that
[50:35] you have a spiritual understanding of
[50:37] what that God has been trying to get
[50:40] over to the church without saying it
[50:42] right out wouldn't you think that he
[50:44] would just say it right out wouldn't it
[50:45] be so nice if he would just say it right
[50:47] out I remember as a kid thinking
[50:49] wouldn't it be nice if we could just be
[50:51] transformed into our glorious bodies and
[50:53] not have to go through all the struggle
[50:55] and strife that we have in this world
[50:57] wouldn't it be nice if we could do that
[51:00] it would be so
[51:01] nice but we would have power without
[51:05] character and we know that's
[51:07] satanic that is of the devil there has
[51:10] to be a character development in this
[51:12] flesh in in these Souls not this flesh I
[51:16] stand corrected carrying on in verse 59
[51:19] of John chapter six Jesus says these
[51:23] things or sorry these things said he in
[51:25] the synagogue as he taught in capernium
[51:29] verse 60 many therefore of his disciples
[51:32] when they heard this these were his
[51:34] disciples many of them when they heard
[51:37] this said this is a hard saying who can
[51:41] hear it remember he that hath an ear let
[51:45] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[51:47] church it's not this cartilage that
[51:49] continues to grow for our entire life
[51:52] it's not this it's this it's the ear
[51:55] inside our heart the ear inside our soul
[51:58] that he has given us before the
[52:00] foundation of the world this is a hard
[52:02] saying who can hear it when Jesus knew
[52:05] in himself that his disciples what oh my
[52:10] that thing again just like the fathers
[52:12] in the wilderness yeah murmured at it he
[52:16] knew they would but when he knew in
[52:18] himself that his disciples murmured at
[52:21] it he said unto them does this offend
[52:23] you my well try this
[52:27] if this offends you what an if ye shall
[52:29] see the son of man Ascend up where he
[52:31] was before Oh
[52:34] My it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[52:38] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[52:42] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[52:45] are
[52:47] life but there are some of you that
[52:49] believe not for Jesus knew from the
[52:52] beginning who they were that believed
[52:55] not and who should betray him can you
[52:58] imagine that what it must have been like
[53:00] for him as a man as a human being in all
[53:04] points tempted just like every one of
[53:07] us fellowshipping with the Brethren but
[53:11] knowing who is going to actually betray
[53:15] him
[53:17] my and he
[53:19] said therefore said I unto you that no
[53:23] man can come unto me except it were
[53:26] given given unto him of my
[53:30] father from that time many of his
[53:33] disciples went back and walked no more
[53:36] with him and then Jesus then said Jesus
[53:41] unto the twel will ye also go
[53:46] away so
[53:48] beautiful once again Simon Peter
[53:51] answered him Lord to whom shall we
[53:55] go that thou Hast the words of eternal
[53:58] life and we believe and are ass sure
[54:02] that thou art the Christ the son of the
[54:06] Living God and Jesus answered them have
[54:09] not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a
[54:14] devil he spake of judas's scariot the
[54:16] son of
[54:17] Simon for he it was that should betray
[54:20] him being one of the
[54:23] twel and we know that this is where the
[54:26] separating time happened 70 walked away
[54:29] they couldn't handle it there was
[54:31] nothing in them to mix with that word
[54:32] but they were his
[54:35] disciples but yet he didn't explain it
[54:37] brother bradam says it in the message he
[54:40] just didn't explain it there's things
[54:42] that he did that he did and there's
[54:44] things I believe that he does that he
[54:46] just doesn't explain and we know in our
[54:48] day this is what happened there was the
[54:49] first poll the second pole there's the
[54:51] explanation of the first poll there's
[54:52] the explanation of the second poll and
[54:54] we know the angel of the Lord met him
[54:55] and said listen you cannot explain this
[54:58] third poll that's coming your way I told
[54:59] you not to explain it not to try and
[55:02] explain it and what happened there was a
[55:04] whole bunch of impersonators that came
[55:06] up and he said that's all it takes it's
[55:07] just a bunch of ministers get a whole
[55:09] bunch of preachers together and there
[55:11] you go you got problems and that's what
[55:13] he encountered impersonators of this
[55:17] word but here we have it in our day in
[55:20] 1964 now my subject this morning I trust
[55:23] that God will will reveal this and each
[55:25] time if you who take the tapes and
[55:28] listen and I hope and trust that you
[55:30] have a spiritual understanding of what
[55:33] that God has been trying to get over to
[55:36] the church without saying it right out
[55:40] and you know this is a treacherous place
[55:43] I believe because this is where people
[55:46] will come in and try and say well this
[55:48] is what God was trying to say to the
[55:50] church I've got the Revelation I've got
[55:53] the edge unless you follow my Revelation
[55:57] you're going to actually miss the
[55:59] Rapture unless you do it the way that
[56:01] God has shown me through my tremendous
[56:04] Revelation remember the Bible says that
[56:06] the scripture is of no private
[56:09] interpretation and this man that we
[56:11] follow that people might say we follow
[56:13] William Mary and brandham this man
[56:16] pointed to the scripture this man
[56:18] pointed to Christ and this man said if
[56:20] you can't take my word for it take his
[56:22] word for it instead but I think it's
[56:25] just amazing this is what God has been
[56:27] trying to get over to the church without
[56:29] saying it outright and we know that
[56:31] after the second poll took place when he
[56:33] wouldn't explain it the people got upset
[56:36] they said oh he went off on his Doctrine
[56:38] didn't he talking about a sword talking
[56:40] about clouds picking him up talking
[56:42] about seven angels talking about the the
[56:46] the the Pyramid of angels talking about
[56:48] the seals being opened how could anybody
[56:51] have that Revelation how could anybody
[56:53] but the word of God says that someone
[56:55] will God God will reveal his mystery
[56:58] somewhere there's a time where the
[57:00] mystery of God will be finished amen as
[57:02] the as he has has declared according to
[57:06] his servants the prophets but here we
[57:08] have it in our day just like we saw back
[57:10] there in capernium something happened
[57:13] and God just never explained it
[57:15] perfectly clear did he he didn't send a
[57:17] complete diagnosis of exactly what
[57:20] happened he sent a prophet and some
[57:22] people had the ability to hear the voice
[57:24] of the Vindicated Prophet which is the
[57:25] voice of God and some people didn't but
[57:28] as it goes there's going to be more and
[57:30] more people falling away they're going
[57:32] to say man this is a hard thing oh my
[57:35] can't you give me a a better
[57:37] understanding can't can't we break it
[57:38] down can't we have some some good
[57:40] teachers that will teach us the Deep
[57:43] things you know what's going to take to
[57:45] teach us the Deep things is him Jesus
[57:48] Christ the Holy Ghost in our
[57:51] lives he says see it's a thing sometime
[57:55] we have have to say things in such a way
[57:58] that it might thin
[58:00] down it might bring some to go
[58:04] out some to leave now you might be
[58:08] saying brother Barry why you saying this
[58:10] this way because this is the prophet
[58:12] talking about it and sure enough the
[58:13] prophet's message was that way but you
[58:15] know what we're only going to say what
[58:16] the prophet said amen and if that is
[58:19] enough to actually cause people to go
[58:21] out I don't know what to say I can't
[58:24] help it we're only going to say what the
[58:26] the prophet said that's all we've said
[58:28] that's all we're going to say and if
[58:30] anything else is said then we need to
[58:31] have a conversation about it because we
[58:33] are duly bound as brothers as sisters we
[58:37] have got to make sure we keep each other
[58:39] in check if something is said that's
[58:40] incorrect we're we're duly bound to
[58:43] bring correction that's what the prophet
[58:45] said see it's a thing sometimes we have
[58:48] to say things in such a way that it
[58:50] might thin down it might bring some to
[58:52] go out some to leave and some to ponder
[58:55] over
[58:57] but that's done purposely he says it
[59:00] must be done that way now remember he's
[59:02] saying I trust that the spirit will
[59:04] reveal what God is trying to say to the
[59:07] church without saying it outright so
[59:09] this isn't even the prophet of God
[59:11] saying
[59:13] this then it might be that some would
[59:16] say you mean God would purposely do a
[59:19] thing like that he certainly
[59:23] did he does yet he says
[59:26] he said one day when he had thousands
[59:29] around him he said except you eat the
[59:30] Flesh of the Son of God or the son of
[59:33] man and drink his blood you have no life
[59:36] in you what kind of a statement do you
[59:39] think that a medical doctor or a nurse
[59:41] or any fine intellectual person would
[59:45] think of a statement like that for a man
[59:48] that had a Ministry like he
[59:51] had why he would say eat the flesh
[59:54] that's cannibal
[59:56] to drink human blood it's a
[59:59] vampire in other words he wants us to be
[1:00:01] cannibals and vampires that's what the
[1:00:04] carnal mind will do isn't
[1:00:06] it but the spiritual mind says Lord what
[1:00:10] do you want what are you trying to say
[1:00:13] what is it that you want to get across
[1:00:16] to the
[1:00:17] church and I know we're preaching to the
[1:00:19] choir here tonight because we all
[1:00:21] understand this I trust that we all
[1:00:23] understand this this is not about eating
[1:00:25] flesh and drinking blood this is about
[1:00:28] following the ordinance that he gave
[1:00:29] because we're going to read it in a
[1:00:30] little bit he sat down with his 12
[1:00:32] disciples before he went to Calvary to
[1:00:34] the Cross before he went to the garden
[1:00:37] and and actually won the victory by
[1:00:39] laying down his own will before he took
[1:00:42] the cat of nine taals 39 Stripes before
[1:00:46] all of that happened he sat down with
[1:00:48] his disciples and he had supper with him
[1:00:52] and when supper was ended he he while he
[1:00:55] had supper he took the wine and blessed
[1:00:57] it and he passed it around and said take
[1:00:59] drink of this this is my blood this is a
[1:01:02] new testament of my blood and and he
[1:01:05] gave the bread broke the bread gave it
[1:01:07] to them blessed it and said take eat
[1:01:09] this is my
[1:01:10] body it's broken for you for your sakes
[1:01:14] and they had no idea what he was talking
[1:01:16] about I think they might have been able
[1:01:18] to surmise a little bit at that point
[1:01:20] what was going to take place because of
[1:01:21] all the different statements that were
[1:01:22] made and maybe the conversations that
[1:01:24] were happening behind his back between
[1:01:27] the disciples but nobody really knew the
[1:01:31] impact the magnitude of what was really
[1:01:32] going to happen there but it's
[1:01:35] interesting because here he is telling
[1:01:37] the most religious people of the day
[1:01:39] unless you actually do this ordinance
[1:01:41] you have no life in me here we are today
[1:01:44] with the same ordinance here we are
[1:01:46] living under another Ministry a new
[1:01:49] testament if you will the third pole
[1:01:51] Ministry the opening of the word where
[1:01:53] many people say he's off his rocker it's
[1:01:56] totally out there how could it possibly
[1:01:58] be it possibly could be there's a
[1:02:01] scripture that says there's coming a
[1:02:03] time right where John is supposed to eat
[1:02:06] the book take that book and eat it up
[1:02:10] it's his flesh it's his blood unless we
[1:02:12] are willing to take his flesh and drink
[1:02:14] his blood then we will have no life in
[1:02:17] us that's what he says
[1:02:20] here he says in this quote that's
[1:02:22] cannibal to drink human blood vampire
[1:02:25] it's a vampire in other words he wants
[1:02:26] us to be cannibals and vampires the the
[1:02:28] carnal mind let's just put it together
[1:02:30] on our own understanding and that's what
[1:02:32] we'll come up with same thing with
[1:02:34] talking about the seal same thing with
[1:02:35] talking about deep things same thing
[1:02:37] with chasing mysteries in the message
[1:02:39] same thing with chasing Mighty signs and
[1:02:42] wonders we we try and deal with it
[1:02:43] carnally in the message it's designed to
[1:02:47] cause confusion brothers and sisters
[1:02:49] it's designed that way the only way
[1:02:52] we're going to get the truth of the
[1:02:54] message of the hour is is by the
[1:02:56] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[1:02:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives
[1:03:01] any other way is going to be carnal
[1:03:03] understanding we're going to surmise the
[1:03:06] the outcome and we're going to say oh
[1:03:08] yeah he wants us to be cannibals and
[1:03:09] vampires he wants us to be Holiness he
[1:03:11] wants us to wear our hair a certain way
[1:03:13] he wants us to never wear pants all
[1:03:15] these different things no no the Bible
[1:03:18] becomes a new book at that point and we
[1:03:20] say whatever he wants is what I want
[1:03:22] I've never wanted anything more in my
[1:03:24] life than what he wants
[1:03:26] right but until we get to that place
[1:03:28] we're just like these guys it's just
[1:03:31] cannibals and vampires it's just carnal
[1:03:33] understanding and the whole audience
[1:03:36] walked away from him he
[1:03:37] says and there was a Ministerial
[1:03:40] Association with him of
[1:03:43] 70 that had been chosen chosen
[1:03:47] ones and he turned to them and he said
[1:03:50] what will you think when you see the son
[1:03:53] of man ascending up from where he came
[1:03:55] from
[1:03:57] now he didn't explain that and he never
[1:03:59] explained how but Paul did later on
[1:04:02] isn't that beautiful the first church
[1:04:04] age messenger yeah the one to start the
[1:04:06] church ages to set the pattern in motion
[1:04:09] and here we are living under the
[1:04:10] ministry of the last Church age
[1:04:12] messenger the one to tie up all of the
[1:04:15] Loose Ends and
[1:04:19] confusion he just said it
[1:04:21] see and then he said what will you say
[1:04:26] to these ministers when you see the son
[1:04:28] of man ascending up from where he come
[1:04:30] from no doubt them men
[1:04:33] said now just a moment oh we eat with
[1:04:36] him we fish with him we sleep with him
[1:04:41] we know where he was
[1:04:43] born we seen the cradle that he was
[1:04:46] rocked
[1:04:47] in and how does this man this is a hard
[1:04:52] saying carnally looking at it through
[1:04:55] the carnal mind
[1:04:56] mind I know you and you know me we know
[1:05:00] where we come from we know our little
[1:05:02] quirks and our little quacks we know all
[1:05:05] the different things the nuances in our
[1:05:08] lives how could we have Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] inside of us I don't know his word says
[1:05:14] it that's the only thing I
[1:05:16] know we see our lives lining up with the
[1:05:19] word that's a wonderful thing but you
[1:05:21] know many times brothers and sisters as
[1:05:24] we walk this road
[1:05:26] that's seldom traveled in this
[1:05:29] world God won't clown for nobody but I
[1:05:32] will say this find yourself in an hour
[1:05:36] of desperation and need call upon the
[1:05:39] name of the Lord and see if he won't
[1:05:41] come on the
[1:05:42] scene he always comes where he's invited
[1:05:47] he always
[1:05:49] does and the Bible said they didn't walk
[1:05:52] with him anymore they left him they just
[1:05:55] left them they couldn't stand it it was
[1:05:57] a carnal
[1:05:59] understanding all they did was get fed
[1:06:02] up and say this man's crazy all he wants
[1:06:06] to do is cause us to be
[1:06:10] cannibals tonight I just want to
[1:06:12] encourage us brothers and sisters if we
[1:06:14] ever get discouraged don't worry he does
[1:06:18] things in the church without explaining
[1:06:20] it even though he has given us the
[1:06:23] entirety of the word we're going to
[1:06:25] spend an eternity living with him having
[1:06:28] him unveil himself to us reveal himself
[1:06:31] to us and even through us so when we
[1:06:34] have things that are confusing here
[1:06:36] things that maybe we just don't even
[1:06:38] understand you know what by and by we
[1:06:40] will in time brother brandham says it in
[1:06:43] the church age book there will come a
[1:06:44] time where every single mystery every
[1:06:47] hidden thing will be shouted from the
[1:06:49] housetops there will be no Mysteries at
[1:06:52] that point in terms of human history but
[1:06:55] when we're living here in this world if
[1:06:57] we could explain it all we would have no
[1:06:59] room for Faith there'd be no need for
[1:07:01] Faith but our walk our Christian walk is
[1:07:04] all about faith we have got to have
[1:07:06] faith in him faith of Jesus Christ
[1:07:10] Living out through US amen and you know
[1:07:13] where we're going to go tonight is into
[1:07:16] Corinthians I'm not going to read it yet
[1:07:18] because we'll uh stand for the reading
[1:07:21] but you know this is the story of the of
[1:07:24] the of the communion
[1:07:26] the Last Supper out of 1 Corinthians
[1:07:28] chap 11 and uh I I just think it's
[1:07:32] wonderful because this is the story that
[1:07:34] we were talking about maybe we could
[1:07:36] just go right into that now we'll just
[1:07:39] take the next step if you want to stand
[1:07:40] with me we'll read this scripture and
[1:07:42] we'll just get right into the communion
[1:07:44] service then we'll go into the foot
[1:07:47] washing and we'll get into the
[1:07:48] testimonies later if anybody has to go
[1:07:51] we certainly don't want you to feel
[1:07:53] trapped we want to make sure that
[1:07:54] everyone is
[1:07:57] comfortable but I think it's just a
[1:07:59] wonderful opportunity to just give the
[1:08:00] Lord the praise for what he's done I
[1:08:02] certainly hope he's done something for
[1:08:04] every single one of
[1:08:08] us in 1 Corinthians chap
[1:08:17] 11 we know this is Paul writing to the
[1:08:19] Corinthians for I have received of the
[1:08:22] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:08:24] you that the Lord
[1:08:26] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:08:29] betrayed took bread and we know this is
[1:08:32] the story out of Luke
[1:08:34] 22 and when he had given thanks he break
[1:08:36] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:08:40] which is broken for you this do in
[1:08:43] remembrance of
[1:08:45] me after the same manner also he took
[1:08:49] the
[1:08:50] cup and when he SED saying this cup is
[1:08:55] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:09:00] as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of
[1:09:04] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:09:08] and drink this cup ye do she the Lord's
[1:09:13] death till he
[1:09:14] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:09:17] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:09:23] unworthily my Bible says in unworthy
[1:09:26] Manner and I would say it this way
[1:09:28] without really understanding what's
[1:09:30] happening without really understanding
[1:09:32] what we're doing if we're just doing it
[1:09:34] just because it's a tradition I highly
[1:09:37] recommend maybe we don't do it just just
[1:09:40] pass by the communion table but if we're
[1:09:42] doing it worthily where we understand
[1:09:45] the gravity of this
[1:09:46] situation then I think it's wonderful
[1:09:49] for us he says where verse 27 wherefore
[1:09:51] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:09:53] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:09:56] guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:10:00] Lord but let a man I would say this let
[1:10:03] a woman let a human a child let us
[1:10:07] examine
[1:10:08] ourselves and so let him eat of that
[1:10:11] bread and drink of that cup yes for he
[1:10:15] that eateth and drinketh
[1:10:17] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:10:20] to himself right not Discerning the
[1:10:24] Lord's body
[1:10:27] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:10:31] among you and many
[1:10:35] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:10:37] should not be judged but when we are
[1:10:41] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:10:45] we should not be condemned with the
[1:10:47] world wherefore my brethren when ye come
[1:10:50] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:10:53] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:10:55] home that you come not together unto
[1:10:58] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:11:01] order when I
[1:11:03] come let's just take a moment or two and
[1:11:07] just consider our hearts consider where
[1:11:10] we're at is there anything that we have
[1:11:16] anything we don't need to have anything
[1:11:18] to hinder us from this

[1:12:24] would bring damnation to us father let
[1:12:27] us not eat or drink damnation to
[1:12:30] ourselves but help us understand father
