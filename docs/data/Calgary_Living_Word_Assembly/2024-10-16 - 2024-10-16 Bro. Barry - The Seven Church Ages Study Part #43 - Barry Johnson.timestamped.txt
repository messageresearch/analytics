[53:53] age and maybe even finish it but we'll
[53:58] see of Revelations chap 2:
[54:02] 18 and unto the angel of the church in
[54:05] thota write these things saith the Son
[54:08] of God who hath his eyes like unto a
[54:12] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[54:16] brass I Know Thy works and charity and
[54:19] service and faith and thy patience and
[54:22] thy works and the last to be more than
[54:25] the first
[54:27] notwithstanding I have a few things
[54:28] against thee because thou sufferest that
[54:31] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[54:35] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[54:38] servants to commit fornication and to
[54:41] eat things sacrificed unto idols and I
[54:45] gave her space to repent of her
[54:47] fornication and she repented
[54:50] not behold I will cast her into a bed
[54:53] and them that commit adultery with her
[54:56] in to Great
[54:57] Tribulation except they repent of their
[55:00] deeds and I will kill her children with
[55:03] death and all the churches shall know
[55:06] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[55:10] and hearts and I will give unto every
[55:14] one of you according to your works but
[55:17] unto you I say and unto the rest in
[55:20] thota as many as have not this Doctrine
[55:24] and which have not known the depths of
[55:26] Satan as they
[55:28] speak I will put upon you none other
[55:32] burden but that which ye have already
[55:35] hold fast till I come and he that
[55:38] overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the
[55:40] end to him will I give power over the
[55:43] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[55:46] rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter
[55:49] shall they be broken to Shivers even as
[55:52] I received of my father and I will give
[55:55] him the morning
[55:56] star he that hath an ear let him hear
[56:00] what the spirit saith unto the
[56:03] churches let's just pray one more
[56:06] time Heavenly Father Lord tonight I pray
[56:09] that we could just hold fast to that
[56:11] word that you have given to us in this
[56:13] age Lord we know that we're not running
[56:16] a Sprint father it's a marathon and the
[56:20] prize goes to those who finish and Lord
[56:23] Jesus I pray that every one of us Lord
[56:25] would just be able to to leave this
[56:27] building encouraged tonight father that
[56:29] we would sense you father in person
[56:32] tonight Lord that it wouldn't just be an
[56:34] ordinary service we just want to commit
[56:37] each life and each family into your
[56:40] hands For Your Glory now in Jesus
[56:42] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[56:45] tonight you may be
[56:50] seated just a couple of announcements
[56:53] before we go too far we have the Youth
[56:55] Event coming up on the 20th it's hard to
[56:58] believe that we're actually just over
[57:01] the halfway mark in
[57:04] October pretty soon we'll be seeing snow
[57:07] and uh winter time in
[57:09] November but hopefully not until then we
[57:12] have the Youth Event the 20th of October
[57:14] it's going to be at uh brother Joel and
[57:16] sister Crystal's house with brother
[57:17] Jerry Fox from end time message
[57:20] Tabernacle he is not a minister but he
[57:23] is definitely a brother who knows a
[57:26] thing or two about life through his
[57:28] experiences and he just loves the Lord
[57:30] more than anything and he's going to
[57:32] bring of his wisdom and try and impart
[57:35] some of it to those who come and I'm
[57:38] certainly thankful that brother Joel and
[57:40] Sister Crystal have opened it up to
[57:41] whoever is interested to come because
[57:43] there will definitely be nuggets of
[57:45] information uh that our brother will be
[57:47] able to share with us um on the 27th of
[57:51] October we're going to have brother ciz
[57:53] atuan take a service here before he
[57:56] departs to
[57:58] Toronto so uh are you happy
[58:02] tonight it's a wonderful time of year
[58:05] I'm just uh relishing in the change of
[58:08] the leaves it's such a beautiful time um
[58:12] it can be a little bit of a difficult
[58:13] time for some changing of of times and
[58:17] uh we know the time change kicks in soon
[58:21] um but it just is what it is it's where
[58:24] we live t tonight we're going to pick up
[58:26] from where we left off last time in the
[58:30] thoan church age in the uh subheading of
[58:33] space to repent and it's out of
[58:36] Revelations uh chapter 2: 21 and it says
[58:40] I gave her space to repent of her
[58:43] fornication and she repented
[58:46] not brother Bram he says here do you
[58:48] know that this church was actually more
[58:51] wicked than Ahab that's pretty wicked
[58:54] isn't it Ahab was was a pretty wicked
[58:57] fell he uh he did some things that
[59:00] really upset the
[59:03] Lord do you know that he repented for a
[59:06] while and walked softly before
[59:09] God you can't say that of the Roman
[59:11] Catholic Church no sir she has never
[59:14] repented but has stubbornly destroyed
[59:18] any and all who tried to help her
[59:22] repent that is history now God kept
[59:25] Rising up not only the messengers to
[59:28] each
[59:29] age but he raised up some wonderful
[59:32] helpers for those Messengers and gave
[59:35] every age some wonderful men of God and
[59:39] they did everything they could to bring
[59:41] the church back to God God certainly
[59:44] gave her an opportunity to
[59:46] repent did she ever repent and show that
[59:50] she did buy her
[59:52] fruits and see this is such a a
[59:54] beautiful thing because we can can say
[59:56] that we repent all we want we can talk
[59:59] and talk and talk but what are the
[1:00:02] fruits of our life did she did she ever
[1:00:07] repent and show that she did by her
[1:00:09] fruits no sir she never has and she
[1:00:12] never will she's drunk she has lost her
[1:00:15] senses in spiritual
[1:00:18] things I think it's just uh a pretty
[1:00:21] neat study if you look at First Kings
[1:00:23] chapter 21 I'm not going to turn there
[1:00:25] tonight but but the story of Ahab and
[1:00:28] how he wanted to get this uh Vineyard
[1:00:32] that naboth owned and it was his
[1:00:35] Birthright to have that Vineyard so he's
[1:00:37] actually trying to steal someone's
[1:00:39] Birthright which is spiritually Wicked
[1:00:43] but he told the story to his wife and
[1:00:45] his wife just said why don't you just do
[1:00:47] away with him what's wrong with you
[1:00:48] you're the king you can just do what you
[1:00:50] want to do so she went and she had him
[1:00:53] actually murdered and then gave the land
[1:00:55] of Vineyard to her
[1:00:58] husband the woman who's in control
[1:01:01] hey and we know brother bam talks about
[1:01:03] it how Ahab was the head but she was the
[1:01:05] neck that turned the head she was the
[1:01:08] one in
[1:01:09] control but the point I want to get to
[1:01:11] is Ahab who was so wicked got got got
[1:01:15] the Lord God Almighty so upset that he
[1:01:19] said you know what I'm going to wipe him
[1:01:20] off the face of the Earth the dogs are
[1:01:23] going to lick the blood of Ahab and his
[1:01:25] wife wife and his wife is going to be
[1:01:27] eaten by the dogs just a terrible
[1:01:29] terrible story when when he was boastful
[1:01:32] when the prophet came to him with the
[1:01:34] word of God and and he said oh do I see
[1:01:36] my my enemy do I see my enemy here and
[1:01:39] he said you know you see the word of the
[1:01:40] Lord that's what's coming to you buddy
[1:01:42] and uh the prophet told him this is what
[1:01:44] God he's done with you he's finished
[1:01:46] with you you are a menace and now you're
[1:01:49] going to get it and uh he departed and
[1:01:52] what happened was Ahab actually walked
[1:01:54] Softly As what the word says He put on
[1:01:57] sackcloth and Ash he knew there was a
[1:01:59] God in Israel and he knew that he was in
[1:02:02] the transgression and God even said to
[1:02:05] the prophet you know what I won't bring
[1:02:07] judgment on the house of ahab's family
[1:02:10] until he passes away I'll give him that
[1:02:13] space But once he's gone then my wrath
[1:02:16] will be Unleashed on the children of
[1:02:17] Israel because of his sin a space to
[1:02:21] repent isn't it a wonderful God that we
[1:02:23] serve isn't he so wonderful we've got so
[1:02:26] many things to be thankful for but I
[1:02:28] think that's one thing that's just
[1:02:30] amazing we could thank him forever that
[1:02:32] he gives us a space to repent
[1:02:37] my unfortunately the Believers they
[1:02:40] don't desire to do wicked not like Ahab
[1:02:42] I'm not trying to draw a parallel with
[1:02:44] the believer with Ahab I'm just saying
[1:02:46] that the the the contrast here is that
[1:02:49] Ahab was a bad bad guy and the Church of
[1:02:53] Rome is worse that's amazing to think
[1:02:57] about now God kept raising up not only
[1:03:00] the messengers to each age but he raised
[1:03:01] up some wonderful helpers for those
[1:03:03] Messengers he gave every age some
[1:03:05] wonderful men of God and they did
[1:03:07] everything they could to bring the
[1:03:08] church back to God God certainly gave
[1:03:11] her opportunity to help and help to
[1:03:14] repent did she ever repent and show that
[1:03:16] she did by her fruits no sir she never
[1:03:19] has and she never will she's drunk she
[1:03:22] has lost her senses in spiritual things
[1:03:27] now don't be confused and start thinking
[1:03:28] that the Church of Rome has repented of
[1:03:31] her Slaughter of the Saints because she
[1:03:34] is attempting to unite with the
[1:03:36] Protestants by making her Creeds to line
[1:03:39] up with the Protestant Creeds not once
[1:03:42] has she ever apologized and said she was
[1:03:44] wrong for her mass murders and she won't
[1:03:47] either and no matter how mellow and
[1:03:51] sweet she appears at this particular
[1:03:53] time did you ever see how the pope looks
[1:03:55] these days he looks pretty mellow and
[1:03:58] really sweet doesn't he if you haven't
[1:04:01] seen him take a look at the way he
[1:04:03] speaks in his demeanor he fits this to a
[1:04:06] te mellow and sweet she appears at this
[1:04:09] particular time she will rise up yet to
[1:04:11] kill for murder lies in her evil and
[1:04:16] unrepentant heart now just for the
[1:04:19] record I'm not throwing off on the pope
[1:04:21] I'm saying it is the anointing behind
[1:04:24] the pope it's the spirit that dwells in
[1:04:26] that Pope and he doesn't even know
[1:04:31] it the sentence against the harlet past
[1:04:35] it's out of Revelations 2:22 to 23
[1:04:38] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[1:04:40] them that commit adultery with her into
[1:04:43] Great Tribulation except they repent of
[1:04:45] their deeds and I will kill her children
[1:04:47] with death and all the churches shall
[1:04:51] know that I am he which searcheth the
[1:04:54] Reigns and hearts and I will give unto
[1:04:57] every one of you according to your
[1:05:00] Works what this woman has
[1:05:04] children and she a
[1:05:07] if that is the case that she had
[1:05:10] children by whoredoms then she must be
[1:05:12] burnt with fire as the word has said and
[1:05:14] we know that's Old Testament law right
[1:05:18] that's what he's saying there Old
[1:05:20] Testament law said that she should be
[1:05:23] burnt with fire her end is the Lake of
[1:05:26] Fire but stop and think about these
[1:05:28] children for a moment a woman is the one
[1:05:33] out of whom the children come it is
[1:05:37] evident that this woman had children
[1:05:39] that came out of her but they did the
[1:05:41] same thing she did show me one church
[1:05:44] that ever came out of organization that
[1:05:46] didn't go right back into it there isn't
[1:05:51] one not one the lutherans came out and
[1:05:54] then organized right back and today they
[1:05:57] are a hand and a glove with this
[1:05:59] ecumenical move the methodists came out
[1:06:01] and they organized right back the
[1:06:03] Pentecostals came out and they organized
[1:06:06] right back there is going to be another
[1:06:09] coming out and praise God they won't
[1:06:11] organize back because they know the
[1:06:14] truth that group will be the Bride of
[1:06:17] the last day that's why I think it's so
[1:06:20] beautiful the Bride of the last day
[1:06:22] won't organize won't try and usurp the
[1:06:25] author uity of man into the church won't
[1:06:28] want to play politics and medal in the
[1:06:31] word they will just keep God
[1:06:34] first now it's said here that this
[1:06:38] had children now what were they they
[1:06:41] were daughters for they were churches
[1:06:44] just like her now here is a very
[1:06:46] interesting point Jezreel and Ahab had a
[1:06:50] daughter that daughter married jehoram
[1:06:54] the son of josephat
[1:06:56] and in 2 Kings 8:18 it says that jehoram
[1:07:00] walked in the ways of his father-in-law
[1:07:03] my he went right into idolatry by this
[1:07:06] marriage he brought God-fearing and God
[1:07:09] worshipping Judah into
[1:07:12] idolatry that's exactly what these
[1:07:14] daughter churches have done even as I
[1:07:17] have pointed out to you they start in
[1:07:19] the truth and marry into organization
[1:07:22] and leave the word for tradition Creeds
[1:07:24] Etc now let me get this across in
[1:07:27] Hebrews it says obey them which have
[1:07:30] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[1:07:34] the word of
[1:07:36] God Hebrews
[1:07:38] 13:7 it is the word that rules us not
[1:07:42] men it is the word that rules us not men
[1:07:48] now a man has as a husband is the head
[1:07:51] of the woman he rules her but the church
[1:07:55] is a woman too and her ruler is the word
[1:08:01] Jesus is the word if she rejects the
[1:08:04] word and takes any other
[1:08:08] headship she is an
[1:08:10] adulteress I say Lord help us help us to
[1:08:14] get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives help us
[1:08:17] to get the token in our lives because
[1:08:19] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:08:20] prevent us from taking another headship
[1:08:23] and I want to just be super clear about
[1:08:24] it if we refuse to go all the way to the
[1:08:28] true baptism of the Holy Ghost then we
[1:08:30] accept another headship that's the way
[1:08:32] it works there's no middle ground
[1:08:34] there's no saying well I'm just not
[1:08:36] ready yet brother Barry you know there
[1:08:37] comes a point in time of accountability
[1:08:39] where we have got to make that stand in
[1:08:42] our lives any other headship you become
[1:08:46] an adulteress brother bam talks about
[1:08:48] that in the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:08:50] of Jesus Christ he simply says you've
[1:08:51] got to die out to yourself every single
[1:08:53] Speck of the old man's got to go and so
[1:08:57] long as that happens you can go on to
[1:09:01] Christ now you name me one church that
[1:09:04] hasn't given up the word for traditions
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:09] Creeds this is tough isn't it they are
[1:09:14] all
[1:09:15] adulteresses like mother like
[1:09:18] daughter what will be the punishment of
[1:09:21] the Harlot and her children well it's
[1:09:23] going to be twofold first he said I will
[1:09:26] cast her into a bed according to the
[1:09:28] last part of verse 22 it will be a bed
[1:09:30] of tribulation or the Great Tribulation
[1:09:33] that is exactly what Jesus said in
[1:09:35] Matthew 25 1-13 there were 10 virgins
[1:09:39] five were wise five were foolish all
[1:09:43] virgins though the five wise had oil the
[1:09:46] Holy Spirit but the other five did not
[1:09:51] and when the cry went up behold the
[1:09:52] bridegroom cometh the five f foolish had
[1:09:56] to run seeking oil while the five wise
[1:09:59] virgins went into the
[1:10:01] marriage the five that remained outside
[1:10:04] were left to the Great
[1:10:06] Tribulation that is what will happen to
[1:10:09] all who do not go up in the Rapture that
[1:10:11] is what will come upon the Harlot and
[1:10:14] her
[1:10:17] daughters but I think we can just rest
[1:10:19] assured because if we do get the Holy
[1:10:21] Ghost In Our Lives there's no
[1:10:23] tribulation tribulation that we endure
[1:10:25] here is worthy of that Resurrection
[1:10:29] morning the the little things that we
[1:10:31] have to go through here are nothing to
[1:10:33] be compared to what we will see when
[1:10:36] that date
[1:10:38] changes secondly it says that he will
[1:10:40] kill them with death or as a literal
[1:10:44] translation says let them be put to
[1:10:47] death with death this is a strange
[1:10:50] saying we might say let a man be put to
[1:10:53] death by hanging or by electrocution
[1:10:55] or some other way but this says let them
[1:10:58] be put to death by death death
[1:11:01] itself is the cause of their
[1:11:05] death and we know that brother Bram is
[1:11:07] talking about eternal separation in this
[1:11:09] flesh we die and then go into the grave
[1:11:12] not accepting the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:11:14] we come to judgment stand before the
[1:11:17] white throne and if you're not found
[1:11:19] written in that book then you're cast
[1:11:21] alive into the Lake of Fire that place
[1:11:23] that was created for the devil and his
[1:11:25] Angels not for human beings hell was not
[1:11:27] created for human beings the Lake of
[1:11:29] Fire wasn't created for human
[1:11:32] beings but that's Eternal
[1:11:34] separation now I want you to see this
[1:11:37] clearly so I will take out our
[1:11:40] illustration again of the daughter of
[1:11:41] Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah
[1:11:44] and thereby bringing it right into
[1:11:46] idolatry and causing God to deliver
[1:11:48] Judah to death this is what balum did
[1:11:51] too so here was Jezebel with her Peg
[1:11:55] pism over there is Judah properly
[1:11:58] worshiping God and living under the word
[1:12:02] so Jezebel marries her daughter to
[1:12:06] jehoram the minute that
[1:12:08] happens jehoram causes the people to
[1:12:11] become
[1:12:12] idolators and you know brothers and
[1:12:14] sisters it's the same thing today don't
[1:12:15] think for a second not one second that
[1:12:18] we can actually marry someone who
[1:12:20] doesn't have the Holy Ghost and think
[1:12:22] that it's actually going to work out cuz
[1:12:24] it ain't going to work out
[1:12:26] outside of a extraordinary miracle from
[1:12:30] God it ain't going to work out what will
[1:12:32] happen is we will become idolators
[1:12:35] ourself brother bradam calls it hell on
[1:12:38] Earth the minute that marriage took
[1:12:41] place Judah was
[1:12:45] dead spiritual death came
[1:12:48] in the minute the First Church of Rome
[1:12:50] organized it
[1:12:52] died the minute that the Lutheran
[1:12:54] organized death came in and they
[1:12:57] died the Pentecostals came Al along last
[1:13:02] and they organized the spirit left
[1:13:04] though they don't believe it but he did
[1:13:07] that marriage brought death then the
[1:13:10] light of Oneness of the godhead came
[1:13:13] they organized and they died
[1:13:15] too then after the fire of God fell on
[1:13:18] the Ohio River in
[1:13:21] 1933 a healing Revival swept the world
[1:13:24] but but it never came through any
[1:13:27] organization God went outside the
[1:13:29] Pentecostal groups outside of
[1:13:33] organization and what he is going to do
[1:13:35] in the future is going to be outside of
[1:13:38] organization too why it's just amazing
[1:13:42] to look at it because the common ground
[1:13:44] for those people that are on the outside
[1:13:46] is that someone is trying to do
[1:13:48] something different right if you were a
[1:13:51] Pentecostal or if you were a Baptist or
[1:13:52] a presbyterian everyone could say well
[1:13:54] you're a any costal a Baptist or a
[1:13:56] presbyterian and you know they're normal
[1:13:58] we you know we we know how to deal with
[1:14:00] those people we know what they believe
[1:14:01] but when you come along with a word from
[1:14:03] God a thus sayith the Lord you're
[1:14:05] outside of all of them the one thing
[1:14:08] they can do is band together and say
[1:14:09] that they're just trying to start
[1:14:11] something new but when you can identify
[1:14:13] it in the word it's
[1:14:16] unmistakable God can't work through the
[1:14:18] dead he says he can only work through
[1:14:20] the living members those living members
[1:14:23] are outside of
[1:14:25] Babylon no
[1:14:27] Organization no
[1:14:29] affiliation every single church is
[1:14:33] Sovereign under the headship of the Holy
[1:14:37] Ghost so you see death or organization
[1:14:40] came and the church died or to make it
[1:14:43] plainer death became a resident wherein
[1:14:46] shortly before only life
[1:14:48] reigned as in the original Eve brought
[1:14:52] death to mankind so now organization has
[1:14:55] brought death for organization is the
[1:14:58] product of the double corruptors Oh my
[1:15:01] he goes back to this I've got this
[1:15:03] highlighted here and I'm going to talk
[1:15:04] about it for just a minute here the
[1:15:06] double corruptors do we remember what
[1:15:07] they are you're probably reading it
[1:15:09] already nianis and
[1:15:12] bism the leadership of man over man
[1:15:16] Conquering the Ley niik is to conquer
[1:15:20] and
[1:15:20] Ley is the leoty the church the
[1:15:25] leadership trying to conquer the men and
[1:15:27] bmismart
[1:15:55] intervened taking her quickly to himself
[1:15:58] so that she was saved but when this
[1:16:01] satanic religion has gone full course of
[1:16:04] the ages you can just hear him preaching
[1:16:07] the trail of the serpent here can't you
[1:16:10] this satanic religion from the Garden of
[1:16:13] Eden all the way through has gone the
[1:16:15] full course of the ages there will be no
[1:16:18] one to intervene and she will be burned
[1:16:21] with her Seducer for the and her
[1:16:24] children and and the Antichrist and
[1:16:26] Satan will all find their places in the
[1:16:30] Lake of
[1:16:31] Fire right here I will be getting ahead
[1:16:34] of myself and maybe I ought to reserve
[1:16:36] this for the message on the last age but
[1:16:38] it seems just right to put it in now
[1:16:41] because it deals so clearly and so
[1:16:44] clearly with organization and what's
[1:16:45] going to happen through it and I want to
[1:16:48] warn you and I just love that we're
[1:16:51] getting a
[1:16:51] warning this is the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:16:54] through him
[1:16:56] and now
[1:16:58] he he says Revelations 13 1-18 and I
[1:17:02] stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a
[1:17:04] beast rise up out of the sea having
[1:17:06] seven heads and 10 horns and upon his
[1:17:09] horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the
[1:17:12] name of blasphemy and the Beast which I
[1:17:16] saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
[1:17:19] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[1:17:24] as the mouth of of a lion and the dragon
[1:17:27] gave him his power and his seat and
[1:17:31] great Authority now just a side note
[1:17:34] here I'm just going to make for those
[1:17:37] people who don't know if you type in
[1:17:41] United Nations lion or United Nations
[1:17:45] statue you could type that in and you'll
[1:17:47] see it it's in New York right now an
[1:17:49] exact replica of what is actually
[1:17:51] described here in the scripture right
[1:17:54] outside of the the United Nations in New
[1:17:57] York and I saw one of his heads as it
[1:17:59] were wounded to death and his deadly
[1:18:01] wound was healed and all the world
[1:18:04] wondered after the Beast and they
[1:18:07] worshiped the dragon which gave power
[1:18:10] unto the Beast and they worshiped the
[1:18:12] Beast saying who is like unto the Beast
[1:18:14] who is able to make war with him and
[1:18:16] there was given unto him a mouth
[1:18:19] speaking great things and
[1:18:21] blasphemies and power was given unto him
[1:18:24] to continue 40 and2 months and we know
[1:18:27] that's three and a half years and he
[1:18:29] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[1:18:31] God to blaspheme his name and his
[1:18:33] Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[1:18:37] you know in the in the morning devotions
[1:18:40] the brother that does this reading he he
[1:18:42] always says can you imagine that
[1:18:43] blaspheming the people in heaven and all
[1:18:45] the saints can you imagine doing that
[1:18:48] doesn't even make
[1:18:50] sense and it was given unto him to make
[1:18:52] war with the Saints and to overcome them
[1:18:54] and power was given him over all
[1:18:57] kindreds and tongues and Nations and all
[1:19:00] that dwelleth upon the Earth shall
[1:19:01] worship Him whose names are not written
[1:19:04] in the book of the lamb slain before the
[1:19:07] foundation of the world if any man have
[1:19:09] an ear let him hear he that leadth into
[1:19:12] captivity shall go into captivity he
[1:19:15] that kth with the sword must be killed
[1:19:18] with the sword here is the patience and
[1:19:21] the faith of the
[1:19:23] Saints and I beheld another Beast coming
[1:19:26] up out of the earth and he had two horns
[1:19:28] like a lamb and spake as a dragon and he
[1:19:32] exerciseth all the power of the first
[1:19:34] Beast before him and causeth the Earth
[1:19:38] and them which dwell therein to worship
[1:19:40] the first Beast whose deadly wound was
[1:19:45] healed and he doeth great wonders so
[1:19:47] that he maketh Fire come down from
[1:19:49] heaven on the earth in the sight of men
[1:19:52] just have to throw a pause there and
[1:19:53] just say you know what that scripture
[1:19:55] there is not something out in the future
[1:19:57] that that's history already the prophet
[1:19:59] already declared the United States of
[1:20:01] America Revelations chapter 13 has
[1:20:04] already called fire down from out of the
[1:20:06] sky the prophet has declared that this
[1:20:08] this mystery is history and he doeth
[1:20:11] great wonders so that he maketh Fire
[1:20:13] come down from heaven on the earth in
[1:20:15] the sight of men and just to I guess get
[1:20:19] specific about it if you take a look at
[1:20:20] how those bombs were actually detonated
[1:20:22] they didn't hit the ground and then go
[1:20:24] off they actually burst in the air they
[1:20:27] came down from heaven we know that and
[1:20:30] he deceived them that dwell on the Earth
[1:20:32] by the means of those Miracles which he
[1:20:34] had power to do in the sight of the
[1:20:37] Beast saying to them that dwell on the
[1:20:39] earth that they should make an image to
[1:20:42] the Beast which had a wound by a sword
[1:20:46] and did live and he had power to give
[1:20:49] life unto the image of the Beast and the
[1:20:53] image of the Beast should both speak and
[1:20:56] cause as many as would not worship the
[1:20:58] image of the Beast should be killed and
[1:21:01] he causeth all both great and small and
[1:21:05] great rich and poor free and bond to
[1:21:07] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[1:21:10] their foreheads and that no man might
[1:21:13] buy or sell save he that have the Mark
[1:21:16] or the name of the Beast or the number
[1:21:19] of his name here is the wisdom let him
[1:21:22] that hath understanding count the number
[1:21:24] of the Beast for it is the number of a
[1:21:27] man and its number is 63 score and6 we
[1:21:32] know that
[1:21:33] 666 this chapter here speaking
[1:21:35] specifically about the United States of
[1:21:38] America and uh we can get into that in a
[1:21:40] later study but it's amazing to see how
[1:21:44] the the prophet actually uses this
[1:21:46] scripture Revelations 131 to18 to
[1:21:49] actually bring out what he's going to
[1:21:50] talk about
[1:21:51] next he says this chapter shows the
[1:21:54] power of the Roman Catholic church and
[1:21:57] what she will do through
[1:22:00] organization remember this is the false
[1:22:03] Vine let it name the name of the Lord it
[1:22:07] does so only in a lie its headship is
[1:22:11] not of the Lord but of Satan it finally
[1:22:14] ends up completely identified with the
[1:22:16] Beast the riding on the Scarlet
[1:22:20] Beast distinctly shows her power is the
[1:22:23] god of force course Satan and not our
[1:22:27] God the Lord Jesus Christ in verse 17 it
[1:22:31] emphatically shows that she will gain
[1:22:34] absolute control of the Commerce of the
[1:22:36] Earth for no man can buy or sell apart
[1:22:39] from her now just to be clear for those
[1:22:42] who are listening and and reading along
[1:22:44] this is after the bride has already gone
[1:22:48] we're not going to be showing a mark on
[1:22:50] our hand or on our forehead we talked a
[1:22:52] little bit about this I think on Sunday
[1:22:53] we're not going to have the mark of the
[1:22:54] Beast and and enduring the people who
[1:22:57] were maybe the five unwise virgins are
[1:23:00] probably going to have to go through
[1:23:01] something similar there's going to be a
[1:23:03] time where the entire Commerce of the
[1:23:05] earth will be controlled for sure right
[1:23:08] now we're talking about the spiritual
[1:23:10] mark of the beast which is already in
[1:23:13] every single human being whether they
[1:23:15] know it or not whether they understand
[1:23:17] it or not it's just like gravity we
[1:23:19] might not be able to even explain it but
[1:23:20] it's there it's the DNA that we have
[1:23:23] these bodies these Hybrid Bodies that we
[1:23:25] live in and uh outside of receiving the
[1:23:28] Holy Ghost we already have the mark of
[1:23:30] the beast but don't look for this day
[1:23:32] this day is a long ways away from us
[1:23:36] fortunately it's it's going to be a
[1:23:37] terrible
[1:23:40] time in Revelations 13:14 we learn that
[1:23:44] the Beast spreads his influence through
[1:23:46] the image which is built which was built
[1:23:49] for him the image that was made is a
[1:23:52] worldwide ecumenical
[1:23:55] Council wherein all the organized
[1:23:58] churches will get together with the
[1:24:01] Roman
[1:24:02] Catholics they are doing it even
[1:24:05] now it's quite possible this Union will
[1:24:08] come in order to stop the power of
[1:24:11] Communism isn't that an interesting
[1:24:15] statement it's possible it is quite
[1:24:18] possible this Union will come in order
[1:24:21] to stop the power of communism
[1:24:25] we can see the world stage right now
[1:24:28] there's a couple of communist countries
[1:24:29] that are flexing their muscles right can
[1:24:34] see the Beast coming in and and stepping
[1:24:37] up and pushing this back he goes on to
[1:24:39] say but since communism like
[1:24:41] Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to
[1:24:43] burn the Flesh of the Harlot Rome will
[1:24:46] be overcome and
[1:24:48] destroyed take note that everywhere the
[1:24:51] romish church went
[1:24:55] communism
[1:24:56] followed that's interesting history it
[1:25:00] has to be that way and let me warn you
[1:25:02] now don't get thinking that communism is
[1:25:05] your only enemy no sir it is the
[1:25:08] Catholic Church also and even more so we
[1:25:11] know brother bam talks about the bamboo
[1:25:13] the iron and the purple curtains and he
[1:25:16] said Don't Fear the other ones but fear
[1:25:19] the purple one now let us read
[1:25:21] Revelations 13 1:4 and compare this with
[1:25:24] re Revelations 12
[1:25:26] 1:5 and I stood upon the sand of the sea
[1:25:29] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[1:25:31] having seven heads and 10 horns and upon
[1:25:34] his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads
[1:25:37] the name of
[1:25:39] blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was
[1:25:42] like unto a leopard and his feet were as
[1:25:44] the feet of a bear and his mouth as the
[1:25:47] mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him
[1:25:49] his power and his seat and great
[1:25:53] Authority
[1:25:55] and I saw one of his heads as it were
[1:25:57] wounded to death and this his deadly
[1:26:00] wound was healed and all the world
[1:26:03] wandered after the Beast and they
[1:26:06] worshiped the dragon which gave power
[1:26:07] unto the Beast and they worshiped the
[1:26:09] Beast saying who is like unto the Beast
[1:26:11] who is able to make war with him
[1:26:14] Revelations 13 1:4 then he says
[1:26:16] Revelations 12 1-5 and there appeared a
[1:26:19] great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed
[1:26:21] in in the Sun and the Moon under her
[1:26:24] feet and upon her head a crown of 12
[1:26:27] stars and she being with child travailed
[1:26:30] in birth and pained to be delivered and
[1:26:34] there appeared another Wonder in heaven
[1:26:36] and behold a great red dragon having
[1:26:39] seven heads and 10 horns and seven
[1:26:41] crowns upon his heads and his tail drew
[1:26:45] the third part of the stars of heaven
[1:26:48] and cast them to the earth and the
[1:26:51] dragon stood before the woman which was
[1:26:54] was ready to be delivered for to devour
[1:26:56] her child as soon as it was born and she
[1:26:59] brought forth a Manchild who was to rule
[1:27:02] all nations with a rod of iron and her
[1:27:05] child was caught up into God unto God
[1:27:09] and to his
[1:27:13] throne Satan and his satanic religion
[1:27:17] are in both of these beasts
[1:27:24] Revelations 13 the Beast that was
[1:27:26] wounded unto death but lived again is
[1:27:30] Imperial Pagan Rome that fell to the
[1:27:33] onslaught of the barbarians and thereby
[1:27:36] lost her temporal power but she regained
[1:27:39] it in paple room he says do you see it
[1:27:43] now this discussion here is brought out
[1:27:46] in the in the study of the seals brother
[1:27:49] Bram talks about it quite extensively if
[1:27:51] you're interested the Pagan Ro and Papal
[1:27:54] room the the deadly wound that was
[1:27:57] healed he says the nation that ruled by
[1:28:00] crushing all and which became the
[1:28:02] strongest empire ever known was finally
[1:28:05] wounded to death her power was gone
[1:28:08] physically as to control by armies Etc
[1:28:12] but under Constantine she came back to
[1:28:15] life for papal Rome has infiltrated the
[1:28:18] whole world and her power is absolute
[1:28:22] she uses Kings and Merchants and in her
[1:28:24] deadly religious and financial strength
[1:28:27] she is governing as the goddess of this
[1:28:30] present age she is also the dragon that
[1:28:33] stood waiting to Devour the
[1:28:35] Manchild Herod tried to kill the Lord
[1:28:38] Jesus and failed later Jesus was
[1:28:41] crucified by Roman soldiers but now is
[1:28:45] caught up to the
[1:28:46] throne exactly according to that
[1:28:49] scripture now along with what I have
[1:28:51] just said recall the vision of Daniel
[1:28:54] the last part of the image the last
[1:28:56] World power was in the feet that was
[1:29:00] iron and Clay see the iron is the Roman
[1:29:03] Empire but now it's no longer solid iron
[1:29:07] Clay is mixed in it yet it is there and
[1:29:12] running world affairs in both the
[1:29:15] democratic nations and the more despotic
[1:29:19] ones the romish church is in every
[1:29:23] nation it is mixed up in all that's
[1:29:27] amazing to think that the romish church
[1:29:29] is in every nation and we know this word
[1:29:32] has gone out to Every
[1:29:35] Nation I think it's interesting brother
[1:29:37] bradam he talks about something that
[1:29:39] happened in New York on October the 12th
[1:29:42] just a couple days ago really in 1960 it
[1:29:46] happened in New York at the United
[1:29:48] Nations let me give you a little
[1:29:49] something on the iron and the clay he
[1:29:52] says Remember When
[1:29:55] kushnev beat his shoe on the desk at the
[1:29:58] UN well there were five eastern Nations
[1:30:01] there and five
[1:30:05] Western kushnev spoke for the East and
[1:30:09] President Eisenhower for the West in
[1:30:12] Russian kushev is clay and Eisenhower
[1:30:17] means iron the two main leaders of the
[1:30:20] world the two big toes of the feet of
[1:30:24] iron and Clay were side by side we are
[1:30:28] in the end of it all it makes me wonder
[1:30:31] just as we're talking about this and you
[1:30:33] know just studying it all H how much
[1:30:37] really is there
[1:30:38] left how late really is
[1:30:42] it
[1:30:44] my in verse four it asks who is able to
[1:30:47] make war with the Beast now there are at
[1:30:50] present some great names in the world
[1:30:53] there are some mighty Nations but right
[1:30:55] now Rome is calling the
[1:30:58] tune the pope is in the driver's seat
[1:31:02] and his power is going to
[1:31:04] increase no one can war against
[1:31:08] him verse six and he opened his mouth in
[1:31:12] blasphemy teaching for Doctrine the
[1:31:14] Commandments of men heady high-m minded
[1:31:16] lovers of pleasure having a form of
[1:31:19] godliness and denying the power thereof
[1:31:23] he Blas blasphemed the name of God
[1:31:26] changing that name to titles and
[1:31:30] refusing to do
[1:31:32] otherwise in verse 7 and it was given
[1:31:35] unto him to make war with the Saints
[1:31:38] persecution death to the True Believer
[1:31:41] and all in the name of the Lord in order
[1:31:45] that the name of God be blasphemed even
[1:31:49] as it is in Russia because of what the
[1:31:52] Catholic religion did there and we know
[1:31:55] brother bam says it very clearly that
[1:31:56] it's going to be Russia that crushes
[1:31:58] Rome that destroys Rome in 1 hour one
[1:32:02] hour that whole city will be gone
[1:32:04] anybody here ever been there you've seen
[1:32:05] that City it's big there's a lot of
[1:32:08] people they call it the Eternal City and
[1:32:11] that in itself is a
[1:32:15] blaspheme verse eight and all that dwell
[1:32:18] upon the Earth all whose names are not
[1:32:20] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:32:22] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:32:24] shall worship him they want to eat there
[1:32:28] isn't going to be any eating there isn't
[1:32:29] going to be any worshiping you're not
[1:32:30] going to be doing anything you won't
[1:32:31] even be going to school unless you can
[1:32:33] produce that number that's in the back
[1:32:35] of your hand or in your forehead right
[1:32:38] now then see this what we have been
[1:32:41] trying to show you the seed of death
[1:32:44] that started in the first age this seed
[1:32:48] of
[1:32:49] organization has finally grown into the
[1:32:52] tree in which every foul bird is
[1:32:55] lodged in spite of her claims that she
[1:32:59] is The Giver of Life she is The Giver of
[1:33:02] death her fruit is death they that
[1:33:05] partake of her are dead this Mighty
[1:33:09] World Church system that fools the world
[1:33:13] that in her is physical and spiritual
[1:33:16] salvation deceives and destroys the
[1:33:20] multitudes but not only is she is but
[1:33:24] not only is she death personified but
[1:33:27] this dead caran creature will be itself
[1:33:31] put to death with death which is the
[1:33:34] Lake of
[1:33:35] Fire oh that men would perceive what
[1:33:38] their end will be by remaining in her
[1:33:41] come out of her for why will ye
[1:33:46] Die
[1:33:47] My a final warning Revelations
[1:33:52] 2:23 and I will kill her children with
[1:33:56] death and all the churches shall know
[1:33:59] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[1:34:03] and hearts and I will give unto every
[1:34:05] one of you according to your
[1:34:08] Works God lookth on the heart that has
[1:34:11] never changed neither will it ever
[1:34:15] change here as though all the ages as
[1:34:19] through all the ages there are two
[1:34:21] groups both proclaiming their Revelation
[1:34:23] from God God and their relationship to
[1:34:26] God 2 Timothy 2:19
[1:34:28] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:34:31] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:34:34] knoweth them that are
[1:34:37] his the Lord searcheth the Reigns the
[1:34:40] word search means to track or follow up
[1:34:44] I love this thought here I've got it
[1:34:46] highlighted God tracks down our thoughts
[1:34:49] he knows what's in our heart he sees our
[1:34:52] works which are a definite
[1:34:55] manifestation of what lies within
[1:34:59] us God tracks down our thoughts Reigns
[1:35:03] he knows what's in our hearts he sees
[1:35:06] our works which are a definite
[1:35:08] manifestation of what lies within us it
[1:35:12] is out of the heart that proceedes
[1:35:15] either righteousness or
[1:35:19] wickedness and I think it's pretty
[1:35:21] amazing how he's got this written here
[1:35:23] because I I mean we could have
[1:35:25] discussion about it I'm sure but we know
[1:35:28] that it's either good or evil there's no
[1:35:31] middle
[1:35:32] ground out of the
[1:35:35] heart precedes either
[1:35:37] righteousness or
[1:35:40] wickedness for me I just pondered this
[1:35:42] and and and think about it it's either
[1:35:45] right or wrong what's coming out of us
[1:35:47] our manifestation the life that we're
[1:35:49] living and we just need to make sure
[1:35:50] that we line up with the word you know
[1:35:52] we'll never do it on our own own we'll
[1:35:54] never be able to line up with the word
[1:35:55] on our own we'll try we'll try but
[1:35:58] brother bradam he said it we read it on
[1:35:59] Sunday that if we're just trying to live
[1:36:01] a Christian life then we're
[1:36:02] impersonating Christianity get the Holy
[1:36:04] Ghost when he the spirit of truth comes
[1:36:07] through our lives he
[1:36:10] manifest our motives our purposes are
[1:36:14] all known unto him as he watches every
[1:36:17] action and every action every word shall
[1:36:21] be brought into judgment when the
[1:36:24] accounting for our lives is
[1:36:27] given there was no fear of God before
[1:36:30] the false
[1:36:31] Vine and dearly they shall pay let all
[1:36:35] who name his name so live as becometh
[1:36:40] Saints we might fool the
[1:36:43] people but we will never fool the
[1:36:47] Lord I love that it just makes it so
[1:36:50] easy it makes it so wonderfully easy
[1:36:53] easy to just want to repent to just want
[1:36:55] to get right with God and make things
[1:36:58] right with the people around us and not
[1:37:00] try and keep things in our lives it just
[1:37:02] makes it so
[1:37:04] easy we have so much to be thankful
[1:37:08] for the promise in those dark days
[1:37:10] Revelations 2:2
[1:37:13] 24-2 but unto you I say and unto the
[1:37:16] rest in thota as many as have not this
[1:37:20] Doctrine and which have not known the
[1:37:22] depth of sin Satan as they speak I will
[1:37:26] put upon you none other burden but that
[1:37:30] which he have already hold fast till I
[1:37:34] come now before we go into the promise
[1:37:38] let me show again that the church has
[1:37:41] spoken of by the spirit in this book has
[1:37:44] two Vines whose interwinding branches
[1:37:48] compose it but I say unto you and unto
[1:37:51] the rest in thot tyria as many as have
[1:37:54] not this Doctrine there it
[1:37:57] is he is speaking to the two
[1:38:00] groups one has the doctrine the other
[1:38:04] has
[1:38:05] not there they are scattered abroad
[1:38:08] across the nations with each one's
[1:38:10] Doctrine opposing the other one is of
[1:38:14] God knowing his depths the other of
[1:38:17] Satan knowing the depths of Satan I will
[1:38:21] put upon you none other birth
[1:38:23] the word for burden is weight or
[1:38:27] pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages
[1:38:29] was either Bend or be broken bow or die
[1:38:33] it was
[1:38:35] Inquisition the power of the Empire
[1:38:37] backing up satanic
[1:38:40] worship be organized or pay with your
[1:38:43] life each age had its pressures for
[1:38:48] example a great burden of the last age
[1:38:51] is the pressure of riches
[1:38:54] soft
[1:38:56] living and nervous
[1:38:59] tensions in a complex age that we can
[1:39:03] that we can seem unfitted to live in
[1:39:06] anybody here ever been nervous ever had
[1:39:10] a nervous Spirit come on you and start
[1:39:13] afflicting you and make your heart race
[1:39:15] and make your mind go wild it's a thing
[1:39:19] that's the age we're living in it's a
[1:39:20] complex age
[1:39:25] this fourth age seems to have had a
[1:39:28] clear-cut burden it was to defy Rome and
[1:39:32] stand up for the word even unto
[1:39:34] death they have not known the depths of
[1:39:37] Satan it seems that this verse has been
[1:39:41] left out by some of the commentators for
[1:39:44] they were not able to figure out what
[1:39:45] Doctrine or what experiences are meant
[1:39:47] by this phrase actually it is simple to
[1:39:50] know what is meant let us first know
[1:39:53] what the depth of God is and the
[1:39:55] opposite will be true for the depth of
[1:39:58] Satan I love how he just continually
[1:40:01] continually brings the word of God
[1:40:03] Ephesians 3:16 to19 one of my favorites
[1:40:07] here he said that he would Grant who you
[1:40:11] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:40:13] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:40:16] in the inner man that Christ May dwell
[1:40:19] in your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:40:22] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:40:26] to comprehend we should be able to get
[1:40:29] this not be lost and and groping in
[1:40:32] darkness and looking and wondering and
[1:40:34] and have Mysteries no we should be able
[1:40:36] to comprehend with All Saints what is
[1:40:39] the breadth and length and depth and
[1:40:42] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:40:45] which passees knowledge that ye might be
[1:40:50] filled with part of the fullness of God
[1:40:56] no no with all the fullness of God right
[1:41:01] with all of
[1:41:03] God he was part in all of the ages but
[1:41:06] not this
[1:41:08] age now according to these verses when a
[1:41:11] man experiences the depth of God in his
[1:41:13] life it's an actual personal experience
[1:41:16] of the spirit of God indwelling him and
[1:41:20] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[1:41:23] and knowledge of God through the
[1:41:29] word but the depth of Satan will be in
[1:41:32] that he will attempt to destroy
[1:41:35] this he will as always attempt to make a
[1:41:38] substitute for this reality of God and
[1:41:42] that's all it is brothers and sisters
[1:41:43] it's not completely turning around and
[1:41:45] going backwards 180 degrees it's just
[1:41:47] simply making a substitute one word off
[1:41:50] oh you don't have to do that oh you
[1:41:52] don't have to say say that no you don't
[1:41:54] have to actually behave that way it's
[1:41:56] okay for you to just keep that that way
[1:41:58] that you just have it's okay no it's not
[1:42:01] okay every single Speck of the old man's
[1:42:03] got to go that's what the prophet
[1:42:08] said he says he will as always attempt
[1:42:11] to make a substitute for this reality of
[1:42:13] God how will he do it he will take away
[1:42:16] the knowledge of the truth of
[1:42:19] God destroy the word by putting forth
[1:42:22] his own yay hath God said and that comes
[1:42:26] in many many forms it can be in
[1:42:29] Tradition it can be in teaching most
[1:42:31] times it's in teaching it can be in
[1:42:33] Creeds and
[1:42:35] dogmas goes on to say he will then
[1:42:38] substitute the personal Christ in our
[1:42:42] Spirits making us think that we're saved
[1:42:45] making us think that we're religious
[1:42:47] making us think that we're covered that
[1:42:49] we have the blood in our lives he says
[1:42:52] he will do it as he caused Israel to do
[1:42:55] the same by a human being reigning as a
[1:42:59] King instead of God this Born Again
[1:43:02] experience will be rejected in favor of
[1:43:06] church
[1:43:07] joining thinking that it's going to get
[1:43:09] better the grass is greener on the other
[1:43:12] side if the word is the word is the word
[1:43:16] the depths of Satan had been entered
[1:43:19] into in that age and the fruit of that
[1:43:21] depth of Satan which are lies murders
[1:43:24] and horrible crimes came forth from
[1:43:29] it how much time do we have oh my we're
[1:43:32] going to get done here
[1:43:33] tonight the
[1:43:36] rewards and he that overcometh and
[1:43:38] keepeth my Works unto the end to him
[1:43:42] will I give power over the Nations and
[1:43:44] he shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[1:43:47] the vessels of a Potter shall they be
[1:43:49] broken to Shivers even as I received of
[1:43:52] my father and I will give him the
[1:43:54] Morning Star he that hath an ear let him
[1:43:56] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:43:59] churches he that overcometh and keepeth
[1:44:01] my Works to the
[1:44:03] end it is very evident from the remarks
[1:44:06] of the spirit on works that the Lord is
[1:44:10] trying to get his own to see his opinion
[1:44:14] of righteous works I love this four
[1:44:17] times he mentions
[1:44:19] works and now he says that he who keeps
[1:44:23] doing his Works Faithfully Until the End
[1:44:27] will be given power over Nations and
[1:44:29] will be strong capable unbending ruler
[1:44:32] who can cope so powerfully with any
[1:44:36] situation that even the most desperate
[1:44:39] enemy will be broken if need be his
[1:44:43] demonstration of rule by power will be
[1:44:46] like unto the very Sons this this is
[1:44:50] very amazing but let us look at this
[1:44:53] promise in the light of the age powerful
[1:44:56] Rome with State backing employing Kings
[1:44:59] and armies and
[1:45:00] legislators breaks and grinds all of it
[1:45:04] all before
[1:45:06] it she has killed millions and hungers
[1:45:10] to kill Millions more who will not bow
[1:45:13] to
[1:45:14] her she intolerably sets up Kings or
[1:45:18] brings them low whenever she can yay her
[1:45:22] inter ference has actually caused
[1:45:24] Nations to fall because she has
[1:45:27] determined to destroy the elect of God
[1:45:31] her works are the works of the devil for
[1:45:34] she murders and lies as did he but there
[1:45:39] is coming a day wherein the Lord is
[1:45:41] going to say bring these mine enemies
[1:45:43] before me and slay
[1:45:47] them then shall the righteous be with
[1:45:50] their lord when his righteous indign
[1:45:53] will fall upon the
[1:45:55] blasphemers the righteous coming with
[1:45:57] him in glory shall destroy those who
[1:46:01] destroyed the Earth and made Havoc of
[1:46:03] the saints of God this was the age of
[1:46:07] turning the cheek of terrible distress
[1:46:11] but the day is coming when truth shall
[1:46:14] Prevail and who shall stand in its fire
[1:46:18] and be safe only the redeemed of the
[1:46:21] Lord
[1:46:24] I am the root and offspring of David the
[1:46:27] bright and Morning Star Revelations
[1:46:30] 22:16 until the day Dawn and the day
[1:46:33] star arise in your hearts second Peter
[1:46:38] 1:19 and I will give him the Morning
[1:46:40] Star according to these scriptures Jesus
[1:46:43] is the Morning
[1:46:45] Star the spirit is therefore making a
[1:46:48] promise to the elect of the Dark Ages
[1:46:51] relative to himself
[1:46:53] and then in the ages to
[1:46:56] come I'll call the musicians as we wrap
[1:47:00] up
[1:47:00] here as we have already stated Jesus
[1:47:04] identifies himself with the messengers
[1:47:08] of each
[1:47:09] age they receive from him the Revelation
[1:47:12] on the word for each
[1:47:14] period this word
[1:47:19] revelation brings the elect of God out
[1:47:21] of the world
[1:47:23] and into full Union with Jesus
[1:47:27] Christ isn't that
[1:47:29] beautiful these Messengers are called
[1:47:31] stars because they shine with a Boral or
[1:47:34] reflected light of the sun even Jesus
[1:47:38] they are also called stars because they
[1:47:40] are holders of light at night thus in
[1:47:43] the darkness of sin they bring the light
[1:47:47] of God to his
[1:47:50] people this is the Dark Ages
[1:47:53] it is especially dark for the word of
[1:47:55] the Lord is almost entirely hidden from
[1:47:58] the
[1:47:59] people knowledge of the most high has
[1:48:02] almost
[1:48:03] ceased death has overcome vast numbers
[1:48:07] numbers of the TR of the Believers until
[1:48:10] their ranks are
[1:48:13] decimated the things of God are at the
[1:48:16] lowest EB to this date and it seemed
[1:48:20] that Satan would surely conquer God's
[1:48:22] people
[1:48:24] if ever a people needed a promise
[1:48:27] embracing the
[1:48:28] land where there is no light it was the
[1:48:32] people of the Dark Ages and that is why
[1:48:34] the spirit is promising them the Morning
[1:48:38] Star he is telling them that the chief
[1:48:41] star even Jesus who dwelleth in light
[1:48:46] unto which no man can
[1:48:48] approach will in the future Kingdom
[1:48:52] eliminate them by his own personal
[1:48:56] presence as I was studying this I just
[1:48:58] couldn't help but think that we're
[1:49:00] enduring we're
[1:49:02] experiencing we're privileged to see
[1:49:06] this he will not be using the Stars
[1:49:09] Messengers to give light in darkness any
[1:49:12] longer it will be Jesus
[1:49:16] himself speaking to them face to face as
[1:49:20] he shares his kingdom with
[1:49:23] them and we know that his kingdom is
[1:49:26] already here in the heart of every
[1:49:28] single True
[1:49:30] Believer it is the morning star that is
[1:49:33] visible when the light of the sun
[1:49:34] commences to
[1:49:36] shine when our son Jesus comes there
[1:49:40] will be no further need of
[1:49:42] Messengers he will bring us his message
[1:49:46] of cheer himself doesn't he do that now
[1:49:50] doesn't that happen every single time we
[1:49:52] think even about going to
[1:49:54] church and as he rules his kingdom and
[1:49:58] we live in his presence the light of the
[1:50:00] word will become brighter and brighter
[1:50:03] in our Perfect Day what else could we
[1:50:06] desire above Jesus himself is he not
[1:50:09] everything even perfect
[1:50:12] everything he that hath an ear let him
[1:50:16] hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:50:17] churches amen even so Lord God by thy
[1:50:22] spirit
[1:50:23] let us hear thy
[1:50:25] truth let's just stand and

[1:51:23] Death Angel was going through the land
[1:51:25] in Goan and father we know that there
[1:51:28] must have been checking and rechecking
[1:51:30] and ensuring that everything was in
[1:51:32] order father I pray that we would do the
[1:51:34] same with our lives Lord that we would
