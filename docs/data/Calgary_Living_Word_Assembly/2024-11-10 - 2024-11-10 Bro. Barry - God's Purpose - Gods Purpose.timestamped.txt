[41:30] would bless our service now that Lord as
[41:33] we've already heard that when we leave

[41:36] but we would consider the words that
[41:38] were spoken father help us all to get
[41:41] out of the way father that we could just

[42:44] brother there he is thank you
[42:53] Lord we know many times when the doctors
[42:56] say no that's just a opportunity for God
[42:59] to come on the scene we're certainly
[43:02] thankful for that answered
[43:05] prayer if you have your Bibles today I
[43:08] would just like to read a scripture
[43:10] that's probably very familiar maybe a
[43:12] little bit of a different direction but
[43:15] um as we're talking about on
[43:18] Wednesday um I just thought this would
[43:21] it it it I believe requires a little bit
[43:24] of attention so I just want to spend a
[43:25] little bit of time talking about this
[43:27] this and I trust the Lord will bless it
[43:29] in Romans chapter 9 I'd like to start
[43:31] reading with verse
[43:37] 1 Romans chapter
[43:45] 9 says I say the truth in Christ I lie
[43:49] not my conscience also bearing me
[43:53] witness in the Holy Ghost that I have
[43:56] great heaviness and continual sorrow in
[43:59] my
[44:00] heart for I could wish that myself were
[44:02] a cursed from Christ for my brethren my
[44:07] Kinsmen according to the
[44:10] flesh who are Israelites to whom
[44:13] pertaineth the
[44:15] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[44:20] and the giving of the law and the
[44:22] service of God and the promises my
[44:28] whose are the fathers and of whom as
[44:31] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[44:35] over all God blessed forever
[44:39] amen not as though the word of God hath
[44:43] taken none
[44:44] effect for they are not all Israel which
[44:49] are of Israel neither because they are
[44:55] the Seed of Abraham are they all
[44:58] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[45:04] called that is they which are the
[45:07] children of the flesh these are not the
[45:10] children of God but the children of the
[45:14] promise are counted for the seed amen
[45:18] for This Is The Word of Promise at this
[45:21] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[45:25] sonen
[45:27] and not only this but when
[45:31] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[45:35] our father
[45:37] Isaac for the children being not yet
[45:40] born neither having done any good or
[45:44] evil that the purpose of God according
[45:47] to election might
[45:49] stand not of
[45:51] works but of him that
[45:54] calleth it was said unto her
[45:57] the Elder Shall Serve the
[46:00] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[46:04] loved but Esau have I hated let's just
[46:09] bow one more
[46:10] time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[46:13] for your word thank you Lord Jesus that
[46:16] father you came and expressed yourself
[46:19] to this world Lord you chose a people to
[46:23] express yourself through and you chose
[46:26] father through election to see them
[46:29] blinded for our sakes Lord how could we
[46:32] not remember you father not just this
[46:35] weekend but every weekend of Our Lives
[46:38] father every day of our lives every time
[46:41] lord Jesus we open our eyes in the
[46:43] morning father let us remember Lord they
[46:46] were blinded for our sakes Lord those
[46:48] ones who had all of the promises
[46:51] according to the law but Lord you gave
[46:55] it to us father we just ask that you
[46:57] would bless the reading of your word now
[47:00] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[47:03] bless you this morning you may be
[47:08] seated just want to say God bless you to
[47:11] each
[47:12] one and uh I'm going to start something
[47:14] new I think it's important and forgive
[47:16] me for not really doing it effectively
[47:18] in the past but that's all I can do is
[47:21] say all I can do is go forwards and so I
[47:24] just want to talk about birthdays
[47:25] birthdays are important birthdays are
[47:27] the days that God chose to express each
[47:30] and every one of us on Earth on this
[47:33] side of Eternity and I think it's a it's
[47:35] an important thing that I have uh
[47:38] neglected to really deal with so as I
[47:41] said please forgive me as we go forwards
[47:43] I'm going to mention birthdays and uh I
[47:45] just would like to encourage perhaps we
[47:47] could reach out to one another and just
[47:49] say happy birthday God bless you we have
[47:52] access to all of this information on the
[47:54] uh the app if you had wondered so if if
[47:59] you're interested in seeing the exact
[48:01] days by all means go ahead and take a
[48:03] look last week we had uh three birthdays

[48:54] [Applause]
[48:57] I hope you brought your
[49:00] wife we just have a couple of
[49:02] announcements that we wanted to make as
[49:03] well we have uh what was the Youth Event
[49:07] who that has morphed into uh a financial
[49:10] session with brother Joel Clawson that
[49:12] will be in the basement on the 17th and
[49:15] that will start at 2 o'clock and I
[49:17] believe we have all of the logistics
[49:19] worked out for those people who are able
[49:21] to attend it will be uh definitely
[49:24] beneficial in terms of uh
[49:27] I believe it's investing now and we know
[49:29] brother Ram preaches on investments so
[49:32] it's not outside of the word so don't
[49:34] get nervous it'll be uh well worth it to
[49:37] come and and learn we have brother mvin
[49:40] Panetta he's going to take two services
[49:42] for us on the 17th and on the 24th and
[49:45] uh it's not because I'm leaving it's
[49:47] because he we've been talking about uh
[49:50] something for a long time for well over
[49:52] a year and uh we just felt led to do it
[49:54] now so on the 17th and the 24th of
[49:58] November brother mvin is going to take
[49:59] the services and then on December the
[50:02] 8th we have brother gift maruu will be
[50:05] here and he's a brother that was
[50:08] associate Minister I believe in
[50:10] Saskatoon Tabernacle and uh he actually
[50:14] packed up the family and moved back to
[50:16] Zambia I believe a year ago maybe a
[50:19] little over a year ago and uh he's
[50:22] attending a church in Luca Zambia and
[50:26] his Pastor is brother Ronnie
[50:29] Kisha I believe and that's at Hebron
[50:33] Tabernacle in luaka Zambia so our
[50:36] brother gift will be here on the 8th and
[50:39] uh I'm sure it will be a wonderful time
[50:40] he's back in Canada for a a couple of
[50:42] months I believe so now he's actually
[50:45] doing it the opposite to what he was
[50:47] doing God bless you Sister Mary he was
[50:50] actually uh living in Canada working in
[50:52] Canada and then traveling back to Zambia
[50:55] to minister for a couple of months and
[50:57] now he's living there and traveling back
[51:00] here to minister for a couple of months
[51:02] so it's interesting how it works we know
[51:05] God uh God has a way of doing things and
[51:08] it's always
[51:09] perfect the Remembrance Day weekend is
[51:12] upon us today this weekend I think it's
[51:14] a a wonderful thing to acknowledge and
[51:17] to recognize the reason we have freedom
[51:20] here in this
[51:23] country and I don't want to get
[51:25] political but I think it's amazing I'm
[51:26] just going to say this much I think it's
[51:28] astounding how people want to actually
[51:30] take and make the freedom that we have
[51:33] and turn it into some sort of
[51:35] contentious issue why would we do that
[51:39] why wouldn't we just say it's wonderful
[51:40] to be free and we don't have to protest
[51:43] do we have to protest do we have to try
[51:45] and cause a problem it just doesn't make
[51:47] any sense but it's just I just can't
[51:49] help but think it's exactly what brother
[51:51] bradam taught about how people would
[51:53] come out of denomination come right out
[51:56] of denomination and then in time given
[51:59] Freedom turn around and find themselves
[52:02] right back in bondage again of
[52:05] denomination and not recognize it if
[52:08] we're not careful we'll do that with the
[52:10] freedom we have in this country and I
[52:12] personally think it's already gone back
[52:14] there um but there's nothing we can do
[52:15] about that now we can certainly pray and
[52:18] uh we know we can never do that too much
[52:20] but you know there's a reason why we
[52:22] have the ability to have a free voice
[52:24] and that reason is because people gave
[52:26] their lives people actually picked up
[52:29] arms and went to fight and I wonder how
[52:32] many people today would have the courage
[52:34] to do what they did
[52:36] then how many of us would do that would
[52:39] say I might not ever see you again as a
[52:42] young man how many parents would be
[52:44] willing to part with their 16-year-old
[52:46] children to go fly warplanes to go and
[52:50] storm beaches to go and Fight For
[52:54] Freedom my
[52:57] I just think it's wonderful because it's
[52:58] not that far removed we talk about the
[52:59] children of Israel and their Wars and
[53:01] their battles it's not that far removed
[53:04] where we are today the reason why we're
[53:07] here is because someone fought and died
[53:09] and you know I I know many people who
[53:11] have grandparents who actually were
[53:13] there I can say my grandfather was there
[53:15] he he's got stories about being in in
[53:17] the second world war and they're
[53:19] shocking to hear but it's real and uh
[53:23] it's important to remember it's
[53:25] important to look back and thank the
[53:27] Lord for the freedom that we have it's
[53:29] important to look back and thank the
[53:30] Lord for the freedom not just to live
[53:32] and and work and and conduct ourselves
[53:34] but to have the freedom to worship
[53:37] that's part of our freedom is to have
[53:38] the freedom to worship the way that we
[53:41] feel led to go and the way we feel led
[53:44] to go is just amazing that's totally
[53:46] getting into our topic but you know it's
[53:48] just wonderful I I'm going to get into
[53:50] this a little bit later in the service
[53:51] but I'll just say it now the natural
[53:53] types the
[53:54] spiritual the natural typ types the
[53:56] spiritual and we fought a a a really
[53:59] tremendous battle to to go through the
[54:01] world war so that we could have our
[54:02] freedom now what are we doing without
[54:04] freedom I think is the critical Factor
[54:07] when we actually recognize salvation as
[54:11] Believers what are we doing with that
[54:14] freedom is it just something that we
[54:16] have and now we're a better class of
[54:18] people than many people in this world or
[54:21] are we willing to actually do a little
[54:23] sacrifice and share that that that
[54:25] freedom that we have with those people
[54:27] who are in bondage who really don't know
[54:29] about the freedom we have it's just
[54:31] becoming really uh pertinent to me about
[54:34] the City of Calgary where we live do the
[54:37] people in the city know about a prophet
[54:39] do they know God sent a prophet do they
[54:41] know that God sent a prophet to preach
[54:43] in this city in the
[54:46] 50s my I think it's powerful just want
[54:50] to say God bless you this this weekend
[54:52] and uh if you haven't really thought
[54:54] about it just take the time to remember
[54:57] why we have the freedom here there's a
[55:00] real purpose for it and a reason why we
[55:03] have it and and I just like I said I
[55:06] don't want to get too political but I
[55:07] want to say this it ain't so we can go
[55:09] and protest and say that we're this or
[55:12] we're that you know what we're
[55:13] Christians we're Sinners saved by grace
[55:16] man that's all we are oh my but once we
[55:19] recognize that it causes something to
[55:21] stir inside of us you know I I I'm going
[55:24] to talk today on God's purpose
[55:27] out of uh out of Romans chapter 9 verse
[55:31] 11 for the children being not yet born
[55:35] neither having done any good or evil
[55:38] that the purpose of God according to
[55:41] election might stand not of works but of
[55:45] him that calleth I just think it's a
[55:48] beautiful beautiful verse and it's going
[55:51] to sort of complement what we're talking
[55:53] about on Wednesdays out of the
[55:54] exposition of the seven Church a
[55:57] the sardan church age we're we're
[56:00] talking about what I spoke on Wednesday
[56:02] how I kind of got into the weeds in the
[56:04] afternoon I was studying this and I
[56:06] started to think my this is way more of
[56:09] a topic that should just be read over
[56:11] and we just go through it mechanically
[56:13] line by line in the exposition of the
[56:15] seven Church ages and we say we finished
[56:16] the sard of seean church age and you
[56:18] know we're going to move on to the next
[56:19] chapter and then before long we're done
[56:20] no I think we need to just pause here I
[56:22] feel really led to talk about this this
[56:24] is something that is very important to a
[56:28] Believer to recognize that God does the
[56:31] work and you know what I want to talk
[56:33] about today is the purpose of God God's
[56:36] purpose and that is really where we live
[56:39] as Believers in the day in which we live
[56:41] right we're we're dealing with
[56:43] everything is happening according to
[56:45] God's purpose there's nothing that's
[56:47] happening in this world that's out of
[56:48] control or by accident there's nothing
[56:50] that happens that's an accident in this
[56:52] world the world would speak that there's
[56:55] accidents oh my you driving in a car and
[56:57] somebody runs into you and you have an
[56:59] accident maybe you're driving home and
[57:02] and somebody is fleeing the police and
[57:04] they hit your
[57:05] vehicle and you have an accident we call
[57:08] them accidents there's nothing that's an
[57:11] accident everything that happens is
[57:13] according to the purpose of God and how
[57:16] we conduct ourselves in those moments is
[57:20] what demonstrates who we
[57:22] are God allows these things to happen
[57:26] but you know I want to say this brothers
[57:28] and sisters I'm going to I'm going to
[57:29] harp on this a little bit today I think
[57:31] it's real important this is a direct
[57:33] quote out of the message and it'll come
[57:34] up a little later you don't have to
[57:35] worry don't get nervous brother about
[57:37] trying to bring it up I'm just going to
[57:39] say it many times here we need to
[57:41] remember this brothers and sisters this
[57:42] is the prophet of God speaking he says
[57:44] I'm not saved today because I can shout
[57:47] many people can shout how many here can
[57:50] shout how many here like to get in
[57:52] service and Shout how many like to get
[57:55] into sports games and Shout you know
[57:57] what we can say I'm saved because I
[57:59] shout brother Bram saysi not saved today
[58:02] because I can shout I'm not Sav because
[58:05] I feel like I'm saved how many people
[58:07] feel saved today you can you can show or
[58:09] you don't have to show many times I'll
[58:12] tell you I don't feel like I'm
[58:14] saved I'm saved why because I've met
[58:18] God's
[58:19] requirements that's the what the prophet
[58:21] said I'm saved because I've met God's
[58:24] conditions of this Bible and I just want
[58:28] to stay there and dwell on that for a
[58:30] little while brothers and sisters I
[58:31] remember my pastor brother Ken he
[58:33] preached on this and he said it we need
[58:35] to know that that's how we know we're
[58:37] saved the devil's going to come around
[58:38] and say look what you did you don't feel
[58:40] like you're saved now nope I don't feel
[58:42] like I'm saved now oh you're not saved
[58:43] so you might as well just go and do it
[58:45] again don't worry about it you already
[58:46] got the condemnation who cares you're
[58:49] already there you might as well just
[58:50] stay there no the believer recognizes it
[58:53] and gets back up again amen and
[58:56] recognizes what the prophet said I'm not
[58:58] saved because I feel like it I'm not
[59:00] saved because of some sort of action
[59:02] that I do no I'm saved because I've met
[59:06] his requirements he said get baptized in
[59:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[59:11] the remission of your sins repent and
[59:14] get baptized and you shall receive the
[59:16] gift of the Holy Ghost and when you
[59:18] do then you know you've met his
[59:21] requirements and you know sometimes in
[59:23] that treacherous moment I'm going to
[59:25] call it a moment sometimes it's a day
[59:26] sometimes it's a month sometimes it's a
[59:28] year maybe a decade maybe 40 years who
[59:30] knows I'm not going to put it a time
[59:32] frame on that that moment from when you
[59:34] do all of the steps you've repented
[59:37] thoroughly you got baptized in the name
[59:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[59:40] remission of your sins oh my but there's
[59:43] that little Gap there where you shall
[59:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when
[59:46] do you receive the gift of the Holy
[59:47] Ghost when does that happen personally I
[59:50] I believe I know when it happens and I
[59:52] know the devil likes to come and say
[59:54] well you just haven't got it yet because
[59:56] of this and and maybe you don't have it
[59:58] yet because you'll know them by their
[59:59] fruit right what kind of fruit are we
[1:00:02] experiencing in our lives I want to say
[1:00:05] this the moment that you desire to
[1:00:08] earnestly do it with your whole heart
[1:00:10] you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] now some people might say brother Barry
[1:00:13] that's contentious I don't know how that
[1:00:15] can be I want to say this how many times
[1:00:17] do you really genuinely earnestly say I
[1:00:20] surrender all I surrender all the devil
[1:00:24] knows it and God knows it when you're
[1:00:26] sincere and when you're not sincere
[1:00:28] you're not going to get the gift of the
[1:00:29] Holy Ghost you're just going to be a
[1:00:31] church member and unfortunately when you
[1:00:34] get into that little treacherous spot
[1:00:36] that I was referring to between my
[1:00:37] fingers of all places it's just a weird
[1:00:40] example between going and meeting the
[1:00:42] requirements and then whether you get
[1:00:43] the Holy Ghost or not that's where the
[1:00:45] Devil comes around and just has a field
[1:00:47] day if you let him but if we can come to
[1:00:50] the place in our lives where we can
[1:00:52] simply say I'm not saved because of how
[1:00:54] I feel I'm not SA Sav because of how I
[1:00:57] act I'm saved because I met the
[1:00:58] requirements in this Bible like the
[1:01:00] prophet
[1:01:02] said I want to say this when we're
[1:01:05] willing to go there that changes
[1:01:07] everything because there's two classes
[1:01:09] of people in this
[1:01:11] world this is where we're going to go
[1:01:13] back to the weeds of Wednesday the
[1:01:14] Wednesday weeds you know what there's
[1:01:16] elected and not elected people period in
[1:01:19] this
[1:01:20] world there's elected and there's Not
[1:01:22] Elected and it becomes really
[1:01:25] treacherous to get into preaching this
[1:01:26] but I think it's important for us to do
[1:01:29] and it might take a few services and I'm
[1:01:30] not going to rush I don't think we
[1:01:32] should rush I think it's important to
[1:01:34] recognize because wow the devil is going
[1:01:36] to come around and say are you elected
[1:01:38] oh my you did this if you did that you
[1:01:41] couldn't be elected you would never do
[1:01:43] that if you were
[1:01:45] elected we got some examples in the
[1:01:48] Bible that I think are really important
[1:01:50] really worth taking a look at just
[1:01:52] remember brothers and sisters when the
[1:01:54] Devil comes around and says no you're
[1:01:55] not not say you know what yes I am
[1:01:59] because I don't believe the elected
[1:02:02] would ever not oh let me say it this way
[1:02:05] I don't believe the non-elect people in
[1:02:08] this world would ever desire to meet the
[1:02:11] requirements of the Bible they'll say ah
[1:02:14] no I've I've I've been baptized my own
[1:02:16] way I I don't believe that Prophet stuff
[1:02:19] no I I just can't see it the way that
[1:02:21] you talk about it brother Barry you know
[1:02:23] there'll always be an excuse some reason
[1:02:26] to not go all the way and be completely
[1:02:28] committed to the word of God but we just
[1:02:31] need to know that you know what if we
[1:02:33] have the ability to say hey I desire to
[1:02:35] meet God according to his conditions
[1:02:39] there's something special about that
[1:02:40] that the devil can't do nothing about
[1:02:43] that is a different thing
[1:02:46] altogether I had a quote come around on
[1:02:48] uh this week in in 1965 and I just think
[1:02:51] it's wonderful because it's it's what
[1:02:53] I've been preaching for a long time and
[1:02:55] I think it's important I'm just going to
[1:02:57] say it this is a prophet verbatim I
[1:03:00] don't know if I sent this to you it's
[1:03:01] out of Satan's Eden I heard brother
[1:03:03] Neville say Satan's Eden 19650 829 I'll
[1:03:07] let you bring it up I heard brother
[1:03:09] Neville say this
[1:03:12] morning I heard brother Neville say this
[1:03:14] morning I'm GNA stutter for a bit I
[1:03:16] heard brother Neville say this morning
[1:03:26] Satan's Eden
[1:03:30] 1965 I believe it's
[1:03:37] coming I heard brother Neville say this
[1:03:40] morning someone might have been asking
[1:03:42] him why didn't I preach on the Holy
[1:03:44] Ghost why didn't I do this here it is
[1:03:48] the Holy Ghost is the action in
[1:03:53] you it's the action in in you brothers
[1:03:57] and sisters we can say I'm saved I got I
[1:03:59] got God sent a prophet I believe the
[1:04:01] message of the hour all we want we can
[1:04:03] shout we can
[1:04:05] preach but what's the action in
[1:04:08] us how do we conduct ourselves how how
[1:04:12] do the people that know us the most
[1:04:15] intimately perceive
[1:04:17] us when we're behind closed doors do
[1:04:20] those people say you're a Believer or do
[1:04:22] those people scratch their head and say
[1:04:24] there's a mixed signal coming through
[1:04:25] through here I don't know man what you
[1:04:27] preach on Sunday is a little bit
[1:04:28] different than the life you live what
[1:04:30] you try and show the world around you is
[1:04:33] just a little bit different than what I
[1:04:36] observe because that's not the way it
[1:04:38] should be we should be the same same
[1:04:41] everywhere we
[1:04:43] go I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't
[1:04:46] I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:48] the action in you it's a life it's not
[1:04:51] an
[1:04:52] emotion because we can shout because we
[1:04:55] can preach that don't mean we got the
[1:04:57] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it's the
[1:05:00] life of Jesus Christ it's not an emotion
[1:05:03] not some sort of a fleshly evidence but
[1:05:06] it is the person it is a person Jesus
[1:05:10] Christ the word of God established in
[1:05:13] your
[1:05:14] heart you know what the evidence is
[1:05:16] going to be you're going to be able to
[1:05:17] go back to the word of God and say I
[1:05:18] don't know man everything around me
[1:05:20] seems to be confusing I'm going through
[1:05:22] the valley of the shadow of of death
[1:05:25] even I look around me and I can't see a
[1:05:27] way out but I know that I've met the
[1:05:29] requirements of
[1:05:30] God and that's where he's going to come
[1:05:32] on the
[1:05:33] scene but if we're not willing to meet
[1:05:35] him on his requirements then I don't
[1:05:37] know we might have a little bit of an
[1:05:39] issue the Holy Ghost is the action in
[1:05:42] you it's a life not an emotion not some
[1:05:44] sort of a fleshly evidence I don't go to
[1:05:47] church because I go to church I've been
[1:05:48] in the message for 40 years for 50 years
[1:05:51] my parents are in the message we do
[1:05:53] everything exactly right our whole
[1:05:54] entire Liv
[1:05:56] but is the message in
[1:05:59] you just being in the message ain't
[1:06:01] enough you've got to have that message
[1:06:03] inside of you and the message is Jesus
[1:06:05] Christ the Holy Ghost is the action in
[1:06:08] you it's a life not an emotion not some
[1:06:11] sort of a fleshly evidence some people
[1:06:13] might be saying brother Barry why you
[1:06:14] shouting why you getting so emotional
[1:06:16] because I think it's time we just get
[1:06:18] down to the nitty-gritty of this he says
[1:06:20] but it's a person Jesus Christ the word
[1:06:22] of God established in your heart to
[1:06:24] Quicken every word of this
[1:06:27] age not just something we preach we
[1:06:30] don't just quote quotes this isn't about
[1:06:32] just saying what the prophet said it's
[1:06:34] about living what he taught us it's
[1:06:37] about going on to meeting Jesus Christ
[1:06:40] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:43] when that happens something takes place
[1:06:46] but it's a person Jesus Christ the word
[1:06:48] of God established in your heart to
[1:06:50] Quicken every word of this age to
[1:06:52] Quicken every word of the prophet in our
[1:06:55] lives
[1:06:56] it quickens that word we say wow the
[1:06:58] prophet said it that is something that's
[1:07:01] incredible I don't understand it but I
[1:07:03] believe
[1:07:04] it because it's Christ inside of us the
[1:07:08] word of God established in your heart to
[1:07:11] Quicken every word of this age right he
[1:07:14] says
[1:07:15] watch watch the Holy Ghost In
[1:07:19] Action not so much in
[1:07:22] demonstrations but in action what it
[1:07:25] does according to the
[1:07:28] word that's what I want to say today
[1:07:30] brothers and sisters let's let the word
[1:07:33] be our
[1:07:34] barometer as we go forwards and we think
[1:07:36] about the message of the hour we think
[1:07:37] about our actions and we think about the
[1:07:39] life of Jesus Christ coming and
[1:07:41] manifesting in us are we manifesting the
[1:07:43] life of Jesus Christ according to the
[1:07:45] word or are we manifesting the life of
[1:07:47] Jesus Christ According to some Theory or
[1:07:49] or some man's Doctrine we know that
[1:07:52] Jesus came and he said you know what
[1:07:54] you're you're teaching for Doctrine the
[1:07:56] Commandments of men we don't want to do
[1:07:58] that that's not what the message is for
[1:08:00] it's not about dos and
[1:08:02] don'ts I got thinking about it and you
[1:08:04] know what we've been called to brothers
[1:08:05] and sisters we've been called to be
[1:08:08] Eagles right we have not been called to
[1:08:11] be
[1:08:13] legals we have not been called to be
[1:08:16] legals we can say oh my they eat with
[1:08:19] unwashed or they do this or they do that
[1:08:21] have they met the requirements of the
[1:08:23] Lord according to the word for our day
[1:08:27] where do we stand man we're called to
[1:08:30] soar into the heavenlies not be
[1:08:31] straining at a
[1:08:36] gat we need to be looking back to
[1:08:38] scripture here to see the reference I
[1:08:40] think it's wonderful talking about this
[1:08:43] this this Romans chapter 9: 11 for the
[1:08:46] children not being yet born neither
[1:08:47] having done any good or evil that the
[1:08:49] purpose of God according to election
[1:08:51] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:08:55] calleth
[1:08:56] as I talk about this I just have to say
[1:08:58] it I just can't help but think about it
[1:09:00] brothers and sisters where did Lazarus
[1:09:03] stand that day oh my when he was not
[1:09:08] standing anymore when he was laying in
[1:09:10] the tomb where did he
[1:09:13] stand there was nothing that he could do
[1:09:16] I think Lazarus is one of the greatest
[1:09:18] examples of election that we could look
[1:09:20] at in the Bible because there was
[1:09:23] nothing that he could do he was bound
[1:09:25] hand and foot his face was covered he
[1:09:27] was cold we know that in incorruption
[1:09:30] had set in 72 hours his nose started to
[1:09:33] sink into his face Lazarus was done
[1:09:36] for but something happened when that Man
[1:09:39] from Nazareth came by and you know that
[1:09:41] Man from Nazareth he didn't come by
[1:09:43] because people said oh you got to come
[1:09:46] Lazarus is dead he said oh okay what's
[1:09:50] for supper right just because you call
[1:09:54] doesn't mean he's going to jumped to
[1:09:56] action he's coming in his
[1:10:00] time sometimes Naturally Speaking it'll
[1:10:03] look like it's three days too late right
[1:10:08] oh my don't you know I perish Lord don't
[1:10:11] you know my condition don't you see the
[1:10:13] agony and the
[1:10:15] pain and they tried to call him didn't
[1:10:18] they they called him master your friend
[1:10:21] is sick unto death
[1:10:24] come even the sisters said you know if
[1:10:26] you would have been here this wouldn't
[1:10:28] have happened and weren't they right but
[1:10:30] what did Jesus say this wasn't all about
[1:10:32] just coming and and doing another
[1:10:34] healing this is the next level sister
[1:10:36] this is so that you could see the power
[1:10:38] of God that I am the resurrection and
[1:10:41] the life your works of righteousness are
[1:10:43] filthy rags before me what you need is a
[1:10:46] real experience with the Jesus Christ
[1:10:50] and what he did when he got there I love
[1:10:53] how brother Bram says that that woman
[1:10:54] says well there's no way that he could
[1:10:55] have been Divine Jesus couldn't have
[1:10:57] been Divine because he wept right he's
[1:10:59] God how could you put God in a box and
[1:11:01] say God should be a certain way and
[1:11:03] shouldn't be a certain way how could
[1:11:04] anybody ever do that the prophet in our
[1:11:07] day the word for our day said that he
[1:11:09] was all God yet he was all man and you
[1:11:12] know when he wept he wept emotion for
[1:11:14] his brother for his friend because he
[1:11:16] knew that this was not the way it was
[1:11:18] supposed to be from the beginning he
[1:11:20] created man to be
[1:11:23] Eternal he created man to be God and he
[1:11:25] could see the corruption that this world
[1:11:28] had taken on think about the weight that
[1:11:30] was on this man when he walked up to
[1:11:32] that tomb when he walked down there to
[1:11:34] see where his friend was laid he wept
[1:11:37] the Bible says he wept real tears he was
[1:11:40] all man he had the emotion in his heart
[1:11:43] oh my I can't help but think that he was
[1:11:45] all God at the very same time thinking
[1:11:48] Adam where did you go
[1:11:52] Adam but then we had the prophet say
[1:11:54] that you know they're came in moment
[1:11:56] what did he do he put his shoulders back
[1:11:58] that little nazarin put his shoulders
[1:12:00] back and it was no more man speaking it
[1:12:02] was God Almighty I am spoken that moment
[1:12:06] and what did he say he said Lazarus come
[1:12:09] forth and we know the prophet said
[1:12:12] something that many people many
[1:12:13] theologians don't even dial into and
[1:12:15] that is the fact that if he would have
[1:12:17] just said come forth he would have
[1:12:18] called the general Resurrection but what
[1:12:21] he did was he called specifically by
[1:12:23] name and I want to say today brothers
[1:12:25] and sisters if you have heard him call
[1:12:27] your name you can say that you have met
[1:12:30] the
[1:12:32] requirements otherwise you wouldn't be
[1:12:34] able to hear you wouldn't be able to
[1:12:35] hear what a prophet said you wouldn't be
[1:12:37] able to hear at all it would be on deaf
[1:12:40] ears you'd be like oh Lord would he just
[1:12:43] shut up and let me go
[1:12:45] [Laughter]
[1:12:47] home but if you can hear there's
[1:12:50] something
[1:12:51] special turn with me back to uh Genesis
[1:12:55] chapter
[1:12:56] 25 Genesis chapter
[1:12:59] 25 talking about this scripture here as
[1:13:02] I said I'm not going to rush I'm just
[1:13:03] going to take some time there's a few
[1:13:05] different angles that we're going to
[1:13:06] look at this from and uh today we might
[1:13:09] only just have one brief
[1:13:20] overview I just want to uh
[1:13:28] just want to
[1:13:30] mention this scripture
[1:13:38] here in verse 10 of Romans chapter n he
[1:13:43] just I know I know we turn to Genesis
[1:13:44] don't get nervous just stay there I just
[1:13:46] want to throw this in there as we go
[1:13:48] back Romans 9:10 says not only this but
[1:13:53] when Rebecca had also had conceived by
[1:13:57] the one even our father Isaac just the
[1:14:00] verse before what we're reading for the
[1:14:01] children not being yet born neither
[1:14:03] having done any good or evil that the
[1:14:05] promise of God according to election
[1:14:07] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:14:11] cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[1:14:15] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[1:14:18] have I loved but Esau have I hated so
[1:14:23] our scripture here in Genesis
[1:14:25] chapter
[1:14:27] 25 verse
[1:14:32] 21 the story of Isaac and
[1:14:38] Rebecca and Isaac entreated the Lord for
[1:14:41] his wife verse 21 because she was
[1:14:45] Barren and the Lord was entreated of him
[1:14:49] and Rebecca his wife
[1:14:52] conceived we know that word intreated
[1:14:54] means that he prayed he intercede
[1:14:58] interceded and God came on the scene and
[1:15:01] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:06] forever verse 22 and the children
[1:15:09] struggled together within
[1:15:11] her my and she said if it be so why am I
[1:15:18] thus and she went to inquire of the Lord
[1:15:23] and I think brothers and sisters that is
[1:15:25] something that we really need to make
[1:15:26] sure that we do and I know we do
[1:15:30] preaching to the choir here but maybe
[1:15:31] there's someone I know myself I can say
[1:15:34] that I need to inquire of the Lord many
[1:15:37] times where I just go to acting I just
[1:15:39] go to thinking I just go to pulling the
[1:15:42] trigger and doing things maybe I ought
[1:15:44] to inquire of the Lord
[1:15:47] first verse 23 and the Lord said unto
[1:15:49] her the two nations are in thy womb and
[1:15:54] the two manner of people shall be
[1:15:56] separated from thy bowels and the one
[1:16:00] people shall be stronger than the other
[1:16:03] people and the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:16:08] younger and so what I want to get into
[1:16:11] today is talking about the
[1:16:13] birthright you know brothers and sisters
[1:16:15] there's no election without the
[1:16:18] birthright what the birthright is an
[1:16:20] example of is election true but the
[1:16:24] literal life of Jesus Christ in the
[1:16:26] heart of an elected individual because
[1:16:29] an elected individual is going to desire
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:32] birthright but it's interesting because
[1:16:34] when we look at this story I want to
[1:16:35] continue on here
[1:16:37] reading verse 24 and when her days to be
[1:16:41] delivered were fulfilled behold there
[1:16:43] were twins in her
[1:16:46] womb so she went and inquired of the
[1:16:48] Lord and the lord gave her an answer and
[1:16:50] told her told her that there's two
[1:16:53] nations in your womb two people my
[1:16:56] goodness two classes of people verse 25
[1:17:00] and the first came out red all over like
[1:17:02] a hairy garment and they called his name
[1:17:04] Esau and after that came his brother out
[1:17:08] and his hand took a hold on Esau's heel
[1:17:11] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[1:17:14] was three score years old when she bare
[1:17:17] them and the boys grew and Esau was a
[1:17:21] cunning Hunter a man of the field
[1:17:25] and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in
[1:17:28] tents and Isaac loved Esau Esau was the
[1:17:32] Elder Esau was the
[1:17:36] eldest and Isaac loved
[1:17:40] Esau because he did eat of his
[1:17:43] venison but Rebecca loved
[1:17:45] Jacob interesting how this is this story
[1:17:49] here you know I I I was talking to my
[1:17:52] wife about this as I was maybe preaching
[1:17:55] a little before but I was talking about
[1:17:57] this and I always looked at the story
[1:18:00] one way one certain way until I really
[1:18:03] started to look at it through this lens
[1:18:05] of election as we're we're going today
[1:18:08] we'll carry on here in verse 29 and
[1:18:10] Rebecca sorry and Jacob saw pottage and
[1:18:13] Esau came from the
[1:18:16] field and he was faint and Esau said to
[1:18:20] Jacob feed me I pray thee that same red
[1:18:24] pottage for I am faint therefore was his
[1:18:29] name called Edom and Jacob said sell me
[1:18:32] this day thy
[1:18:34] Birthright and Esau said behold I am at
[1:18:38] the point to die and what prophit shall
[1:18:42] this Birthright do to me and Jacob said
[1:18:45] swear to me this day and he swear unto
[1:18:48] him and he sold his Birthright unto
[1:18:52] Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and
[1:18:55] pottage of lentils and he did eat and
[1:18:58] drink and Rose up and went his way thus
[1:19:02] Esau despised his Birthright and I want
[1:19:06] to say today how many
[1:19:08] people how many people according to
[1:19:11] scripture just like this allowed the
[1:19:13] natural circumstances of
[1:19:16] life to get in the way of their
[1:19:19] Birthright we know that brother bradam
[1:19:21] said it very clearly that Elvis Presley
[1:19:24] he took and and sold his Birthright for
[1:19:25] a fleet of Cadillacs
[1:19:28] amen what what price would we be willing
[1:19:30] to put on our Birthright today is there
[1:19:33] a price is there something that would be
[1:19:36] enough I remember when I was in the
[1:19:39] world that I would go through some
[1:19:40] really miserable times and many times in
[1:19:42] my my head and I just go into crazy
[1:19:45] story land in brother Barry's head but
[1:19:48] times I would think you know if I could
[1:19:50] just do this if I could just do that
[1:19:53] brothers and sisters there's nothing on
[1:19:55] this side of Eternity that would come
[1:19:58] anywhere near the value of our souls
[1:20:01] because that's really what our soul is
[1:20:03] in order to have our soul we have to
[1:20:05] have the birthright but here we have
[1:20:08] this situation where now Jacob and Esau
[1:20:12] are acting in the natural course of
[1:20:14] events a and it's the natural happening
[1:20:17] and he's so hungry he's going to faint
[1:20:19] he's going to die and what does he do
[1:20:21] he's willing to say the words I'll sell
[1:20:23] my Birthright
[1:20:25] for some food just to satisfy this
[1:20:29] natural situation this temporal natural
[1:20:32] situation in my life I'm willing to sell
[1:20:35] my Birthright who would say those words
[1:20:38] what that would mean today is is for one
[1:20:41] of my sons maybe Isaac being the oldest
[1:20:43] if I was going to give all of whatever I
[1:20:45] I have the little bit in this earth that
[1:20:47] I have my Earthly treasures and maybe
[1:20:49] any money and anything the name of the
[1:20:52] family all of the lineage would go to
[1:20:54] the Eld this son as the birthright and
[1:20:56] for him to say you know what I don't
[1:20:58] really care you know maybe Benjamin you
[1:21:00] can have the birthright if you want it a
[1:21:03] a as long as I can have some food that
[1:21:04] you're making because that smells really
[1:21:06] good what a terrible thing that would be
[1:21:09] what an insult that would be naturally
[1:21:11] speaking I I think it's just a terrible
[1:21:14] thing when we look at this here though
[1:21:15] we know the prophet said it many times
[1:21:18] the natural types the
[1:21:21] spiritual now we can take that and put
[1:21:24] it off to some other great spiritual
[1:21:26] Mountain somewhere in in the future or
[1:21:29] Look Backwards and say well I can see
[1:21:31] where it did it there but what about us
[1:21:33] right now today in our estate where
[1:21:35] we're at where we're living Our lives
[1:21:37] our families our jobs our careers
[1:21:40] everything that's going on with us in
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:43] moment the natural is typing our
[1:21:47] spiritual amen whether we want to admit
[1:21:49] that or accept that or realize that it
[1:21:52] it's irrelevant it's like saying there's
[1:21:54] no Gra gra ity the prophet of God said
[1:21:56] it and that settles it from my
[1:21:59] perspective but looking at this story
[1:22:01] here I think it's so interesting how
[1:22:03] it's just so easy to just pass off the
[1:22:06] birthright but you know we we can go
[1:22:08] further and I'm not going to do it today
[1:22:11] I I think it'll be well worth it if you
[1:22:12] want to see where I'm getting this from
[1:22:14] is just continue on and read the next
[1:22:16] couple of chapters the story we're well
[1:22:17] familiar with it how it seems like Mama
[1:22:21] Rebecca took and actually persuaded
[1:22:24] Jacob to be what brother bradam called a
[1:22:27] Shyer right we know the story very well
[1:22:30] how it was time to get the birth right
[1:22:32] and to add the blessing for the father
[1:22:35] and the father was going to give the
[1:22:36] blessing we know Isaac was going to do
[1:22:38] that and so what did he say he said Esau
[1:22:39] it's time it's time we need to actually
[1:22:42] get this going go and get me some of my
[1:22:44] favorite Venice and I'm going to have my
[1:22:45] favorite meal we're going to celebrate
[1:22:47] and when we do we're going to have a
[1:22:49] real spiritual time and I'm going to
[1:22:50] give the the spiritual blessing to you
[1:22:53] Esau and we know that mama got in the
[1:22:55] way and I had always looked at this from
[1:22:57] the perspective of Mama being deceitful
[1:22:59] and causing the son to be deceitful and
[1:23:00] yes indeed she did and yes indeed he did
[1:23:03] they they both worked together right to
[1:23:05] make that happen in a deceitful manner
[1:23:07] but what I didn't catch what I didn't
[1:23:08] realize and perhaps I'm the only one
[1:23:10] that wasn't really realizing this is
[1:23:13] that she was operating according to the
[1:23:14] Revelation that God already gave
[1:23:18] her she wasn't just pulling a fast one
[1:23:20] she was saying I know what God said to
[1:23:22] me and that's going to happen Esau is
[1:23:25] not going to get that blessing today no
[1:23:27] way not if I can help
[1:23:29] it the purpose of
[1:23:32] God the purpose of God this kind of
[1:23:35] shocked me I I'd never seen it that way
[1:23:37] before but I thought my my my my God
[1:23:40] will always have his will come to pass
[1:23:42] in every one of his elected children's
[1:23:43] lives there's no way that we'll ever
[1:23:45] escape that and you know the evidence of
[1:23:47] it will be our willingness to come
[1:23:49] according to the word for our day that's
[1:23:51] what's going to be the evidence we're
[1:23:52] going to be able to say I met the
[1:23:55] requirements we're not going to have
[1:23:57] resistance to it and say well I did most
[1:23:59] of them but you know I did them all
[1:24:01] years ago and maybe it was just a little
[1:24:03] bit different than the way brother
[1:24:04] Barry's preaching I want to say this is
[1:24:06] Brother Barry preaching any way
[1:24:08] different than what the prophet of God
[1:24:10] said I'll throw that out there and I
[1:24:13] just want to let it let it let it
[1:24:15] saturate let us think about that because
[1:24:17] if it is any way different then we have
[1:24:19] to have a
[1:24:21] conversation I want to say this the
[1:24:23] prophet said that that that we all want
[1:24:25] another that we ought to have a
[1:24:27] conversation to say you're preaching the
[1:24:29] doctrine wrong but if we are preaching
[1:24:32] according to what the prophet said
[1:24:34] according to what the truth of the word
[1:24:36] is have we come and met all of the
[1:24:38] requirements according to the word for
[1:24:40] our day because if we haven't I just
[1:24:42] want to say brothers and sisters it's
[1:24:44] not too late I don't think it's just
[1:24:46] brother Barry preaching here I think the
[1:24:48] Holy Ghost is calling he's still
[1:24:51] calling one of these days the Rapture is
[1:24:53] going to go the church will be gone and
[1:24:56] there'll be people that will say I heard
[1:24:58] about that I knew it was there but I
[1:25:03] just couldn't live it I want to say to
[1:25:05] you nobody can live it even those people
[1:25:07] that go in the Rapture the only
[1:25:09] difference is they recognized they could
[1:25:10] never live it and they just gave it all
[1:25:12] to God and every single day they tried
[1:25:14] to die out to themselves to say Lord not
[1:25:17] not me but you you live out through
[1:25:21] me looking back to the scriptural
[1:25:23] reference so I just think it's beautiful
[1:25:25] to see I I had always thought that the
[1:25:27] they were just deceivers deceivers
[1:25:30] trying to mess with that Birthright but
[1:25:32] no no no it was exactly according to the
[1:25:34] will of God God's purpose was being
[1:25:36] fulfilled you know talking about the
[1:25:37] birthright it's about the lineage and
[1:25:39] and typically it's the eldest male that
[1:25:41] takes the family name and and usually
[1:25:43] assumes the family wealth that's the old
[1:25:45] school way of doing things and maybe we
[1:25:47] do things a lot differently today and
[1:25:49] I'm not going to say one way or the
[1:25:50] other it's it's you know it's up to us
[1:25:53] to do what we need to do what we feel
[1:25:55] led to do but that birth rate is what
[1:25:57] we're referring to and in this
[1:25:59] particular discussion that's kind of the
[1:26:01] way it was it was exactly about the
[1:26:03] lineage of the name for the family and
[1:26:05] they would take all of the wealth and
[1:26:07] that was what was supposed to happen the
[1:26:09] Elder was supposed to get it but we know
[1:26:11] that she went and had a discussion with
[1:26:13] God and God said the Elder Shall Serve
[1:26:15] the younger and because of that
[1:26:17] Revelation she acted in her life and you
[1:26:21] know we have the order of birth we've
[1:26:23] talked about that
[1:26:25] we have the two people Isaac and Rebecca
[1:26:27] they're just trying to live their best
[1:26:29] lives they're trying to do everything
[1:26:31] they can according to the word according
[1:26:32] to the Revelation they've been given in
[1:26:34] in their lives but I just think it's
[1:26:36] wonderful how we have Isaac he went and
[1:26:39] he entreated the Lord he prayed and he
[1:26:42] asked and he acknowledged the Lord and
[1:26:44] and the Lord honored his prayer and we
[1:26:47] know that she had twins they struggled
[1:26:50] and and Rebecca she even went and
[1:26:52] inquired of the Lord and I think that's
[1:26:53] just such a beautiful beautiful
[1:26:56] description to see both of them Desiring
[1:26:59] to inquire of the
[1:27:01] Lord I think that it would help us a lot
[1:27:03] if we would be willing to do that if we
[1:27:06] would be willing to inquire of the Lord
[1:27:08] and I know most of us if not all of us
[1:27:11] have and do so it's a it's a tremendo
[1:27:14] tremendous thing for us to be able to do
[1:27:17] that Rebecca she wasn't
[1:27:21] deceitful not spiritually she had
[1:27:23] revelation
[1:27:25] according to the flesh she
[1:27:28] was this got me thinking how sometimes
[1:27:31] we can look at people we can look at
[1:27:33] situations and we can say that's
[1:27:35] deceitful that's not according to the
[1:27:37] will of God how do we know how do we
[1:27:39] know that's not according to the will of
[1:27:42] God I I know many times we'll say well
[1:27:45] it's not according to the word of God
[1:27:46] it's not according to the message of the
[1:27:48] hour and you know there comes times
[1:27:50] where we can say we have to say hey I
[1:27:52] can't explain it I don't understand
[1:27:54] understand it but I trust God because
[1:27:57] nothing's happening without him first
[1:27:59] allowing it to happen but Rebecca she
[1:28:01] was deceitful and she taught her son to
[1:28:03] be deceitful according to the flesh but
[1:28:05] she had already had this conversation
[1:28:07] with God and God spoke back to her she
[1:28:10] had this Revelation in her heart and I
[1:28:13] think it's wonderful when a mama gets a
[1:28:15] revelation in her heart ain't nobody
[1:28:17] going to talk her out of it especially
[1:28:18] when it becomes about her kids ain't
[1:28:21] nobody going to touch that Revelation in
[1:28:23] the heart of a Mama it's amazing you
[1:28:27] know out of demonology in the religious
[1:28:30] realm brother bradam talks about a
[1:28:32] little bit about election excuse me kind
[1:28:35] of going back to our
[1:28:39] discussion you know yeah I'll read this
[1:28:43] then we'll go back and read out of the
[1:28:45] exposition of the seven Church ages 1953
[1:28:48] 069 demonology in the religious realm I
[1:28:51] think it's so it's amazing
[1:28:54] isn't it that there would even be a a
[1:28:56] sermon title called demonology
[1:29:00] where in the religious realm what Bram
[1:29:04] he says in paragraph 63 there's a wheat
[1:29:06] field out here there's creepers nettle
[1:29:09] balls stink weed everything else in it
[1:29:12] is that right but now in there there's
[1:29:16] wheat there's wheat in that field we
[1:29:18] talked about it on Wednesday how you can
[1:29:20] have the what looks like the wheat and
[1:29:23] you put it in your hands it looks
[1:29:25] exactly like wheat but you look and
[1:29:27] there's no wheat there's no seeds it's
[1:29:29] all
[1:29:30] chaff but brother Ram here he's talking
[1:29:32] about there's a wheat field out here
[1:29:33] there's creepers nettle balls stink
[1:29:35] wheat everything else in it is that
[1:29:36] right but now in there there's wheat now
[1:29:40] the rain comes off upon the Earth to
[1:29:42] water it now we know that he's referring
[1:29:45] directly to I believe it's Romans
[1:29:48] chapter 6 I could be wrong with that I
[1:29:51] think it's Romans chapter 6 um anyways
[1:29:54] he's talking about the rain falling on
[1:29:55] the just and the unjust but now in there
[1:29:58] there's the wheat now upon the rain now
[1:30:00] the rain comes off upon the Earth to
[1:30:02] water it now what's the rain for not to
[1:30:05] water the nettle
[1:30:06] ball and and what we're talking about
[1:30:09] with the rain brothers and sisters is
[1:30:10] the latter rain call it the latter rain
[1:30:12] the former rain and the latter rain the
[1:30:14] the planting rain the Harvest rain call
[1:30:16] it the word of God for our day call it
[1:30:19] the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:30:20] age in which we live that's what we're
[1:30:22] talking about we're talking about this
[1:30:24] rain now what's the rain for not to
[1:30:26] water the nettle ball now watch and pay
[1:30:28] attention not to water the creeper not
[1:30:31] to water the unbelievers and the make
[1:30:32] Believers but to water the wheat to
[1:30:35] water the Believers to water the very
[1:30:37] elect of God that's what this word has
[1:30:39] been brought to this Earth for now watch
[1:30:41] and pay attention not to the water and
[1:30:43] Creeper the rain is sent for the wheat
[1:30:46] but the nettle ball and the wheed is
[1:30:48] just as thirsty as the wheat
[1:30:51] is the Believers and the unbelievers
[1:30:53] they're going to be drinking it up man
[1:30:54] they're going to be saying amen and
[1:30:56] drinking it up but you know what it's
[1:30:58] not up to us to try and discern who's
[1:31:00] who it's up to us to serve God according
[1:31:03] to the full Revelation in which he's
[1:31:04] given us not to water the creeper the
[1:31:07] rain is sent for the wheat but the
[1:31:09] nettle ball and the weed is just as
[1:31:12] thirsty as the wheat is and the same
[1:31:14] rain that falls on the wheat falls on
[1:31:17] the weed and the little old weed will
[1:31:20] stand right straight up like that happy
[1:31:24] and
[1:31:25] rejoicing just as much as the little
[1:31:28] wheat will stand up and stand himself
[1:31:32] up he
[1:31:34] says but by their fruits ye shall know
[1:31:38] them there you are
[1:31:40] see now the same Holy Spirit can bless a
[1:31:46] hypocrite I say Lord don't let me be a
[1:31:49] hypocrite that knocks some of you
[1:31:51] Armenians out but that's the truth the
[1:31:55] ones that believe it's all works I have
[1:31:59] tremendous Works in my life and I have
[1:32:02] my whole life and you could look at my
[1:32:05] parents Works my parents works are
[1:32:07] tremendous look what my parents have
[1:32:09] done for the message you know what that
[1:32:11] that's got nothing to do with it what
[1:32:13] are we doing in our lives right now he
[1:32:15] says that knocks some of you Armenians
[1:32:17] out but that's the truth that's the
[1:32:19] truth being taught Holiness which I
[1:32:22] believe in Holiness too
[1:32:24] but just because we're born into a
[1:32:26] message family doesn't mean that we
[1:32:27] automatically get the
[1:32:29] blessing but the Same Spirit the rain
[1:32:33] falls on the just and the unjust but by
[1:32:37] their fruits you shall know them just
[1:32:40] let that word fall down upon them let
[1:32:42] the word continually fall down upon them
[1:32:44] let the word continually bless them and
[1:32:47] and pour upon them he says if I look out
[1:32:50] here and go to get a wheat I get wheat
[1:32:52] but the weeds is all bound up and they
[1:32:54] live on the same rain that fell for the
[1:32:57] wheat and the rain was not sent for the
[1:33:01] weeds it was sent for the wheat but the
[1:33:03] rain being in the field the wheat being
[1:33:07] weeds being in the wheat field got just
[1:33:11] as much benefit out of the rain as the
[1:33:13] rest of them did and the same rain that
[1:33:17] made the wheat live made the weed
[1:33:20] live all things in the natural types the
[1:33:26] spiritual all things in the natural
[1:33:29] types the
[1:33:31] spiritual as we're teaching he says
[1:33:34] There It
[1:33:35] Is
[1:33:37] demonology demons impersonating
[1:33:41] Christianity yet with the
[1:33:44] blessing yet with a
[1:33:47] blessing
[1:33:48] my he says that's not skin milk Brethren
[1:33:52] if you can take it see
[1:33:54] now it's the
[1:33:56] truth and this just makes me shudder as
[1:33:58] I read it I think
[1:34:00] wow
[1:34:02] my so this is where we got that quote
[1:34:04] that I started with so so I'm I'm not
[1:34:06] saved today because I can shout I'm I'm
[1:34:09] I'm saved not because I feel like I'm
[1:34:11] saved I'm saved because I met God's
[1:34:13] conditions of this
[1:34:14] Bible Jesus said he that heareth my
[1:34:17] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:34:19] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:34:22] into the condemnation but as passed from
[1:34:24] Death unto life I believe that that's
[1:34:27] right and them conditions I am safe
[1:34:31] because God said
[1:34:33] so not because Church said so not
[1:34:36] because I said so not because Pastor
[1:34:39] said so or parents said so because God
[1:34:43] said so and that's where we need to live
[1:34:45] brothers and sisters we need to
[1:34:46] recognize it's all what he's done this
[1:34:48] is the purpose of God coming to pass in
[1:34:51] our lives giving him the opport Unity to
[1:34:54] do it he says if you told me you're safe
[1:34:57] because somebody said a rushing Mighty
[1:34:59] Wind hit me in the face that's wonderful
[1:35:03] but I want to know where that rushing
[1:35:04] Mighty Wind come from before it hit you
[1:35:06] in the face
[1:35:09] see now what kind of a life are you
[1:35:11] going to live after that rushing Mighty
[1:35:14] Wind has hit you
[1:35:15] see what kind of a life are we going to
[1:35:17] live brothers and sisters after that
[1:35:20] rain falls on the just after it falls on
[1:35:23] our life after we say Amen to the
[1:35:25] message of the hour we believe God said
[1:35:27] a prophet I've got the message
[1:35:29] Hallelujah I'm saved been baptized
[1:35:31] Justified Sanctified oh my filled with
[1:35:34] the Holy Ghost and live a little bit
[1:35:36] different than what the word says a
[1:35:37] little bit different than what the
[1:35:38] prophet says there's something wrong
[1:35:41] amen there's something wrong with that
[1:35:43] but boy when we line up with what the
[1:35:44] prophet says there's something right now
[1:35:48] don't get me wrong brothers and sisters
[1:35:50] we're going to stumble we're going to
[1:35:51] fall the difference between the believer
[1:35:53] ver and the unbeliever or the make
[1:35:55] believer is the believer is going to get
[1:35:57] back up again and say my Lord I'm
[1:36:00] sorry maybe a brother and sister my I'm
[1:36:04] sorry maybe a husband and a wife I'm
[1:36:09] sorry but when we start to see oh my I'm
[1:36:12] not sorry I got nothing to be sorry for
[1:36:15] what's that guy harping about why is he
[1:36:17] barking again talking like this over and
[1:36:19] over again when we start to see that we
[1:36:21] know there's something wrong
[1:36:25] but boy if we've had a wind hit us in
[1:36:27] the face my if if if he told me you're
[1:36:31] Sav because somebody said a rushing
[1:36:33] Mighty Wind hit me in the face that's
[1:36:34] wonderful but I want to know where that
[1:36:35] rushing Mighty Wind come from before it
[1:36:37] hit me in the face see now what kind of
[1:36:39] a life are you going to live after that
[1:36:41] rushing Mighty Wind hit you see see it's
[1:36:44] it's by your fruit you're
[1:36:48] known so demons can work right amongst
[1:36:52] Christians
[1:36:54] very important I'm I'm brothers and
[1:36:56] sisters some people might be getting
[1:36:58] upset with me right about now and I'm I
[1:37:00] I want to say I'd like to say I'm sorry
[1:37:02] but this is the word of God he he
[1:37:03] referenced the church not churches in
[1:37:06] the sardan church age we heard it on
[1:37:08] Wednesday because he said that the two
[1:37:10] would be so close that they would
[1:37:12] deceive the very elected those two twine
[1:37:14] Vines are intertwined and they're going
[1:37:16] to be that way all the way to the very
[1:37:18] end that's where we live and I think
[1:37:21] it's important to call it out it's
[1:37:22] important to understand exactly who we
[1:37:25] are and where we're standing today I'm
[1:37:27] not Sav today because I can shout now
[1:37:29] brother Barry is shouting so praise the
[1:37:32] Lord I'm not trying to demonstrate that
[1:37:33] I'm actually saved by shouting I'm just
[1:37:35] trying to preach I feel inspired I'm not
[1:37:37] saved today because I can shout I'm
[1:37:39] saved because I feel I'm not saved
[1:37:41] because I feel like it I'm saved because
[1:37:43] I've met the conditions of his Bible I
[1:37:45] know myself in my own life I can say
[1:37:48] I've met the conditions of his Bible and
[1:37:49] as soon as I was willing to do that with
[1:37:51] a genuine heart something changed inside
[1:37:53] me brothers and sisters I became a new
[1:37:55] creature in
[1:37:58] Christ and I believe we can all say that
[1:38:01] am I I I I I believe that every single
[1:38:03] one of us can say amen I know what it's
[1:38:05] like to not be the old
[1:38:09] man there came a time where there was a
[1:38:11] change in the
[1:38:13] birthright and you know the word of God
[1:38:15] says it I don't know if we'll get to it
[1:38:17] today but the word of God says there
[1:38:19] came a time where
[1:38:21] Esau when he came back from hunting
[1:38:24] maybe I'll just talk about the little
[1:38:25] story for a second we know that there
[1:38:27] was the deceitful part dad said Esau go
[1:38:31] get go get the venison that I love we're
[1:38:32] going to have a a ceremony and I'm going
[1:38:34] to pass off the birthright to you go go
[1:38:37] go get that Venison and cook it up just
[1:38:38] the way that daddy likes it and he said
[1:38:41] sure as an obedient son he went and Mama
[1:38:44] heard it and she said uhoh I better
[1:38:46] intercede I better do something about
[1:38:48] this God told me this isn't the way it's
[1:38:50] going to be and I can see what's coming
[1:38:51] around the corner here so I better do do
[1:38:53] something it's time to act and because
[1:38:55] she had that Revelation she did act and
[1:38:58] that's where the natural deceitfulness
[1:39:00] comes out and we can see it but we know
[1:39:01] what happened is they put the the
[1:39:03] clothes of Esau on him and they put the
[1:39:05] animal skin on his arm so he was there
[1:39:08] that hairy could you imagine how hairy
[1:39:09] that would be really to put the skin of
[1:39:12] an animal with hair with fur from a goat
[1:39:15] on your arm and that's pretty hairy he's
[1:39:18] a pretty hairy guy can't even imagine
[1:39:20] how hairy that would be but anyways they
[1:39:22] did that and he went in and he actually
[1:39:24] got the blessing from Daddy
[1:39:28] right but there came a time where Esau
[1:39:30] came
[1:39:31] back Jacob had already got in there as
[1:39:34] the Shifty one pulling the birthright he
[1:39:38] got in there got the blessing and he got
[1:39:40] out Mama helped him do it but there came
[1:39:43] a time where Esau came back and and we
[1:39:46] know that Isaac said to him who's here
[1:39:51] who is this and he said what do you mean
[1:39:53] who's this it's it's Esau the one you
[1:39:55] sent out I'm back now I've got the
[1:39:56] venison I I brought it for you Daddy
[1:39:59] this is what we talked about and we know
[1:40:02] it came out no no it's all already done
[1:40:05] sorry buddy you missed it
[1:40:08] man I've already blessed someone else I
[1:40:11] don't know who it was but I can only
[1:40:13] imagine he understood at that moment
[1:40:15] what was going on Isaac knew in his
[1:40:18] heart but the birthright had already
[1:40:20] been passed on and you know it's
[1:40:21] interesting because the natural types of
[1:40:23] spiritual yeah that's what we heard we
[1:40:25] understand that we all believe that the
[1:40:26] natural types of spiritual we know that
[1:40:28] Esau willingly gave up the birthright he
[1:40:31] he gave it up willingly just to satisfy
[1:40:33] this Earthly flesh and if we're not
[1:40:35] careful we will do the same thing I say
[1:40:37] Lord help me I do not want to pass up my
[1:40:40] Birthright for this flesh I want to say
[1:40:42] let this flesh perish so that I can hang
[1:40:45] on to that Birthright with all of my
[1:40:48] might but we know there came a time
[1:40:50] where Esau recognized what happened he
[1:40:53] recognized his error the word of God
[1:40:56] says that he came and sought that
[1:40:57] Birthright with
[1:40:59] tears and it was too late because that
[1:41:02] blessing had already been passed
[1:41:05] on the natural types the spiritual
[1:41:07] brothers and sisters if you look that up
[1:41:09] in the message it pops up nine times
[1:41:12] there's nine results the natural types
[1:41:16] the spiritual and I just think that it's
[1:41:19] real important I I felt led to just talk
[1:41:21] about this a little bit in this light
[1:41:23] that that we need to recognize the
[1:41:25] natural types the spiritual how are we
[1:41:28] living our lives today because how we're
[1:41:30] living our lives today whether we want
[1:41:32] to agree with it or not it's irrelevant
[1:41:35] argue with the Prophet The Prophet said
[1:41:37] the natural typees the spiritual how's
[1:41:39] our natural
[1:41:40] lives I want us to examine our natural
[1:41:43] lives how are they because they type our
[1:41:46] spiritual lives whether we want to
[1:41:49] accept it or agree or not it's
[1:41:51] irrelevant the prophet said it the
[1:41:53] natural types the spiritual nine times
[1:41:57] it comes up exactly that way today we're
[1:42:00] talking about election and the purpose
[1:42:02] of God God's purpose in our lives the
[1:42:05] purpose of God and you know election is
[1:42:08] a New Covenant word it's not in the Old
[1:42:10] Testament it's only in the New Testament
[1:42:13] it only pops up in the Bible after the
[1:42:16] resurrection I think that's so beautiful
[1:42:19] you know it's strongs g589
[1:42:24] long l l e l i don't know if I'm saying
[1:42:29] it probably not saying it right but it's
[1:42:31] from 1586 which means divine selection
[1:42:35] abstract or concretely chosen election
[1:42:39] so it's selection Chosen and whether
[1:42:42] it's abstract or concrete it's it's
[1:42:44] election it's it's divine intervention
[1:42:47] it's the Divine selection we couldn't
[1:42:50] choose to hear the voice of a Vindicated
[1:42:52] prophet
[1:42:54] I I would never have wanted to hear the
[1:42:55] voice of a Vindicated Prophet I remember
[1:42:57] hearing there was a Vindicated prophet
[1:42:58] in the land who could tell the secrets
[1:43:00] of people's hearts men's hearts in my
[1:43:02] natural flesh I remember very well
[1:43:05] vividly saying there ain't no way I'm
[1:43:07] ever going to get anywhere near that guy
[1:43:09] because he'll probably be able to
[1:43:10] discern my heart and who I am for real
[1:43:13] behind closed doors that nobody seems to
[1:43:16] know except for me I know I'm a skunk I
[1:43:19] never want to do that I would never have
[1:43:20] wanted to go and see a
[1:43:24] Prophet but you know what something on
[1:43:26] the inside of the inside said maybe you
[1:43:28] just want to take another look just take
[1:43:30] another look but you know in our
[1:43:33] scripture today Romans 9:1 for the
[1:43:35] children being not yet born neither
[1:43:38] having done any good or evil that the
[1:43:41] purpose of God according to election
[1:43:42] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:43:46] calleth talking about the purpose of God
[1:43:50] specifically the purpose of God
[1:43:52] according to elect
[1:43:53] in Romans chapter 9 I just think it
[1:43:56] brings out the thought it gives us the
[1:43:59] the ability to consider this you know
[1:44:01] what there's people that are not even
[1:44:03] born yet they've never done good or
[1:44:06] evil but God's purpose in their lives
[1:44:10] has already been
[1:44:11] determined and some people want to take
[1:44:13] it and say well because of that I can
[1:44:15] just live however I want to be and if
[1:44:17] I'm elected then I'm going to be there
[1:44:19] and I don't have to worry about it I'm
[1:44:21] just going to eat and drink and be merry
[1:44:22] for tomorrow I die because whatever it's
[1:44:25] too hard to live and it is too hard to
[1:44:27] live as human beings will never be able
[1:44:30] to live this but when Jesus comes into
[1:44:33] our heart oh my it changes everything it
[1:44:37] changes everything for us we become a
[1:44:39] new creature in Christ Jesus but you
[1:44:43] know because of election his elected
[1:44:46] will always come in line with the word
[1:44:50] always come in line with the word and
[1:44:52] that is the Difference Maker the elect
[1:44:55] will say maybe I don't understand it
[1:44:57] maybe I can't comprehend it but
[1:44:59] something on the inside just believes
[1:45:03] it and when we believe it we begin to
[1:45:06] live it we don't just say I believe it
[1:45:09] and then live a different life but
[1:45:11] talking about the purpose of God I did a
[1:45:13] little search on this in the in the in
[1:45:15] the Bible and uh you know we have our
[1:45:19] scripture in Romans 9:1 for the children
[1:45:21] being not yet born neither having done
[1:45:23] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:45:25] according to election might stand not of
[1:45:28] works but of him that calleth sorry this
[1:45:31] is on Election not not the purpose of
[1:45:34] God Romans 11:5 even so then at this
[1:45:37] present time also there is a Remnant
[1:45:40] according to the election of Grace I
[1:45:43] just can't help but think about the
[1:45:45] election of Grace in the heart of a
[1:45:48] Believer the election of Grace is God
[1:45:52] coming
[1:45:53] and giving us the ability to have ears
[1:45:55] to hear what the spirit says unto the
[1:45:58] church the election of Grace the ability
[1:46:02] to hear that God sent a prophet and not
[1:46:04] only hear that God sent a prophet but
[1:46:05] what did that Prophet say that Prophet
[1:46:08] said oh repent and get baptized in the
[1:46:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ no a
[1:46:13] trinitarian baptism ain't enough you
[1:46:15] haven't even been baptized at all is
[1:46:17] what the prophet said and when we hear
[1:46:18] that we say oh my really wow that's
[1:46:23] heavy but I want to take a look at it
[1:46:25] closer because if there is a furtherance
[1:46:26] to the word of God through a Vindicated
[1:46:29] prophet in the day in which we live I
[1:46:30] want to come in line with that word that
[1:46:33] is a sign of
[1:46:36] election but when we say oh my I've been
[1:46:38] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:46:40] the son of the Holy Ghost I've been
[1:46:42] baptized already well the prophet in our
[1:46:45] day said you haven't been baptized at
[1:46:46] all if that's how you've been baptized
[1:46:49] and I know myself that's where I was I
[1:46:52] was
[1:46:53] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:46:54] name of the son name of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:55] who's the father what's his name who's
[1:46:58] the son what's his
[1:47:00] name who's the Holy Ghost what's his
[1:47:03] name we know the Lord Jesus
[1:47:06] Christ he came and identified
[1:47:09] himself so that we could know who we're
[1:47:12] talking about I just want to read from
[1:47:15] the sardian church age in this book it's
[1:47:18] paragraph 111 it says now if language
[1:47:20] means anything at all we must admit that
[1:47:23] Judas was chosen by Jesus in John
[1:47:28] 13:18 yet he was not clean John 1310
[1:47:32] to11 Judas was also given to
[1:47:37] Jesus by the Father John
[1:47:42] 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the
[1:47:45] choosing and giving is the exact
[1:47:48] parallel as in the illustration of Moses
[1:47:53] Pharaoh Jacob and
[1:47:56] Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were
[1:47:59] both
[1:48:01] forn they were predestinated to
[1:48:05] wrath it's the sardian church age
[1:48:09] brother they were predestinated to
[1:48:14] wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob
[1:48:17] was
[1:48:20] glorified my first Peter 2: 8-9 you know
[1:48:25] I just can't help but think if we if we
[1:48:27] can really see that we're elected if we
[1:48:29] can really see that we've been chosen if
[1:48:31] we can really see that I can't imagine
[1:48:34] that we would ever come to a worship
[1:48:36] service ever again in our lives and just
[1:48:38] be
[1:48:40] quiet when we really recognize what God
[1:48:43] has done for us we just get our channels
[1:48:45] clogged up we get into this Human
[1:48:47] Condition and we get busy living and
[1:48:49] working and all the pressures of life
[1:48:51] and we go to church and then we go home
[1:48:53] and then we fellowship and then we go to
[1:48:55] work and and we do I'm talking because
[1:48:57] I've been there brothers and sisters
[1:48:59] some might say well brother Barry you
[1:49:00] don't even work you don't even hold a
[1:49:01] job you know what I know what it means
[1:49:03] to hold a job I know what it means to
[1:49:04] have a business I know what it means to
[1:49:06] work 16-hour days every single day I
[1:49:09] know
[1:49:10] that I know what it means to come to
[1:49:12] church with ch clogged up channels
[1:49:14] brothers and sisters oh my I'm not even
[1:49:16] going to say it as a deacon at the
[1:49:19] door you know sometimes being a deacon
[1:49:21] at the door I probably needed more more
[1:49:22] prayer than
[1:49:23] anyone I'm going to be honest with you
[1:49:25] brothers and sisters just because we
[1:49:27] have a position it doesn't mean nothing
[1:49:29] we need to recognize that we're elected
[1:49:32] when we recognize we're elected we're
[1:49:33] going to give due benevolence to the
[1:49:35] Lord when we come into his house we're
[1:49:37] going to acknowledge what he did for
[1:49:41] us according to election my they were
[1:49:44] predestined to wrath while the end of
[1:49:47] Moses and Jacob was glorification 1
[1:49:49] Peter 2:8-9 a shows both being
[1:49:54] reprobates and elect even to them which
[1:49:58] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:50:01] where unto also they were
[1:50:04] appointed so if we see someone stumbling
[1:50:07] at the word brothers and sisters we
[1:50:09] don't want to throw off on
[1:50:11] them that could be their their
[1:50:14] calling that could be what their
[1:50:17] chosen to
[1:50:19] do but ye brothers and sisters
[1:50:23] are a chosen
[1:50:24] generation Judas was numbered with the
[1:50:27] 12 and actually had a part with them in
[1:50:30] the
[1:50:31] ministry previous to
[1:50:33] Pentecost my just because we have a
[1:50:37] position it don't mean
[1:50:39] nothing just because we can preach this
[1:50:41] gospel brothers and sisters it don't
[1:50:43] mean nothing does our life line up do we
[1:50:48] line up with this word are we willing to
[1:50:51] Humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:50:53] Lord are we willing to submit ourselves
[1:50:56] one to another in the fear of
[1:50:59] God if we're not I want to say there's
[1:51:03] something
[1:51:05] wrong Romans 11:5 even so then at this
[1:51:09] present time also there is a Remnant
[1:51:11] according to the election of Grace God's
[1:51:15] grace to us understanding that it ain't
[1:51:16] our works it's not by works of
[1:51:18] righteousness brothers and sisters it's
[1:51:21] just by his grace alone that's the only
[1:51:23] reason we can understand God sent a
[1:51:25] prophet that's the only reason that we
[1:51:27] can hear what the spirit says that's the
[1:51:28] only reason we are who we are it's
[1:51:31] because of his grace unto us and that
[1:51:33] causes something to stir inside of our
[1:51:36] hearts Romans 117 what then Israel hath
[1:51:40] not obtained to that which he seeketh
[1:51:43] for but the election hath obtained it
[1:51:47] and the rest were
[1:51:48] blinded my the election hath a obtained
[1:51:52] it and the rest were blinded who's the
[1:51:56] election it's not it's not in the book
[1:51:58] brother it's a scripture it's a
[1:52:01] scripture Romans 11:7 Romans 11:28 as
[1:52:05] concerning the gospel they are enemies
[1:52:07] for your
[1:52:09] sakes but as touching
[1:52:11] election they are beloved for the
[1:52:13] father's
[1:52:14] sakes
[1:52:16] my that's where I I just want to say
[1:52:19] this I can't I can't believe anyone
[1:52:21] would ever throw off on the Jews
[1:52:23] ever especially someone who would be of
[1:52:26] the
[1:52:27] faith if someone is a Believer we should
[1:52:31] understand that they have been called to
[1:52:33] be
[1:52:34] blinded they've been called to be
[1:52:36] blinded why so that we could be
[1:52:39] recipients of this Grace the election of
[1:52:43] Grace it's not because of what we've
[1:52:45] done it's because he chose us in him
[1:52:48] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:52:50] the ones today
[1:52:53] in 1 Thessalonians
[1:52:54] 4 knowing Brethren
[1:52:57] beloved your election of
[1:53:01] God there's a discussion about
[1:53:03] election we'll get further into this as
[1:53:06] we go maybe not today but in the future
[1:53:09] for sure second Peter 1 verse 10
[1:53:12] wherefore the rather
[1:53:15] Brethren wherefore the rather Brethren
[1:53:19] give
[1:53:20] diligence to make your calling in ction
[1:53:24] sure for if you do these things you
[1:53:27] shall never
[1:53:29] fall I I I just want to turn over there
[1:53:32] for a
[1:53:34] second if you don't mind let's turn to
[1:53:36] Second
[1:53:44] Peter got a couple minutes left before
[1:53:47] we have
[1:53:49] to wind it down
[1:53:58] did I say four second Peter chapter 1
[1:54:01] forgive
[1:54:08] me we know we just
[1:54:10] read verse 10 wherefore the rather
[1:54:14] Brethren give diligence to make your
[1:54:16] calling an election
[1:54:17] sure for if you do these things you
[1:54:20] shall never fall
[1:54:22] I just want to talk about these things
[1:54:25] what are these
[1:54:27] things I think it's really important
[1:54:30] because these things are really only for
[1:54:32] the
[1:54:34] elected there's a lot of people that
[1:54:36] want these things in their life and
[1:54:38] they'll work really hard to have these
[1:54:39] things and from an outwardly perspective
[1:54:42] will demonstrate a lot of these things
[1:54:45] but you know what the true evidence is
[1:54:46] is the ability to come according to the
[1:54:48] word for our day if we just go back to
[1:54:52] Let's just read verse
[1:54:53] one of second Peter chapter 1 Simon
[1:54:56] Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[1:54:58] Christ to them that have obtained like
[1:55:01] Precious Faith with us through the
[1:55:03] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:55:06] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[1:55:09] multiplied unto you through the
[1:55:11] knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[1:55:14] lord according as his divine power hath
[1:55:18] given unto us all things that pertain
[1:55:22] unto life and godliness through the
[1:55:25] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[1:55:27] glory and virtue not because of anything
[1:55:31] we've done because of what he's done
[1:55:34] wherefore are given unto us exceeding
[1:55:38] great and precious
[1:55:41] promises that by these ye might be
[1:55:45] partakers of the divine
[1:55:47] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:55:50] that is in the world through
[1:55:54] lust and we know that there's a couple
[1:55:56] different types of lust I'm not going to
[1:55:58] go too far into that it's not just a a
[1:56:00] fleshly lust it's the lust of the mind
[1:56:02] we can have that as well but he goes on
[1:56:05] to talk here in verse 5 and he says
[1:56:07] beside this giving all diligence all
[1:56:11] diligence brothers and sisters add to
[1:56:13] your faith virtue strength and add to
[1:56:17] your strength
[1:56:20] knowledge and to your knowledge
[1:56:23] Temperance or or or the ability to just
[1:56:28] withhold withstand not actually
[1:56:31] overindulge to your knowledge Temperance
[1:56:33] and to Temperance
[1:56:35] patience not just fly off the
[1:56:38] handle but be patient and wait for the
[1:56:41] promise of God to come to pass in our
[1:56:42] lives patience and to patience
[1:56:46] godliness we know that's Holiness and to
[1:56:48] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:56:51] brotherly kindness
[1:56:52] charity for if these things be in you
[1:56:56] and
[1:56:57] abound they make you that you shall
[1:56:59] neither be
[1:57:00] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:57:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know
[1:57:05] that this is the statue of the perfect
[1:57:07] man the statute of the perfect man this
[1:57:10] is the pyramid that we typically so
[1:57:12] often see and I love how brother mvin
[1:57:14] brought it as one pyramid now it's not
[1:57:16] separate with the Holy Ghost on top the
[1:57:18] two have become one the the twain are
[1:57:20] one right the husband and and wife there
[1:57:23] is a new life there's there's there's
[1:57:25] something that's happened and they have
[1:57:27] become intimate but you know talking
[1:57:30] about these things if they be in us and
[1:57:31] abound then we should never be Barren
[1:57:33] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[1:57:35] Lord Jesus Christ and and will never
[1:57:37] fall brothers and sisters if we have
[1:57:39] these things in our lives but what are
[1:57:41] these things it's not like the pyramid
[1:57:43] it's not a pyramid
[1:57:45] scheme right don't think of it in terms
[1:57:48] of a pyramid scheme you're not just
[1:57:49] going to climb up on one and then onto
[1:57:51] the other onto Faith you're going to add
[1:57:53] virtue and virtue knowledge knowledge
[1:57:55] Temperance and patience and godliness
[1:57:58] and and no no no no no get the Holy
[1:58:00] Ghost in your life when you get the Holy
[1:58:02] Ghost in your life all of those things
[1:58:04] come into your life with that life of
[1:58:06] the Holy Ghost and there will be things
[1:58:08] along the way that you'll start to see
[1:58:10] wow I've got patience where I never had
[1:58:12] patience before whoa I've got strength
[1:58:14] to go on my knees and pray where I never
[1:58:16] used to be able to have that strength
[1:58:17] and go and take time to pray my goodness
[1:58:21] I've got got knowledge about the word of
[1:58:23] God where did that come from people will
[1:58:25] say to you how do you know about the
[1:58:26] word of God so much oh my because
[1:58:29] someone else inside of me knows about
[1:58:31] that word that that that someone else is
[1:58:34] the word and that's why I have that but
[1:58:37] Temperance my goodness the things that I
[1:58:39] just couldn't resist in the past I can
[1:58:42] leave them alone I can say you know what
[1:58:43] I can just maybe have one Burger instead
[1:58:46] of four right there's something holding
[1:58:49] me back something giving me the the
[1:58:52] restraint I've never eaten four burgers
[1:58:54] at once just for the record I might look
[1:58:56] like it but I don't think I ever could
[1:58:58] but you know these things in our lives
[1:59:00] if we can see these in our lives
[1:59:01] brothers and sisters and abound they'll
[1:59:04] make you that you shall NE never be
[1:59:05] Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[1:59:08] our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath
[1:59:10] these things is
[1:59:12] blind and cannot see a far
[1:59:15] off and this I can't help but think
[1:59:17] brothers and sisters this ain't talking
[1:59:19] about a rank unbeliever this is talking
[1:59:20] about someone that maybe has just taken
[1:59:22] a little bit of a detour someone who is
[1:59:24] a Believer that's just become maybe
[1:59:27] maybe a little unsure of their position
[1:59:30] but he that lath these things is blind
[1:59:32] cannot see a far off and hath forgotten
[1:59:34] that he was purged of his old
[1:59:37] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:59:40] diligence be diligent about it take care
[1:59:43] is what my Bible says diligence means
[1:59:46] take care to make your calling and
[1:59:48] election sure for if ye do these things
[1:59:51] ye shall never
[1:59:54] fall I just can't help but think that's
[1:59:56] the most beautiful thought there's
[1:59:57] something that's going to cause me to
[1:59:59] never
[2:00:00] fall did you ever think of it that way
[2:00:03] there's something that's going to cause
[2:00:04] us to never fall we'll be able to see it
[2:00:06] naturally in our lives I will never
[2:00:09] fall
[2:00:12] wow I just want to say this get the Holy
[2:00:14] Ghost in your life and you'll see all of
[2:00:16] these
[2:00:17] things manifest you can't have the Holy
[2:00:20] Ghost in your life and not see these
[2:00:21] things manifest
[2:00:23] it's
[2:00:25] impossible so you know brothers and
[2:00:27] sisters I'll call the musicians because
[2:00:30] I don't want to take us too long here
[2:00:33] today we look at all these things we
[2:00:36] talk about the elected we haven't even
[2:00:38] really scratched the surface of election
[2:00:41] I believe and I don't know if we'll ever
[2:00:43] be able to do it justice or I will be
[2:00:46] able to do it justice there's probably
[2:00:47] someone that could who is a very good
[2:00:50] teacher but speaking about election
[2:00:53] there might be someone here today who is
[2:00:55] wondering who is elected
[2:00:57] then who is it that would be the truly
[2:01:01] elected because we know that the word of
[2:01:04] God would be so close so close that it
[2:01:08] would deceive the very elected if it
[2:01:11] were
[2:01:11] possible but it can't it will never be
[2:01:15] able to deceive the very elected but who
[2:01:17] is the truly elected I'm so thankful
[2:01:20] that we had a prophet in our day come
[2:01:22] and and identify who the elected are the
[2:01:25] elected are the ones that have the Holy
[2:01:28] Ghost because you will never get the
[2:01:30] Holy Ghost in your life If You're Not
[2:01:32] Elected that's just not going to happen
[2:01:34] you'll be able to live under the
[2:01:35] anointing of the Holy Ghost you'll be
[2:01:37] able to come to a church
[2:01:38] service and Thrive off of the anointing
[2:01:42] in the church service and say my it was
[2:01:44] so good to be in his presence and that's
[2:01:46] what everyone says even the elected say
[2:01:48] that it's so good to be in his presence
[2:01:52] but you know brothers and sisters we
[2:01:53] don't just come and experience his
[2:01:55] presence here we take his presence with
[2:01:57] us we bring his presence into the
[2:02:01] sanctuary it's not about coming to
[2:02:04] experience it it's about being the
[2:02:06] experience my who is the elected then
[2:02:09] it's the people who come according to
[2:02:11] his word and his word alone and the word
[2:02:14] for our day the prophet's word the word
[2:02:16] that God gave a prophet that God
[2:02:18] Vindicated a prophet that word that's
[2:02:22] going to be the identification of who
[2:02:23] the elected is then even if it takes our
[2:02:26] hide off even if we say brother I just
[2:02:29] can't hardly stand that that hurts I
[2:02:31] know I've got these things in my life
[2:02:33] you know what I got things in my life
[2:02:34] brothers and sisters I'm not claiming to
[2:02:36] be anyone I'm I'm a sinner saved by
[2:02:39] grace and if I don't guard my weak spots
[2:02:42] I've got problems we need to guard our
[2:02:45] weaknesses if we're not willing to do
[2:02:47] that the devil's going to have a field
[2:02:48] day with us but who is the elected the
[2:02:51] people who are willing to come solely
[2:02:53] according to his word and if we have
[2:02:56] something where we hear we need
[2:02:58] correction in our lives the elected is
[2:03:01] going to say amen amen forgive me Lord I
[2:03:05] I just want to be right with you I don't
[2:03:07] want to try and pretend I don't want to
[2:03:09] have to ever go down to the river we
[2:03:10] know brother Bram gives that story about
[2:03:12] the man standing there at the river he
[2:03:14] goes down and he knows he needs to have
[2:03:15] that token in his hand and if he doesn't
[2:03:17] have that token in his hand he's going
[2:03:18] to have trouble crossing the river that
[2:03:20] day there's coming a time where we're
[2:03:21] we're potentially going to go by the way
[2:03:23] of the Grave are we going to know where
[2:03:24] we're going to go we don't want to have
[2:03:27] any trouble then we've heard it said
[2:03:29] many times there's a time in our lives
[2:03:32] where our body starts to separate
[2:03:35] Body Spirit and soul and when that
[2:03:39] happens what's going to happen it's
[2:03:41] going to be too late to make a decision
[2:03:43] it's going to be too late to cry out to
[2:03:45] God that's why we've got the opportunity
[2:03:47] now just to say like Mary be it unto me
[2:03:50] according to Thy Word and you know
[2:03:53] unfortunately unfortunately for this
[2:03:55] whole entire world there isn't going to
[2:03:56] be any excuses God's only going to judge
[2:03:58] the World by his word maybe stand with
[2:04:00] me as we close today he's going to judge
[2:04:02] the World by his word that's it that is
[2:04:05] the
[2:04:06] measuring stick that's how he's going to
[2:04:08] judge the World by his word and there
[2:04:10] isn't going to be any excuses we're not
[2:04:12] going to be able to say there's there's
[2:04:14] this or that or the
[2:04:20] other amen
[2:04:23] it's not by anything that I've done it's
[2:04:24] by his grace alone that I can meet his
[2:04:27] requirements you know I'm going to close
[2:04:29] with one quote did you get the quotes
[2:04:31] the email this morning brother it's the
[2:04:33] last one 1963 I am the resurrection and
[2:04:38] life brother bramy says so is it my
[2:04:41] friends we are here this afternoon to
[2:04:43] see what death has done to our brother
[2:04:46] it's got to be German
[2:04:48] gerti not germanized gered
[2:04:51] forgive me we might belong to church we
[2:04:55] might be fine people we might be a good
[2:04:58] character in the neighborhood a fine
[2:04:59] father mother son daughter but unless we
[2:05:02] are
[2:05:10] deratization it's
[2:05:12] finished it speaks to us of these things
[2:05:16] nature calls out day by day and the sun
[2:05:18] rises and sets the moon and stars come
[2:05:20] out the same thing everything in nature
[2:05:22] revolves in one thing death burial
[2:05:25] Resurrection death burial Resurrection
[2:05:26] every day of our life something is to
[2:05:28] testify to us death burial Resurrection
[2:05:31] we walk over the top of it many times
[2:05:33] let's not do that let's not why it was
[2:05:36] set here and the world set in order like
[2:05:40] that it's for eternal life that we know
[2:05:43] and seeing seeing upon seeds that
[2:05:46] they're not
[2:05:48] gerti and serve the purpose of God it
[2:05:51] cannot rise neither will We rise amen
[2:05:55] though we be good people though we be
[2:05:58] church members though we be Gallant
[2:06:00] neighbors find people educated smart
[2:06:03] science tells us what has been science
[2:06:06] can't give us life life belongs to God
[2:06:10] alone and he's the only one handles life
[2:06:13] so we must come to that place to be jti
[2:06:16] by the word of God or we will never rise
[2:06:19] again our life is totally finished when
[2:06:23] we finish this life here that does it
[2:06:25] all together if we're not gerti by the
[2:06:28] word of God or by the life of God
[2:06:32] brothers and sisters it can't be
[2:06:33] anything that a church does for us can't
[2:06:36] be anything that our parents do for us
[2:06:38] it's got to be what he does for us I
[2:06:41] just can't help but think about this one
[2:06:43] scripture and I'm going to
[2:06:45] close 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23 it says
[2:06:51] and the Very God of Peace sanctify you
[2:06:54] holy the very God of Peace will look
[2:06:56] after all of it in your body in your
[2:06:58] mind in your soul all of it he will
[2:07:00] sanctify you holy every part of you and
[2:07:03] I pray God your whole spirit and soul
[2:07:06] and body be preserved blameless unto the
[2:07:09] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ can you
[2:07:11] imagine that brothers and sisters God he
[2:07:14] is the one who answers prayers and this
[2:07:16] is a prayer of this saint and he said I
[2:07:19] pray God your your whole Spirit soul and
[2:07:23] body be preserved blameless unto the
[2:07:25] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ you had
[2:07:27] someone praying for you before the
[2:07:29] foundation of the world you had someone
[2:07:30] praying for you before you even express
[2:07:33] before we even a thought in our parents'
[2:07:35] Minds someone was praying for us and
[2:07:39] this next verse is the critical Factor
[2:07:40] brothers and sisters Faithful Is He that
[2:07:43] calleth you who will also do
[2:07:46] it as much as we want to do it there
[2:07:48] ain't nothing that we can ever do it's
