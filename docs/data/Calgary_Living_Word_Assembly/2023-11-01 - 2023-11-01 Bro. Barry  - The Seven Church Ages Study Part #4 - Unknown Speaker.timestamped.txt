[36:32] want to remind everyone that uh we have
[36:34] a time change happening this Sunday
[36:37] Saturday actually Saturday morning
[36:38] Saturday Sunday morning Saturday night
[36:41] when you go to bed set your clock's back
[36:43] an hour our phones tend to do it
[36:45] automatically and that's real convenient
[36:48] uh we have a communion service on
[36:49] November the 12th at 6 PM Sunday
[36:52] November the
[36:54] 12th and uh we heard yesterday that it
[36:57] sounds like brother Timothy ashong will
[36:59] come and visit us as well and I think
[37:03] that he'll be here December the 6 if
[37:05] that works out we're planning for that
[37:07] so just a few things to keep in mind we
[37:10] had a wonderful time last night
[37:12] gathering together and The Little Gym
[37:14] that we had here in in McKenzie Town and
[37:17] just a wonderful opportunity to get
[37:19] together and I'm sure that everybody saw
[37:21] the videos and everybody had fun it was
[37:23] just such a good time just to blow off a
[37:26] little bit of and just have some fun
[37:29] certainly thankful for the the word
[37:31] tonight and I know that whenever I get
[37:34] nervous like I feel right now that
[37:36] something's going to happen so if you go
[37:39] to Poland we'll just go to preaching and
[37:41] we'll see what the Lord will do
[37:43] certainly thankful to have the Livy
[37:44] family here together once again that the
[37:47] Lord would raise up brother Aiden the
[37:50] devil would come around and try and make
[37:52] him feel not well so not well that he
[37:55] can't come and fellowship ship in church
[37:57] but here he is God bless you brother
[38:00] Aiden it's a wonderful thing to have the
[38:04] have the life behind the name isn't
[38:06] it because that's the only thing that
[38:09] makes the demons tremble we can say
[38:11] Jesus Christ all we want but if the
[38:13] devil knows where we stand and we don't
[38:16] stand behind the word the devil's got
[38:19] every right to stand in our way and to
[38:22] throw as many traps and banana peels as
[38:24] he can and and we don't have any help
[38:27] but boy oh boy when we can actually get
[38:29] his life living out through us then you
[38:32] know what happens is we stop looking at
[38:33] the problems we stop looking at the
[38:36] problems in ourselves and we stop
[38:38] looking at the problems in other people
[38:40] and what we do is we start to focus on
[38:41] the word and the more that we focus on
[38:43] the word the less the problems seem to
[38:46] be the problems don't disappear we have
[38:48] as just as many problems it's just like
[38:51] as a believer of this word we do as many
[38:54] things that we want to do as any as
[38:57] often as we want to do it like brother
[38:59] bradam said you know I have I smoke as
[39:01] much as I want to I drink as much as I
[39:04] want to but as a Believer you don't want
[39:05] to do either one you don't want to smoke
[39:08] and you don't want to drink they're both
[39:10] outward expressions of the inward things
[39:13] that are going on in our lives and you
[39:16] know sometimes we can come to a place in
[39:17] our lives where we just want to skirt
[39:19] The Edge we want to go right to the very
[39:21] edge of the promised land we've said it
[39:22] this way before Remember When the
[39:24] Children of Israel were in their
[39:25] Promised Land they had a blessing that
[39:28] they couldn't be touched but if they got
[39:31] too close to the edge the enemies have
[39:34] Spears and arrows maybe they could stick
[39:36] them with a spear and get wounded don't
[39:39] go close to the edge we told the story a
[39:40] little while ago brother bradam was
[39:41] talking about a man who who said that he
[39:44] could drive his car right to the very
[39:46] edge of the road on the mountain and and
[39:47] there's a great Cliff there but he could
[39:49] ride it no problem along the edge why
[39:51] would you want to do that what if it
[39:53] gave way there would be nothing to save
[39:55] you you would just tumble down down the
[39:56] hill don't go to the edge drive right as
[39:58] close to the inside of the road as you
[40:01] can brothers and sisters don't don't
[40:02] worry about trying to do things that the
[40:04] world does this world's going to
[40:07] burn as Believers we don't want to get
[40:09] as close as we can to this world and you
[40:12] know we talked about it we'll probably
[40:13] continue to hammer on it there's gates
[40:15] of hell that are swinging and flapping
[40:17] in the breeze trying to get our
[40:19] attention the Gates of Hell will prevail
[40:22] if we don't stay behind the word but boy
[40:25] oh boy if we can actually identify those
[40:27] Gates of Hell what's a Gate of Hell you
[40:29] can do the research in your own life ask
[40:31] what we do in our lives bring it before
[40:34] the Lord in prayer and say Lord is this
[40:36] a Gate of Hell see what he tells us ask
[40:39] him and see if he won't tell us directly
[40:42] and he will he'll say yeah that is a
[40:45] Gate of Hell I don't want you to do that
[40:47] stay away from that put it down he'll
[40:50] tell us very
[40:51] clearly I know sorry sometimes I get a
[40:55] little excited
[40:57] but it's it's what it is brothers and
[40:59] sisters we're we're at a time where
[41:01] where nations are
[41:02] breaking and Israel's Awakening
[41:05] Hallelujah I heard something today and I
[41:07] don't even know if it's true and maybe I
[41:09] shouldn't say it but just just maybe for
[41:11] shock value for anyone that could be
[41:13] listening tonight I I heard it said that
[41:15] China is erasing Israel off of their
[41:19] Maps Israel isn't going to exist
[41:22] according to China so imagine all of
[41:25] those who
[41:26] in conglomeration in Alliance with China
[41:30] what they're talking about behind the
[41:32] scenes we know in the Book of Revelation
[41:34] it says that the whole world will gather
[41:37] around Israel around the camp of the
[41:39] Saints and you know many times we would
[41:42] say wow there's a whole bunch of
[41:43] different things that have to happen
[41:44] before that you know the Book of
[41:45] Revelation is not in chronological
[41:48] order we cannot say that the Book of
[41:50] Revelation chapter 1 has to happen
[41:52] chapter 2 has to happen 3 4 5 6 7 all
[41:56] the the way up to chapter 22 and when we
[41:57] see chapter 21 coming to pass then we
[42:00] know we need to get ready because it's
[42:01] the sign of the end brothers and sisters
[42:03] we can see things happening from
[42:05] Revelations chapter 20 right now today
[42:08] amen it's the way God does it don't
[42:11] don't look for signs and and wonders to
[42:13] draw us back because we're going to miss
[42:16] it when that time comes we need to know
[42:17] exactly where we stand today you know
[42:20] when the death angel was passing through
[42:22] the land of of of Egypt they were told
[42:25] to apply the token and how are they told
[42:27] to apply the token it was through the
[42:29] voice of a Vindicated Prophet Hallelujah
[42:32] take that voice don't take anyone else's
[42:35] opinion and apply that token put it on
[42:38] your home make sure that your children
[42:40] know where you stand make sure they know
[42:43] they're
[42:46] safe yes being a legalist ain't going to
[42:48] save you getting the token
[42:52] will dos and don'ts will put you in the
[42:55] grave yes but the life behind the name
[42:59] that will get you out of
[43:02] it you know talking about the exposition
[43:05] of the seven Church ages for those
[43:06] people who aren't aware of where we're
[43:08] at um we're studying this book and we're
[43:12] going to go right into detail with it
[43:13] we're just taking our time uh this is uh
[43:15] I think the fourth fourth service on
[43:18] this and uh just a little recap you know
[43:21] we read the the introduction and got
[43:25] into it this is a book that that William
[43:26] brandham the the prophet for our age he
[43:29] he put this together he penned it we
[43:30] read the introduction and then we read
[43:32] you know the beginning part of
[43:34] revelation of Jesus Christ and and it's
[43:36] based on the the the Book of Revelation
[43:39] chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3 it's
[43:42] it's the church ages the message of God
[43:45] through John the
[43:48] Revelator um John the Divine St John the
[43:51] Divine to the churches um he was uh put
[43:56] out by the churches they did not like
[43:58] him at all because he was a follower of
[44:00] Jesus and he was put on the aisle of
[44:02] patmas for his testimony of Jesus Christ
[44:05] and we know that the believer in in
[44:07] today's world will be persecuted for the
[44:09] testimony of Jesus Christ we're not
[44:11] going to be liked and and that's just
[44:13] the way it is and you know we uh read it
[44:16] on Sunday or or I I talked about it the
[44:19] the story of the Great American
[44:20] evangelist he he thought that he was
[44:23] doomed for judgment when he got before
[44:26] before that throne in his dream he went
[44:27] before the white Throne of judgment and
[44:29] he thought he was a good person till he
[44:31] got in that presence he said and he
[44:32] recognized even as an evangelist of the
[44:35] word of God that he was no good there
[44:37] was nothing good inside of him but there
[44:40] was a voice behind him that said I'll
[44:42] stand for him because he stood for me we
[44:45] need to make sure that we know where we
[44:47] stand brothers and sisters and it's not
[44:48] just behind a bunch of books and tapes
[44:50] and it's not behind an association that
[44:52] says my mom and my dad they went to
[44:54] message churches my whole life and and I
[44:56] live a good life and and I follow
[44:58] everything diligently that's not going
[44:59] to do it the only thing that's going to
[45:01] do it is the Holy Ghost token in your
[45:02] life in our lives that's the only thing
[45:05] that we can do but that only comes by
[45:08] the message of the hour in our day
[45:11] there's a lot of people claiming the
[45:13] Holy Ghost and the token but they're not
[45:15] willing to take all of the word that's
[45:18] what the prophet for our day said and
[45:19] that's totally what captivated me and I
[45:21] know it's what captivated you is when
[45:23] you heard him say if you can't take my
[45:25] word for it take the word of God right
[45:28] amen but we know the liberal theologians
[45:32] of our day they want to say well that
[45:35] was for a different Age and and that was
[45:37] for a different culture when you start
[45:39] talking about cutting women's hair and
[45:41] women wearing a garment that pertains to
[45:43] a man and you know we we've talked about
[45:45] it before but now that we're there I'm
[45:47] just going to say it again you know as
[45:49] as Believers of this word there's people
[45:51] that will say the word homosexuality is
[45:54] a is a very bad thing and and we would
[45:56] never condone that as Believers and and
[45:58] that would be the millions and billions
[46:00] of Christians that are out there and I
[46:01] know there's a whole bunch that say it's
[46:03] okay but we know those people who truly
[46:05] believe the word of God the word of God
[46:06] says that it's wrong for a man to lie
[46:08] with a man or a woman to lie with a
[46:10] woman that's wrong that's not right and
[46:13] we know that's what it is but that same
[46:15] word that says that it's an Abomination
[46:18] for that to happen the exact same word
[46:20] out of the strongs Strong's concordant
[46:23] says that it's an Abomination for a
[46:25] woman to wear a garment that pertains to
[46:26] a man that's right so how can a woman
[46:29] wear a pair of pants in a Christian
[46:31] Church that believes that homosexuality
[46:33] is wrong and think that it's okay how
[46:36] does that work how can you take the word
[46:38] of God and bend it to fit what you want
[46:40] it doesn't work that way and that's what
[46:42] the problem is today in the world and it
[46:45] was even in jesus' day you cannot take
[46:47] and and and and and manipulate the word
[46:50] of God to suit your needs and think that
[46:52] you're going to see the power of God
[46:54] manifest the way that you want it to
[46:56] the only way we're going to see it
[46:57] manifest the way we want it to and
[46:59] ultimately change our bodies is to take
[47:01] all the word and eat the book John was
[47:05] instructed to take the book and eat it
[47:07] up and it'll be sweet as honey in your
[47:10] mouth oh my when we talk about the word
[47:12] of God in church it's so beautiful and
[47:15] so sweet as honey but boy it makes our
[47:18] bellies bitter when it comes time to
[47:20] actually walk the walk instead of just
[47:22] talking the talk it becomes very
[47:25] difficult to do but you know brothers
[47:26] and sisters the more that we do walk the
[47:29] walk and not talk the more that we do
[47:32] actually just take this word and live it
[47:34] out Satan will begin to tremble he'll
[47:37] see that we are not just actors we are
[47:41] truly Sons and Daughters of God we're
[47:43] the manifestation of the attributes of
[47:46] the Lord Jesus Christ that he intended
[47:48] for this age from before the foundation
[47:50] of the world there's a whole bunch of
[47:53] people throughout all the ages where
[47:54] Satan wonders I wonder about that person
[47:57] why could that person that person went
[47:59] right to the Grave they're just a weirdo
[48:02] wonders why they would never change they
[48:04] would never Bend because they were a
[48:06] manifested attribute for that age and
[48:09] brothers and sisters we're no different
[48:11] today we are living Witnesses of the
[48:13] word of God for our day the
[48:16] manifestation of the attributes of God
[48:18] Almighty here on Earth my goodness you
[48:22] know just a little recap there's an
[48:23] amazing secret power available to the
[48:25] church if we can
[48:26] recognize the Antichrist spirit that
[48:29] crept into the framework of the church
[48:31] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[48:33] kind of like what we're talking about
[48:35] already talk in the talk but not walk in
[48:36] the walk if we can actually recognize
[48:38] that and I want to say this brothers and
[48:40] sisters I've always kind of thought that
[48:42] you know we got to look at brothers and
[48:43] we got to look at sisters and see if we
[48:45] can identify that that Antichrist spirit
[48:47] that makes the church lukewarm formal
[48:49] and Powerless can we look at another
[48:50] church somewhere maybe in Edmonton or or
[48:53] or somewhere else Vancouver or or or or
[48:56] anywhere else in the world can we start
[48:58] to identify this don't do that look at
[49:00] that Antichrist spirit that would try
[49:02] and enter this church right here and
[49:05] make it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[49:08] make it an inward search because if we
[49:10] can do that brothers and sisters then
[49:11] we're going to see the power of God
[49:13] manifest in our lives not because we
[49:15] want to see signs and wonders because we
[49:17] want to know that he's alive and well in
[49:20] here because Satan wants to come around
[49:23] and try and make us lukewarm formal and
[49:25] powerless try and make us cold and
[49:28] starchy and just say I've got it there's
[49:31] nothing more that I can do no no no no
[49:33] no not as Believers as Believers we want
[49:36] to shout we want to sing We want to
[49:38] dance we want to express the life that's
[49:41] inside of us to this world around us am
[49:45] you know brother Bram he says it in this
[49:46] book that we can never overemphasize the
[49:48] importance of Revelation to who to a
[49:51] True Believer when you have a True
[49:53] Believer someone that really believes
[49:55] this word really earnestly contends for
[49:57] the faith there's something inside of us
[50:00] that we can never ever ever ever
[50:02] overestimate the the or overemphasize
[50:05] the importance of Revelation because
[50:06] what is revelation Revelation is God
[50:08] speaking to us individually you don't
[50:11] need a Vicor of Christ to come and be
[50:13] the mediator in between you and God as
[50:16] soon as that happens brothers and
[50:17] sisters it's Catholic it's Universal it
[50:20] becomes denominational it's evil it's
[50:23] not the right thing the whole entire
[50:26] thing is about the Sons and Daughters of
[50:27] God having a relationship directly with
[50:29] God himself there is no other Prophet
[50:32] for this age there was only one prophet
[50:34] he came he executed his office he did
[50:37] his Priestly duties and God took him
[50:39] home now what does that mean to us do we
[50:42] look for
[50:44] another or do we actually know who he
[50:47] introduced do we recognize the
[50:49] introduction of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[50:51] the bride today we can never
[50:53] overemphasize the importance of
[50:55] Revelation so brothers and sisters I
[50:57] would say truly get Revelation more than
[51:00] anything get Revelation because when we
[51:02] get revelation God will speak to us
[51:05] directly that's how he speaks to us I
[51:08] don't know how many people have said it
[51:10] I know I've heard it said that there was
[51:11] a great teacher one time that said man
[51:13] can never hear the voice of God I don't
[51:16] know I would say God is God God can do
[51:19] whatever God wants to do if God wants us
[51:22] to hear an audible voice he'll do it
[51:25] that's right and and he could use a mule
[51:28] to do it through right it's
[51:31] God but I want to say this more often
[51:34] than not he's going to speak to our
[51:37] hearts it's going to be an inward voice
[51:40] and it's just going to be a little
[51:41] thought that happens right in there just
[51:43] just it just happens and it'll be
[51:45] anytime anywhere the least the times
[51:48] that we least expect it he'll speak to
[51:50] us brothers and sisters that is true
[51:52] Revelation and when that happens that's
[51:54] something that nobody body can ever take
[51:56] away from you we hear it said many times
[51:58] on this side of Eternity that it's
[51:59] important for us to get an education
[52:01] because when we have that status that
[52:04] that that that badge or that that plaque
[52:06] or or whatever that endorsement is
[52:08] nobody can ever take it away from us we
[52:10] can take the piece of paper and burn it
[52:11] and disappear but we would still know
[52:13] what it means to have a a finance degree
[52:16] or we would know what it means to be an
[52:17] engineer we would have all of that
[52:19] learning inside of us and nobody could
[52:21] ever take it away how much more as a son
[52:23] and daughter of God eat the book
[52:24] brothers and sisters get the Revelation
[52:26] by the spirit for the words in the book
[52:29] and nobody can ever take it away from us
[52:31] why could they never take it away from
[52:33] us because no human being ever gave it
[52:34] to us we talked about Simon bar Jonah
[52:37] having a name change and how Jesus said
[52:39] to him Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood
[52:41] hath not revealed that to you but my
[52:43] Father which is in heaven he hath
[52:44] revealed that unto you it's no different
[52:46] for the Bride of Jesus Christ today we
[52:48] have got to get that same Revelation
[52:50] today and when we do it will change our
[52:53] bodies and you know you want to see if
[52:54] you're to actually go in the in the
[52:56] Rapture I'll say it this way we will see
[52:59] a change in our bodies the smoking will
[53:01] disappear the drinking will disappear
[53:03] the pornography will disappear all of
[53:05] our bad habits will disappear all of the
[53:08] the old nature will begin to disappear
[53:10] we'll become a new creature in Christ
[53:11] Jesus that body change starts right here
[53:14] this flesh will never ever inherit the
[53:17] Kingdom of Heaven don't think it will
[53:20] because even though we're delivered of
[53:21] all of those things we just talked about
[53:23] and more all the other things that can
[53:25] happen in this life when we actually are
[53:28] delivered of those things Satan comes
[53:29] back around and says but didn't you like
[53:31] this before and oh what about that don't
[53:33] you remember you used to have a bad
[53:35] temper you used to do this you used to
[53:37] look at that you used to say the other
[53:40] didn't you enjoy that music oh that
[53:42] music oh that music I'm talking from
[53:45] experience brothers and sisters that
[53:47] music it's just got that beat and it
[53:49] just does something it just oh my that's
[53:52] the devil we just got to remind them get
[53:55] lost you're an offense to me because
[53:57] it's not me it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:59] in me amen you've got no place here
[54:02] devil your place is under my feet until
[54:04] the day you get thrown into the Lake of
[54:07] Fire and that day is coming amen but
[54:09] it's only through Revelation that his by
[54:12] his spirit that we can understand this
[54:13] scripture and some might say well it's
[54:15] only this book He's only talking about
[54:17] this book I'll say that he's talking
[54:18] about all scripture we're only going to
[54:21] understand the book this book by
[54:23] Revelation that's the only way we're
[54:25] going to be able to read it properly
[54:27] we're going to be able to see it and
[54:29] understand it so you know what get the
[54:31] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you'll
[54:32] live the life of Christ you'll have his
[54:34] nature and don't look at your problems
[54:36] don't look at the problems I'll say the
[54:38] problems forgive me I said your problems
[54:40] they're not your problems they're the
[54:42] devil's problems amen don't look at the
[54:44] problems make them his
[54:47] problems don't look at them just look at
[54:50] the promise keep your eyes on the
[54:53] promise so long as we can keep our our
[54:55] eyes on the promise we will see the word
[54:58] come to manifest in our
[55:00] lives but how are we going to do that
[55:04] just just simple Keys brothers and
[55:05] sisters and I know we all know it but I
[55:07] just we need to say it maybe maybe for
[55:10] someone I don't know this is stuff that
[55:12] I was thinking about today and yesterday
[55:14] and the day before the only way we're
[55:16] going to have overcoming power in our
[55:17] lives is to feed the spirit of God he is
[55:20] a living being he's a living life how
[55:23] many of us will just allow ourselves to
[55:26] starve a and not eat and then when we do
[55:29] eat we'll just go and open up a garbage
[55:31] can I remember hearing this preach to me
[55:33] years ago we'll just go and say you know
[55:35] I'm so hungry I'm going to break my fast
[55:37] and I'm just going to go and find the
[55:38] stinkiest garbage can that I can find
[55:40] and I'm going to open it up and I'm just
[55:42] going to go through it and just start
[55:44] eating the garbage that smelly steamy
[55:47] hot trash I'm GNA just start feeding
[55:49] upon that while I'm super hungry who
[55:52] would do
[55:53] that but brother grantom says we'll take
[55:56] and we'll poke anything down and he's
[55:58] talking specifically about the religious
[56:00] stuff we got to be careful with the
[56:02] religious stuff but brothers and sisters
[56:05] don't go and and get into
[56:07] trash if we get into trash then what
[56:09] we're going to do is just put ourselves
[56:11] to the back of the line spirit of God we
[56:13] can already have it but he's just going
[56:15] to go and set up in the tree and just
[56:17] sit there and wait and think when are
[56:19] you going to start feeding me right the
[56:22] spirit of God only feeds on one thing
[56:24] brothers and sisters it's this right
[56:26] here it's this right here if we start
[56:29] taking worldly pleasures thinking that
[56:31] it's going to be okay it's going to be
[56:32] just fine we'll be able to do this and
[56:34] we can handle that can you I'll say this
[56:38] maybe you can in your flesh because this
[56:40] flesh is super resilient but he can't
[56:42] amen nor will he he will not so if we
[56:46] want to see him live out through us
[56:47] we've got to make sure that we keep this
[56:49] Temple holy this Temple is the Temple of
[56:52] the Holy Ghost right we need to remember
[56:55] that this is the temple that we're
[56:56] talking about
[56:58] yes got to feed only on the word amen
[57:01] you know when we get sick sometimes we
[57:04] can we can only want the medicine and I
[57:06] know that I've been really sick at times
[57:08] and and I would have given anything for
[57:10] medication for something from the doctor
[57:12] to make me better and you know it uh I
[57:16] would have done just about anything like
[57:17] I said and you know many times
[57:19] spiritually we can become ill but are we
[57:22] willing to actually take the medicine
[57:24] and the medicine is the word there's a
[57:26] remedy brothers and sisters when we're
[57:28] dealing with an illness spiritually
[57:30] speaking but what we just got to take
[57:31] take the medicine take the medication
[57:33] get it
[57:34] down you know it's the word the whole
[57:37] word and nothing but the word that's the
[57:38] only thing that's going to work for us
[57:40] we're in a world where they're willing
[57:41] to take anything but the word amen
[57:44] anything but the word and you know in
[57:48] the words of Benjamin
[57:50] Franklin I I just thought it was so good
[57:52] an ounce of prevention brothers and
[57:53] sisters just a few minutes in prayer
[57:57] just
[57:58] one quarter of a scripture three words
[58:02] from a verse in the Bible and a few
[58:04] minutes in prayer an ounce of prevention
[58:07] is worth a pound of cure that's right if
[58:10] we take the time to give the Holy Ghost
[58:13] life in our lives he's waiting for us to
[58:15] feed him and when we do it brothers and
[58:17] sisters something Supernatural takes
[58:19] place and our prayers for today are are
[58:21] what affects us tomorrow Hallelujah we
[58:23] can't expect tomorrow that when we're
[58:25] driving to have the protection that we
[58:27] need because we haven't prayed I mean
[58:30] God is is rich in Mercy isn't he for the
[58:33] times that we do fail and we don't
[58:35] actually spend the time in prayer we
[58:37] don't feed on the word of God but yet he
[58:39] still protects us what a God we serve
[58:43] What a Mighty God oh he's so wonderful
[58:46] tonight I just want to get into reading
[58:48] here that's enough recap I could go on
[58:50] and on and on I could I think I could
[58:51] just preach continually over you know
[58:54] what we talk talked about you know last
[58:56] service but uh we need to carry on I
[58:58] know we do so I'm just going to start
[59:01] with uh paragraph 8 in uh chapter
[59:07] 1 introduction to chapter one paragraph
[59:10] 8 of the church age
[59:13] book and by the way if anybody wants one
[59:16] we have some let me know I know uh
[59:19] there's been a couple of requests
[59:21] brother Bram says now I said This Book
[59:23] of Revelation as a revelation of Jesus
[59:25] and what he's doing in the churches for
[59:27] those Seven
[59:29] Ages it is a revelation because the
[59:31] disciples themselves didn't know these
[59:33] recorded truths it had not been
[59:35] previously revealed to them you remember
[59:37] that they came to Jesus in the book of
[59:39] Acts and asked him are you at this time
[59:42] going to restore the kingdom to Israel
[59:46] and he said it's not for you to know the
[59:48] times or the seasons those men were
[59:50] still thinking of Jesus having an
[59:52] Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual
[59:54] ual Kingdom that he was going to
[59:57] build even he could not tell them about
[1:00:00] his place in it for the father had not
[1:00:04] revealed it unto him but now after his
[1:00:07] death and resurrection and at this
[1:00:09] particular time in his mediatorial
[1:00:13] ministry he is able to set forth here in
[1:00:16] this revelation of himself to John what
[1:00:19] his glory and presence in the church
[1:00:22] would mean and do
[1:00:25] in this Revelation he tells us what the
[1:00:27] end of the devil
[1:00:29] is he tells how he's going to deal with
[1:00:32] the devil and cast him into a lake of
[1:00:35] fire the Lake of Fire his Lake of Fire
[1:00:39] he reveals the end of the wicked ones
[1:00:41] who follow Satan and Satan hates
[1:00:44] that have you ever noticed how Satan
[1:00:46] hates two books of the Bible more than
[1:00:48] all others through liberal theologians
[1:00:53] and pseudo scientists s he is always
[1:00:56] attacking the Book of Genesis and the
[1:00:58] Book of Revelation in both of these
[1:01:00] books we find Satan's origin his awful
[1:01:04] ways and his destruction that's why he
[1:01:07] attacks them he hates to be exposed and
[1:01:10] in those books he is exposed for exactly
[1:01:13] what he is isn't that
[1:01:16] beautiful he can't hide he wants to hide
[1:01:19] but he can't
[1:01:20] hide Jesus said about Satan he has no
[1:01:24] part in me and I have no part in him the
[1:01:26] devil would like to prove that different
[1:01:28] but he cannot so he does all he can this
[1:01:32] is so critically important here brothers
[1:01:35] and sisters he does all he can to
[1:01:38] destroy confidence in the word yes
[1:01:42] that's right what's one of the easiest
[1:01:44] ways for him to destroy confidence in
[1:01:47] the word and that's to get people
[1:01:50] looking at
[1:01:52] people get people looking at others
[1:01:54] yeah get people looking at brother Barry
[1:01:57] brother Barry says don't look at brother
[1:01:58] Barry Barry says look at Lord Jesus
[1:02:01] Christ brother Barry will disappoint you
[1:02:04] we talked about it on Sunday and I want
[1:02:06] to take it a step further don't look at
[1:02:09] yourselves don't look at ourselves
[1:02:11] brothers and
[1:02:12] sisters take the confidence in the word
[1:02:14] and put it back in the word the word
[1:02:16] says that you're an overcomer the
[1:02:18] greater is he that is in
[1:02:20] who than he that is in this world and
[1:02:24] the that's in this world is is how many
[1:02:26] thousands times thousands of devils that
[1:02:29] poured out of Hollywood out of the the
[1:02:32] pit of Hell the the place where the lid
[1:02:34] was taken off and they're after you
[1:02:37] they're after me they're after our
[1:02:39] children but greater is he that is in US
[1:02:42] brothers and sisters than he that's in
[1:02:43] the world you're now already seated in
[1:02:45] Heavenly places you're more than a
[1:02:46] conqueror through Christ Jesus through
[1:02:48] this word that's in you Satan he hates
[1:02:51] this but we love it Jesus said that
[1:02:54] about this about said Jesus said about
[1:02:57] Satan he has no part in me I have no
[1:02:58] part in him the devil would like to
[1:03:00] prove that different but he cannot so he
[1:03:02] does all he can to destroy confidence in
[1:03:04] the word but when the church disbelieves
[1:03:07] Satan and believes the spirit's
[1:03:11] revelation of the word the Gates of Hell
[1:03:14] cannot Prevail against her I believe
[1:03:16] this is where we were leaving off last
[1:03:18] week and I want to tell you brothers and
[1:03:20] sisters those gates are swinging there
[1:03:22] is a nasty storm Brewing but you know
[1:03:25] what nothing is going to stop God's word
[1:03:27] from coming to pass in your and my life
[1:03:30] amen if he wants us to continue on as a
[1:03:33] body of Believers here in Calgary
[1:03:34] marching forward then nothing is going
[1:03:36] to stop it from happening right amen if
[1:03:39] he wants us to go in the Rapture the
[1:03:41] general resurrection and Rapture then
[1:03:43] nothing is going to stop it from
[1:03:44] happening doesn't matter what we see in
[1:03:46] our lives today doesn't matter what we
[1:03:48] see in our lives yesterday it doesn't
[1:03:50] matter what we can think about for our
[1:03:52] lives tomorrow all we need to do is
[1:03:54] humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:03:56] Lord and He will lift us
[1:03:59] up paragraph 14 he says let me just put
[1:04:01] in a word here from my own Ministry if
[1:04:03] you don't mind you all know this gift in
[1:04:05] my life is Supernatural it's a gift
[1:04:07] whereby the holy spirit is able to
[1:04:08] discern diseases the thoughts of men's
[1:04:10] hearts and other hidden things that only
[1:04:12] God could know and then reveal to me I
[1:04:14] wish you could stand with me and see the
[1:04:16] faces of people when Satan knows he's
[1:04:18] going to be exposed now it isn't the
[1:04:20] people that I'm talking about it is that
[1:04:23] Satan has got hold in their lives
[1:04:26] through sin indifference and disease but
[1:04:30] you should see their faces Satan knows
[1:04:33] he's going to be exposed and the most
[1:04:35] peculiar changes come over the people's
[1:04:37] countenances Satan is afraid he knows
[1:04:41] that the spirit of God is about to let
[1:04:42] people know of his works that is why he
[1:04:46] hates these meetings so much when names
[1:04:48] are called and diseases revealed Satan
[1:04:52] hates
[1:04:53] it just want to point this out brothers
[1:04:55] and sisters Satan has got a hold in
[1:04:57] their lives this is his Avenues through
[1:05:01] sin which is unbelief indifference which
[1:05:04] is just saying me you know what
[1:05:06] nothing's going to change me I I've
[1:05:08] heard it all before I I know I I I got
[1:05:10] saved you know 100 years ago and I'm
[1:05:13] saved and nothing is ever going to move
[1:05:15] me it's all the same indifference and
[1:05:18] disease sometimes we get a sickness in
[1:05:19] our lives we get an illness God will
[1:05:22] allow us to have illnesses so that we'll
[1:05:23] say hey you know what I got to go on my
[1:05:26] back so I can look up you know if we can
[1:05:29] just actually do that ourselves just go
[1:05:31] on our knees and look up God will
[1:05:33] actually look after us he will prevent
[1:05:36] all three of those things from having
[1:05:38] the ability to do it in our lives
[1:05:40] paragraph 15 now what is this it's not
[1:05:42] mind reading it's not telepathy nor is
[1:05:45] it witchcraft it is a revelation by the
[1:05:47] holy ghost that is the only way I can
[1:05:50] know it of course the carnal mind will
[1:05:52] call it anything but the Holy Ghost we
[1:05:54] talked about this before when the word
[1:05:56] is coming forward when a minister is
[1:05:57] preaching people will say wow how does
[1:05:59] he know that why is he talking about
[1:06:01] that maybe someone's told him about my
[1:06:03] thoughts he nobody's told him about your
[1:06:05] thoughts the Holy Ghost is actually just
[1:06:06] speaking through him and he's speaking
[1:06:08] directly to you he's actually
[1:06:10] ministering by Revelation the through
[1:06:12] the Spirit by Revelation to you
[1:06:14] otherwise why do you come to church if
[1:06:17] you don't come to church to get re
[1:06:19] Revelation by the spirit brothers and
[1:06:21] sisters you're missing the point
[1:06:27] goes on to say let me show you another
[1:06:29] reason why Satan hates This Book of
[1:06:31] Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:06:34] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:06:37] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:06:40] changes not he knows that he's talking
[1:06:43] about Satan here Satan knows that a lot
[1:06:47] more than do 90% of the
[1:06:51] theologians he knows that since God God
[1:06:54] is immutable in his nature then he is
[1:06:56] just as immutable in his ways thus Satan
[1:07:01] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:07:03] at Pentecost with the power of God Mark
[1:07:06] 16 in action is the true church that
[1:07:09] Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:07:12] false it has to
[1:07:14] be now remember this Christ in the true
[1:07:17] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:07:19] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:07:21] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:07:23] come into the church church and defile
[1:07:25] it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:07:29] Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:07:32] Works attempted destruction of God's
[1:07:34] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:07:37] word right down to the time he is cast
[1:07:40] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:07:43] cannot stand it isn't that
[1:07:46] beautiful he is a formidable adversary
[1:07:50] he is created to fight his cause right
[1:07:53] to to the death amen but you know what
[1:07:56] we don't have to fight our cause to the
[1:07:58] death brothers and sisters the only
[1:08:00] thing we have to do is die to ourselves
[1:08:03] he's already fought it to the death he's
[1:08:05] already taken all of our sin to the
[1:08:08] death to the Cross to the Grave to hell
[1:08:11] and handed all of our sins directly to
[1:08:14] Satan and said you know what this group
[1:08:16] of people they're
[1:08:18] Justified I have taken all of their
[1:08:21] shame all of their sin and I put it
[1:08:23] right back on you Satan and Satan knows
[1:08:25] it he knows assuredly that that's what's
[1:08:27] happened and it's up to us to recognize
[1:08:29] that when we recognize that Satan will
[1:08:31] become powerless before
[1:08:34] us it exposes Satan reveals revealing
[1:08:38] his Works attempted destruction of God's
[1:08:40] people that's what he wants to do is
[1:08:42] destroy God's people he thinks that he
[1:08:44] can do that he wants to destroy God's
[1:08:46] people and what the discrediting of
[1:08:48] God's word he wants to say that the way
[1:08:51] that Ephesians 4 says that you should
[1:08:53] have have a five-fold Ministry and you
[1:08:55] should gather together in the name of
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ even more so as you see
[1:08:58] that day approaching you know what maybe
[1:09:01] it's not that way maybe there's another
[1:09:03] way maybe you could actually just do
[1:09:04] something else or or go somewhere else
[1:09:06] or think something else you can do it
[1:09:08] just a little bit differently you can
[1:09:10] still take the whole message of the hour
[1:09:11] but just apply it the way that you think
[1:09:14] it suits and sometimes other people will
[1:09:16] say hey you know what that's what we do
[1:09:19] and then you've got a group of people
[1:09:20] that do it all together if it's not
[1:09:22] according to the word of God it's wrong
[1:09:24] amen doesn't matter what it is if you
[1:09:27] want to know whether it's right take it
[1:09:29] back to the word of God Amen and I'll
[1:09:31] tell you where I'm coming at from this I
[1:09:32] had a guy sent me a text message he's
[1:09:34] been texting me and I don't know the
[1:09:37] brother at all I'll say he's a brother
[1:09:39] but he's texting me and it's almost I
[1:09:42] don't know what to say maybe I shouldn't
[1:09:43] even be saying it but he's asking me
[1:09:45] what I feel about tape
[1:09:47] Ministry I say listen to the message of
[1:09:50] the hour and get Revelation by the
[1:09:52] spirit and see what he tells you about
[1:09:54] tap ministry right don't ask
[1:10:01] me we need to see what he wants to know
[1:10:03] about it ask him what he wants done with
[1:10:06] the word of God in our day and when he
[1:10:09] tells you take the
[1:10:15] answer per Adventure that brother's
[1:10:17] listening to
[1:10:19] me you know tonight I just want to take
[1:10:21] and focus in on paragraph
[1:10:24] 16 and
[1:10:26] uh just a little bit that I believe the
[1:10:29] Lord spoke to me about here we've got
[1:10:31] half an hour and I'll try not to keep us
[1:10:32] late here because we got many many miles
[1:10:35] to cover and we're just going to we're
[1:10:37] going to be the tortoise in the race
[1:10:39] we're just gonna take real small steps
[1:10:42] and uh we're going to finish just as far
[1:10:44] as the the Lord wants us to he'll take
[1:10:46] us paragraph 16 says let me show you
[1:10:49] another reason why Satan hates This Book
[1:10:51] of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:10:52] church he knows that the Jes that Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:10:58] forever and that he changes not and and
[1:11:01] what I want to get to you tonight
[1:11:02] brothers and sisters is this next
[1:11:04] sentence it it is Jesus Christ the same
[1:11:07] yesterday today and forever it's Hebrews
[1:11:10] 138 and if you wouldn't mind just turn
[1:11:12] there with me in your Bibles we'll get
[1:11:15] there I'm going to continue on he
[1:11:17] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:11:21] more than do 90% of the theologians most
[1:11:24] people who study their way into
[1:11:27] Christianity they'll always always
[1:11:30] they'll be ever looking for the truth
[1:11:33] they'll always be studying ever learning
[1:11:36] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:11:38] of the truth know all the quotes know
[1:11:40] all the scriptures been to all the
[1:11:41] places have many many friends all around
[1:11:44] the world but still continually
[1:11:46] contending for something contesting for
[1:11:49] something striving for something never
[1:11:51] able to just have rest and and have
[1:11:53] peace because that's what Paul said hey
[1:11:56] didn't he say that that we should be
[1:11:58] content with what we've got and you know
[1:12:01] it's not always about wealth it's not
[1:12:03] always about saying these are the
[1:12:04] clothes that I've got maybe it's the
[1:12:06] church we're in maybe it's the house we
[1:12:08] live in maybe it's the position that
[1:12:11] we're in in the world maybe we don't
[1:12:13] even have a church to go to how can that
[1:12:15] be correct sometimes God will put us in
[1:12:17] a place so that we can actually shine
[1:12:19] his light to someone that would never
[1:12:22] hear about the word of God am but you
[1:12:25] know we'll always come subject to the
[1:12:26] word always he says he knows that a
[1:12:30] whole lot he knows that a whole lot more
[1:12:33] than do 90% of the
[1:12:36] theologians he knows speaking about
[1:12:38] Satan Satan knows that since God is
[1:12:42] immutable in his nature then he is just
[1:12:45] as immutable in his
[1:12:49] ways that sentence right there brothers
[1:12:51] and sisters is really where we're gonna
[1:12:53] start to preach from tonight what does
[1:12:56] the word immutable mean I I just know
[1:12:59] there's some people that maybe don't
[1:13:00] know the meaning of it and and I want to
[1:13:02] take a little bit of time and just talk
[1:13:03] about those those words in that sentence
[1:13:06] because Satan knows something that maybe
[1:13:09] sometimes we don't know or we just don't
[1:13:11] really consciously think about but the
[1:13:13] prophet of God put this in this book God
[1:13:15] put this in this book through the
[1:13:17] prophet for a reason he's saying these
[1:13:19] words to us that that Satan knows that
[1:13:23] God is that way but I want to say
[1:13:24] tonight brothers and sisters do we know
[1:13:27] that God is that way because sometimes
[1:13:29] we act like he's not sometimes I act
[1:13:32] like he's not like there's something
[1:13:34] that I need to do something that I
[1:13:36] haven't done or something that I should
[1:13:38] do when really we're not talking about
[1:13:41] running a a sprinting race and sometimes
[1:13:43] it can feel that way we get inspiration
[1:13:45] of God and we just want to we want to
[1:13:47] shout it from the from the mountaintops
[1:13:50] and and we want to do all that we can
[1:13:52] for the kingdom of God and the message
[1:13:53] of the hour and then you know what
[1:13:55] happens Monday rolls around and we're
[1:13:58] exhausted Tuesday rolls around and we're
[1:14:00] exhausted and sometimes we'll get enough
[1:14:02] energy to come to church on a Wednesday
[1:14:04] and then we're a little bit excited and
[1:14:06] maybe we go through the rest of the week
[1:14:08] and it's just exhausting and it's tiring
[1:14:10] and it's hard and sometimes that's the
[1:14:12] way our lives are but you know what I
[1:14:14] think the spirit of God doesn't want to
[1:14:16] see us go like this and like this and I
[1:14:18] know we live in The Human Condition I
[1:14:19] think the spirit of God wants to see us
[1:14:21] just do this brothers and sisters just
[1:14:23] continually go higher and higher and
[1:14:25] higher and not be looking down on people
[1:14:28] even though you come to a place where
[1:14:30] you're not looking down but you're
[1:14:31] saying why is it that people don't
[1:14:34] actually see this why why don't why why
[1:14:36] are they struggling with certain things
[1:14:38] in their lives why are people doing that
[1:14:40] it's because we're in a one room
[1:14:41] Schoolhouse and we're all on our own
[1:14:43] Journeys we don't ever want to talk bad
[1:14:46] about people or look down on people we
[1:14:48] want to encourage people brother Bram
[1:14:50] says when someone's in the ditch you
[1:14:52] pull them out you don't push him further
[1:14:54] in but Satan knows that God is immutable
[1:14:58] in his nature the word immutable it
[1:15:00] means unchanging over time or unable to
[1:15:04] be
[1:15:05] changed he's
[1:15:08] immutable he's not changeable H humans
[1:15:11] are changeable aren't we changeable we
[1:15:14] have so many ways that we can be changed
[1:15:16] in so many different things that can
[1:15:18] happen but here brother bradam says he
[1:15:20] knows that since God is immutable in
[1:15:23] nature what's his nature we know that
[1:15:25] he's immutable unchanging over time or
[1:15:28] unable to be changed in what in his
[1:15:30] nature the basic or inherent features of
[1:15:33] something especially when seen as
[1:15:36] characteristic of it his
[1:15:39] word his word is the only thing that we
[1:15:42] have to judge him by we're not going to
[1:15:45] say that I want to take a person's
[1:15:47] account for him and say that that that's
[1:15:50] the only life that he lives we want to
[1:15:52] take his word that's the only thing that
[1:15:53] he wants we know that a lot of people
[1:15:55] claim the name of Jesus Christ they even
[1:15:57] claim the blood of Jesus Christ but when
[1:16:00] you take the word of Jesus Christ the
[1:16:02] words of Jesus Christ is a different
[1:16:05] story so we have immutable unchanging
[1:16:09] over time or unable to be changed in
[1:16:11] nature the basic inherent or inherent
[1:16:13] features of something especially when
[1:16:15] seen as characteristic of it
[1:16:18] immutable
[1:16:21] immutable I want to take and and look at
[1:16:23] another quote here uh I believe no this
[1:16:28] is the one sorry I'm just going to read
[1:16:29] it again he knows that since God is as
[1:16:32] immutable in his nature then he is just
[1:16:34] as immutable in his ways thus Satan
[1:16:35] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:16:38] at Pentecost with the power of God Mark
[1:16:41] 16 and action is the true church that
[1:16:43] Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:16:45] false it has to be and I think we can
[1:16:48] look at that and read it from
[1:16:49] potentially a a Catholic or a maybe a
[1:16:52] theological standpoint where we would
[1:16:54] say that yeah the original church at
[1:16:56] Pentecost that was the the 120 in the
[1:16:58] upper room and and they had the the
[1:17:01] cloven tongues of fire came down upon
[1:17:03] their heads and into the room like a
[1:17:04] rushing Mighty Wind and and they lost
[1:17:07] all their fear first first they were
[1:17:08] hiding in Jerusalem but then suddenly
[1:17:10] they were fearless and they went out
[1:17:11] into the streets and they were talking
[1:17:13] in different tongues and all the people
[1:17:15] around said how is it that they're
[1:17:17] speaking to us in our own language in
[1:17:19] our own tongues you know that's exactly
[1:17:21] what he's talking about but there's also
[1:17:23] the compound meaning and Revelation to
[1:17:25] it and you know we're talking about that
[1:17:28] that compound meaning and Revelation for
[1:17:30] us in our lives too Satan knows
[1:17:33] assuredly that the original church at
[1:17:34] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:17:37] and action this is where we left off
[1:17:39] last week reading Mark 16 and action
[1:17:41] there's things that the Church of God
[1:17:43] will be able to do you know God's not
[1:17:45] going to clown for nobody we're not
[1:17:47] going to go and drink poison we're not
[1:17:48] going to handle snakes we're not going
[1:17:49] to do all that stuff just to try and
[1:17:51] prove God we're going to take the word
[1:17:52] and put the word out there first and say
[1:17:54] that's what I believe this is what I
[1:17:57] believe I'm going to handle this word of
[1:17:59] God and see if the Devils don't tremble
[1:18:01] because I'm not just going to shake the
[1:18:02] word of God I'm going to eat the word of
[1:18:04] God and I'm going to become the word of
[1:18:06] God and Satan will know assuredly that
[1:18:09] this Temple has not become lukewarm
[1:18:11] formal and Powerless
[1:18:13] amen because it's truly Mark 16 in
[1:18:16] action in my life because you know
[1:18:18] brothers and sisters we all have to have
[1:18:20] a testimony doesn't matter whether we
[1:18:22] come from a a message home and we've
[1:18:24] never had any issues in our lives God is
[1:18:26] GNA see fit for us to go through trials
[1:18:29] trials are what's going to bring out
[1:18:32] whoever's living inside of us and if
[1:18:34] it's the devil that's hiding in there
[1:18:36] God's going to bring a trial to squish
[1:18:38] that devil out of you if you're a son
[1:18:40] and daughter of God and you know what we
[1:18:43] know that the word of God says that the
[1:18:44] trials of our faith are worth more
[1:18:47] they're more precious to a True Believer
[1:18:50] than any amount of riches in this world
[1:18:52] and you know it's not the trials of of
[1:18:54] my job and it's not the trials of my
[1:18:56] finances my my financial portfolio it's
[1:18:59] not the trials of any different thing
[1:19:00] that we could have in this life other
[1:19:02] than our faith Satan wants to get our
[1:19:05] faith in the word he wants to discredit
[1:19:07] the word of God in our lives but when we
[1:19:10] can esteem this word to be the greatest
[1:19:12] thing in our lives when we get Satan
[1:19:14] coming around we can say hey satan come
[1:19:16] here come here Satan I want to show you
[1:19:17] you see that lentil right there up above
[1:19:20] that door that lentil has the token and
[1:19:22] you see the post beside it right there
[1:19:25] and right there that blood was applied
[1:19:27] and I apply it again now in the name of
[1:19:29] Jesus Christ and you've got no power
[1:19:31] over me there's nothing that you can say
[1:19:33] or do to change my my ability to have
[1:19:36] credibility in the word of God I might
[1:19:38] not understand the situation I might not
[1:19:40] understand the circumstances I might not
[1:19:42] even understand the brother or the
[1:19:43] sister but I believe the word of God and
[1:19:45] I believe he is more powerful than any
[1:19:48] circumstance that I could see with my
[1:19:49] natural
[1:19:51] eye you know you know talking about this
[1:19:55] this this this sentence Satan knows that
[1:19:59] that he is as immutable in his nature
[1:20:02] that he is in his ways and the word way
[1:20:06] is a method style or manner of doing
[1:20:09] something there are two ways of
[1:20:11] approaching this problem similar method
[1:20:13] course or action a Road Track path or
[1:20:17] Street for traveling along his way Satan
[1:20:21] knows that God he he performs the same
[1:20:24] way throughout all of the years
[1:20:26] throughout all of the ages all of the
[1:20:28] church ages but Satan comes around and
[1:20:30] tries to actually get people to think
[1:20:32] that there's no credit to the word of
[1:20:33] God that that like we said last time
[1:20:36] that maybe the cloud was something wrong
[1:20:38] something was a miss and some people are
[1:20:40] Fanatics to think that there was a
[1:20:41] picture taken of a pillar of fire and
[1:20:43] maybe they had some sort of sort of sort
[1:20:45] of uh uh I don't know what you want to
[1:20:47] call he's already said that it's not
[1:20:48] witchcraft or or whatever but when the
[1:20:51] prophet of God stood on on the stage and
[1:20:53] said he's here now and I can see what is
[1:20:56] going on in people's lives I can discern
[1:20:58] diseases it wasn't him that was doing it
[1:21:01] it was that Pillar of Fire the same
[1:21:02] Pillar of Fire that came down on those
[1:21:04] 120 people in the upper room back on the
[1:21:07] day of Pentecost he was actually showing
[1:21:10] that this was the same Pillar of Fire
[1:21:12] the same one that came and revealed
[1:21:15] himself to the people back in the day in
[1:21:17] biblical days but Satan knows that God
[1:21:20] doesn't change yes amen and I just want
[1:21:23] to underline that tonight Satan knows
[1:21:26] that God can't change brothers and
[1:21:28] sisters I want to encourage every one of
[1:21:30] us tonight that God can't change he's
[1:21:33] not dead brothers and sisters he's very
[1:21:36] very much alive he is more alive than
[1:21:38] Satan is Satan is doomed Satan is on his
[1:21:41] path he's on the highway to hell we are
[1:21:44] not he even sang the song about it but
[1:21:48] you know I want to point this out
[1:21:50] tonight brothers and sisters I out of
[1:21:52] the Ephesian Church
[1:21:55] age if you were to type in the search I
[1:21:58] don't know if it will come up for you I
[1:21:59] didn't give you this tonight but the key
[1:22:01] given me the key given me out of the
[1:22:06] Ephesian Church age this is the Keystone
[1:22:09] out of the Bible brothers and sisters
[1:22:11] and this is why I think it's so
[1:22:12] important that that what we're talking
[1:22:14] about he's just as immutable in his
[1:22:16] nature as he is in his ways his nature
[1:22:19] his his his his his tender loving
[1:22:21] kindness he is a gentleman he doesn't
[1:22:24] want to slap us around that is a
[1:22:26] dogmatic human trait it's the devil that
[1:22:29] gets inside of men it's that Beast
[1:22:31] nature that wants to try and punish and
[1:22:34] make people feel bad God is a gentleman
[1:22:37] God wants to take us and lift us up and
[1:22:39] dust us off and bring love to our lives
[1:22:42] he wants to tell us that we're seated in
[1:22:43] Heavenly places that we're not doomed
[1:22:46] for Destruction but it's the devil that
[1:22:48] gets around that tries to make people
[1:22:50] feel bad but the Keystone revelation of
[1:22:53] the Bible is what I want to talk about
[1:22:55] brother Bram says it here the key given
[1:22:56] me of the Lord whereby I was able to
[1:22:59] determine the messenger for each age is
[1:23:02] a most scriptural one in fact it might
[1:23:05] be called the Keystone of the Bible if
[1:23:09] everybody anybody knows what a keystone
[1:23:11] is it's the central stone that you would
[1:23:13] take and and you would make everything
[1:23:15] supported by usually in an archway over
[1:23:18] top of a door you would put the Keystone
[1:23:20] in right in the middle and it would hold
[1:23:22] it would support that entire Arch all of
[1:23:25] the weight above it would press down
[1:23:27] upon that one stone in the middle the
[1:23:29] Keystone the key given me by the Lord
[1:23:33] whereby I was able to determine the
[1:23:35] messenger for each age is a most
[1:23:37] scriptural one can you imagine that it's
[1:23:39] not a most theological one it's not one
[1:23:42] that maybe an angel came and told me
[1:23:45] when I was in a cave it's not one that I
[1:23:47] found when I was sitting by a tree
[1:23:49] hunting squirrels it's a most scriptural
[1:23:51] one he takes it right back to the Bible
[1:23:54] right back to the word in fact it might
[1:23:56] be called the Keystone of the Bible it's
[1:23:58] the Revelation that God never changes
[1:24:01] and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[1:24:04] he is now this is white quite a ways
[1:24:08] ahead in the message the the exposition
[1:24:10] of the seven Church ages this is the
[1:24:11] Ephesian Church age the very first
[1:24:13] church age but he's saying the same
[1:24:15] thing that's right he's not changing it
[1:24:18] he's not taking and making it convenient
[1:24:20] for a little bit in the in the interest
[1:24:23] of of capturing people's attention he's
[1:24:25] saying the same thing and he just keeps
[1:24:27] underlining it that it's the word of God
[1:24:30] it's a scriptural answer is the
[1:24:32] Revelation that God never changes and
[1:24:34] that his ways are as unchangeable as he
[1:24:36] is in Hebrews 138 did we open that
[1:24:40] up I just got so excited I apologize
[1:24:43] let's read that Hebrews
[1:24:46] 138 a simple call it simple scripture
[1:24:50] maybe something that's really really
[1:24:52] spoken a lot and and we all know it so
[1:24:54] well but let's just read it tonight and
[1:24:57] and maybe let's just read it together
[1:24:59] let's speak it out loud because Satan
[1:25:01] knows these words and I think it's
[1:25:03] important for us to remind Satan that
[1:25:05] you know what he ain't the only one that
[1:25:07] knows these
[1:25:08] words the Revelation by the spirit to
[1:25:11] the True Believer can never be
[1:25:13] overemphasized brothers and sisters he
[1:25:15] isn't ever present help in our time of
[1:25:18] trouble in our time of need but Hebrews
[1:25:21] 138 it says Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:26] yesterday today and forever amen he's
[1:25:30] not going to be different tomorrow he's
[1:25:33] no different than he was yesterday and
[1:25:36] he is the same right now tonight in this
[1:25:38] service with us Brothers and
[1:25:41] Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:25:43] today and forever the Keystone of the
[1:25:45] Bible Ecclesiastes
[1:25:47] 3:14-15 I know that whatsoever God doeth
[1:25:51] it shall be forever amen has God done
[1:25:55] you amen brothers and sisters you're
[1:25:58] forever
[1:25:59] amen if God has done you you're forever
[1:26:03] you're an eternal being he can't lose a
[1:26:06] part of himself and he took you from his
[1:26:08] side and expressed you in this age
[1:26:11] you're a manifested attribute of the
[1:26:14] almighty God my
[1:26:16] goodness whatsoever God doeth it shall
[1:26:19] be forever nothing can be put to it
[1:26:22] nothing can be put to you nor anything
[1:26:24] be taken from it and God doeth it that
[1:26:28] men should fear before him that which
[1:26:31] hath been is now and that which is to be
[1:26:35] hath already been and God requireth that
[1:26:39] which is
[1:26:41] p the beginning the ending the past the
[1:26:44] present the future it's all God's it's
[1:26:47] all his he has seen it all he has done
[1:26:49] it all and he is it all brother bradam
[1:26:53] goes on to say here it is an unchanging
[1:26:55] God with unchanging ways what he did at
[1:26:58] the first he will have to keep on doing
[1:27:01] until it is done for the last time there
[1:27:04] will never be a
[1:27:08] change sometimes brother brandham says
[1:27:10] we can pray for things and we don't see
[1:27:13] it actually manifest the way that we
[1:27:14] pray it the way that we ask God we know
[1:27:17] that his word says if you have anything
[1:27:19] that you want just ask anything in my
[1:27:21] name and I'll give it to you as long as
[1:27:24] it's according to his will and not just
[1:27:26] according to his will but according to
[1:27:28] his will for your day according to his
[1:27:30] will for your season he's not just going
[1:27:33] to do exactly what we want every time we
[1:27:35] want it because we don't have the
[1:27:37] character to do that because we know
[1:27:39] that brother brandham said it that power
[1:27:41] without character is what it's satanic
[1:27:45] because we will want to do it upon the
[1:27:47] lust of Our Lives of our flesh of our
[1:27:49] spirit but you know as we pray tonight
[1:27:51] brothers and sisters we got to go beyond
[1:27:53] our flesh that's why we got to spend
[1:27:54] time in prayer we've got to go beyond
[1:27:56] our spirit we got to get through all of
[1:27:59] that that Humanity that's in the way of
[1:28:02] us and get that channel open from our
[1:28:04] soul to the Lord and when we go and
[1:28:07] stand before his throne in that state
[1:28:09] brothers and sisters on our knees having
[1:28:12] the right perspective when we talk about
[1:28:14] standing before his throne when we go
[1:28:15] there on that basis that's where he
[1:28:19] hears from us and that's where we hear
[1:28:21] back from him that's where we make
[1:28:23] contact with him and you know what
[1:28:26] sometimes the prayers that we pray will
[1:28:28] actually change when we get into that
[1:28:30] state because it's no longer us that are
[1:28:32] making the intercessions but it's his
[1:28:34] Spirit living out through us making
[1:28:36] groanings that we can't even
[1:28:39] comprehend right but then we'll see the
[1:28:42] Lord come on the scene then we'll see
[1:28:44] him actually take over that's when we
[1:28:47] see the hand of God move in our
[1:28:50] lives there will never be a change
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters he says apply that
[1:28:55] to the church
[1:28:56] ages when you read this for me it just
[1:28:59] unlocked it it's like wow it's such a
[1:29:02] dynamic Revelation that he is just the
[1:29:04] same yesterday today forever you know
[1:29:06] what then when you read this when you
[1:29:08] read the church ages you recognize that
[1:29:10] God has a pattern and he has a people
[1:29:13] that fit that pattern and those people
[1:29:16] they that fit the pattern you can tell
[1:29:18] whether they fit the pattern because you
[1:29:20] can give them the word test are they
[1:29:21] come up with a new Fantastic or are they
[1:29:23] taking whatever it is their teaching
[1:29:25] back to the word of God hallelujah if
[1:29:27] they're taking it back to the word of
[1:29:29] God then you got to say whoa hold on a
[1:29:31] second I need to take a look at this if
[1:29:34] you believe the word of God if you don't
[1:29:35] believe the word of God then there's
[1:29:36] really not much to talk about but if you
[1:29:38] are a son and daughter of God and you
[1:29:39] hear this for the first time you're
[1:29:41] going to say whoa what's going on what
[1:29:43] are you talking about what's all this
[1:29:44] noise about I I maybe don't understand
[1:29:47] all of it but something on the inside of
[1:29:49] the inside says my goodness tell tell me
[1:29:52] more yes amen he says apply that to the
[1:29:55] church ages the kind of excuse me the
[1:29:58] kind of a man God that God chose for the
[1:30:01] first age and how God manifested in that
[1:30:04] man's Ministry would be the example for
[1:30:06] all other ages what God did in the first
[1:30:11] church age is what he wants to do in all
[1:30:14] other agesen and we know the first
[1:30:17] church age start starts with Ephesus
[1:30:19] that was out of the Ephesian Church age
[1:30:21] and we get there um we got a little ways
[1:30:23] to go though and hopefully I can not
[1:30:26] talk too much it's quite a ways ahead
[1:30:29] but you know it's just a beautiful thing
[1:30:31] to to recognize that he has a pattern he
[1:30:34] has a way he is the same yesterday today
[1:30:36] forever he he is going to deal with us
[1:30:38] the way that he's always dealt with us
[1:30:40] as a gentleman we don't have to worry
[1:30:42] about getting slapped around by God it's
[1:30:43] the devil that wants to do that to us
[1:30:45] brothers and sisters so when we have
[1:30:47] that that feeling come over us of of
[1:30:50] pangs of fear that's a Spirit of bondage
[1:30:53] that's trying to get a hold of our lives
[1:30:55] and you know what it will cause us to do
[1:30:56] when we get too afraid is we'll start to
[1:30:58] actually become the the the words that
[1:31:01] we already read tonight and and and you
[1:31:04] know indifference is a big thing we can
[1:31:06] start to become indifferent about the
[1:31:08] word of God in our lives and about our
[1:31:10] situation we can say that our situation
[1:31:13] isn't going to change I got myself into
[1:31:14] this spot and I can't see a way out and
[1:31:17] you might not be able to see a way out
[1:31:18] but just look up brothers and sisters
[1:31:21] eat the book spend time in prayer feed
[1:31:24] that Holy Ghost life in your life don't
[1:31:27] go to a trash can and think that you're
[1:31:29] going to actually satisfy him that he's
[1:31:31] going to grow and and see him manifest
[1:31:33] in your life in a better way if you go
[1:31:35] to a garbage can you're going to put
[1:31:36] garbage in you're going to get garbage
[1:31:37] out but you know what good food makes
[1:31:40] good food isn't that the the saying good
[1:31:43] spiritual food brothers and sisters
[1:31:45] there's only one spiritual food by the
[1:31:47] way and it's the word of God am if we're
[1:31:50] spending time doing things that that
[1:31:51] don't gratify that don't edify that Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost In Our Lives don't think for a
[1:31:57] second that we're going to have
[1:31:58] overcoming power the devil's going to
[1:32:01] run rough shot over us and you know what
[1:32:03] he's a coward I want to remind us of
[1:32:05] this brothers and sisters he might not
[1:32:07] come and punch Us in the nose he might
[1:32:09] come and punch our kid in the nose
[1:32:12] that's the way the devil operates and
[1:32:14] you know what he's a coward but he's
[1:32:16] already defeated coward and he's running
[1:32:19] scared because he knows that we're
[1:32:20] moving into this revelation of who we
[1:32:22] are and when we catch that full
[1:32:24] revelation of what position we're in
[1:32:27] then the Rapture will go and that's what
[1:32:28] we want to try and do is encourage us to
[1:32:30] remember who we are and Satan will be
[1:32:34] powerless before us when we can
[1:32:36] recognize him within the framework of
[1:32:38] what the Christian Church where's the
[1:32:41] Christian Church Brothers and Sisters
[1:32:43] stop looking at the internet stop
[1:32:44] looking at at other churches around stop
[1:32:46] looking at one another stop look start
[1:32:48] looking inside this is the Christian
[1:32:50] church right here take a look inside and
[1:32:53] see if the spirit and if this flesh is
[1:32:55] getting the way of that Soul if it's
[1:32:57] getting in the way of that Soul peel
[1:32:58] them back crucify this flesh crucify
[1:33:01] your spirit and allow that soul to
[1:33:04] actually manifest the word of God in our
[1:33:06] lives and see what
[1:33:08] happens you know in Malachi 3 Verse 6
[1:33:12] maybe turn there with me we got five
[1:33:14] minutes five minutes I won't try and
[1:33:17] keep us I'll try not to keep us late but
[1:33:20] uh Malachi chapter
[1:33:24] 3 I know there's lots of scriptures
[1:33:28] we'll just skip across the pawn like
[1:33:30] we've talked about we'll just hit a few
[1:33:32] Malachi CH 3 Verse
[1:33:35] 6 for I am the
[1:33:38] Lord I change
[1:33:43] not therefore ye sons of
[1:33:47] Jacob are not
[1:33:49] consumed brothers and sisters tonight
[1:33:52] you are the sons of Jacob and and you're
[1:33:55] not consumed I'll call you the spiritual
[1:33:57] sons of Jacob Satan wants us to believe
[1:34:00] that God has changed that God can't hear
[1:34:03] our prayers that God won't hear our
[1:34:05] prayers that God don't hear our prayers
[1:34:09] maybe he's busy maybe he's on vacation
[1:34:12] maybe we just send away our day of Grace
[1:34:14] you know if you have the desire to serve
[1:34:17] the Lord brothers and sisters you ain't
[1:34:18] s send away your day of Grace if you got
[1:34:21] the desire to serve God then then
[1:34:23] there's something on the inside of the
[1:34:25] inside that's trying to speak through
[1:34:27] and you know we've had brother brandham
[1:34:28] say it that's the Holy Ghost knocking on
[1:34:30] the door of your heart saying open the
[1:34:32] door unto me uh there's no handle on the
[1:34:34] outside I can't open that door unto you
[1:34:36] like that that that that picture that
[1:34:38] we've seen so many times of Jesus
[1:34:40] standing on the outside holding the
[1:34:41] lantern knocking on the door and and we
[1:34:44] know that guy said there's no no you
[1:34:46] made a mistake in the picture you never
[1:34:47] put a handle on the outside that handle
[1:34:49] is only on the inside same thing with
[1:34:51] the the heart of a Believer it's only on
[1:34:52] the inside open that door once to him
[1:34:55] and just see if he won't come in and
[1:34:57] suck with you that's what the word of
[1:34:59] God says Satan wants us to believe that
[1:35:01] God has changed that he's tired he's old
[1:35:03] he's busy it's it's a it's a hectic
[1:35:06] world and we don't have the hotline to
[1:35:08] him but the only thing we've got to do
[1:35:09] is just like I said go on our knees
[1:35:11] brothers and sisters and take the time
[1:35:13] to actually push through all of this
[1:35:15] flesh get past this this flesh yes get
[1:35:18] past our spirit get past that Spirit
[1:35:22] don't just look for a new spirit get
[1:35:24] beyond that new spirit and get into the
[1:35:26] Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit Will
[1:35:29] begin to intercede for us to the throne
[1:35:32] of grace and when that happens that's
[1:35:34] when this Earth will shake that's when
[1:35:36] our lives will change all around us but
[1:35:39] if we're just going to church and we're
[1:35:40] just doing our duties and it's just a
[1:35:42] religion to us it's just a covering and
[1:35:44] Satan knows it and so does God you know
[1:35:47] what there's nothing going to happen in
[1:35:48] our lives we're going to just keep going
[1:35:49] in circles brother brandham said it is
[1:35:51] the definition of insanity doing the
[1:35:53] same thing over and over and over and
[1:35:55] over and over and thinking hoping
[1:35:58] praying that something different is
[1:36:00] going to come out of it nothing will
[1:36:03] come out of it natural saying that I've
[1:36:05] heard if you do what you've always done
[1:36:07] you're going to get what you've always
[1:36:09] got but if you're truly a son and
[1:36:11] daughter of God you'll only do it for a
[1:36:13] while and then he'll allow a pitfall a a
[1:36:16] speed bump to come along your way and
[1:36:18] something will trip you up and you'll
[1:36:20] have a little trial and that trial will
[1:36:23] take you back to to really what you need
[1:36:25] to do will begin to cry out to God
[1:36:27] because he's a a mutable in his nature
[1:36:30] as he is in his ways look at the
[1:36:31] children of Israel they would get saved
[1:36:33] they would have the enemies come in and
[1:36:35] thrash them and they would cry out to
[1:36:37] God save us oh look at our enemies look
[1:36:40] at us wo is us we've done so evil in the
[1:36:43] sight of the Lord and what would he do
[1:36:45] he would come and deliver them and he'd
[1:36:48] set them back up again and dust them off
[1:36:49] and say you're my children and you're in
[1:36:51] your Promised Land don't you worry just
[1:36:54] make sure that you serve me the way that
[1:36:56] I've instructed and then they would get
[1:36:59] comfortable in their position they would
[1:37:00] have all their bills paid and everything
[1:37:02] would be great in their lives and then
[1:37:04] they'd begin to let the bars down and oh
[1:37:07] my the enemy would start to come in and
[1:37:09] all these different evil things would
[1:37:10] begin to happen and before long the the
[1:37:12] gates are down and and and it's all just
[1:37:16] terrible and they cry out to God once
[1:37:19] again just like he's dealt with the
[1:37:21] children of Israel brothers and sisters
[1:37:23] we're no different we're Sons and
[1:37:26] Daughters of God but when we cry out to
[1:37:27] him his ears are open always every time
[1:37:30] we pray and he will come and pick us up
[1:37:34] and set us up upon a rock a rock of
[1:37:37] Revelation that we don't have to do this
[1:37:39] anymore we don't have to go in that
[1:37:41] Circle over and over and over again we
[1:37:43] don't have to continue on with these
[1:37:45] trials that never seem to
[1:37:48] end just feed on the word brothers and
[1:37:50] sisters and you won't even be a trial
[1:37:52] anymore that's the secret to it yes
[1:37:56] that's the key to it that I believe the
[1:37:57] Lord wants us to know forget about the
[1:38:00] trials and focus on the word yes don't
[1:38:03] look at the problems look at the promise
[1:38:05] continue to look at the promise look at
[1:38:08] the word of God feed on the word of God
[1:38:10] if you cannot read the word of God
[1:38:13] because of your time or whatever your
[1:38:15] pressures of Life press play you can get
[1:38:18] an audio Bible on your device
[1:38:22] and that audio Bible will actually play
[1:38:24] the word of God and just doing that
[1:38:26] creates an atmosphere because we know we
[1:38:27] read it that that blessed is he that
[1:38:30] that reads and hears the words of this
[1:38:33] prophecy so I want to say which prophecy
[1:38:35] some would say well it's only the Book
[1:38:36] of Revelation is it only the Book of
[1:38:38] Revelation I would say it's the entire
[1:38:40] word of God Amen play the word of God if
[1:38:43] you can't read the word of God feed upon
[1:38:45] the word brothers and sisters you will
[1:38:47] become the word and Satan will see that
[1:38:49] you are not lukewarm formal and
[1:38:52] Powerless you know it's man that
[1:38:55] actually has allowed allowed the idea to
[1:38:59] to happen Satan in man I'll call the
[1:39:02] musicians it's time to
[1:39:04] close but it's man that's actually done
[1:39:07] it it's Satan getting into man that's
[1:39:08] caused this idea that that God is maybe
[1:39:11] just a little bit different you know he
[1:39:12] he was really good in the prophet wasn't
[1:39:14] he he had a tremendous Ministry in in in
[1:39:17] William Mariam branham's life but why
[1:39:19] did William Mariam brandham have that
[1:39:21] tremendous Ministry because God chose
[1:39:23] him to actually go and have that
[1:39:26] Ministry why was that Ministry there why
[1:39:29] why do we have that Ministry it was to
[1:39:31] call a bride of his own choosing and
[1:39:34] that bride of his own choosing is
[1:39:35] supposed to actually have the same
[1:39:38] potentials as that Prophet did some
[1:39:41] people might say oh brother Barry that's
[1:39:43] going a little bit far but I I believe
[1:39:45] this with all my heart and I believe the
[1:39:46] real Believers believe it that he was
[1:39:48] the wave sheath that was actually waved
[1:39:50] the mature crop that was waved over top
[1:39:53] of the congregation to say blessed be
[1:39:55] the name of the most high God this is
[1:39:57] the mature level that you are going to
[1:39:59] come to those people who are able to
[1:40:01] take this book and eat it up they will
[1:40:04] actually come to full maturity and some
[1:40:06] people can take it and some people can't
[1:40:08] and that's okay because it's
[1:40:09] predestination nobody can put anybody in
[1:40:12] or take anybody out amen it's him that
[1:40:15] doth it all God bless you tonight stand
[1:40:17] with me as we close in
[1:40:19] prayer brothers and sisters it's same
[1:40:21] Pillar of Fire that's with us tonight
[1:40:23] right now in our lives he wants us to
[1:40:25] feed upon him he wants us to eat the
[1:40:27] book he wants us to know that he is just
[1:40:30] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:40:32] he's only listening to your voice he's
[1:40:34] only listening to our voice he's not
[1:40:36] looking at our flesh here on this
[1:40:38] world there's a reason why we have ears
[1:40:41] to hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:40:42] church it's because we already have a
[1:40:45] body waiting for us on the other side
[1:40:47] and nobody can see anybody here I don't
[1:40:50] see you and you don't see me we see this
[1:40:52] manifestation of this flesh this this
[1:40:55] this body that we're trapped in but we
[1:40:57] can't see the real you and the real me
[1:40:59] but you know what just keep pressing on
[1:41:01] brothers and sisters just like brother
[1:41:02] bradam saw in in that Vision just keep
[1:41:05] pressing on and one of these days
[1:41:07] Everything Will Change for us we will
[1:41:09] see our theophany bodies we'll see each
[1:41:12] other as we will be seen God bless you
[1:41:15] tonight let's just pray gracious
[1:41:18] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:41:20] word we thank you Lord for the
[1:41:21] encouragement that you are the same
[1:41:24] yesterday today and forever Lord and
[1:41:27] that you change not and that we are the
[1:41:29] sons of Jacob father we pray that Lord
[1:41:32] you would just continue to work in our
[1:41:34] lives Lord Jesus father sometimes we
[1:41:37] need a great trial sometimes father we

[1:41:42] circumstance in our lives to cause us to

[1:41:48] know that I've heard Brothers say it
[1:41:50] before Lord bring on the trial because
[1:41:52] that's what we want is to cry out unto

[1:41:56] ability to cry out without a trial then
