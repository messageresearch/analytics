your high that name of Jesus [Music] Christ Jesus the king [Music] [Applause] [Music] worship is Majesty Jesus who died now glorified king of all Kings amen God bless you this evening it's been a while I think I'm gonna thank the musician I have I think almost couple of hundred slides but there are a lot of pictures I know we shared a lot of pictures and videos with sister Lisa and the family so I hope you will not be stumbled with some of the pictures because it's a we want to show the law of contrast actually with this mission trip if there's you know some poor areas there are some rich areas good places bad places but the overall thing is when you meet the bride of Christ it's all good people amen because we have common denominator we have the Holy Spirit together amen and we're so thankful and to him and maybe while you're standing let's read the the scripture which is related to a little bit of missions it will be Romans 10. verses 13 to 16. I didn't put that in the slides but let's read it all together okay say Amen when you're there amen okay Romans 10 verses 13 2. 16 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved do we call him every time amen it means we're saved even before the foundation of the world Amen how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher you can see here even brother Branham his theme song is only believe because when you believe you will receive you will obey you will do all the things and act upon it amen and how would you believe without hearing the preaching of the word that's why we have fivefold Ministry and our trip is not in vain we believe that amen because we there are lots of good reports amen about this trip and let's hear let's continue verse 15 and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who had believer report we believe that we believe this report amen let's bow our hearts this evening oh Lord Jesus we are not worthy Lord before you unless you anoint us and send your Holy Spirit in us oh Lord but by the power that you have given us by the election that you have placed in us we are all made worthy we are all Justified we never did it in the first place because you destroyed all the evidence of our sins though we thank Lord that we have done all those things but by your blood Lord by your cleansing blood you already predestinated us elected us before the foundation of the world who whose report we will believe Lord accept your word Lord help us now Lord prepare our hearts Lord open our hearts may this little testimony Lord be a be a blessing to the hearers lord it's not it might not be a preaching or a teaching but uh it's a it's a testimony thing Lord of your goodness and mercy and Grace Lord in our lives as uh as we surrender unto you Lord wherever we go oh God may you be in the service Lord from the from the beginning to the end in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen amen praise the Lord I'll just read this quote before before starting the the presentation it's in the identified Christ of all ages let me just read it because it's a beautiful quote that Barbara Branham it's in 1964 April 1st the identified Christ of all ages he said but when you find Christian people where the holy spirit is no matter what nation amen how far in the jungle or whatever it is they do the same thing you do when you receive the Holy Ghost amen they do just the same thing they have the same Liberty amen we we are free from all sins amen we are we are Jubilee it has been preached amen they do they believe the same way and act the same way that any Christian does when he receives Christ did you receive Christ amen and we we know who we are we know what we are that's why we can relax and be at rest amen we might be laboring into that rest because that's the difficult thing to do is to labor and to rest because we are still in this flesh we are still in progress therefore we always fight we think that we can do something according to our uh capability but actually God wants us to surrender completely amen so that he can work on us so as I uh progress in the in the pictures I will I will share I will share the testimony if I can but then the thing the pictures paint a thousand words so let's see how it goes uh brother Josh or Isaac so our our report oops it doesn't show here bro okay there you go so December 2022 to January 2020 uh this January 20 23rd we went there earlier around two weeks earlier than the Johnsons uh and uh we prepared the way a little bit so that at least they they will be comfortable when they come and at the same time we have several uh churches that we visited as well because there are so many uh activities there during December because it's a holiday so all come meetings because there's so many message Believers in the Philippines and every church maybe one group has 35 churches in one group so they cannot fit in in one uh one camp meeting so there are several cup meetings and uh we were invited to attend but we can only attend one uh camp meeting because they're a little bit far as you know in Philippines though they are it's just 30 kilometers it will take you two hours three hours and it's a good experience by by them that so we don't take by kilometers we take by the hours how long it would take from one point to another point then convert it here that's how how far it is you can say when it's three hours it means from here to Edmonton right but actually you're going only to every maybe or yeah so that's how we we we take it so uh yeah so okay sorry it's uh December 14th I I actually my my wife arrived November 20th and then I followed December 14th and then miles I think uh December 21st and Lynn 20 on the 25th so our our children are 10 adults already so they have their own lives so they go to they work they go to school and for us I work and my wife works for me so so he she has all the time right Workshop right I work she shops so that's marriage right so she knows that she has that Revelation I guess so so she's happy with that and not not as a joke but uh it's good to to be revelated that way right so uh and and then when I arrived December 12th I I left here December 10th but uh uh the 15 hours difference is uh it's like another day so I arrived there December I I left December 10th and I arrived December 12th and immediately December 14th I already preached I was invited by Brother Valdez the pastor there in nuevasia which brother were very uh met after when when they arrived and it's been actually a School mate that we did that I didn't know I knew it last year when I first met him he he told me about uh about his teachers when he was in elementary and then he showed me those are my teachers I told him and so it means we were classmates without knowing it and and we graduated the same time in elementary I believe or or so so anyway we visited the church so I I preached there uh I spoke there Wednesday night and you can see uh he asked for help beforehand because uh because of this uh that that last camp meeting uh many people come on his church as well so he wanted to to pour some concrete so that they can put the tents and the church helped in advance and actually they put the concrete and we found we saw it and this is the work that they did before we came and they finished it somehow uh maybe 100 or 200 people come in in that church because it's just close by to the camp campsite so and then you can see they did the work and yeah this is how it looked in the inside and they did a lot of work also after this I'll show you so Burberry visited so these are not in uh chronological order but then the thing is that's the time already in in January when we we went there very was there too to visit it this is the last church we visited with brother Berry before they left and uh this is Brother Val is my and this is also a pastor in one of the churches there is Pastor Ray uh you can see the so they uh Bradberry had the heart to to help so he gave some amount and then they immediately you know uh uh painted the the church actually so they did some Renovations immediately because when you when you try to he has two outreaches basically and they are uh in progress of building the churches but then the thing is before you can do an Outreach you have to start with your church first right so he he started with this church but then it's not finished yet so Barbary has the the desire to to help and then actually they they did it immediately then he he gave me the pictures and this is the result now it's fully fully painted and somehow it's it's better it's air conditioned now because it's too hot there so they had all this stuff so you know little help uh you know it it makes a big difference to the church right so yeah and then this is the result actually but yeah lack of pictures but but that's uh how it progressed after after we left and then uh December 18th uh we went to Brad I was invited by brother Danny because uh I need to do the the work while the pastor is not there yet so I I represented Calgary Living Word there because there's so many churches there actually they've been so happy to to receive us and then they were so excited waiting for Barry to come and actually I I only filtered all the invitations otherwise Sister Lisa might not be able to come back anymore so all right so so to be honest they will work you out it's like in Africa I guess every day almost they want you to preach but it was a blessing actually so December 18th Sunday I was able to to speak and some of the the topics that I discussed there had been preached here because of course you have to preach here first and this this is our home church and we just want to share because being a let's say an evangelist or a missionary of course you have to have a home church right so you must be under a pastor and that's that's scriptural and that is as per the message of the hour you cannot just go by your own you have to be under a ministry under a local church right so we we respect that and we believe that amen and uh you can see the the church there so very established church and uh you know a brother Danny del mundo is is our friend and we introduce the Johnsons to the Del Mundos and actually they're good people and uh we love them and he has a lot of outreaches and then it's just like Roman Candle a pastor will be ordained and that Pastor will have another Outreach and Outreach and Outreach that's why they became bigger hopefully we can do that of course it's not it's not required to go overseas you can do it like what Barbara is saying this is a mission field we live here so this is our mission field amen so a million 1.2 million uh calgarians right so how many are we here we're not even maybe 200 or something but uh in there they that's what they do but uh I'm not saying we we should do what they're doing that we we will have a lot of outreaches but then the thing is they they live the life according to what has been uh preached by Brother Branham to to you know to uh to uh to preach the gospel and teach it and and witness to many people amen and uh it's been a blessing you can see that uh he was able to establish a lot of churches through through the help of the Lord of course because he was called he said you can say he's a missionary Pastor that's why he's come they're around 36 churches that congregated at that time they're around a thousand people that attended so uh it's been a pleasure to be a part of their uh their camp meeting amen so this one is just a normal Sunday service and uh this is their believer's Camp which is uh in one of the provinces it's around two hours from our hometown but uh maybe from Manila it's around three hours amen so so these are the ministers that uh that congregated in that camp meeting and uh yeah I felt uh humbled you can say because these are uh ministers who are preaching for 30 40 years that they've been in the message and some of them you can see their white hair they've been all over the world actually some of them but they're good people they're they're like us they believe the same message and it was a privilege to be part of that uh Believers Camp which is it's manifesting time right so that's their team and uh we know when we go for Missions we have to look for the last predestinated seat but it doesn't end there we must bring them in we must perfect them right through the preaching and teaching of the word so that they can manifest the fruit of the holy spirit amen and because that's the main thing we must manifest of who we are amen there's no there are only two seeds you can say all right the seed of God and Seed of The Serpent and and for us we believe that we're the the seed of God we have the germ seed of God that's why we believe the full word amen but then we're not putting out all those who who doesn't have the seed because by by uh by the grace that that will be given through us we can preach and extend the grace through through uh if they do something good to us we know that that's a different class of per people right the the the the the cup of cold water amen that's why my preaching here uh my topic here is uh uh it's the new bird will lead to Perfection because if you have the new birth which is the right Bird right or if you're uh interchange it with Jacob he knows his Birthright he was after the birth right but then you must have the right bird as well so that you can be perfected which is which is uh the new birth amen the new birth means it's uh the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to us the people that are being used the fivefold ministry will just preach the word but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to us that that will Quicken the seed that is in us because that seed was elected of God We cannot put any seed on anyone amen that's why for us it's just to look for those predestinated sin amen and along the way if we if they don't have seed but if they do good to us they can have uh they can enter into that eternal life amen although they didn't have eternal life from the beginning but they will be given eternal life by by being good to us amen that's why when we go anywhere we have to represent Jesus Christ whatever we do right and uh I know we our our work are very uh demanding of our time and I'm preaching to myself because the thing is since I came there's a lot people I mean there are things that that were left since uh since I left they are still there and I I have to I have to do them so we're not excused because that's I think that's the curse for for a man is to to to provide for the family and we're not complaining I'm just saying that although we need to do that but our Focus must must be the the real thing which is uh to to minister to the bride basically of Christ amen and and ministering meaning even though we don't uh speak here we still have to share the gospel to everyone witness to everyone the good news amen because no one would want uh anyone to go to hell even Barbara Branham is saying you don't want your enemy to go to to to hell because uh it's he was given the vision it's terrible Place amen that's why uh that's why we we have that burden to go amen uh it just happened that the Philippines is my uh Hometown that's why uh Brian I'm saying go to your people right then I speak the language so and I can relate uh and and the experience there like uh the comfort room that we have right so CR I know the the the boys have experienced it it's a comfort room it means it should be comfortable right but then the thing is uh you know the the way there is not like here but then the thing is the law of contrast that we we've been trying to uh uh for for the boys to to experience is uh we are really privileged people here in North America because if you go to a third world country you you won't expect the the all the Comfort here in North America here you have a lot of choices you have a lot of things that you enjoy but then people still complain great amen but there whatever they have I will show you later on and uh some of the people that we met and we have it's it's really a law of contrast and it will it will humble you it will make you uh think from a different perspective that you we are really blessed here we have everything that we need here amen and uh but the thing is the the Christ that we have here they have they have it there too and that's the good thing amen so yeah I was able to to speak there uh and uh you can see the the people there it's yeah around a thousand they're saying they're they're 35 36 churches that they they they they congregated basically and uh oh I think this one these are the tents that they they put there so actually Barbara and the family also went in this place when after the camp and then they they have seen it firsthand what uh what the campus I know there's still a lot of work there but they're planning to have the the international youth meeting I think in 24 2024 so yeah uh they will invite all the youth worldwide I think because the last time they did they have limited space but in this case they can invite many many people and yeah young people from Europe are already expecting it because the ministry actually it's a bit uh spread out because he has been invited in Europe in U.S and uh and and some other in Asia basically so yeah and their their family is a wonderful family they are friends with many people so and they are friends and they are the friends of Johnsons now so they are in contact with them but anyway so this is the the camp campsite where they where they typically stay so these are their tents and this basketball court at least for recreation they they will put the you know a covered Court they will convert this to a covert card but of course it will be Progressive it will be a lot of money to to do it but then the thing is they're just believing uh because God will provide for sure and uh we believe with them amen and they're actually there's uh they will build the dormitory here when we went there they're already pouring concrete uh beside here so it will be a dormitory and then this will be a covert Court that's what they're uh doing right now okay and uh these ones are are the ministers and and this brother brother Roger he's been with me in in Qatar we sleep together he saw is my friend and almost like a real blood brother and uh he's now the pastor in one of the churches there and then we met after how many years now over 10 years 15 years and we were so happy to meet and he replaced the the dad of sister Sabel Isabel the wife of brother Danny because he passed away the the dad of sister Isabel and he was the one who who got ordained to be the the pastor just recently I think last year and I was so happy to to meet him and he's a good brother and we sleep side by side in Qatar and we just met after many many years and I was so happy to to meet him again so yeah so this one is a briefing for the uh for those nine people who decided to get baptized so I gave them the briefing why they need to be baptized and because they decided after the service Sunday I think and then I was I was uh delegated to to do the to do the honors basically so there are nine Souls that uh that accepted but uh you know every cup meetings they they're harvesting Souls you can say you know one one soul is priceless amen ten thousand worlds that's its worth and that's why for every bride we must know that our price is the blood of Jesus Christ it's very you can say you if the devil is telling us who that we are worthless now we can just resist the devil and tell him about God's promises in the Bible right so because the thing is we are sinless but less bride of Jesus Christ that's why looking for the last predestinated is very important amen that's the work that we we we are uh happy to do amen and uh as you can see uh there's no uh they just have this and then we did the baptism here and I was not immersed I know we we discussed me and Briar Berry because some some people are are saying is that really proper when when the one that is baptizing is not immersed uh with water because but then the thing is when you check the word baptized comes from the Greek word baptizo meaning totally immersed who is totally immersed the one that is being baptized is not the one that is baptizing so I I don't see any technicality there but uh it's good to you know when when you're thinking because some some ministers are are commenting on that but uh for me I mean for us when we discuss I don't see any issue that uh as long as he the person is totally immersed basically because in Romans 6 with his death we are dead with him with this Resurrection we are resurrected with him amen that's that's the thing and uh and we must totally die to ourselves so that we can live and be born again amen so nine Souls were baptized and you can see even a younger one because actually one of the pastors were questioning about the the baptism how how old are you oh yeah I'm eight oh you cannot but I stop him you know what there's no stopping in uh in the desire of anyone because uh even John the Baptist right he was baptized with the Holy Ghost when he was in the womb so the thing is that that's how it is and then we allowed and I told him I will baptize him there's no there's no issue because it's scriptural and and even Branham said that uh don't you know the desire of the of the child we must honor amen it's very important and we we prayed for them and uh here uh we distributed Bibles around 100 Bibles and uh you can see these are pastors actually because there's so many that got baptized and they didn't have the Bible so we help on that on that end around 100 Bibles were distributed you can see here these are Pastors in different places actually so it's it's good to to see people from different walks although they they speak we speak the common uh Filipino or Tagalog language but then they they're from different provinces so it's good to to see and it's our first time to meet a lot of pastors also amen so yeah so the Bible's here and we distributed some goodies as well which is uh these are spaghetti and some coffee three in one I think the favorites now of of the boys and uh yeah so to to the to the Indigent members uh who who came uh I think last time I I mentioned that uh for two days they traveled by land they walked because uh because it was Isis uh uh it's uh there's there was a storm at that time but in this case they were able to use their their boats so it just took them maybe half day to to come to to this uh uh camp meeting but last time it took them two days to to walk then they just slept ever walked eight hours and then slept in in some Villages there and then come so for 24 48 Hours of travel by by walking amen but uh in this case uh it was better so we were able to to distribute some goodies as well okay uh and this one are the members of brother Danny already because the the camp is already done at that time Sunday so we just have a little bit of a picture here amen and January 1st I was uh because I didn't have any plan but then uh we went to one of the churches which are close to our house which is just 30 minutes away and the pastor has been asking me if I don't have any plans so I he asked me to to speak for him his name is brother Joel uh archibido and uh you can see yeah I I want to to share a testimony here because this is the brother of my wife this is Brother Ray Ray is his name he I I think uh in November I think before I came there or maybe early December before I came uh my wife invited him to attend this church and he's not a Believer but he believes the Bible and then the good thing is now he's already attending this church and he brought his family with him and uh we're believing with him and he's the one who's sharing what the message that is being preached by the pastor and the pastor is my friend and uh I told him just you know be gentle with them because they are new but uh it's a good it's a it's a young church but uh I know they're preaching the word and and brother Ray my brother-in-law is very uh uh received receiving of uh he he receives what what is being preached and that's a the greatest testimony that we can say because uh we want our family to be in in the message right if uh that's our sincere desire because we don't want everyone to be lost amen and uh we're thankful to that and at the same time next slide here these are my brothers and sisters when they know when they knew that I will be preaching in in that place and they are close by I only invited my sister uh who who was a former Pentecostal before and he believes the Bible and then he said I will come he said he came from Saudi and we we had the reunion and then all my other siblings were there and then they said I we want to come too we want to hear from you so actually it was a blessing I was touching the I I picked them up and the whole van was full with the with my sisters and my brother and my nephews and it's a blessing actually and and after the the service they gave a good report and then they're they're telling me how how did you know all of those I told them I didn't know them but the thing is it's they are in the Bible and then because I I preach about the the prophet so they heard about it so they didn't question anything but that we believe for our families because the thing is we can represent them they might not have the ears to to hear the word but it will be according to to the one speaking it's Ezekiel 37 amen when when Ezekiel was uh prophesying to that bones they are not only bones they are dry bones they didn't have have any ears to hear but then they heard because Ezekiel was asked by the by God to prophesy to the bones to have uh to have signed used to have you know their Dry Bones they didn't have any ears to hear we know Faith Comet by hearing the word but these Dry Bones didn't have any ears but they followed what the prophet said that's why you see we we can say that uh Ezekiel was given the proper instruction and he didn't know what to do he was always asking God God what should I do we should be like that right because God wants us to be led and we should be uh teachable and we should be able to be led otherwise God cannot lead us because we will be pushing back but then in this case Ezekiel just said tell me Lord and then he followed and then you see after that the the bones heard something and then they they had the the skin the the the bow I mean the the sinus everything and then after that what did he do he breathed on them which is the bread of life which is the eternal life amen it's the same for Abraham amen before it was Abram but then because of the Breath of God he became Abraham I know I think it's brother Wayne Lawson who mentioned that but the letter AIDS there that's why Branham right it's it's a bread of life everything that we we we breathe and even Sarai he became Sarah we know that uh being Abram I I suck is not the son of Abraham he's a son of Abram right I mean what I'm saying is the first son is Ishmael Ishmael is not a son of Abraham he was a son of Abram right because he's not the promised one but then when he was given the bread of life when the when they change the body Branham is saying he became Abraham and then he and and then Sarai became Sarah and then they they got Isaac which is the promise and what I'm saying here is the bread of life can come through the body amen and we we've been preaching the son of man Ministries through the bride right now because uh brother Branham already left the scene and we are continuing that Ministry I think brother Berry just preached last Sunday oh he said Sunday I think so yeah that he's the Alpha and Omega in the in between but since the in between he's not here where is he now he's in the bride right now because the Holy Spirit is Jesus Christ himself in us we're continuing that Ministry and then later on we he will come we will be with him together amen so the bride is the in between because Christ is in the bride amen it it will end up the same because uh Christ is the mystery of God rebuild and the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed the bride is revealing Christ amen and and we're fulfilling that second purpose of God and what's the purpose or or what's the result when we uh when we fulfill the second purpose we will go back to Eden condition again and that means that's why we're the product product of the third pool which is speaking word condition amen we're the Bride of the eighth day amen so when we realize who we are it's always being harped on here or being pretty cheap that uh once we receive or we know what we are and who we are then the Rapture will go but it's already happening right now right we're just waiting for the actual meeting in the air it's only the chains of body that we're changing we're waiting for but if we die we die with the Lord if we live we live with the Lord therefore we live or we die we are we are the Lords so why worry amen so so what I'm saying is uh we have the power to speak right even though they cannot hear but God will hear the the the faith of the one that is speaking and that's us because God revealed it to us amen and we're so thankful and to that amen so so you can very popular song in the Philippines and goodness of God so that's how just so that you can see the then here comes the fun when they arrived January 3rd uh so we met in the airport and then we flew directly to to this island called the Quran and the airport is busuanga it's around an hour five minutes flight from Manila so this is I think I think his sister Lisa's uh picture this is the top view of or aerial view of Quran you can see the the good things there so yeah and we saw all this this came from our own cameras not not from Google so yeah so just I think some already saw this but I mean with the family but you can see the so we were able to to get our own boat there and uh so that we can go where not so many people are where the naked people are because we have our own world we created our own world because we have that power right so we just spoke the word and we we did it amen so yeah we you see the Coconuts there we some of the the bucket list of the boys I think were were checked you can say amen there's a lot of good fruits there tropical fruits coconut CIS and mangoes you can say there's a lot yeah okay so you see after after uh 15 hours of flight or 17 hours of flight so we have to make them Rest by going to the to the ocean I guess so and yeah this is this is a true story and it's not a Photoshop right so you yeah it's a beautiful place actually that's why I've been I've been saying when I introduced Branham our brother buried uh before he speaks uh when I told them that we came from Quran I told them if might have if if brother Branham visited coron he might have said also that he he would be a Filipino in the Millennium yeah it's so bad but you know because it's beautiful I think to cease to believe but then to feel also is to to believe it right so it's warm water blue turquoise yeah so yeah we have a very good photographer which is our tour guide the brother dodong and I will have a story I will not try to I'll check my time I hope you're not bored amen okay so we did a lot of uh a little bit of hiking here because this one is uh I forgot the lake you have to hike up and then hike down and this is a popular picture taking location so and then you will see all the things and then we had another day of fishing we rented another boat by ourselves at this uh of course with brother dodong uh we so I hope you're not stumbled that we we visited this but the thing is uh it's a good thing to show that there are good places also and then there are bad places but then the thing is with the bride wherever you go if you're with the bride you're always be sitting in Heavenly places because you're always talking about the Lord amen and and plus the the nature this is given by God and then we should just have to visit them it's not because we wanted to go or or you know to to take a real real vacation but this is not an expensive vacation because we know the people right uh brother don't know the owner of the boat that's why we were able to to uh to rent it and it's not it's not expensive that's what my point is amen if you know someone that's why the bread is the most connected person on Earth wherever you go is there a church here yes okay can I contact oh you you stay in our place you know and it happened right wherever you go look for the church amen that's the first thing that you need to do is there a church there amen yeah so yeah we had a God gave us a very good son here because the first day we we went there is a it's kind of rainy so but the next day the sun you can see the blue and and we I think I we caught how many five or so I think Isaac and Benjamin they they caught a lot yeah quite a few you can see oops sorry okay yeah and uh this is brother dodong actually but then the thing is we ask uh before we we went there we asked for a Believer uh Believers Church and then they gave us some contacts and then we contacted them and then they gave they told us that uh a certain brother dodong is a tourist guide in one of the uh tour tour companies there so we contacted that tour uh to our company and then we want the tour guide to be brother dodo and then they gave us brother dodong and this is brother dodong but then the thing is when when we met him he's wearing shorts he's uh and then he's talking about uh his presbyter having Revival and everything but uh we every all of those uh statements we didn't think uh twice that he's a Believer maybe he's just new in the message but then later on we found out that he he's another brother dodong there's another brother dodong that is a real message believer but he's a message but he is a very sweet guy and now he asks us to uh for help basically uh regarding what we believe because he saw the life in us so he wants to to preach to his family he wants to know the word so right now we we prepared some Bibles and and and the message of the hour in his own language and it's ready to be shipped we were able to to secure some message of the hour uh translated in in his local language and thank we thank the message hub for that because they printed a lot of uh those things you can see that there are there are good things that will result from from those because uh he he doesn't speak English very well but then the thing is if if he will uh read the the message in English he might not understand but there's some translation in the local dialect of my wife basically so yeah it's ready to be shipped and uh we want him to be connected with brother Dany also so that at least he can be in the right uh right atmosphere and right teaching but then the thing is yeah you can see this is his family he has six children and he has this uh motorbike with this they call it kalon kalon so this is how they they uh commute there so uh Bradberry has the heart to to help him because that when while we were there he got the motorbike uh you know broken so with hundred dollars I guess he was able to fix it so praise the Lord and then they visited Us in the in the hotel and uh they are sweet people you can see but the the thing is uh you know uh what I'm saying is about the law of contrast we might be living luxurious here or or comfortably but then we visited their home and I'll show you the picture this is their home so we went there like a mission trip you can see The Shanty here where they live so you can see their small table here this is where they cook with coal or or wood then this is uh where's there yeah this after the picture this is maybe four by four this is all their room with with eight people uh uh sleeping on it so the mother mom and dad and the six uh children they're all uh living here or sleeping here that's that's how they they live there so and his job is a tour guide which is around uh twelve dollars a day that's that's his pay and then when we met him he was so uh blessed and he was saying it was a pleasure knowing you and he thanked us a lot because of course we gave him tip and uh because we thought he was a Believer also and he's good to us and you know he's a very good tour guide we went a lot a lot of uh you can say uh uh snorkeling and uh diving and all this stuff he he was a very good uh person amen but we tried to help him because because he has a good heart amen and he was blessed we are blessed too amen so this is the church we we didn't think of anything here because it says it says Jesus Christ believer church but then when I asked the people from Manila do you know this church they said no and then they're talking about a presbyter so it look we found out later that they're Presbyterians and uh they're talking about their their Bishop basically their their Presbyterian who's doing the Revival but then when we met him me and Barbarian and it looks like it's kind of aloof but anyway so at least we we can extend our Grace to them amen and uh I think that this is the wife of the pastor there and this is the president you can see so there's some red flags are these real Believers because they're all in shorts I guess almost so looks like they're not and then we found out later but then without knowing at all but uh you don't judge right but then until until you find out but it's good to meet them actually this pastor here he's the pastor he had the he had a very good testimonial as well he was shot many times I guess and he showed all the bullet uh all the old bullet holes in his in his body and his uh leg Yeah so he's a living testimony of of what God is doing although he's not a Believer yet we're claiming that they're not Believers yet but then the thing is time comes when who knows berardo might be the instrument to to uh because he's the brother-in-law of brother they live close by so they they're just side by side in the same area basically okay so this is our hotel and they visited us before we left the Quran and uh yeah it's another so actually this one is a it's not sequential so miles just and my wife prepared this but then the thing is we were hoping to go to an island that where nobody is and actually Christopher was hoping that there will be a coconut in that Island and then God gave us the favor right and we we ducked the boat ducked in this island and where we were alone but there there are a couple and a little child that that were living here for decades the little child is just two years old it's the it's their grand grandson but then you can see the the thing there is a white beach with the uh warm water so we did a lot of swimming and snorkeling here so that's uh Christopher he's back at least to to go up the coconut tree amen and uh oh is that Miles you cannot see him but that smiles too uh yeah these are the couple and then yeah this is the young their grand grandson basically so we did a lot of uh uh kayaking also amen so January 7 we went back to Manila then that started the uh for Burberry to minister so January 7th we have a little bit a little get-together uh with with the young kids and also we played the uh some gym it's a gym night basically so actually uh just a little bit of a testimony the the lady on the left here uh she lost a child when when when the child was about to be one year old that's what I heard and and the second one is Micah the sister or daughter-in-law of brother Danny and then she's praying they are praying for for a child and then why am I why am I uh telling these stories because when Barbara Berry preached the next day on the 8th he talked about uh he talked about the testimony of losing a child and that related to the person and then I think he was the one who was shouting and uh and then at the same time the other one is Micah who's praying for a for for your chat for a child and then he actually he's a very good com she she is a very good composer and a and a singer and she just sung that song during that time and uh I forgot the the lyrics uh isn't it that I gave you Isaac something like that and then Bradberry preached on it that uh that they have Isaac after after Timothy then it was real blessing then you can you can see the the move of the Holy Spirit during the service and yeah yeah the testimonies are personal right so the thing is no one can take them away it's like what education is is if you're educated no one can take it away if the holy spirit is with you no one can take it away from you amen and it's the same with our testimony they are personal and they are I cannot borrow some somebody somebody else's testimony right and uh and it it it was a great service you can I can say that and uh there's there are lots of uh good things that they they they posted and then they they told us and and we sent them to to Burberry because they're thinking brother for coming you know the Pastoral thing that they preach here like the proper positioning of uh the the husband the wife and the children it was a real blessing even brother Daniel was telling me it was done it was a great uh mission trip you can say because a pastor will it's a pastoral message that that they receive amen and they were thankful about it and he preached a perfect strength and perfect weakness on the morning of the of uh of January 8th and then yeah you can see here that's the song service okay some pictures after the service uh you know every time there's a lot of food but I didn't show a lot of food there uh and in the evening we went to uh elect bright assembly I think sister Shelley and bra Ken went there and uh with Brother Ray Ray Soriano uh we we he uh brother very preached there too so you can see yeah this the one I like bright assembly I think sister Shelley might I think brother Ken was sitting on on the other side here before uh when we when we streamed that and uh they are also very established church and they have maybe 600 800 people and then they have five groups and they cannot fit in in this small uh church that's why they're they're planning to build a bigger church and imagine only two groups can fit and then they have five groups so it means two in the morning two in the evening and one will not be in the church will be streaming right so it's a it's a it's a bit challenging and uh yeah it's a very established church and uh yeah they love the they love the world basically we had a very good Fellowship after as well uh with the I'll skip some and this is Brother Ray basically Brother Ray Soriano so yeah we have some pictures here and Hometown Angeles this is our home when we went that's our rest rest Place basically so we have actually a one one three here which it's called Chico and we call it the Mana tree because every day there are some droppings they are very sweet like you can say sugary uh sugary fruit that it's like real sugar and they're very sweet every morning because the bats will take the the good ones and they will drop because we don't have anything to to to go up the trees they they just drop so every day there's there's some monetary maybe around five or six big ones and we just cut them and I think the boys love them so and sister Lisa and Barbara too so we have a good Fellowship here lots of coconuts as well here and actually this is a mango tree but it doesn't bear fruit yet yeah lots of food local ones and we visited one of the churches one of the outreaches of browardani also which is a church that that is being built and uh Burberry has that desire also to help and he gave them a little help here I think for the roof so we will find the roof we will see the roof we will see the the result you can see and uh we know that's that's the reason why it's good also to go there by ourselves and then we will see the actual work it's not only by picture so you can see they got the picture with the with the thing and then later on you will see how it evolves how it progresses amen so I know that that's Mission so yeah it's kind of pretty good sized building yeah and we gave Bibles as well amen yeah this is the pastor Pastor June uh lots of food again they waited for us although we were late yeah so but they they always serve you like a king or whatever the best that they have they will serve you that's the that's how they that's how the bride serves the bride you can say Amen so and I forget how old was she 90 93 and then they have a good conversation she's very good in English and and she said you are like me you're beautiful so yeah so we are both beautiful she said so yeah and another church so this is in the evening already uh very very pretty and burden is always the The Interpreter in Tagalog amen so actually he was asking where Barry was asking Josh the technician how come we don't do this he said but he in in the Philippines it's very common that while I will read or or whoever the preacher is uh if he doesn't have the notes then it will be posted like this together while while he's uh reading the quotes and they can do that even the scriptures so maybe we should do that maybe that's that's doable right so and it's not it's they've been doing this since maybe 10 years ago even when briarcan was there I think they've been doing that so it means it's not a new technology but we should just adopt it because it's very convenient when okay open this and then someone will post it right the scripture and the quotes and with the technology it's easier to do amen so yeah okay and this side uh pictures lots of pictures it's good to visit the the the bride of Christ wherever they are because you have a common denominator you're always talking about the Lord amen there's nothing No Malice no nothing it's always the Lord amen the goodness and uh you know it's that's why we if there's a chance of course we want to go again uh that's that's the thing it's not it's not because uh we live there that's why we have a we have a place there so if we are there then might as well you know visit the churches because uh you'll never know how how you could be a blessing to them they are being blessed and you are blessed and the fellowship the the thing that you're learning and then you can feel their pain also it means because this world is not our home right and here we're always Bound By by work basically and and the things that we want to achieve here uh naturally but then for them I think of course they want to strive as well but then the thing is even they are poor they have the Lord that's why they're always happy you can say uh depression There is almost not a a word before but uh yeah yeah because their life is typically the depression itself it's kind of there's so many there's so many places there that are not so well off it's really just you know 12 a day that's that's just your McDonald's Maybe right so but for them that's their whole thing for the day so yeah but uh with the churches that's their Oasis when they gather together and then you can see the food that they serve to us it's a lot we had the feast we had the spread at that time amen I will try to okay I still have a video uh miles prepared a video after this also we we gave the the ministers some bags because they do missions and then they do mostly most of the time they do a motorbike so yeah we give them backpacks these are all pastors and yeah and you can see some relaxation sometimes because every other day you have to relax because you have to travel two hours here two hours there so our bodies need to relax too that's why I cannot blame sister at least I get a little bit ill but amen but God is in control amen and this is the place where where there's a lot of fun also here we had a lot of coconuts and this for this one the church donated the the flooring here so before there's no it's it's uh it's what they call dirt but now you can see they already poured the concrete and the church helped on that and and very very pretty oh I think it's not actually preaching our only exhortation because sister Elisa was not feeling well at that time so it's only around 30 minutes or so but we had a good time here with the a lot of food as well and uh okay and then this is another church where we went and where where Christopher uh gave the special amen and uh yeah okay and uh hey lots of pictures with the this is brother Danny basically okay just to so that you would know I think yeah this is brother Danny is the the one who's our host Pastor basically he was the one who who arranged the itinerary and this is his wife and these are pastors wives basically so these are other pastors I know you you won't remember them so I won't mention their name so and the young people lots of young people and uh you can see the church was full at that time it's a Wednesday night but you can see uh lots of people and then again food right so yeah these are the pastors close by so they they just congregated together in one so that it's a joint Fellowship if we can do that that's so nice I mean with different churches congregating why not right so and you're preaching the same word anyway amen and yeah this is the camp Campground where we went after so we we we had some pomelos we we picked some fruits there so and yeah we had the good Fellowship with the with the brothers there and we picked ourselves uh dos pomelos you might find them in Superstore right so yeah and this is the eagle you might have seen it that brother bear is uh so it was given this one was curved by a brother it was given to brother Danny but then it was a blockade for brother Berry so you will find it it's it's amazing it it was handcrafted very very nice amen so yeah okay some of the good stuff there up to relax and there are some a houses that they will build so that if a visiting Minister will come or if we will be there so it will be a maybe around five by four meters and then it will be just like a house that that will be built there will be a prototype and then it will be mass produced whoever wants to have an area there because it's a pretty decent size of a of a campground so whoever has the money then he will be allowed to it's just like a timeshare but then for those who who has money only right so it might cost around uh I don't know three maybe five thousand dollars that's all to finish with all all of it but it depends on how far you want to go then it will be like a timeshare maybe one week there and you will have a good time with the Believers amen so yeah we we got one so whoever will come will have that place so yeah so and this is our place before we left so yeah uh this basketball court before we before we came it's not there but then the thing is uh it was so that at least the boys can can enjoy and we enjoy too and Miles also for a short time yeah so this is our home there we have this our compound and this is the del mundo family that visited us and yeah January 15 because we extended a bit and then immediately they asked can you please the next day so okay uh yeah we we went to this is one of the outreaches of brother Daniel so you see how established now they yeah they they're kind of and the young people are the ones who are funding the finishing of the church so that's how how good they are of course to start it it came from Joe Green from North Carolina with little maybe I don't know uh seven thousand five hundred dollars to start but then the thing is this one is already around maybe 20 000 already but through the through the local ones so of course you must have skin in the game right it must be the members who who should be uh uh continuing it's not always asking money but to start of course this is in Manila so it's very expensive to to get uh to get the uh a lot or or a property and it was a very good testimony they told us they just they said there's some uh ghosts there that's why they wanted to sell that's why it was very cheap that they had and the ghost now it became a Holy Ghost yeah amen so yeah there's a lot of good testimonies there okay so yeah these are this this is the pastor uh Pastor Dennis and these are his deacons actually seven years ago we were able to to visit and the church is still starting and we were they asked me to pray for the deacons uh because at that time they're just starting and now it's kind of very established already if you if you see it it's they they did a very good job and it's because of the young people and and of course the members so they have burden for their church right that's why they they grew amen so yeah okay so maybe I'll I'll show the the video that Miles uh prepared and then we can we can close uh it's it's not sequential but at least you will find a little bit of a summary of what we did good uh I mean mostly good I guess the one that he showed the uh but uh you can see God is good amen and uh I know we don't have much time you can see the the goodness of the Lord and wherever you go if if you're bringing the name of the Lord you will act like like him amen and you want to conduct yourself uh the way he wants us to uh you know to live our lives and it will be a blessing and there were lots of uh messages that I received for Briar Berry that they were so thankful although they were just streaming one is he was streaming in Qatar and then she told me she texted me that uh I hope next time I will be there in person I was really blessed with the with the with the preaching of brother he said she said so you know wherever we are right so as long as long as you you're bringing the word and the message you won't go wrong basically and uh we we're not bringing anything new it's always it's always the word of God that we that we bring that's why we don't worry at all maybe if you're okay miles is there a sound let me see also I I haven't seen it much so maybe I'll watch it too thank you come before you today there's just one thing that I want to say you Lord you Lord for all you've given to me Stars in my life you look great Lord we thank you today Jesus but that same voice is in the bride tonight [Applause] God always uses men amen right until about age four uh Christopher effort from pneumonia I see Christopher I uh pneumonia all right hungry amen I think that's all I have I I'll call Barbara maybe he can add something but you can see the yeah like what he said last Sunday if you wanna if if I would go to Nigeria of course it's like a preview and I see uh brother Faron and and brother Toby and her Jen right so how how they they are here we will see them the same as what they do there and it's a blessing when you go with the with the with the people who live who lived there before and uh so that at least you you don't know that the terrain of the the area so it's better to go with the with the brother who lived there before right so and uh and it's good here I heard it preach that uh yeah like Briar can we have I think 14 nationalities here so it means we don't need to go all those places we will we will meet the bride in different from different nations and we're so thankful though if we have the chance to visit the the place of our brothers here it will be it will be a it will be a real blessing it will be a life-changing experience the way I see it and uh I think I'll call barbaria you might have some uh thing that he can add yeah that's all I we were able to prepare I hope it's a blessing and amen and maybe stand with me tonight call the musicians up I don't know if I have a lot to add other than just can't help but think about that quote you know the building is fine we need to have the building we need to have the infrastructure but really the beauty of the church is the character of the people and every single place that I've gone to I've had the pleasure to go to I haven't been able to go to many but to Kenya with brother Gilbert and you know to Philippines now with Panetta's the people that you meet when you meet believers it's uh Same Spirit can we sing goodness of God as we close tonight I highly recommend it if anybody wants to do a trip see if you can go with your brother your sister go meet their people go to their country see what they do there's nothing like it I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me I've been held hails [Music] all my life [Music] I'm I love you have led me through

worthy to be Sons and Daughters father to be considered to be those ones father that we sang at the beginning of the service I'm one of them Lord rather greater than any Lottery that we could ever win

name them one by one father and Lord if we miss a few I'm pretty sure you'll you'll give us Grace for it Lord father we just can't express our love for you we thank you for the Believers in Philippines Lord Jesus thank you for the opportunity to go and meet with the Lord to meet the pastors father Lord we just want to pray for them the pastors and and the leadership Lord of this message
