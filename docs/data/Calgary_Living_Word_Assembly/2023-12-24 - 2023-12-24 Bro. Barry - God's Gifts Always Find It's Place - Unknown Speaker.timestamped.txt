[0:47] tremendous blessing it is to hear the
[0:51] voice I'll say voice of all the little
[0:55] children God bless you Sister Shelly for
[0:58] doing that for having that on your heart
[1:01] every single
[1:06] year to hear the voice of the youth the
[1:09] voice of the children God bless
[1:12] you Aunt
[1:14] Ruth my seeing faces all over the place
[1:17] here but just to uh hear the voice of
[1:21] worship coming from the children going
[1:24] back to my thought you know how uh we
[1:26] don't know how long the Lord's going to
[1:28] T we we we've heard it said many times
[1:31] from some of the old folks that they
[1:33] expected to see the Rapture happen yeah
[1:36] who knows when maybe the the time that
[1:39] brother brandham fell off the scene that
[1:41] that he was promoted into heaven that
[1:44] the Rapture was supposed to take place
[1:45] that was 50 60 years ago and you know
[1:48] who knows brothers and sisters there
[1:50] could be 50 60 more years we don't want
[1:52] to try and put a time stamp on what
[1:54] God's doing this is his work we're just
[1:57] going to be soldiers laboring in the
[1:59] field for him
[2:00] and if we don't train up these children
[2:02] in the way they should go who's going to
[2:04] be the next
[2:05] church it's very important for us to do
[2:09] and uh I just think it's a tremendous
[2:11] tremendous thing that's happening to see
[2:14] all these young people you know brothers
[2:15] and sisters I just want to say this I'm
[2:17] just going to preach today I hope it's
[2:19] okay I just want to say this when when
[2:21] we renovated this building we had a
[2:23] discussion wondering is there going to
[2:24] be people that will come into this
[2:26] building and I look out here today and
[2:28] we can see it that it's full oh it's a
[2:30] tremendous blessing brothers and sisters
[2:36] we maybe for those people that don't
[2:39] know this used to be a community center
[2:41] and where that Nursery is the back
[2:42] window there that used to be a whole
[2:44] kitchen and up here there used to be a
[2:46] bathroom on this side I think it was the
[2:48] men's on that side and the ladies was on
[2:50] this side and the stage was probably
[2:52] another two feet higher and there was a
[2:54] big big bulkhead that went across here
[2:56] and when when we renovated this when we
[2:58] took it all apart and put it all back
[3:00] together again we framed it all and we
[3:02] had so many conversations will there be
[3:05] Sunday school that will come and sing
[3:07] the Praises of the Lord here on this
[3:10] stage and we can say that that that that
[3:13] scripture that uh that prophecy those
[3:15] words have been fulfilled maybe it's not
[3:18] a scripture but you know it's just a
[3:21] tremendous thing it goes more goes much
[3:24] further than just saying you know isn't
[3:25] it nice to see all the little kids
[3:27] gathered on the stage brothers and
[3:28] sisters we had prayed about this we had
[3:31] labored for this and here we
[3:34] are what a tremendous thing if you have
[3:37] your Bibles this morning I would just
[3:38] like to uh read a scripture out of
[3:41] Matthew Chapter 2 we're going to talk
[3:44] about the Christmas story today maybe
[3:46] from a little bit of a different
[3:47] perspective we'll just see what the Lord
[3:49] has in store and then uh I I just want
[3:51] to follow along what brother bradam
[3:53] preached on here out of a
[3:55] message that he preached in
[3:58] 1963 after this seals were preach God's
[4:00] gifts always find their
[4:03] places and brother Ram talks about this
[4:06] message in here we'll just start reading
[4:08] with verse
[4:09] one of Matthew Chapter
[4:12] 2 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[4:16] of Judea in the days of Herod the king
[4:19] behold there came wise men from the East
[4:21] to Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[4:25] born King of the
[4:28] Jews for we have have seen his star in
[4:30] the east and are come to worship
[4:33] him when Herod the king had heard these
[4:36] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[4:39] with
[4:40] him and when he had gathered all the
[4:43] chief priests and scribes of the people
[4:45] together he demanded of them where
[4:48] Christ should be
[4:49] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[4:52] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[4:56] prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land
[4:59] land of Judea art not the least among
[5:02] the princes of Judah for out of thee
[5:05] shall come a governor that shall rule My
[5:08] People
[5:09] Israel then Herod when he had privily
[5:12] called the wise men inquired of them
[5:14] diligently what time the star
[5:17] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[5:20] and said go and search diligently for
[5:22] the young child and when he have found
[5:25] him bring me word again that I may come
[5:28] and worship him also
[5:30] also when they had heard the king they
[5:34] departed and lo the star which they saw
[5:37] in the East went before them till it
[5:40] came and stood over where the young
[5:42] child
[5:43] was when they saw the star they rejoiced
[5:47] with exceeding great joy and when they
[5:50] were come into the house they saw the
[5:52] young child with Mary his mother and
[5:55] fell down and worshiped him and when
[5:58] they had opened their treasure measures
[5:59] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[6:03] frankincense and myrrh yes and being
[6:06] warned of God in a dream that they
[6:08] should not return to Herod they departed
[6:12] on their own departed into their own
[6:15] country another way if you'll turn with
[6:18] me over to St
[6:24] John John chapter 3 very familiar
[6:28] scripture
[6:30] John 3:
[6:41] 16 it's the same God today brothers and
[6:46] sisters for God so loved the world that
[6:49] he gave his only begotten son amen that
[6:54] whosoever believeth on him should not
[6:57] perish but have everlasting lasting life
[7:01] let's just bow one more
[7:03] time gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[7:05] thankful that you are the same yesterday

[7:14] Manger we're not looking for a baby
[7:17] we're not looking for a a a young child
[7:20] we're looking for the literal person of
[7:23] Jesus Christ Living out through us and
[7:26] father we pray that Lord as these wise
[7:29] men they were wise how they searched
[7:32] diligently to find that child we pray
[7:36] that Lord Jesus we would SE search
[7:38] diligently to find your very life living
[7:41] out through US Lord and father I pray
[7:44] that each and every one of us would not
[7:46] stop until we see your very life living
[7:49] out through US Lord as we go forwards we
[7:52] just Commit This service into your hands

[8:40] Christmas Eve we know the whole world is
[8:43] running to and
[8:44] fro up and down in the earth looking to
[8:47] see what they can buy scrolling up and
[8:49] down in the phone apps and tablets and
[8:51] computers and spending spending spending
[8:55] we know Christmas has become something
[8:57] completely commercialized and uh uh it's
[9:00] it's amazing when you see the way the
[9:01] world is gone but we're certainly
[9:04] thankful because we've been given the
[9:05] ability to desire the sincere milk of
[9:09] the word to desire the word for our day
[9:12] and that is something uh Beyond Compare
[9:15] we could never go out and buy the desire
[9:18] to find the Lord Jesus Christ we could
[9:21] never just order up a little bit of
[9:23] Faith it's the Lord himself that has
[9:27] descended with a shout amen and you know
[9:30] uh this morning we we're going to have a
[9:31] real special service today I was just
[9:34] ecstatic when I heard that we actually
[9:36] are going to have a baptism after
[9:38] service so I apologize for anyone that
[9:41] has a turkey in the oven today if
[9:43] anybody's got a ham or whatever um
[9:46] you're more than welcome to go early if
[9:47] you need to go because of that or we can
[9:50] uh we can just put it on hold you know
[9:53] there's no no reason why if there is
[9:55] something going on like that we can't
[9:57] just whisper a prayer and ask the Lord
[9:59] to save our meal can pretty much
[10:01] guarantee you he will because this is
[10:03] for the right purpose brothers and
[10:04] sisters right it is yeah we're excited
[10:07] to see what the Lord wants to do anytime
[10:09] somebody wants to get baptized it's such
[10:11] a tremendous blessing yes it so we're
[10:14] excited to uh have a baptism after
[10:15] service and then uh and then we'll be
[10:18] able to get on with our our Christmases
[10:20] excuse me a little bit as I adjust um
[10:24] certainly thankful for the uh the
[10:26] concert that we saw on the weekend it
[10:29] was uh it was an amazing show and God
[10:32] bless you brother Toby for having the
[10:33] desire to put that together uh hopefully
[10:36] next year we can find a way to
[10:37] accommodate everyone it just wasn't
[10:40] possible uh this year to accommodate
[10:42] everyone and uh I think there's a
[10:44] recording going to be available I don't
[10:46] think it is yet but uh they're going to
[10:48] edit it and I'm sure that it would be
[10:50] shared with anyone who is interested so
[10:53] um in time I'm sure we'll hear about
[10:57] it um talking about the story today I
[11:00] think it's just a a wonderful story and
[11:03] we heard a little bit about it at the
[11:04] concert and I just was trying to find
[11:07] the mind of the Lord and you know many
[11:08] times I not really interested in trying
[11:11] to preach a Christmas message and I
[11:13] think maybe that's the Lord correcting
[11:16] me a little bit about it but maybe I
[11:18] should be a little bit more on Trend
[11:21] maybe I should want to preach uh
[11:23] Christmas Story and I just got thinking
[11:25] about it today you know how important it
[11:27] is to to recognize that God sends gifts
[11:30] and and they always find their place
[11:33] always they don't sometimes or or most
[11:36] of the time God's gifts always always
[11:39] always find their place am and uh you
[11:42] know brother Brandon preaches this
[11:43] message God's gifts always find their
[11:45] places I'll I'll probably preach the
[11:48] majority from that message and and I
[11:50] just think it's it's a wonderful thing
[11:53] looking at this uh this idea of
[11:56] Christmas and you know how we have
[11:59] Christmas celebrated in the world many
[12:01] different ways but it it's become a big
[12:03] commercialized deal and you know I I
[12:06] think I heard it said before and you
[12:08] probably have as well how you could do a
[12:10] survey now and and ask what the meaning
[12:13] of Christmas is we were once again we
[12:16] were just driving in the car and you
[12:18] know we we didn't have the message going
[12:20] I apologize it was the Billy Graham
[12:22] Station again and you know when you
[12:24] listen to that man preach if you have
[12:26] the understanding and the Insight that
[12:28] he was one of the two angels sent down
[12:31] to Sodom to preach to Blind them when
[12:35] you hear that man Minister if you
[12:37] haven't heard him I would strongly
[12:38] recommend just listen under the the
[12:41] light of of the message of the hour and
[12:43] hear what he has to say and he was
[12:45] talking and and under his anointing that
[12:48] man could preach and and he really
[12:51] spelled it out how talking about
[12:54] Christmas how you could do a survey and
[12:57] and there's children everywhere that
[12:59] that were given what what what what does
[13:01] Christmas mean to you and I think they
[13:03] asked maybe 50 kids and out of 50
[13:06] children not one of them said Jesus
[13:09] Christ this was back in 1990 I think it
[13:13] was that he he ministered I could be
[13:15] wrong maybe it was in 80 I I can't
[13:18] remember the date specifically but it
[13:19] was quite a while ago but still to think
[13:22] about it you know even if it was 20
[13:24] years ago 30 years ago back then not one
[13:27] child out of 50 could say the name Jesus
[13:31] it was gifts it was cards it was music
[13:33] it was carols it was Santa it was all
[13:37] these different things I wonder how much
[13:39] farther down the road are we brothers
[13:41] and sisters we were having a
[13:43] conversation a at at a dinner table
[13:45] speaking about the word of God you know
[13:47] and it's an invisible Union of the Bride
[13:49] of Jesus Christ today that's what's
[13:51] going on with the message of the hour
[13:53] the further we go down the road having
[13:55] the ability to believe this word the
[13:57] more united we become with with our our
[13:59] bridegroom and you know at the same time
[14:02] the rest of the world isn't just sitting
[14:03] by Idol what's happening is they're
[14:05] becoming United with their bridegroom
[14:07] also both things are happening at the
[14:09] exact same time and that's why we say it
[14:12] again and again brothers and sisters
[14:14] outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:16] you will be United with the wrong head
[14:19] the wrong headship the wrong bridegroom
[14:22] but when you get baptized with the Holy
[14:24] Ghost in your life by Jesus Christ
[14:26] himself then you're sealed till the day
[14:28] of your Redemption you will not have to
[14:31] go unto the mark of the beast because we
[14:34] know full well to reject the baptism of
[14:36] the holy spirit is to receive the mark
[14:39] of the beast don't look for a day where
[14:42] you're going to see something in the
[14:43] back of your hand or something in your
[14:45] forehead because we know that brother
[14:47] bradam said it very clearly the back of
[14:49] the hand spiritually speaking is your
[14:51] action and in the forehead is the
[14:54] thought so the mark of the beast is to
[14:56] resist the Holy Ghost and to actually
[14:58] have a thought to resist and to move
[15:00] your hand to act upon that resistance
[15:03] thought that's the mark of the beast
[15:06] it's a spiritual Mark brothers and
[15:08] sisters it's not
[15:10] covid it's not a vaccine it doesn't
[15:14] matter what Bill Gates tries to do it's
[15:17] irrelevant God's going to do what God
[15:19] wants done and he sent a prophet to say
[15:22] what the mark of the beast
[15:25] is and you know we're already in that
[15:27] hybrid condition we talked about this a
[15:29] little while ago hear people say oh
[15:31] they're serpent seed you know what
[15:33] brothers and sisters outside of the
[15:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost so are
[15:36] you because you're still hybrid just
[15:39] like them there's one difference one can
[15:42] actually receive the word of God for
[15:44] their day and the other one can't that's
[15:46] the only difference but for the grace of
[15:49] God there go
[15:50] I that's why it's so incredibly
[15:54] important and I'll never stop preaching
[15:55] it until the day that I I die or I go in
[15:58] the sky whichever it is you got to get
[16:00] the Holy Ghost and I think it's so
[16:02] tremendous that Brother Andy sarpong not
[16:05] Brother Andy brother Benny sarpong today
[16:08] brother Andy has been baptized brother
[16:10] Benny sarpong has asked to be baptized
[16:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[16:15] we know that he knows
[16:18] why sorry Brothers it's not about
[16:22] conforming to a church standard it's
[16:26] understanding that there's more to this
[16:27] than just a Church standard than saying
[16:30] that I've got a a message believing
[16:32] household and that's where I live that's
[16:34] where I come from I know the seals I
[16:36] know all the messages and the Mysteries
[16:38] it's not about that at all it's about
[16:40] getting the true baptism of the Holy
[16:41] Ghost and you know those people that
[16:44] have it they're the ones that are saying
[16:45] amen and I just pray that everyone else
[16:47] would get to that place where we would
[16:49] all say Amen truly that's what we need
[16:54] that's the Christmas message brothers
[16:55] and sisters that's the reason why he
[16:57] came so that he could be raised up and
[17:00] be tempted in like manner in all points
[17:03] just like the rest of us but then lay
[17:05] his life down for all of his friends
[17:08] than but before he did that what did he
[17:10] do in the garden he asked the father can
[17:12] I just have them for Fellowship can can
[17:15] we just have Fellowship that's what we
[17:16] want we really want to be together in
[17:18] the end and and you know then he laid
[17:21] his life down and and and he was risen
[17:24] again and we know that he gave gifts
[17:26] unto men he came back and he L himself
[17:29] upon the church in clothing tongues of
[17:31] fire and we know that we got a prophet
[17:33] in our age that said that was actually
[17:35] the pillar of fire came down and divided
[17:37] himself amongst the church so that every
[17:39] single one of the people that could call
[17:41] upon the name of Jesus Christ could have
[17:43] their own pillar of fire
[17:48] experience sorry I'm getting a little
[17:49] excited about this but I just think it's
[17:51] beautiful I just want to I just want to
[17:53] go into uh you know brother bradam
[17:55] talking about this and you know a little
[17:56] bit about Christmas we we live live in a
[17:58] a world that's very commercialized and
[18:01] we can we can get caught up in it one
[18:03] way or the other we can go extremely far
[18:06] in one side and extremely far on the
[18:07] other side and brothers and sisters we
[18:09] just need to go right down the middle of
[18:11] the road trusting that the Lord will
[18:13] give us the way of Holiness we preached
[18:15] it a while ago you know there's a
[18:16] highway but there is also a way that is
[18:20] a way of Holiness and get the Holy Ghost
[18:23] and he'll show you that way don't ask
[18:26] someone to tell you what that way is
[18:28] because I guarantee you if you rely upon
[18:30] a man or you rely upon your own
[18:32] instincts those senses remember we said
[18:35] that last Sunday we preached before
[18:36] brother codre was here those five senses
[18:38] will
[18:39] lie because they'll never all the time
[18:42] go in line with the word of God there
[18:44] will be times where they will actually
[18:46] deviate from the word of God and that's
[18:47] where we've got to Reign it in and say
[18:49] nope be it unto me according to Thy
[18:52] word brother brandom out of God's Gift
[18:55] always find their places he says see and
[18:58] I know them I know the but I'm looking
[19:01] back on my life and I wonder where it
[19:04] happened from them first little
[19:07] Christmases when we hang up our
[19:09] stockings and and Mama would get we'd
[19:11] probably get an orange
[19:13] and two or three little pieces of
[19:16] striped candy and that was a great
[19:18] Christmas to us amen but you know kids
[19:23] they look forward to them
[19:25] gifts we find out that Christmas is
[19:28] mainly to the children they look forward
[19:31] to it
[19:33] nowadays it's it's turned off to the
[19:37] children but it really should be adults
[19:41] it should be teaching children what real
[19:44] Christmas is amen and I totally do not
[19:47] believe that that Christ could be born
[19:49] on the 25th day of December in Judea cuz
[19:53] it's colder than it is right now here
[19:56] see oh and how could the the Shepherds
[19:58] be keeping their flocks by night then
[20:01] the Taxation and everything and Mary
[20:03] having to come that far from excuse me
[20:06] way down in Bethlehem up into
[20:09] Judea excuse me up into Jerusalem rather
[20:12] for the taxation I could could I hardly
[20:16] could believe that come up believe she
[20:20] come to Nazareth and so when how that
[20:23] would could be done it could not be done
[20:27] but I believe that Christ was born in in
[20:30] spring because in every way he was a
[20:33] lamb see you notice he was born in a
[20:36] barn and not in the
[20:37] house and when they took him to the
[20:39] cross the others as far as we know that
[20:43] he never said about him leading them but
[20:47] they led
[20:48] him did you know a lamb or a sheep has
[20:51] to be led to the slaughter it will not
[20:54] go to the slaughter you have to lead it
[20:56] there and usually it's a goat that lead
[20:58] leads the Sheep In The Killing pens they
[21:01] have a goat and the Goat will walk up
[21:02] this Runway till he gets up to the Sheep
[21:05] started down the runway to be killed and
[21:07] then the goat will jump out but when
[21:09] they come a time they're going to kill a
[21:12] goat he really kicks up a fuss he has to
[21:14] go in but of course you couldn't blame
[21:16] him amen but it's a thing how a sheep
[21:20] has to be led and he was led to the
[21:24] slaughter they led him he was a lamb and
[21:28] we know I'm going to throw this in there
[21:29] that the word says that he was dumb as a
[21:32] lamb before his shears it didn't say a
[21:33] word he had tremendous opportunity to
[21:36] say a word and the only thing he did say
[21:38] when he was before Pilate when he said
[21:40] are you a king don't you know who I am
[21:43] I've got the power to take your life and
[21:44] lay it down he said you don't have any
[21:46] power at all except for my father gives
[21:47] it to you but hey you said
[21:50] it brother bradam he goes on to say and
[21:52] I believe in that way being altogether
[21:56] nature and Lambs are born in March April
[21:59] and somewhere along in there not later
[22:01] than May and I don't believe it was
[22:03] anything before March and anything after
[22:05] May sometime along in there but when the
[22:09] church Christianity was married into
[22:13] romanism was at the NAA
[22:15] Council when they accepted the Roman
[22:19] Nation accepted Christianity and made
[22:22] what they called the universal religion
[22:25] was
[22:26] Christianity they made made the
[22:28] universal religion and they worshiped
[22:32] idols and they had a sun
[22:36] god and right now from the 21st to the
[22:40] 25th the sun almost stands in its same
[22:43] track as it's
[22:45] passing what is it you call that I bean
[22:49] I thought I knew it but I can't think of
[22:51] it the sun it gains so much and loses so
[22:54] much it's the solstice I'm throwing it
[22:56] in there until the 20
[22:58] being the 21st and the 25th of December
[23:01] oh I forget what they call it what
[23:03] someone says Eclipse no eclipse is when
[23:05] it passes the Sun and Moon passes
[23:08] together it's something in there I can
[23:09] almost say it but I can't now however
[23:12] it's that standstill of the sun which is
[23:15] called by the Romans that's when the
[23:18] circus went on it's called the son God's
[23:21] birthday they celebrated it from the
[23:24] 21st to the 25th of December so then
[23:29] being that this was converted Rome into
[23:32] Christianity was accepted in their way
[23:35] in Rome then they said we'll make the
[23:38] same celebration and make the son of
[23:41] God's birthday see the son God Jupiter's
[23:44] birthday then son of God's birthday 25th
[23:48] of
[23:50] December but what difference does it
[23:53] make I love how he brings it back to
[23:55] Center what difference does it make
[23:57] brothers and sisters see today when we
[24:00] are even if it's if it's uh if they was
[24:04] doing it in July or August or whenever
[24:07] it might be it's still the sacredness of
[24:10] remembering that God gave us the hope
[24:13] that we have in US
[24:16] amen so I just want to say this brothers
[24:18] and sisters I know I've heard it in
[24:20] varying degrees that oh if you say Merry
[24:22] Christmas whoa you shouldn't say that
[24:24] because we believe the message of the
[24:25] hour you know what brother Bram said it
[24:28] many times even after the seals were
[24:30] open he said Merry Christmas I'm not
[24:32] here to try and tell you what you should
[24:34] or you shouldn't do except for one thing
[24:36] that you should do get the Holy Ghost
[24:39] let the Holy Ghost Lead You In what you
[24:41] should do and what you should say and
[24:43] see what he says about it and you know
[24:46] if you ask him is this appropriate Lord
[24:49] he'll tell you exactly he'll let you
[24:52] know whether it's appropriate or
[24:54] not but Christmas happened yes
[24:58] Christmas actually happened Jesus was
[25:00] actually born in flesh Jesus was God in
[25:04] flesh the Creator in flesh because
[25:07] outside of God's blood where would we be
[25:12] we would be
[25:13] lost but what difference does it make he
[25:16] said see today even if they was doing it
[25:19] in July or August or whatever it might
[25:21] be it's still the sacredness of
[25:22] remembering that God gave us the hope
[25:26] that we have in us and now you say well
[25:29] the rest of them's all Santa Claus and
[25:31] going on like they do why we just might
[25:33] as well do it he says it no sir no this
[25:37] is not a pagan celebration to us this is
[25:41] a sacred
[25:43] hour if there had been no Christmas
[25:46] there would be no
[25:48] Resurrection if there had been no
[25:50] Christmas there'd be no love if there'd
[25:53] be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for
[25:56] the believer
[25:58] if there had been no Christmas
[26:01] am and now you say well the rest of the
[26:05] world they just well see the fork
[26:08] lightning and the black Cloudy Skies
[26:10] show that there can be light in a time
[26:11] of
[26:13] Darkness I just love the way that he
[26:15] says this brothers and sisters it's so
[26:16] important for us I believe to just maybe
[26:19] listen to it and and take it in and just
[26:21] hear what he says the whole context of
[26:24] it these lights tonight prove that there
[26:27] can be light in a time of
[26:30] darkness and when does light shine best
[26:33] in
[26:34] darkness you turn these lights on in
[26:36] daytime and the sun is shining you'll
[26:38] hardly notice they're on but just
[26:42] once just one little we light will shine
[26:46] real bright in a time of darkness and
[26:49] right now is the darkest when every
[26:50] Christian should give a testimony of the
[26:53] hope that's in him of Jesus Christ the
[26:56] son of God
[26:59] shines light shines the brightest when
[27:01] it's the most dark brothers and sisters
[27:04] we can see this world is commercialized
[27:05] all around us many people would say
[27:08] Christmas is a real dark time and you
[27:10] know I've said it from the pulpit which
[27:12] which is worse Halloween or Christmas
[27:15] and and I think it's maybe a shocker to
[27:17] say it but what's the spirit behind each
[27:19] one brothers and sisters right are we
[27:22] actually celebrating Christ Jesus the
[27:25] birth of Christ Jesus in our hearts as
[27:27] our brother prayed earlier today is it
[27:29] truly a personal relationship with Jesus
[27:32] Christ in our lives or is it just a
[27:35] celebration it's a good
[27:37] turkey my goodness we're going to have a
[27:39] real good turkey it's an organically
[27:42] grown turkey and we're going to have the
[27:43] best of the vegetables and you know
[27:46] we've got some gifts and I just can't
[27:47] wait to give these special gifts that I
[27:49] bought for everyone and you know is that
[27:51] what Christmas is or is it actually a
[27:54] time to reflect that none of this would
[27:56] be happening had we not had a birth of
[27:58] Jesus Christ
[28:02] Hallelujah am right there has to be a
[28:06] testimony of the
[28:08] hope hope that's in him life of a
[28:11] believer of Jesus Christ the son of God
[28:14] brother Bram says not some Chris kingle
[28:15] that was born back Yonder you know and
[28:18] some kind of a lit tree up and went down
[28:20] through the forest one night some
[28:22] fiction story that there's no bottom to
[28:25] it but we believe solid L on the
[28:28] promised word of a coming Messiah and he
[28:31] was born on Christmas
[28:34] day 20 pretty near 2,000 years ago we
[28:39] believe brother Bram talks about it in
[28:41] in the message of the hour how important
[28:43] it is to not lie to our
[28:45] children we don't want to lie to our
[28:47] children brothers and sisters and tell
[28:49] them that there's a criss cringle or
[28:51] that there's a Santa Claus we want to
[28:53] tell our children that there's Jesus
[28:55] Christ am and tell our children that
[28:58] there is a Santa it's a fable sure
[29:01] there's a Santa everybody talks about
[29:03] Santa you see pictures of Santa
[29:05] everywhere but he's not
[29:07] real he doesn't come down the chimney
[29:10] with a bunch of presents and give them
[29:12] to the children that's not what happens
[29:15] we give gifts to one another in
[29:17] remembrance of the gift that was
[29:19] actually given to us that's the purpose
[29:21] of giving gifts some people take it to
[29:23] the extreme and it's tremendous amounts
[29:25] of gifts and other people won't recogn
[29:27] ize it at all and not give their
[29:29] children even a piece of candy for
[29:30] Christmas brothers and sisters there's
[29:32] got to be a balance somewhere there's
[29:34] got to be a middle of the road for it
[29:38] amen I think it's beautiful how we've
[29:41] been given a prophet he's he's given us
[29:43] a real perspective that that's that's I
[29:46] want to say down
[29:48] home it's not Pious High in the sky and
[29:51] and and making the families feel so
[29:54] uncomfortable that they really wonder
[29:56] the children Wonder do I want to serve
[29:58] this God because it's so weird and and
[30:01] and and uncomfortable but then it's not
[30:04] the other side where we just we just put
[30:07] a Christmas tree on the stage of our
[30:09] church
[30:11] right we recognize it's Jesus Christ the
[30:15] same yesterday today and forever the
[30:18] Holy Ghost himself you know the last
[30:20] time we preached we talked about faith
[30:22] and I just want to put this in there I'm
[30:24] not done with it I I really deviated I
[30:27] was going to go this way but felt led to
[30:29] go this way with the Christmas story
[30:32] today but uh you know we want to talk
[30:34] about faith brothers and sisters Faith
[30:36] needs to be preached and and it's not
[30:39] just a first or second pole faith that
[30:41] I'm talking about brothers and sisters
[30:42] we're talking about third pole faith and
[30:45] that third pole Faith isn't just to
[30:47] create things and to have an existence
[30:49] and and to satisfy the the lust of our
[30:52] flesh I've got a hungry stomach so I
[30:53] need to speak some food into existence
[30:55] maybe there'll come a time where that
[30:57] will just manifest but what we're
[30:59] talking about today brothers and sisters
[31:01] is to have rapturing faith in our lives
[31:03] because without faith in our lives it's
[31:06] impossible to please God I do not want
[31:09] to deviate from that thought we're going
[31:10] to go that direction in the future it is
[31:13] impossible to please him we know that
[31:15] Enoch had that testimony before he was
[31:17] translated and that was that he pleased
[31:20] God how do we please God brothers and
[31:22] sisters how do we please God I want to
[31:25] just put that in there in our hearts in
[31:27] our Minds that maybe we can just ponder
[31:29] it while we have time in fellowship with
[31:31] our family and our friends over the
[31:32] Christmas holidays how do we please God
[31:36] is it just coming to church is it
[31:37] knowing the message of the hour is it
[31:40] saying that God sent a prophet or is it
[31:42] actually demonstrating through the very
[31:44] lives that we live
[31:46] [Music]
[31:48] Hallelujah without faith it's impossible
[31:50] to please
[31:51] him right and I just believe that
[31:53] everyone that believes has the ability
[31:56] to have that Tes testimony and then
[31:57] every once in a while we'll actually
[31:59] have to give a word or two to actually
[32:01] go along with that
[32:03] testimony we talked about the senses
[32:05] last time as well to go along with that
[32:07] faith and our senses can only get in the
[32:09] way we know that we've been given our
[32:11] senses to contact this world and it's
[32:14] important to recognize that we can we
[32:16] can we can be so Heavenly minded
[32:19] brothers and sisters that we're not any
[32:21] Earthly good that's amen we live in this
[32:25] world we've got to pay our taxes we've
[32:28] got to go to work we got to provide for
[32:30] our families or we're worse than an
[32:32] Infidel is what the word of God says we
[32:34] have to be willing to just follow the
[32:36] basic things in this life we've got to
[32:39] be willing to do that but you know what
[32:41] when when we do all of that something
[32:44] Supernatural happens God blesses us
[32:47] because we're marching forward by
[32:49] faith we can't just say that God's going
[32:52] to bless me and I'm going to do nothing
[32:53] for it that's not the way it works every
[32:56] single day Israel when they went into
[32:58] the promised land they had to get out of
[33:00] bed get out of their tents March and get
[33:03] inform formed and stand still and watch
[33:05] the glory of the Lord he didn't say just
[33:08] stay in your just stay in your tent
[33:10] don't worry about it just relax just
[33:11] take the day off and I'll go fight the
[33:13] battles for you that's not the way it
[33:16] worked everyone had to March everyone
[33:19] had to do their part amen everyone was a
[33:21] part of
[33:23] it getting into our story today I really
[33:27] didn't want to be too long I'm so sorry
[33:29] I'll try and just get going here you
[33:32] know talking about our story I think
[33:33] it's beautiful um if you look at the the
[33:35] the story and and how the three kings
[33:38] they they came to to Jerusalem they were
[33:41] looking for this baby these these three
[33:43] kings the wise men the the Magi these
[33:47] these men the Bible says that there were
[33:49] three and and we heard it at the concert
[33:51] that it it's it's so good I believe
[33:53] brother John said it really well that
[33:55] you know the Bible doesn't say there was
[33:57] three there was three gifts that were
[33:59] given that's what the Bible says a and
[34:02] tradition has taken and made it three
[34:04] kings we know there's songs written
[34:06] about it and it's not necessarily three
[34:09] it's three gifts that were given to the
[34:12] baby and and I'll back up on that one
[34:14] too because we know that by this time it
[34:17] wasn't a baby the prophet for our day
[34:20] said you can read the word of God and I
[34:22] I went and call it fact checked it I had
[34:24] to dig it up and and look it up in in
[34:26] the scripture a little further ahead and
[34:28] we know that the Bible refers to the
[34:30] baby as the
[34:31] baby but here we have a young child the
[34:34] word of God says in the scripture that
[34:36] we read that Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[34:39] of Judea in the days of Herod they they
[34:42] they came looking for the king of the
[34:44] Jews a and and you know it's verse 11
[34:48] and when they were come into the house
[34:51] they saw the young child with Mary his
[34:54] mother and fell down and worship him
[34:57] they didn't come to a stable with a
[35:00] Manger of hay they came to a house
[35:04] that's what the word said they came to
[35:06] the house and they found the child and
[35:08] we know that Herod he caught wind that
[35:10] this was happening and what did he do
[35:11] Herod was a lunatic he was he was a
[35:14] puppet that was set up by Rome to say
[35:16] that you need a king you better have a
[35:18] king you can be the king but you better
[35:19] do exactly what we tell you a and so
[35:22] here he was this mad man and what did he
[35:24] say he decreed that somebody else was
[35:26] going to be the king the Jews how could
[35:27] that be Mr insecurity what did he do he
[35:30] made a decree that everyone two years
[35:31] old and younger will just Slaughter him
[35:33] just get rid of them do away with them
[35:35] perfect plan
[35:37] right we know the angel of the Lord came
[35:39] to them in a dream and said you know
[35:41] what Joseph it's time to get up and get
[35:43] your wife and that child out of here you
[35:46] get them and you protect them get them
[35:48] out of the land because we know that
[35:50] herod's going to do this terrible
[35:52] deed but but we we just look at this and
[35:54] and I just want to try and hit the
[35:56] highlights right right there and and I'm
[35:57] just going to read a bunch of quotes
[35:58] today out of this message and and why
[36:02] Jesus had to come to Bethlehem you know
[36:04] continuing on with this uh paragraph 29
[36:08] I don't know if it comes up that way and
[36:09] Christ is our
[36:11] Bethlehem and could prove that every man
[36:15] that's born of God is born in Bethlehem
[36:18] have you been born in
[36:20] Bethlehem how can that be brothers and
[36:22] sisters we look at that and say here we
[36:24] have the prophet of God saying everyone
[36:25] that's been born of God has been born in
[36:28] Bethlehem I was born in cla's home
[36:30] Alberta how could that
[36:32] be he goes on to say it and that's what
[36:35] he was the bread of life and Beth Beth
[36:40] means house and L is God and elhem is
[36:45] elhem which means bread and House of
[36:49] God's bread and Jesus Christ was the
[36:52] house of God's bread bread of eternal
[36:55] life
[36:57] and we know that that's what Jesus
[36:58] declared isn't it I am the bread that's
[37:01] come down from
[37:04] heaven and every man that's borned into
[37:07] Christ you're borned into Bethlehem
[37:10] God's house of bread and how that the
[37:12] leagues of these churches today is
[37:15] Garrison like the Philistines to keep
[37:18] the people from it and we know that the
[37:21] the Philistines were garrisoned out
[37:23] around Bethlehem and the Shepherds they
[37:26] kept their watch they the the whole
[37:28] story is in there brother bradam he
[37:30] talks about it why why it it had to be
[37:33] Bethlehem there's a few different
[37:35] messages and uh the story is really good
[37:38] I don't want to go too far that way with
[37:39] it I want to talk about the wise men and
[37:41] and their gifts and and how God's gifts
[37:44] they always find their places and you
[37:47] know I just think this is such a
[37:49] wonderful thing this this quote just
[37:51] jumped out at me as I was studying this
[37:53] and brother brandham he says that God
[37:57] God can use every single faculty of our
[38:00] being Hallelujah every single faculty of
[38:04] our
[38:05] being we can try and use every single
[38:08] faculty of our being and we can be
[38:11] misled I can have an emotion I can have
[38:15] a memory I can have my own
[38:18] reasoning I I could have my own fear I
[38:21] could have my own doubt I could have all
[38:23] these different things happening inside
[38:25] of me and and if I try and do it
[38:27] brothers and sisters it won't turn out
[38:29] right as human beings it won't turn out
[38:31] right brother bradam he says what does
[38:34] it teach us right here before we hit our
[38:37] text here's what it teaches us that God
[38:40] can use every faculty or being if it's
[38:45] committed surrendered unto him
[38:47] hallelujah amen he can use our
[38:51] mind he can use our dreams and just I'll
[38:54] throw this in there for time sake I know
[38:55] I've got a lot of quotes today from this
[38:57] message but brother Bram is talking
[38:59] specifically here about the dreams you
[39:00] can go back and listen to it or or read
[39:02] it if you'd like to but how the angel
[39:04] came and said Joseph take your wife and
[39:06] get out of the land in a dream and
[39:09] brother Bram says that dreams are
[39:10] secondary and we need to make sure that
[39:11] we just hit that point to dreams are
[39:14] secondary God will speak to us through a
[39:15] dream but it will always be in line with
[39:17] the word of God and it will always come
[39:19] to pass and if it doesn't come to pass
[39:20] and it's not in line with the word of
[39:22] God then just leave it alone brothers
[39:24] and sisters we have a lot of Dreams in
[39:26] our
[39:27] lives but this is what brother bam is
[39:29] talking about God will use any single
[39:31] faculty of Our Lives don't ever doubt it
[39:33] for a second that God can use every
[39:36] faculty of our being if it's committed
[39:38] surrendered unto him he can use your
[39:39] mind our dreams our subconscious our
[39:43] first conscious our tongue our songs our
[39:46] eyes our everything that we have can be
[39:50] used of God if it's committed to God see
[39:53] I think that's so beautiful that that
[39:55] means let's just just talk about the one
[39:57] thing he said we can see if we commit it
[40:00] to God we can actually have God use that
[40:03] faculty in our lives we can look at
[40:05] someone and say oh I see they're not
[40:07] living right for God you know what
[40:09] brothers and sisters the maturity of the
[40:11] Holy Ghost In Our Lives is going to give
[40:13] us the ability to say that's not what I
[40:15] see though because I'm not looking
[40:17] through my eyes I'm looking through the
[40:19] faculty of the Holy Ghost at that person
[40:21] and you know what maybe their children
[40:23] aren't living for the Lord today but
[40:25] what is that to me that's not the seed
[40:27] Gene of God God put a seed in their
[40:30] life and it's such a beautiful thing
[40:32] because that's what I see I see the life
[40:35] of Jesus Christ Living out through that
[40:37] child living out through that wife
[40:40] living out through that husband living
[40:41] out through that mother that father that
[40:44] brother that sister God Amen we have the
[40:47] ability to do that am I want to actually
[40:51] back up on that God has the ability to
[40:53] do that on our own we'll never be able
[40:56] to to do
[40:57] that but boy oh boy when we become a
[41:01] spiritual giant with the Holy Ghost In
[41:02] Our Lives we get a lot of Grace for
[41:06] people right amen because we recognize
[41:09] that if we didn't have his grace Amen in
[41:11] our lives where would we
[41:13] be how could we ever be who we are
[41:16] without having his grace law that's not
[41:19] going to do a thing for us especially
[41:22] for our children children are pretty
[41:24] smart I've said it for years they're
[41:26] smart they can see when someone's a
[41:28] legalist when they live with my dos and
[41:31] don'ts that's what it is children get
[41:33] fed up with that and they say why would
[41:35] we be different people at church than we
[41:36] are at home why wouldn't we just live
[41:38] our lives eat and drink today for
[41:41] tomorrow we just die there's no life to
[41:43] the message of the hour but boy oh boy
[41:46] when children see their parents have
[41:48] true humility the humility of Jesus
[41:50] Christ in their lives when their parents
[41:52] can come to them and say hey I was wrong
[41:57] will you forgive me when children see
[42:00] that kind of a life it's not a normal
[42:02] human life the normal human life says no
[42:05] way I'm dead I've got the pride of life
[42:08] and I know exactly all about it all and
[42:11] what I say goes and nobody can deviate
[42:13] from that
[42:15] okay that's not the way that we want God
[42:17] to deal with us though is it and boy you
[42:20] know I I just have to hit on this I'm
[42:22] sorry but I I I'm going to talk about it
[42:24] in the future we're not going to get
[42:25] away from it when brother Cadre was
[42:27] talking about it can you believe that
[42:28] there's wives afraid of their husbands
[42:30] in the message of the hour is that even
[42:34] possible brothers and sisters I don't
[42:37] know I believe that was a spirit of God
[42:38] Discerning something here and I want to
[42:40] say this if we as a husband have created
[42:44] fear in the lives of our wives That's
[42:46] not the spirit of Jesus Christ Living
[42:48] out through you
[42:50] brother that's not the spirit of Christ
[42:53] because the spirit of Christ doesn't
[42:54] rule by fear amen he Rules by
[42:58] love and which one of us as the Bride of
[43:01] Jesus Christ would want to live in fear
[43:03] of our
[43:05] husband my for me I I I just about hit
[43:08] the floor when I heard that I thought
[43:09] goodness
[43:10] sakes wives afraid of their
[43:14] husbands Lord have
[43:16] mercy if we can submit ourselves
[43:20] everything that we have can be used of
[43:23] God if it's committed to God see
[43:25] everything that you are commit it to God
[43:28] young people today I want to say it
[43:30] everything that you are commit it to God
[43:33] he'll use every outlet and every part of
[43:36] you he'll use it no matter what it is
[43:38] he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his
[43:41] purpose and calling
[43:44] amen and you old people
[43:48] too give it to the Lord amen let the
[43:51] Lord have the gift let let let let the
[43:53] gift find its place amen and God will
[43:56] use it
[43:58] tremendously and you know brother bam he
[44:00] says it he goes on to say it here in
[44:01] paragraph 44 here there's only one gift
[44:04] that you can give and that is
[44:06] yourself give yourself to God because
[44:09] God's already give you his gift now
[44:12] there's only one thing you owe back to
[44:14] God that's yourself to
[44:17] him Hallelujah I think it's so
[44:20] beautiful you know talking about this
[44:24] story The the Christmas Story the birth
[44:27] of
[44:28] Jesus we know that the Holy Ghost came
[44:31] and and and overpowered shouldn't say
[44:34] overpowered overshadowed Mary amen and
[44:37] and she was found with child of the Holy
[44:40] Ghost and and what was it that happened
[44:43] in in that that meeting that happened
[44:45] between her and Gabriel the Angel
[44:47] messenger for her day he he brought a
[44:50] message to her and said thou highly
[44:54] favored amongst women
[44:56] and the only thing that she did was give
[44:59] herself back to that angel and said you
[45:01] know what I don't understand this but
[45:03] hey I know that someone's supposed to
[45:05] fulfill the scripture so be it unto me
[45:07] according to Thy word amen behold the
[45:09] handmade of the Lord and what happened
[45:11] we know in that moment the Holy Ghost
[45:14] overshadowed her and conception happened
[45:16] and we talked about it in the past and I
[45:18] just want to say it today brothers and
[45:19] sisters let that spiritual conception
[45:21] happen in our lives just commit
[45:23] ourselves to him maybe we don't
[45:25] understand some of the stuff we hear
[45:26] about the message of the hour but just
[45:28] surrender yourself unto him commit
[45:30] yourself unto him and just see if he
[45:32] won't use that gift amen we know that
[45:35] the word of God says to uh humble
[45:38] ourselves in in in what in the sight of
[45:41] the Lord amen and he will lift you up
[45:44] amen so I want to say this today
[45:46] brothers and sisters where's God's eyes
[45:49] today are they just off in heaven
[45:51] somewhere in another
[45:52] dimension are they in a church somewhere
[45:55] I'll say it they're in your brother and
[45:57] they're in your sister they're in your
[46:00] mother and your
[46:01] father they're in your husband they're
[46:03] in your wife those are the eyes of God
[46:06] humble yourself in the sight of the Lord
[46:08] brothers and sisters and see if he won't
[46:10] lift you up guarantee you he will you
[46:14] know we talked about this uh earlier
[46:16] they didn't find a baby in the manger in
[46:18] paragraph 48 I need to keep going here
[46:20] brother Bram he says now watch God what
[46:22] a strange thing it is tonight to see
[46:24] that these men Magis learned men Great
[46:28] Men coming down from the East that was
[46:30] Babylon which was India and they never
[46:33] come in any all night and and started
[46:36] one night and just got there the next
[46:39] they were about two years getting
[46:42] there this was something that was
[46:44] happening and as I was studying this I
[46:46] just many times we hear it and and and I
[46:48] know it can just sometimes be common to
[46:51] us but I I don't ever want it to just
[46:53] get common to me brothers and sisters
[46:54] and I pray that it won't for you either
[46:56] but I just was thinking about it how
[46:57] brother Bram talked about them seeing
[46:59] that light and nobody else could see
[47:01] that light and you know we've been given
[47:04] the ability to see a light we talked
[47:07] about it before you know that that
[47:08] Supernatural picture that was taken that
[47:11] you know JC Lacy I think it is he's the
[47:13] one that that verified that it was
[47:15] actually the first photograph
[47:17] Supernatural photo and and it even hangs
[47:20] in the Hall of Fame in Washington DC
[47:22] today it's an actual picture it's not
[47:24] just a story but there are Supernatural
[47:27] lights that people can see when God
[47:29] wants you to amen and just to throw it
[47:33] out there we know that Billy Paul he got
[47:35] the chance to see the angel but after
[47:37] the angel left there was a supernatural
[47:39] light in the color of a rainbow in the
[47:41] corner of the
[47:42] room we can see Supernatural lights but
[47:45] anyways these Magi and and they never
[47:47] come in any all night and started one
[47:49] night and got in there the next two they
[47:51] were about two years getting there they
[47:54] never come to a little baby in a Manger
[47:56] they come to a young child a young child
[47:58] and Herod killed the children from 2
[48:01] years old see to know that wasn't a
[48:03] little infant lying in a cradle he'd
[48:06] just kill all the infants but he killed
[48:09] the young children so that he'd be sure
[48:11] to get
[48:14] them I just think it's beautiful when
[48:16] you think about this sometimes it can
[48:19] just become common like I said you know
[48:21] the baby the manger the wise men all
[48:24] this but here we have the prophet of God
[48:26] setting it straight saying this is what
[48:28] happened and and he killed the young
[48:31] children so that he'd be sure to get
[48:33] them anywhere from two years old and
[48:35] back he set the time up because knowing
[48:38] he didn't want to kill too many all of
[48:41] them just because they were more like
[48:44] slaves to him remember I said he was a
[48:46] lunatic he was he wanted to get to be
[48:50] sure to get him so he said the kid would
[48:53] be about 2 years old so everything from
[48:56] 2 years old down kill it see and that's
[48:59] brought to pass what the prophet said in
[49:02] Rama they'll they'll be heard a
[49:04] screaming or crying a weeping that
[49:06] Rachel weeping for her children and they
[49:09] were not they were not comforted and you
[49:13] just can't imagine what that would have
[49:14] been like to have that order and to have
[49:18] policemen if we can imagine it today
[49:21] Calgary City police going door too or
[49:23] even the military an occupied military
[49:26] going door too kicking in doors if you
[49:29] don't open the door if you've got
[49:30] children registered in your home they're
[49:32] kicking the door in and they're going to
[49:33] take your child and they're going to
[49:35] kill it if it's two years or
[49:37] younger any boy just can't imagine that
[49:41] what that would have sounded like
[49:44] right but God's gifts always find their
[49:47] places amen God watches out for his own
[49:51] and we know that they were given the
[49:52] direction to be free they didn't have to
[49:55] succumb come to this but that's just the
[49:57] devil's way just try and do a blanket
[50:00] statement and and hope that it sticks
[50:01] somehow right somehow we can just
[50:03] overcome God's will he'll never be able
[50:05] to overcome God's will he's just a very
[50:08] very good tool in the hand of God that's
[50:10] all satan is he has no power except for
[50:13] what God decides to give
[50:17] him I just think it's beautiful here
[50:19] we'll carry on in this story brother bam
[50:21] says now did you notice that these wise
[50:23] men Great Men was up in Babylon and they
[50:26] saw his star we said we have saw his
[50:29] star in the east and are come to worship
[50:32] him they came from the East where they
[50:34] saw the star going west because India is
[50:37] west north of of Palestine and they come
[50:40] right down by the tig Tigris River and
[50:44] crossed over the plains right on in come
[50:47] down into Bethlehem where they found the
[50:50] baby and remember Joseph and them never
[50:54] left there they went right down to
[50:56] Nazareth and brought the child up right
[51:00] there looking at the
[51:04] story Herod he figured that he could
[51:07] just use the Magi for his own
[51:11] purpose God was actually doing something
[51:13] through these men God had given these
[51:16] men a gift to be able to discern the
[51:20] time and the season a and to go and
[51:23] actually acknowledge that this boy had
[51:26] been born who wasn't just an ordinary
[51:28] boy that it was actually truly Jesus in
[51:32] flesh and we know this story here
[51:34] brothers and sisters when when we talk
[51:36] about this the Catholic church is not
[51:38] ignorant to the fact that this was a
[51:41] child and if you wonder how could that
[51:44] be if you ever take a look at a picture
[51:46] of Mary with her baby the baby isn't
[51:49] just a little tiny freshly born infant
[51:53] many times it's depicted as as like a
[51:56] 2-year-old child and it's such a strange
[52:00] thing the way the Catholic church has it
[52:02] but they know they know full well what
[52:04] the story
[52:06] is but Mary being the mother of the baby
[52:11] she wanted to see the best for him and
[52:13] and just followed the instruction of the
[52:15] Lord I I say as parents just let us
[52:18] follow the instruction of the Lord for
[52:19] us let us follow the word for our day in
[52:22] our lives a as as as mothers and fathers
[52:27] but but this man Herod he was just a
[52:28] lunatic who was so insecure he was just
[52:31] a puppet in the land and and he was
[52:34] afraid that someone was going to come
[52:35] and take his position that was given to
[52:37] him and so he just did the blanket
[52:39] statement just kill them all and and and
[52:41] we'll see what happens in the end and
[52:43] hopefully he'll be able to maintain his
[52:45] position but God he was always a step
[52:48] ahead he wasn't at all interested in
[52:51] seeing that that that go down the way
[52:53] that he wanted it to but uh we know that
[52:55] these these Magi when they came they
[52:58] were they were appointed to come they
[53:00] were given the ability they had a gift
[53:03] to see that light and that was for a
[53:05] purpose because Jesus wasn't an ordinary
[53:08] baby we know we' talked about at the
[53:10] very beginning this was this was God who
[53:12] was given to the Earth this was God's
[53:14] gift to the Earth and we've heard that
[53:16] said many times that people think that
[53:18] they're God's gift and what a a slang
[53:20] term that truly is because there really
[53:22] only is one gift from God and that is it
[53:25] eternal life that we've been given and
[53:27] that is through the life of Jesus Christ
[53:30] but these wise men were given a a a gift
[53:32] to know that there is actually something
[53:35] significant something Supernatural
[53:38] happened and and maybe they found some
[53:40] prophecy maybe someone had prophesied in
[53:43] their in their in their native land and
[53:46] and said that there was going to be the
[53:48] Messiah was coming to Earth and and they
[53:51] knew they had to go and see this can you
[53:54] imagine the desire that must have been
[53:55] in their heart for two years following
[53:58] this light following this sign chasing
[54:01] this star it's called many times by
[54:04] people but when they went they went with
[54:07] a purpose and and their purpose was to
[54:09] bring gifts unto this baby boy and we
[54:12] know the gifts the gifts are are gold
[54:15] frankincense and myrrh and each one of
[54:18] them has a very specific purpose brother
[54:20] Bram in this message now he says now
[54:23] gold in the Bible how fitting it fits to
[54:25] Christ because gold speaks of
[54:28] deity gold is
[54:31] deity we'll get get to it just in a
[54:34] moment frankincense speaks of service
[54:36] and myrr is death God deity and service
[54:41] to die and that's what he was the very
[54:43] thing that they brought
[54:46] identified what they thought he
[54:49] was and I say that to us today the
[54:54] things that we bring to him identifies
[54:58] what our thoughts is about
[55:01] him the things that we bring to him
[55:05] identifies what our thoughts is about
[55:09] him he says you understand what I mean
[55:12] see if you believe it with all your
[55:15] heart every word of that you'll identify
[55:19] it by giving all that you have to it see
[55:23] but if you believe it's a good place to
[55:26] associate with better people around the
[55:29] church and things like that that's just
[55:32] about what you give just a few social
[55:34] hours with some of the congregation or
[55:37] something but if you really believe with
[55:40] all your heart then you give everything
[55:44] that's in you to it see and it
[55:47] identifies you that you truly believe
[55:51] the message that you believe it to be
[55:54] the truth
[55:56] truth I think some of these things can
[55:58] just be spoken and it just happens so
[56:01] quickly and it just goes by and it can
[56:03] you know go proverbially in one ear and
[56:05] out the other ear brothers and sisters
[56:07] don't let these words fall don't let
[56:09] them fall on on Barren ground let them
[56:13] fall into our heart to recognize that
[56:15] our lives represent the degree of belief
[56:19] we have about this message of the houren
[56:22] when we really believe then we give it
[56:24] with all of our heart heart it
[56:25] identifies you that you truly believe
[56:27] the
[56:28] message brother bam says so many people
[56:31] say I can believe this much I can
[56:33] believe so the disciples I believe the
[56:36] last time here I spoke on that Believers
[56:38] make Believers and unbelievers wasn't
[56:40] that it I I didn't speak on it here see
[56:44] and each person watch their
[56:47] category and that's why I say brothers
[56:49] and sisters we have been given the eyes
[56:51] to
[56:52] see but we don't want our own eyes
[56:55] because if we start looking around with
[56:56] our own eyes we're going to say look at
[56:57] that brother the way he's
[56:59] behaving and I'm not in any way
[57:01] encouraging us to start looking around
[57:03] and judging people what I want to do is
[57:06] have us look around and say we can
[57:08] identify things then let's go on our
[57:10] knees and pray for them let's do what
[57:12] Jesus did In The Garden of Gethsemane
[57:14] let's go on our knees and pray for one
[57:16] another and encourage one another and
[57:18] you know if you want to take it a step
[57:19] further the word of God says to confess
[57:21] your faults one to another oh my but
[57:24] that takes a lot of courage that takes a
[57:25] lot of trust because as soon as you do
[57:28] that you make yourself vulnerable you
[57:30] talk about something the devil's working
[57:32] you over on but you know the word of God
[57:34] says that's where power lies when you do
[57:37] that when you confess your faults one to
[57:38] another then you can pray for one
[57:40] another you know where you need to
[57:42] bolster in your brother your sister's
[57:50] life brother brandom says in each person
[57:52] watch their category see it'll come to a
[57:55] place to where they can take so much of
[57:58] it can't take the
[58:00] rest we want to see everyone be able to
[58:03] take it all amen yes so brother bamy
[58:06] talks about these gifts now that the
[58:08] wise men
[58:10] bring that they were appointed to bring
[58:13] there's no accident that they actually
[58:14] came from the East and they had the
[58:17] desire to come and find this baby they
[58:19] had gifts they had a service to do God's
[58:22] Gift always find their place could you
[58:25] imagine that though they didn't have GPS
[58:28] there was no handwritten road maps I can
[58:30] imagine there wasn't maybe there was how
[58:33] did they get
[58:34] around there was something guiding
[58:39] them talking about gold brother bradam
[58:41] says now notice now his works created
[58:44] him or identified him to be the
[58:49] Creator his works that he did crowned
[58:52] his life's testimony
[58:55] we know that what he's talking about
[58:56] Jesus said you know if you can't believe
[58:58] me the words that I speak then believe
[59:02] the actions that you see because they
[59:06] testify of who I
[59:08] am the the the ability to create the
[59:12] ability to raise from the dead the
[59:13] ability to heal who can do that except
[59:16] for
[59:18] God his works that he did crowned his
[59:20] life's testimony that he was the creator
[59:24] no way of getting away from it therefore
[59:27] when they offered the gift of gold they
[59:30] were perfectly at Harmony with god with
[59:34] their
[59:35] gift they gave him gold which identified
[59:39] him as
[59:41] deity I think this is so powerful
[59:43] brothers and sisters many times we can
[59:44] look at the Christmas story and say gold
[59:46] frankincense and myrr and you know it's
[59:48] in his songs and different things but to
[59:51] hear what the prophet of God says about
[59:53] this this was identifying as a gift to
[59:56] the baby child this was identifying
[59:59] deity was born on Earth for the first
[1:00:03] time ever this was God in Flesh
[1:00:06] manifested on Earth just tremendous
[1:00:09] brother Bram he says him as deity always
[1:00:12] the crown the Golden Crown the golden
[1:00:14] head the king of Nebuchadnezzar all you
[1:00:16] see it always deity is represented by
[1:00:20] gold frankincense now frankincense we
[1:00:23] want to get these quickly Lankin sense
[1:00:25] is the offering of service to
[1:00:28] Jehovah now if you want to put these
[1:00:30] scriptures down Leviticus 2:2 and
[1:00:32] Leviticus 166 to 15 we find out that's
[1:00:37] the order of the priesthood to make an
[1:00:39] offering to Jehovah when he made the
[1:00:42] offering it had to be made with and
[1:00:44] mixed with frankincense for a sin
[1:00:47] offering and they took different things
[1:00:49] and mixed it for the meal offering for
[1:00:51] the wave offering the frankincense was
[1:00:54] at added because it was acceptable to
[1:00:56] Jehovah if it was anointed with
[1:01:00] frankincense which means it is a service
[1:01:03] to Jehovah God and now we find out he's
[1:01:07] deity and they brought him frankincense
[1:01:10] was a type that he was service to
[1:01:13] Jehovah Jesus is Jehovah's
[1:01:18] servant no accident that these gifts
[1:01:20] were brought the way they were brought
[1:01:22] it wasn't just their custom from the
[1:01:24] East
[1:01:25] to bring these three gifts and and give
[1:01:27] them to them this was very specifically
[1:01:29] ordained by God for these men to bring
[1:01:32] these
[1:01:33] gifts it was identifying who he was now
[1:01:36] in s St Matthew 12:15 to 21 we find out
[1:01:40] that he was Jehovah's servant behold my
[1:01:43] servant in whom I am well pleased and he
[1:01:45] was and I put my strength upon him so
[1:01:48] his life was anointed with frankincense
[1:01:52] to Jehovah's service what what a gift
[1:01:55] them wise men gave see it was something
[1:01:57] to give the gift they give was something
[1:02:01] to identify Jesus as Jehovah's servant
[1:02:05] amen now if we could only do that yes to
[1:02:10] identify Our Lives
[1:02:14] see our lives to be identified as
[1:02:17] Jehovah's
[1:02:18] servant it's one reason why I like
[1:02:20] talking to Jehovah's Witnesses it's the
[1:02:23] first thing they'll do is introduce
[1:02:25] themselves and say I'm I'm a Jehovah's
[1:02:27] Witness and I love to say you are well I
[1:02:31] am
[1:02:34] too and they don't know what to say
[1:02:36] because they say well what what what
[1:02:38] Association are you and and then you get
[1:02:40] to get into the discussion right but you
[1:02:43] know if we're Believers then brothers
[1:02:44] and sisters we're in Jehovah's service
[1:02:47] also I don't think personally that
[1:02:49] there's a greater Jehovah's Witness on
[1:02:51] the Earth today than someone who has
[1:02:53] been baptized AP ized by the true
[1:02:55] baptism of the Holy Spirit and I'm not
[1:02:57] going to say that that that someone who
[1:03:00] just believes the message of the hour
[1:03:01] because I could say it this way and I
[1:03:03] I'll believe it with all my heart
[1:03:05] brothers and sisters there could be
[1:03:06] somebody who is in another sort of group
[1:03:09] somewhere else that's been baptized in
[1:03:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:03:12] the remission of their sins and you
[1:03:14] can't tell me for a second that they
[1:03:16] won't get the Holy Ghost in their
[1:03:18] life we're talking about God this is the
[1:03:21] creator he has everything ordained for
[1:03:24] his way for his purpose and we can try
[1:03:26] and fit it all into our mental
[1:03:28] conception into our box something that
[1:03:30] we can recognize and acknowledge that
[1:03:32] fits the way we believe and God's going
[1:03:35] to take it one day and smash that box
[1:03:37] wide open and say hey you know what I'm
[1:03:39] God you're the man just follow me and
[1:03:43] I'll show
[1:03:45] you I just want to say an example of
[1:03:47] that you know how could how could that
[1:03:49] thief on the cross the thief on the
[1:03:52] cross how could he make it to heaven
[1:03:55] when he got to Heaven they would say to
[1:03:57] him you know when were you
[1:03:58] baptized right how did you get here what
[1:04:01] church did you go to what were your good
[1:04:04] works who were your
[1:04:06] parents how long did you believe about
[1:04:10] 30
[1:04:11] seconds can you believe
[1:04:13] that the only thing you would have to
[1:04:15] say is I just talked to a man that said
[1:04:18] I get to come where he saidj that's all
[1:04:21] and it's no different for every one of
[1:04:23] us we just been been told by a man that
[1:04:26] you you are the sinless Spotless bride
[1:04:29] of Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ and with that baptism of the Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost we become deity living out through
[1:04:39] us and we get ourselves in service
[1:04:43] something causes us it constrains us to
[1:04:45] act and I believe that's why we're all
[1:04:47] here today something constrained us to
[1:04:49] be in Jehovah's service cuz this is not
[1:04:51] Barry's service this is Jehovah's
[1:04:53] service
[1:04:56] am brother bam says now if we could only
[1:04:58] do that to identify Our Lives see our
[1:05:01] lives to be identified as Jehovah's
[1:05:03] servant that's what frankincense was for
[1:05:06] that made him Jehovah's
[1:05:09] servant and I just want to throw this in
[1:05:11] there brothers and sisters Romans 12:1
[1:05:13] says I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[1:05:16] the mercies of God that you present your
[1:05:20] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:05:23] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:05:24] reasonable
[1:05:26] service I just love this and be not
[1:05:28] conformed to this
[1:05:30] world if we're caught up in this world
[1:05:33] brothers and sisters forget it forget
[1:05:35] about it don't be caught up in this
[1:05:37] world be be be be Heavenly minded be
[1:05:41] thinking about this rapturing Faith be
[1:05:43] thinking about all this stuff we still
[1:05:45] have commitments and lives to live down
[1:05:47] here but don't allow these things down
[1:05:49] here to hold us back from actually being
[1:05:52] able to go on be not conformed to this
[1:05:56] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:05:58] renewing of your mind that you may be
[1:06:01] able to prove what is that good and
[1:06:03] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[1:06:06] that word besee you
[1:06:09] parm
[1:06:10] oh it's uh it's the word it says to call
[1:06:13] near that is to invite invoke by
[1:06:16] imploration or horation or consolation
[1:06:20] beseech call for be of good Comfort
[1:06:23] desire give
[1:06:25] exhort entreat
[1:06:28] pray all of those words I beseech you
[1:06:32] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:06:34] that you present your bodies a Living
[1:06:36] Sacrifice
[1:06:38] frankincense mixed with deity
[1:06:41] frankincense mixed with that Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] every single day of our lives like Paul
[1:06:45] said I die out daily so that he might
[1:06:48] live through me and this world will see
[1:06:51] it around you brothers and sisters as we
[1:06:54] close the service let's talk about myrr
[1:06:57] myrr myrr was the anointing of the death
[1:07:01] we find in St John the 19th Chapter the
[1:07:05] 39th verse that going to the funeral
[1:07:08] service of Jesus when Mary and them went
[1:07:12] they take in this myrr to anoint
[1:07:15] him with because he must be the servant
[1:07:19] of death for Jehovah see am somebody had
[1:07:22] to die that was a service that had to be
[1:07:25] done for God and nobody was worthy to do
[1:07:28] it but God
[1:07:32] himself so bringing the myrr myrr
[1:07:35] showing that with the deity and with the
[1:07:39] service the deity of Jesus Christ being
[1:07:42] God himself in flesh and the service of
[1:07:46] his life laying it down that he was also
[1:07:49] Anointed with myrrh that this deity had
[1:07:53] to be put to death in order to save the
[1:07:57] imperfect one oh what a great thing can
[1:08:00] you believe that the deity had to be put
[1:08:03] to
[1:08:04] death in order to save the imperfect
[1:08:07] one I'm not going to try and interpret
[1:08:10] that and I don't think that we need to
[1:08:12] try and interpret that some might want
[1:08:13] to I just want to say you know what I I
[1:08:16] know it was the blood of Jesus that
[1:08:18] actually atoned for my sins and the only
[1:08:21] blood that could do that would have to
[1:08:22] be God's own blood
[1:08:24] that that can't be another man's blood
[1:08:26] there can be no Vicor to Christ there
[1:08:28] can be no Vicor to God I just think it's
[1:08:30] beautiful brothers and sisters and
[1:08:32] brother bam he says it you know now now
[1:08:34] look how beautiful these gifts fit into
[1:08:36] Jesus Christ see gold speaking of his
[1:08:39] deity now they wasn't heathens they were
[1:08:42] inspired by God they wasn't imagining
[1:08:46] something that proves right there even
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:49] Magi that they did see the
[1:08:52] supernatural because their own gift that
[1:08:55] they offered identified and spoke well
[1:08:59] of their testimony that they did see the
[1:09:01] supernatural
[1:09:03] light traveled for two years put their
[1:09:06] jobs on hold they must have taken leaves
[1:09:09] told everyone flipped the sign in the
[1:09:11] window of their office or their shop and
[1:09:13] said you know we're going to be back
[1:09:15] we're seeing you later we don't know
[1:09:16] when but we're going to go we're going
[1:09:17] to follow this store and we're going to
[1:09:19] see what happens and we know two years
[1:09:21] down the road here they are
[1:09:24] they finally achieved their goal but
[1:09:26] brother bradam saying here they weren't
[1:09:27] just men deciding to go and do something
[1:09:29] fantastic they were appointed they were
[1:09:31] anointed of God right that proves right
[1:09:34] there even the Magi that they did see
[1:09:36] the supernatural because their own gift
[1:09:39] that they offered identified and spoke
[1:09:42] well of their testimony that they did
[1:09:45] see the supernatural light because why
[1:09:48] it speaks perfectly they brought gold
[1:09:51] deity they brought frankincense service
[1:09:54] and they brought myrrh for his death
[1:09:57] when he was a baby amen showing that
[1:10:00] deity would be put to Death In the Flesh
[1:10:04] amen that it might redeem Fallen men how
[1:10:08] can people turn that down my how can
[1:10:12] people turn that
[1:10:13] down I I I'll call the musicians as we
[1:10:16] close this portion of the service
[1:10:19] because we've got the baptismal uh I
[1:10:21] still have a little bit more I want to
[1:10:22] say I just want to prove to you that I'm
[1:10:24] closing I'm not going for the creatures
[1:10:26] 20 minutes
[1:10:30] but brother Ram he says when you
[1:10:33] realize what what are we doing here amen
[1:10:38] where did we come from or what business
[1:10:41] have we got being here we wasn't put
[1:10:44] here just by a chance we were put here
[1:10:47] for a purpose and we must serve that
[1:10:52] purpose and I just want want to say
[1:10:54] brothers and sisters what's your purpose
[1:10:56] today amen you know when I was young my
[1:10:59] dad said to me many
[1:11:01] times he said if I could give you any
[1:11:03] suggestions or any
[1:11:05] advice he said this to me while I was
[1:11:08] young he said find the will of God for
[1:11:09] your
[1:11:11] life and I thought what does that mean
[1:11:14] even how do I find the will of God for
[1:11:16] my
[1:11:19] life I can look at it now and say you
[1:11:22] know perhaps maybe it was to be preacher
[1:11:24] maybe it was to be a dad maybe it was to
[1:11:27] have a business maybe it was to do some
[1:11:29] of the things in my life that I've done
[1:11:31] but more than anything brothers and
[1:11:32] sisters I I personally believe more than
[1:11:35] anything for myself and I trust you're
[1:11:38] included in that is to find the will of
[1:11:40] God for your life is to find out that
[1:11:42] that salvation is yours as
[1:11:44] well you know I was talking to a young
[1:11:48] person who sent sent me an email saying
[1:11:50] that they have a a terrible problem and
[1:11:53] and they don't know what to do and and
[1:11:55] they feel like they made a deal with the
[1:11:57] devil they sold their soul to the devil
[1:11:59] and you know something came over me I
[1:12:01] was like what could I ever say to a
[1:12:03] person like that what could you give for
[1:12:05] advice and it's it just came to me the
[1:12:08] the Lord said it to me how could you
[1:12:10] ever ever do something with with with a
[1:12:13] soul that's not even your own how how
[1:12:16] could you ever make a deal with someone
[1:12:20] over your soul when you don't even own
[1:12:22] it and I just my goodness isn't that
[1:12:25] tremendous brothers and sisters what
[1:12:27] he's done for us he's given us the
[1:12:29] ability to recognize we never had
[1:12:31] nothing to do with it we just recognized
[1:12:33] it one
[1:12:35] day ain't nobody going to go and make a
[1:12:37] deal with the devil you can't do that
[1:12:40] that's a lie of the
[1:12:42] devil because all life comes from God
[1:12:45] and he would that all would come unto
[1:12:49] him where did we come from or what
[1:12:52] business have we got being here brothers
[1:12:54] and sisters we wasn't put here just by
[1:12:56] chance we were put here for a purpose
[1:12:59] and we must serve that purpose but still
[1:13:02] we are back on the basis of free moral
[1:13:05] agency where can we serve it where we
[1:13:09] can serve it or reject it just like Adam
[1:13:13] did in the
[1:13:16] beginning I just want to say today
[1:13:18] brothers and sisters boy I've got lots
[1:13:22] more maybe stand with me this morning I
[1:13:25] just want to say we have the
[1:13:27] opportunity to actually give our
[1:13:31] lives in service for the king I want to
[1:13:35] say that when we come to that knowledge
[1:13:37] that recognition of truly surrendering
[1:13:41] Our Lives to God then we too are just
[1:13:44] like those wise men and I believe
[1:13:47] brother Bram says it in the message
[1:13:48] somewhere I don't have it this morning
[1:13:50] but when we can give our lives
[1:13:53] understand in if we have the ability to
[1:13:55] have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's
[1:13:56] truly deity brothers and sisters it's
[1:13:58] not any less God don't ever think for a
[1:14:01] second the Holy Ghost is a second or a
[1:14:03] third person or or another entity it's
[1:14:06] God himself in flesh once again that is
[1:14:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:14:11] deity and that causes an action to
[1:14:14] happen in your life when you truly get
[1:14:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[1:14:18] action can be many different Avenues of
[1:14:20] things but there's one thing that's more
[1:14:22] important than anything and that is to
[1:14:23] line up with that word the baptism of
[1:14:26] the Holy Ghost will always always line
[1:14:29] up with the word of God
[1:14:31] always and I just want to say you know
[1:14:33] we read it brother brandham says
[1:14:36] it that that that that order dedicate
[1:14:41] ourselves we have a purpose and and find
[1:14:44] out what that purpose is it all starts
[1:14:48] with the recognizing that there's
[1:14:50] actually a gift for us if we're willing
[1:14:52] to Humble ourselves before the Lord if
[1:14:54] we're willing to follow the word for our
[1:14:56] day and get truly baptized in the name
[1:14:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:15:00] remission of our sins what will happen
[1:15:02] that's the start of the journey brothers
[1:15:04] and sisters and we can say you know it
[1:15:06] doesn't get any easier from there our
[1:15:08] trials are coming anyways we're going to
[1:15:10] get our trials they're already
[1:15:12] coming but what a what a Blessed
[1:15:14] Assurance it is to know that we've got
[1:15:16] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives as we go
[1:15:19] through our trials boy oh boy oh boy
[1:15:22] it's a tremendous thing what a mighty
[1:15:24] God we
[1:15:26] serve let's just bow in
[1:15:29] prayer gracious Heavenly Father we know
[1:15:32] that you have given us free moral agency
[1:15:35] Lord and we know that you have placed a
[1:15:39] soul in each one of our Lives Lord Jesus

[1:15:52] can afflict our minds he can he can
[1:15:55] affect our emotions he can try and do
