[0:00] Let's be related to be in the house of
[0:01] the Lord. Just going to sing a medley
[0:03] this morning. There are songs that you
[0:05] [Music]
[0:16] know.
[0:19] Jesus paid it all.
[0:27] To him I
[0:30] [Music]
[0:32] owe.
[0:34] Sin had left a crimson
[0:40] stain, but
[0:42] he
[0:44] washed me
[0:46] white as snow.
[0:48] [Music]
[0:53] Oh,
[0:55] precious is the
[0:59] flow that makes
[1:04] me white as
[1:07] snow.
[1:10] No
[1:11] other, no other found I know.
[1:16] Oh,
[1:18] nothing but the
[1:20] blood of
[1:21] [Music]
[1:25] Jesus. For it
[1:28] reaches to the
[1:31] highest
[1:33] [Music]
[1:35] mountain and it
[1:38] flows to the
[1:41] lowest valley.
[1:45] Oh, it's the
[1:48] blood gives me strength from
[1:52] day to day.
[1:56] It will
[1:57] never never
[2:00] lose its
[2:03] power. And it
[2:07] reaches to the
[2:10] highest
[2:13] mountain. And that blood it
[2:17] flows to the
[2:20] lowest valley.
[2:22] [Music]
[2:24] Oh, the
[2:26] blood that gives me
[2:28] strength from
[2:33] today. It will
[2:36] never It will never lose. It will
[2:41] never never lose. It will
[2:45] never never
[2:48] lose its power.
[2:51] And in Christ
[2:55] alone my hope is
[3:01] found. He is my light, my
[3:04] [Laughter]
[3:05] strength, my son.
[3:09] This corner
[3:12] stone, this solid
[3:16] ground firm through the fences
[3:21] drought and
[3:23] storm. What heights of
[3:27] love, what deaths of
[3:30] peace when fears are
[3:34] tears, when strivings cease.
[3:39] is my comforter. Who is it to you? Is my
[3:43] all in
[3:45] all here in the love of
[3:49] Christ I
[3:52] [Music]
[3:55] stand in Christ
[3:59] alone. He took on
[4:01] [Music]
[4:02] confession fullness of God in hell.
[4:07] Last
[4:08] [Music]
[4:09] B. This gift of
[4:12] love and
[4:16] rightuousness scorned by the ones he
[4:20] came to save.
[4:23] Seal on that
[4:26] cross as Jesus
[4:29] died. The wrath of
[4:32] God was
[4:35] satisfied for every
[4:39] sin on him was
[4:42] laid. Now here in the death of
[4:46] Christ I believe.
[4:50] [Music]
[4:53] Where in the
[4:55] ground his body
[4:59] lay light of the world by
[5:03] darkness messain oh then busting
[5:08] forth in glorious
[5:12] day up from the grave he
[5:16] rose
[5:18] again and has he
[5:21] stands in
[5:24] victory since cause has
[5:27] lost its grip on me. Hallelujah. For I
[5:32] am
[5:34] his and is mine.
[5:38] Not with the precious
[5:41] blood of
[5:46] Christ. No guilt in
[5:49] life, no fear in
[5:53] death. This is the power of
[5:57] Christ in me.
[6:00] From life's first
[6:02] crime to final
[6:06] breath, Jesus commands my
[6:10] death in me. So no power of hell.
[6:16] No scheme of
[6:18] man can ever
[6:21] block me from a
[6:24] stand till he
[6:27] returns to take me
[6:31] home. Here in the power of
[6:34] Christ I'll stand.
[6:38] And as he
[6:39] stands in
[6:42] victory, sins cast as
[6:46] lost its grip on
[6:49] me. For I am
[6:52] his and is
[6:54] [Music]
[6:56] mine. Hearing the death of
[7:00] Christ I'll leave. Oh, thank you Jesus.
[7:06] Amen.
[7:08] [Applause]
[7:27] God bless you all.
