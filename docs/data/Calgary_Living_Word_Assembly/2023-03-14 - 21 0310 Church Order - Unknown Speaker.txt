could ever pay back and we were never intended to pay back it was the free gift of God unto us his grace to his children welcome to the house of the Lord again on a Wednesday night we just want to remember a few prayer requests continuing in prayer for sister Vicki sister Grace's friend's mother I believe she's in Connecticut no I can't remember where she is but she needs a touch from the master she's on a ventilator because of kovid with pneumonia and naturally speaking it doesn't look good but Supernatural speaking Anything is Possible we just want to continue to remember Sister Becky we also want to remember Sister Jermaine and we have two unspoken requests tonight that we would like to bring Before the Throne and if you have a need maybe just make it known to him with an uplifted hand as we go in prayer we have another request for Brennan Brennan's wife Katie not sure what it is but we know he knows let's go to prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord one more time we're so thankful that we can just come before your throne of mercy and Grace and Lord Jesus to know that when we come according to your word which is according to your will father we are experiencing the culmination of all of the ages and Lord Jesus more than anything we know that you are just waiting to hear our voice that you want to hear our confession about what your word says in a situation as we encounter it and Lord Jesus what an honor and a privilege it is to be a shining light in this Dark Age father we just want to remember Brennan's wife Katie tonight Lord we don't know the need but we know you do and father we know that you you had the answer before the need was ever manifested on the lips of brother Paul so father we pray that it would just be a strong witness of your life in brother Paul that it would move beyond what is a confession on the lips of a man to his staff but that it would just become the living Jesus Christ on Earth that it would be you tabernacled in flesh in our brother to his staff Lord we pray that it would just be a powerful testimony of your grace Lord we just want to remember Sister Vicki we haven't forgot her Lord and we know that you haven't forgot her father and Lord that you are watching over her even now you have been all along father we know that your eye is on the sparrow and tonight father we just thank you that you are watching over sister Vicki and father we just asked that you would continue to do so father according to your will father we know that sickness is not according to your will so father tonight according to the the the the the authority that you have vested in us as your children tonight we just rebuke that devil of illness in the name of Jesus Christ from our sister Vicki and we pray Lord that you would just raise her up off that bed Lord [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that we monitor that people are welcome here if they can't come in here and get Washed by the Water of the word then how will they ever how will they ever you know and the reason I'm saying this is there's people who actually have really strong beliefs that unless you actually come to the door at a certain level you won't be able to get in there's churches out there that way there's churches that believe that unless you're born into a lineage message churches message churches that believe if you don't get if you're not born in a certain lineage you'll never make it to heaven it's an antichrist Spirit brothers and sisters that is a cult that is a cult the message of the hour is not a cult the message of the hour is Jesus Christ on Earth again welcoming the publicans and the sinners speaking to prostitutes could you imagine that speaking to the prostitute allowing a prostitute to cry on his feet and wash his feet with her hair with her tears spending good money on an ointment that could have been given to the poor oh it could have had perfect religious form right we're not about that brothers and sisters no way that's an antichrist Spirit anything other than what the prophet says for this age brothers and sisters that's our benchmark it's an antichrist spirit and it's going to make the church lukewarm formal and Powerless and we're not into it not into it at all brother Branham goes on to say that there's fanaticism and there's fanaticism in every single age and there's fanaticism even in around the message and and it's just the way it is Devils love the truth that's where they come in and they get around where there's fanaticism he says although in such we have found throughout the world that there is much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be Apostolic Believers some of the most religious people with the most religious motion Fanatics and you know what we don't want to we don't want to Major on this but but there are people but you know what we've said it last time they're scarecrows and and scarecrows get raised up Satan raises up scarecrows around the truth to try and stop the True Believers from actually getting that Apostolic blessing and tonight we just want to rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ where you see a scarecrow brothers and sisters don't run don't get scared if you see someone that's a little bit fanatical if you see someone that kind of Acts a little bit off maybe just take a moment and look at their life examine them give them an opportunity to speak contact their spirit is what brother Bradham said that that he did and and that's what Jesus did with that woman at the well it's the same spirit in in in all of us just take the time to contact a person and see what their spirit is and show them a little bit of that Apostolic life show them that sweet Gentle Spirit maybe that thundering life that we live could actually Thunder out that devil out of that person for a moment just long enough for that person to see that that sliver of light that's there in the last Church age through you through us don't let the scarecrows hook us up don't let them scare us off brothers and sisters and standing in the Gap in 63 brother Branham says that's how you know a Christian by how he lives so never jump any higher than you live so then just but there it's a devil making a scarecrow to keep the real genuine Believers away from the true thing of it but God help us to separate and be able to discern between right and wrong help us to separate not God we have been told to discern the spirits not just ask God to protect us and and live a narrow life that just runs down the middle and we don't look one way or the other we're supposed to interact with people around us and discern the spirits we have nothing to fear brothers and sisters if we have his holy spirit in US there's nothing that we should fear he says but God help us to separate and be able to discern between right and wrong and the word will always straighten that out out of perseverance he says but my sons don't be disturbed now just before his appearing there's going to be all kinds of fanaticism raised up around it always is it's the devil trying to put a scarecrow out see scare you away but remember the scarecrows is always at the good tree so why we're talking about this brothers and sisters is I Want To Set set set this out there sort of I just want to put this before us if we see gifts rise up in the body don't be afraid of it we don't want to be afraid of it we want allow to manifest and we want to encourage it because if it's of the word God will prosper it if it's not of the word God will actually hinder it but it's up to us to set that example it's up to us to give it the ability to be nurtured not be scared away because of something that we experienced early on in our Christian walks or maybe we've seen or heard about it in another message church or or church around the world or whatever no we just want to see what the Lord will do here we're trying to make sure that we have everything in place to see this Apostolic blessing so that when people come through these doors brothers and sisters we talked about it a long time ago I believe brother Branham says when we have such unity in the body there ain't one disease that can come through that door we can challenge any disease to come through that door and it cannot stand in the presence of God can you imagine if we just had one God here one Jesus Christ here but I can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven Lord Jesus Christ's here with flesh on can you imagine how many devils in Hell could stand in the midst of that omnipotence but you know we have to come to the place where we believe that brothers and sisters we've got to come to the place where we believe that brother Branham says the Scarecrow he'll try and scare you away but remember the scarecrows is always at the good tree just remember that not out on the old Sour Apples no it's always where the good eating's at so he said Just remember now there will be some raise up saying they're this and some saying they're that and some saying so forth and claiming Messiahs and everything else but don't you believe it now the only way to be sure is what take what the word says it's always the word brothers and sisters so we want to see the manifestation of the spirit in our midst it's something that brother Branham talked about he said now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all every one of us has the Holy Spirit every one of us has a gift that's going to manifest because of that Holy Spirit in our lives I'm not here to say what is or what isn't I don't want to analyze what gifts are and and how they should operate and what your strength is and do a color chart I'm not into that we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives God will manifest that gift in your life brothers and sisters just keep feeding on the word keep watering that gift by the word listen to the message read the Bible pray and see if God won't manifest that gift in your life now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us now on most places we find that when these people when sorry now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring reproach and you know brothers and sisters this is what I'm talking about the Scarecrow there can be people maybe in our past who have done this who have brought reproach but that doesn't change the word it doesn't change the fact that there are gifts in the church so we don't want to be afraid we want to come according to the word we already read it the word will straighten it out and we'll be able to go forwards he says which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days the message of the hour the words the message of the hour people operate in a in a in a strange Behavior the devil gets into the people and they don't know how to operate the gifts they don't know how to use them and they wind up causing reproach to what we believe is the message of the hour that doesn't change the word that doesn't change the message doesn't change God one iota not one bit in our lives we don't have to be afraid even if someone has done that brothers and sisters just keep marching forward just keep shoulder to shoulder just keep real sweet just keep real love keep that Unity be thundering out hurt to the devil every time we speak with our voice because that's what hurts the devil you know we talked about it we get to get to the place where Satan just won't even know what to do with us another place we read Satan just won't even be able to find us another place we're reading is that we're going to be able to hurt the devil my goodness I I don't know people who are not according to the word they're the ones that will actually not know what to do with the gifts when the word is in US brothers and sisters we'll know when that inner teacher comes the spirit of Truth he'll lead us into all truth I'm just gonna fast forward here a little bit brother Branham says there's a few things few other things he says I think the first thing and we believe these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the Bradham Tabernacle why for it to prosper in the Lord and I think if we had to summarize it that's kind of it for tonight brothers and sisters the reason we're talking about this again the reason we're trying to go through it real systematically over and over and over recap just come to a place and then recap and then come to a little further place and recap and go all the way through it is just so that we can do exactly that for it to prosper in the Lord we want to see this church prosper in the Lord we want to see the children prosper in the Lord we want to see the old people prosper in the Lord we want every single member of this mystical body of Jesus Christ to prosper in the Lord we don't want to just be coming to church just to be coming to church living below our privileges he says I think first that every member or every worshiper of the Branham Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would it would their hearts would long for each other when they would have to go away to leave each other at the end of service at night I'm a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this matter will all men know that you are my disciples that you have love one for another not worried about something someone said and you know I I've said it so many times I'm just going to carry on we all know worshipers should meet together brother Branham says it if we have people who feel like they have gifts and people who really want to have prayer meetings and so on and so forth brother Branham says it right here that you know what we should do is actually meet before service and and and I say it I've said it I'll say it again I'm here at least an hour before many times many hours before and and I'll make sure that door is open for any person that wants to come and start getting in the spirit that wants to come and start setting that atmosphere because they know that that service is just like no other service it's going to be the best service ever and that's really what needs to happen in our hearts brothers and sisters forget about all the past Services we've had some good ones but what about right now today it's like having a Pentecostal experience in our lives it's like being saved you know what's good to talk about a prophet and and what God did in his life it's good to talk about all the heroes of the Bible but what good does that do me today I need to see that Apostolic blessing in my own life come and set that atmosphere let's do it together brother Branham says worshipers should meet together now the next thing we we believe that these worshipers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever begin the church should be opened early and the Believers come together on these nights and at least 45 minutes to an hour before the service begin we've got people that want to have prayer meetings why don't we get together and actually have a prayer meeting before service we're going to have a jubilee brother Branham calls it a gastronomical jubilee we're going to get together and meet with the Lord Jesus Christ with all of our brothers and sisters let's bring our licks of fire together and see what can be done you know we we typically start half an hour early we're talking 15 15 minutes to uh 45 minutes earlier than that you know what brothers and sisters it's a commitment we've all got busy lives but you know what the Lord he wants to see what are we willing to do are we willing to sacrifice a little bit are we willing to give a little bit more we've talked about money in terms of tithe forget about money what about our time more than anything he wants to hear the confession on our lips he wants us to know who we are and what we're doing when we come together to meet in a service like this brothers and sisters I don't think that anybody should leave sick and that's just my opinion but I mean hey I've been sick I've come to church sick and I've left church sick I'm not going to say anything about anybody but you know we have an opportunity to set an atmosphere in this building and we've heard brother Bradham say it that if we can have that Unity of spirit and that's really what it's about brothers and sisters coming together and getting in that Unity of spirit forget about all the things in this life all the pressures of work all the pressures of school what somebody said what they didn't say all of the stuff that we deal with on our Cardinal level just for a few hours just push it all aside and see if we can't open up a window of heaven where he could pour out a blessing on our lives on our service that we can't even contain we have the opportunity to do that we're still not shut down here completely I mean there's only 12 people allowed but imagine 12 Messiah ETS gathered together in one place thundering out a life imagine that James 2 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say thou has faith and I have work show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works thou believest that there is one God thou do as well the Devils also believe and tremble and they especially tremble when that life starts to live out through our lives when we say you know maybe what I've been doing is good it's great and I know that God's been pleased but what else can I do what else can I try what else can I experience because I think as long as we're here brothers and sisters we're in a state of cultivation of Our Lives we we have the ability to go higher and go farther and not stay in one place and say that you know it's it's one and done I got saved in 1970. two years before you were born if we have that Spirit brothers and sisters that's an antichrist Spirit it is and it's not a fault all we need to do is rebuke it and move on we just don't need to accept that kind of behavior as long as we're in this flesh we're children children learn we have to learn and grow until we get to that place where we're on the other side where we see that body change you know Enoch pleased God and was not maybe we could get to that place in our own lives until that great day we want to see Jesus speaking about Divine love and questions and answers but it's accepting the person Jesus Christ and these other things come right on in and they fit together that every member in this body this morning this evening let this little group of people if we could pull the curtains down along each side and every person in here receive the person of Christ Jesus there wouldn't never be a fuss there would never be an argument there would just be perfect love you know some people would say yeah sure that's great let's get out the guitar and we'll sing Kumbaya and everything will be fine brothers and sisters we're talking about the Glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle that bride of Jesus Christ the one that he calls his own Mark 16 in action the mature Christian Church the ones that actually believe the message of the hour he says there wouldn't never be a fuss there would never be an argument there'd just be perfect love his love divine love beyond comprehension totally Beyond everything that we can think we wouldn't be fussed why would we be fussed because it's his church it's his program he's got everything under control if we've got a job it's because he gave it to us if we've got Health it's because he gave it to us if we've got a family it's because he gave it to us if we've got a church it's because he gave it to us if we've got an understanding of the message of the hour it's because he gave it to us brothers and sisters it's not because of something we've done it's not because of something someone's taught us it's because of his Sovereign Grace to us because of election what do we have to fear what do we have to get upset about there just be perfect love you would still believe this and believe that we'd still have our opinions and our and our lives but we just wouldn't Express them we'd run our thoughts through the filter of the word in our lives we would take every thought into captivity and not say that's just the way I'm created I can't control my mouth the word says you can there'd be perfect love you'd still believe this and believe that but it would just be so full of love you just see he says that's it now Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness and gentleness I'm gonna just I'm just gonna book on that with this thought that just because we might see someone that really can't control their mouth but they love the lord they're still a son or a daughter they're a sibling in Christ and we need to encourage them the word says to exhort them even more so as you see the day approaching don't slam them and say oh they just talk whatever they think you don't got no filter all that business I don't have to listen to them listen to them they're they're not even saved don't do that pray for them encourage them tell them brother I sure love you when the devil wants you to say can't stand that guy call him up and say brother I sure appreciate you why not because you're lying because the prophet that we all believe to be the prophet said do the opposite do the opposite and see what happens when that Divine love starts to get projected what happens when we project Divine love brothers and sisters Glory you know what he goes on to say justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not another step of Grace but it's more of the same Grace that's what it is brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is not just taking us picking us up cleaning us up setting us aside for service and then giving us an anointing on the outside of our bodies that's going right down into the soul of who we are our very essence it's actually the Capstone to our life to our own pyramids it's that Capstone Revelation that happens to us the Holy Ghost it's more of the same Grace we believe in the New Testament teachings and Paul the Apostle was called and chosen vessel elected by God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order this is what brother Branham says we believe in full immersion water baptism according to Acts 2 38 in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost not the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost not three people not three separate entities but one one God when John made it up through that door in heaven he looked and he saw one throne and he saw one sitting on the throne and he only heard one voice speak to him one we baptize full immersion water baptism as Paul preached and you know what we believe the same promise for today but you know it goes a little bit further than that because there was a time where we prophesied in part and and we spoke in part but we didn't see that that which was perfect was come then but you know brothers and sisters if we have the ability to receive the message of the hour that which is perfect is come that's what the message of the hour is it's the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and revealing himself to those who have ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to receive it it's not just enough to be justified it's not just enough to be Sanctified and it's not just enough to be justified and Sanctified and it's not even enough just to have the Holy Ghost brother Branham said you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life every hour of your life and still go to hell it's a powerful statement and we'll have to drill down on that sometime but really it just means that you can't have it on the outside on your flesh even though you can you can't have it on your spirit which changes you and makes you talk good and sound good and you act good and you're so kind and nice but you just don't believe one part of the word it's right down inside into that Soul when it comes into the soul you become a new creature in Christ Jesus you're not being actually conformed up until that point you're just conforming but you have to be transformed by the renewing of your mind by the washing by the water of the word it's not just enough to go all through all of the exercise and and be there and Justified and Sanctified and and filled with the Holy Ghost I can come to church and act all good it's not about that it's about being able to be the living word for our day that's why this church is called that the Living Word Calgary Living Word it's not just about coming and hearing a word it's living it and if we're talking about anything else we need to just correct that because it's not about us associating with a place that that preaches the Living Word even though that's what it is brothers and sisters it's about getting people to Christ Christ in you the hope of glory having the Living Word in you being an actual Living Word to those people around you you know we have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters I'm not discounting that I'm making sure that we're just going further with it it has to be the literal life of Jesus Christ Living out through us not just something that we do this is the message for our day in times past it was only a portion but today it's the absolute fullness of the word the absolute fullness of the word all seven seals are open that cloud happened for a reason he set his foot on the land and his foot on the sea and said there shall be time no more all of the revelation of Jesus Christ the entire mystery of God is now about to be revealed and today we have given that entire word we have all of it at our disposal brothers and sisters and that's what we say living up to our our our potential living up to our privilege understanding that if we're Messiah it's if we have Jesus Christ Living out through us his holy spirit now permeates through our very being what devil can stand before you there's not one devil that can stand before you if you have the Holy Ghost that she would have that testimony in her world in her surrounding in her sphere of influence father to all those people around her Lord that you wouldn't be just a religion that you wouldn't be just something that we do but father you would be the very essence of Who We Are Lord we just want to remember the two unspoken requests tonight father you know them you know the needs and you know the answers father and we just thank you because you have the answer Lord and we just want to just bring it before your throne with confidence tonight knowing that you will meet the needs whether we want to continue to remember Sister jarmaine before you're thrown Lord Jesus that you would just continue brooding over her father watching over her family Lord Jesus watching over her grandchildren Lord father we pray that you would just continue working with her father that you would just raise her up as well father that we could rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that's afflicting her Lord that we wouldn't just accept the things that are are happening in our lives and say well it's just the way it is and we just have to accept it we know that you have given us Authority Lord according to your word and father we pray that we could just exercise it according to your word not according to our thoughts not according to what we want but truly according to your will and father every other need that was made known to you tonight with an uplifted hand father we pray that

the scriptures we read last week Hebrews chapter 10 and Malachi chapter 3 . we'll look at church order one more time and hopefully we'll we'll wrap it up tonight I believe that we've covered it all quite thoroughly and there might be still things that we have to talk about with it but I don't know how much longer I can stay put on this topic I feel so inspired about so much else so tonight in Hebrews chapter 10 let's read verse 23 to 25. Hebrews 10 23. let us hold fast let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more the more as ye see the day approaching how many sees that day approaching let's turn over to Malachi chapter 3. Malachi chapter 3 verse 16 to 18. Malachi chapter 3 verse 16. than they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we just are so thankful for the scripture that you've given us Lord and the ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church and the eyes to be able to see the things that all the sages and the prophets of of the ages desired to look upon but father you you have chosen us father to be here and to have these abilities not by our strength as we as we heard tonight not by something that we could ever do but simply by your grace father Lord Jesus tonight we accept what you have given us we accept your provided way and Lord we pray that you would just open this word to us one more time that you would just speak to us father lip to ear that Lord I could just get out of the way now and Lord just allow you to use me as a vessel for your children to be fed One More Time Lord I pray that your children wouldn't stumble at the vessel Lord that they wouldn't stumble at the veil that they would recognize you speaking tonight father we just love you and we thank you and we just bless your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated this scripture here is just continually speaking to me verse 16 through 18. then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and you know just to have Fellowship one to another what a tremendous thing it is just to have a conversation with someone someone that you know believes what you believe brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith what a tremendous thing it is before we get going too far we just have a few announcements one of them that's fairly important is that we have a time change coming up this Sunday and uh so Saturday night before you go to bed you want to make sure that you set your clocks ahead we lose an hour spring forward and and fall behind fall back in the fall we'll change it back again but uh so now the days are are getting longer spring is in the air you can hear the birds they have a different song and you know brothers and sisters I just we all believe it when the resurrection happens Springtime happens there's just a different song in the heart of a Believer because we can see that that day draws close we know that Resurrection is imminent and it just changes our song it put us puts a spring in our step we just feel so good to feel that sun shine on us again I just uh it's amazing it just keeps taking me back every spring to it's the rising of the Sun and uh I just guess that's the way the Lord has it set up but uh time change this Sunday March 14th 2 A.M probably do it before you go to bed don't be up at two um it feels better Sunday morning when you're not up that late we have brother Mervin in Lethbridge on Sunday pray for him and we have a virtual young people's coming up on the 19th Friday night so in our scriptures tonight just really spoke to me that word hearkened and you know as I was meditating on this I just I just thought about I believe it was Nathaniel that was under the tree and you know when the disciples came and they got him and they said we found the Messiah you need to come and see don't just listen to what we're saying actually physically come and see what we found see this man and when he got there he said to him behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile he was able to discern the thoughts that was in his heart he understood who he was but he also demonstrated that he understood that in the words that he spoke to him and I just I just thought man isn't that wonderful every time that we we just meditate on him he's hearkening to our thoughts just like he did there in the gospel just like he did for Nathanael he saw him when he was under the tree meditating on him having having just that time that quiet time of meditation according to what he was taught in his tradition and you know as we as Sons and Daughters of God as we have that desire to meditate on him whether we're in our car or whether we're at work or whether we're at church or in the morning when we get up or just when we're going to sleep the the first thing we think about when we wake and the last thing we think about when we lose Consciousness and go into a dream hearkening unto the Lord thinking about him you know the word we read tonight it says then they'd have feared the Lord spake often once in another and exhorted one another even more so as they seen the day approaching not just the physical gathering together but exhorting one another how will men know that you love me by the love you have one for another looking past the veil looking past the Flesh and saying you know maybe my brother says those things and I just don't believe that he means it that way having having a testimony in this world that you can't tell my friends from my enemies because of that divine nature that is in me it's it's the dove leading the lamb it's not a wolf nature no it's not a dead man that you can kick and it still comes to life again call him a hypocrite and see what happens just what brother Branham said that's that's his words dead men don't move when you kick them but many of us were just a little bit too alive still is what brother Branham says I say Lord help me but the Lord hearkened so I just that spoke to me that word I looked it up in in in in the old dictionary it says to listen to lend an ear to attend to what is uttered what are we uttering brothers and sisters are we moaning and groaning because of the trials we've got or are we saying blessed be the name of the Lord the lord giveth and the lord taketh away whatever he wants done is is his will and it's going to work out for the good because I know he's my father and he knows my name he's got everything under his control and all I need to do is just praise His name because it's going to bring out a character in me that he's looking for to listen to lend an ear to attend to what is uttered with eagerness or curiosity can you imagine that God Almighty is is attending to us it's no accident this word was chosen there's no accident this interpretation was written there's no accident that we have this interpretation of it in terms of the the dictionary definition from that era to attend to what is uttered with eagerness or curiosity do you ever do you ever listen to Children talk as a parent and just listen to it with eagerness and curiosity maybe not even as a parent I I know I've heard brother Gilbert talk about being in the school and understanding the the needs in children's lives and seeing children who have strong needs but being able to just listen with curiosity and understand some of the trials that children are going through just by the way they talk but to listen to what is uttered with eagerness or curiosity this is talking about God hearkening to The Voice they that feared the Lord do you fear the lord tonight they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord that thought upon his name it goes from from speaking to thinking about his name that's why I said that thought of Nathaniel how many times do we Ponder the Lord do we Ponder his greatness do we Ponder how many times he's bailed us out of the of the of the trials and troubles we get ourselves into how many times does he do it we think about his name how many times we think upon his name he hearkens to us with eagerness or curiosity to attend to regard to give heed to what is uttered to observe or obey to listen to attend to Grant or comply with the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord I can't help but think that that that this is exactly a type of the story of Esther and how King ahasurus had a book of remembrance written about the events that happened in his day-to-day life and how one time it was brought to his attention through the reading of that book that Mordecai actually saved his life Mordecai did something for him you know he was rewarded for it but just to think that this is exactly in line with that story and it's exactly in line with our lives a book of remembrance is written about us is tremendous just tremendous every time we gather together and talk about his name even more so as we see the day approaching every time we call one another on the phone even more so as we see the day approaching there's a book of remembrance written before him tonight I want to carry on with church order and I just have a different little bit of a different quote that I want to read tonight and uh I heard something just profound this week that just I just have to say it because really what we're talking about here is having a church that follows the doctrine of Paul that follows the doctrine of William Miriam Branham that follows the doctrine of the Pentecostal fathers that they will change the heart of the children that has already turned the hearts of the children back to that Pentecostal faith and not a Pentecostal Doctrine but a Pentecostal experience the true experience of the Holy Ghost and you know brothers and sisters we have authority and and I don't think we need to live below our privilege we need to live right up to our privilege and I think the more that we actually talk about these things the more the book of remembrance is going to be written about us the more angels are going to attend our way because we're actually confessing the truth about who we are and the authority that we have imagine if we never confess the truth about the authority that we have brother Bradham says God can't do anything for you unless you first confess it we need to make sure that we confess it so anyways when I was growing up I remember our pastor Lucas saying at the end of the service you know he'd say God bless you the Lord keep you or whatever go on and be a nuisance to the devil I always thought it was kind of a joke you know going to be a nuisance to the devil how do you do that the devil's a nuisance to us well here we have a prophet in our day saying that you don't need to be a nuisance to him you can actually be thunder to the devil says all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices so we could just take that out and say how we need in Calgary how we need in Canada how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish can you imagine that can we live up to that you know we we can't on our own but if we can just accept what his word says about us and come his provided way then we fit that description exactly brothers and sisters exactly that description he says yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or Shout but this is what caught me was this statement right here he says but what hurts the devil how many wants to hurt the devil but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on he says oh my that throws him away that shakes that's the Thunder that shakes the devil brothers and sisters we're talking about a glorious church here in Calgary Alberta without spot or wrinkle this isn't Calgary living words church this isn't brother Barry's church this isn't any man's church this is the Church of the Living God the mystical body of Jesus Christ he's doing his work here through every single one of us and when we can come according to the word that he has given us for our day to realize that we truly are that Sanctified bride Justified Sanctified filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters two omnipotents when they come together that's deity in flesh that becomes God you are a son of God his Spirit comes down upon you it's no longer you it's no longer just him it's it's it's together as one when you speak he speaks but you know the Devil comes around and says well you said that before and it didn't work so you know why would you say that again why would you have that confession again it just didn't work out the way you thought that it should he's not interested in in our opinions about maybe what what's gone on or hasn't gone on he just wants us to confess it brothers and sisters but imagine you know in this quote if you look it up it's in Revelation um part four uh Revelation chapter four sorry part three in 1961. um I would say look it up if if you feel inclined it's powerful before and after the quote that I just read um if you were to just look up What Hurts The Devil it'll bring it up just like that think about that What Hurts The Devil think about how the devil just loves to hurt us What Hurts The Devil brothers and sisters it's that sweet consecrated life it's not screaming and shouting it's not pouring oil on people it's it's not doing all of the religious motions it's living a sweet consecrated life so that people in this world can see Jesus Christ on Earth in flesh we've said it before that our children they need to see God in flesh they don't need to see a traditional form of worship they don't need to see us just come to church and go home come to church and go home come to church and go home and every time it's the same thing nothing ever changes it's always the same it's not that no we need to show our children that we serve a living God that he is alive and well and where is he he's in us he's not just somewhere else he's not in a geographical location he hasn't hallowed any ground even though I stand corrected he did Hollow some ground one time for Moses he told him kick off your shoes because the ground that you stand on is hallowed but it didn't stay that way did it it was only in that moment while he was there that that ground was hallowed but you know brothers and sisters everywhere you walk is Hallowed Ground if you have his spirit in you you set an atmosphere in your life to the people around you oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil it's that consecrated life it's understanding that his Spirit living out through us it does something and Satan is going to do everything in his power to try and make us believe that nothing is changing nothing is changing he's not scared he's not afraid and he's not because of fervent prayers and he's not afraid because we know all the quotes and he's not afraid because we know all the scriptures what he is afraid of is if we can live the life that is what it comes down to brothers and sisters tonight we're talking about church order like I said we're going to try and wrap it up I just wanted to set that sort of bar for the service tonight because I believe we're going higher we're going to go farther we're going to move on from just talking about church order to seeing his life living out through us because that's the key that's the critical Factor if he doesn't we don't have his life living out through us then what are we doing we have to see his life living out through us and and we have a specific order in the church and that's why we've talked about this there's a very specific order um you know if somebody's gonna buy a house they need to go and and do an inspection on the house and just make sure that everything is fine and and you know airplanes before you fly them every single time you have to do a little inspection just to make sure that everything is there all the nuts and bolts are tight everything looks in order you have to go through the checklist to make sure that everything is right before you you fly your pre-flight you know brothers and sisters in the church I think it's worth our while to make sure that everything that we do people that don't understand why so that's why we're doing this and and hopefully we can just move on from this this whole Theory tonight Lord willing you know we're talking about our church being an Apostolic church with an Apostolic blessing understanding the same life that the apostles lived when Jesus was here those those men that walked around who we look at and maybe classify as Heroes you know the the two that went up to the gate beautiful and said to the the beggar Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee I have the Holy Ghost and I'm willing to impart it to you just rise up and walk you know brothers and sisters that's what we're talking about we're not talking about the form and and looking good and acting good and speaking good and and having everything set just in order because we live in in a really good church and we attend a church and it's an association it's not about that it's about understanding that we might look like Fanatics to people the way we worship the way in which you call heresy that's how I worship God brothers and sisters it's not about perfect form what it's about is having his life live out through us and when his life lives out through us we are going to look like Heretics we're not going to look like normal people the apostles when they or the 120 when they came out of that room the upper room they were stumbling around and and the normal people in the world seemingly normal we're calling them drunk people seeing it was the ninth hour of the day and they had already been into the wine they were stumbling around like drunks being formal you know what that we know what that says sorry what the uh the Bible says is that the laodicean church will be lukewarm formal and Powerless and the Antichrist spirit will creep into the church causing it to be so brothers and sisters if we're lukewarm we need to get hot or we need to get cold is what the word says the laodicea the word to the land of the sea in churches I would that you were hot or that you were called but because you're neither I'm just going to spew you out because you're lukewarm and you make me sick we don't want to be that way I don't even want to be talking this way forgive me I I don't know why it goes that way forgive me we want we want to be an Apostolic Church living an Apostolic blessing not talking about it that's what it comes down to tonight we want to be living that Apostolic blessing showing the world around us Jesus Christ with flesh on him there's no members as joiners remember we've talked about all these I'm just gonna go many membered body is what we're talking about not joiners we don't hand out membership cards you can't tithe your way into the church you can't say that I want to do something great for the church and that you'll just put my name on the book The Only book there is here in this church is this book right here and if you can come to this church and hear the message of the hour then your name is already on the book brother and sister it's not something you can do it's the many membered body the mystical body of Jesus Christ is what we're talking about and you know what all people are welcome here there's nobody that's excluded from here we haven't excluded anybody the only people that don't come here are the ones that don't want to for whatever their reason and that's their reason that's fine but you know what everyone is welcome here this this business of it being us for and no more that's that's not here that's not here this is an occult to say that unless you wear a skirt you're not welcome here or or if you're a man and you come here wearing shorts you'll be turned away at the door you know what you need to become come in and get Washed by the Water of the word when Jesus came he didn't come to the most religious people wearing all the clergy clothes and and all of the the Royal apparel he came to the Sinners and the publicans the people that were hated of the day we need to make sure that we have that attitude brothers and sisters we could have some maybe call it greasy and grimy people come through the door but they're the ones that need this gospel they're the ones that need to be washed I was once were you people here are welcome that us for a no more mentality if somebody comes to the door and they're they're they're not wearing a skirt deacons I just want to say this in front of everyone let them in I don't want to hear that someone gets turned away from that maybe if someone is drunk and unruly you know brother Bradham talks about it in this message if that's the case then we need to do something about it but you know what people need to come in they need to be welcomed here anything that would act differently than that brothers and sisters I'll say this from the pulpit it's an antichrist spirit remember the disciples they were commissioned to go out and heal the sick raise the Dead cast out devils but there was one that just couldn't they just couldn't deal with but it's because they weren't converted brothers and sisters we're converted we don't have to tolerate Satan we can Thunder out that life today we have the entire person of Jesus Christ the fullness of the word the ability to speak the word I'm just wrapping up here it's kind of exciting to see that we've made it through this here it's the ability to speak the word brothers and sisters and understand that as he would speak the word not as we would speak the word not as we carnally think about the word and want to present the word sometimes many times in our lives it's not like that it's understanding that we don't need to take thought for what we'll say because that word that inner teacher that that Spirit of truth that will lead us into all truth he'll speak at the right time the right word not just most of the time but every single time every time in our lives to this age brothers and sisters have you heard it said before that you are all this world will ever see of Christ I said it that way and I'll say it again just because it's so incredibly powerful that you and I are all this world will ever see of Christ until Revelations 19. and you know the the verse 18 here in Malachi says then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked he's speaking of Revelations 19 when that bride comes back with him we are all that this world will see of Jesus Christ brother Branham says in 1951 think about how early in his ministry he's talking this way the resurrection of Lazarus and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man Hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God said nothing impossible with you if you'll believe not with God but with you this is what brother Bradham is saying this is a direct quote of his deities in man the fairy God God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity so where's Jesus Christ today brothers and sisters what happened in 1963 why is there such a conflict around the cloud why is there so much controversy around all the seals being opened and and some of them not being open and so on and so forth why is there so much controversy about that these people that come in and around the message and they just don't have the ears to hear or the eyes to see this is what the prophet was saying in 1951. and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are he says it might choke you but study it over that a little while see he is God dwells in man and man becomes the Son of God not him and himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is God there he is imagine that brothers and sisters then stand there with an unwavering Faith just like Abraham you know I just love how the word says it that he's staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong he was of good courage he was strong in the faith that God had given him I heard a brother say it recently and I thought it was so amazing you know when David was anointed by Samuel to be king over Israel he knew he caught a revelation that he was anointed to be king and Imagine This when he went out to see his brothers who are on the front lines of the army and that giant Philistine was down there Beacon off at the army of the Living God on on on the Holy Ground on on Israel's Promised Land here's this giant down there acting out acting the way he was and David said you know what I can't believe that you guys are allowing this to happen step aside and let me go down there I'll go deal with him or this brother say it and and I don't know if brother Bradham says it and you know forgive me for even saying it but I believe it because this is a message brother believer a preacher he said that you know when David went out there he had such Revelation about what was going to happen that if if Goliath killed him if he died God would have been obligated to raise him up instantly because he wasn't anointed to go and kill a giant he was anointed to be king and he wasn't yet King what a thought brothers and sisters until your time is done you have been anointed to be a son and daughter of God and there's no devil that can stand in your way until you fulfill the purpose that God has called you for it just brought such encouragement to me to think about that until God is done with me on this Earth whether I go to the Grave or whether I go to the sky it doesn't matter I've been ordained to do something for him but then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is God there he is my goodness there he stands oh isn't he wonderful I got one more quote and we'll close it tonight there he stands and I guess I'm I'm throwing these in because it's beyond Church order now now we're talking about why we have church order why we try and do things the way we do according to the prophet of our day and so that we can see that Apostolic blessing and understand the authority by which we stand there's people out there now that are preaching this Authority but they're not receiving the message of the hour and you know what's going to happen to those people they're going to be the five foolish virgin they're still virgin they're still for God but they're just not totally getting the whole picture and probably it's not because of something that they've done they just haven't been given ears to hear but there's people preaching Authority this level of authority out there the brothers and sisters when you can understand it that that it's actually Christ Living out through you it's not just an authority that Christ gave you and you can just grab on to it like something that you get from him and then just go and wave it around and get the excitement going and and push back the devils and have conquering Powers it's not about that at all it's not waving a little wand it's speaking the word it's it's Christ Living in US speaking the word forward knowing that there is a full authority of that one that rolled the worlds off his hands from the eternities is now living in US my out of Patmos Vision now man I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it I love this man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is you could look up that that quote right there you don't believe it but he is or just simply man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet he says I'll call the musicians as we as we finish off here what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together two omnipotents some things got to shake imagine that brothers and sisters when that happens that causes that sweet life it just does we just can't live a different life and even if we get upset with someone we might go and talk to them and say you know my brother forgive me for for maybe saying this or asking this and I and I don't want to upset you but I just have this or that or whatever and and it's not coming Gruff we don't go and attack each other but it's that Spirit we're talking about that life living out through us what happens when the two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to shake and you know what's going to shake brothers and sisters it's going to be the devil because it's that life that lives out through us that sweet Pure undefiled Life our words they're kind one to another they're encouraging they're exhorting one another even more so as we see that day approaching we're not slaying each other we're slaying Giants by the life we're living that life is thundering out and hurting the Devils around us getting the devil so he doesn't even know what to do with us pushing us so far back in behind the hedge of God in behind that hedge that job lived in Bush of us so far back in there that the devil can't even find us because of that life we live he goes on to say some whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met when he truly comes into a son and daughter of God it's no longer just us speaking and I believe that really the the true test for us as Sons and Daughters of God is being able to surrender our will so that our voice isn't the one that's speaking it's so that it's the Lord Jesus speaking before our carnal nature can get out before that old nature that is always just constantly behind us haunting us for all of our days before that nature can speak we surrender our will and and and say be it unto me according to thy will Lord and and and just speak through me and when that happens I I truly believe it and I hope that somehow these words will encourage every one of us to know that we're going to be pushing Devils Back not because we're interested in trying to go to war and and and do something fancy or fun that's not what we're talking about we're talking about living up to our potential living up to our privilege not being slapped around by Devils but by just going forward with full confidence knowing that we are omnipotent that's what the prophet said we are omnipotent his voice in US means that we are omnipotent means that there's nothing that can't be done anything that we say will be done that's what his word said don't doubt in your heart speak it and don't doubt it in your heart and it shall be done our purpose here brothers and sisters stand with me tonight this church here in Calgary Calgary Living Word is dedicated to exalting the Lord Jesus Christ on Earth here again today one day I know every one of us will go and give an account for the parts that we play and I just want to say it with my voice today this church here is dedicated to exalting the Lord Jesus Christ to the absolute highest level that we can do it brothers and sisters that's why we gather here that's why we have Calgary Living Word it's to exalt Jesus Christ by hearing what the spirit saith unto the church and how do we hear that Spirit by listening to what the prophet had to say every single age that had a prophet the people that listened to the prophet they lived the people that didn't listen to The Prophet they perished and that's the way God's program works we exalt Jesus Christ by listening to what the prophet said it gives us the ability to set the church in order to have proper functioning Church order so that we can see the Lord prosper in our services prosper in our lives that's why we've gone through this these many services I trust that somehow some way it's been a blessing and that we could potentially see not not something change because something's broken but just see growth spiritually speaking that's all we're trying to do is encourage that we strive to see the fullness of Christ in our lives and we strive to preach the word the fullness of the word for our day that's the purpose of us being here in this church brothers and sisters is to hear the fullness of the word for our day you know it's Colossians one it's it's first Colossians 27 Christ in you the hope of glory to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory that's the reason we gather here we want to see that that mystery revealed in in you revealed in me revealed in US his inheritance let's go to him in prayer gracious Lord Jesus tonight we just thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for your word tonight
