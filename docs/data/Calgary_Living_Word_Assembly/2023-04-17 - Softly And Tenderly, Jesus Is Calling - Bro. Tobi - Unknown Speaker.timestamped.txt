[0:03] God bless you
[0:07] um last week when we were at brother
[0:09] clary's church I was speaking and it was
[0:12] one of those moments like for the
[0:14] brambles say he was coming fresh and and
[0:18] the Lord was just making us to realize
[0:20] that
[0:21] there was a time when the blood of bulls
[0:24] and Rhymes and goats was what was God's
[0:27] provided way
[0:29] but God knowing that that will not bring
[0:33] the believer to perfection
[0:35] he made sure that he came in flesh to
[0:38] die for us and I was saying that
[0:41] it's it's a discredited to the blood of
[0:44] Jesus
[0:45] if we live a double life
[0:48] is it discredits the blood of Jesus if
[0:50] we come and accept this and go back with
[0:53] the consciousness of sin
[0:55] and I just want to sing this song this
[0:57] morning it's titled Softly and Tenderly
