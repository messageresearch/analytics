they have a baby on the way and you know they had applied three years ago to come to Calgary to immigrate here and they found out on the 22nd of October I believe it is that they were approved to come

Jesus name [Music] we are standing In God's Presence on Holy Ground one more time is a declaration tonight [Music] this is Jesus now [Music] it is let us pray our most gracious Heavenly and loving father those are not just the words we are singing because you have given us bread but it is true we are standing on a Holy Ground we know we are in your presence father Lord Jesus when one time your Prophet Moses came in your presence you told him to remove the shoes because the place where he was standing was a holy crowd when Elijah the prophet came in your presence he felt so much unworthy until he cried well unto me but Heavenly Father you have brought us your presence you have counted us worthy to be partakers of your blessings and even that's the reason you have brought us into this Sanctuary for one purpose that is to worship you may you accept our worship Lord Jesus Christ may you take now control of the meeting from now up to the end so that Lord Jesus Christ father when we leave this place may we have a testimony that surely God has spoken to me we need you Lord I need you Heavenly Father even as I stand before your children who have defied the odds of the weather to come unto this Sanctuary Lord Jesus I know because they are hungry they want to be fed Lord Jesus let me not be a hindrance for them to receive what thou has purposed for them to receive father now I commit the service in your hands we return it back to you father because you have given it unto us I also commit myself in your hands a lot may you just borrow my lips heavenly father and use them for their glory and honor to your name now as we go to read your word may you give us the understanding of the scriptures that we are going to read further blessed and Sanctified Lord as we commit all things now to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray thank you musicians are you happy to be in the house of the Lord sometimes how God works the song our brother led us to sing of would you be free from the burden of sin that was to be my my closing song [Laughter] so anyway we thank God for everything let's turn to our Bibles Deuteronomy chapter 15. Deuteronomy chapter 15. we rate verse 1 and verse 2. then we will also read from Leviticus chapter 25 verse 8 and 9. if you are there you can say Amen okay good at the end of every seven years thou shall make a release and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbor shall release it he shall not exert it of his neighbor or of his brother because it is called the Lord's release Leviticus 25 verse 8 and 9. amen and thou shall number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years in the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shall thou cause the trumpet of the tupilitu sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall I make the trumpet sound throughout all your land now that verse 9 we are connecting it with Revelation 10 7. you can take your seats okay now I've called it the title of my sermon breaking from the wrong cycle but uh the scripture where we read it talks about the Lord's release now other versions like if you have NIV it says debt cancellation so whatever whatever situation that fits you you can put yourself there if it is debt consolidation you can call it debt consolation if it is loads release you can say I'm free then if the breaking out of the psycho fits you you can put yourself there but I've called it breaking out of the wrong cycle now there has never been a time in life that people have dates like now maybe you might say oh me I don't have any debt we have cleared everything wait ever a newborn baby the moment the moment the child receives the first breath the next is to receive the debt that will be paid in lifetime in times of taxes under levies I'll support it with a quote nations are in-depth even Canada even the superpower the superpower the prophet says in the message the stage of a perfect man this present government now is spending money for what for tax money that they will pay collecting for 40 years from now that was 1962. now if 1962 they had debts that they were to pay in 40 years that is U.S what about Canada but I may not allow me to talk about the other countries amen so now if the whole world is in debt who is the owner of the depth there must be sample there must be somebody controlling amen now the prophet says the Beast who owns the cold of the world will put the world in a debt trap so the honor of the depth is the Beast and he owns the code of the world now spiritually speaking that should be a sign that human beings are Also spiritually indebted and that's now the line we are going now many things life or you worry about they have nothing to do with you but you are servicing a depth of somebody Numbers Chapter 14 verses 18. let's read it as I try to build my thought numbers 14. verse 18. the Lord is long-suffering and of great Mercy for giving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the thought under the fourth generation so the problem that you might be going through it is not yours you are servicing the debt that was committed by somebody in your lineage if you have a temper that you cannot control it is not you it is not your fault you are servicing a debt that was committed by somebody in your in your lineage and that's why it calls now for the New Path and the reason Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again so that you change the lineage so that you come to a point where you can break the cycle and it can be done amen everything that you cry about or that and Christianity that that that makes you to makes you to unchristianize yourself you didn't do it you are just servicing the depth of somebody somebody in your lineage the scripture has said that he will take the iniquities and therefore up to the third under the fourth generation we come to it in a minute oh my now but you are true nature is a predestinated seed of God that jumped from the mind of God by by passing the theophany but now it is being delivered back to you Hallelujah the seed is now being delivered back to you so what is the greatest what is the cause of the the depth it is hybriding the way we came we came the wrong way and that's why you need to be born again amen now if somebody comes and fixes your hybriding then what happens the dates are canceled if you can fix your path then the dates are canceled let me put it this way if you discover today that you belong to a country that has no debt yeah if you discover today that you belong to a country that has no debt what will happen all the debts that you have they will be counseled because you don't belong to this country you belong to the other country that has no debts and we have our country we have our home where we have no debts amen so the moment you discover that you belong to another citizens to another country you are the citizen of another country the moment you discover that Discovery we are calling it a revelation yeah when it is revealed to you that this world is not your home you belong to another country then that consoles all the debts that you have and you can say I am free so you need to you need to remember where you came from little oh my God may God help us so we are protect of the spoken word we are products of the spoken one so that is how now our genealogy you can now address your genealogy from from the beginning from the mind of God you can trace your genealogy and say I was in the mind of God I was the change in the mind of God I bypass the theophany but now the theophany has come back to open itself so that I become now this your funny that I pay fast in the mind we were both thoughts in the mind of God With Jesus Christ him he came from the thought he came to the theophany from the theophany he came into the flesh but for our case we bypass the theophany we come direct into the flesh but now that theophany that we bypass has now come and that's why we say we are hearing from our Theo families don't worry I've not started my subject okay God help us he died in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed he died in order to pay the debt of your high breeding my my there it is what it is that you could die to yourself until you are no more yourself and be filled with his word believing his word then the holy spirit that was in him comes down to water that word that make that will make it to grow man I say it was I say it on Sunday somewhere that uh if you are accused today of being a Christian can they find something in you to convict you the life that you live if you are accused of being a Christian can they find something to convict you because it's more than wearing a long dress it's more it's more than carrying these message books can they find something to convict you can somebody preach with me can they find something to convict you I'll leave it for you to do to you to do it yourself amen okay I'll just try to summarize because I have a lot the pastor says you see if you keep these guys for so long they accumulate too much if they don't release [Music] now you could not access your home that is Canon or a true baptism of the Holy Ghost but now it has been made possible by Crossing Jordan that is the opening of the seals foreign has one job and that is to water the word so what am I trying to say take the word have something in you what is that something the word when you have the word and the spirit comes it comes to water the word but what if you don't have the word when the spirit comes and it doesn't find the word it makes you just a religious a religious and religious something that cannot produce the Life of Christ may God help us so the question is how often do you read the word and how men are here that reads the word every day I was looking I was I was trying to look for that quote then yesterday I was listening to them I was listening the message the lamp and the Dove and then that quote came that you need to read the Bible at least a chapter in the morning and a chapter in the evening before you sleep that's the prophet how men are doing that that's the prophet that's like what God help us so you need to have the word so that when the spirit comes it quickens to bring now to life that word that is in you mark that statement will come to eat you must have something so when you take the word and hide it in your heart then it comes the Holy Spirit comes to water it this could not happen now let's we come now to our subject this could not happen in the seven Church ages so I I don't there's no need to repeat it there is church now the year of release could not be declared during the time of the seven Church ages we read the Scripture it says after seven years or after seven Church ages now he shall declare the Lord's release so the Lord's release has come after the church ages so to which means during the church ages the Lord's release could not be pronounced during the church edges the year the sounding of the Jubilee for your freedom was not pronounced until after the church ages may God help us we will see it in a minute so it could not happen during the church edges this after the charge edges now the Lord comes and declares the year of release now after he has declared the year of release now you can say I am free but you must see it accept it and believe it [Applause] it must become a revelation to you once it has been revealed to you now you can say I see okay amen now the reason we can go free is very simple is because we have been placed here at the time of the Lord's release God help us okay now Jehovah waited until Jordan was Jordan was flooding for him to make a way for his children to cross he waited until your spiritual debt is overflowing then he comes and declares the Lord's release okay the release was if you are an Israelite Forerunner Israelite you had to work until you pay the debt in full or until that you believe is declared but for the other fellows who could not who are not Israelites they were to be taken as Bond slaves I believe I'm speaking to the spiritual Israelites unto whom the Year of Jubilee has been announced and the sound the trumpet sound has sounded so when you hear the trumpet sound not with his ears amen you can sit here you can stay here for years and say I've been a Believer for 20 30 50 years but until it becomes a spiritual revelation then you say I see I am free may God help us amen so when the release is being announced it is not for everybody is for them that will hear we used to sing a song in Sunday School that when he comes he doesn't scoop or shovel he picks he said it now he's selecting those who are his so how is he selecting he comes and flashes before your eyes your citizenship when you say you are citizenship then you denounce the citizens the citizenship of the country that you are in we are not of this world so what he does he flashes before your eyes that's it your citizenship may God help us so he's on he has announced the year of release you can be debt free debt free right now if your eyes can be opened to see it amen okay after the church edges are over and the true seat has come through the shark at the Pentecostals The Remnant called through the message charge God is not going to rupture the message charge but he is going to Rapture his own seats you carry the message books and say we belong to the message Church no he is not coming to Rapture The Message Church he's coming to select his own seeds by flashing before them they sit their citizenship may God open my eyes to see my citizenship in the message desperation the prophet says the devil can impersonate any of those things but he cannot be the Holocaust oh yeah he can impersonate these gifts but he can't be the Holocaust and the Holocaust is the token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood all the way from your Redemption and now I'm still quoting from the message desperations and now the entire holy spirit beasts the church making God in human flesh all that he hasn't done through the church ages in the he is now doing back to the world because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire world and in the last days the Seven Seals be the Seven Seals being opened was to pick up every struggles that has been left off of in it and make the whole thing in one great big body The Pride amen now the devil cannot be our depth release if anything he's the owner of the Dead so what he will what what he will do he wants to make sure you feel comfortable but you are under him he doesn't want to release you it reminds me what I was preaching sometimes somewhere about captivity you can come from this captivity and you enter into another captivity if you are not careful it happened with the children of Israel they came from captivity in Egypt but then they found themselves in another captivity in papyrone so you can come from the world that is one captivity and you come into the church and become under another another captivity but the genuine children of God are praising on every day you are hungering you are fasting you are crying you are not satisfied with yourself I'm not satisfied with what I am I I need more I want more your cry is you are crying every day you stand before the mirror every morning every time you start before the mirror and say Lord help me I want to achieve this God help us oh my okay Luke Chapter 4 verses 18. okay I'll just okay let's let's read it I want to come to the point where we will see Who We Are amen Luke chapter 4 verse 18. the Bible says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are poised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord that was Jesus Christ he was to preach the acceptable here but that year did not come at that time it came after the seventh judge ages that's when now God has come to declare the Lord's release then we must be special people brethrens that we are living at the time when God has declared here the year of release so you can go free you can be free if you allow the word to come God help us oh he came to heal the process what are the process the wounds regrets some complexes that we have may God help us I wish we had time to go back to that that sermon of complexes so that we see how how how how we have complexes in our lives hey hey man okay in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled paragraph 46 the prophet says the acceptable year we we as we all know as Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and the prisoners as they were been taken prison and had to give a son to pay adept or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of that you believe when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free you are free when they to believe sounded when that trumpet sounded you live whatever you are doing even if your boss had sent you to the farm and you are there whatever you are doing once you hear the trumpet you want to leave everything that you are you are doing and say I am free you can no longer take his instructions where are you going I am free [Applause] remember we said who is the owner of the Dead Saturn so if you have been under his captivity and you hear that trumpet sound for your release you leave everything that you are doing don't carry anything that he might he might follow me and ask no no no no don't carry everything read everything there start running you are free God help us okay what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it is preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how it is far how far you have stopped in sin or what is wrong with you you can go free when you hear the trumpet sounds amen okay now when the man is truly in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed remember we are following that seed yeah so listen when and when man is truly redeemed that pretestinated seed that is that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished when you see it and accept it your sins are when you see it and accept it your sins are demolished where are they taken in the sea of forgetfulness let some brothers and start some sisters try fishing fishing them out oh you know you did this you know you did this I it's no it's not counted on me the Lord doesn't remember so if you see it and accept it your sins are demolished if right now you can see it and accept it you are still your sins will be demolished then you can say I'm free would you be free from your burden of oh my goodness okay now oh sorry oh my goodness now if your sins have been demolished then you are the person who has Saturn's answer you have an answer to the devil's question now what is the devil's question who is this you can live a life until the devil asks who is this because you are not you are it is not you you died to yourself Christ took over so as the day as they asked at that time who is this who are they asking they were asking about Jesus Christ so today you can also live our life until the devil will be asking who is this and that's why the prophet says we have an answer to the devil's question if you have accepted if you sow your name if you had there to be this sound and you say I am free then you can now live the life oh my okay Revelation chapter 3. verses 18 we do not read Because of time I want to finish somewhere so the Bible says come and buy now and a business to do with the buying or selling it has to involve two people some transactions has to take place now what is the transaction because he says comment by by of me called yeah I solve that your eyes may be opened so you need to buy now the I self to apply to your eyes why because Jesus Christ said he came to preach to the blind to Open the Eyes of the blind now the Year of Jubilee the year of the Lord's release is to open your eyes and how are your eyes opened your eyes are opened by the revelation of the Seven Seals The Mystery of the book we are not now preaching the mystery it has been revealed why to open your eyes for what so that you can see yourself that you are in God's mind oh my may God help us may my eyes be opened so that I can see where I am you can now dress you are genealogy and say I thought I did come from Africa no I came from God's mind and that's where I'm going oh my okay oh yes come in Dubai what happens the transaction is done now you can say it is done that great transactions done I am my Lord and He is mine he drew me and I followed on come to confess oh my goodness my brothers from Africa when you talk about being Charmed they understand better you are jumped I am jumped to confess what happened I I can't help myself he did something for me that I can't help myself to confess his love divine I can't help myself God help us oh yes so when the Devil comes and says you are a liar oh you remember the other day what you did then he's a liar himself God doesn't see he doesn't remember if you had it and if you had the year off to believe the trumpet sound being pronounced oh my okay in the message thou no waste all things it is in me eternal life now we are the sons of God not we will be I expected a very big amen but because of the depth of the dead is so big sometimes even when you are told you are now you are a son of God you say me oh my God to help us okay let's start to I have to second Kings chapter four I have to finish as we turn to Second Kings yeah brothers and sisters let us eat the word okay Second Kings chapter 4. okay now they are great a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets and Elijah saying they servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be born to men remember we said the prophet said they were to pay with yourself you are to pay with your sons or your daughters to pay the debt yeah so now here it is being applied this woman comes to Elijah and says that credit my husband died you know and he left some depth and now the Creditor has come to claim my sons to pay for those debts you can now get it huh that at that time as they come to auction they will not only auction your car you have your house and everything but they also auction your children so that's why it was the concern of this woman and she went to Elisha are we together now okay let's continue and Elijah said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what has thou in the house one Elijah was the spirit of Elijah in the presence of in the absence of Elijah Elijah was the voice of Elijah in the present in the absence of Elijah I want this one to sing Elisha was The Voice of Elijah in the absence of Elijah we have Malachi 4. the prophet of Malachi 4 Elijah the prophet now in his absence the voice is still on [Laughter] the voice of Elijah is still on now Elijah was the voice of Elijah in the absence of Elijah now this woman went to Elijah now she presented her case okay now Elijah asks her what do you have what do you have you must have something and that's why I say it earlier on take the word eat the word so that when you are asked what do you have what do you have I have hit Thy word in my heart that is what I have so this woman was asked by Elijah what do you have tell me what has now in the house and she said thine handmade hath not anything in the House serve a pot of oil can you imagine you have a debt remember we say it all that is all that is happening in your life you are paying the debt of somebody now this woman was found was found herself in a situation where she has to pay the debt of the husband you are paying the debt of somebody so she found herself in a situation where she had to pay the debt of her husband and because she was a neighbor and that's why she went to there she went to Elisha now Elijah maybe let's say she had two million the debt was to the deputy was 2 million and now Elijah asks her what do you have in the house what you have can save you what do you have At first she said I have nothing there is a comma there and the last time I preached here I said when it comes to the Bible when it comes to God even akoma can mean something different can change the situation so there is a comma there so after she said the handmaid has nothing then she remembered she has some little oil then she said accept okay no no no no no set your mind now to to to to receive the miracle after she said she had just but a little oil then the prophet said then he said Go parody vessels up vessels are brought of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few now I just have she said I just have a little oh yeah then the prophet says go and the borrowed vessels and not just a few borrow bring them why a miracle was going to happen but he never told her that America was going to happen what she needed to do was to obey the voice of the prophet now we have said we are living in the day of The Voice so obey what the voice tells you to do so after she after she will obeyed the voice of the prophet let's see what what happened okay verse 4 and when thou art come come in thou shall shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shall set aside that which is full oh my goodness shut yourself in the house there's that song we usually chatting with it Jesus chatting with God so the prophet is telling her shutting the house listen to the message listen to the to the this listen to listen to the tips shouting listen listen to the tips not just one listen then what happened after they shot him and listened and obeyed the voice of the Prophet what happened they started the oil started multiplying I can imagine the neighbors who entered them the vessels what is happening these people have been so poor and what is happening and why were they borrowing the vessels but now we can see vessels being taken out full of oil full of oil full of oil whatever that was being happy whatever that was happening in private in the closet now the testimony where that came out was different if you shot in my brother if he was chatting and I'll pay the boys when you come out the results will be different the neighbors will have a different testimony may God help us are we ready to listen to The Voice the voice is on the Run the voices on the land our limitation is listening to The Voice may God help us so poro not just a few bottle I can imagine the neighbor saying what is happening is there a factory in this house they didn't know what was happening but by shutting themselves inside and obeying the voice of the Prophet a miracle happened we want Miracles but we don't want to obey the voice God help us amen now Elijah had the anointing of canceling the debts let's read to the next verse okay verse 5. so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she brought out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil State then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay the debt foreign we are talking about debt consolation she had the depth that was not hers but now the voice of the Prophet provided a solution go under sir pay off the debt and live on what remains we can visit free from the depth we can be set free if we can obey the voice of the prophet in the absence of Elijah the prophet we have the spirit of Elijah we have the voice on depths we have the voice on depths and and books the limitation is the limitation is you what help us so the voice of the prophet has the power to cancel your debts whatever depth you have the voice of the Prophet has the power to cancel all your attempts and you can be free the limitation is you don't blame the pastor don't foreign it is you the prophet asked her what do you have in the house remember I asked that question if you are if you are accused of being a Christian can they find something that they can convict you with yeah so here the prophet said what do you have in the house what do you have we have books on the shelves or maybe you can say Okay I I have nothing but at least I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then the prophets oh that is our Goods so you are half obeyed ABS 2 38. then already that is a good step oh yes oh what do you have in the house at least I created time to listen to the message at least I create time to read a scripture that is what you have and you have it you have it even in your on your phones you can listen so that when you are asked what do you have at least you can quote something that you had yesterday or at least you can quote a scripture that you had yesterday you read yesterday or even today may God help us our prayer lives are limited because we don't listen to the message what happens listen to it listen even if it comes it condemns you listen listen anyhow let it condemn you that is the voice of the trumpet for your release sleep on it even if you are not hearing what it is what whatever that is being said just put it on it creates an atmosphere listen to it it will change our time will come when you can say I've heard but now I see then you can say my eyes have been opened I have seen my year of release the Lord has declared unto me the year of release now I am free I am no longer slave whatever situation you can say I am free and you can be free why that's why God has sent the voice has sent us the message to declare our freedom if you are if you hear it accept it what happens all your sins are demolished yes and they are taking in the sea of forgetfulness or you can sight me around you can turn me up upside down trying to to to to to to to fish those sins or anything that you know about me you can try always to to fish them so that you publish them and this is the only time the voice The Voice has said you never sinned even in the first place why because of the Lord's release the Lord's release has come in our day for what to declare that you are free your freedom has come so your freedom is here now it is your responsibility you take it or you reject it if you reject it you are marked as a bonded person you will remain there you can be in the church you remain in the church but you are already upon that person but you can up if he or if God can open you up your eyes to see your freedom then now you can declare I am free I am free God bless you let's stand oh my God you asked me why I am happy are there people who are happy this evening is there somebody who is happy you can join me to sing you ask me why I'm happy because my sins are gone oh when they tell when the devil tries to tempt me and asks where they are I say they are my sins are gone we can sing and shout because our sins are gone why because the Lord has declared the year of release you accept it you are set free you reject it you are you remain as a slave you remain as a slave of sin remember the devil is there he doesn't want to release you he wants to keep you he can make you a church member a very good church member you never miss to come to church but you are

[Music] good enough for me praise God my sins are gone Hallelujah what a wonderful lesson tonight if we want to be free we can be free that trumpet has sounded you know brother Bradham brings it out so clearly I feel like I could just start right now are we good for an hour why to think about it though when that trumpets blown you're given the opportunity to go free and you can choose to stay sometimes Masters are very nice to the slaves very nice they look after them they look after their children they make Provisions for them sometimes people they just don't want to leave their masters because they're comfortable things are absolutely looked after and you know what brother Branham says we know it's in the Bible if they refuse that trumpet call to refuse that trumpet call means you're taken down to the temple not just anywhere to the temple and you're bored in the ear with an awl to Mark you so that you can never be free from that point forwards and brother Branham says you know what's happening when you hear preaching if you refuse that voice that trumpet call in that voice then you will be spiritually bored in the ear and you will not be able to hear that voice you will remain a Slave if you've heard that voice if you've heard that trumpet brothers and sisters we've got reason to Rejoice tonight Hallelujah let's just bow in prayer tonight our gracious Heavenly
