[37:02] Heavenly Father, Lord,
[37:05] thou alone are worthy. Father,
[37:08] that is our testimony. Father, Lord,
[37:12] we thank you for this day, this
[37:13] opportunity once again, Father, to
[37:15] gather in this manner. Father,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; not so much just in the building, but
[37:19] Lord, that's a part of it. Father, we
[37:21] gather ourselves according to your word,
[37:24] but a true desire in our heart to do it,
[37:25] Father. Not out of tradition, Father.
[37:29] Not of something that we were told we
[37:30] must do, Father. We do it openly,
[37:32] Father. We know this is your word. And
[37:36] Father, we want to apply and fulfill
[37:38] your word in every aspect of our lives,
[37:39] Father. Lord, we stand here today,
[37:42] Father, your purchase, your redeemed,
[37:43] your bride.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; It brings such humility to us, Father.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] to be able to stand here in the last day
[37:52] with a testimony of knowing you
[37:54] personally in our lives. You gave us
[37:56] your word, Father.
[38:00] You made us overcomers by even giving us
[38:02] of yourself, Father.
[38:04] We thank you for this opportunity, Lord.
[38:06] So therefore, we assemble once again,
[38:07] Lord, in your name,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; with the revelation and of
[38:10] understanding, Father, that this is how
[38:12] you spoke it and meant it to be, Father.
[38:14] Lord, and you told us, Lord, all the
[38:16] total obedience to the whole or complete
[38:18] word of God entitles us to your life.
[38:20] Father, we stand here today with a
[38:22] testimony we have your life in us.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; That overcoming power, Lord, not us and
[38:29] our will of ourselves, Father, but by
[38:31] your life, Father. Lord,
[38:33] &gt;&gt; as our brother comes and brings the word
[38:34] of life, Father, Lord, may it find more
[38:36] room in our hearts, Father, Lord, that
[38:38] more of you would come forth, Father.
[38:40] That is what we desire, Lord. We're
[38:42] called for a purpose, Lord, and we want
[38:44] to stand in this day for that purpose,
[38:46] Lord, in every avenue, every aspect of
[38:48] our life, Father. Lord,
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Father, as we come humbly before you to
[38:53] receive of you, Lord, we lift our hands
[38:55] and our mouths and our hearts to worship
[38:57] you, Father, to sing songs, Lord, to
[38:58] give testimonies, Father, of your
[39:01] greatness and your goodness, Father. And
[39:02] as a part of that, Lord, we bring our
[39:04] tithes and our offerings, Lord.
[39:08] Father, may you bless it, Lord. You know
[39:09] the needs of this assembly, the
[39:11] financial needs, Lord, and your body,
[39:12] Father, Lord. But we commit it all into
[39:14] your hands in full faith and full
[39:16] assurance that you will provide a way.
[39:18] In Jesus Christ's name, Lord, we pray.
[39:21] Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; To God

[42:13] church, raised by message good parents,
[42:16] but still had to come to a place.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Where God had to meet him face to face.
[42:23] And each one of us have to go to that
[42:24] place. Right.

[44:53] for you only know.
[44:57] I'm glad you see
[45:02] through us.
[45:06] I was a homeless
[45:10] such a
[45:13] sweet
[45:14] [Music]
[45:34] Thank you, my brother. We have a
[45:35] testimony this morning as well. Could
[45:37] help out with the mic.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Good morning. God bless. Just wanted to
[45:48] take this opportunity to give glory to
[45:51] God as we just sang. Um, for those of
[45:53] you who um know me and have heard my
[45:57] story the last little bit, I've been
[45:58] looking for a car and God provided that
[46:01] car for me um on Friday.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to give a praise
[46:06] report um about the situation around
[46:09] that. And um I'll just I wrote it down
[46:12] so I'll just read it to you. In August
[46:14] of 2024, Brother Jose here, our one of
[46:17] our preachers, um he preached and in
[46:20] that sermon, he encouraged us to pray
[46:22] and ask God for something we've never
[46:24] asked him for before. Something that
[46:26] only God could do for us, as then we
[46:29] would know that had been provided by
[46:31] God. With some thought, I decided to ask
[46:34] for $20,000 off a car in the new year.
[46:37] To me, I thought that was a big ask, a
[46:40] crazy ask. Um, I'd already asked God to
[46:42] watch over my rust bucket of a car, a
[46:44] 2009 Ford Focus with 330,000 km on it.
[46:49] Occasionally, it screeched when I
[46:50] started it, but it always started, and I
[46:52] would praise God every day for that.
[46:54] Although I knew God was going to not
[46:57] going to just drop a car in my yard. I
[46:59] had no savings for this car. By the end
[47:02] of the year, a bathroom renovation,
[47:04] necessary kitchen appliances, and a week
[47:06] of lost income while hospitalized had
[47:08] depleted my daily savings. Despite this,
[47:11] I had paid my thighs and thank God for
[47:13] the opportunity to step out in faith for
[47:15] my finances as I also made a donation to
[47:18] missions. This year, I was able to begin
[47:21] saving money again. I began looking for
[47:23] a vehicle in March and completed my
[47:25] taxes. I also imagined how God was going
[47:28] to answer my prayer. Perhaps it would be
[47:31] a hail damaged car or a demo car, maybe
[47:35] an estate vehicle. I didn't know, but I
[47:37] believed he would answer my prayer. In
[47:40] April or May, I received my tax refund.
[47:43] Due to my charitable donations, it was
[47:45] the largest refund I had ever received.
[47:48] Shortly after, as I balanced my budget,
[47:51] I realized this refund and my new
[47:53] savings were going to add up to 20,000
[47:55] by this summer. I begun to understand
[47:57] that this this is how God was going to
[48:00] answer my prayer.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; And God kept my old rust bucket going.
[48:05] It is almost 360,000 kilometers on it
[48:08] now. And God brought it right up to the
[48:10] possession of a two 2025 Subaru Impreza
[48:13] RS.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God for answered prayers.
[48:25] I just want to also say that I know that
[48:28] some may belittle this, not I don't
[48:29] believe anybody here in church would,
[48:31] but um some may belittle it and state
[48:33] that it's mathematically possible to
[48:34] achieve this considering the factors,
[48:36] but I did not know those factors would
[48:38] play out this way when I said this
[48:39] prayer in August of 2024. I prayed that
[48:42] prayer on a Sunday and I was
[48:45] hospitalized for mental health concerns
[48:46] the following Friday. Satan wanted to
[48:49] squash that prayer, but I'm here to say
[48:50] God answers prayer.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; So, I want to also ask everyone to join
[48:55] me at my car if it's not raining or
[48:57] downstairs. I brought a celebration cake
[48:59] and I think we can all enjoy that
[49:01] together. Thank you very much.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amazing how God works. were talking to
[49:14] our grandkids the other day about things
[49:16] and don't don't hopefully you don't take
[49:18] this wrong sister sister Amber and but
[49:20] little things like it could be
[49:22] considered a little thing. were talking
[49:23] about the possum story and the little
[49:25] puppy that got run over that brother Ram
[49:27] said, "Well, you know, if they said just
[49:28] go shoot it." Well, he said, "No, let's
[49:29] just wait for a bit
[49:30] &gt;&gt; and he ra and the Lord raised those
[49:32] animals up." So, those little things
[49:34] that God does for us, we just appreciate
[49:36] it. I I was telling a few people, I lost
[49:38] my cell phone this past week and it was
[49:40] a bad loss as you know, we live on our
[49:42] phones. SIM cards in there, everything's
[49:44] in there.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; And I asked the Lord, "Lord, would you
[49:47] just show me?" Sorry to don't mean to
[49:49] trump your your testimony, sister, but I
[49:51] I I went right to the He guided me right
[49:53] to the place, pulled aside some bushes
[49:55] and there it was. Like I I said, "Lord,
[49:57] that just that was you. We thank you,
[49:59] Lord."
[50:03] Never quit asking. Never quit asking.
[50:05] Our Lord is an amazing husband, isn't
[50:07] he?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amazing provider. We thank the Lord.
[50:10] Thank you for the special, Brother
[50:11] Justin. That was so so moving to me.
[50:14] It's just by grace we're here. Let's
[50:15] stand. We start a service. Change the
[50:18] order of the service. Uh chorus first.
[50:21] The course, please. the course this
[50:22] morning.
[50:24] Lord, feed your children. Who else would
[50:26] we want to be fed by this morning? He's
[50:28] the fountain of all life. When our
[50:30] brothers come, we certainly appreciate
[50:32] brother Menow and his testimony to
[50:34] stand. He happens to be my uncle on top
[50:35] of it. My one of my favorites is
[50:37] probably my favorite, but I certainly
[50:39] he's my living favorite.
[50:42] Just good to be here in the house of the
[50:43] Lord amongst friends amongst believers.
[50:45] Like brother Mitch said, isn't it
[50:47] amazing that we're going to spend all of
[50:49] eternity with each other? What a what a
[50:51] incredible hope that is and what a
[50:53] blessing. We just thank the Lord for
[50:55] bringing our brother by. Lord, would you
[50:57] feed me this morning? Would you just
[50:58] come by my way? Sing it as a prayer this
[51:01] morning. Well, Lord, feed your children.
[51:07] As we stand
[51:10] here
[51:12] to
[51:14] the table
[51:21] to
[51:24] that mountain
[51:26] and go around the
[51:30] [Music]
[51:37] Let's sing that one more time. Lord,
[51:39] feed your children.
[51:41] Oh Lord, feed your children.
[51:45] Are you willing today?
[51:49] [Music]
[51:59] [Music]
[52:03] the mountain
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] the father.
[52:16] [Applause]
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today.
[52:21] Welcome one more time to the house of
[52:24] the Lord so we can eat at that table. My
[52:27] heart is absolutely full. There's so
[52:29] many visitors here today. I'm just going
[52:31] to say welcome visitors, each and every
[52:34] one of you. God richly bless you all.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; It's tremendous to see everyone and just
[52:39] to know that as we've heard, we're going
[52:42] to spend eternity there. What a blessing
[52:44] that is. My we just uh we had the
[52:48] wedding yesterday for brother Logan Ber
[52:51] and what a tremendous day that was and
[52:54] is as they embark on their new life
[52:57] together. And uh we're certainly looking
[53:00] forward to see what the Lord will do in
[53:01] their life.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; We also want to acknowledge Sister
[53:06] Rebecca Odelene who has gotten married
[53:10] yesterday as well in Nigeria and her
[53:13] sisters traveled this last week to go
[53:16] and celebrate with her. And we know we
[53:18] have been praying for those sisters that
[53:21] they would find husbands that husbands
[53:23] would find them and the Lord has
[53:24] answered prayer.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue praying for the
[53:28] other three sisters. There's four of
[53:29] them in total. That the Lord would just
[53:31] bless them with that abundance of
[53:34] opportunity if he should terry. What a
[53:37] tremendous thing it is. My goodness. I
[53:40] just feel like I could preach today.
[53:42] Just would like to acknowledge brother
[53:44] Dwayne Far, Pastor Saskatoon Tabernacle,
[53:47] Sister Connie. God richly bless you.
[53:49] Welcome sister Irene and brother Menow
[53:52] Fzen, the founders of that church and uh
[53:56] our elder certainly honored and
[53:59] privileged to have him here today to one
[54:01] more time step up to the front line and
[54:05] just allow the Lord to use him for our
[54:07] benefit.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Sister Amber Lassard,
[54:12] God richly bless you and thank you for
[54:14] the testimony. Brother Paul, I believe
[54:16] we could just have a testimony service
[54:17] here this morning and just talk about
[54:19] that third pole power of the almighty
[54:21] God moving in our lives. But
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we want to hear the word. So,
[54:26] if you have a need this morning, let's
[54:28] just go to him in prayer and as we
[54:30] heard, just ask him.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; He's more than able.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father,
[54:36] we're so thankful, Lord, that we know
[54:38] that you're here. Thank you for each and
[54:40] every life represented here, Lord Jesus.
[54:43] All of us desire more of you. And
[54:45] Father, we know that you said through
[54:47] your prophet to this bride in this age,
[54:50] if there is a desire for more, then that
[54:52] means there has to be more to be had.
[54:55] So, Father, let us drink from that
[54:56] fountain one more time today. Lord, if
[54:59] there's any needs in our midst today,
[55:01] Father, help us to not be bashful, but
[55:03] Lord, help us to come boldly according
[55:06] to your word to your throne of mercy and
[55:08] grace in our time of need. Father, we
[55:10] pray that you would sovereignly meet the
[55:12] needs in your hearts of your children.
[55:14] Be with those who are traveling, Lord.
[55:16] Bless the newlyweds, Lord. Father, we
[55:18] pray that you would just go with us now.
[55:21] Take us by the hand, Lord Jesus, and
[55:23] lead us where you will through your word
[55:26] today. Father, we just ask that you
[55:28] would be glorified in all that's said
[55:30] and done in our service now. In Jesus
[55:33] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's just
[55:36] sing that chorus one more time. Lord,
[55:39] feed your children as we invite brother
[55:41] Mano to come. Oh Lord, feed your
[55:46] children.
[55:47] [Music]
[55:58] of life.
[56:01] Oh, let me drink from
[56:05] the fountain
[56:08] that flows from the mountain.
[56:12] Let me feast from
[56:15] the table
[56:18] of life.
[56:22] Amen. Let's just pray one more time.
[56:25] Lord has already has been prayed and
[56:27] sung.
[56:29] The specials are sung and the offerings
[56:32] been taken. The time's come to where we
[56:36] like change the drama now to to speak
[56:39] from your word something that would be
[56:42] eternal. Maybe further fortify the faith
[56:46] that we now have. Lift us a little
[56:49] higher.
[56:50] bring us to a place to where our choices
[56:53] would be clear.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something that's troubling
[56:57] us along the way. Oh, there is an
[57:00] answer, but we have not found the answer
[57:03] yet. So, we ask Lord that you would do
[57:06] that for you are the great I am.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Said, I'm never going to leave you. I'll
[57:12] be with you even in you to the
[57:14] consummation of time.
[57:16] And if we ever knew, Lord, we are looked
[57:18] through all of history of the Bible
[57:21] and the vindicated word of this age
[57:25] confirms that the gentile dispensation
[57:28] has run out. The world's the book of
[57:30] redemption is about to be closed.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And there's be a rapture, a physical
[57:35] change of mortal bodies to immortality.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; We we revel in the glory of the changes
[57:42] that's going about now.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. as we labor daily laying in
[57:47] the presence of the som
[57:50] &gt;&gt; letting it bake out all the greenness
[57:52] and the imperfections
[57:55] &gt;&gt; for it isn't the mistake Lord it's like
[57:58] the our brother was singing we felt like
[58:01] we were so helpless
[58:03] &gt;&gt; but we realize now
[58:05] &gt;&gt; if we are a seed of God today we always
[58:08] have been a seed of you
[58:09] &gt;&gt; waiting to be quickened
[58:11] &gt;&gt; waiting to be made alive
[58:13] &gt;&gt; when the true word struck our soul,
[58:16] something sprung up and said, "That's
[58:19] nothing but the truth, Lord."
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And that is our testimony again today.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; It's nothing but the truth.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; but your word will never pass away.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; It's passing from glory to glory now
[58:36] &gt;&gt; into a greater glory till finally it'll
[58:38] end up into immortality.
[58:40] So, as we spend some time around your
[58:43] word, Lord, I pray that you'll enlighten
[58:45] us and strengthen us and encourage us
[58:47] and guide my mouth, Lord. And when I've
[58:49] said enough, nudge me that I've would
[58:51] understand
[58:53] to everything. There's a time and a
[58:55] season
[58:56] &gt;&gt; and a purpose.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; This has been a good season at the
[58:59] wedding here.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; We love to see a young couple start in
[59:03] Christ
[59:05] &gt;&gt; where they can labor together to build a
[59:07] home.
[59:08] for that we thank you and we ask your
[59:10] blessing on them again one more time and
[59:14] of course we'll pray for them daily Lord
[59:16] we pray for every family here that's
[59:18] raising children and and the children
[59:20] and the the old and the young Lord
[59:23] there's no age in Christ
[59:25] &gt;&gt; yes thank you
[59:26] &gt;&gt; but here we have different areas some
[59:29] are just being born others are old as
[59:33] far as the the body is concerned but our
[59:36] soul is immortal Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you now for your grace. Bless us
[59:39] around your word. We thank you for this
[59:42] music and the songs we ask in Jesus
[59:44] Christ's name.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You could be seated.
[59:50] Thank you. I'd like to just sing one
[59:52] course and then step down, but I better
[59:54] not.
[59:57] I lit the sister giving the testimony.
[59:59] You know, I thinking uh when I heard
[1:00:02] that I think how many times have I been
[1:00:05] there? I remember in the early years by
[1:00:06] I thought I would I be able to pay the
[1:00:09] next bill.
[1:00:11] Little is much when God's in it.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Labor not for wealth or fame.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; There's a crown and you can win it
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; if you go in Jesus name.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And it takes sometimes it takes all
[1:00:23] those things. We don't really like to
[1:00:25] talk about the things along our own
[1:00:27] life. Sometimes we don't like to talk
[1:00:28] about our own weaknesses and our
[1:00:30] shortcomings and our failures. But I was
[1:00:33] always so blessed in my life since I've
[1:00:37] heard brother Brandham speak. Uh you
[1:00:39] know the first time I heard him speak I
[1:00:41] was just a boy. But then when I heard
[1:00:42] him the next time I was 22 years old and
[1:00:45] the one thing I always noticed that he
[1:00:47] was not afraid or ashamed to say I was
[1:00:50] wrong.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; I thought he meant this. Then he
[1:00:55] revealed it. Now I know
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; that changed my mind. Which one of us
[1:01:00] would say here today, you haven't been
[1:01:01] hadn't had a mind change?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; I've had it
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; and we'll continue to have it as long as
[1:01:06] the Lord is leading and guiding us.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think if you if you know
[1:01:10] you're standing on the word of God, then
[1:01:12] just stay there. And if he leads a
[1:01:14] little higher, walk with that.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Good to see all of you. And of course,
[1:01:19] family. This morning, I'm preaching to
[1:01:21] family. My own children are here. And
[1:01:23] brother Mitch, Sister Vicki, it's good
[1:01:24] to see you. uh you know you you've been
[1:01:27] a good part of our friendship life and
[1:01:30] Saskatchewan all of them from
[1:01:31] Saskatchewan uh here Dwayne Connie and
[1:01:35] and uh Dave and Leanne Darren Denise
[1:01:39] will all of you um let me see of course
[1:01:41] you know you're here because of Shelly
[1:01:43] and the family and the Boyers they've uh
[1:01:45] they have been a great part of our life
[1:01:47] I I I grown every once in a while um
[1:01:52] this might sound a little bit odd that
[1:01:55] uh that Ken's been gone. How many years
[1:01:57] has Ken been gone?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Six.
[1:02:02] Still have a picture on the fridge of
[1:02:03] him.
[1:02:06] It's it's something that never will
[1:02:07] leave you. you know, he was my oh, maybe
[1:02:10] my first convert in the he was my
[1:02:13] convert in the Lord and then later on
[1:02:15] into the ministry and and uh and uh you
[1:02:18] know how later on uh Dwayne got married
[1:02:21] and they both became ministers and and
[1:02:24] uh Ken moving over here, but it always a
[1:02:27] secret prayer, you know, that uh Calgary
[1:02:31] didn't seem to have a fellowship. There
[1:02:33] was brothers around here. I'm not
[1:02:35] criticizing that at all, but there
[1:02:37] wasn't a real body here of believers.
[1:02:39] And today, I thank the Lord. You know,
[1:02:42] it took it takes time. It takes seasons.
[1:02:46] But in all things, uh God be glorified.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm glad to be here today. I know
[1:02:52] I'm an old man. I don't even like to
[1:02:54] talk about how old I am about how many
[1:02:56] years I've been here. But uh my Irene
[1:02:59] and I will be celebrating our 63rd year
[1:03:02] of being married.
[1:03:05] in November the 1st.
[1:03:11] And I want to say this humbly and and to
[1:03:14] the glory of God. I was just telling
[1:03:17] brother Barry, you know, it was in our
[1:03:20] life uh when I believe every person
[1:03:24] needs to find their place in the kingdom
[1:03:27] of God
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; in a home, husband, wives, children. You
[1:03:33] know, God has an order that he goes down
[1:03:35] and pushes us places us in the family.
[1:03:38] But with that order comes a
[1:03:40] responsibility.
[1:03:42] With that order comes an action. We know
[1:03:44] that when we're called to something,
[1:03:47] we're called to action. Not just to hear
[1:03:49] the word, but to be doers of the word.
[1:03:51] And there's where our problem starts
[1:03:53] coming in.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Then when we begin to do those things,
[1:03:56] then we learn along the way how to
[1:03:58] handle them. And I I uh I thank the Lord
[1:04:01] that that in the 63
[1:04:04] years that the Lord has always been the
[1:04:06] head of our home.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I believe he's been my head.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; The reason I cut my hair is because he's
[1:04:13] my head.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; The reason my wife doesn't cut her hair
[1:04:16] because I am her head. That's
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And the children are under the headship
[1:04:22] of Christ the word.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. For even as Christ and God is the
[1:04:26] head of Christ, so is Christ the head of
[1:04:29] the husband and the husband the head of
[1:04:31] the wife. And together
[1:04:34] that union makes a family.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And I I think so many times and I'm
[1:04:40] I'll probably just speak and uh see
[1:04:43] where where I enter in. But
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And and I told brother Barry, if I if I
[1:04:49] uh speak too short, then you take over.
[1:04:51] Finish it. If I speak too long, it go
[1:04:53] like this.
[1:04:56] But I don't think I will. I just uh I I
[1:04:58] just want to say that I thank the Lord
[1:05:00] for the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; And if you're standing in a place where
[1:05:05] you don't feel like you have the full
[1:05:06] understanding, just wait on the Lord
[1:05:09] because he is a giver
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; of life.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; No man can understand God
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:18] himself.
[1:05:19] No man knows the order of God,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; but by the divine revelation
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; of the son of man, the son of God, the
[1:05:28] son of David, which is Jesus Christ, the
[1:05:30] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we pray daily. Brother Aram
[1:05:34] said, "Whatever you do, whatever you do,
[1:05:36] pray daily for divine revelation."
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; For we cannot give revelation,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; we can preach it. Right.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The angel through the age taught us how
[1:05:48] to conduct oursel in the midst of the
[1:05:50] most perverse nation and world that'll
[1:05:53] ever be.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; In one sense, it's the worst condition
[1:05:56] that we've ever had it. In the other
[1:05:58] sense, it's the most glorious age we've
[1:06:00] ever lived in.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a paradox.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And it's not easy to take. it it's hard
[1:06:08] to know the vastness the difference
[1:06:10] between the two because Matthew 24 tells
[1:06:15] us that that when uh they were talking
[1:06:18] about the Jesus was speaking about the
[1:06:20] coming and so on and when shall you be
[1:06:22] and when shall be the sign of your
[1:06:23] coming and so on and Jesus stopped and
[1:06:25] the first thing he said take heed that
[1:06:27] no man deceive you.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] So while this is the two banks of of the
[1:06:34] most glorious age, the revelation of the
[1:06:37] very vindicated Christ who had his
[1:06:39] picture taken
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; in the return of the pillar of fire back
[1:06:44] into the church again.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; To bring in the headship of the word
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; to bring a people in line with the word
[1:06:51] for the body change.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; That's what it why we're here.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's why we still wrestle and every
[1:06:57] church has it. Don't think it's strange
[1:07:00] when there's differences in the body of
[1:07:01] church.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Because it's like a home. Uh could I say
[1:07:05] that we've lived 63 years and we've
[1:07:07] never had a single fuss about anything.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's been a glorious road. She's
[1:07:13] done everything I wanted her to do.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And then I woke up
[1:07:22] and found out Yes, she did.
[1:07:27] I'm not afraid to say this that if you
[1:07:29] husbands are all as happy with your wife
[1:07:31] as I am with mine, you're a blessed
[1:07:34] person.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:07:38] because of the revelation of Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ to her personally, which I
[1:07:42] believe every wife has to have the same
[1:07:44] revelation that every husband has to
[1:07:46] have. And if you're going to have a home
[1:07:49] where Christ is the center of it, it
[1:07:52] starts at the headship because it when
[1:07:54] God if God's going to ask something of
[1:07:55] me or of our home, he's not going to go
[1:07:57] to Irene.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; He's going to come to me.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; What have you done with the word that I
[1:08:03] gave you?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; For we are on earth.
[1:08:10] God is male.
[1:08:12] He's not female. But in him was the
[1:08:16] female attribute which we know in Adam
[1:08:19] and Eve the story. And I'm not going to
[1:08:20] go there but just to reckon ourselves
[1:08:23] today
[1:08:25] that in this age that we're living in
[1:08:27] now these two spirits are so strong.
[1:08:32] The rapture message is so real and so
[1:08:35] glorious to a people on earth right now
[1:08:37] around the world. There's people that's
[1:08:39] laying in the presence of this message
[1:08:40] worth all they've got. Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; They've given everything to it. They
[1:08:44] know that the angel God vindicated the
[1:08:47] pillar of fire returning and vindicating
[1:08:49] even to where the seven angels appeared
[1:08:51] and made up the headship. Did you ever
[1:08:53] notice how uh somebody took that and the
[1:08:55] seven angels and put the head of Hoffman
[1:08:57] head in there and then he took and and
[1:09:00] uh printed it the biatitudes and printed
[1:09:02] the biatitudes in there and then
[1:09:04] wherever it was dark where the face was
[1:09:05] to come out he put it darker and then
[1:09:06] lighter and brother and somebody gave
[1:09:08] that to brother Brandham and gave him
[1:09:09] the the picture and uh and brother Bram
[1:09:12] looks at it and said oh what a
[1:09:14] revelation that is
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; there he is Christ
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; the word looking right out of the word.
[1:09:21] Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And there is the face of almighty God
[1:09:25] veiled.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yet revealed
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; coming right out of the word.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And the very things even brother Bram
[1:09:34] said many times in his in his ministry,
[1:09:36] he said now when he talked about the
[1:09:38] seven seals and so on. Oh, how how
[1:09:39] adamant he was. He said, "We're waiting
[1:09:41] for that time, that third pole, when
[1:09:42] that comes. You just wait. It's not even
[1:09:44] written in the book.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; It's not even written the B in the
[1:09:46] Bible." He said,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; "Yeah,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; he kept on saying that."
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And even when the first seal came and
[1:09:53] the second seal came, you you that are
[1:09:54] familiar with the message and not going
[1:09:56] to go and explain everything because you
[1:09:58] know how it is. We throw a pitch and
[1:09:59] say, "Oh, I know what that one's that
[1:10:01] was a curveball." Yeah. This Oh, that's
[1:10:03] a fast ball. I don't even play ball. So,
[1:10:05] why am I talking about that?
[1:10:08] Well, it did a little bit, but very
[1:10:09] little. But what I'm saying, when God
[1:10:12] throws something, you know, you you've
[1:10:14] read the message.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; You're not ignorant anymore. you you
[1:10:18] people are you're you're gathered maybe
[1:10:20] there's a few some here that's just
[1:10:21] starting but I tell you what you mean
[1:10:23] sure real quickly when you start when
[1:10:25] you get into the word of God
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; he knows how to quicken it
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; but but the word of God is sharp and in
[1:10:32] in this putting it together he knows
[1:10:35] just how to feed his sheep
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm grateful today and I I want
[1:10:39] to I want to say this um I I look down
[1:10:42] here I I had one little thing I wanted
[1:10:44] to recognize
[1:10:45] and I I'm
[1:10:47] I'm very happy also in the thought
[1:10:49] before I turn to the scripture uh just
[1:10:51] to be here and to be a part of this
[1:10:53] wedding. Uh it meant a lot to me too to
[1:10:55] see Logan who we have so prayed for and
[1:10:58] and uh you know
[1:11:01] see Lucas Kristen here today. Is anybody
[1:11:04] good to see you and all the family you
[1:11:06] know that they they uh they mean a lot
[1:11:08] to me because I I realize
[1:11:12] uh I want to actually spend eternity
[1:11:14] with them.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And I I know I've always, this is a
[1:11:19] little bit personal, but
[1:11:21] when we travel, I love to travel. One of
[1:11:24] the reasons is because somebody said,
[1:11:26] "Why don't you fly more?" And said,
[1:11:27] "Well, personally
[1:11:29] uh I'm not ready to fly yet.
[1:11:32] I I'm still earthly." And uh so when I
[1:11:35] drive and I see uh all of a sudden I I
[1:11:37] get around this Calgary area and years
[1:11:39] ago, I I parked in top. I looked I
[1:11:41] looked at that cowboy. Where's that that
[1:11:43] place there? I won't even know the
[1:11:44] place, but it's somewhere here, west of
[1:11:46] here. And they they said the cowboy rode
[1:11:48] in one day and he looked at that that
[1:11:50] country, beautiful rolling hills. He
[1:11:53] said, "Here's where I want to settle."
[1:11:58] And you ever get that feeling where you
[1:11:59] say, "Oh, I would just love to live here
[1:12:01] to have my family all around me and all
[1:12:03] of them with one accord, one oh, just a
[1:12:06] be." See, when you get married, you get
[1:12:07] a family then.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's be good to be a husband, wife,
[1:12:11] but then the family comes. Now you
[1:12:13] become a unit.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Now you want to do things and then you
[1:12:17] think, "Oh, wouldn't that be glorious
[1:12:19] just to see there goes my son over
[1:12:20] there, there goes my daughter there and
[1:12:22] there goes this one. Oh, and the cattle
[1:12:23] everywhere and oh, oh, this is this is
[1:12:25] it."
[1:12:27] And then I remember, hey, I'm 83 years
[1:12:29] old.
[1:12:31] And now if I was still on the ranch, I'd
[1:12:33] say, "Yeah, it looks good from here.
[1:12:36] Yeah, it looks good from here. I don't
[1:12:38] have the zeal anymore.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; It's dying.
[1:12:43] But do you know that the earth is
[1:12:44] actually made for man?
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; We're actually made to live here.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when we get into that
[1:12:51] eternal body? Brother says when you find
[1:12:53] a spot there, you'll you you say, "I
[1:12:56] wonder if Brother Brown made it."
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; I was saying, "Amazing
[1:13:00] grace, how sweet the sound." Say, "Oh,
[1:13:03] he made it. It's down there." And you
[1:13:05] know, he gives different illustrations
[1:13:06] about where he's at. Down there by the
[1:13:09] little cabin. And besides what is a
[1:13:12] home?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I've seen things that looks like a
[1:13:16] beautiful home,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; but it's basically just a house.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; You can have 50 rooms in there,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; but it's just a house,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Unless love dwells there.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; It's just mortar, buildings, and brick.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And take a little cabin. It might look
[1:13:33] broke down, be nothing, but have love
[1:13:35] there. And it's a home sweet home.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And the buffalo don't roam there.
[1:13:40] Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; It is home sweet home.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe about this gospel.
[1:13:45] To me, when I heard the angel speak to
[1:13:48] this age, it became home.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; The deep calling to the deep. I be
[1:13:52] something begin to settle in my heart. I
[1:13:55] knew not then, but later on I found out
[1:13:57] that I'd always been a part of God.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why I could
[1:14:01] respond
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; to the voice of the age.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read a scripture before I
[1:14:08] close.
[1:14:10] and 1 Corinthians 1. And uh if you just
[1:14:15] bear with me a little bit, I this is
[1:14:17] maybe quite a bit of longer service than
[1:14:18] I than I've got more notes here than
[1:14:20] I'll use today, but I want to just bring
[1:14:23] a little something that was dear to me.
[1:14:25] You know, after 60 years or 50 years, 52
[1:14:28] years of preaching, I' I've thrown away
[1:14:31] stacks of notes, you know, over the
[1:14:32] years. Now everything's on computer, but
[1:14:35] I'm just a little bit behind. Uh, I
[1:14:38] still uh I still like to write it down.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Uh, because usually the battery dies
[1:14:44] when I'm up here or I didn't charge it
[1:14:47] right or and that makes me more nervous
[1:14:49] than if I write it down. But first
[1:14:51] Corinthians, why don't you stand just a
[1:14:53] little change and uh I'm
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; 1 and 18 if you drop in there or let's
[1:14:59] start with the 17th verse. For Christ
[1:15:01] sent me not to baptize, Paul's speaking
[1:15:04] here, but to preach the gospel, not with
[1:15:06] wisdom of words, lest the cross of
[1:15:09] Christ should be made of none effect.
[1:15:13] For the preaching of the cross is to
[1:15:16] them that perish foolishness, but to
[1:15:19] unto us which are are saved, it is the
[1:15:22] power of God. Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; For it is written, I will destroy the
[1:15:26] wisdom of the wise and will bring to
[1:15:30] nothing the understanding of the
[1:15:32] prudent.
[1:15:34] Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
[1:15:36] Where is the disputer of the world? Hath
[1:15:39] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[1:15:43] world?
[1:15:44] For after that the wisdom
[1:15:47] of God
[1:15:49] of the world, pardon me. For after that
[1:15:52] in the wisdom of God, the world by the
[1:15:54] wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by
[1:15:57] the foolishness of preaching to save
[1:16:00] them that believe.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; For the Jews required a sign, and the
[1:16:06] Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach
[1:16:08] Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
[1:16:11] stumbling block, unto the Greeks
[1:16:12] foolishness. But unto them which are
[1:16:16] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
[1:16:20] power of God, and the wisdom of God,
[1:16:22] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[1:16:26] than men, and the weakness of God is
[1:16:29] greater than men.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Father,
[1:16:34] we could continue to read, but drawing
[1:16:37] from there just a thought that I pray
[1:16:39] that will help us, strengthen us, and
[1:16:42] encourage us. Ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:16:45] name. Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; You can be seated if you would.
[1:16:50] I like St. John 5:24.
[1:16:52] I always like to quote it, but it's
[1:16:55] good. He, not they, not them, but he.
[1:17:00] It's a personal relationship.
[1:17:03] He that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:17:07] him that sent me hath everlasting or
[1:17:10] eternal life, Zoe, and shall not come
[1:17:12] into condemnation or judgment, but is
[1:17:15] passed from death into life.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; There's another quote, Brother Bram, uh
[1:17:20] that I would like to read, discerning
[1:17:22] the body. And uh you've read it many
[1:17:25] times. I'm sure you have. But our
[1:17:28] eternal destination
[1:17:30] is not altogether determined by what we
[1:17:32] see or what we hear.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in. Our eternal. Every one
[1:17:42] of us sitting here today realizes you're
[1:17:44] heading somewhere.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; You can't stay here. There's a little
[1:17:48] song said, "You don't have to go to
[1:17:49] heaven and you don't have to go to hell,
[1:17:52] but you can't stay here." Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; It's uh supposed to be a gospel song,
[1:17:58] but it okay. It is. But I see u we we
[1:18:03] can't stay here.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; There's not a morning that I don't get
[1:18:06] up here that it doesn't tell me. You
[1:18:08] remember? You know why?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz the the bones they begin to
[1:18:15] So that wasn't that way at one time.
[1:18:18] But you can't stay here. Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I'd like to stay here and see all of my
[1:18:22] great grandchildren grow up and go to
[1:18:24] the get married. And I'm glad to see
[1:18:26] some of the grandchildren,
[1:18:28] but great grandchildren. We loads of
[1:18:30] them now.
[1:18:32] Like to see every one of them. Those
[1:18:33] little ones. Yeah. But I probably won't
[1:18:35] see them if life continues.
[1:18:40] But we're all determined. We all have to
[1:18:42] go. We have to make that choice. No
[1:18:45] one's going to force you into it.
[1:18:48] No one's going to talk you into it.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; But the revel faith comes by hearing the
[1:18:53] word.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; If you hear it and are obedient, you
[1:18:57] shall live. You hear it and don't obey
[1:18:59] it, then it becomes judgment and
[1:19:01] condemnation to you.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; No man can quench the the grace of God
[1:19:08] when he pours it out. And I like the
[1:19:10] song, Brother Justin,
[1:19:13] that you hear Brother Bram talk about.
[1:19:15] I'd like to talk about misgrace.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; There's something most precious. We're
[1:19:20] saved by grace.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And we're kept by the mercy of God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "You're not even
[1:19:27] saved by the blood.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace." And the blood is
[1:19:30] what keeps you.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Keeps washing by the washing of the
[1:19:34] water by the word because it's the
[1:19:36] bleeding word that we're feeding on
[1:19:38] daily. It's the lifegiving word.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; This is not religion. This is not cre.
[1:19:43] We all had religion. I had menite
[1:19:45] religion. I don't know what you had, but
[1:19:48] I had menite religion. Some very good
[1:19:50] thoughts. Women didn't cut their hair.
[1:19:52] They didn't wear pants. They were
[1:19:53] obedient to their husband. They had
[1:19:56] home. They stayed home. They worked out
[1:19:58] of the home. Whether they had much or
[1:20:01] little,
[1:20:03] that was the Menite way. You still see
[1:20:05] it. Now, there's a blessing in that.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. when I see today women living
[1:20:10] every kind of a life and women getting
[1:20:12] out there with the men into the world of
[1:20:14] the of men and so look at the perversion
[1:20:16] of the world today which that that's not
[1:20:17] my my message today but but I don't even
[1:20:19] want to spend time on that because
[1:20:22] that's got its own judgment
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; y
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; and it's going so fastly to that place
[1:20:28] to where that stream you can't slow it
[1:20:31] down
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; like a snowball you an avalanche you
[1:20:35] can't just hold your hand and hit back
[1:20:38] They keep back an avalanche. It It'll
[1:20:39] take its course.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But our eternal destination is not
[1:20:44] altogether determined by what we see or
[1:20:47] what we hear, but it's determined
[1:20:50] on what discernment
[1:20:53] we have of what we see and what we hear.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Pastors can't give discernment.
[1:21:02] Ministers can't give that. When Jesus
[1:21:05] was on earth and his prophets were here,
[1:21:07] they spoke the word. And if the seed
[1:21:10] laid in there, it quickened.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Just like the Lord in the beginning when
[1:21:15] he saw it was void and and uh dark.
[1:21:20] But one day he looked down and he spoke
[1:21:22] the word and the sun be to shine
[1:21:26] giving life to every seed that already
[1:21:30] laid there by predestination on this
[1:21:32] earth. Do you know before light came
[1:21:34] every seed was already planted here
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; waiting for the su n
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; and so is the predestinated will of God
[1:21:41] waiting for the s o end to shine in your
[1:21:44] heart and when the seventh angel now
[1:21:46] remember when the church ages changed
[1:21:47] and uh the last one was Pentecostal the
[1:21:49] pouring out of the spirit of God upon
[1:21:51] all flesh but out of that come a message
[1:21:55] that would turn the hearts of the
[1:21:56] children back to the original faith
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; and every predestinated bride seed would
[1:22:01] be quickened by that and come out of
[1:22:03] denomination, come out from among them.
[1:22:05] Be your shepherd, sayith the Lord, into
[1:22:07] the word fellowship.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why every time we hear
[1:22:10] something or see something, we we go
[1:22:12] back to the word. Go back to the
[1:22:14] message.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Barry and I were just
[1:22:16] talking a little bit. I appreciate that.
[1:22:17] I'm a little older than he, but uh but
[1:22:19] he's probably got more wisdom than I
[1:22:20] have already. But but to go and and to
[1:22:23] to take it to the word of God when you
[1:22:25] hear something say, "Wait a minute, that
[1:22:27] sounds a little strange."
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Well, we have a urine
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; thumb. Yes,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; we have a year thumb. This Bible, not
[1:22:35] the scripture, not the writing of it,
[1:22:37] the revelation by the seventh angel upon
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; this age.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; For there is a portion of this word
[1:22:44] that's being fulfilled now. Most of it,
[1:22:46] did you ever go over there in Romans
[1:22:48] where Paul talks about how the Old
[1:22:50] Testament could not do away with with
[1:22:53] sin?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; It could just cover it,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; right? But Jesus Christ so he knowled
[1:22:59] all of that those all of that old
[1:23:01] testament they never did come to the
[1:23:02] place to where it took away the desire
[1:23:04] of sin or unbelief.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came he not only set a
[1:23:09] person free but he took the desire of
[1:23:11] sin out.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad today that when I hey
[1:23:15] there's all kinds of things that flash
[1:23:17] in front of you and immorality and all
[1:23:18] kind but oh sometimes I just walk around
[1:23:20] and say Lord God it's so good to have
[1:23:22] blinders on you know.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. just keep on walking. What's that
[1:23:26] to thee? Follow thou me?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we ask, "What if this happens?
[1:23:30] What if that happens?" Jesus said,
[1:23:32] "Never mind that."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Right.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; What's that to thee?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Well, if one lives longer than the other
[1:23:38] and said, "Well, no. What's that to
[1:23:39] thee? Follow thou me."
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. Stay with the
[1:23:43] message. And if I've got one advice for
[1:23:45] you, this place here of of discernment
[1:23:48] comes by one way. Lord,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; feed me.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Open my understanding to the word. Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Now, usually in life, we find that it's
[1:23:57] easy to correct
[1:24:01] with the beam in our eye.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Did you ever notice how Jesus doesn't
[1:24:05] say when he talked about that, he said,
[1:24:06] uh, when thou
[1:24:09] correct thy brother,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Remove the beam of thine own eye first,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and then you shall help the moat of your
[1:24:18] brother. That's just that's usually we
[1:24:20] don't like to I I Lord remove this
[1:24:22] molten from my eye so I can take the
[1:24:23] beam out of my brother.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's not what he said.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; He actually said remove the beam out of
[1:24:30] your own eye first.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Let your spirit be right first
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; before you go to correcting
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; your brother, your sister.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Let your spirit be right before the Lord
[1:24:41] so that when you're being judged by the
[1:24:43] word, you say, "Lord, I did that at your
[1:24:46] will and for your purpose. I have no
[1:24:49] other purpose to help my brother, my
[1:24:51] sister, or whoever it might be. It might
[1:24:53] be a sinner. It might be so like even in
[1:24:55] the scripture, you'll find out there
[1:24:56] were some strong things. I think that
[1:24:58] time when when uh Paul had to rebuke
[1:25:01] Peter
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; about circumcision, you know how we
[1:25:05] sometimes get a little partial and a
[1:25:07] little bit, well, I that brother
[1:25:08] believes the doctrine different. I I
[1:25:10] sure hope nobody saw that I was standing
[1:25:11] with him.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe he'll think I'm like him.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Right? So when the circumcision people
[1:25:16] walked in, Peter was sitting with the
[1:25:19] uncircumcised Gentiles
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; and they looked around and they kind of
[1:25:22] looked at him and said,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; you know, walked by and sat down
[1:25:26] together.
[1:25:28] So Peter said, "Excuse me." Um, and he
[1:25:31] walked away and sat with them.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And Paul saw it one day,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; said, "Are you that carnal?"
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Having started in grace and now go back
[1:25:41] to works again.
[1:25:43] Let me say this church.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Are we that carnal that we started in
[1:25:47] the grace of God, in the joy of God? Now
[1:25:49] go back to works again. God forbid.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Give grace to someone else.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to myself. That's always
[1:25:56] there.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And but you but let's just move on a
[1:26:00] little bit. I want to just spend a
[1:26:01] little time on this. Look at the
[1:26:04] we talked about the marriage yesterday
[1:26:06] and uh the two shall become one.
[1:26:12] I show a great mystery. He said, Paul
[1:26:14] said, I I love that Ephesians part and
[1:26:16] he sets it in order so that you needn't
[1:26:18] even question about it. But he sets it
[1:26:20] in order. And and the two shall become
[1:26:24] one. Yet really what we realize a union
[1:26:26] of husband wife is a great thing. But
[1:26:29] what really is the glory of the husband
[1:26:31] wife is the family that comes into it.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; They begin to glorify
[1:26:37] or bring shame or disgrace. Many times
[1:26:40] that happens as well. And uh yet the
[1:26:43] children is what binds a family
[1:26:45] together. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I'd imagine there's many of people maybe
[1:26:48] that would get to that place and being
[1:26:50] that we're in the age now uh we we've
[1:26:53] gone I would say this respectfully and
[1:26:56] and been around long enough that I know
[1:26:59] that after the message to the age
[1:27:04] after the messenger's gone little by
[1:27:07] little little things begin to seep in
[1:27:09] among what we call message believers
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and all of them are there to dilute
[1:27:16] the sincerity
[1:27:18] and the reality Satan has but one motive
[1:27:22] just to dilute it a little bit because
[1:27:24] to move one part of the word that's all
[1:27:27] it takes then the next thing do you know
[1:27:29] what the first lie you ever told was
[1:27:32] hard
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; but the second one came easier
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; the third one came so and you got
[1:27:37] there's people that actually tell lies
[1:27:39] actually believing their own lie
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; they're convinced the truth just tell it
[1:27:44] often enough.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Do you ever tell a story about how big
[1:27:49] the fish was you caught?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Like some of my good brothers that said,
[1:27:55] "Don't let truth stand on the way of a
[1:27:56] good fish story."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; But you know what? They grow every time.
[1:28:03] Ah, you know what? You wouldn't believe
[1:28:06] it. What? Well, you you should have seen
[1:28:09] what we caught. It was probably like
[1:28:11] that.
[1:28:12] But it's something about nature.
[1:28:16] Brother Bram tells himself on himself.
[1:28:19] He said, you know, uh I I exaggerate.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; It it's true. Some people extremely
[1:28:27] exaggerate. Some have a little bit more
[1:28:29] modified way of doing things. But but
[1:28:30] but there is something about
[1:28:32] exaggeration that that now if you're
[1:28:34] going to exaggerate and if we get let's
[1:28:36] talk about the Lord, how great he is.
[1:28:40] how how he's going how he's he's watched
[1:28:43] over me. He oh man down there in the
[1:28:45] pit,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; but he never left me.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And I and and uh I don't know what it
[1:28:50] was. This was this morning I was
[1:28:52] dreaming about Daniel being in the lions
[1:28:53] that I don't even know why. I don't know
[1:28:55] what what I was thinking about. It was
[1:28:56] very short, but all I remember him being
[1:28:58] in the hole and then afterward uh you
[1:29:00] know the king looking in there and uh
[1:29:04] and I I wonder how did they get Daniel
[1:29:06] out of there in the dream? How did they
[1:29:09] get out of them? How do they Well, there
[1:29:10] must have been a way underneath there
[1:29:11] where they got in there to the to let
[1:29:12] the lions out. Then I woke up. So, I
[1:29:16] don't know what that means. But the
[1:29:17] thing is, how do you get sometimes into
[1:29:20] a situation
[1:29:22] where you say, "How do I get out of
[1:29:24] this?"
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; The same way you got in,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; make it right. Turn around.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Sell all you have. If if if it gets in
[1:29:32] the way like like brother brother Paul
[1:29:34] you're talking sometimes it takes
[1:29:36] bankruptcy
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; to make you appreciate
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; oh yeah I've been when I first started
[1:29:44] ministering and let me put it this now
[1:29:46] I'm going talk about myself but let me
[1:29:48] talk about the grace of God
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; that called me
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; listen when God called me to preach it
[1:29:55] was by dreams and by understanding and
[1:29:58] by revelation there was no church
[1:30:00] supporting me. There's no financial
[1:30:03] backing.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; I sold what I had and I had a wife and
[1:30:07] two children. Or did I have three? Oh,
[1:30:10] yes, she came up three. Yeah.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Good time. Thanks, honey.
[1:30:14] David was born then already. You were.
[1:30:18] I had nothing.
[1:30:21] But in the in the vision, and I say this
[1:30:24] uh all my life, I've been a dreamer. But
[1:30:26] you know what? Dreams are awfully
[1:30:27] dangerous,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; right? until I heard what Brother Bam
[1:30:30] said, how to handle them.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; If they're scriptural, watch it.
[1:30:37] If you don't understand them, leave them
[1:30:39] alone.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; There's a I'm sure some of you would
[1:30:43] have hand said, "Do you dream a lot?"
[1:30:44] Hell, I do.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I dream a lot. Maybe it's because my
[1:30:49] mind is always busy. It is. It is one of
[1:30:52] those things. I I have the hardest time
[1:30:54] falling asleep. My mind's always going.
[1:30:56] I'm either preaching or I'm standing.
[1:30:58] Oh, I'd like to say it this way. Some of
[1:31:00] my best sermons I've ever preached is it
[1:31:01] while I'm going to bed.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, and it flows. And brain, you know
[1:31:06] what I'm talking about. Sometimes you
[1:31:07] get a you oh, you get like an anointing.
[1:31:10] Uh you sleep there and say, "Oh, if I
[1:31:12] could just bring this the way it's come
[1:31:14] to to the church this morning, there
[1:31:16] would be a revival."
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Then you get behind the pulpit and then
[1:31:20] it's uh oh yeah, this one has this
[1:31:22] spirit. That one has that spirit. This
[1:31:24] one has that spirit. This is that. And
[1:31:25] that's what it is. makes it a church, a
[1:31:28] body.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask us all to have the same
[1:31:30] problem,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But there's something though when you go
[1:31:33] through it. You talk about financial
[1:31:35] sometimes financial trouble can be big.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It can be real hard. And I remember when
[1:31:42] I sold all I had. I think I had maybe
[1:31:45] about $500 in my pocket after I I sold
[1:31:48] my truck and I knew I was on the way.
[1:31:50] What are you going to do? I'm going to
[1:31:51] tell how the fire got lit.
[1:31:54] I didn't have a deep message. I just
[1:31:56] wanted to go tell that God had sent a
[1:31:58] prophet
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and that I was a believer of this
[1:32:00] message and I just wanted to go tell.
[1:32:03] That's what I did. Made the rounds.
[1:32:06] Found little churches along the way. I
[1:32:08] knew that because they used to come to
[1:32:09] our camp and different little house
[1:32:10] meetings
[1:32:13] for years and years, 10 years as an
[1:32:16] evangelist.
[1:32:19] There's always more month than money.
[1:32:23] That's what it was.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; It talked to my wife said many times we
[1:32:27] had to scrape and get pennies just to
[1:32:28] get milk for the children.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; But I was never happier in my life
[1:32:32] because I knew I was in the will of God.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. As you get older and and things
[1:32:38] change. I thank him for that. But I
[1:32:40] never will forget
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; the making up of the trust of God. When
[1:32:45] you've done all to stand, then just
[1:32:48] stand there and wait. God's heard your
[1:32:50] prayer. If it's sincere and you're not
[1:32:52] got the right motive, you're not trying
[1:32:54] to get rich. I never thought of anything
[1:32:57] like that. Riches is not the purpose.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the richest people many
[1:33:03] times have hardly two nickels to run
[1:33:05] together. But if you're rich in Christ,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; if you're rich in Christ and your heart
[1:33:11] burns daily for the Lord and you know
[1:33:13] that you're walking in this light,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; but it's the discernment of it. What
[1:33:19] have you heard the prophet say? And what
[1:33:21] is your discernment of what he's been
[1:33:23] saying?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Where are we
[1:33:26] standing now? See, and in our homes,
[1:33:29] see, but sin has a separates us and and
[1:33:33] in the new birth and as I was I was
[1:33:35] thinking before, one day when this all
[1:33:38] is over now, the work on earth is done
[1:33:40] and our our and the rapture takes place,
[1:33:44] do you know he's going to renovate this
[1:33:45] earth and set it up so that we can come
[1:33:48] back and spend eternity here?
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You know, Hebrews says they're waiting
[1:33:52] on us,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. But they're waiting on us.
[1:33:55] Maybe you some of you want to be a
[1:33:57] farmer. You want to be this and said
[1:33:59] when we get wait till it's perfect again
[1:34:02] all the disasters there'll be no more
[1:34:04] hail and no more storms. There'll be no
[1:34:06] more tornadoes. There'll be no more
[1:34:07] mudslides and look at look at the world
[1:34:09] over right now. If you if you're if
[1:34:11] you're like me every once in a while I
[1:34:13] get on the YouTube and and uh by the way
[1:34:15] I I should say something about that too.
[1:34:17] But uh I'll be very careful.
[1:34:20] All of the devices all right but they
[1:34:23] have a limitation.
[1:34:24] Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with a new car,
[1:34:27] sister, new what do you get? There's
[1:34:29] nothing wrong with any new house.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the things, computer,
[1:34:34] internet. They're all inventions
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; from the tree of knowledge.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; But they are not eternal.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And they'll pass away with the using.
[1:34:44] And AI, what you think is so intelligent
[1:34:46] now, hasn't even got close to where what
[1:34:49] we see.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] Why? The the intelligence of a real true
[1:34:54] believer, the smallest young person here
[1:34:56] could literally set a a theologian
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; back on a seat.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; At one time, Brother Bam gets a little
[1:35:02] that little bit excited behind the and
[1:35:04] he's talking about said why I couldn't
[1:35:05] make their head spin.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Said just a minute. I I
[1:35:09] didn't mean to say it. Lord, forgive me.
[1:35:11] Said I couldn't make anybody's head
[1:35:12] spin, but he said the Lord could.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; He knew with the revelation that he had,
[1:35:20] he spoke lipto ear with God.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; God spoke lip to ear with his prophet
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and said, "Go tell the people what I
[1:35:28] think of them.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Go take this message to the world."
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Don't don't take money, women, or or or
[1:35:35] popularity. Watch those three. But they
[1:35:37] you need them.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Do you ever What good would it be if you
[1:35:41] had no if nobody had confidence in his
[1:35:42] ministry?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:45] But you know, there's some of us that
[1:35:46] would lay down our life for that word.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Because it's thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; It's not some just a little something
[1:35:54] that we made up or some good stories. No
[1:35:56] sir. It's thus sayith the Lord. See, and
[1:35:59] that's the that's where how we raise our
[1:36:01] family here. I want to just close with
[1:36:03] this.
[1:36:05] Discerning the Lord's body. And you
[1:36:08] know, and this is the age Matthew 24. I
[1:36:10] said about deception before, but did you
[1:36:13] ever see an age more perverted than this
[1:36:15] age?
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; I I we when we were kids,
[1:36:20] you didn't hear the names and the words
[1:36:22] they got today.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; There's a whole new volume of of words
[1:36:26] and interpretations and and uh uh some
[1:36:29] of the the latest things. Uh uh here the
[1:36:32] other day, somebody called me bro.
[1:36:35] Well, of course I'm looking around.
[1:36:40] All right. What's wrong with brother?
[1:36:43] Oh, but it's short. Yeah, I know we I
[1:36:45] know we spell BR O. I mean, that's fine.
[1:36:47] I just never heard it before. You Oh,
[1:36:49] bro. There's a few things I haven't
[1:36:51] heard yet.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm thinking, oh, okay.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; I wonder where that started from.
[1:37:03] Amen. Bro, hey,
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:09] something's a little bit wrong.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Where did it come from that I don't know
[1:37:15] what I am? Whether I'm a male or a
[1:37:17] female, I don't know what I am. Where do
[1:37:20] you think that came from?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Where do you think all the language
[1:37:23] changes of this age taking on a slang?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:29] There are things we use as slang and I
[1:37:30] hey and I I probably do it myself. Not
[1:37:33] willingly, but I'm I'm not trying to say
[1:37:35] they're wrong
[1:37:38] because in Christ we also recognize that
[1:37:41] we're neither male nor female.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Sisters, you got the same Holy Ghost
[1:37:46] that your husband has.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Same Holy Ghost.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Your ministry on earth is different
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; and your position on earth is different.
[1:37:54] but in Christ. And when we get over
[1:37:56] there, there'd be neither male nor
[1:37:58] female. Yet,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; in the souls as they came running, women
[1:38:01] and men, they were every bit women,
[1:38:03] every bit men,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; but the sex glands were gone.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And there was no more reproduction by
[1:38:10] the sex glands.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; It was spoken word children,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; what God intended to do in the
[1:38:15] beginning. But how could else could he
[1:38:16] have been a savior, a healer, a
[1:38:18] deliverer, a king, a shepherd, a judge?
[1:38:21] How could he be all these attributes
[1:38:23] delayed in him waiting there to be
[1:38:24] delivered and loosed? But now we see
[1:38:26] them.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Now we see them clearly. All of his
[1:38:29] attributes been expressed.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Turn to the very last one. Now
[1:38:34] you say, "What about who is he? What's
[1:38:36] he what's he uh to the people that don't
[1:38:38] accept him?" Well, he's their judge.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; He's their jury.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Just like he's our judge and our jury
[1:38:46] unto righteousness. So he's a judge and
[1:38:48] jury unto unrighteousness. He'd have one
[1:38:50] plea. He said, "Did you hear my word
[1:38:52] when I spoke it?"
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; "Well, I heard it, but I didn't listen."
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; There's your judgment then.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; No man will condemn you.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; No woman will condemn you.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But let me close with this thought here.
[1:39:07] But in all of this, you as parents, I'm
[1:39:10] thinking since we had the wedding, let
[1:39:11] me just close a little bit on closing
[1:39:13] that. parents,
[1:39:16] you've got a tremendous opportunity
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; to raise sons and daughters for God,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Teach them truth.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; No matter how it hurts,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; because truth is the only thing that
[1:39:29] will prevail. Not my word, but God's
[1:39:32] truth.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Tell them the truth in love. you you've
[1:39:36] got to raise the children
[1:39:38] uh in the midst of what we call all
[1:39:40] these perversions, wisdom, weakness,
[1:39:43] unbelief. It's all over. See, and and
[1:39:46] yet in all of that,
[1:39:49] think of this age of all of the all of
[1:39:51] the ages that God had taken a bride out
[1:39:53] of the most sinful,
[1:39:56] perverted,
[1:39:58] twisted minds.
[1:40:01] So that great theologians in the
[1:40:03] universities of the teaching class don't
[1:40:06] even know what they are anymore.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; And they're teaching children that they
[1:40:11] shouldn't know what they are.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Chaos.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Completely twisted so far. And they were
[1:40:18] once made in the image of God
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; and now twisted so by Satan's gradual
[1:40:25] deviation.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:40:29] I say this,
[1:40:32] a little clip came up on the YouTube and
[1:40:35] one of our prime ministers way back
[1:40:38] when I was a young man,
[1:40:42] they proudly declared him to be the one
[1:40:45] that declared the same-sex marriages and
[1:40:48] it became law in Canada
[1:40:51] as a hero.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; A hero of perversion.
[1:40:57] Any
[1:40:59] animal is smarter than that.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; All of God's creation is smarter than
[1:41:03] that. Only man who's made in the image
[1:41:05] of God has so been so deluded by wisdom,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; right? by technology,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; by twisting the truth, by operations of
[1:41:13] truth, by operations taking away, taking
[1:41:16] the power of God and twisting the minds
[1:41:17] of the people so much that today
[1:41:22] you hardly blame, and I'm going to say
[1:41:24] that, hear me right. You hardly blame
[1:41:26] men and women for not getting married
[1:41:28] anymore.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Because there's a divorce on the way.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. within five years if they don't
[1:41:34] agree on this and and there's and the
[1:41:36] responsibility it's so awful now that
[1:41:39] let's say 50% of of the people that get
[1:41:42] married now
[1:41:44] within five years are divorced
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; that's the ones that get married
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; but the ones that just live together
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; common law
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; and it's the easy way around it
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; yes it is
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; say well yeah all that twisted I don't
[1:41:59] know what religion to believe and so
[1:42:03] But God has a word.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He said marriage is honorable.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I said earlier, it's not an agreement.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a marriage license. It's a
[1:42:14] covenant.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Your marriage, my marriage to Jesus
[1:42:18] Christ is not just a document.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Or religion or had a title such
[1:42:23] Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecost. It
[1:42:25] doesn't have a title. It's born of the
[1:42:27] spirit.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; When they asked brother, said, "What
[1:42:29] church do you belong to?" You said none
[1:42:31] said then what what what where where you
[1:42:33] at? Said I was born into a kingdom.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And when we're born into a kingdom, we
[1:42:37] become part of that kingdom.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You are the kingdom then.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Jude, I think put it about the best. I
[1:42:47] won't read it, but you read it when you
[1:42:48] get home.
[1:42:50] He put it about how debauchery it would
[1:42:53] become at the end time. And if you know,
[1:42:56] it's a short little book before
[1:42:57] Revelations.
[1:42:59] read it and see how degrading it would
[1:43:02] become by the end till God finally said
[1:43:05] it's over.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know in 1964 when brother Brand
[1:43:10] was here?
[1:43:14] He said I used to call it the church. He
[1:43:17] said
[1:43:19] he said but I indict this generation for
[1:43:21] the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[1:43:24] the word.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. They could never kill him again as
[1:43:28] a person.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; he was once he was once here and I had a
[1:43:34] a real kind of a blessing something. You
[1:43:36] know you how it is when you listen to
[1:43:38] the tape sometimes you hear something
[1:43:39] special. I you hear it over and over
[1:43:41] again but I heard something the other
[1:43:42] day it was so beautiful in a little
[1:43:44] message called influence.
[1:43:47] Brother Abraham talks about Isaiah and
[1:43:49] you know the prophet and how he's
[1:43:50] influenced and but then he comes to the
[1:43:52] place he said you know do you know Jesus
[1:43:54] you know why God became flesh and blood
[1:43:58] so that he could fully understand
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; what sin was
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; he could fully understand what it means
[1:44:06] to be challenged by the temptation that
[1:44:09] becomes to a human being.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; But he stopped on one little spot that I
[1:44:13] really loved. He said, "You know what?
[1:44:16] when you're misunderstood in life.
[1:44:20] How many of you wives have ever been
[1:44:21] misunderstood by your husband? Don't
[1:44:23] even raise your hand
[1:44:26] or vice versa.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; How many times you've been misunderstood
[1:44:30] at work, at school, wherever you go, or
[1:44:34] you're just a religious threat. No. How
[1:44:36] many He said, "When you're
[1:44:38] misunderstood,
[1:44:40] remember Jesus was misunderstood."
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, that blessed me. I said, 'I'm so
[1:44:46] glad, Lord,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; that you knew the very smallest thing.
[1:44:49] We think, oh, well, we're misunderstood.
[1:44:51] No, there's much that goes with being
[1:44:53] misunderstood.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; You ever try to do something right and
[1:44:56] you know it's right, but you're
[1:44:58] misunderstood as a husband, as a wife,
[1:45:01] as children. Maybe your parents
[1:45:03] misunderstand you. Sometimes everybody
[1:45:04] misunderstands
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; your boss at work.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're trying to, you know,
[1:45:10] you said it right, but he understood it
[1:45:12] wrong.
[1:45:13] That's true. I just read that part here.
[1:45:16] It's it's not by what we read or hear.
[1:45:18] It's what our understanding is. Our
[1:45:20] discernment is of what we hear and read.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And and you see the age that we're
[1:45:26] coming in when we're talking these
[1:45:28] things. We're not talking about that.
[1:45:29] Hey, it's over right now. Look, I we
[1:45:31] thought Brother Brand was when Brother
[1:45:32] Bram died, we thought the rapture was
[1:45:34] going to take place.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We didn't even think that
[1:45:37] Brother Bram would die.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; I'm saying we I was there. We were
[1:45:43] followers of this measure with all our
[1:45:44] heart in ' 65.
[1:45:46] When he died, it was beyond our belief.
[1:45:49] We said, "Ah, he'll rise up again.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, he couldn't die. It's not finished."
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But God said it was finished.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And then God blinded the world
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; by the way he died.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; And right out of there looking
[1:46:06] is the promise of the word takes the
[1:46:08] prophet off the scene. Even so now they
[1:46:11] cannot deny the first and second pull.
[1:46:13] Even denominations today, you you ask
[1:46:16] any man, was brother a prophet? Did he
[1:46:18] have visions? Did he have miracles
[1:46:19] inside? Oh, he said there was a nothing
[1:46:21] greater than in in all of in all of life
[1:46:24] than the ministry of William Brham's
[1:46:25] divine healing ministry.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; They knew that when he stood there and
[1:46:32] began to discern the thoughts, the
[1:46:33] intents of the heart, that wasn't a man.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. when he told them where they come
[1:46:36] from, what they come for, and why they
[1:46:38] were here, and what they should have
[1:46:39] done or shouldn't didn't do.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; They knew he was a vindicated prophet.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Now, they have to find an answer.
[1:46:48] Brother Bram said, "Let it go 50 years
[1:46:50] and they'll start saying, "Oh, Brother
[1:46:52] Brham was a man, mighty man of God."
[1:46:54] Within 50 years, I noticed it because I
[1:46:57] lived long enough. I said, "Uhoh, now
[1:46:59] they're beginning to say he was a man of
[1:47:01] God." But
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; God loved him so much that he took him
[1:47:06] out of the way because he went off the
[1:47:08] word at the end. When he went to the
[1:47:10] third pull, yeah, he went off the word
[1:47:13] as far as they're concerned.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; But that's when the word caught the
[1:47:15] bride.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the word caught the
[1:47:19] bride.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; She's not she's not deceived.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Oh no,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; she's not blind. She's not walking in
[1:47:26] blindness. She's walking in the light.
[1:47:28] And you notice when brother Bam got gone
[1:47:30] to that third pole, he said, "Now
[1:47:31] remember this is not to the world."
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I I would like to spread it to the whole
[1:47:36] world.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was so excited." He said,
[1:47:38] "Watch the first pull, second pull." He
[1:47:40] said, "This third pull, don't try to
[1:47:43] explain it."
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And when you hear ministers try to
[1:47:46] explain the third pull alto together, be
[1:47:49] careful.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Be careful. There's an element of
[1:47:54] revelation that lays there waiting for
[1:47:56] God as it unfolds.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Don't be ahead of God.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Just stay right with him.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; There's an element of revelation that
[1:48:04] goes with the revelation.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; And it moves on and we're right in it
[1:48:08] now. We've been there. Be very careful.
[1:48:11] We as ministers, we we we stir ourselves
[1:48:13] up daily. I I'm fading off the scene,
[1:48:15] but you younger ministers, watch.
[1:48:16] Because what little bit we sow, right or
[1:48:18] wrong,
[1:48:20] we picked up on our grandchildren.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; And if it's off a little bit, by the
[1:48:26] look, when you fire a rifle and you go
[1:48:29] 25 yards, you know, they tell you to
[1:48:32] start with about 25 yards because you're
[1:48:33] bound to hit the target in 25 yards. Or
[1:48:36] if it's off a quarter of an inch, you
[1:48:38] shoot a couple of times. Yeah. Quarter
[1:48:40] an inch to the left.
[1:48:42] You turn it. They said, "Ah, yeah, there
[1:48:44] it is. Right on." Now I got zero but a
[1:48:47] little bit to the left a little bit but
[1:48:48] it's only quarter inch. Now you put it
[1:48:51] 200 yards and you lay it there again and
[1:48:54] shoot the same way you'd be about four
[1:48:56] inches off
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; out of the range. Anything that's more
[1:49:01] than a quarter or tw you don't you go
[1:49:04] back to the drawing board.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Listen what we plant
[1:49:10] what we plant in our homes
[1:49:12] our children reap. So plant right,
[1:49:15] husband and wife.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; The ring of fire
[1:49:21] is stirring. You know that when brother
[1:49:23] Bam talks about the ring of fire said,
[1:49:24] "Look at all that." It's it's any thing.
[1:49:26] And even this morning while we're here,
[1:49:28] while we're sitting here, do you know
[1:49:31] we've never been closer to a nuclear war
[1:49:34] than we are right now?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it'll only take one
[1:49:39] fanatic one of these days.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. and put a finger on the trigger of
[1:49:44] nuclear weaponry.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And if you notice the attitude and he
[1:49:48] says this, I believe that God raised up
[1:49:50] Russia to drop a bomb on the Vatican and
[1:49:54] on America.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; that's what he says.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; The seventh vision was annihilated was a
[1:50:02] he said it was a burnt over ashes.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; He says as far as I could see.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:08] Do you know there's a man right now on
[1:50:11] the earth, his name is Putin
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; in Russia
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; who's being stroked the wrong way.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; By our greatest politicians and by by
[1:50:20] the world.
[1:50:22] It's going to get him angry one of these
[1:50:23] days.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; But there's got to be a bride that
[1:50:26] leaves here before that happens.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're sitting?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; You see where we're positionally placed?
[1:50:35] It's a glorious church
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle. She's washed in
[1:50:40] the blood of the lamb.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; It's a glorious church without spot or
[1:50:47] wrinkle. She's washed in the blood of
[1:50:51] the lamb. Let the musicians come up. Let
[1:50:53] me sing that once. It's a glorious
[1:50:56] church without spar wrinkle. She's
[1:51:00] washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:51:05] Oh, it's a glorious church without spot
[1:51:10] wrinkle cuz she's washed in the blood of
[1:51:14] the lamb. It's a glorious church without
[1:51:20] a wrinkle. Cuz she's walked in the blood
[1:51:24] of the lamb
[1:51:27] with the glorious church without spot.
[1:51:33] Walk in the blood of the lamb.
[1:51:38] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[1:51:42] passing through. My treasures are laid
[1:51:45] out somewhere beyond the blue. All the
[1:51:49] angels beckon to me from heaven.
[1:51:54] And I can't feel at home in this world
[1:51:59] anymore.
[1:52:01] Oh Lord, you know that I have no like
[1:52:05] you. If heaven is not my home, then
[1:52:09] Lord, what would I do? the angel back
[1:52:15] from
[1:52:17] and I can't feel that home
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:24] just over in glory land
[1:52:29] eternally.
[1:52:30] The saints of every hand they're
[1:52:34] shouting victory.
[1:52:36] The sound of sweetest praise rings back
[1:52:40] heaven shore and I can't
[1:52:46] anymore
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:58] the angels
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:04] and I
[1:53:05] feel at home in this world and
[1:53:10] Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you today for your
[1:53:13] goodness.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; this world is truly not our home.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for all the
[1:53:18] blessings and those things. We do not
[1:53:20] take them for granted, Lord.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; We thank you.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And if there's any needy person here,
[1:53:25] Lord, let them anchor their soul
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; in the haven of rest. Lord,
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; there's someone that's never known you
[1:53:32] in the power of your resurrection. They
[1:53:34] don't know what it's like to be born of
[1:53:35] the spirit. Lord, if there's a thirst in
[1:53:38] their heart, quicken it. Bring them to
[1:53:41] life. Take away the guilt. Let the blood
[1:53:44] of Jesus Christ wash them whiter than
[1:53:46] the driven snow.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; If there's others that are sick and
[1:53:50] body,
[1:53:51] maybe parents struggling financially,
[1:53:56] domestic problems,
[1:53:58] home problems.
[1:54:01] The nation that we're in, Lord, is
[1:54:03] hardly a a church, a nation that isn't
[1:54:05] affected
[1:54:07] through many dangerous toils and snares.
[1:54:09] We have already come.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; But it's grace that brought us safe thus
[1:54:14] far.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And grace will lead us through
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; when we've been there 10,000 years,
[1:54:22] bright, shining as the sun, we'll have
[1:54:24] no less days to sing God's praise
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; than when we first begun. Bless this
[1:54:29] tabernacle. The pastors, the deacons,
[1:54:31] the trustee, the musicians, the
[1:54:34] laborers, the moms, the dads, the
[1:54:35] children.
[1:54:37] Let the power of the resurrection
[1:54:41] be their daily meat.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Feed them with things that that's pure
[1:54:46] and holy of this message. Lord,
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; we know where to go. This little bride
[1:54:50] has the devil's answer.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; She knows. She's set on Christ, the
[1:54:55] solid rock.
[1:54:56] All other sand is sinking sand.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; All other ground
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; is sinking sand.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; As the writer said, "My hope is built on
[1:55:07] nothing less."
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; That's where I stand, Lord.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, if we're wrong, correct us.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; chasen us severely, Lord, till we line
[1:55:17] up with your word for your love. Lord,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be chasened by you
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; than by the devil, Lord. chasing us in
[1:55:25] your own way. Bring us into subjection
[1:55:28] in every way.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we might never quite meet like
[1:55:31] this again.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But it's been good to be here, Lord,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; this weekend
[1:55:37] with this le lady. And I pray that
[1:55:40] you'll bless all your children as we
[1:55:43] separate from this building today. May
[1:55:46] you be in every home, and every
[1:55:49] situation
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; as I commit them to you in Jesus
[1:55:52] Christ's name.
[1:55:53] Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing less than
[1:56:03] Jesus love and his righteousness.
[1:56:08] I cannot trust the street,
[1:56:13] but holy,
[1:56:16] [Music]
[1:56:20] but on Christ
[1:56:24] rock I stand. All other ground
[1:56:29] is sinking sand. All the ground is
[1:56:37] stand.
[1:56:39] God bless you. It's been good to be
[1:56:41] here. I thank my brother for I didn't
[1:56:45] feel like it was a privilege at first,
[1:56:47] but I glad I did. You know how it always
[1:56:51] is. The flesh is weak, but the spirit is
[1:56:53] growing.
[1:56:55] I want to honor one family. Where's
[1:56:57] Brother Paul at? Did he Did he leave
[1:56:59] already?
[1:57:02] big as life. There you are. God bless
[1:57:04] you for your you got your 44th year
[1:57:08] coming up. God bless you. Doesn't seem
[1:57:11] like maybe I got to tell a little
[1:57:13] something. We were very happy when he
[1:57:16] was born. He was life in our grandma and
[1:57:19] grandpa's home.
[1:57:21] Paul, you were very important then. You
[1:57:22] still are important. Love you. Love your
[1:57:25] family. Love you all. You're all part of
[1:57:27] the family of God. God bless you. Pray
[1:57:30] for us in Saskatoon. We pray for you
[1:57:33] here. Shalom.
[1:57:35] God bless you.
[1:57:37] Love you.
[1:57:43] Hey.
[1:57:46] Amen. You know,
[1:57:48] something else that I forgot to mention
[1:57:50] and I really want to um is that we have
[1:57:54] uh in our midst, we know that it's
[1:57:56] Christ that we celebrate.
[1:57:59] But in just an in honorable mention, we
[1:58:02] have two of the believers, the original
[1:58:04] believers music group in our midst here,
[1:58:07] brother Menel Fzen and brother Abe Dole.
[1:58:10] Certainly thankful to have you here,
[1:58:12] brother A.
[1:58:19] Now, I don't know if Brother Abees sang,
[1:58:21] but I certainly know he played the steel
[1:58:23] guitar. And unfortunately, we don't have
[1:58:25] one here. Otherwise, we'd be asking for
[1:58:27] a special, but just wanted to mention
[1:58:30] it, brother. God richly bless you. We're
[1:58:32] certainly honored to have you with us,
[1:58:33] Brother Gourd. Thank you for bringing
[1:58:35] him and each and everyone for making the
[1:58:37] effort to come out today. Did Did you
[1:58:39] hear from your theophony today?
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord? You know, I
[1:58:43] heard one thing today and I'm sure we
[1:58:45] all did. I think it's so important. This
[1:58:47] is the only part that I'm going to
[1:58:48] preach and then I I believe we've got
[1:58:50] some time. So, I want to sing.
[1:58:54] But, you know, the one thing that I
[1:58:55] heard I heard it three distinct maybe
[1:58:57] even four, but at least three times.
[1:59:00] It's the only thing that really matters
[1:59:03] is what is our discernment of what is
[1:59:06] being said.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So, what did we hear today?
[1:59:12] What did we hear today? I I heard that,
[1:59:14] you know what? There's a madman on the
[1:59:16] throne in Russia that a prophet declared
[1:59:19] when it was still called USSR.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Watch Russia, the king of the north. And
[1:59:24] here we have that madman. Brother
[1:59:26] Brandham says one day someone will just
[1:59:28] have one too many sips of vodka and push
[1:59:31] the button. But we heard we heard today
[1:59:34] that before that happens, the bride goes
[1:59:36] home.
[1:59:39] What a privilege that is.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; What's our discernment of hearing that?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach get the Holy Ghost
[1:59:46] because without the Holy Ghost, we're
[1:59:48] going to be in those ashes.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to live through that or die
[1:59:53] through it.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; But to have the Holy Ghost, we will
[1:59:57] actually be in that rapture. And you
[1:59:58] know, that's the only way we'll be in
[2:00:00] that rapture. There ain't no other
[2:00:01] interpretations. The vindicated
[2:00:03] prophetic utterance to this age was get
[2:00:06] the Holy Ghost so that you don't have
[2:00:08] to.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; He's not going to judge his bride. His
[2:00:10] bride has already been judged. She
[2:00:12] judged herself according to the word.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; And because of that, she's given
[2:00:17] discernment about what that prophet
[2:00:19] said. My goodness.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Can we sing that song?
[2:00:23] Let's talk about Jesus. We okay to sing
[2:00:26] for a few minutes.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; If anybody feels pressured that you do
[2:00:30] need to go, you're certainly welcome to.
[2:00:31] We certainly don't judge here. Um,
[2:00:34] remember we've got a potluck for those
[2:00:36] people who don't have somewhere to go
[2:00:38] for lunch. Just uh ask one of us before
[2:00:40] you leave here. I know that there's
[2:00:42] another gathering on on the the Boyer
[2:00:45] side and we're certainly sad because
[2:00:47] we're not going to fellowship over
[2:00:48] lunch, but you know, we had some
[2:00:50] spiritual lunch this morning. So, we're
[2:00:52] certainly thankful.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Is that Sister Pamela back there?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Sister Pamela Kronhite. God bless you.
[2:00:57] Did you bring your husband? No, he's not
[2:01:00] here. God bless you. It's good to see
[2:01:01] you. Let's talk about Jesus. Let's talk
[2:01:05] about Jesus,

[2:11:30] Glory to God.
[2:11:35] Amen. Let's just bow in prayer one more
[2:11:37] time. Gracious heavenly father, Lord
[2:11:40] Jesus, it's been good to be here with
[2:11:43] you.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that we had a man speak
[2:11:48] to us, but we know the inspiration
[2:11:51] behind that man is you.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that
[2:11:56] we believe in a five-fold ministry that
[2:11:58] you have ordained for your church, Lord.
[2:12:01] Not for the idea of getting together a
[2:12:04] great organization, but for the
[2:12:06] perfecting of the saints, Lord. That is
[2:12:09] your word. And we're so thankful for
[2:12:10] your direction. We're so thankful for
[2:12:13] your leadership, Lord. Thank you for the
[2:12:15] direction in the homes, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, for the husband's position,
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; for the wives position, for the
[2:12:23] children's position, in the church, Lord
[2:12:26] Jesus, all of the positions. We know
[2:12:28] that you're a God of order, and we're so
[2:12:30] thankful that you've given us direction
[2:12:32] for that, Lord.
[2:12:34] Help us Lord Jesus to understand that we
[2:12:38] cannot understand. The only way that we
[2:12:41] can understand the word for our day is
[2:12:44] by your spirit living out through us,
[2:12:47] discerning that word. Lord, help us to
[2:12:50] surrender our will to die out to
[2:12:52] ourselves. Oh father, as your prophet
[2:12:55] said to us in the invisible union to
[2:12:57] write a bill of divorcement to ourselves
[2:13:00] so that you could live inside of us so
[2:13:02] that our old husband could be dead.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Oh father, that we don't live in an
[2:13:07] adulterous existence thinking that we're
[2:13:09] saved and we're actually lost.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to surrender our lives
[2:13:14] fresh unto you every single day of our
[2:13:16] lives. Lord, let us die to ourselves
[2:13:19] daily as Paul said that you will live.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we pray for brother Menow
[2:13:24] and sister Irene that you would just
[2:13:26] continue to pour yourself out to them
[2:13:28] and through them. Lord, bless them
[2:13:30] abundantly. Father, bless their marriage
[2:13:33] of 63 years, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; What a privilege. What a blessing. Lord,
[2:13:39] we pray for the saints back in Saskatoon
[2:13:41] at Saskatoon Tabernacle. Lord, we just
[2:13:44] stand with Brother Dwayne and Sister
[2:13:46] Connie and all the saints there, Father,
[2:13:48] that you would strengthen them and
[2:13:50] encourage them all. Bless them
[2:13:52] abundantly, Father. Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:13:54] you for all the brothers and sisters who
[2:13:56] have gathered here from the many
[2:13:58] different churches around the world.
[2:14:00] Father, bless them abundantly as well.
[2:14:03] And all of our visitors, Father, if
[2:14:04] there's anybody here that doesn't know
[2:14:06] you in the power of your resurrection,
[2:14:08] the way that we're speaking, Father, I
[2:14:10] pray right now that they would desire to
[2:14:13] know you that way. Father, that they
[2:14:15] would decide to surrender their will for
[2:14:17] the first time maybe ever, Lord, and
[2:14:20] allow you to manifest yourself. We know
[2:14:22] that you're a gentleman.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; You don't want to abuse your wife.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; You want to love her.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful for your love,
[2:14:31] Lord.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Today, we just want to commit each life
[2:14:33] now into your hands as we go our
[2:14:35] separate ways.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Father, help us to keep you as the
[2:14:39] central theme of every aspect of our
[2:14:41] lives. Lord,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; we love you and we thank you for your
[2:14:45] goodness. We just ask all these things
[2:14:47] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
