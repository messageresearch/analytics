TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you Saints when I heard about uh Sister Laura person just bothered me so much and I thought about it through other nights I was just so worried for the family knowing that I'm also a mother and I just couldn't take my mind off it then I was just asking myself I'm like why would this happen but then one thing came to my mind said Just Praise His Name and I just had that song and I said I wanted to sing it maybe it would be a blessing to someone so may God bless you as you listen [Music] when you up against the wall and the mountain seems so tall and you realize life's not always Fair you can run away and hide and let the old man decide or you can change your circumstances with a prayer foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] you just praise His name oh and you can overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony you see the darkness go as your faith begins to grow you're not alone so how can you be lonely foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] when everything falls apart praise His name when you feel you can go on just raise your hands and say Raider is he that is within me [Music] [Laughter] [Music] that is within me you can praise [Music] if you'll just praise His name
