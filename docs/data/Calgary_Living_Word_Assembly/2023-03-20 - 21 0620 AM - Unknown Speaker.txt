God bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord it's certainly tremendous to see more and more people and to know that things things are changing around here certainly thankful to be in the house of the Lord once again thankful for what he's done for each and every one of us in our lives we know it's Father's Day today and uh we know it's a bit of a cardinal celebration but as everyone has mentioned so far there is the spiritual type of Father's Day and to know I just can't help but think about it that John he was in the spirit on the original Father's Day he was able to get a glimpse of heaven and see Our Father on his throne certainly like to thank the Lord for the ability for the fathers to be who they are you know the word says to raise up a child in the way they should go train them up in the way they should go and it won't depart from them and we know many times we can look at it and see the children making their own decisions after a little while and parents can only do so much they can only go so far but they can plant the seed and it's up to God to bring that seed to life in their lives it's not up to the parents we're certainly thankful for that life that God gives us God bless you each and every father out there today certainly excited about next Sunday not to diminish today because we have a tremendous opportunity to fellowship with the king of kings and Lord of lords right here and now knowing that he is here but next Sunday Lord willing will have no restrictions the only thing that we may have will be masks if the City of Calgary keeps it we will see we'll have two Services next Sunday and next Sunday evening was supposed to be brother Gilbert and then it changed and it was going to be brother Mervin nobody knew that yet but I'm just saying and it's changed yet again if we open next week all the way I would like to have a worship service I'd like to get together Sunday evening and have a worship service I I think that we have gone through one of the greatest trials I know that I've experienced being in the ministry being in the church to think that all of the restrictions that we've had are going to be lifted now we will have the opportunity to get together as a body of believers and just worship we certainly want to be able to do that so we'll see um what the Lord has in store um we're certainly looking forward to no more restrictions seeing the church get together and uh yeah we'll see we'll see what we can do next month I think we can look for the calendar to uh to reflect regular programming I I probably got it wrong didn't I can see that I I did sorry it's the 27th I got excited once the restrictions lift the first Sunday evening service we will have a worship service and uh I just would like to get everyone together who wants to come who would like to Fellowship and uh we'll just sing we'll praise the Lord if someone has a special if you'd like to bring a special go ahead and bring it we're not really going to do a testimony service we'll save that for the communion we just like to have a real good worship service one of the things that was mentioned too uh um in our discussion was if you have a friend somebody you think might enjoy a worship service bring them bring them out let's see if we can't uh witness to some folks as well we will create a schedule and we'll make it as clear as possible on the schedule sometimes I get up here and I get nervous I get excited I apologize I don't mean to confuse anyone I'm confused enough as it is but I just want to get together and worship again and I'm certainly looking forward to that next month we'll commence Lord willing with communion foot washing will commence with Sunday School we had the discussion and typically before we would shut Sunday school down over the summer but I don't know what else we will really be doing this summer so we'll uh open up Sunday school and we'll just go fully ahead we don't know what the Lord has in store we could have another strange shutdown we'll just see so we'll have uh basically regular scheduled items for next month Sunday school Lethbridge services and we'll just see what the Lord will do Lord willing we won't have to do this very much longer we have another one praise the Lord we've got communication yes sir we put it on the calendar and uh I may have confused it maybe by not mentioning it or however but we have a comedian service tonight for anyone that would like to participate the group that's on the calendar tonight will be the ones that come to the service in the building and then everyone else if you would like to participate please just queue in the parking lot and we will start the service and filter through just like we did the last couple times with the groups of folks and uh hopefully we'll have just a convenient service tonight and uh yeah we'll have some of the the bread of life commemorate the Lord's Lord's body so happy Father's Day my brothers my sisters that's it for the announcements and uh maybe we could just have a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're just so thankful that we can be called Sons and Daughters of God behold what manner of love you have for us Lord Lord Jesus we pray that you would just bless our little service this morning pray Lord Jesus that you would just take the bread of life and break it to us fresh once again Lord that you would just speak to our very Souls Lord that you would just encourage each and every one of us father by Your Word we just ask that you would be glorified now and all that said and all that's done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to read from Saint John chapter 6. continuing on in the the Book of John maybe just a little different perspective today Saint John chapter 6. we'll start reading with verse 26. Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the Miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent then said they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what Dost thou work our fathers did eat Manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come unto me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that all of which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one of everyone which seeth the son and belieth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we thank you Lord Jesus that you are faithful and true Lord that you will always come where you're invited and Lord Jesus we know that you've been invited here we know that you're here with us and we know that you are a faithful father and that you will break this bread unto us once again father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done here now this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated so it looks like the uh sorry I just got sidetracked here talking about this uh the scripture this morning kind of goes back to where we left off last week talking about the woman at the well not of Saint John chapter 4. you know how the discussion with the woman at the well when Jesus was there he had this discussion with the woman and and the discussion he he led it into a spiritual discussion but we know the woman spoke carnally in our scripture this morning looking at this the sort of the back story here these people that were questioning Jesus were the ones that actually saw him break the bread remember the story about the the boy that had the loaves of bread and the people were wary and and they needed to eat and and the disciples said just send them away Jesus said no no let's let's feed them knowing what would happen and so it was actually the the natural typing the spiritual where he took the bread and broke it and fed the multitudes with that bread and he had leftovers these people they actually witnessed that and here they are saying to him will show us a sign show us something give us something to go on so that we could see that you are kind of who you you say you are who you claim to be and how many men in their lives had broken bread like that multiplied the loaves before in their lives but you know the same sort of thing repeats here in this scripture he he they say they say show us a sign and he says you know you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled because you were fed that's why you seek me and and hopefully you can get another free meal but you're completely missing the purpose of what happened and here you are now saying show me another sign even though it's happened already right before your very eyes so he takes them and and starts to lead them into a spiritual discussion to say hold on a second forget about the natural that was just to get your attention and then they go on to talk carnally and he speaks spiritually similar to the woman at the well only this time he's talking about bread the bread of life and at the woman at the well they were talking about water spiritual discussion and the carnal discussion the woman at the well she spoke carnally she knew spiritual things in her life remember but she had forgotten them she was raised spiritually she was taught she probably went to Sunday school she was told the scripture she understood it because as the conversation progressed between Jesus and the woman at the well she she had an understanding that hold on a second sir I perceive that thou art a prophet because we know that when Messiah comes he'll actually do the things that you're doing something's something strange about this this sounds strangely familiar to what I'm I'm remembering from from being a child but in her life we know that she had forgotten these spiritual things because of the carnality the things of her life had gotten in the way and they clogged up the channels in her life out of this day this scripture is fulfilled in 1965 brother Branham says when the little woman at the well in her immoral conditions come up a little panoramic something like this to draw some water Jesus had sent his disciples away to get vittles he didn't want his disciples to be there to be a part of this he knew what had to happen and he knew it needed to be a private conversation goes on to say and when she come up to draw water he said bring me a drink the woman said it's not customary for you to say that we have segregation here now you Jews have nothing to do with us Samaritans and we have nothing to do with you he said but woman if you knew who you were talking to you would ask me for a drink I would give you Waters you don't come here to draw he found where her condition was what it was he said go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any husband he said you've said the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not yours she said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet we know that when Messiah cometh he'll show us these things Jesus said I am he and on that she run into the City and said come see a man who's told me the things that I've done isn't this the very Messiah brother Bradham says watch he did that before the Jews and the Samaritans but never before the Gentiles and we know that this is exactly the second pull of brother branham's Ministry the discernment of the heart and and I'm not going to really get into the polls today but I just wanted to identify it with a scripture that's exactly the same thing the Discerning of the heart but the Branham says watch he Jesus did that before the Jews and the Samaritans but he never did it before the Gentiles until the end of time until the prophet for our day came on the scene it wasn't done to the Gentiles the Gentiles we people were heathens in them days brother Branham says the other nations packed a club on our back worshiping Idols we wasn't looking for no Messiah he only appears to those who's looking for him and we're supposed to be looking for him it almost sounds like a contradiction the way he says this he only appears to those who's looking for him and we're supposed to be looking for him but those who claim to be looking for him the church itself when they seen that done they said he's a devil he's a fortune teller of Beelzebub and Jesus said that sin would be forgiven them because he hadn't denied he hadn't died yet but someday the Holy Ghost will come and do the same thing and speak one word against it will never be forgiven and he says that's this day where every word has to hang together speak a word against it it'll never be forgiven in this world or the world to come it's alarming when you read this and you think about the number of people that have spoken against the message of the hour that have spoken against the prophet for our day because he didn't come in his name he didn't come in his ministry he didn't come trying to take people and show them something new or different he came in the name of the father he came with the word of God for our day and and he said it so many times it's later than we think you know talking about the the scripture in John chapter 4 in the in the scripture in John chapter 6 we'll actually spend a little bit of time in John chapter 6. um we'll see how far we get today with it but the carnal versus the spiritual discussion how how Jesus he used when he was here he would use the natural to type the spiritual he would use a simple statement like bring me a drink or get me a drink and the woman would would begin to explain all the reasons why not and and it's interesting to think that the the carnal versus the spiritual it can happen to us in our day as we live our lives we contend with with all of the carnality in church we tend with the carnality in our homes and our our lives and our families but yet the spiritual is running parallel all the way along sometimes we have to take a step backwards and take a look at the big picture as we've heard it said many times and not get caught up in in in the Small Things the carnal things it can be very easy to get distracted and to see the the channels get clogged up you know there's a there's a there's a scripture in Luke chapter 10. where Jesus talks about the carnal and the spiritual and and it's an interesting sort of description of the situation in in Luke chapter 10 verse 40. I'll just read it for the sake of time this morning it's about Martha and Mary and and having Jesus in the home and and and and and fellowshipping with the King of Kings but Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said Lord thus not thou care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she should help me and Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her imagine how that must have felt for her for Martha to be so caught up in fussing and trying to make everything perfect and and going and getting and bringing and doing and and making it just perfect for the master while he was there and and seeing her sister just sit back and and and have all the fun and and take in all of the teachings of the master you know this this just stirs up some memories for me I remember brother Ken preaching a real good service about this very scripture here and how we can get so caught up in our lives thinking that we need to be doing and and acting and and bringing and getting and and making it happen instead of just sitting at the Master's feet and allowing him to wash us with the water of the word the carnal and the spiritual sometimes we can get caught up being a little carnal and trying to make it happen when we really shouldn't be when we should be allowing the Lord to bring it to pass in our lives speaking about this bread of life we can uh take a look at verse 26 how how Jesus said you seek me you seek me so that you can eat but you're really not seeing the full picture today you're just thinking about the carnal side of things and you know it's interesting that brother Branham talked about it in his day how a church it got to the place with with the doctrines of men that they brought in how the churches they needed to go after people in a carnal way and and have soup kitchens and and have fellowships where they feed the people and and and sell meals to the people to try and raise money so that the church could carry on but if they were actually not doing sort of the the carnal if they would take a step back and look at it from the spiritual they would be able to preach the word in its fullness if they could do that then the Lord would actually look after all the rest of it but instead the churches try and make it happen carnally speaking and we need to be careful that way ourselves in our lives we can try and do that in our marriages try and make it happen but we have scriptural principles if we just follow those and allow the Lord to do it then it will work same thing with our children we can try and save our children but that's not going to work it will only go so far our children will conform for a Time but that word needs to come to pass in their lives and if you've trained them up in the way they shall go God's word will not be defeated Satan will come around and try and say to us maybe oh look at them look at their lives look at look at the testimony that they're they're living it won't change God's word God's word can't be stopped God's word will come to pass it has to but we can get caught up trying to do the carnal looking at the carnal observing the carnal and and missing the entire big picture of what God's doing you know the entire world is caught up in looking at the carnal right now and and totally looking at all of the carnality that's going on it's it's amazing to think that a prophet a Vindicated Prophet has come in this day and the world has just rejected them just completely rejected them and and he came and even preached the message indictment he indicts this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ but this bread of life that we're talking about today he says to these people you seek me just so that you can eat so that you can fill your bellies and and look after the the carnal side of things but you're you're not seeing the full picture I I broke that bread and fed the multitude of people Naturally Speaking but you know what they're all going to hunger again they're all going to be hungry very soon he said labor not for the natural but labor for the spiritual the spiritual that shall come from the Son of Man it parallels the son of man Ministry today what Jesus was talking about there in verse 28 they say to him what shall we do it's very interesting because it's it's kind of like John chapter 4 verse 14 4 15 chapter 4 verse 15 the woman at the well she said give give me of this water let me try it the way that you're talking about in in sort of a a cynical way you know maybe I don't have to draw water the way that I used to that I could just get away from all of this carnality but the people said to him what shall we do and he told them exactly what you need to do all you need to do is believe he said the same thing to the woman at the well she said we know that when Messiah come he'll do all these things and he said I who talk to you am he he told her in Acts chapter 2. you know the people they heard a sermon preached after the the falling of the the Holy Spirit Peter went out under the influence of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit giving utterance he spoke to them and he said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye hath both crucified both Lord and Christ and now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do what how can we how can we do something about this there's got to be something carnally that we can do to make this right then said Peter unto them repent to be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and all those that are afar off even as many as the Lord Our God should call they were given the opportunity to do the comparison between the natural and the spiritual and then they were given the instruction on how to actually act on it when they asked they had the desire in their heart what should we do how can we do something about this how can we make it right out of Harvest Time talking about this uh this bread of life brother Branham speaking here he says we we thinking of this that him saying himself now that I am the bread of life now how could this man be the bread of life we're speaking out of John John chapter 6 here how how could this man be the bread of life that's what we wonder my body is bread he said and now how could this man be bred that's kind of strange but don't be puzzled by it I love how how he just explains this here don't be puzzled by it people of his time they got puzzled about it they didn't know how that this man could actually be bred himself how how could this man this is me speaking now how could this man say that you know he that believeth on me as the as the scriptures said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water the natural and then the spiritual back to the Natural again he just did the comparisons and Drew the parallels also in Saint John 1 it is given to us this way brother Brown speaking here that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the word became the bread and remember as we've talked about that scripture that we just read out of Saint John 1 there's a bunch of verses in between the two verses it's not just those two verses also in Saint John 1 it is given to us this way that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the word became bread brother Brown I'm speaking here the word and the bread here would have to be the same because Jesus is the word and he is the bread now how could he be bread and word it would be puzzling to the carnal mind he goes on to say but we're hoping this morning that there's no carnal Minds Among Us that there is a spiritual mind Among Us that we could understand what the father is trying to get to us here and you might be saying we're trying to understand what the father might be trying to get to us here through brother Berry what are you trying to say here I'll I'll just say it plainly the only way that I could say it is that he Compares himself carnally to the spiritually he'll he'll use a carnal type to get our attention to bring us to the spiritual word he says but we're hoping here this morning that there's no carnal Minds Among Us that there is a spiritual mind Among Us what does he say in the word let this mind be in you which was also in Christ that's the mind we're talking about today his mind that there is a spiritual mind Among Us that we could understand what the father is trying to get to us here see these words are puzzling but at the same time they are scriptural truths see I just love the way the prophet for our Day brings this he makes it understandable in a way that I feel like I could understand it you know Jesus here in in John chapter 6 he says labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meech meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed today brothers and sisters we have been given the ability to see the full picture back in that day in Jesus day when he was there with those those folks that saw him break the bread and break the Loaves and multiply it and see all the many signs and wonders in Jesus life they couldn't see the full picture they could only see part of the picture and and up until the day that we had a prophet Vindicated on earth once again we only saw a partial picture but you know there's a group of people we know this who have been given the ability to see the full picture and it's no longer a partial picture for some folks it still is a partial picture and you know I'm not going to make any bones about it not everyone is at the same spiritual walk I think it was brother Tom Ernest that said it we live in a in a one-room schoolhouse there's people that are professors and there's people who are in pre-preschool here everyone is at a different level of walk and there's nothing wrong with that that's according to the choice of the father and we would never want to actually treat anybody any different than the way the Lord would want them to be treated we would that everyone would come to the knowledge of the truth in our day amen but we've been given the ability to see the full picture if we want to look at it you know since the Book of Genesis the world has only ever seen half a rainbow I thought that was astounding when I heard that since since the book of since the world began the world has only ever seen half of a rainbow since the Book of Genesis but you know the prophet for our day has taken us right into the throne room of almighty God the scripture that was actually written that everybody studied and learned throughout all of the ages it was a hidden Mystery but it's not hidden Mystery anymore I hear some some people speak about the message of the hour as though it still is a hidden Mystery and I'm not talking about people here I'm speaking about Ministry and and it's amazing because it's almost like they say it in such a way that it can cause a gathering around the the thought that they have in in their lives and and maybe the gift that God has given them and I'm certainly not trying to throw off on anybody what I am saying is that it's not a hidden Mystery any longer once upon a time it was a hidden Mystery we know that all of the Mysteries have been revealed in our day but the prophet for our day has taken us right into the throne room of almighty God in in the Book of Revelations if we read the church age book we can see this picture painted and he's shown for the first time through the son of man Ministry now we know that Jesus spoke about being the son of man when the son of man was with you but now we're talking about the son of man Ministry the son of man Ministry is painting the whole entire picture but you know brother Branham speaks about it in one of the messages how important it is to understand the perspective we need to take to the entire picture unless we come God's provided way we will not see the entire picture we'll just look at it and say well there is a cloud or we'll say there's a yeah there's a halo over his head in the Houston Coliseum and and that's God's man and you know it was documented and it's great the FBI has a picture and says it and and it's in the the FBI Hall of Fame and and yeah it's great but there's others that will say you know there's something about that there's something about that that means way more than what the whole world actually looks at and sees it's not just a Halo it's the pillar of fire over top of the servant of God who is actually trying to be made a mockery of but we know his word says that God will not be mocked openly in front of all of the nominational world there Dr Beth said that he would attack his hide to his study wall can you imagine that we just read that that you know there's some things that just won't be forgiven in this world or the world to come there certainly will be some answers one day but for the first time through the son of man Ministry we've been able to see the full picture understanding of why the carnal representation to give us the spiritual direction to give us the spiritual explanation in Revelations 4 verse 3 the one that sat on the throne he wasn't surrounded by half a rainbow was he he was surrounded by a full rainbow and it was the prophet for our day that actually brought that truth to us and I mean there's many truths I'm not going to try and get into all of them I'm not going to deny their there is a lot of truth but I'm just trying to make an illustration through this Vindicated prophet he gave us the ability to see our father the way that he wanted us to see him in our day again in Revelations 10 1 it was a rainbow that was around the head of the one who descended and put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea this is a Vindicated Prophet messenger who brought these truths to us who gave us the ability to see these things which gives us the ability to see the whole picture but again it comes back to us understanding that we have to have the right perspective we can't hold on to our former teachings we can't hold on to our our pride and say this is what I've known for years we've got to be willing to to to learn more and even when we get to the place where where we know that we know that we're saved God still wants to take us and grow us he wants to take us and polish us up because we are his victory we are the gems in his crown and until we actually go to the other side he's going to keep polishing us and keep working on us and keep chiseling away the rough edges on our lives every one of us has to go through that but what makes it easier in our lives is surrender when we can just surrender to the word then we don't have as much of a struggle we know that it's it's not easy our lives are definitely not easy it's not a cakewalk but we know that his word says that my yoke is easy and my burden is light and you know what I've heard it said and I probably said it before but somebody said somewhere along the way that we're going to fight our way to heaven or we're going to fight our way to Hell one of those two things is going to happen but we're going to fight our way in this life it's not going to be easy you know as a Christian especially as a Christian we are not living in a flowery bed of ease if we truly have the ability to see the full picture then Satan is going to do everything that he can I've said it before to throw banana peels in our path to trip us up to try and keep us from actually coming to the full realization it doesn't matter if we're on our faith if we're on our back if we're upside down if we're under water it doesn't matter he will not lose one of his own but Satan will take us and get us caught up in the situation in the carnal moment and take us and get us so distracted from the big picture that's actually happening in our lives that we'll just forget like that woman at the well will let a little bit of something get in the way of our lives and and we can forget what the whole picture really is brothers and sisters today we're dealing with the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in this world I think you know I've I've had it said to me uh in many different ways and I've tried to be able to articulate it and say it but I think that it's becoming clear and clearer to me myself and that what we've witnessed in our day and I say it many times the coming of the lord we know that's the third pull the opening of the word there's only one that had the ability to actually take the book out of the hand that him of him that sat on the throne and that was the lamb and that's the only one who had the ability to actually loose the seals thereof we know that so if we've had the seals opened in our day who opened those seals what we've witnessed in our day brothers and sisters is the spiritual coming of the Lord and we know that he will come again in his physical body but his physical body isn't going to walk on earth his physical body is going to meet us in the clouds and it's all part of the same thing it's just become super clear to me but to look at it and think that cloud in 1963 the coming of the Lord sunset Mountain it wasn't just a cloud it wasn't just a sign it was actually the Lord Jesus Christ descending with a shout with an open book in his hand but here we have in our day the Vindicated Prophet messenger who surrendered his will to do the fathers completely he went through all kinds of things that we probably have no idea about just like many men who have packed the message through the years he bought the truth about those loose ends about the gospel and and what he did was he Shone a light on on the word allowing us to see what the father's will is for us in our day to give us the ability to see things that people desire to see throughout the ages that that prophets desired to look upon throughout the ages that even angels desired to see here we are today with the ability to just listen to it to speak it Paul said that he was caught up into a place where it wasn't even lawful to repeat the things that he heard said but brothers and sisters we've been brought up into a place also where it's lawful for us to say those things to speak the words that have been hidden throughout all of the ages it's no longer a mystery this Prophet came and he Shone a light the same light that John the Baptist used I say it that way because there was no flashlights in John the Baptist day but remember in the book of Saint John speaking about John the Baptist he spoke about a light that John the Baptist bore witness of but John the Baptist wasn't that light and in our day brother Branham wasn't that light but both of those Brothers bore witness of that light and we know that light that we speak about it's not a light as we see light as we we look at the Sun and we see light it's more than light it's actually life it's the life of the Lord Jesus Christ but this this prophet in our day he Shone a light on the word allowing us to see the father's will I just find that statement that's a note that I wrote down I find that statement just astounding to even speak to think that we have been given the ability to understand what the father's will is for our day to understand what the father's will is in our lives and you know he said it back here in John labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do what's what might work what what excuse me then they said unto him what shall we do that we might do the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent so if we take that and look at it there all they had to do was believe on him as the Christ the anointed one the Messiah for their day that's all they had to do there so today when we look at it the spiritual coming of the Lord what is our instruction for today brothers and sisters just believe on him this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent who did he send in our day all we have to do is take the prophet's message and believe it but you know the devil he Creeps in to the framework of the Christian church and he causes it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless through the Creeds of man through the doctrines of men men get ideas and they surround themselves with them you know I just I just have to say thanks be to God for brothers who pack the truth who speak the truth this world is so full of people not speaking the truth and and I don't mean that around the message I'm certainly not saying that about the message I would that every single minister of the message would speak the truth that's not up to me to discern I'm not going to say that about any man it's up to God I know for sure that if you just give a man enough rope he will show exactly what's inside of him that's the way it works we can't actually put someone in or put someone out just encourage a brother show them love and see what happens I don't know what just happened there I apologize it's okay brother Branham was given the ability to shine a light on on the word allowing us to see what the father's will is and what was the theme song for the prophet in our day only believe just believe when you call on his name we sang that song Touching Jesus it's all that matters the rest of it it doesn't matter the whole entire world all the cares of this life it really doesn't matter the only thing that we have to do in our life is just touch Jesus and how do we do that it's just by believing when we call on his name but you know how can we actually get to that place in our lives the only way we can do it is through a Vindicated prophet in our day and many people would say that's that's not true I have my church I have my traditions I have my religion I've been baptized I've done everything all the way throughout my life and remember there was one that actually spoke to Jesus about that and Jesus he said he had a great conversation with them Jesus saw him run after him and he he marveled at him and and and he said Master I've done everything in my life what should I do that I would have eternal life and he said you know there's one thing that you lack you still have all this carnality around your life how about you just take it all and give it to the poor and take up your cross and follow me and you'll have exactly what you want and you know what he couldn't let go of all that carnality all of his father's tradition all of his daddy's business all of the life that he lives everything that he thought that he knew God told him right there in flesh just put it all aside forget about all of it and follow me and if you would have done that he would have been able to actually inherit eternal life but because he couldn't let go of that tradition because he couldn't let go of all of that carnality in his life the word says that he lifted up his eyes in hell and he saw the beggar Lazarus on on the other side of the chasm in in Abraham's bosom and it's interesting because the same carnality it's isn't it amazing how brother Branham Vindicated Prophet for our day he says you don't change anything when you go from here to there the only thing you do is change your body who you are here is who you are there if you look at that story he was exactly the same as he was here he had servants here and what did he do immediately he said to Abraham get him to go and get me some water because I'm in torment what immediately serve me thinking about himself carnality my all we have to do is believe brothers and sisters and here we have been given the ability to see what the father's will is its only believe only believe this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent if we can believe in the message of the hour if we can believe that God could send a prophet and and take the word that that Prophet brought us and follow it we have the ability to see eternal life you know understanding trying to understand the first and then the second pulls and finally the third pull just to understand that every one of those polls they were not of men not one of them was about man but they're all leading towards something they were they were the bait on the hook is what the prophet said I think brother Bosworth actually said that to brother Branham it's just the bait on the hook it's the the healing campaign to get the attention of the people so that they could say well who else could do this sort of thing no man can heal has to be of God but it was so that one thing could happen so that they could see the opening of the word and you know when that happened when the opening of the word actually began to happen they rejected it it was no different than Jesus in his day we could go on and read here in in John chapter 6. I don't think we will for time's sake right now maybe we'll pick up tonight but exactly the same thing the discussion that he gets into with these people explaining to him that he's the bread of life and unless they come through him they will never see eternal life but they had a preconceived notion about the way things should be according to their tradition it's it's wonderful to say that we can actually look at the word and understand what the father's will is and his will is his word just to apply his word but to understand the first and the second and finally the third pulse in in in the prophet's message that they were not of a man it was so that we could see the opening of the word and to realize to be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the height and the depth and the breadth and the width of it to realize the second coming of the Lord is the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age it's the spiritual coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled if we were to listen to those messages brother Branham says it very clearly in there this is God Almighty unveiling himself how many people remembers when brother Ken brought this I hope this is okay sister Shelley we've talked about this and uh how many people remembers brother Ken he did this it's so vivid he brought this thing and he had it sitting here and he had it veiled he had a veil over it sort of like a description of the Mighty God unveiled and and it was it was covered and it was a mystery and nobody could understand what it was and he asked what do you think it is and what do you think it is and what do you think it is just a graphic description of the Mighty God unveiled and nobody knew but there came a time where the veil was lifted and brothers and sisters in our day through the message of a Vindicated Prophet The Mighty veil has the Mighty God has been unveiled the veil has been removed it's no longer a mystery to realize the second coming of the Lord is the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age and that makes it really broad to think about it that that it's it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age there's a lot of people that would say that yes indeed that's that's exactly what it is that's the second coming of the Lord but you know it's not going to be a public show that's what the prophet said when he had the vision of the tent remember the vision of the tent and the angel of the Lord said it's not going to be a public show the people would go in they would go in crippled and and then they'd come out the other side of that tent healed it's not going to be a public show this is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ not just to this age but to a very specific group of people to those people who have been foreign before the foundation of the world to be able to receive the word those people who actually have like we said that see Gene of God forgive me for spitting that's the one thing about this that I'm not going to miss when we get excited and we're speaking then we don't actually get to see the spray but anyways Lord willing when the restrictions come down I think we will probably one of the first things we'll do is remove these but maybe we shouldn't actually for the amount of times I see myself spit I apologize if anybody ever experiences that we certainly want the news and not the weather but to realize the second coming of the Lord brothers and sisters is the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age but more so it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to the individual that's what brother Bradham said that that's what the true New Birth is and that's really where we live it's one thing for everyone to say it's a great message of God it's it's great you could look up William Bradham on on Wikipedia or or whatever it is Google and and you would see that he was a mighty man of God and everyone would say bless God he he was a great man he had a mighty Healing Ministry and everything was good in his life except for that one thing where he sort of went off on the word you know and and that that that one thing where he went off on the word where the world would say that's what happened with him that is truly the opening of the word that's where things just start getting good in our lives because he was showing us that it wasn't just the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age anymore it was the revelation of Jesus Christ to the individual the ability to truly get baptized with the Holy Spirit on the sole level to realize the unveiling of God to realize the second coming of the Lord to realize that there is a true relationship between God and man again to realize that all that Adam had lost had now been restored back to the prophet no not to the prophet to man the son of man Ministry is to put the word of God as an open book back in the hand of men so that we could actually speak the word ourselves why cry speak know that he has it all under control know that everything that goes on in our lives all the carnal situations that we see he has it all under control and you know either he does or he doesn't it's not part way not sometimes he does sometimes he doesn't sometimes he's at work and everything is all under control and other times God just goes on vacation and things just get out of hand they just go crazy no he's always on the job always on the job and forgive me for making it sound so simple that way but he either is in control of everything or he isn't and that's where he's either God to the individual or he isn't because if we say that God isn't looking after us and and and the situation that's controlling our life right now is out of hand and God doesn't even know what's going on then we're actually potentially I would say this this is just my words I would say we're potentially slapping him in the face you know what I heard somebody coaching someone Once Upon a Time how to pray I may have told this story once but speaking about the face slapping someone had a new revelation a little bit of a new doctrine a little bit of a murmur we know that's the Antichrist Spirit as we studied when we looked at the seals it starts with just a discussion just a little murmur that's how the Antichrist works if you ever wonder about the Antichrist if you haven't studied it it starts with a murmur it starts with the discussion it starts with a little bit of a doctrine that actually Creeps in anyways this started to happen and and and a person was saying you know we just need to pray and open our minds and and just go into prayer and and pour out our hearts and in the end after we pour out all of our problems before God then we need to say to him don't you care can you imagine that saying that to almighty God who's been unveiled in our day but to say that it's got to be a slap in the face to our father because we're showing him that he doesn't know what's going on we're actually making him not God because if he's God he's omnipotent he knows everything there's nothing that he doesn't know he's everywhere but to be given the realization that the second coming of the Lord is the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age the seventh seal being open to us those people who have been given the ability to believe because there are people who have been given the ability to believe in Jesus day there was people who were given the ability to believe he went and chose them and it's interesting because as they went along there wasn't just the 12 people who believed we know that there was 120 people in the upper room there was more people along the way that potentially believed Jesus when they heard about him and we know it because we heard about the the blind people who actually cried out thou son of David have mercy on us who were they they weren't the ones that Jesus went to and called out by name and said come pick up your cross and follow me leave your father your mother your job your income leave everything behind they were just Beggars blind on the side of the road but they had a revelation there was people who were called from before the foundation of the world just like today to realize the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age and that only happened through the opening of the seals without that it would be the same as just about any other doctrine that we've heard of knowing that there are some really good works that happened but if them seals weren't open as brother Branham says all of those seals weren't open we wouldn't have the Mighty God unveiled before our eyes we know it wasn't brother Branham that opened them seals we've said it before when John was there in heaven when he went through that open door in in Revelations chapter 4 he realized that there was no man worthy to open the book but he began to weep he began to Weep For Joy because he realized there was one who was worthy to open the book when the Elder said to him weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah he hath prevailed and he alone is worthy to open the book in Matthew 13. Matthew chapter 13. verse 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest unto them in parables why do you speak to the people in parables why did he take a man from Kentucky and raise him up to be the prophet for this day I can tell you why because the way Jesus is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his program he runs exactly the same way that he's always done it he created a parable for our day take a little what's been said a hillbilly from Kentucky uneducated not scholarly had to be scolded on how to say the word pulpit had to be corrected in many different ways so many different things that he went through but he used him so that it would be a parable so that it would confound the wise because there was only a certain group of people given the ability to understand in in verse 10 of Matthew Chapter 13 and the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in Parables why why are you speaking that way and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it's not given it's no different today brothers and sisters than it was then exactly the same and I just think really in in and maybe forgive me if I sound like I just repeat this over and over again but isn't it just amazing when we can stand back and look at the whole picture and think out of the 7.8 billion people he chose us to be able to get this he gave us the ability to have eyes to see the message of the hour out of all the people in this world there's people that really desire to see this but they just don't like the way that it's wrapped they don't like the package that it came in they think that it should be scholarly they think that it should come a different way they think that it should have maybe a better education but brothers and sisters it's God's way he speaks to the world through parables he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath and you know we can look at this and apply it today brother Branham says that every scripture has a compound meaning and revelation we can take this scripture here and say that the people that have the people that have a curiosity sort of a a desire to see there's more to the gospel in our day God gives them the ability to see the message of the hour right how do we hear about the message of the hour something inside us is hungering and thirsting like the woman at the well but our life gets so clogged up with all of the stuff that we go through and then one day we meet someone that just speaks differently than everyone else that we've ever talked to in our entire lives all the people that we've ever met this one person says things in ways that we just never ever heard before and it just resounds with us something about it we just can't get away from whosoever hath to him shall be given those people that hath that desire to hear spirit and Truth to be able to hear hunger and thirst after righteousness have the desire to hear more for whosoever hath to him shall it be given but he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not those people who are just spiritually dead they have no faith inside of them at all their parents never knew the scripture if they train them up in the way they should go that it won't depart from them they were raised maybe in a way that was completely carnal no spiritual maybe they were creasters they went to church at Chris Christmas and and at Easter and that was the only thing maybe they believed in a hybrid religion and we know brother Bradham says a hybrid religion can never reproduce the only thing a hybrid religion will do is actually just bring death there's no life to go forwards in that but those people that hath not whosoever hath not from him shall it be taken away even that he hath in the world that we live in today the parallel to that would be those people that maybe did have a tiny little bit of religion in their lives maybe from a friend or a grandma a great grandma that that believed in something but the parents bought into a hybrid religion and got completely away from it those children that were raised they don't have it they just don't have that desire there's nothing in them to really go to church or to hear the word or anything about it and the word says here those people it will be taken away from them the desire will go you know what's really hit me recently that there's no way that we can come actually against the word that we can act in our lives against the word for our day and think that it's going to be okay we can't take the message of the hour and interpret it and say that I'm going to add one word to it or I'm going to take one word away from it I'm going to do you know what I want to do brother Bradham said this and the church that I went to when I was growing up did that and and it really scarred me and so now I'm just going to take and apply the word that I think that will apply and raise my children under that you know what it becomes at that point if we're adding or taking away to it it is actually a hybrid religion and a hybrid can't reproduce so sadly if that happens our children are not being raised in the way that they need to be raised so that it won't depart from them it's frightening it's frightening to think about for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath Jesus speaking here he says therefore speak I to them in parables because seeing they see not so now he's actually going to the the the carnal side explaining a spiritual matter seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive how many people in our lives do we come in contact with they just have no idea what we're talking about if we say that God sent a prophet they'll say Jesus check God check Church check worship check profit ooh ooh that's going a little too far somewhere along the way there's something that got in there to that teaching it's a little bit of a hybrid and when that happens it can't bring life and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive a prophecy speaking about a people for this people's heart is wax gross we live in a nation in a world of people whose Hearts have waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes you know it doesn't say their eyes are blind it says their eyes they have closed they've decided to just close their eyes to it I just don't even want to look at it I just want to look at something else people can't live their lives with their eyes closed so this to me says that he's speaking spiritually it's a very spiritual discussion using a carnal comparison for their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and here with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them can you imagine that people would want to actually avoid that but people don't realize it they're under the influence of another spirit that's why it's so it's just becoming clear and clearer to me brothers and sisters the whole thought of this that if we reject the Holy Spirit In Our Lives if we reject the opportunity that we've been given to get the Holy Spirit In Our Lives then we accept the mark of the beast and you know when we look at it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to think that there's a spiritual coming of Jesus Christ where he comes down with an open book in his hand puts one foot on the land one foot on the sea and actually declares that there should be time no more and actually opens the book opens the seals through his prophet in our day a spiritual coming of Christ you know what there is a spiritual sealing of Christ as well and that's receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives but there's also a spiritual ceiling of the Beast which is the exact opposite of that isn't there if we fail to get the mark the Seal of God in our lives the Holy Ghost the token the blood sacrifice if we fail to accept that in our lives then we accept the mark of the beast to reject the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast and you know there's going to be a physical mark of the Beast but fortunately the bride won't be here for that she'll be gone she'll be long in glory by that time where people can't buy or sell but it's interesting just to have the discussion to think about the spiritual connotation that's where we live today brothers and sisters we got free moral free morals we can do whatever we want to do you know the true bride she only wants to serve her husband she only wants to be with the one who actually gave her the ability to have eternal life she wants to minister to her husband but to reject the Holy Ghost in our day is to accept the mark of the beast it's amazing to look at it but he goes on to say but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear and I I just believe we could stop right there and say that blessed are your eyes for they see the things of God that song the things that were brought by the prophet in our day oh my blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them they've desired to see them but they haven't seen them they haven't been given the ability to see them because it wasn't for them it was for a very specific group of people you know knowing the scriptures have the compound meanings and Revelations to look at this whole scripture that we're reading here out of Matthew and to think about it he's talking about us right here we can put ourselves right there in that scripture many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see and they haven't seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have heard them how wonderful it is brothers and sisters to realize that this is the work of God and that if ye believe on him whom he hath sent out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water we're not here to labor for the meat which perisheth we're here to labor for the kingdom of God we're here to labor so that we can actually feed our souls we're going to probably talk about it a bit more tonight talking about the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world that light that John the Baptist spoke about that light that brother Bradham spoke about blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear you know what I'm just going to wrap up a little early this morning because we're going to have service tonight um maybe I'll just call the musicians what a tremendous thing it is to think that he has chosen a very specific way to express himself and the way that he's chosen to express himself brothers and sisters isn't through Ministry even though he does it isn't through musician even though he does he's chosen to express himself through the bride you know that that thought that Jesus doesn't come onto this Earth again until Revelations 19. only those people who actually have the ability to see this word to understand the spiritual connotation the spiritual reflection of what's being said in the carnal as we read the scripture here only those people are the ones that will actually meet with him in the clouds because he's not coming to Earth until Revelations 19 and at that time he comes with the whole bride and and it's going to be a totally amazing time when that happens but just to think that we have been given the ability to see that in our day to see that he's only called a very select few people and those people that have the ability to see that we've got reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters I know that the prophet has said it that we should be the happiest people on earth and I'm one I'd be the first one to say there's times where I have to ask the Lord to forgive me because I get caught up in the moment and and my problem seems to be greater than the promise but that's just the way the devil likes it for me to focus on my life to see that the the the problem is greater than the promise when it's actually a lie the promise is greater than any problem I could ever encounter on this side of Eternity there's nothing that's too great for the Lord there's no no nothing that's too far for him to reach his arms are not too short but just to have the understanding that blessed are our eyes for they see these things and our ears for they can hear these things How Great Is Our God maybe stand with me this morning for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear these things which ye hear and have not heard them [Music] it's absolutely wonderful to think that we can say that we're one of them let's just bow in prayer gracious Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your word so thankful Lord Jesus that you would take the time father to come and express yourself to us once again broken as it might have sound this morning father I pray that you would just take the words that were spoken and Lord just bless them to our spiritual nourishment father it
