TRANSCRIPT
========================================
pray Lord that you'd bless it that your people would be blessed Lord and um that through their natural Prosperity that they could bless other people in this world Lord we love you father we thank you for all your gifts and we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen okay so I'm going to start with what the young people know as my favorite scripture um so this is Matthew 6:30 to 34 I'll just quickly read it although I'm sure it's seared into many people's Minds by now wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day the evil thereof and I'll give my standard quick blur about this um I don't believe God is saying don't think about tomorrow my personal revelation on this is don't be consumed about the thoughts of tomorrow don't let your mind constantly be worrying about your future and one of the ways to do that is to set up your financial security because you know anybody who's had a bill due and who knows they don't have the money to cover that bill you know how awful that feels and what kind of anxiety twists at your stomach while you're waiting for that due date and it's it's a horrible feeling and you you you're not a worldly person because you're vexed about this problem it's real um so my My Hope Is that um with right principles in place any income level can find a way to manage um and plan for their future oh I guess I have a pointer now yay okay so uh just a couple more scriptures really quickly because I want to make sure we're starting on the right foot um God expects us to be stewards of His blessings so Matthew 25 ver14 to19 is the parable of the parable of the man who uh was giving the talents to the different servants and you know one invested them wisely and one best invested them two invested them wisely and one did not and the one was rebuked so my my thought is just make the most of what God has given you regardless of how small it may seem because God doesn't measure US based on the size of the talent we're given he measures US based on how we use what we are given and I think that's a really important key Luke 16:10 um is the scripture he that's faithful in that which is least is faithful also in in much and he that is unjust in least is also unjust in much so we are accountable to God with how we use what he gives us and I think that um it's going to be hard to answer with uh how how did you spend all these gifts and talents that I gave you if you cannot show that you gave anything back to the Lord so um I want to be mindful of that as well and Galatians 6 7 to8 is uh be ye not deceived God is Not mocked what a man Seth that shall he also reap so be intentional with your resources your money time wealth all of your gifts because as you s so um so so shall you reap that's kind of a tongue twister um so I I just want us to be especially the the young people as you're getting into your careers and into um you know even your high school time um you reap what you s so if you're if you're have a huge test or a deadline next week and you're not sewing any any investment of time into studying you might not reap uh a great reward and then your parents will be very ww okay last uh set of scriptures here so I want to I want to make sure that we understand that getting rich is not the goal um I don't think there's anything wrong with being rich just let me say that there's there was plenty of rich people in the Bible Solomon was the wealthiest man on earth I don't think God ever condemned Solomon for that um so there the but the point of this seminar is not to teach you how to get rich or how to get rich quick I don't believe in that personally I think getting rich takes uh many many years or the inheritance of one really wealthy ancestor um but the scripture says uh in Hebrews 135 that comparison is the thief of Joy uh when it says don't let your conversation be jealous be content with what you have for he said I will never leave you nor forsake you so don't be comparing yourself to somebody else who's a few years ahead of you or who has a different skill said or has a different gift monetary value is not what God's looking at in everything you know some people have the gift of preaching or speaking or music or Compassion or um uh even like cooking and serving Hospitality those are all wonderful gifts that have the world doesn't place a whole lot of monetary value on unfortunately and since as brother mban said our medium of exchange is currency we always tend to Value things by currency because that's the fastest way to measure but that's not what God looks at uh his currency is not in pled like ours and um he doesn't look at us that way Matthew 6:19 um lay not Treasures on Earth where moth corrupts and thieves steal lay up your Treasures in Heaven where your treasure is there will your heart be also so although I said it's it's fine to be rich I don't want people to think that you're you know having your heart on your riches is fine because it's being wealthy is one thing but measuring Yourself by that wealth is not uh is not healthy yes but the ber I just have to say what is Rich so I think that's a very flexible personal definition honestly and it depends on where you are probably how old you are and who you know because I would personally consider like for me I think I think of rich as somebody who doesn't have to consider their time for money they can they can volunteer they can do something for other people or they can be selfish and go sit on an island all day and whe no matter what they do they will be taken care of for the rest of their life to me that is like ultimate wealth where you have flexibility to do what you want but for some people rich is probably a million dollars and unfortunately that will not get you to what I just described uh anymore anyways not in Canada what do you think of as Rich I just think it's was mentioned mentioned it a couple times and there's a lot of different definitions you said that that's I'm certainly not here to correct but I just want maybe it's found upon the thought of which some people it could be simply to have a family and a healthy family right that goes to church and serves God that could be great riches but that's a very good point finances so I mean what what is Rich I guess right yeah for just for the stream I'll quickly summarize but Barry brought up a very good point I'm pretty single track at the moment thinking about about money uh but Barry's point I believe is Rich you can be you know there there's many Psalms about being rich in the Lord and rich in family and rich in health and Rich does not always have a monetary value so yeah absolutely like you know there's uh uh I every single day when I think about what I'm thankful for I I give thanks to God every day and money is never in the top three things that I'm thankful for the first thing is the safety of my family I think to live in a country where you have safety and health and we just take it for granted but I remind God every day of how thankful I am for that so very very good point um you can be rich in a whole lot of areas that have nothing to do with your bank account um Matthew 10:42 and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of the least of these my little ones uh sorry this is a different translation and whosoever shall give give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward so there's other Investments as well invest investing in your money only is not going to get you to the goal you need to invest in the people around you and in your community in your church Luke 6:38 give it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaken together and running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that ye meet with all it shall be measured to you again so again I think brother mvin touched on this a little bit today is just being generous with what God has blessed you with if God blessed you with the the gift of uh singing don't hold that to yourself and don't sell it to the world for um what they consider to be riches if God blesses you financially it doesn't mean that he wants you to just sit on an island somewhere uh God calls his children to use their blessings for other people people around them um especially in my opinion Believers but you know the scripture does not say to only bless bless Believers as well the um the the needy the hungry the widows all these people that are less fortunate okay so um these are I think the very very summarized Concepts that I want people to come away with so if you want to invest successfully number one start early H as soon as you can number two you need to be diverse in your Investments don't put all of your investments into one asset um number three is minimize taxes and fees in your investment plan otherwise you'll just constantly where moth where where uh where moth does corrupt and rust Decay that's taxes and fees mostly taxes uh be consistent in your plan don't be side Track by you know Bitcoin or um by whatever is trendy today or by market up ups and downs don't get caught up in the froth it's it's not very healthy and then finally adapt to your phase of life so somebody who's 13 versus 65 should have a very very different plan and a different strategy okay so when to start saving right now I don't care how old you are if you earn income uh the principle of saving is what I what I think is so important it's not how much money you're saving it's the principle and the Habit so a very uh unfortunate statistic these are recent statistics from uh Health the uh Health Care fund of Ontario it's like a giant pension fund come on in um 40% of Canadians these are adults uh did not save anything for their retirement last year 44% of Canadians that are less than 10 years from retirement do not have $5,000 saved 75% have less than $100,000 so these are really scary numbers unfortunately um and as you can see it's the vast majority the vast majority so if you're on your way to having over $5,000 by the time you're 55 consider yourself blessed because you're doing better than a lot of people in this country um I would I would like to start preparing our young people so that they have principles in place that there's another zero added on to that $100,000 by the time they're 55 or maybe 65 um inflation is a thing we'll talk about um so numbers uh when when I'm going to talk about future values today I'm going to be saying that there is no inflation I'm going to be pretending that there's no inflation just for the purpose of this discussion but I want to briefly educate you so you know having a million dollars in the bank used to be enough for future security about 15 years ago or so probably a million dollars would have set you up with a middleclass lifestyle forever because you could invest that and earn like three to 5% on that income on that on that asset and you could live on that 3 to five% uh like $3 to $50,000 for the rest of your life you cannot do that anymore unfortunately inflation over the last five or three years has averaged around 6% 5% something like that very very high for Canada anyways now we're back down to 2% which is the target for the Bank of Canada so 2% inflation is what they want forever um so you should understand that if you're saving you know $400 a month and you save that you think yes $400 $400 a month I'll make it to a million in like 40 years um you need to increase that $400 like every couple years because in in in in um 10 years that $400 is only going to buy you what $350 or so bought you 10 years ago so inflation can be a little bit weedy I don't want to get really really technical but just understand that you need to gradually add to your Investments over time that is complicated to math and I want to hurt our heads and I don't have the brain for that brother Chris is my math guy and he's not here so um for the purpose of this presentation we're going to use constant values so we're going to say that $500 today is worth the same amount in 60 years or 100 years so all the numbers that I'm working with I'm trying to keep them constant as if no inflation happened what that really means though is you're going to have to invest more over time to to make it to that level okay um so annual rate of of Return of 7% and for this for this example only I am going to show you because I want to I want to shock a few people and and encourage others at how much you would need to save to get a million dollars after inflation I should have said what I just said after this slide um so for this calculation this is assuming 2% inflation and that your money is going to return 7% every single year that's not that's not super hard to do honestly 7% uh over the course of 20 years or something is uh is not unreasonable um so if you start saving at the age of 18 you will have a million dollars by the time you're 65 if you put $620 a month so how many 18y olds have 620 bucks a month in their jeans that's I think that's quite a lot of money honestly um but keep in mind this is after inflation um so this means that you will have a million in real buying power by the time you're 65 uh if you uh if you took out inflation this would be closer to like uh$ 300 and something dollars but uh 18 to 65 is so long you have a long time to battle inflation but you also have a long time to let your money grow going to the other edge of the spectrum I'm sure you guys can read these numbers yourselves I don't have to read them all out to you but on the other side you know 620 a month if you're 18 turns into 2100 a month if you're 40 trying to reach the same goal of getting a million dollar after inflation by the time you're 65 so this is called compounding compounding interest it means that if you put $100 in the bank today and you don't touch it in maybe a year it'll be worth $107 but the next year that seven that 7% um interest is going to apply on $107 not $100 so the next year you you're not going to earn $7 of Interest you're going to earn $725 or something if you add zeros behind those numbers that becomes really important the compounding power of of uh interest and Investments as your assets grow they grow faster and that's why if you see return graphs they will often Bend and get much steeper at the end of life because the longer you wait before taking those out those last five to 10 years are your highest earning years the interest alone can be worth more than you've invested for the first 10 years all cumulatively so um really important Concepts here so how do you start saving um going back to our first seminar does this can you see this pointer on the screen I I don't think it works on the screen um okay so budget for it if you don't well if you fail to plan you plan to fail old ad AG very true uh the first seminar that we did um I don't know if you guys remember does anybody want us to take a stab at where but where investing was in your budget plan as far as like you have your income what comes off next tithes what came off next savings savings so after you've paid your tithes you need to pay your future self and if you if you do that your future self will patch you on the back and be very very grateful be nice to your future so budget for it if if you don't budget to invest um what's going to happen is you'll probably end up spending most of your money and then you won't have anything left to invest so that's why I think it's critical to put that in your plan is that you know this 10% or whatever is going to go into my investment and then you can find out how much you can afford to spend on a house automatic transfers absolutely key if I had to manually transfer money into my savings account whenever I had enough left over I'm sure I would never do it maybe like Christmas I would think about it oh yeah I haven't done anything this year and I would like throw a couple hundred in Christmas and then not realize it was supposed to be a couple hundred a month for like the last three years so uh I think automatic transfers are really really powerful yes we all know what automatic transfers is can you just expound because that's been our number one principle so we we never see our never see our paycheck piece of investment it comes out automatically we never see it can we just expound on that a little bit I think that's so so important so I I hope I'm getting at what you're talking about here but like if if you get paid on the first of the month that's probably when you should have your Investments coming out and that that's the way we do it um I'm self-employed so I don't want to really use me as an example because it's not very common but um you know most people you get paid maybe twice a month or something like that on those days you should probably have some fixed trans transfers that come out automatically that you can't control after that point um we also send our investments to a different institution they're not at our our primary bank because I don't want to touch them and I don't want to be tempted to touch them sometimes we just forget about it because the money automatically comes out we we have to live on what's left in the bank account and so it since it's automatic there's no risk or temptation to say oh the car broke down I can't invest this month I'm going to wait till the next month and then the fridge breaks down and then you go for dinner too many times so it's a it's a much safer strategy to just start with an automatic withdrawal you can do this um through your bank itself I might briefly touch on the literal practical steps you take but I don't want to get too far down that road because it could be different for everybody but this is as easy as going to your bank and saying I want to put $500 a month into an investment and they can help you I don't think the bank is the best place to help you but it's the easiest place and if you do nothing else if you from this whole seminar and you and you have not started investing then just go to your bank and start it immediately because uh I don't want you to take the best option but wait years to do it it's better to start today you can always change your Investments you can always take that money out and put it somewhere else once you get more um you know perspective of of your plan does that answer your question employee savings and investment matching this is by far the best one if you have an employer matched pension fund or uh RSP matching something like that they're they're called many different names um crystals I think they they match 5% of her salary so if she invests 5% of her paycheck they will brother sister Helen probably knows better than I do on this because I okay but I forget what the union did right now but it's I think it's 5% they you invest 5% so say you make this is this is not the real number but it's easy say you make $100,000 in a year you invest $5,000 your employer matches another $55,000 what's your return on investment in your first year 100% return on your investment in your first year and compounding interest applies after that so we're going to show you an example uh of how strong that concept is if you are not taking advantage full advantage of your employer matched Savings Plan please stop your other investing immediately if you if you're if you're throwing money into Bitcoin or into a savings account Whittle that down till you're matching till you're fully utilizing your employer matched savings plan because they will give you can invest it in anything you want you don't have to invest it into your employer stock they often want you to but most of the time uh I shouldn't say all the time but most of the time they will allow you to invest in anything um and they'll match it so it's it's extremely valuable windfalls so you know um sometimes you'll get a bonus like a Christmas bonus or maybe you'll do an extra job on the side so your salary is say 65,000 a year I'm using 65,000 by the way because that's what we last seminar we said the average income in C in Calgary the average single earner is 65,000 so that's what I'm going to use for all these examples as well if you make another you know thousand a month tithe on it and then invest on it as well don't let it just go and into ice cream or something like that try to try to use that that windfall to accelerate your investing and your saving your future self will thank you um start now same as kind of previous slide start and end start now start now whatever if if you are not a on a salary job if you're like a student and you're just making a little bit of money I don't care get used to putting 10% away for our kids we force them it's not a democracy in our home uh they put away 10% of their income and uh it's growing in a little account and I don't know if I want all Li to hear this but I think by the time they turn 18 they'll be able to buy a car like almost anything they they want uh on wheels at that age because we are forcing them to save now and that money is slowly growing and by the time you know 16 years after they start maybe 14 years years we started them about four years old um they'll probably have enough money and they're putting aside a little bit of their own money too so it's just getting used to not spending everything you make and and you just get used to this concept like okay I made $10 this week but I'm not going to get to spend $10 this week There's tithes and investing that come first and then I can spend whatever's left over okay this is the difference of using your employer matched investing plan versus not the Blue Line both of these people are investing the exact same amount of money in the exact same asset for the exact same amount of time the only difference is the guy in the red you utilized his saving his investor or sorry his employer match savings plan so the N number here this is after 40 Years of investing 10% of a $65,000 income so 10% of $65,000 after tax by the way yeah because I I think it's it is actually pretty hard to save 10% of your pre-tax income that's quite aggressive unless you're making good money anyways that is $416 a month they're saving after 40 years this person uh made the the blue I think made 1.2 million in 40 years from only investing $416 a month the red is 2.5 million and the only difference is that they you they have an employer ma match Savings Plan it's 100% return guys do not let that go if you if you're working somewhere ask them if you don't know ask them hey do we have any benefits like match saving plan sometimes they don't match 100% when I was at demo they only match 50% but 50% return on your investment on day one it's an absolute bargain so do not let that go um to see if I had any notes on this one okay so the next was diversification uh does anybody know does anybody want to take a stab at what what it means to be diverse in your Investments but Peter just saying that don't put your egg in one basket yes so but Peter says don't put your eggs in one bask all your eggs in one basket so if you have a really good stock that you understand and it's and it's powerful like um I'm going to use the example of like uh Apple because most people know who apple is and they've done quite well over the last 10 years so if you had only invested in apple 10 years ago you'd be very happy today because they have beat the market they've done extremely well on average they've they've made you a lot of money do you know who else was making way more than Apple you guys won't remember this Enron in the turn of the century in the in the mid to late 90s Enron was printing money and uh almost literally they um so if you owned Enron stock from like 1992 to 2000 you were so so happy in like May of 2000 that stock went to zero because the the company went bankrupt it didn't go it didn't go like this and slowly waved down it went like this and then it went bam and everybody was caught on the ride and lost their shirt uh 2008 the banking crisis Leman Brothers bankrupt in a matter of like five days nobody thought that would happen I'm not saying Apple's going bankrupt uh but I'm saying that putting all of your your investments into one good asset is a very very very risky thing to do um maybe it doesn't go to zero maybe you're five years from retirement and then it just loses 30% of its value and now how do you make up 30% in 5 years you're going to be very stressed so um I believe in in picking stocks if you know what you're doing I don't I certainly don't uh so what I think is a safer plan is to diversify and have a basket of multiple different stocks so when I say diversification this is not like you know having apple and Microsoft they're in the same industry it's not even having Apple Microsoft Google Nvidia Facebook all those cool stocks they're all following the same trend line and if one goes down they're all going to go down because it's going to be a big reason that pulls them down maybe government regulation changes maybe electricity goes to 300 bucks a kilowatt hour or something um so maybe the robots come who knows but basically if you're going to diversify you need to have many Industries so I have a few points here a diversified investment is many Industries many risk profiles so some assets are like Nvidia much more like this you know risky it's going up and down but it's climbing fast growth growth stock then there's stuff like uh Royal Bank of Canada it's kind of been going like this slow and steady for 50 years so it's not growing a ton but it's also quite safe way less risk you don't necessarily want all your eggs in that basket either because then somebody else is going to outpace you and make a lot more than you in the same amount of time so you want both um many geographical locations this is not as applicable if you're only investing in the United States because the United States is the cap is the capital king of the world um but if you're only investing in Canada I personally don't believe that that's a good idea because Canada's Market is growing much slower than the the states um also there's overseas markets there's um Asian markets sometimes they're growing much faster than ours are as well so what I'm trying to say is like a mix of everything will mean that when the market crashes you're less likely to to lose everything and when the market explodes you know you're going to rise a little bit as well um many asset allocations this one's a bit technical but it it's not applicable too much in your early career it's much much more when you're closer to retirement that means like stocks uh is is an asset type then there's bonds bonds is like debt that a company lends you or that sorry that you lend a company much safer but slower growing um then there are like T bills those are government treasuries those are very safe they grow very very slowly though and then there's cash which is very very safe but grows at like 1% so savings accounts basically oh by the way I didn't show this I didn't make a graph for this but I wanted to quickly mention if you are um saving money but you're only putting it into a savings account you're not investing it in the market you're also going to be you're going to be further behind than that blue line that blue line is 7% return if if you only put it in a savings account in the same period of time you'd end up with like around 400,000 so 60% less than the person who invested in the market so sometimes the stock market is scary but it doesn't mean that it's actually dangerous it's just stock picking is dangerous if you pick one good stock that's that or you get a tip from a friend um that's what's really Danger dangerous because you could lose everything but if you're doing what I'm going to talk about um you're not going to lose uh you're not going to lose everything in the stock market unless you know the world comes to an end and then we're happy because that's actually what we all want okay um so the easiest way to diversify is by buying into a large pool of assets I'm sure you've heard of mutual funds that's what a mutual fund is it's a fund that's mutually held by many investors so maybe you have $1,000 maybe Bill Gates has a billion dollars you both invest in the same fund and you are getting uh your cut of the whole fund so if you you know if if your money makes up 1% of the fund you make 1% of the return the fund is not invested in one stock they're invested in whatever you choose you know um there's like there there's different categories and this is what I don't want to get too technical in but if you feel really good about oil and gas there are oil and gas Mutual funds that will hold many different oil and gas industry um uh players you know from from Upstream to uh service and all those different types of elements and that's safer than just buying one stock but you're still going to be exposed to the to the oil and gas market overall or you can buy a diverse group from everything and that's going to be a little bit safer um but mutual funds are actively managed there's there's some guy in the Ivory Tower making way too much money deciding every single day how much to buy and sell for that mutual fund so if if you as an investor you say hey um buddy I want you know 10% return on my investment he's like ah we're only at 6% this year we've done a bad year so I I better buy and sell stuff to make more money and then he does the wrong thing so there's no guaranteed that a mutual fund will make more just because it's managed by a smart person but it is guaranteed that you'll pay more in fees uh I'll show that soon exchange traded funds these are very similar but a completely different method instead of a smart guy making decisions or girl making decisions every day about what to buy and sell they set a rule so of of the most popular rule that most people are buying into is um it's just called like the SNP 500 Index an index fund so an ETF exchange trated fund the rule will be what whoever is in the S&P 500 which is the 500 biggest companies in the in the US Stock Market we are going to buy one of each show those shares and you know if somebody else puts a million dollars in we're going to buy that value of each of those shares that's their rule they don't make a decision if the market crashes or if the you know if um oil is found in Antarctica they don't they don't make any decisions based on that all they do is follow the rule so as an investor you have to kind of make a decision do I like their rules or do I want a smart guy making all the decisions the big difference between these two is fees and that's the rust decaying your uh returns in my my personal uh opinion there are great mutual funds but um I'm going to show you why they might not be the best uh Bank your buck minimize taxes this one is uh I think most people understand probably over 18 I don't think a lot of the young guys do so I I wanted to kind of go through this um R RSP is registered retirement Savings Plan it's a government of Canada program other countries have it but they're called different things so the way this works is just as it says your contributions to an RSP give you a tax refund so say you're making $65,000 in our example um your tax rate is 30.5% in Alberta if that's your income that's your federal and provincial tax combined so um every th000 that you invest into an RSP the government is going to say that is $1,000 less we're going to tax you on it's the government's way of incentivizing the public to invest um so say you made $65,000 you invest $1,000 you're going to get $35 um as a as a refund from your tax or return reduction technically in your tax bill so um bu math here was um you know investing 10% of 50,000 a year that'll come into I think the next example give me a quick sec to read what I wrote here yeah yeah yeah okay so um every thousand you invest simple math not not getting very tax rates change every five or $6,000 don't don't think about that just pretend it's always 30.5% every th000 you contribute to your RSP is going to reduce your taxes this is huge if you're really smart with that return so you know you can take that, or that $35 and buy a new pair of shoes but that that is money that you had already spent you'd already been taxed on you'd already let it go out the door pretend that that money is no longer yours and when you get that tax refund put it back into your RSP you're going to make much much more over the long run so maximize your returns by reinvesting your refund if you get a refund in this example investing 10% of your $50,000 net income is $5,000 a year so you're investing 10% per year into your RSP you're going to get a refund of $1,525 at the end of the year when you do your taxes and um if you put that $1,525 back into your RSP plus your $5,000 that you're investing every year anyways your next year you're investing $6,595 guess what that's higher than 5,000 and guess what that's less taxes you're going to pay your next year's refund is$ 1,990 so if you add that to your $5,000 that's 6,900 you're investing do this over and over and over and it creates The Snowball Effect where this can just take off and this is if you think about it this way this is free return free money because if you think about that refund is just gone already you've committed it to uh to Trudeau then uh um when it gets when it comes back to you if you reinvest it it just it just takes off so these are the first two examples the yellow is the remember the previous Slide the person who invested 46 46 a month that's 5,000 a year um but they did not get employer matching that's the yellow line the red line is the smarter person who got employer matching and they're way up here the Blue Line did both of those things and then took their refund from both and put it back into the RSB p and they're at I forget the exact number it looks like 3.3 million over over the course of 40 years they made over a million dollars more than the other guy did um whoops so huge prompts to brother Chris he did the actuaries on this I couldn't figure out the formulas so uh he put this together and um I think it's amazing to think about if you if you are only investing your own money this is the difference uh that's possible I unfortunately do not get this option my employer doesn't match my rsps but yes brother mvin yeah I mean once you're done with that maybe the previous slide I just have clarification maybe yeah in what you mentioned but 100% of turns are taxable but if if they inside the rrsp account then they're not taable until you put them out very very good point okay so what he's saying at the top I said your contributions to an RSP give you a tax refund that's what we've just been talking about but 100% of the returns are taxable those are not the returns you make every year those are the returns when you cash out so say say for simple math you invested $100,000 and then in 10 years it turned into $200,000 if you take that $200,000 out you get taxed on $200,000 so the government gives you a refund when you invest but they kind of make their money back when you pull it out the concept here I'll get into later as to why this is still probably a good thing for some people um and that's all about the timing and how much money you're making or how much tax you're paying now versus in retirement any any questions this is a relatively subtle like not a lot of people do this I feel does it make sense though like does anybody have a question they want to ask ask about this okay so the other way is um there there's two really popular registered savings plans in in Canada one is your RSP which we just talked about there's a complete opposite which is called your tfsa taxfree savings account so at this if you invest you don't get any refund today you don't get any tax benefit today so what that means essentially is you're investing after tax money so if you made like I showed before you make 655,000 a year your after tax money is only 50,000 so the the negative thing about tfsas is you don't get a refund to maximize your investing like like an example that we just showed the positive thing is if you believe that your tax that your Investments are going to grow and do really well over time maybe you're going to stay in in it for a very long time like you start investing when you're very young and you're going to let this thing ride till you're 65 or 85 you don't get taxed on a scent of your returns so in the other example I said for simple math you invest $100,000 turns into $2 200,000 you get taxed on $200,000 when you pull it out of your RSP hopefully you don't do that all at once this is just for an example sake that would be very very bad decision unless you had much more money elsewhere um with taxfree savings account if if your 100,000 grows to 200,000 you don't get taxed on any of the returns so you could pull out you this could your 100,000 could turn into a trillion dollars probably wouldn't but it could and you wouldn't get taxed on any of the returns so if you have this might be a little bit too personal and I'm not saying this is advice I'm just saying this is like a strategy if you if you have play money like money that you are taking a little bit of a risk on it's not your 10% this is like your extra slush money that you want to just play on the stock market maybe you want to put $1,000 into Tesla for some reason if you do it in a tfsa and it go it goes to the moon uh that's probably going to be a really good tax day because um those those highrisk assets that go up really quickly if you time it right and sell at the right moment you know you could uh you could walk away with a lot of cash and not pay any taxes on it that's not a strategy for long term growth though that's like uh I'm just talking about playing around the other thing that tfsas are great for is medium to short-term savings um this is I did this uh early in the the last four years or whatever I've been putting a little bit of money into a tfsa for a car and this summer I just pulled the money out of the tfsa when I found a car I liked and I I bought the car and I didn't pay any taxes on any of my returns so it's nice for short to medium-term investing because you don't want to do that to your RSP because you're going to trigger a tax and um that's going to minimize how much you get back and your long-term investing you shouldn't be touching ever until your in your retirement years but tfsas can also be excellent for long term they're they kind of cover all the bases because like I said if this is going to grow for 45 50 years that tax saving is massive um so I kind of recommend both um in parallel the the big brain strategy here is if you think you're going to make more money now while you're investing like if your tax if you think your tax ratees going to be higher today than it is when you retire you should probably put more money into your RSP because you're going to be getting a bigger tax advantage today if you think you're going to be making way more money in retirement like you're young and you think your income is just going to grow grow grow grow and by the time you retire you're going to be in the top bracket or something then a tfsa might be the better idea because your tax advantage is much bigger when you're in the higher tax bracket for tfsa sorry if you're taking it out in your higher tax bracket does that this one's pretty technical I'm open to questions does anybody have any clarifications or questions about this just seeing some semi-glazed looks um again I'm just trying to trigger your memories this is the kind of stuff there's pretty clear information online about how these pro programs work and every major bank will offer you this you can get tfsas and rsps at any Bank um also all the investing apps like wealth simple or Robinhood you can get registered accounts and all of those so this is not hard to do it's just as hard as opening a bank account opening an RSP so don't let that ever scare you away from investing you might have it in your slide the the first Home Savings Account It's a combination of DF I don't have that no no I don't actually understand that one very well it started last year 8,000 per year for those who wanted to buy their first home it will be like a tfsa but when you withdraw you don't need to return it to tfsa uh to your RSP then you not tax that all so you get the you get the RSP style benefit when you invest yes but you don't have to reinvest it when you take it out you don't need to pay taxes on it when you take it out it's a combination you get both yes you have both the the benefit of tfsa I'm sorry I didn't I didn't look into this one because uh I'm I'm a little bit um out of touch with that so I I'll have to do some research on this what's it called first Home Savings Account fhsa FHS okay so look up the fhsa if you have not bought a home yet if you're planning to buy one these guys yeah no these guys are all sitting on they got property in Dubai so what brother brother mvin is saying I have not read this yet so um do your own research but he's saying that like if you invest you get the tax benefit today of an RSP where you get a deduction on your taxes but when you take the money out to buy your first home you also don't get taxed on the returns that sounds like a win-win win to me if you're saving up for a home you should probably be doing that and the limit is 8,000 8,000 a year is what you can put in start in 2023 otherwise before if you have an RP and you want to withraw it you pay at$ mhm and then you have to re you have to reinvest it as well a def tax no what I'm saying is that before this before this it's a def tax tax yet but you pay the tax when you are not 55 65 years okay if you withdraw the money before 65 now the bank we need you need to pay that tax ta that you did not pay and then you P penalty but now the government came and said that you don't have as far as you have an N you can go and take this money without going through this I think yeah I I think there might be a bit of differences here between like pensions RSP and then this fhsa I think we might have touched on all three of those right now but um for Simplicity I'm more so talking about your investment for retirement I don't have anything in here for buying your first home um but that is definitely something that obviously you need to save up for if you want to be getting one and that sounds like an amazing plan so I would definitely take advantage of the fhsa um okay I think I got all of that so after minimizing taxes then you want to think about minimizing fees this one is kind of a personal take so don't don't trust me as being like the expert because I'm not a financial planner um however this is something that I feel pretty pretty strong about um but it's just an opinion it's not um uh there there's not an absolute right or wrong to this direction it's more so your beliefs will direct how you invest in this so I mentioned mutual funds you can technically have a mutual fund and a and a t um an ETF that have very very similar plans and goals and aspirations but the way they're managed is the big difference so an RS or sorry a mutual fund is actively managed there's a bunch of nerds in an office somewhere calculating and finding the best assets and calling up Buy byy Buy sell sell so that's th that's those guys and because there's so many Nerds they they cost a lot of money their salaries are massive and uh they also get massive bonuses whenever you make money they make money so that's supposed to incentivize them to do the right thing right but they still make a lot more than you do so uh oh and also if they lose all your money they still make money which seems a little bit weird but anyways uh the active management side is very expensive so um on a on an investment a standard mutual fund 1.5 to 2.8% is is a pretty big spread Canada has some of the highest mutual fund fees in the industry in the world ours are averaging closer to 2.2% um if you work with a bank like RBC bimo that kind of stuff they're very very high and I'll show you in a graph soon you know I like graphs um how much this is going to erode your returns over time so if you think about a an asset manager you know targeting a 10% rate of return if he's charging you 2.8% how much do you get after it's all said and done you're getting like 7.2% so he is taking off the top from from everything that you make so you know some some asset managers are brilliant and they actually do make more money than the market but it's exceptionally rare only 12% this is from a study by the uh S&P or sorry the Dow Jones um Industrial Average they do like a survey of mutual funds twice a year and they found that 12% of actively managed funds were actually able to make more than the stock index which means you just put your money in this blind ETF and did nothing and nobody made any decisions the market went like this the mutual fund went like this and ended up lower than excuse me ended up lower than um than the market so you paid these nerds and they actually lost you money 88% of the time that's what happened 88% of the time they lost money not not lost money they they did not beat the market so what's the point um that's kind of My Philosophy again this is a personal take obviously this is a multi-trillion dollar market so there's a lot of people that believe in it um just my buddy Warren Buffett kind of agrees with me so um when you're looking at a mutual fund if you're thinking about investing in a mutual fund I just advise you to ask your um your investment manager whoever is giving you this advice what is the return before and after the fee it's called an me management expense ratio and um they might not want to tell you or if they're good they'll just be like oh yeah this is it and I've been showing you the after fee return this whole time and sometimes that's the case and that's great the other thing to consider though is how long has this Mark this fund been beating the market for they'll they'll say oh from you know 2020 when the market crashed till now these guys have been beating the market that's actually not super hard to do if you looked at what the what the Fed was doing pumping trillions of dollars into the industries and printing money and lowering interest rates I could have made a ton of money if I had somebody else's bucket load of cash to do it with so look at the timing it must be 10 years at least if they have not been beating the market over a 10-year average don't believe that they're going to beat the market tomorrow um because there's not enough time for a full cycle to go through in less than 10 years you know there's all those booms and busts that's uh you want to capture all that exchange traded funds the fees that these charge are 100 times lower 0.02% to 0.5% so that's a pretty huge spread but the ones that I'm investing in they're 0.03% like extremely small and and yes they're technically coming off your return but they're so much smaller um uh as long as you believe in the plan that the ETF is setting out so these funds like I said before they just set rules they don't have people managing every day they just set a rule if this then that and there's no decision and that way it can be automated they have a lot of machines and programs doing this and not a lot of humans so it's much much cheaper but good or bad no matter what the market does they stick to their Rule and that's it so that's why that's why they're cheaper so this again thank you Chris this is a simulation that he built showing if you put $110,000 I believe this is over oh I don't I don't have the time Horizon here I think this might have been 25 years or something but uh if you put $10,000 in at the beginning and the market on average returned 7% over this time and the mutual fund returned 8 .5% so in this scenario which only 12% of the time is true the mutual fund beat the market by one and a half percent very good job the Nerds earned their pay um but after the mutual fund fees W you're here so these guys made more money the fund overall returned a higher return in the market but the managers took most not most but took a lot of your returns and because of the rule of compounding interest that I talked to you guys about you know as your investment grows you get more growth on the growth and then you get growth on the growth on the growth kind of like uh no I won't say um but they're uh yeah it's like gaining weight um so over here you can see right away when this starts to pull away the Blue Line starts to pull away from the orange it's basically over already because now every year they're working with more money and more money and more money and that just compounds over the course of 20 years and this is why I feel so strongly about ETFs um and so I just urge you if you're only invested in mutual funds just at least read into it don't take my word for it do some do a little bit of reading about what an ETF is if you I don't want to give any any individual names but the most popular things that people invest in here are just index funds so if you've ever heard about the TSX that's the Canada's like largest hund companies is it I think something like that the SNP 500 is the United States largest 500 companies the Dow Jones Industrial Average that's like um it's a certain segment of I think a 100 companies and there's the uh NASDAQ that's high-tech more tech tech Focus companies so basically those indexes have already done all the work for you they have put together a list of the top blah companies for blah reason insert name here and you can just for 0.03% fee you can just put all your money into you know the ETFs that you believe in and they're Diversified if you're if you're buying into an index fund they're somewhat Diversified because like the S&P 500 is 500 of the largest companies in the United States um they're Diversified they are low fee and then you can use these in your tfsa or your RSP or probably your fhsa so they're quite flexible and if you're just you know picking individual stocks or you're only buying mutual funds or you're only using a savings account you could be leaving quite a bit of return on the table over the course of you know 20 years or whatever yes um so when you're investing do you want to look for a a fund that has pay dividends so she asked if you're investing do you want to look for a fund that pays dividends and I would say it depends on your stage of life where you are I as a you know what I'm still like relatively early in my process I would say I'm not too worried about dividends myself I'm more interested in growth so if I can get a fund that gives me you know a 5% dividend or a fund that gives me 7% growth I would rather take the growth because I don't need income at this stage however if you're anywhere like if you're within like 10 years of retirement I think dividends become more important than growth because you're going to get a fixed income off of these most companies will not reduce their dividends it's a Death Note to their value if they reduce dividends so they always want to maintain or grow dividends over time and you can live off those dividends um a a dividend is basically at the end of a quarter or or a year the companies who do declare dividends they're like Banks a lot of these lower growth but more stable um value stocks I think is what they're called they they can declare a dividend um and that dividend goes straight to shareholders so if you own 500 shares and they declare a five like a two cent dividend you get a th000 cents but you know uh over hundreds and thousands of of shares um that some somebody might own that can be your entire income so you can retire on only dividend income you get taxed differently as well there's different taxes for divid income which I don't understand well enough to talk about but um does that kind of answer your question I think it depends a little bit on what age you are or how far from retirement you are I do believe though everybody should have a little bit of everything at the end of the day you should have a mix um that's what diversification is all about if you only have growth stocks um and the market collapses you collapse with it so having a little bit of more stable dividend uh fixed income can definitely Shield you from that okay I think I'm done with all my pretty graphs uh just a couple more slides here so the next uh point was consistency so consistent monthly contributions we talked about making an automatic transfer from your account so personally um you know we have we have different Investments going to different things they're all automatic um but in the last two years or so I set up a wealth simple account and I love it honestly it's so easy to use um there's there's many other apps out there uh like Quest trade there's I don't know if Robin Hood is good for Canada or not but no um and there's another big one in Canada I can't remember the name of I sorry I that might be it ibkr anyways if you look if basically if you're in Canada and you're you're using an app like you need to have a you want to have a Canadian um not a Chartered Bank uh but you want to have it being a Canadian institution because in Canada we have Deposit Insurance for you know $250,000 of your bank balance is insured by the government so if you're downloading an app that is international a you're probably going to have to fund it with US dollars or a different currency and then B you don't lo you don't get the deposit protection insurance but anyways for well simple I don't use it for banking at all I have an automatic transfer coming out into certain ETFs there and what what I personally love about it is it's so easy to just like pull up my phone any time of day and I can just pop and see what oh the market went up what's my investment doing okay I can see it that's pretty cool but for some people that can be a negative because if you have access to it you might be attempted to Tinker and be consistent don't panic when the market crashes don't sell in a crash if you are you know five plus years from retirement please do not react to a market crash it's a good thing for you if you're not selling so think about it if you're doing um the next uh the next bullet point here it's called dollar cost averaging I'll kind of give you a scenario to explain it if you're investing like in our example $416 a month and the market crashes and you're still investing $416 a month what do you think is happening to your investment say you're buying shares that cost $100 a share and then the market crashes to $50 a share you're buying twice as many shares and if you're not selling in the next few years who cares keep buying at that lower rate you're literally getting a sale and so don't sell in the middle of a crash Market um it's not uh you know it's it's generally nearly impossible to time the market that's what the Nerds are trying to do and 88% of the time the very very well-paid very very well educated people cannot do it so I don't think I have a chance maybe you have an anointing or you you have an inside loop or something and and like that's I think I think if you understand an industry very very well like brother mvin knows a lot about oil and gas he's probably one of the very few people that could actually predict and time things in his industry because if you have a super solid connection with the value of your industry you can probably do a lot better than most other people can in that same industry for me though I don't understand any industry well enough to make stock picks so I just go into the index and when the index crashes I just keep buying because I'm not selling so I don't really uh I'm not worried about it at all and when it goes up I'm not really selling either uh some some people buy more in a hot market and I understand the emotional aspect of that because like oh it's going up I want to get in but if you're not selling you're now paying a premium and you don't know if that Market's going to slide down tomorrow like if you look at the last five years uh speaking of which this is from 2014 to 2023 look at all these crashes and valleys and mountains there are a million reasons to sell here's 31 of them so US Stocks flat for 20 months that happened here look what happened right after that so if you would have sold because you were depressed about the flat Market you would have lost all this return or what about if you bought at the top of this peak because oh the Market's hot it's going up I better buy in and then it goes down it's better generally safe to just have a budget for how much you're going to invest and just stick to your plan unless you're investing into a specific niche market that could go away forever like if you're if you're really into Ai and then the world finds out oh shoot AI is not actually worth what we thought it was that's the only time you might actually be a bit uncomfortable with Market crashes because you could lose everything uh like if you're in Enron in the turn of the century that was a bad day um but look at this uh uh UK Russian Ukraine war happened here and look how much like everybody thought this is going to this is going to drag down the market Commodities are going to are going to go through the roof energy is going to be unaffordable for everybody my utilities now are cheaper than they've ever been and uh obviously I don't live in Europe so I'm much more shielded than they are but the point is there's bad news almost every single day and this is only a 10year cycle um so believe that if you invest for 10 years you're going to see your money go down many many times just don't panic stick to your plan and see it through going back for one second I like this idea um making a game out of investing so if you have a hard time putting money away consistently I think it could be an interesting concept especially maybe if you have children to incentivize them like you know once you maybe set a quarterly or an annual goal or something like that and you say hey if you invest or if I if you're talking to yourself if you make all the rules yourself if I invest 200 bucks a month for three months in a row I get to go buy a new pair of shoes or I get to add $50 a month to my my eating out budget this month and you can you can like you know if you've got the cash you can afford it because you've been so good to your future um so I I really like this idea if somebody's having a hard time just getting started um I think this could be a good way to just kind of give yourself a little bit of a kick in the pants and make it fun this is um maybe a bit controversial but this is something that Mom and Dad's financial planner told me a long long time ago and it just is kind of trying to tap into human nature and your own personal psyche and uh he actually said if you're having a hard time investing um borrow borrow a little bit of money to pay for something other than investing and then invest the money you were going to use for that so don't leverage your investing because that's risky and very dangerous but uh for example we had um you know like things things coming up we had a line of credit and we were trying to decide if we could afford to buy like I think a certain amount of life insurance for me and maybe some Investments because had a car that was kind of on the fritz so instead of I I was thinking I can't really afford to commit to investing because I don't want to start and stop once I start I never want to stop I just want to leave that money and keep it going in there every month but I didn't want to because of my car so he said well um you sound like the kind of person who doesn't let debt get out of control and if this is you this might be applicable if not stay away uh but I am that way if I see debt I'm just crushing it as soon as as I can I'm I'm pulling out you know personal spending I'm pulling out entertainment I'm pulling out a lot of like travel everything I'm going to cut my cost until I get rid of that debt and um so what we did was I ended up committing to this investment and then when the car needed a fix I used my line of credit for like the $300 part or whatever it was and I crushed that like within a couple months I got rid of it but it allowed me to kind of get into this habit and um you know over time we got a little bit of emergency account and you know how it is like unexpected stuff comes up and instead of robbing my investment account you know instead of stopping my investment when covid happened this happened to me I lost about 80% of my income in one week and it and it was gone for like six seven months it was extremely dire and so we stopped everything we stopped our mortgage payment we stopped our utilities payment we called our phone company we called everybody we owed money to and they allowed us to stop payments indefinitely until I had work again and um the one thing we didn't stop was investing and that was just because of the principle of how hard it is to restart an optional payment if it's optional You'll Always Find a reason to option out because you know you want to have something else or something else goes wrong but I knew I had to pay my phone bill eventually I knew my mortgage was going to need to be paid and that's why we paused those things we definitely could have paused our investments that we're fully within our rights to but I pulled strings to make my debt pause and I paid interest on them I had to keep paying interest on those those those debts but um I think the principle was force yourself find a way if you know yourself if you know what makes you tick find a way to manipulate your your mindset to get into investing in a consistent basis and just don't let it stop if something comes up try to find something else to cut obviously if you're in a really bad place you don't want to be living on credit cards and lines of credit because you're still investing you're going backwards at that point um but within reason I just wanted to throw that out there as like you know making a game out of it also manipulate yourself to uh to make sure you're investing so I don't want to get into this too much this is super high level but just really really briefly touching on these I've been I've mentioned a few times that you should change your investment over time so when you're living at home save as much as you can um use that first time uh for for first Home Savings Account fhsa um save for for marriage you know if you want to be able to uh get engaged to somebody or something like that there's there's a lot of cost believe me for that that transaction [Applause] um and then of course there's retirement as well but when you're living at home you're not all you're not only thinking about your long-term future you need you have short-term goals that you need to fit you need to probably get a car you need to get a house of some sort or rent a house um there's there's a you need one month of rent in advance before you start renting so that's uh almost a couple grand these days so what I'm trying to say is don't be spending all your money on food and games and clothes make it minimum 20% if you're living at home I think that should be the absolute minimum personally and you know if you're only making like 50 bucks a month well then you don't have a lot of money to spend get a job but uh when you're when you're living at home I don't think there's many excuses to spend all your money I think it's uh I think it's quite wasteful um and be good to your future you know when you're five years down the road you're going to be so happy that you can afford to do things and that you can afford to get into maybe a house or something like that um yeah it's uh I shoulda have Andy and Ben talk about this I when you guys were like saving every penny that you found yeah these guys were saving like 99% of their income it was uh remarkable still do no maybe sometimes no oh man so so next living at home you might still be living at home at this point but it's a different phase when you're not at school anymore when you're when you have a career you have a full-time job um if you're if you're still living at home and you have a full-time job boost your savings up like way much um I would say try to try to do some math with yourself to find out I was making $200 a month casually while I was in school now I'm making $2,000 a month somehow with with my job you know save $1,800 of that or something give yourself a 100% of your pre career income as as spending money just for fun but please do not just go buying cars and all that kind of stuff right away um there are principles I think that we talked about in our first presentation about how much of your income you should spend on your first car um there's uh there's there's good principles to put in place to keep yourself under control and if you just kind of become a person of principles it doesn't matter how much you're making or spending because your principles will guide your decisions every step of the way but if you're not living at home and you're in your early career I think you should just kind of try to hit that 10% Like 99% of people aren't doing that so you are in the v like way at the very top if you're investing 10% of your income but it's not that hard it's it's not impossible to do it is hard to do when you're in your early career um but it's not impossible so try to invest 10% I would personally say growth stocks are likely what you're looking for something that's going to grow with the market and not be super stable because you've got so much time to recover and like I said if it crashes keep buying it on sale as long as you believe that it will eventually recover then uh that's what you're looking for so when you're early in your career you can afford to take a lot of risk with your Investments uh I'm not saying to bet the farm on something that could go to zero I'm just saying to get into Investments that are more like this but are going up over time um same with your career you know you can try something be creative do something entrepreneurial or take a risky job that you think you know might not work out but it's challenging and exciting and could pay off once you are in your mid-career I would say try to invest um if if you want to retire with the same lifestyle you have now in your midcareer you need to be closer to 15% of your income net income if you expect that you're going to be able to cut your lifestock when you retire then you can stick at 10% um and again you're still looking for a diver always a diverse portfolio but probably growth is still your primary motive a little bit more of the value as well like the dividend stocks late career in your 50s um keep investing try to keep it around that 15% again and um reduce your risk so this is where you're starting to go a little bit closer to value stocks and fix fixed income and then pre-retirement transition again this is just my personal feelings I I think at if you're in your pre-retirement you should definitely have U an investment planner or a guide some professional who's helping you plan for how you're going to withdraw your income when you retire this is just a benchmark guideline it's not at all like a good um fit for everyone but start to transition approximately 60% of your existing investments into low risk because now you're at the point where very soon you will not have income anymore you'll be on a fixed income based on what you saved and um if you're still in Risky stuff and you need to go buy groceries tomorrow and your Bitcoin crashes well so so much for your groceries um so start to get into more steady Investments they're not going to grow very much but they're going to be there for you then once you're in your retirement you're truly on a fixed income you cannot recoup any losses keep your Investments consistent and never risk your principle I've I've been close to some really really awful stories when I was working at the bank of people who thought this was a great opportunity their grandson gave them a tip or asked them to invest and they lost you know like the last five years of their life's income in this investment how how do you live I I don't know like you're you're going on welfare at that point because you risked your principle much much better to you know go to the food bank once in a while and have a lower income that you understand than to risk it on something that is unlikely to pay off and could in fact lose you everything last Point these are things I didn't want to get into today but things you should probably consider if you're if you're um uh later a little bit later in your in your investment planning if you're looking at in real estate that's a whole another topic how do you start to invest in real estate there's actually quite a few Real Estate Investors in the in the the church well quite a few there there's a handful so like if you're looking for any advice or input there are people that you can talk to in the message how much do you need to retire this is a topic I didn't want to get into today just because it takes some time but it is something you know if if people if people want I could do another session I don't feel like it's it's going to cause a lot of hazed eyes in the young people but if you know how much you need to retire you can understand how much you need to invest today and so Crystal and I started with this we didn't know we we we we talked to an investment planner and we made something up but it gave us a goal and a guide and that uh that 10% is a good Baseline if you don't know but you can get much more accurate if you plan it out something we didn't talk about at all how does old age security and Canada pension plan impact your savings there's a lot of different timings you can start to take those out at 65 or if you delay it to 70 they go up why should you or when should you things to think about is your um bank or investment adviser trustworthy to help you invest I just put this in there because the easiest way to invest is to go to your Banker just like a any retail bank and say I have $500 to invest they'll put you down with somebody else and he'll hear will say hey this looks good or they'll ask you questions like how much risk you can you can take and that kind of stuff and then they'll they'll recommend something for you they have a Fisher duty to recommend the best advice for you how many times does that happen I worked in a bank and trust me they are not in it for you they are there to make their sales targets and every month there's a new flavor that has the highest return for them and they will try to find a way to fit your square peg in the round hole until it works and you know there's great Bankers there's a lot of very very honest really sincere people out there generally they have some gray hair though like if you're working with a young Banker chances are they just want to hit their target and become the salesperson of the month or something like that and it's um it's really sad because I would say I don't know I don't have a number but I would guess that it has to be the vast majority of people are investing through their bank and they just don't really understand you well enough or care they're trying to hit their own sales targets everybody that sells you something makes makes something off of it just remember that and be skeptical I'm not saying your person is a liar uh I'm just saying be a little bit skeptical whenever they advise you something challenge them a little bit um should you borrow money for leverage investing very likely not um but there are some scenarios I.E real estate business um other Ventures where it could make sense um and then should you buy life insurance and if yes what type of insurance should you be getting into so these are all questions that I would say if you've never thought about these do take some time to think and it it just starts by tomorrow morning send an email to somebody you know just take pick a topic and send somebody an email asking hey how do I start this conversation and they'll they'll give you some info um if you don't know anybody ask somebody you know uh hey do you know somebody who who could help me out with insurance or whatever um because referrals are always always a little bit safer than just calling somebody randomly or going off a social media ad finally remember wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh you have little faith take no thoughts saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek your heavenly father knows that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the moral for the morrow shall take thought to the for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof all right that is it [Applause] does anybody want Q&A or should we just sure okay but I I do a lot very and well so for a person like me who's not using any or any s directed I was hoping you just out some suggestions some blame thank you thank you yeah so brother Manuel was just uh asking for somebody who doesn't have any ideas to where to start for investing and you don't have a banker or an investment adviser he just asked if I could throw out a name of some some asset that you could maybe look at so personally I I'm probably putting around like 50% of my of my new money into just an S&P 500 in index um so that market that graph that I showed you this is Happ like the last 10 years all the bad news and reasons you should sell that was the S&P 500 okay um so I would highly invest looking at an ETF exchange traded fund m for the S&P 500 and just understand what it is if you're if you're interested in investing in it um for younger people who are maybe have more time and or more risk appetite the NASDAQ is is a very similar index but it's heavily weighted towards technology stocks that grow way faster but also crash harder um the TSX index is the Canadian version and Canada just has you know we're very exposed to resources I think oil and gas is like 20% % of those companies or something in the TSX it's quite quite high so if you want to be invested in Canadian stuff or if you have more faith in the energy energy sector um then after that I would probably look at just like really conservative things like if you want more safety these are all all the ones that I just mentioned are very like volatile but they they represent the whole market so over time unless we go into apocalypse they will continue to to go up so it barring those I would probably look at um some like I I don't have a specific name off the top of my head but like a value fund or a value ETF and these will be ETFs with again very low fees that track an index that is more focused on like Banks like you can do a bank ETF it buys like all the banks in North America and holds them and banks are stereotypically very stable they go up very slowly but they don't go down so that's kind of where I would start um so you don't do individual none names I don't do any individual stocks no I'm not smart enough for that I lost uh a lot of money at the beginning when I did that okay that's smart I forget what they were even I not not not even by M's thing no once I learned brother mvin was getting promoted I sold everything oh all right no but I don't have any individual stocks no no no I saw yeah I saw question just hold it in your face I guess um is it a good choice to invest in I mean put money in both um r one minute r r RSB n dfsa yeah I think uh especially when you're when you're starting out the question was is it good to put money in a tfsa and an RSP and um it is that's a pretty complicated discussion as to which one is better and if you don't know which one is better for you because of you know I don't know which one's better for me I personally I think right now my income is is fairly high so my taxes are fairly High I don't think I'll be making this much necessarily when I'm retired so for me now I'm transitioning more into rsps at the moment only because I don't think I'll have this much income when I'm retired so for somebody who doesn't know though like for for you at your age I would probably say taxfree savings account because your income is is likely not high enough that you're going to be triggering a lot of taxes anyways so if you invest into an RSP and your tax bill at the end of an entire year is you know $500 and you invest into an RSP like you cannot possibly get 100% of your your your taxes back so the most you're going to get is maybe $100 or so so I think that that is not as valuable to somebody who's uh who's younger um once your once your taxes start to get into like the thousands or tens of thousands that's when rsps become pretty powerful because you can do what I talked about here where you reinvest your return so does that answer your question yeah what's the age for RP investor I think you have to be 18 for either tfsa any any registered investor I think I just lost my mic is it 18 18 yeah yeah and that's another Point too with the children that are under under 18 years old I think they don't pay taxes until you're 18 or something like that well so they should look into it because they can really invest that money into your tfsas um and I think you're allowed 6,500 a year or something in your tfas but they can really gain a lot of investment room by investing when they don't have to pay taxes or do you pay taxes if you're over 18,000 a year or 20 30,000 there's a lot of room in there for young ones to make money and not be paying taxes and investing money just one clarification you don't get t tfsa room until you're 18 yes so you after you turn 18 you start acre whatever the annual limit is I think there was 7500 this year maybe so for me I was 18 when they started so I have $95,000 of contribution room I did have a note in there I didn't make a big deal out of it uh but for rsps and tfsas you need to check your contribution limits before you start and that'll be on your tax return so if you have not gotten a tax return yet you don't have any cont contribution room either uh unless you're 18 and for some reason have never had a tax bill um so when you're when you're getting when you're paying taxes you'll have a RSP contribution limit that'll show up on your T4 I think it is or maybe your T1 okay yeah and then your tfsa every year regardless of if you make money or not once you're 18 you get contribution room every single year so like guys like Daniel and Miles you you you probably have like you know 30 $40,000 of contribution room or something like that in your uh in your and they're maxed out I believe right yeah uh yeah so and I I don't know what the minimum income is for taxes I feel like you have 18,000 before you start paying taxes something like that like it's not very very high but um once you start making you know more than a basically more than $1,200 a month you'll probably start to have a tax bill did you have a question um I'm just wondering who you would suggest for um like what companies well simply was mentioned what are some of the other options to get into the ETFs yeah so for ETFs um I would really that's a good question because as with anything there are some ETFs that are just so small there's so little money in them that there is a chance that everybody just pull pulls out and like it's not like you would lose all your money they would have to redistribute I believe I'm I'm not certain exactly how those work but um I would stick to big big names personally so Vanguard is a big U distributor of ETFs Black Rock okay Bank of Montreal um there are certainly others but I I guarantee you in those three companies they will have every ETF Under the Sun there are thousands of thousands and thousands of ETFs so and and like for the one ones that I mentioned uh like the S&P 500 there's probably 50 variants of the exact same thing just just managed by different companies because they have slightly different fees or maybe they redistribute at a different time of month okay very very small differences but you know if I was comparing if say I wanted to get the ETF for S&P 500 and I was saying which one do I get I would look at the lowest fee with the highest um like
