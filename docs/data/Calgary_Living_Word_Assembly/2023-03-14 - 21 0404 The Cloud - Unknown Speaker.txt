thing of the Earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace I just want to say this before we sing this again a couple more times just bear with me I feel so encouraged this morning brothers and sisters if we struggle with anything in this world that doesn't mean that we're lost that means that we're saved it means the devil wants us it means he wants to sift us like wheat but if we struggle Just Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and all these problems all these things in the world that we struggle with they'll grow dim in the light of his grace oh turn your eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful faith and the things of the earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace one more time this morning turn your eyes Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Jesus [Music] in his wonderful faith and the things of the Earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace God bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord and I would say this not because of me I'm I'm nobody but I would say because of his word welcome to the presence of the Lord where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is oh my Where Do We Stand today brothers and sisters [Music] just want to remember sister Liz in Connecticut and the entire family I mean we would just like to bring a little bit of a a rejoicing okay um I would like to thank the Lord for the healing of sister Jermaine I'm sure we all would we want to thank the Lord for the healing of Brother John Charles it doesn't matter what a doctor has to say that's only the scientific version of what's going on but there's so much more because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world just because a doctor has a diagnosis that doesn't mean anything to a believer I want to thank the Lord for healing brother Mervin and sister Faye I want to thank the Lord for healing brother Gabriel I want to thank the Lord for watching over each and every one of us I'd like to thank the Lord go ahead brother Phil yeah I'd like to thank the Lord for this you can see this picture here there was prayer requests that went out if you could go back brother Phil or maybe forwards the one with the smoke these are all pictures of what happened last Sunday does this come up on the screen on the internet this is a picture that my dad sent me of his of his uh just in front of his driveway his driveway is directly to the right he has a farm this fire was four miles north of his farm the emergency broadcast signal went off I was sitting at the kitchen table listening to God who is rich in Mercy with my son when we heard this go off and I read what it said there was two wildfires raging east and south of Claire's home and staveley which is directly where my dad's Farm is east of clarison southeast of clarison anyways I said Isaac we need to pray right now and we just thanked the Lord thank the God who was rich in Mercy that if he could just spare dad's Farm and maybe it sounds crazy maybe it just sounds fanatical coincidental that after it was all said and done this was the picture he sent me of the smoke going by four miles north of his farm I want to thank everyone who prayed [Applause] I personally have a hard time thinking that God Almighty would hear my prayer and answer my prayer so I will say I thank everyone for their prayers because it's a many-membered body but if that wind would have shifted just ever so slightly to the southeast you can go on to the other pictures brother Phil you can see what this fire did this was a house this was someone's Farm this was someone's entire place maybe go to the next picture brother Phil I don't know if it will come up if not it's okay it's all right there was a couple other pictures there that one that was another house in behind that one it's just completely gone absolutely gone the fence posts were completely charred it was it would have been a terrible thing to have rolled through but you know that's Satan trying to rob us trying to take what's ours but aren't we so thankful that we have a Word of Promise in our day that he says that he will rebuke the Devourer for our sakes thank you I just can't help but think about this literal thing this literal fire how that can happen in our own lives how the devil will set a fire and then try and fan the flames and just get it to Roar right through our lives but remember brothers and sisters we have power in our prayer he will rebuke the Devourer for our sakes let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father how thankful we are Lord Jesus for your tender Mercy Lord Jesus so many times you you come on the scene and you help us in ways that we can't even imagine and father so so many times disaster is right at our very door and you just take it away from us you won't let it happen before the time that you have appointed for each and every one of us we just want to thank you for your grace and for your mercy Lord thank you for healing our bodies Lord Jesus thank you for healing sister Liz thank you for keeping that fire away from the family in Connecticut Lord Jesus as Satan wants to Fan the flames and Roar it through that home and through that family and get everyone all worried and shaken up Lord Jesus as a body of Believers we can stand here with the authority of you inside us and say Satan we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth not because of anything that we've done but because of what you've done Lord father I believe it with all my heart that you're just waiting to hear your sons your daughters exercise their Authority that you have given them through the adoption father Lord we just thank you for all your grace and your mercy we pray that you would just be glorified in Sister charmaine's life Lord for raising her up Lord for bringing her home Lord we pray that you would just be a mighty blessing in their lives Lord Jesus father we pray for sister Faye and brother Mervin Lord that you would just continue raising them up Lord thank you for the testimony in their home that Miles it didn't even touch him father we thank you for raising our brother and our sister up Lord thank you for healing brother Gabriel and Lethbridge Lord Jesus thank you for protecting each and every one of us Lord every single day of Our Lives where would we be without you lord father we just ask one more time that you would just bless our service here father that you would just pour yourself out now oh Father we didn't come to hear from Barry we didn't come to hear from any one of us but we've come to hear from you and you alone Lord Jesus and father we know that where you're called upon you never disappoint you always come where you're invited so father we just invite you humbly now in Jesus name we pray amen thank you brothers and sisters if you have your Bibles this morning I want to read from the book of Revelation and then from the book of First Corinthians we have uh a resurrection service this morning an Easter morning service from a little bit of a different perspective trust the Lord will bless it it's kind of the way he's been leading me actually we'll start reading with Revelations chapter 3. verse 19. Revelations chapter 3 verse 19. this is the message to the Church of laodicea we know it's a message to the age in which we live we'll just go ahead and read here verse 19 of chapter 3. as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent we know that brother Branham says the Zeal of the age is to repent I believe that's where he gets it right there verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches verse 4 chapter 1. chapter 4 verse 1. after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne let's turn over to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 13. I just love it how it's so crystal clear right there one sat on the throne not two not three not a many-membered body one First Corinthians chapter 13. start with verse 9. for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things this is Paul speaking to the Corinthians now in verse 12. for now we see through a glass Darkly there's that semicolon which is a change in the actual Direction but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your word I'm so thankful for the revelation of your word Lord Jesus through a Vindicated prophet so many times so many people must hear those words and think it just sounds so fanatical it sounds so weird but Lord we know that you never operate outside of your word and we know that the children of Israel called upon you to not speak to them anymore and to just send them a prophet to speak to them through Moses so you said all right that's what I'll do I pray Lord Jesus that Revelation would be our Keystone father and Lord we're not talking about the Book of Revelation we're talking about all Revelation that you would just reveal yourself to us a little further today Father Lord that you would speak to our hearts that we wouldn't leave this building the same that we wouldn't leave this meeting the same father that each and every one of us would just be called up hither that each one of us would be called around your throne as we've sung this morning Father we want to be in the heavenlies today we want to see what's going on in heaven we don't want to look around at this Earth father we want to draw that much closer unto you so father we pray that you would just draw close to us according to your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I know it's a real strange kind of scripture to take but you know it is the rising of the Sun brother Branham preached that Easter morning service it is the rising of the Sun and I'm just going to read a little clip from it and uh I just believe it's important he says because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live ye live also he says what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is not somewhere from the past the past tense not not 2 000 years ago and brothers and sisters here I go again right into the punch line we're talking about a resurrected Christ today the resurrected Jesus Christ of all ages not somewhere in the past if he's somewhere in the past let us help you bring him to the Future let us help you bring him to the present let us help you just maybe remember that he is the great I am an Ever present tense I am not somewhere in the future not somewhere in the past brother Branham said it very clearly that the church many times wants to put him in the future and and put him in the past and you know I would say this it's not even the church it's Satan coming around and mixing with people messing with their minds twisting words that are spoken out of the Bible and and that are preached even from the prophets through Through the Ages but Satan coming around and mixing it up to get people so balled up that they they they they get so caught up looking at what's going to happen and what's already happened but they ignore what's happening right now we know that when we come into the unity of the faith when we get into one place in one mind and one Accord for real not just something that we say but something that we do and you want to know how you're there I'll say it this way we've said it many times give yourself the test see if someone can come and kick you see if you're a dead man for real can someone come and kick you brother Branham says when you kick a dead man he doesn't even move but many of us are just not dead enough we have to die so that he will live there has to be a resurrection a resurrected Jesus Christ in every one of our lives and how does that happen every single day every single day on our knees Paul said he had to Die daily we have to Die daily we can't have a one and done I'm saved I believe the message of the hour I believed it when I was 13 years old and I'm I'm good now I can just go and live my life any old way that's not the way it works if that's what it is then that is a god of history and we need to change that he has to be the resurrected Jesus Christ in our life right now today what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power how do we know if we are alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power just just let the devil come around and kick you and see if you're alive and if you are ask the Lord to help you to die out to yourself brother Branham says it that every single Speck of us has to die amen so that he might live I'm not saying that we need to go and kill ourselves and do something weird I'm not talking fundamentally crazy like that I'm speaking by the spirit we need to make sure that the old man doesn't live that we take every single thought that comes into our minds into our hearts into captivity before we speak before we Act maybe just run it through the word maybe just say Lord what would you do you know the word says to do everything as unto the Lord huh it's not easy easier said than done I know it today I want to talk about this this Revelation though and uh all Revelation not just the Book of Revelation but this one portion of the Book of Revelation by Revelation if that makes any sense you know Jesus when he was talking to his disciples and I believe the 70 went away because he said to them unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and and and many people turned away from him then when they heard that they said this guy is crazy this what is this guy talking about I remember the law in the day back in the day the judaic law the law of Moses there was so many points in there um he was actually speaking directly contrary to the law you're not supposed to talk about blood you're not supposed to drink blood you're not supposed to have any blood in your meat and and let alone eat a human it's crazy when you think about it anyways those people were put off by his words he directly and and purposefully pushed them away just to show that many are called but very few are chosen and speaking by revelation we know that Peter when he asked who who do men say that I am I think I'm getting these mixed up but Peter he had a revelation back when he was talking about this when you if you'll Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and and he said will you go too and Peter said unto whom would we go he had that revelation it was by Revelation that he had that we know the other Revelation that I was kind of mixing in there by accident was uh you know he said who do the people say I am some said you're Elias some said you're a prophet but then he narrowed it down and said who do you say I am and John or Peter he had that Revelation he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus told him Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it unto you and and that's really what we're talking about we're speaking about Revelation it has to be revealed by the spirit to us remember we talked about another church age book it's got to be revealed by the spirit then it's got to be confirmed by the word if you're wondering whether it's some sort of fanatical thought that comes into our head by Satan if you're wondering check it by the word check it by the message of the hour and see if it's of God if it if it lines up with both of those then go on rejoicing because it will bring a manifestation of life but if it doesn't line up with them just leave it alone we just have to leave it alone we don't want to try and make it something it isn't but you know that that that quote where we're not quote but what we were talking about where Jesus had that Revelation told Peter that revelation who do you say that I am it's the same thing today brothers and sisters who do you say that he is he a god of History is the resurrection morning something fancy that happened two thousand years ago or has he come to live and and live out through our lives as a living witness to the people that we encounter and the things that we go through is Jesus just a nice man a god of History you know that there's an age right now on the earth we know this that has no idea who Jesus Christ is he's maybe at best some fairy tale that sort of has something to do with Easter maybe has something to do with the cross but not a resurrected Jesus Christ who is Alive and Well in human beings today he's got to be here with us this morning in US you know this morning I I don't know if it's a title or whatever it's just a thought but I wanted to talk about the resurrection and the life through the cloud today because we have we have the ability to talk about the message of the hour and and see God sent a prophet and all these wonderful great mysterious things that the rest of the world doesn't see but brothers and sisters I want to say this what do we see when we look at the cloud picture I want to I want to talk about the cloud picture today for a bit maybe from just a little bit of a different perspective Lord willing but it has to be a new birth the Revelation to the individual personally you know what was the first thing that Jesus did when he went to the cross when he died when he died he finally gave up his goat gave up the ghost he bowed his head he said it's finished and he bowed his head the very first thing that he did he went right back to the temple he didn't go to heaven he didn't go to hell he went right back into the temple and what did he do he tore the veil from top to bottom and showed them that this is no longer going to be acceptable there is a new way and the Covenant is going to be through Grace the very first thing that he did and you know it was in the temple where they were singing the Praises of Psalms the Praises of David singing about the Messiah and the coming of the Messiah and not realizing that they just crucified him while they were worshiping him they were crucifying him brothers and sisters remember the prophet he preached the sermon the indictment I indict this generation how many generations ago was that I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ we need to make sure that we understand where we stand how late really is it I say it all the time brother Branham said it in the message the Rapture right at the very beginning it would be astounding for you if I told you just what's really taking place in the message the rapture Jesus went over and he tore the the veil in the temple and said you know what now there's no separation there's going to be an opportunity there's going to be a doorway there's going to be an ability for man to have Fellowship directly with me now you don't have to go through a high priest you don't have to go through all the sanctification process that all of the law of Moses laid out you don't have to go through the temple you don't have to do any of the old worship methods because now there is one and one sacrifice for all but they were they were literally singing about the one they were killing at the moment but isn't it interesting how he just went ahead anyways with his plan he duped Satan Satan didn't even realize it because if he did is what the word says they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory you know brothers and sisters one thing I did want to talk about this morning is the crucifixion how in our day it's so far down the road so many years passed it's all it's almost sensationalized it's almost made to be something that's maybe not quite as terrible as it was you know Jesus was crucified he died for us and rose again and and it's all good but if you take a look at what happened in the crucifixion and I'm not going to go too graphic with it because it's horrible I'll say it this way that they didn't only just kill him but they destroyed him what they did was offered that man Jesus Christ and I'll say it that way because he was a flesh man they offered him the absolute worst possible death available to humankind if you could even imagine that the maximum amount of pain that a POS a human being could possibly endure he did so that we could be here this morning and talk about him that alone for me brothers and sisters just makes it so easy to worship Him it can actually become hard to worship him because you just don't even know what to say how do you say something like that to someone if somebody were to take and say hey you know what I know that you've got a 475 000 mortgage on your home and I know that you're out of work and I know that you're just about to lose your home and I'm gonna I'm gonna just pay off that mortgage for you and I know that you need a car and I know that you need some spending money in your bank and I'm just going to give you another 200 000 cash and I'm gonna give you uh pay off your vehicles everything that you have problems with in this world I'm just gonna fix it up for you in a situation like that it would be how do you even thank a person how do you say thank you to them what do you do for them in a situation like that think about this we were born in this world we came into this world we were born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies and I could never figure that out for the longest time why we just didn't have a hope the reason we didn't have a hope is because we didn't come into this world by the spoken word the original way that God had laid out in the Book of Genesis we came into this world through sex which is not the right way but it's the way that it happened after Eve chose to accept reasoning over God's word over her husband's word because she didn't get it directly from God she got the word from her husband now that's a contentious one right there but it's true she got the word while she was in her husband but to think about it all that Jesus did there it's just difficult to even comprehend I saw a thing that really stimulated my thinking about this and it was a trauma surgeon from today describing crucifixion and what really would have gone on in all of the oh my goodness and this man as he described it he was brought to tears and he said I can't even hardly worship I can't even hardly sing because I know what that means when we talk about the cross but he did that so that we could live he said I am the resurrection and the life and remember the story about Lazarus how he turned up four days late they sent Messengers to him and said your your brother Lazarus your friend your brother he he needs you he needs a touch from you and you're the master you could heal his body and he had to wait he had to just wait and everybody thought where who is this man here his friend is dying he's healed all these other people all these other times people he doesn't even know and now his friend lies sick and he's just going to let him die think about how crazy that sounded but then when he got there and stood before the tomb and he told the sisters hey you know what I am the resurrection and the life don't worry about all these other things that you're looking at just watch what happens now go and roll away that stone and remember they were like wow how could this be he stinks you're crazy do you know what you're doing you have no idea and he said no you have no idea because I am the resurrection and the life my four days late or right on time you know it comes down to that brothers and sisters is the book open or is the book closed is he four days later is he right on time does he give us trials and tribulations in our lives for a purpose and is he just right on time with it all remember we read in the beginning as many as I love I rebuke and I chase and be zealous therefore don't be lukewarm that's the part of the scripture that we didn't read before this because you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth I would that you were hot or that you were cold but because you're lukewarm I just can't do it so if we're being rebuked and chastened just be zealous be zealous therefore and repent Jesus spoke the words of the tomb of Lazarus I am the I am it was The Great I Am that spoke to Moses that was standing before those people saying I am the resurrection and the life can you imagine that it wasn't him just saying this person you see before you this this man I'm the resurrection of life no it was the voice behind the sign it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was Elohim in flesh it was God speaking and we know that brother Bradham brings out that story so clear that if he would have said come forth the way he said it he would have called the general Resurrection but he spoke his name Lazarus come forth and you know that's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters some people you can see they just haven't had that opportunity they haven't heard the voice of God speak their name to come forth they've hurt many people they've heard come forth but they just haven't heard their name but once they hear their name brothers and sisters there is an inoculation that takes them from heaven or from Earth and puts them right in heaven right where we just read that John immediately he was in the spirit and behold there was a throne set in heaven they're no longer looking at Earthly things they've got their eyes turned Upon Jesus but there comes a point where he says to the individual that I am the resurrection and the life and when that happens that time appointed of the father we are never ever ever the same brothers and sisters never the same I was just reading it last night you know brother Branham someone asking you know how do you know if you've got the Holy Ghost do you really know and and he says it's quite like a woman having a baby you just don't ever forget that something happens in your life and you know if we haven't experienced that if we haven't had that moment where we just know and it might not be a lightning bolt thing where you go from being a rank Center out in the world to being a saint saved by grace it might just be something else where he says you know I want you to pick up your Bible and read this scripture and you just have a scripture coming and coming and coming in your mind and you just can't get rid of it for days even sometimes some of us can be that way speaking myself personally but then when we finally sit down and read that scripture it's his hit to us it's not something just being revealed by the spirit it's actually being revealed by the spirit so it can be confirmed by the word and then when that happens it's that life that starts to take hold in us and it brings forth a manifestation and it's at that point that every True Believer has that experience we can say praise the Lord he spoke to me directly directly he gave me a scripture and that doesn't happen brothers and sisters unless you've got the Holy Ghost I'll say it that way maybe I'm wrong and I'm open for correction if someone wants to but I would say I'm sorry I don't think that everyone has ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I don't think so if we have that ability to hear from God we need to rejoice you know he said that I will not leave you comfortless I will not leave you come for this I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also but brothers and sisters we've been talking about sort of the history now just a little bit about you know the resurrection and and the resurrection of Jesus and the crucifixion and and the resurrection of Lazarus and and the words that were spoken there and how we need to see it for that but let's just bring it to our day in in Revelations chapter 10 and and verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire very very very familiar scripture that we're reading here this is what I would say this is like a keystone scripture for the message of the hour this one and Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 the message Believers the people who are the Eagles today the ones that are gathered around the carcass this is quintessential message words verse 2 and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are there and are and the thing and the earth and the things that there and are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but here it is but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets we know that brother brought him I would say it in uh sirs is this the time of the end or commonly referred to by Brother Branham is sirs what time is it but the official title is sirs is this the time of the end he talks about all of the Mysteries that have been revealed through his ministry and he knows something great is coming in his life and he thinks it's going to be his death he's actually going to die and he doesn't realize what it is but what it is is a change of his ministry we know there was three pulls of his ministry and the first poll was Discerning of spirits taking a hold of someone's hand and seeing the the spots form and being able to say it's this disease it's this disease it's this disease and the second one is being able to discern the hearts of the people first and second polls of his ministry and the third one is where they say he went off a little bit and this is what we're talking about right here this is where we live we live in the third pull of his ministry I would say that the third pull of William bradham's ministry that's where they say he went off and and it's terrible because people aren't giving it the opportunity to see if it's actually true they're just saying that I'll only look at my traditional teachings I'll only stick with my denominational words whatever the theological school and studies taught me that's what I'll believe and that's all which is so terrible you know when in in the children of Israel when they behave that way the spirit of God came through the prophet and called them stiff-necked and uncircumcised people because they don't let the spirit speak to them we don't want to be that way if God has a message for us wouldn't we want to hear it if he had a message for this day wouldn't people want to hear the message from God but they stumble at the Veil because God chose man chose to have a prophet just like man chose to have a king when the prophet told him hey you know what God is your king and he has led you your shoes haven't worn out you haven't gotten sick everything has worked out for you just flying up until now and now you want to be just like everyone else all right go on but you know what he's going to do he's going to tax you he's going to take your sons and your daughters and he's going to make slaves out of them he's going to rule you with the rod of iron and you're not going to like it after a while but hey I tried to warn you if you want that go for it we need to be careful what we ask for what we want what we long for we need to be hearing what the spirit saith unto the church so talking about the cloud when that which is perfect is come the other part of our scripture today how many believes the message of the hour is perfect it's a perfect word it's been brought to us and it's been Vindicated and for those people who have the ability to look at it they'll see that it's been an open word that this this scripture in Revelations 10 verse 7. in the days of the voice of the seventh angel messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished sirs is this the time of the end listen to some of those Mysteries that were closed up they mean opened up the the Loose Ends is what brother Brown I think he called them they were tied up he just looked after all the Loose Ends so many little things that Satan gets into or got into and messed up in the denominational worlds over time and and and twisted it up got it to a place where there was no power of God in the church because there everyone was off the word in First Corinthians 13. you know brother Branham he talks about let's just turn over there again I just we got to read this I'm just going to read the chapter just to sort of set the background chapter 13 of First Corinthians though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I want to uh I want to just stop there and just say this as we read this when we say the word charity just take and and substitute Holy Ghost because that's what charity is charity is love divine love God's own life to substitute it and make it holy ghost as we read it though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol I say Lord help me if I'm going to stand here and Minister the word let me not be a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol I had better have the holy ghost in my life and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked remember the discussion about a dead man is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice if not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away doesn't matter how many great signs and wonders we've got for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things I'm just going to stop there we'll say verse 12 for a little bit I want to talk very specifically about the the when that which is perfect is come brothers and sisters the message of the hour is Christ Jesus is perfect and he's come brother Phil if you want to cue that that which is perfect is come in 1963 a great event happened many people are very familiar with this and you know originally the picture was actually 90 degrees it was rotated 90 degrees and brother Bradham he heard the voice say to him turn it right and once he turned it right he was able to actually see what was inside this picture Life Magazine has produced a picture and I didn't show that one maybe I will in the future if anybody's interested we could show it Life Magazine did a picture and it doesn't show his face this one was a picture that was done with a bit of brown tone and this is what was inside it and this is where brother Bradham says it in uh remember the message now right at the end of 65. he says that this is uh you can see everything he gives a graphic description of the face inside the cloud in 1963 I've talked about this off and on but I'm going to start drilling down as we go forwards here I'm probably not done talking about this even in this service here but in 1963 when this happened this wasn't just God coming down like he did in the Houston Coliseum with with a pillar of fire over top of his man vindicating that he is with him and we know there's many pictures of the pillar of fire that have happened over time and and some are are really clearly identified and some are a little bit vague but many of them have been produced and shown but the Houston Coliseum is probably the most famous one where George Lacey is that his name he Vindicated it and said that the the light struck the lens and and there's there's no way that it can lie it doesn't tell psychology the camera doesn't have psychology the picture in the Houston Coliseum is is a very distinctly different picture in that it was God vindicating himself with his men this one brothers and sisters is totally different this is what we read in in uh we'll go back but in the days in Revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants but you know if you back up even further and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created all things all the things that are and all therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and and it's just a quintessential scripture verse for the message of the hour but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so what I'm getting at this morning is thank you brother Phil you can take it down the uh what I'm getting at this morning is that all of the Loose Ends brother Branham came and tidied up before 1963 before this happened and brother Branham has a quote where he says first he doesn't and then he reveals it and I didn't bring it here I should have maybe I'll do it on Wednesday or sometime soon but to look at this he ties up all the loose ends in 1862 and says throughout his ministry up until then all of the different things that need to be straightened out all the doctrinal things water baptism women's cutting their hair women preachers all the different things serpent seed all of it he didn't eat fruit in the Garden of Eden how could man man's fall come from fruit in the garden if you really examine that that whole story in Genesis if you really examine it there's way more questions than there are answers but once again it's one of those loose ends that was tidied up when that which is perfect has come we can say assuredly that this message is perfect but that has to come by revelation and it doesn't make it an exclusive Club all it is is simply asking the Lord to show us to say Lord I I maybe don't understand this but if you could just reveal it to me just a little further it might really help me but you know in verse 11 of of Corinthians 13. when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but one became a man I put away childish things I've been looking at this scripture just meditating on it you know I don't believe that he's talking about being a child here he's talking about being spiritually immature spiritually unrevealed spiritually not understanding but through growth through the process of time through the maturing process being taught being fed feeding and practicing and learning and fellowshipping around the word after a while he no longer speaks as a child just like Believers we no longer speak as children we speak as men we speak as women we speak as Sons and Daughters of God we don't talk about the denominational thing talking about how Adam and Eve they ate fruit in the garden I would say that really seriously that's childish things when you have seen the message of the hour you could just type in original sin into Google and see what comes up even Google knows the answer but many people want to turn their back on it and say no it's something else no it couldn't be that that's what the denominational world see but you know there's a purpose why there was enmity put between the woman's seed and the serpent seed and why is there a Missing Link in science between Animal Kingdom and human beings why do we think that we I'm not preaching to the choir here I know it I'm getting looks but you know it's uh it's interesting because I know there's people listening that maybe don't have the full Revelation and and I just would like to try and help encourage people to just stop and take a look take a little bit closer look and just see if God won't reveal it to you when that which is perfect has come brothers and sisters then then that from the old can just be put away with we can realize that there is a Perfection coming and I think that everybody does have some degree anyone who would be a Christian would have some degree of belief that there has to be a time when something perfect will come whether there's going to be a a death burial and Resurrection or or whether we're going to be raptured in the sky there has to be something better than what we're dealing with right now but we we read it that charity never faileth the Holy Ghost never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away there's only one thing that we'll take with us that's charity that's the Holy Ghost in our lives now brother Branham said our character is what will go with us and it will but what character do we want brothers and sisters if we're going to try and take this old Badger skin character with us we're sadly mistaken because there ain't going to be anything on the other side except for perfect love which is charity and you know what brothers and sisters when we have fear about any part of it remember what the word says that perfect love casts out all fear not some fear and not most fear it casts out all fear we have nothing to fear brothers and sisters if we've truly been baptized by the Holy Spirit we can walk right down into the valley where there's the fire just like the three Hebrew kids and say you know what I don't care if there's a fire here it doesn't matter because this isn't what God ordained for me I know that I'm going to live whether I live in this flesh or die in this flesh is irrelevant I know that I am an eternal being and not one part of me can be lost or else one part of God be lost it won't work for we know in part and we prophesy in part throughout the ages the people knew in part and they prophesied in part but you know we've talked about it many times and we'll probably drill right down into this in the future there was many many prophets in the ages that desired to look at this Perfection that we're talking about many people long to see the coming of the Lord and that's really what I'm talking about this cloud from 1963 many people are still singing we we we were waiting for the coming of the Lord but you know what just like we talked about very at the very beginning in in the crucifixion of Jesus they were singing crying out with the Psalms for for the Messiah to come and they had crucified him brothers and sisters we don't want to be like those people I want to say it with all my heart look what happened in 1963 that wasn't just a special time a cloud that happened and it just vindicates the message of the hour brothers and sisters it's later than we think if we're still here talking about this think about how close we are to the resurrection and Rapture we're not looking for the coming of the Lord we're looking for the going of the Lord and make sure make sure make sure you've got the token in your hand because the bus is about to leave the Train's gonna go the boat's gonna sail and if you don't have the token you're not getting on if you don't have the token the book isn't open to you if you don't have the token it's only open to The Sixth Seal I know some people they believe that the Sixth Seal is all that's open you know it's interesting how we can take quotes and isolate them we can isolate quotes to say what we want them to say and we can say that brother Branham said that I heard him say it I read them I read it it's right there in black and white he said that and he said that about the seventh seal too so are we going to say that the seventh seal is closed if it's not an open book brothers and sisters then we've missed it we we haven't really achieved what what the desired effect was of the message of the hour that that Eternal inoculation if it's only the Sixth Seal that's open then we're not seeing the full measure of the word in our day it's not a perfect word it's an imperfect word and for years it was but why would there be a seventh angel messenger I don't know for me it can just be so clear so so so so so so obvious but it might not be for everyone and I just pray that it would be become that obvious that it would become so real to each and every one of us that all seven seals are open we have to take the entirety of the message for a thought we have to run a thought through the entire message we can't just say isolated one point he said this because if we do that we wind out on a limb and that's where Satan loves it Satan loves it that gives us if we've only got six seals open we've got the opportunity to have another messenger because we still need a seventh messenger if there's only six seals open we can have an eighth messenger then and then we wind up in trouble we can wind up with Jesus not being God we can wind up with all kinds of doctrinal differences things that are weird but there was many many years where where they knew in part and and they prophesied in part but they knew when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with brothers and sisters I want to try and encourage us this morning if we have any old denominational baggage holding us back just put it away just just get rid of it just say everything that I think I know Lord I want to take it and put it on this sacrifice this morning when I come before you on my knees and I just want to burn it up before you I want to make it incinerate before you because I want to just clear out everything I want to purge I want to simplify my life and just allow only you as the present tense I am to just come into my heart and reveal yourself further to me according today today not yesterday and not tomorrow but right now today I need you to be God for me today and I believe it when when we get into verse 11 when that happens when we behave that way when we have that kind of attitude towards the Lord in our lives when we get into verse 11 when I was a child I speak as a child we'll begin to understand that when we were spiritually children when we didn't really understand throughout all the ages it wasn't very long ago I've heard ministers say this that they didn't really understand the message of the hour 10 years ago like they do today they didn't understand it 20 years ago like they do today think about 30 or 40 years ago brother Branham asked people in his in his meetings do you understand what's being said to you and they would some would say yeah you know maybe kind of a little uneasy and he said no you don't because it's not for you it's for another day it's for another group of people and brothers and sisters here we are we have the opportunity to take that which is perfect so we can push away that which is in part we don't have to try and hold on to Old thoughts and old ideologies and old traditional teachings you know there are old traditional teachings things that come in to the message of the hour from people that were brought out of different denominational isms and if we're not careful those things spill over into our lives and they will corrupt us they will hold us back from allowing the word to manifest in our lives I heard brother Paul say it and I'm not picking off on you brother but to have the Liberty to go and run around just do it praise the Lord give them the glory that's in your heart try it and see what happens brother Paul do you remember that time that we were in Orlando we went down to Sarasota do you remember that service goodness sakes goodness sakes alive those people got right Pentecostal that was brother Danny Stephens church you know what they were living a Pentecostal experience man the the spirit of God was moving in their lives and they didn't care who was watching they didn't care what was going on around them they just wanted to to they had to move because that spirit of God was on them that was awesome I remember looking around thinking wow the spirit of God we need to be able to just be that way you know what as long as I'm here I'm not going to judge anyone if I ever saw someone rise up in in real excitement in the in the spirit of Christ and then have somebody come over to them and say Hey you know you're going to behave that way in a service I I'd have a bone to pick we're going to have a conversation about it because where the spirit is there's liberty brothers and sisters that's the word of God Satan wants to keep us cold and indifferent lukewarm formal and Powerless but you know what like we talked about on Wednesday well we can see those trespassing Devils we can say you're a trespassing devil we can identify him and rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ and say hey you know what we need to be hot or cold and inside here I recommend we be hot we don't want to be cold we don't want to be lukewarm formal empowerless starchy and afraid because it's just the way I am and it's just the way people have always been it's the way we've always done it you know the children of Israel when they crossed over Jordan nobody had ever gone over there into the promised land the spies had gone over and ten of those Valiant men of their day said oh no we can't do it even though we got the word of the Lord but there was only two that were another spirit and they were the ones that said no by the spirit of God we can do it we are more than conquerors let's go across nobody knows what it's going to be like to go as far as we're going brothers and sisters we're so far down the road past brother Branham nobody has been here before but if we have the word as as our absolute and we have the idea that you know what when that which is perfect is come then we can do away with that which was in part I'm not saying there's any part of the message that was in part brothers and sisters I'm saying the message of the hour is in full that is perfect that has come so where are we at e wow for now we see through a glass Darkly that semicolon but then face to face brothers and sisters look at that picture again brother Phil you want to bring it up look at that picture but then we see face to face what happened in 1963 brothers and sisters brother Branham didn't come here to start a church he didn't come here to be the founder a voice of God Recordings he didn't come to start an organization he came here so that he could introduce the Bride of Jesus Christ to Jesus Christ so that he could introduce Jesus Christ to his bride his words I didn't come to start an organization I came to show people that they are the dwelling place the PowerHouse of the holy spirit of God you know in the Seven Seals not the six in the Seven Seals questions and answers in 1964. have the seven Thunders which equals the seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals not the six but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet brother Branham says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals not the six seals they were revealed in the Seven Seals he says that's what the Thunders was about they was about to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel and the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is saying this here the seventh angel says and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age I just say this like just I can't make it any clear the Seven Seals are open if the six if it's only six seals it's still a closed book brothers and sisters the the book of redemption isn't open then John would still be in heaven weeping remember he wept greatly when he was in heaven because there was no man worthy to open the book this book he descended Out of Heaven we've read it this is the Keystone scripture for the message of the hour he descends out of heaven with an open book puts one foot on the land and one foot on the sea if it was only six seals that book would be closed brothers and sisters it would not be open it couldn't be open but brothers and sisters we can say in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of Christ should be revealed we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled it's no longer hidden it's hidden in plain sight and if you want to look you'll actually see it but that's the problem when people have these weird little doctrinal things they become comfortable they become their resting place and usually what happens is they wind up having Pride which is the original sin we know that goes right back into heaven the original Pride too much of it to be able to say Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word we don't want that you know the seven Church ages the Seven Seals the seven Thunders we've gone through all seven ages we're at the seventh age now the ending of the seventh age and I would even go so far as to say this and maybe I'm wrong but let's have a discussion about it you know what we're past the seventh age or at least we're at the blending of the seventh age brother Branham said we're at the bride Age The Bride coming of Christ you know there's never a quick stop and start between ages there's always a blending I would say this for how far down the road we are I believe it with all my heart that we are into the bright age we are into the Eighth Day we're into the place where just like John was invited up into heaven he saw a door open in heaven and he was invited to come up hither to take a look and see the things that that should happen shortly Hereafter and immediately when he looked he was in the spirit and he saw on the Lord's day what was going on in heaven he was around the throne he got to see that image in heaven we know there's a special word for each age every single Church age has a special word word for it and each age is told that he that hath an ear laodicea is asked the same thing if you've got an ear listen to what the spirit saith he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church but you know he says it in uh I'm just going to turn back to it here in verse 20 of Revelations chapter 3 behold I stand at the door and knock he's standing at the door knocking now let's talk about this for a second what door is he standing at and is it actually a door we know that there's the picture of him standing outside of a door knocking and there's a lantern there and it shows him there and and brother Branham he said he had that question someone asked him he or he tells the story The Artist did everything just right except for he didn't put a handle set on the outside of that door and and and and the artist said no the handle set isn't on the outside of the door it's on the inside of the door and he Likens it to a person's heart Christ on the outside of the church knocking on the door to come in and the only way he's going to come in is if we let him in but how is that going to happen if we don't have a revelation we've got to have a spiritual revelation so you know John was given that invitation to come up a little higher he was given that invitation he was shown a door in heaven brothers and sisters I want to ask the question this morning what did that door look like did it have hinges and a handle set was it nicely stained wood or was it glass did it have nice silver polished hinges and and handles on it what was that door in heaven personally maybe I'm quacked but I believe it that it wasn't the door it's just his descriptive word I believe it was a cloud there was 26 miles high and 30 miles across because he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his ways he operates the same way so that he doesn't confuse the people but what he does do is confound the wise by acting the same and he'll reveal himself throughout all the scriptures exactly the same way you know remember in Acts chapter 1 let's turn there for a second Acts chapter 1 verses 9 to 11. Acts chapter 1. talking about the cloud Resurrection by the cloud because it needs to be a present tense Resurrection Acts chapter 1 verse 9. Jesus Christ had just spoken to them the last words that he spoke in verse 9 chapter 1 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stanji gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven remember it was a cloud that received him up but now they're saying that he was received up into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven the whole world is looking for the 60-foot Jesus the trains planes and Automobiles crashing and smashing the great disappearance of people brother Branham told us that it's going to be the secret sudden going of the Bride two will be in the field and one will be taken two will be in the bed and one will be taken two will be maybe in service and one will be taken it's going to just be a simple little thing and brother Branham says it that nobody will even know it nobody will even know it Lord help us brothers and sisters we've been shown a cloud in our day so what does this Cloud mean as I said before some some believe that it's just a vindication of God with his man other people look at the cloud and they'll say oh it was a rocket it was it was a rocket that was from from the Air Force Base that just went went wild other people will look at the cloud and they'll say that was a sign that brother Branham was hunting out a season remember what brother Bradham says I I should have that quote forgive me but he says that he'll make it happen first he'll bring it to pass and then he'll reveal it just because brother Branham didn't come right out and say start talking about all this that happened it doesn't mean that it didn't happen we're talking about a supernatural event for people to try and click a timeline and do a time stamp for every single thing that happened with it that's impossible that's like trying to put God inside a box but we know that That's what Satan does Satan wants to get us balled up and thinking that you know there's a Shadow of Doubt About This Cloud very specifically about this Cloud because if he can keep us from actually recognizing what happened when this Cloud came then he has time on this Earth but brothers and sisters remember when the church gets the true revelation of what it is then the Rapture will go I'm just going to keep harping about the cloud and the and the Rapture and the cloud and the Rapture and the Holy Ghost In Our Lives get in that token get in the Rapture get in get in get in the Holy Ghost making sure we have the token making sure that we've got that blood applied to the lentils and the door posts of Our Lives even back in Exodus they were talking about the door how important it was to make sure that blood was applied to the door it's amazing to see he is exactly the same throughout the scripture he just keeps it going the same way and it confounds the wise but it's revealed unto babes such as would learn you know to others that picture it's Christ I believe that's who we're talking to today those people that look at that picture and they see Christ they don't look at that picture and think William Branham they don't look at that picture and think voice of God Recordings there's no trademarking of that picture but they look at that picture and they think Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the coming of the Lord that's what that picture is might sound crazy but it can't be man's thinking brothers and sisters it has to be according to the word you know the word says in Revelations 3 verse 7 and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David who would have the Key of David he that openeth and no man shuttif and shutteth and no man openeth he that hath the key verse 8 I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door and no man can shut it I just love how he says this because I believe that this there are people in our day that fit this description even though this was the anointing for this age I know that works behold I have set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name I believe that just fits the perfect description of a Believer for today how many people have such great strength they can just withstand on their own he know we know he says it in perfect strength I'm I'm made strong through weakness I worded that wrong forgive me but to think about it an open door was this a literal Open Door or was this a door by revelation and that's really what we're talking about today brothers and sisters even though we see the cloud and and John maybe he saw a cloud in the sky he saw a door open in heaven you know what he was given he was given a doorway call it a doorway he was given an opportunity for a further Revelation for a higher Revelation an opportunity to see the throne room of heaven and each and every one of us that received the message of the hour we received the reward of a prophet we get to see the throne room of Heaven as well according to the description of the Prophet that door in heaven in in Colossians chapter 4 verse 3 with all praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds Revelations 4 verse 1. after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me saying come up hither and I will show Thee the things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne John given the ability to go and see inside heaven through the door brothers and sisters I believe it with all my heart we've been given a doorway today as well and it's not through William Branham the door is Jesus Christ and that cloud is Jesus Christ and that Revelation is Jesus Christ it all points to Jesus Christ and all of that points to the throne and if we can go through that doorway if we can look at that cloud and begin to see Jesus Christ in that cloud don't see brother Bradham don't see brother Branham some people have done that those are doctrines of devils those are the ones who actually go on and make another messenger and do all that stuff don't do that that's not right see Jesus remember when Jesus took the boys up on the mountain and he showed them Moses and Elijah and Peter got so excited so inspired he said oh Lord let us make three Tabernacles one for each of the then a cloud is what covered them remember it was a cloud that covered them and they heard one voice saying this is my beloved Son hearing ye him and when that voice was gone and the cloud was gone there was only one there was only Jesus there but immediately John was in the spirit brother Branham talks about this I could go into this but I'm not going to this morning about the importance of getting in the spirit so that's why brothers and sisters if you feel inspired Just go with it I'm not going to say anything about it I'm going to encourage it I'm not saying we're looking for a a Pentecostal Revival in our our building but I do believe that when the inspiration of of the Lord Jesus Christ strikes something happens to the person David when he was excited to see the ark come remember he got so inspired he danced before the Lord and and so much so that his wife got offended at him brothers and sisters we don't want to judge anyone we don't want to look at anybody we want to say if someone is having a time with the Lord Lord give me an experience like that I want to have a revelation like that I want to get inspired to that extent behold I stand at the door and knock in Revelations chapter 3 stand at the door and you know what I would say this he stands at your Revelation he stands at your Revelation are you willing to allow yourself to actually open that door of Revelation into your heart or are you willingly interested only interested in saying no I I I understand the message of the hour and and I've been taught all I can been taught and and there's nothing you can teach me I've been in it for years and years and and it's all good I'm saved by God's grace if that's the case then you know what it's not going to happen are we getting fresh revelation we have to be willing to get fresh revelation it doesn't come by me I'm not saying by me I'm saying by the Holy Ghost it has to be by the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Revelation on true Revelation only comes by the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters but why do we get together why do we go to church so that we can hear preaching and preaching of the word and and if it's in season then it's going to help perfect us that's the way it works that's why we need to be on our face before the Lord laboring to hear fresh Revelation from him but that fresh Revelation is never going to be different than the word it's always going to be leftovers we heard brother Ken say that over and over again you're just getting leftovers you're just getting something that we've talked about we've preached about but you know there is a portion of it that is a fresh Revelation I would say it there is a fresh Revelation that comes for every single age because when that which is in part is done away with that which is perfect is come brothers and sisters we see in part in Exodus 33 and he said thou can't see my face God revealing himself to Moses remember Moses he wanted to see God he asked him can I see you and he said okay here this is what I'll do and in verse 20 Exodus 33 and he said thou canst not see my face for their shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me Thou shalt stand upon a rock Revelation Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock I'll put you in a special place of Revelation Moses I'll put you in a cleft of The Rock and cover thee with my hand while I pass by I say Lord cover me with thy hand while you pass by just give me a greater Revelation put me in that cleft of the rock oh my where your glory can pass by me and he says I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen brothers and sisters what do we see in the cloud today when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with there was a time where you couldn't see God's face where you couldn't see his face but today what do we have the opportunity Unity to see and fall my goodness we know in part for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come my then that which is in part shall be done away with you so think about it brothers and sisters when I was a child I spake as a child think about the Believers speaking this when I was a child I spake as a child as a Believer when when we were children when we were babes being fed milk we spake as babes being fed milk I thought as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I was able to eat strong meat the revelation of the word started to break for me and I was able to receive it as a greater Revelation as a stronger food that that was in due season for me because when I became a man I put away childish things it's not saying that I stopped doing all childish things that I used to play games when I was a kid and I used to dance around when I was a kid and I used to do all of that no I believe there's a greater Revelation to this scripture it's about spiritual Revelation brothers and sisters Paul is telling the church in Corinthians no when you're a child you behave as a child but when you become a full adult of full age in the word something different takes place in your life you no longer speak as a child you're not talking about skim milk things and brothers and sisters we're not talking about skim milk here we're talking about the coming of the Lord No in fact we're talking about the going of the Lord do you have the token in your hand is what I want to say to the church is he a resurrected Christ Jesus in your heart today or is it just something out of the past or is it something for the future it's got to be the present tense I am right now the living Jesus Christ in our lives we're talking about spiritual maturity understanding the fullness of the word it was broken for us in our day but we have to have years to hear it and eyes to see it and most of all a heart to receive it but brothers and sisters if we have been given those things my goodness we should be able to do cartwheels up and down all over the place to know that the billions and millions of people in this world that would love to be able to have a an ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church we're just going to go and sit in his throne and judge those people those people are going to come before the throne trembling with their knees knocking because they know that unless someone's sitting in that Throne has a voice of good for them they're doomed to Eternal separation I heard a quote and and it's really stuck with me brother Branham says it that uh it's going to be our responsibility we're going to be responsible for all the people Before the Throne every single person in every single age that has the ability to hear the word we're going to be responsible for all those people that come before the weight Throne judgment because we didn't actually tell them about what we know about this great life that we have within us this great secret this great mystery it makes me want to get out of soapbox and just go and stand on every single Street Corner put on a sandwich board and say I'm a fool for Christ whose fool are you go on hand out tracks go on knock on doors think about the Jehovah's Witnesses knocking on doors and and saying have you heard about this great message are we doing that my are we going to the mission fields and trying to take it overseas and go over there but what does the mailman know do they know do our neighbors know preaching to me now I'm not talking about anybody else but myself are we ministering to the people in our own world we have the ability to speak about an open book brothers and sisters to the entire world it's a closed book in the denominational worlds they're waiting for Revelations 19 to come and open the book and and and it's too late they will have missed the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and to think that we've been given the ability the opportunity to actually come up hither just like John John is a type of the Bride in Revelations is what the prophet said he was given the opportunity to come up hither he had a door open in heaven brothers and sisters we've been given that cloud we've been given a door open in heaven an opportunity to come up hither just like John did he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't do things differently he doesn't operate outside of his word he always operates inside of his word so we want to be careful we're not looking for something that's not going to happen or something that is going to happen but we have it out of time we have to make sure that we know exactly where we are some people just look at it from a six seal perspective this just hit me this morning a Sixth Seal perspective and and there's nothing that we can do about that except for try and encourage them and pray for them I don't throw off on anybody but there's people that genuinely believe that there's only six seals open but if that's the case then the word isn't open to them it's not a perfect word it's an imperfect word it creates the ability for there to be little little glitches in the word and then we can start to actually bring in another Doctrine but then there's other people that see it as a seventh seal they see the full word open to them they're believing from a seventh seal perspective you know what it's either it's one way or the other and and I just can't really say it any other way it's either a doctrine of a devil or it's a doctrine of God it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's either the open word or the closed word it's either black or it's white There's No Gray there's no mixing in a little bit of false Doctrine with the word you've tried that and look at us now how many years down the road there's no mixing in there's no hybridizing of this word seeing through a glass Darkly in in verse 12 now we see through a glass Darkly back in that day they just couldn't see the full truth it wasn't for them it wasn't to be revealed to them I should probably quit now it's 12. I'm just about done bear with me for a few minutes see through a glass Darkly then face to face I just can't get past this scripture when I I look about that that cloud when you think about the Lord Jesus Christ the white wigged one brother Branham brings that in the message I think it's trying to do God a service I I can't remember specifically which one it is it's in 1965 but he gives so many graphic descriptions about this fairy picture but when we see him face to face someone has to see him face to face is what Paul is saying for now in in the Corinthian Church back then 2000 years ago we see through a glass Darkly we're looking through a glass but we just can't totally see through it but then once that glass gets cleaned we're going to see face to face because right now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known as even also I am known think about that when we look in the mirror what do we see when we look in the cloud what do we see we've got to come to the place when we look at our brother and our sister what do we see I don't look and see my brother and sister and see the badger skin if I do that if I could have a hard time and I trust that when you look at me brothers and sisters you don't look at me don't look at me don't look at the badger skin just look at Christ just follow Christ if we can do that brothers and sisters if we can look at the cloud and see Jesus face and see that millions and billions of people are Desiring to see what we just have the ability we just we've just been given it freely the ability to understand who we are in our day so brothers and sisters I just want to ask it what does the resurrection morning mean to you it's such a different angle to go down this road but I really think it's so important not to talk about it being just a a beautiful historical event and we could have gone down that road and I have in the past it is the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun brothers and sisters but where what good is it if even if it was just in 1965 it's got to be in 2021. it's got to be in the midst of covet the rising of the Sun in our lives today we need to see God in flesh today it can't just be once a year many people will just go to church once a year and say wow we went to church on Christmas Eve and we went to church on Easter and we've heard it said they're called creasters and there's people that will do that and maybe it works for them but that's not really what it's all about brothers and sisters that's missing it that's a that's a lukewarm formal and Powerless traditional position in Christ maybe that's an oxymoron I take that back because that's not a position in Christ that's someone that hasn't had the book open to them but whose responsibility is it to open that book to them we know the prophet has brought it he's done his part Jesus has done it he did his part What About Us Where Do We Stand are we doing our part because it's not just a pastor we heard our brother pray today it's not the deacons it's not the song leader it's not the sound technicians it's not the trustees or the treasurer it's every single one of us we all have a part to play it's the many membered body I love it because it's not many membered bodies I'll call them musicians I'll quit now brothers and sisters what do we see when we look at the at the cloud well I I just hope that with all my heart we can look at that cloud and say wow maybe there is something more to that cloud it's a door open in heaven for us brothers and sisters just like John was given a door open to heaven to a higher calling an opportunity to have that greater revelation we have been given that as well [Music] out of the rising of the sun stand with me this morning as we wrap this up here out of the rising of the sun I read it earlier because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live ye live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is as much as we talk about the prophet we talk about William Branham we talk about the message of the hour he would not want us to be stuck in 1965 1964 1963 all the way back to the beginning of his ministry 1947 he wouldn't want us to be stuck in in that if we were doing that we would be doing him a disservice we would be missing the mark we'd be missing the entire point of the message of the hour he was Eliezer gone to get Rebecca to bring her to Isaac there's so many types in the Bible but he came so that we could be introduced to the Lord Jesus Christ the present tense I am that we could look at that cloud and see Jesus that we could look at that cloud and begin to see ourselves not because we're going to try and promote ourselves just because we are in Christ and when we look at our brothers and when we look at our sisters we see Christ we see the longing in their hearts to get together and fellowship to come to service to be in Fellowship continually feeding upon the word calling and encouraging to be sending out gift cards and Christian love to brothers and sisters that's the spirit of Christ I have just a testimony that I forgot to mention [Music] sister Stella she asked me if I would just mention it someone sent her a gift card in Christian love and she said to say thank you in Jesus name brothers and sisters sometimes the things that we feel inspired to do can go a long ways for our brother and our sister don't underestimate what the Lord gives to you as a spiritual Revelation about doing if he inspires us to do something go with it try it out see what the Lord will do see if he won't bless it remember that he's just waiting for us to move he'll guide our footsteps but he's waiting for us to move he can't use us if we just sit still we need to March forward and see what he'll do because I live ye live also because he resurrected two thousand years ago he can resurrect in our hearts every single time we come to him on our knees because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live ye live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is what a resurrection this is brothers and sisters to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power by his Holy Spirit by his charity by having his love his life his very own life living out through us let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your word we thank you for your quickening power Lord we pray that if something was said this morning that would be confusing or or upsetting to anyone Lord I pray that you would just strike it from the record Lord I pray that you would forgive me because I would never want to speak out of turn and Lord I pray the words that count that you would just Quicken them with your spirit to our hearts Lord Jesus father I pray that we would all just come a little closer to your very image Lord Jesus that we wouldn't look at one another and see our brother or our sister in the carnal flesh but Lord that we would look at each other and we would see you because we know this is the coming of the Lord that's what this message of the hour is it's literally you on Earth again just waiting for that that that invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ where that Capstone that headstone comes down and sets down on the body where there's no mortar even between where when when the wife speaks it's the husband's words father we just want to be in tune with your spirit we want to be quickened by your word we don't want to be doing our own thing we don't want to we don't want to go in our own Direction father we want to follow your word very closely Lord we want to make sure that it's your spirit leading so father we pray that you would just Quicken this word that was spoken today that you would just take us all up just a little bit higher father not in in Barry's Revelation but in John's Revelation in brother branham's Revelation in the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ that we could come up into the heavenlies just like John and and be in the throne room of heaven and see one sitting on the throne Lord Jesus I pray that you would just Quicken this word to our very Souls now that we would say that you are The Great I Am present tense I am in every single one of our Lives Lord we just love you and we thank you and we bless your name today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] can we sing uh can we sing when the redeemed are gathering in [Music] 2034 there's a day coming brothers and sisters we're going to see the redeemed gathering in I
