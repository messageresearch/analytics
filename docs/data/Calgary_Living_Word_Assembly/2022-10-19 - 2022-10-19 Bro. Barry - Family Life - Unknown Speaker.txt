would just be glorified in all that said and done Lord Jesus as we go forwards now we just love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I just want to go back to what we were reading about in the past maybe pick up and carry on just as a refresher will turn to Ephesians chapter 5. then I would like to turn over to Colossians chapter 3. and then I would like to turn over to First Peter chapter 3. talking about families and roles husbands wives children we read it on Sunday brother Branham says it it's important to not try and bring too much at one time and to make sure that when we get a specific point to just continually hold it before the people until they get it and I'm sure that everyone has it but um I just feel led to go back here so Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God I believe this is the key to it all right here wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless that every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband as you turn over to Colossians chapter 3 I just want to mention this here I think it's so important that I said it before but I just want to say it again that before we get into the roles and and talking about husbands and wives as Paul mentions here the key to it all is to be able to submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God and not think that the scripture puts one above the other and not to say that she's a weaker vessel so she needs needs to submit and that's just all that's truly not the spirit of Christ because Christ gave his life for his wife and he didn't put her away and how many occasions actually when we talk about this as the Bride of Jesus Christ do we give him to truly be able to put us away because it was for a fornication right adultery that's the the reason that's what makes it legal according to the law but we don't live under the law do we we live under grace but if we really want to talk about it um as his wife how many occasions does he have to put us away if he truly wanted to according to this word my goodness isn't his grace marvelous don't we have a lot to Rejoice for goodness of God my goodness you know I just want to read from verse 16 just to bring a little context to this scripture here in Colossians chapter 3 and and we'll just go down to 20. so Colossians chapter 3 verse 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom knowing that we have an open book there's no more Mysteries right let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord that's what we did tonight my and when he hears that he comes verse 17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord if you'll turn with me over to First Peter chapter 3. I remember brother Ken preaching on on on I think this very scripture here and whatsoever ye do and word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus and you know brothers and sisters if we can't do whatever it is we want to do in the name of the Lord Jesus then we ought to do it we better just put it aside and say no I I don't need to do that because I can't do it according to the word I can't do it with the Lord Jesus whatsoever we do in word or deed First Peter chapter 3 likewise ye wives this is verse one of First Peter chapter three likewise he wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May with a conversation without sorry that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement like wise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that tonight our prayers wouldn't be hindered Lord we pray that we could take this scripture into our very Souls Lord Jesus that we could just savor it Lord when we look at our lives and we look at our our positions in our homes and in our families Lord Jesus let us also examine our position in you father Lord are we a good wife unto you Lord Jesus are we good children obeying your word unto you father Lord we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word now as we go forwards tonight we pray that you would just speak to us father once again in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just felt it would be good to have a little bit of a uh just a refresher to go back to kind of talking about the roles in the family and Lord willing we'll continue on with this study this teaching I think it's been absolutely wonderful if for nobody else just for myself I apologize if that's a little a little selfish I certainly don't mean it to be that way but it's really opened my eyes of understanding given me an understanding that I don't think I've had in the past just have a few announcements tonight we have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening we have a youth event Friday evening on the 29th we have the Men's breakfast in Edmonton on the 30th we'll have a communion service on the 31st we're going to have a fellowship and sounds like a busy Church life and it is where we certainly want to make opportunity and occasion to be able to get together as much as possible and you know if I've always said this and I'll continue to say it if you're busy and and life has its pressures I understand it there's no judgment if you can't come to anything we know that the communion table is a very important thing I would highly recommend making that a priority but it's up to you let the Holy Ghost lead you there's no pressure nobody's going to judge you and say because you didn't come you're not worthy to any one of the things that we mentioned so remember the prophet said the quote he said was the desire in the heart should be to be there not that when every time the doors are open that you actually are there physically it's important to make sure that we do get the quotes right I'm sure he says it both ways but I just want to make sure that we understand that it's truly what what's the desire in the heart of the individual right it's not a a code of conduct coming to this building every single time the doors are open are coming to a fellowship every time we get together or being a part of an event every time there's an event that's not going to save you that that might actually mislead you if you feel like that's going to do something for your salvation your salvation is is solely dependent on your ability to surrender to the word for your day to actually get get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins to repent for your sins to then get baptized and then actually get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what's going to save you and that's all that will save you it won't be a church attendance it won't be a church membership it won't be saying God sent a prophet or any of that and and I'll stop now I'll just continue on with our teaching tonight um if you can come then God Bless you that's great we did ask for I believe the the 31st fellowship if you're coming to let us know we want to RSVP that so we can make sure that we have enough Provisions for everyone we're gonna I think order some pizza and just have some fellowship so just let us know November the 12th uh 10 a.m it's a Saturday we're going to have a men's breakfast in Calgary here the details are yet to come and what I want to do is talk to the brothers I want to have an open Forum where we can get together and and talk about the the things in our lives that we deal with as brothers I believe it's important uh just right out of Titus we're going to read Titus a little bit later Titus Chapter 2 we've haven't mentioned it for a while but we're going to continue to hold this before us we want to make sure that the elders are instructing the youngers the elders have gone through battles when we come to church and we see the elders in the church it looks like everything is perfect in the elders lives the elders actually everything seems to be fine but for the young people that don't know it yet the elders have many scars in their lives many battles that have been fought many battles that they've had to surrender all of their will to get through so that the Lord could win the battle and I know that in Titus it says for The Elder women to instruct the young women but it also says for the men to instruct the young the Elder men to instruct the young men so we're definitely going to get together and we're going to see what the Lord will do there we're not trying to bring in a program or or do anything like that this is simply just trying to apply the word and and go forwards and you know what if it's incorrect then God will actually change it I trust he will and if it's correct then I trust God will bless it one way or another God will have his way and if we just sit still and do nothing then God isn't really going to do much will he we need to be able to march forward and trust that God will go we need to be strong and very courageous and not be dismayed about all the different thoughts and ideas that we encounter in our lives we've got to be willing to just trust God and so that's what we want to do here you know looking at this scripture here in uh in in First Peter chapter 3 there's so much that I want to say about the other ones but this one really caught my attention tonight thinking that you know when we look at this wives be in subjection unto your own husbands it's important to do that why is it say that it says it here that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives the wives have the occasion to save the husbands that might just be a little bit outside of the word the husbands that don't quite have the word and I thought you know that's that's interesting because many times as husbands we're the leaders all the times were the leaders we're supposed to be the head of the home and truly we are scripturally speaking spiritually speaking we are the heads of the home but sometimes we can get just a little bit out of order in the home sometimes we can get just a little bit out of order in our position sometimes we can get a little bit just off the word if you will maybe the temper gets a hold of us maybe we get distracted with something maybe something happens in our life and we just get a little bit off this word here is saying that the wife if she is in subject subjection to her husband then she has the opportunity to actually do something about it she can be the one to actually have the conversation to bring her husband back to the center line and if she's not subject to her husband how will she ever do that if she just gets upset and and does her own thing you know with this study here I've really been impressed with it because when we look at the roles when we look at wives being in subjection to their husbands and we look at husbands loving the wives and we look at children obeying the parents really what's happening when we don't follow those instructions we can say that we're not according to the word for our wives or for our husbands or or for our parents but really what's happening is it's for God because the children when you look at your parents your parents are actually the Lord for you remember whether Bradham said that your parents are actually the Holy Ghost until the age of accountability for the children to me that's such a heavy weight that's such a has so much gravity to it as a parent to think that we are the Holy Ghost for our children until the age of accountability how much pressure is that that's that's quite a bit of responsibility as a parent to make sure that we're not bringing garbage into our homes many times we can do that and say you know we will just make excuse for it and say well it's just it's just this or it's just that I would say this brothers and sisters brothers specifically if you're bringing something into your home make sure that you can do it according to the Lord that you can invite the Lord Jesus Christ to be a part of whatever it is you're doing and if you can't do that you better not bring it into your home because sometimes you can actually open the proverbial Pandora's Box you can get a devil to enter into your home enter into your family and you know it happens very easily and very subtly but try and get rid of it once you get it there it's not that easy it actually can become detrimental to the family unit and it's just easier to avoid it and that's one reason brother Bradham said you know just get the shotgun out and get rid of the television shoot it out but now now we know the devil pulled one over on humanity and and put a a smartphone in everybody's hand which gives them the ability to have access to way more than a television could even have I remember when I was a kid they were talking about the information superhighway and I didn't really understand what that meant but I do now because you don't even have to do anything we had such a weird situation a little while ago um I was just having a conversation with Isaac our oldest and I can't remember even what it was about it was just a an off-the-cuff strange conversation we had about something and suddenly my phone in my pocket started playing a song with the lyrics exactly according to the words that we were speaking and he thought that I actually played that song because sometimes I'll just be silly and I know a lot about music and a lot of songs and different things and you know I'm sorry I'm I'm human too I had a weakness when I was in the world and still pray for me but he thought that I was actually playing the song because it was about the conversation we were having and it was just the phone picked it up I don't know if I pushed the button by accident and Siri just started listening or must have been but what a strange thing these things are always listening we need to be careful what we bring into our homes but looking at this this tonight you know in my Bible it says the meek Spirit how important it is for a wife to be in her position how important it is for a husband to be in his position how important it is for a child to be in their position because when we're in our positions and we're actually living Our Lives serving according to what the Bible says for our positions we're actually serving God that way brothers and sisters don't look at it and think well I'm serving God because I go to church and because I pay my tithe and because I pray and I read my Bible those are all parts of it but what about your role how do you act in your family how do you act in your role according to your spouse or or your parents if we're out of order that way then that's how we're serving God it's important to look at it that way because that's the word of God and if we're not following the word of God are we serving God it can be real easy to to just be going through the motions and not really be in there but I just think it's fascinating here to look at this how the wives can can be in subjection to their own husbands that if any obey not the word that they also without the word may be won by the conversation of the wives the wives can intercede and you know while I was going through this and and it just struck me it's awesome how the Lord takes us and leads us turn with me over to Exodus chapter four there's an example of this in here it's a wonderful example and you know you probably know exactly where I'm going with it but it's just it's just neat to see that it's possible for a wife to save the husband when she's actually in her position but you know what happens if a wife gets out of her position and says nope I'm strong and I'm just gonna do my thing and say no way you're not going to get away with that you're not going to treat me that way I'm going to do my thing yada yada yada you know it just becomes difficult for the Lord to actually move in the situation but in Exodus chapter 4 verse 19 it's the story of zipporah brother Branham said that Moses had a temper and God gave him a wife with one also right Exodus chapter 4 verse 19 and the Lord said unto Moses in Midian go returning to Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life and Moses took his wife and his sons and set them up on an ass and returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand and the Lord said unto Moses when thou goest to return into Egypt see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand but I will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus saith the Lord Israel is my son even my firstborn and I say unto thee let my son go that he may serve thee and if you thou and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy firstborn so even right before he went down there God was given him the instructions for the final plague that's what's going to happen Pharaoh you're going to lose your son if you won't let mine go verse 24 and it came to pass by the way in the Inn that the Lord met him and sought to kill him sought to kill Moses the Lord met him and was going to kill him verse 25 then Sephora took a sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband Thou Art to me so he let him go and she reminded him she said a bloody husband Thou Art because of the circumcision you're supposed to do it but you didn't do it so I had to intercede for you and because of that you live and she recognized that she acknowledged that she made sure in case he forgot it she reminded him again isn't it interesting though it just completely dovetails with First Peter chapter 3 here that the wives when they're in subjection to their own husbands when they're in tune with their position they have the opportunity to change the circumstances when they need to be changed but if they get upset and they hold on to things and things are just being drug around and they just can't let go of stuff and they have anger and frustration and maybe fear and anxiety about their husbands they're not in their position but when they can just go on their knees and say Lord I don't know what's going on I don't like what's going on I don't trust what's going on but I know you have it all under control Lord I know you can change the circumstances because you're God and you're the present tense I am you are a God of this present time you're not the god of the future even though you are you're not the god of the past even though you are and I don't want to know you that way I want to know you of the god right now in my life I need to see you move in my family I need to see you move in my marriage I need to see you move in my children I believe the wives have the opportunity according to the word here to change the circumstances to change the situation but the wives have got to be in subjection to their own husbands they have to and it's interesting because the husbands they need to love their wives have to and you know they don't have to and say well I've got I've got to love you so I just love you I only because I love you I just love you so what does that mean to a wife a wife's gonna say yeah right I I believe it the word says that you have to love me so I get that you love me yeah but when a husband says you know honey like we've read those quotes earlier on in in this study and and you just take your wife by the hand and you look at her and you tell her honey I love you I truly love you you're my sweetheart and many times I might have upset you and done things to to actually make you feel bad and maybe I've let you down and maybe things have happened but I truly love you with all my heart you're my wife you're my sweetheart I just want to spend the rest of my life with you when you do that when you take her up into your arms and you make a little love to her brother Branham says you put your arm around her and you show her affection then you're actually living the love but when you just say I just love you because the word says I have to I have to doesn't mean anything does it she's going to say whatever buddy whatever I don't believe you and the circle will just go it'll just be like running on a hamster will anybody have a hamster anybody ever see a hamster wheel a hamster will just run Miles and Miles they say that hamsters folk run miles in a night literally miles in a night if they could but that's what happens brothers and sisters when we get in that circumstance that situation will be just like a hamster and it'll slowly go up a little bit on the wheel and it'll go back down but it'll just be running with all of its might on this wheel and and if we're not actually following the word subjecting ourselves one to another in the fear of God if we're not starting there then how is it going to work you know we talked about uh we talked about First Corinthians chapter 13. and I just think it's so beautiful because I said it before and I I'll say it again I think it was just under inspiration that I said it before but I believe that that's like a barometer a spiritual barometer for our lives if we want to see whether we're actually living our Our Lives according to a Christian Life uh I mean we know that the word Christian means Christ like right that's what a Christian Life is it's being christ-like it's not being foolish and it's it's not being rude and it's not being hurtful and it's not being vindictive it's not remembering the past it's it's being forgiving and loving we know that it's it's all of that but in in in in in in First Corinthians chapter 13 if we don't have charity it's for naught and what is Charity brothers and sisters we know that Strong's is g26 agape brother Branham brought that and uh just the definition of it is love that is affection or benevolence it's something that we do it's a affection it's it's something that we express and tonight we did that in song and and worship and we express that and Agape is is God's love that's giving the love that's beyond what we have as humans a filio love and filial love is just the feelings that we have it's it's the love that we feel in our our souls but it's still not agape love but charity charity thinking about charity and and you know brother Branham he brought the difference and and made it so clear which is so nice but when we get into agape love agape love is something that we can't even comprehend with our minds our human finite Minds we just can't even really comprehend that and like I said before husbands when we look at it and and you hear some folks talk about it uh about you know divorce and whether you can marry again and and all of this stuff the Liberty is there those are spirits that want to get into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless you know if we look at that think about it how on Earth could we ever make it to Heaven if God would look at us we said it earlier in the service I just feel so impressed to talk about it though how could we ever make it to Heaven if God actually behaved that way towards us as his bride we give him so many occasions to put us away Heaven Help Us but he has a love for us that we can't even comprehend and remember the word says that we're supposed to love our wives like Christ loved the church there should be no occasion none brother even says it you know if my wife were to do something or if I were to do something we would just take each other back but I wouldn't do it for the world I wouldn't want to hurt her I wouldn't do it for the world because I wouldn't want to hurt her because I love her that much but you know talking about charity we can talk about charity and and say that it's love because we know it's love but I believe it goes even further than that and and I know that we all do agree with that too charity is is Christ it's it's himself the the person of Jesus Christ Living out through our lives so if we don't have you know when we read this let's maybe turn over there just just for the sake of discussion tonight First Corinthians chapter 13. just look at maybe the the first four verses first first Corinthians chapter 13 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not Christ I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not Christ I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not Christ it prophetth me nothing I think it's just such a wonderful perspective to look at that way because sometimes I think this can be read and and construed and maybe an intangible way where it can be sort of out there as Charity while I don't have the chair I've got charity I've got lots of Charity I've got my charitable donations I give to the poor I I I give things away to the to the people that need it I do all these things I I serve in the church and I I've I've done all these different things in my life that people don't even know about the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing according to the word and that's fantastic but do you have Christ in your life you have to have the Holy Ghost in your life if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life it's all for nothing honestly we would be better off to keep it all and enjoy it and eat and drink today for tomorrow we die which is what the rest of the world does but we want to know that that charity is not just a charitable organization that we're a part of and it's not just me dealing with a filial love and and just being kind and loving to other human beings on Earth it's it's having that charity the Holy Ghost himself Jesus Christ the person living out through me in my life I read this before and I think I'll read it again but just the the first actually three verses tonight out of the Amplified Bible our spiritual barometer not the Amplified Bible but just just First Corinthians chapter 13 here this um you know it says in verse one if I can speak in the tongues of men and even of angels but have not love that reasoning intentional spiritual devotions such as is inspired by God's love for and in us I am only a noisy gong or a clanging symbol I just want to say this if I don't have the Holy Ghost and I I have all of that in my life then then it's just for nothing verse two and if I have a prophetic if I have prophetic powers the gift of interpreting the Divine will and purpose just understand all the Mysteries we've been given all the Mysteries all the Loose Ends from all the ages have been tied up in our day we've been given all the prophetic powers on a silver platter to this age and if I have the prophetic powers and the gift of interpreting the Divine will and purpose and understand all the secret truths and Mysteries and possess all knowledge and if I have sufficient Faith so that I can remove mountains and have not love God's love in me what is God's love in me it's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Spirit the Seal of promise if I have not God's love in me I am nothing I useless nobody and I would say that we really truly are useless nobody if we don't have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives if we don't know that we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we truly are we need to make sure and I don't mean that if we don't know if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters we're all on a journey I'm not trying to come down or throw off on anyone I'm trying to encourage us to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to know that we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to recognize that this charity that we speak about here is the Holy Ghost in our lives and with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're going to fulfill be able to fulfill those roles that are set out for us in the scriptures that we read earlier tonight in in Ephesians and in Peter and in Colossians when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're going to be able to fulfill those rules even if I Dole out all that I have to the poor providing food and if I Surrender my body to be burned or in order that I may Glory but have not love God's love in me I gain nothing brother Branham he talks about charity and and in a few places in the message he says and but you see the greatest of these is charity is love like brother Leo expressed this morning love where there is tongues that shall cease where there's prophecies it shall fail but when charity which is love it will always endure see and we know that's further on in the scripture we just haven't read that tonight for time's sake I think there is nothing greater than love and love if we can't express it now we can say that we have love we're just saying that but when we can really Express what we've said that we have then we show it in ourselves now we're not a perfect people we make our mistakes we do things that's wrong but you see love covers all of that we're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another brother Bradham speaking here he says yeah that's Warriors that's really men and women that's Gallant and you know brothers and sisters this is Brother Barry gonna throw this in here now I'm gonna say this when somebody does have the ability because of God's love in our lives to come and apologize and and try and make a wrong right the other side of the coin is the believer with love and charity in their life is going to say Amen to that they're going to say it's okay I might not be happy right now but by God's grace we'll get over it and we'll go forwards together we'll be able to move forwards as Believers because we're all going to wind up in the same place there isn't going to be a different department for for one church or the other church or one group or the other group it's all of us have been baptized into one body by one Spirit one body baptized into Christ Jesus brother random says now we're not a perfect people we make our mistakes we all we do things that's wrong but you see love covers all of that we're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another yeah that's real Warriors that's really men and women that's gallant and any man can go out to the battlefield that's got nerve enough to walk out there but when he gets knocked down then get up and try again see there used to be a song that the young young man and woman used to sing in the church if I fall if I fail see if I fall I forget how it goes let me rise and try again this is out of the power of transformation in 1965. I just think it's wonderful to look at that and see you know what's the life being lived it's that that life of Charity in our lives the Holy Ghost living out through us we've said it many times that talk talk is cheap and our children as parents can see it when when we just tell our children just just do as I say not as I do just just follow the word just just take our children and and send them to Sunday school but brother Bradham says don't just send them to Sunday school bring them to Sunday school come and sit down as parents and learn as well you know this this this this we're talking about tonight is is of the common salvation we're we're talking about being being saved Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in our lives and and and that was the only way that we're ever going to be able to succeed according to the scriptures that we've read as a husband and as a wife and as a child it's the only way and what we're talking about here is is that you know it's not just what we say it's what we do right it's the life that we live we can say it all we want but our lives speak volumes brother Bradham says that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words are how much more Our Lives brother Branham says that we can talk all we want but we speak a sermon we preach a sermon by the life that we live and what kind of lives are we living what kind you know we can say it I I just want to really emphasize and drive it home tonight we can say it about when we live our lives when we go to work and we go to school and we do all the things outside of our homes but tonight I want to drill down about our homes because what's happening behind closed doors is what counts because really when we live our lives behind closed doors that's who we really are when we're alone when it's just a husband and a wife when it's just a family unit the the children our children seeing the congruent message that they see our parents as well we're at church are we the same parents when we're at home are we the same parents when we're under pressure in different situations or do we just flip and the switch goes off and we're just a different person all together was Christ different remember Christian means christ-like being like Christ there's times where Christ got upset but not very many and usually it was with the most religious people it wasn't with his family I don't think he ever yelled back talked back to his mom and dad did he and and you know it's interesting to think I don't think his parents ever really mistreated him did they we need to make sure that we understand that as as as husbands we need to make sure that we're treating our wives correctly we're treating them nicely brother Branham says she's your sweetheart treated nicely and if you mistreat her you're not mistreating her you're mistreating yourself and I would go so far as to say this Brothers if we're mistreating our wives what we're doing is we're mistreating God because if your wife has the Holy Ghost who are you actually mistreating and wives if you're actually not submitting to your husbands who are you not submitting to if he's got the Holy Ghost but I'm sure that could be contested sometimes in our lives we'd say well maybe that husband doesn't have the Holy Ghost maybe zipporah says that about her husband he never had the Holy Ghost I had to intervene I had to step in and clean things up so that he didn't get killed but isn't that what it's about being a family we we want to actually help one another we want to see one another succeed we don't want to throw off on one another we don't want to mistreat one another I hope it's okay I'm not going too far salvation is of the Lord brothers and sisters out of the Ephesian Church age brother proud of says and the reason I'm saying it that way is it's not something that we do we don't just go and get salvation we can't just go and buy it we can't just tie their way into it we can't just do Penance like the the like the most religious I wanted to say the heathens but that's just rude salvation is of the Lord out of the Ephesian Church age brother random says now you'll notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches and he's talking out of the Book of Revelation here the the Ephesian Church Age and and what the spirit says to the Ephesians in the Ephesian Church age and we know that Paul is the messenger to the Ephesian Church age he says now you'll notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches there is no one else with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her isn't that beautiful to think that brothers and sisters we we were owned he owns us we are his inheritance and he won't lose one of his own neither indeed can there be for he alone Rod her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he is her Lord and Master she gives him all the glory and that Glory he will not share with another to think about this now as the Bride of Jesus Christ he's pretty sure about the way he wants these words written there's no accident about this church age book and there's people that want to try and edit it and take some of this stuff out of it because it gives the the devil's Liberty to actually get into the church cause it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless but the true bride of Jesus Christ says Amen to this because we know that he bought her with his own blood and and the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't the blood of a man that was the blood of God because it was the the egg that was formed and the seed Gene of God formed in the womb it wasn't Mary and it wasn't Joseph it wasn't anything to do with mankind that was all Supernatural that happened there it was God in man he is her Lord and Master she gives him all the glory and that Glory he will not share with another there's no Pope with him there's no Archbishop with him Mary the mother of his Earthly body is not with him he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he does not turn to give orders to a holy spirit for he is God eternal spirit and it is his life that's flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life this is out of the church age book out of the seven Church ages the revelation of the seven Church ages the Ephesian Church age I think it's so wonderful to look at it this is his life that's pulsating through the church it's his life that gives the bride the ability to to surrender to submit unto him because honestly we need to be looking at this scripture like we've talked about many times the book of Ephesians chapter five we're all the Bride of Jesus Christ aren't we we need to be looking at it as a wife to a husband to make sure that we're surrendering ourselves unto him because he's speaking of a mystery even though he's talking about you know the family order and everything needs to be in order and and the husbands need to love their wives and the wives need to reverence their husbands are we referencing our husband with everything that we do in word indeed the life of the church brothers and sisters is the life of Jesus Christ brother Brown goes on to say in the Ephesian Church age who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are these words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church Christ indeed is the life of the church charity Christ indeed is the life of the church he goes on to say she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of the people it has to be Christ in our lives I I just think this is so powerful and forgive me for even saying it but this is the words of the Prophet it's important I believe for us to recognize that that this is what he said this is what God wanted to say to the people through the prophet and and we might be very familiar with this but if we're not I think it's important for us to get he says as a corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him and her in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all I just think you can't deny this when you read this it just makes it so clear he says his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all many times we could look at that and say well he's talking about Christ the one that came and walked on Earth and and was here when the scriptures were written with the apostles and you know 2000 years ago but he's not talking about 2000 years ago he's talking about the bride body of Jesus Christ being the fullness of God right I'll just stop talking and I just want to read this he says as a corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs and her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last ages golden Candlestick what he was as he walked in the first stage he is even now in this last stage Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily walking in his bride today how could we ever deny any of the word if we have his Spirit living in us if we have a spirit living in us then we're going to do exactly what his word says in every place and we're not going to make excuses for it what we'll do is maybe we'll have someone point it out to us or maybe we'll hear some preaching that will bring it to our attention or maybe we'll hear it in the message of the hour and what will happen when we have his spirit will actually reckon ourselves to the word and we'll do what brother Branham said if we need to go and talk to someone and say hey I'm sorry I I didn't realize it was this way then we'll just do that and the other person will say Amen praise the Lord we're Believers don't worry about it let's go forwards anyways I apologize for maybe getting a little too excited about it but it's just wonderful to see that it's his spirit that that we're not talking about actually just getting something intangible like the Holy Ghost and saying you know I've got it and and it's going to be okay everything is fine what what we're looking at for our day brothers and sisters I think is maybe the point that I want to try and get across tonight is we're talking about the fullness of Christ the word coming of the Lord he's not going to come in in this age the way that many people think he is where it's the cataclysmic events that are going to take place before the the coming of the Lord when the coming of the Lord comes he's going to meet us in the air we're going to meet with him in the air and the clouds and the dead in Christ will first rise and then we who which are alive and remain will go to meet them in the clouds together we're not going to see him on Earth it's not going to happen that way he's coming that way in Revelations 19 but we're coming with him and we're going to be riding horses does anybody here know how to ride a horse I don't know how to ride a horse but I think we're all gonna know it'll just be something that we're able to do sometimes you hear Brother Branham talk about it people will challenge that and say there's no animals in heaven but brother Branham said you know I I felt felt my horse nudge me from behind felt my dog lick my hand I I I Jesus comes riding on a horse and he's coming from somewhere you can't really question that that's what the word says but we're looking at it tonight brothers and sisters as being his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and and you know I think in our day brothers and sisters if we make it anything less than that then we're actually taking the word and we're making it something else other than what it is for our day just like if somebody were to have said in Noah's day you know you could just make your own boat you could just get gopher wood we could just go and get together we've got some really good investors we we could go and get the exact same wood we could reverse engineer the the way that Moses built that Ark and we could build our own Ark and do it exactly the way that he's doing it and we'll just get by just fine and 125 years of doing that and maybe built a second Arc exactly like Noah's but there was only one Ark that God commissioned to be built not to right but many times if we take and and say that you know what the Lord Jesus Christ in our age is going to be anything different than the fullness of the godhead bodily in his bride then I believe we're making it something other than what the prophet brought for us just like in Moses in in Noah's day I hope I didn't say Moses earlier in Noah's day if we tried to build a different boat it wouldn't work maybe it would float for a little while but it just wouldn't work God wouldn't allow it remember we talked about it I just can't help but think tonight that song was anointed meet you in in there in in where that in thy house this is thy house this is your house Lord and it's not this building when we sing that song brothers and sisters we're not talking about that we're talking about that little Shack another example of kind of what we're talking about the the fullness of the godhead bodily in our day remember brother Branham said the angel of the Lord was standing with him and told him I'll meet you in there and brother Branham said that that that light went from where they were into that shed but he said the angel didn't move the angel stayed with him so there was something about that light something different about that light brother Branham says it in being led to the Holy Spirit 1956. run out of time here and just then now I want you to watch this and listen how it is now so you watch the difference then I heard something whipping around where where like that always goes and every time we have a healing service that's just what happens and the way it has always sounded sounded that way in the bush that time when I heard it it's always been that way and I felt it I heard it rather going moving and I looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building then there's something different between that light and the angel because he was still here with me and the light had went into that building and this angel still speaking behind me which is a big man and he said I will meet you in there I just can't help but think brothers and sisters that in there is right here in the heart of the Sons and Daughters of God and the Believers that light that life Christ himself imparting himself to this age we know that we can look back to Calvary and say the spear was put in and blood and water spilled out on the ground and that blood cell was split at Calvary so that he could come back upon his many-membered body and he came back he did according to what he said go into Jerusalem and Terry ye there until you receive power from on high and when they did that the Holy Ghost came down and it was licks of fire right cloven tongues above their heads when the day of Pentecost was fully come and that rushing Mighty Wind that swept into the room I just can't help but think I could start preaching right now because when did that happen it was when they were all in one mind and one Accord brothers and sisters they weren't all pulling in different directions thinking different things I just think it's the same way for us today when we can recognize that he wants to have preeminence in a bride body one mind and one Accord recognize that we're accepting the fullness of the word the full manifestation the full power of the message of the hour brothers and sisters we're not looking at a at a at a measure of the message of the hour many times we could look at it and say well brother Branham said you could have a teaspoon of it you know what you could have an endless Fountain of it tonight if you want it all you've got to do is ask for it and he'll give it you know many times we can get scrupled up we can get tied up we can get mixed up we can get confused we can get down we can get oppressed and depressed with Devils they'll come around and try and make us feel depressed they do it on a regular basis brothers and sisters I'm an example of it I have felt so depressed I wanted to go and actually do something to myself and and I told the story one time about being out in Victoria it's awful when you get into that position but it's a devil that's just trying to get you and you know what it is I'll tell you what it is usually there's something wrong in your life and you got to go make that thing right and until you make that thing right God will say you can go down there and you can put some pressure on my son or my daughter because they need to get right and as long as you're going down the path and not making that thing right that thing's gonna bug you and bug you it's not always like that but I would say more often than not it probably is it was with me but you know there's a way back brother brought him in the Ephesian Church age he says it and what is the way back the way the way is the way of repentance that's the way back brothers and sisters all we need to do is repent we just need to repent he says if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance this is beautiful because he speaks to the church here if a sinner has to come to God by the way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more repent he says just repent that's all we got to do is repent but what keeps us from repenting brothers and sisters it's Pride it's Pride the original sin the one that started that battle that started in heaven that's being finished on Earth God chose a bride to actually be the one to be victorious to take that power away from Satan because when the bride goes up he comes down and you know what brothers and sisters it's never been closer we have never ever been so close to the countdown of the launching of the Bride of Jesus Christ someday she's going to go up someday we're going to start seeing the supernatural appearance of people in our lives and some people have said well you'll just see them and you won't talk to them and other people have said well you'll see them and you'll hear from them and they'll say take courage brother or sister because it's only moments away you know what I don't know if it matters all we need to do is make sure we got the token have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because when that day comes and it's soon brothers and sisters it has to be soon doesn't that have to be soon oh my there's Wars there's rumors of wars Israel's in her Homeland the seventh angel messenger came and brought the message tied up all the loose has left the scene for 50 60 years now where are we at we might not even make it home tonight wouldn't that be wonderful just cross right over into Glory every one of us as we go out those doors we go out those doors into eternity bye one of these days brothers and sisters Rapture is imminent many times people will look around and say oh atomic bombs are imminent you know what before they can go off before one bomb can go off our Prophet prophesied that the bride goes home before one of those bombs can go off brother Branham says here he says if a sinner has to come by the way of God has to come to God by way of repentance then lukewarm or the backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meat for repentance here's what brother Branham says prove it by your life if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness remember the story of the five wise and the five unwise virgins they're all virgins and they all had lamps so they all had oil and they all slept every one of them were sleeping right but the cry went forth which is the message of the hour the shout and the voice and the Trump that shout went forth behold the bridegroom cometh and that's already happened brothers and sisters that's already history in that story of the five wise enough five unwise and you know they all stood up and they all trimmed their lamps because they knew the bridegroom was coming but the only difference was one had oil and one didn't have oil and we just need to make sure we've got oil in our lamps so that we can keep it burning but you know brother Bradham says certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness God will then take away its faithful messenger and its faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about Christianity but will be bereft of it we're not worrying about that tonight but this is the age which we live in brothers and sisters even though this is the Ephesian Church age brother Adam's talking about the first church age the messenger Paul went to it this is very pertinent today the shout has gone forward we need to be rising and trimming our lamps and making sure that every time we have the opportunity that we can we're getting oil to put in that lamp because we're not going to be able to trim it so that we can get that lap burning bright and clear we need to be polishing and making sure that all the old carbon is out of it that we're not actually dimming out it's got to be the Life of Christ Living out through us the fullness of the godhead bodily and I know some people will choke at that to say brother Barry you're making yourself something and you know what truly if we have the life of Jesus Christ in us then then who are we who are we you know what the word says the message of the hour says that when the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go I just can't help stop can't stop talking about it brothers and sisters and we recognize who we are what we are then the Rapture will go misses Jesus Christ misses Jesus Christ when we can recognize that brothers and sisters in every single situation in our lives when we're dealing with our husbands when we're dealing with our wives when we're dealing with our children when we're dealing with our children's teachers when we're dealing with our bosses when we're dealing with our neighbors when we're dealing with the people that cut in front of us at Tim Hortons when the people get mad at us because we cut them off on the road all of these situations in our lives misses Jesus Christ we have the opportunity to bestow Grace to this world to shine the light of Jesus Christ the literal life of Jesus Christ to the people around us or we can get caught up in the humanity of our lives and actually maybe not do that it's got to be the Life of Christ Living out through Us and how do we get into Christ brothers and sisters or how does Christ get into US is probably the more pertinent question it's by one Spirit one spirit that we're all baptized into one body not two bodies not three bodies not a whole bunch of different Church bodies one body one body we're all baptized it's the holy ghost in the man brothers and sisters I'll call them musicians now he says in hear ye him and as he goes up to the Mount called Mount Carm Mount Transfiguration sorry it must have been a wonderful place Mount Transfiguration Peter later regarded it as a holy Mount he said he was in now that doesn't mean the mountain was holy it meant the holy God was on the mountain but the Branham says this in this message oh I wish I could get that to you it's not the holy church it's the holy spirit in the church what makes it what it is it isn't the holy man it's the holy ghost in the man makes him what he is it's not it's not the holy wife that makes her who she is it's not the holy husband or the holy Child it's the holy ghost in the husband it's the holy ghost in the wife and you know what I would say this even it's the holy ghost in the child brother Branham he talks about it when should you baptize your child and he says just as soon as you can as soon as they want to get baptized you should be doing it you wouldn't want to he says it you wouldn't and this is just me paraphrasing it but you wouldn't want to actually not baptize them when they want to get baptized and then actually have something happen to them because he says that your blood their blood actually will be upon you if you don't actually let them get baptized children are smart they want to get baptized for a purpose sometimes maybe they want to do it because it looks fun and exciting but other times when all they hear about is getting baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of your sins after you repent so that you can get the baptism of the holy spirit for yourself when they hear that over and over again and they say Mommy Daddy I want to get baptized there's a purpose for it but if they hear that over and over and over again and they never act upon it what good is it a parent can only be the Holy Ghost for a child so long and then you know what happens if that child doesn't actually mature into the word if that word doesn't get into that child to the place where they take action then what happens is the world will get them and I can assure you brothers and sisters the world is empty the world is cruel the world is terrible the world has no remorse and what happens in the end is between God and the individual but when children want to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of their sins we need to make sure that we do that we meet give them the opportunity maybe stand with me tonight as we close submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God husbands love your wives wives submit yourselves unto your husband's children obey your parents because you know when you do those things you're actually obeying the word of God and you're actually submitting yourselves to God brother Branham says it clearly that wives when you do that the way you serve your husband is how you serve God and I would say this husbands the way you treat your wife is is the way maybe you want God to treat you if you I I I'm just going to stop there I just can't help but think that to me is staggering because I have mistreated my wife sometimes I
