[1:05:51] there to now first
[1:05:54] John chapter
[1:06:02] five I'm just going to start with verse
[1:06:04] one I'm putting emphasis on verse four
[1:06:06] here it could emphasize everything we'll
[1:06:08] probably go into other scriptures as we
[1:06:10] go on later
[1:06:11] on in these
[1:06:14] meetings verse one whosoever believeth
[1:06:17] that's it amen whosoever believeth that
[1:06:21] Jesus
[1:06:23] is the Christ
[1:06:26] is born of
[1:06:29] God who could even call Jesus
[1:06:33] Lord
[1:06:34] except the Lord was in
[1:06:39] youall that's right is that right amen
[1:06:42] all right but said Jesus is born of God
[1:06:45] for everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:06:47] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:06:50] by this we know that we love the
[1:06:52] children of God where when we love God
[1:06:56] and keep his
[1:07:00] Commandments do you love God sir how can
[1:07:04] you except he first loved you brother

[1:07:24] right I'm sorry sorry to take that
[1:07:26] Sidetrack there but amen let me come
[1:07:28] back to this
[1:07:31] again for this is the love of God that
[1:07:34] we keep his
[1:07:35] Commandments that's how you prove his
[1:07:38] love and his Commandments are not
[1:07:41] Grievious for whatsoever is born of God
[1:07:46] or of the word of God overcometh the
[1:07:49] world amen amen ah Hallelujah this is
[1:07:54] the victory yes that overcometh the
[1:07:57] world even our faith you may be
[1:08:02] seated sorry to keep you standing so
[1:08:04] long I want to read something out of
[1:08:07] communion just to start this out and I
[1:08:09] want you young people to listen all of
[1:08:12] us to listen but young people this when
[1:08:14] I had this on my heart to read it I
[1:08:16] didn't know how I'd read it but I just
[1:08:18] felt it spoke to all of us of course but
[1:08:20] to young people they think this is an
[1:08:22] older people's message it is not right I
[1:08:26] knew what it meant at a very young age
[1:08:29] of 12 and 14 years old to know what this
[1:08:32] message
[1:08:33] meant that wasn't something I did that
[1:08:36] was something God put in me amen amen
[1:08:40] amen amen and he can put it in you yes
[1:08:43] amen amen and if you realize after we're
[1:08:47] done here he's already put it in you
[1:08:49] Hallelujah that's right all right now so
[1:08:53] let's go on here he says I want to start
[1:08:55] at page six you're very familiar with
[1:08:58] this but brother Brandon referring back
[1:09:00] to a young age here when something
[1:09:03] happened this is communion
[1:09:05] 1965 last message he preached this
[1:09:10] recorded right right y all right he says
[1:09:16] this like in the book here I'll start a
[1:09:19] paragraph 44 if you have the book like
[1:09:21] in the book here a spot where he was
[1:09:24] talking about the two books being one
[1:09:26] now you know in the church AE book he
[1:09:28] goes over that all right makes it very
[1:09:30] clear we're not here to take our own
[1:09:32] thinking about things we had a prophet
[1:09:34] and God used the prophet to interpret
[1:09:38] his word amen how many know that amen we
[1:09:41] don't have a right to put our thinking
[1:09:43] to it right you just ask God to reveal
[1:09:46] what he said amen because what he said
[1:09:48] you'll find in the word yes right if you
[1:09:51] can't place what he said in the word you
[1:09:52] don't have what he said amen that's
[1:09:56] because God will put it in the word God
[1:09:59] will place it to you in the word right
[1:10:01] cuz any true Revelation got to be
[1:10:02] Vindicated by the scriptures right
[1:10:05] yes amen that's right all right
[1:10:09] so but he's saying here speaking back
[1:10:13] what how when he first came he
[1:10:15] said he said but that but there two
[1:10:18] books being one The Book of Life The
[1:10:20] First Book of Life coming up was when
[1:10:23] you were born that was your your natural
[1:10:26] birth see but one time but then one time
[1:10:30] way back down in there there was a
[1:10:33] little grain of life if I as I was
[1:10:36] explaining a little grain of
[1:10:40] life and to some of you young sisters
[1:10:43] out explaining that in the house this
[1:10:44] afternoon there was a little grain of
[1:10:46] Life laying there that you wonder where
[1:10:48] did it come
[1:10:50] from I was saying this take talking for
[1:10:53] myself like you self like you was going
[1:10:56] to say William brandham well 40 years
[1:10:58] ago William brandham isn't the same one
[1:11:02] tonight if somebody back there would say
[1:11:05] William brandom he was a rank
[1:11:08] Rascal anybody anybody here ever was a
[1:11:12] rank
[1:11:13] Rascal true we all were sir
[1:11:18] amen but God had something else in us
[1:11:21] thank you Lord now watch he said no
[1:11:24] matter how rank rascal you were Jacob
[1:11:27] was too
[1:11:28] yeah but God loved Jacob why because he
[1:11:33] had the
[1:11:34] seed what seed God's
[1:11:37] seed Amen in the seed God's seed God's
[1:11:42] seed is germinated or gered excuse
[1:11:45] brother brandom said it's
[1:11:46] gerz Amen a lot of seed here out here
[1:11:49] but not not every seed germatize but
[1:11:52] he's talking about this little grain of
[1:11:53] Life inside of here all right now he
[1:11:56] says
[1:12:00] here because I was a rank Rascal because
[1:12:03] I was born of Charles and Ella branam
[1:12:05] now I'm not talking about your parents
[1:12:07] being bad they had to bring you by Union
[1:12:09] into this life because you were ordained
[1:12:12] and predestinated to come
[1:12:14] here amen so it wasn't by
[1:12:19] chance that you Believers have been
[1:12:22] brought right here even to this place
[1:12:26] Amen brother brandom said there's
[1:12:28] nothing can happen to a real Believer by
[1:12:31] chance amen it's all ordained of
[1:12:36] God praise the lord we ought to walk out
[1:12:38] of here thanking the lord right now we
[1:12:40] could just close the book and say Amen
[1:12:41] it's good to be here
[1:12:45] amen amen all right
[1:12:48] so he said I was born of Charles and
[1:12:51] Ella brandom in their nature I was a
[1:12:54] sinner I came to the world a liar and
[1:12:56] all the habits of the world laid right
[1:12:58] in me I didn't even have to have them
[1:13:00] happen they were
[1:13:03] there humanly all right
[1:13:08] now but down in there
[1:13:13] also was another nature
[1:13:17] present now watch is another other words
[1:13:20] every seed shall bring forth of its
[1:13:24] kind whether natural as Eve said I got a
[1:13:27] man from the Lord that's a natural law
[1:13:30] God put in place is that right but also
[1:13:35] Adam he brought forth one
[1:13:38] too are you with me and it had to
[1:13:42] produce of its
[1:13:43] kind all right now there's another
[1:13:46] nature present see predestinated was in
[1:13:49] there by God in there by who this other
[1:13:53] nature was in there by God
[1:13:55] right all right in the same body two
[1:13:59] Natures in
[1:14:00] there I'm not talking Two Souls now
[1:14:03] don't get that in your head I'm talking
[1:14:05] about two
[1:14:07] Natures they're actually twins right
[1:14:12] amen boy I tempted to bring that message
[1:14:14] tonight I did I thought of that twins
[1:14:17] closer than you think yes
[1:14:21] sir true yeah one side of you is one
[1:14:24] twin the other side the other
[1:14:26] twin but the Elder has to serve the
[1:14:32] younger Hallelujah is that right because
[1:14:35] the younger had the birthright that's

[1:21:09] manifest himself
[1:21:11] manifest I don't want it any other
[1:21:14] way I want himself to be
[1:21:17] manifest through me and the prophet said
[1:21:20] in this age he now works in and through
[1:21:23] his bride
[1:21:25] yes is that right okay now so but
[1:21:30] something in me was calling who brought
[1:21:32] you here it was that eternal life
[1:21:34] working in the body he said it was
[1:21:38] placed there each one of us can think
[1:21:39] similar thing but watch what he said it
[1:21:42] was
[1:21:44] working before you even knew it it was
[1:21:46] already
[1:21:48] working it was already there
[1:21:51] working you just had to come to
[1:21:53] realization in your appointed time and
[1:21:55] God opened the mystery of that to you
[1:21:58] personally amen the veil was taken off
[1:22:02] and now you're looking into a glass that
[1:22:04] declares who you
[1:22:09] are amen you want to really know who you
[1:22:13] are come to this word come to the word
[1:22:17] for the season and you'll know who you
[1:22:23] are amen let God take the seal off your
[1:22:26] life and break that
[1:22:29] seal all right now so there's something
[1:22:32] in me
[1:22:33] calling that eternal life was working in
[1:22:35] the
[1:22:36] body then I was born again that little
[1:22:39] life was laying there the life of water
[1:22:41] was poured upon it the Holy Ghost was
[1:22:43] poured upon it and it began to
[1:22:45] grow and that old life was forgiven and
[1:22:48] put in the sea of forgetfulness God's
[1:22:50] forgetfulness never remembered anymore
[1:22:53] now that was a long route or go here but
[1:22:56] I hope that helps someone all right
[1:23:06] now you realize that to be his chosen in
[1:23:11] him that you had to come from the same
[1:23:15] source that Jesus
[1:23:19] came is that right you came from the
[1:23:22] same source
[1:23:25] and was eternal with him already am all
[1:23:35] right now I'm going to be drawing some
[1:23:38] things out of different messages here
[1:23:39] that I have so you bear with
[1:23:42] me in perfect
[1:23:45] Faith he States this now the only thing
[1:23:48] you have to do then is have faith in
[1:23:50] what you
[1:23:53] are have have faith in what the word
[1:23:55] says you
[1:23:57] are where does faith takes this resting
[1:24:00] place in the unmovable word of
[1:24:04] God unmovable unchanging word of God
[1:24:08] that's where Faith takes this resting
[1:24:10] place whose
[1:24:13] Faith
[1:24:16] God's God's Own Faith we're not talking
[1:24:19] about an intellectual Faith tonight
[1:24:22] we're talking about God's own faith all
[1:24:26] right and Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:24:29] God that said what he was see you're
[1:24:32] coming from the same Source through the
[1:24:35] same Source from the same Source it's
[1:24:37] written of Me Jesus went back to the
[1:24:39] scripture and said it's written of me
[1:24:41] didn't David in the Psalms and the
[1:24:43] prophets and all them speak of him he
[1:24:45] said I'm the bread of life that come
[1:24:47] from God out of Heaven amen I'm the Tree
[1:24:48] of Life from the Garden of Eden I'm all
[1:24:51] these things I am that I
[1:24:53] am
[1:24:57] amen where were you when he said
[1:25:04] that all right then what he said and the
[1:25:07] same promises that applied to him
[1:25:09] applies to his bride
[1:25:12] hallelujah amen
[1:25:15] amen amen CU you were in him you're
[1:25:19] accepted in him when you died with him
[1:25:22] we talk about the crucifixion yeah yeah
[1:25:24] it wasn't a good day but it was a
[1:25:25] wonderful day for us because we were
[1:25:28] judged in his body
[1:25:31] blameless we were judged his body
[1:25:33] therefore we don't come to condemnation
[1:25:36] there is no more condemnation we don't
[1:25:38] stand to be at the judgment and be
[1:25:40] judged we already are
[1:25:43] judged in
[1:25:45] Christ that's a wonderful
[1:25:49] day amen for us see it changes the
[1:25:53] aspect of it doesn't it
[1:25:54] it it looked terrible it looked it
[1:25:56] looked it looked terrible but that was
[1:25:59] life being
[1:26:00] given amen is that right
[1:26:05] freely poured
[1:26:07] out for judgment because the law of of
[1:26:11] God required death to transgress the law
[1:26:15] is that right and he paid it amen and
[1:26:18] you paid it in
[1:26:20] him thank you Lord hallelujah you paid
[1:26:23] it in him
[1:26:26] all right now so he says I am that tree
[1:26:30] of life in the garden I am all these
[1:26:32] things I am that I am and he knew with
[1:26:35] that perfect faith that he was the
[1:26:38] anointed
[1:26:41] Messiah Bo couldn't we go and what else
[1:26:44] he
[1:26:45] said that same spirit in you an anointed
[1:26:49] Messiah of the
[1:26:51] age is that right the same anoint
[1:26:54] anointing upon you as it was in him I'm
[1:26:56] not going to get ahead of myself here I
[1:26:58] got tomorrow and Sunday
[1:27:01] yet but that same spirit
[1:27:04] amen all right he said anointed Messiah
[1:27:09] and he's pouring himself into us and
[1:27:10] we're becoming one we are becoming one
[1:27:13] for what what's happening there's a
[1:27:16] union made here amen an invisible
[1:27:21] Union the union is invisible but the
[1:27:24] manifestation is very visible but they
[1:27:27] don't know what brings it because that's
[1:27:29] the mystery and it's not known to the
[1:27:31] public
[1:27:32] hallelujah it's only known to the bride
[1:27:35] amen but it's manifested as a witness
[1:27:38] because you're his witness why because
[1:27:40] you were with him from the beginning and
[1:27:42] the beginning was the
[1:27:45] word now we're coming into something
[1:27:48] because that word is a
[1:27:51] thought
[1:27:53] expressed
[1:27:54] in order for the thought to be
[1:27:56] manifested had to be expressed in a word
[1:27:59] and the Word was
[1:28:02] manifested Hallelujah the thought
[1:28:05] manifested that's why you and I have
[1:28:07] that word in our
[1:28:09] mouth Born Again Believers have that
[1:28:12] word of faith already in our mouth amen
[1:28:15] because it's in your
[1:28:17] heart talk about recognizing
[1:28:20] position all right now he said now let's
[1:28:23] go on on but it's my faith in God now I
[1:28:26] myself do nothing but it's my faith and
[1:28:29] the spirit of God was in him he said now
[1:28:31] I myself talking about the man Jesus was
[1:28:34] a man how many know that he was all man
[1:28:37] he was fully
[1:28:40] man
[1:28:43] amen but the spirit of God was with him
[1:28:46] upon him he said now I myself do nothing
[1:28:48] but it's my
[1:28:51] faith in God
[1:28:55] amen it's my faith and God was with him
[1:28:57] God was in him I mean and God was in him
[1:29:00] the word made
[1:29:04] manifest God was in him the word God the
[1:29:08] word made
[1:29:11] manifest other words it was God's
[1:29:13] thought of himself in the fullness of
[1:29:17] the godhead bodily as in a son form
[1:29:20] because it was God manifested in
[1:29:23] flesh
[1:29:26] amen all right now so it was God in him
[1:29:30] the word made manifest and when the word
[1:29:32] of God comes now it's turned the corner
[1:29:35] now when the word of God comes in
[1:29:40] you amen now when the word of God comes
[1:29:43] in you it's made
[1:29:47] manifest amen for you are a
[1:29:52] believer that Iden identified
[1:29:55] it the word manifested in you identifies
[1:29:58] you a
[1:30:00] Believer what am I talking about a True
[1:30:04] Believer amen there's all kinds of
[1:30:06] people say they're Believers right but
[1:30:08] there's an Evidence to a True Believer
[1:30:10] we'll come to that in a minute maybe not
[1:30:13] a minute maybe 10 minutes 15 maybe a
[1:30:15] half hour all
[1:30:17] right but it's made manifest for you are
[1:30:20] a Believer now watch what he said see
[1:30:22] and a believer
[1:30:26] is a Believer is the faith of
[1:30:32] God that
[1:30:35] moves in
[1:30:39] you don't I want you to hold that quote
[1:30:42] really close
[1:30:43] now a Believer is the faith of God we
[1:30:47] just read what faith
[1:30:49] was we know faith is a revelation
[1:30:55] faith is revelation it's not imagination
[1:30:58] it's Revelation it's something you know
[1:31:00] it's something you have it's called
[1:31:03] substance of the
[1:31:08] promise amen are you with me all right
[1:31:11] so the faith of God that moves in you
[1:31:14] that's the believer God recognizes the
[1:31:17] believer because his own faith is in him
[1:31:21] amen so now Faith a
[1:31:26] revelation is the
[1:31:29] substance amen so the faith of God the
[1:31:33] believer was already is
[1:31:37] substance of God of the
[1:31:41] word amen amen amen now let's go to a
[1:31:47] couple more scriptures here or first
[1:31:49] let's I want to take some other thing
[1:31:51] here now
[1:32:05] okay watch what we're talking about here
[1:32:07] now
[1:32:10] this God's Great secret has always
[1:32:14] blinded we're talking about God's secret
[1:32:17] now amen only in The Believer because
[1:32:21] we're referring we're showing who the
[1:32:22] believer is
[1:32:26] amen this is what I'm talking about is
[1:32:29] positionally placing
[1:32:33] you amen you are the faith of
[1:32:41] God all
[1:32:43] right God's Great secret has always
[1:32:46] blinded the wisdom of the world they
[1:32:49] can't get it they don't they just don't
[1:32:52] understand it Satan don't understand it
[1:32:54] none of the rest of them understands it
[1:32:57] but just those who are predestinated to
[1:32:59] understand it how God and Christ are
[1:33:03] one notice now he's talking about the
[1:33:05] three-fold mystery he in the this is the
[1:33:07] second fold of Christ the mystery you
[1:33:10] you'll understand where we're coming
[1:33:11] from here the next secondly the
[1:33:14] manifested Christ in
[1:33:17] you first it was God manifested in
[1:33:19] Christ then all that he poured into
[1:33:22] Christ Christ is poured into his body
[1:33:24] the bride the church all right so he
[1:33:27] said secondly the manifested Christ in
[1:33:30] you the hope of glory this is where
[1:33:33] we're at all right the great manifested
[1:33:37] God in Christ now Christ manifested in
[1:33:42] you all right now look what was once
[1:33:45] God's Great secret he had in the back
[1:33:48] part of his mind I can't cover it all
[1:33:50] now you just have to read between the
[1:33:52] lines here well was once God's Great
[1:33:55] secret great mysterious Secret in his
[1:33:57] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:34:00] believer
[1:34:03] right hallelujah amen all right that is
[1:34:08] the body of Christ amen the believer
[1:34:10] that is what he put in the heart of the
[1:34:12] believer that is the body of Christ
[1:34:14] where he put this was in his own
[1:34:18] body God's got a body God's got a wife a
[1:34:22] body has St prepared
[1:34:25] me amen is that right he's got a
[1:34:29] wife this is Adam had a wife but where
[1:34:32] was the mystery in Adam but God took the
[1:34:35] seal off of Adam and revealed the
[1:34:37] mystery and Eve couldn't come to herself
[1:34:39] until God brought her to the man then
[1:34:42] she could see where she came
[1:34:45] from that's why the seals were open that
[1:34:48] is the mystery of that seven seal it's
[1:34:51] unveiled in secret why because the
[1:34:53] secret
[1:34:54] denotes a I mean the silence denotes a
[1:34:59] secret but it's
[1:35:02] open hallelujah it's
[1:35:05] open okay I can't go any further I feel
[1:35:08] the Lord stopped me because this going
[1:35:09] on to another meeting all right
[1:35:15] now but watch what he said it's put in
[1:35:17] the hearts of the believer what was once
[1:35:20] God's Great Secret in his mind before
[1:35:22] the foundation of the world is now made
[1:35:28] manifest for you are a
[1:35:31] Believer so the faith of God is now made
[1:35:34] manifest it was hidden there was a part
[1:35:36] of himself hidden that he had in his
[1:35:39] mind of
[1:35:41] himself amen that could not be open it
[1:35:44] could not be revealed until this hour
[1:35:47] now we're right what what is the next
[1:35:49] step where are we coming to now what's
[1:35:50] the third fold Eden we're
[1:36:54] it's Christ's
[1:36:55] achievement all right
[1:36:58] now he said then it's given right down
[1:37:01] to his church what was once in God's
[1:37:02] mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus
[1:37:05] making love to the church it's a love
[1:37:09] affair

[1:45:30] we're going to go a little deeper here
[1:45:32] let's go a little deeper shall we all
[1:45:34] right
[1:45:37] now we'll go over here to what something
[1:45:40] he said now I know you've been kind of
[1:45:42] going through the church age book I
[1:45:44] guess you still are okay
[1:45:52] but
[1:45:54] John 51516 you have turned to it I'll
[1:45:57] just quote it to you you have not chosen
[1:45:59] me yes but I have chosen
[1:46:03] you now because of that you say well I
[1:46:06] had a choice you did but if there wasn't
[1:46:08] a predestinated choice already made you
[1:46:11] wouldn't have made the choice right is
[1:46:14] that right you had the choice you had
[1:46:16] free moral agency but God before you
[1:46:19] even had that opinion or had the ability
[1:46:21] to make the choice he already chose you
[1:46:23] in
[1:46:24] himself Therefore your choice is made
[1:46:28] but you had to make
[1:46:29] it amen he said
[1:46:32] ask and I'll Grant it to you but the but
[1:46:34] the word the the will of God was that
[1:46:37] you
[1:46:38] ask he already determined to give it to
[1:46:40] you but you got to ask
[1:46:43] great are you with me all right now so
[1:46:48] you have not chosen me but I've chosen
[1:46:50] you now according to the word of God the
[1:46:53] bride was chosen before the foundation
[1:46:55] of the world that choosing of the bride
[1:46:57] was purpose in himself and I read it
[1:46:59] Ephesians
[1:47:01] 1:9 and in Romans 9:11 or 911 it said
[1:47:05] the purpose of God the purpose then of
[1:47:07] God was according to a that election
[1:47:09] according to election that election
[1:47:11] might stand amen how did he elect You by
[1:47:15] forn
[1:47:16] knowledge he knew
[1:47:19] you how can you know him unless he knew
[1:47:22] you
[1:47:25] amen he knew you therefore he said my
[1:47:29] sheep know me
[1:47:31] yes because I knew them
[1:47:35] amen amen hallelujah what a rest that's
[1:47:40] right all right now that purpose of God
[1:47:44] was according to election might stand
[1:47:46] you can't read it any other way Page 149
[1:47:49] of church age book you can't read it any
[1:47:51] other way the heart
[1:47:53] purpose of excuse me let me read again
[1:47:57] the heart purpose the Eternal
[1:48:00] purpose now we'll find that Ephesians 11
[1:48:04] verse
[1:48:05] 11 that God by his eternal purpose let's
[1:48:08] just read that real quick Ephesians
[1:48:17] 3 let start verse 9 and to make all men
[1:48:20] see what is the Fellowship of the
[1:48:22] mystery

[2:05:45] God and that character had to be
[2:05:49] molded amen
[2:05:53] as Rebecca rode on those camel the very
[2:05:55] thing she watered was carrying her I
[2:05:57] wonder if you're watering that seed and
[2:06:01] it's carrying
[2:06:02] you to the one you've never even seen
[2:06:05] but your love having not seen you
[2:06:10] love while we look not at the things
[2:06:12] which are seen but the things that are
[2:06:13] not seen for the things which are seen
[2:06:15] are

[2:06:23] amen
[2:06:25] hallelujah praise the
[2:06:27] Lord hallelujah praise the Lord now I'm
[2:06:32] kind of lost track of my notes Here let
[2:06:34] me just look back here a minute all
[2:06:36] right so we see the purpose that Christ
[2:06:39] May dwell in your hearts by faith verse
[2:06:42] 17 third of Ephesians that Christ May
[2:06:46] dwell in your hearts by faith that being
[2:06:48] that ye that ye being rooted and
[2:06:50] grounded in love God is love he that
[2:06:54] hath love loves God Amen he that hath
[2:06:59] love he knows when he loves the Brethren
[2:07:02] you can love the Brethren without loving
[2:07:04] God because God is the
[2:07:08] Brethren amen amen thank you Lord God is
[2:07:11] the
[2:07:13] body amen and God is love and he that
[2:07:17] hath God hath
[2:07:20] love
[2:07:22] how the devil twist you around in that
[2:07:23] won't he y he wants to speak FAL love
[2:07:26] all the time to you right FAL Love's
[2:07:28] okay but G love is above
[2:07:31] that that rejoices in the truth right
[2:07:36] amen amen there's a lot of we could
[2:07:37] saying that but you know what I'm trying
[2:07:39] to
[2:07:40] say there's only one God's love it's a
[2:07:44] higher love amen I we don't want to
[2:07:48] preach on that because we can preach a
[2:07:49] whole message on love and we have and we
[2:07:52] will all right
[2:07:54] now they are real the the thoughts of
[2:07:57] God are real amen all right
[2:08:16] now so I think you got the idea I could
[2:08:19] take a lot of that the the see you
[2:08:22] didn't become seed by the
[2:08:24] rebirth you were seed that's right right
[2:08:27] amen that's why you can be quickened
[2:08:30] amen
[2:08:31] amen see the new birth is the word
[2:08:35] quickened you can't have a new birth
[2:08:37] unless you're the seed true amen that's
[2:08:40] it
[2:08:41] amen but we I'm going to come to the
[2:08:43] evidence of whether you are or not which

[2:08:48] just touch on it some more Hallelujah
[2:08:50] all right now so we'll just take this
[2:08:52] idea well it's some way I feel or I

[2:08:57] simpler than that yes sir that's right
[2:08:59] thank you we think that's pretty simple

[2:22:33] baptism of Holy Spirit brother Bram said
[2:22:35] that still has nothing to do with
[2:22:39] it now you have to understand what he's
[2:22:41] saying now watch he said he said that's
[2:22:43] only just a temporal gift for you yes
[2:22:47] but watch what he said the real gift
[2:22:51] the real gift is your soul down in
[2:22:57] there amen that was born of God
[2:23:01] right and that controls the whole thing
[2:23:05] to the word of God and the will of
[2:23:08] God am and there you grow up see then
[2:23:14] you're a son and daughter of God you're
[2:23:16] a child of
[2:23:18] God coming see just like a mother now
[2:23:21] you're in the bowels of the earth trying
[2:23:23] to come forth you're a Son of God coming
[2:23:24] forth you see the word says I should do
[2:23:27] this I should be born again see and you
[2:23:30] obey
[2:23:31] it you come to it all right now he said
[2:23:34] well I belong to church that don't mean
[2:23:36] one thing
[2:23:38] amen I believe in going to church y but
[2:23:42] you don't belong to church you belong to
[2:23:43] the word
[2:23:44] Christ all right then those members of
[2:23:47] Christ come together and you got quite a
[2:23:49] bonfire that's right right because those
[2:23:51] members of Christ come together there's
[2:23:54] Christ that's why we assemble together
[2:23:59] yes amen the more as you see the day
[2:24:03] approaching amen yeah right okay we
[2:24:07] should be coming together not running
[2:24:09] from the presence we ought to be coming
[2:24:10] into the presence of God for where two
[2:24:13] or three are gathered together in my
[2:24:14] name there is his presence there is he
[2:24:17] himself amen you want to meet him come
[2:24:20] come to church
[2:24:22] amen come with the body no I'm not
[2:24:25] saying you can't meet him only in church
[2:24:26] you meet him out there too amen is that
[2:24:31] right but you got a place to be
[2:24:34] fed I'll just stop there I'll let the
[2:24:37] pastor take care of all that all right
[2:24:41] now the real gift amen see you see your
[2:24:46] father he say well I'm Pentecostal that
[2:24:48] don't mean that it now that that I
[2:24:51] belong that if you don't line with that
[2:24:53] word there's something wrong right then
[2:24:55] see your real father ain't God see
[2:24:57] because that real start in your soul
[2:24:59] before that was even a spirit it was
[2:25:00] your soul that Soul didn't come from God
[2:25:04] then it wasn't a germ of God to begin
[2:25:06] you're deceived you're just in a patch
[2:25:08] of
[2:25:09] weeds amen think of that just bearing
[2:25:13] the words the world's record of the
[2:25:15] weeds coming forth acting like the world
[2:25:18] loving the world is because the love of
[2:25:20] God is not in
[2:25:22] you let's look a little further now
[2:25:25] let's what's the evidence of
[2:25:28] that the real Gene the real germ watch
[2:25:31] what brother Brown said the real Gene
[2:25:33] the real germ is a soul of God that was
[2:25:36] in God before the foundation of the
[2:25:39] world
[2:25:41] Amen then you were in God a gene a word
[2:25:45] an attribute from the beginning we just
[2:25:47] covered that all right
[2:25:53] now the
[2:25:58] evidence whether you are or not whether
[2:26:01] you have that word or
[2:26:07] not amen hallelujah
[2:26:12] thank now we know it was the thought and
[2:26:14] that thought became expressed and God
[2:26:16] brought back Jacob because Jacob alone
[2:26:17] was seed and that's you and Jacob alone
[2:26:21] had the seed is why he had respect to
[2:26:23] the birthright and the Covenant of God
[2:26:25] if you are true seed you will hear that
[2:26:30] word
[2:26:32] amen right what does hear me receive
[2:26:39] itall you will receive that word amen
[2:26:42] the spirit will baptize you into the
[2:26:45] body of Christ filling you and
[2:26:46] empowering you you're the branch he's
[2:26:49] the Vine
[2:26:51] he energizes the branch all right
[2:26:54] empowers you he will Empower you and you
[2:26:58] will receive the word for your day and
[2:27:02] age amen see how clear the true evidence
[2:27:08] is right when the word is revealed to
[2:27:13] you Jesus was the royal seed he lived in
[2:27:17] a human body and when the spirit called
[2:27:19] to him the the word manifested thought
[2:27:21] when the spirit called to it there he
[2:27:24] went to Jordan was baptized in water and
[2:27:26] upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit
[2:27:28] came upon him and the voice said this is
[2:27:31] my beloved Son hear ye
[2:27:36] him now if you excuse me this is my
[2:27:39] beloved
[2:27:41] wife hear ye
[2:27:44] him amen not her him
[2:27:48] amen because the final
[2:27:51] voice yes is the
[2:27:54] bride under her messenger she becomes
[2:27:58] the final
[2:27:59] voice to the
[2:28:02] age amen you see
[2:28:05] there it's hear ye him amen through
[2:28:10] her yes
[2:28:13] amen amen amen hear you
[2:28:17] him that's what we're talking about amen
[2:28:21] amen if you're going to hear him what
[2:28:23] about the one that came from him amen
[2:28:29] amen Eve was the mystery of Adam
[2:28:33] revealed the bride is the mystery of
[2:28:37] Christ the which is the mystery of God
[2:28:40] Amen revealed so she's the complete
[2:28:42] revelation of the whole thing right amen
[2:28:46] and that's the message of the seventh
[2:28:48] angel Revelations 10 Hallelujah the
[2:28:50] message of Revelations 10 was the
[2:28:52] seventh seal which opened all of them
[2:28:56] amen right there all right so the
[2:28:58] message of Revelations 10 the seventh
[2:29:00] seal that's Prophet said that Feast of
[2:29:02] the
[2:29:04] trumpets he said the message of
[2:29:06] Revelations 10 is the seventh seal yes
[2:29:10] and the message of Revelation 10 when
[2:29:12] the when the seventh angel shall begin
[2:29:13] to sound brother Braham said not in the
[2:29:15] beginning but his
[2:29:17] message amen the other was catching
[2:29:20] attention to the
[2:29:22] voice the sign pointing to the voice are
[2:29:25] you with
[2:29:28] me and so so he said now
[2:29:33] she oh yeah the when the voice of the
[2:29:36] seventh angel the mystery of
[2:29:38] God would be finished
[2:29:43] amen this day this scripture is being
[2:29:48] fulfilled amen amen

[2:31:05] become my son Jesus was the son the Holy
[2:31:09] Ghost positioned him as that son before
