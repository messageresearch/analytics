[38:58] tonight sister Beth
[39:00] Panetta I understand that's brother
[39:03] mervin's sister and she's been diagnosed
[39:07] with cancer of the uterus and I'm sure
[39:08] we've all seen the request go forth on
[39:11] the on the chat and we just want to hold
[39:14] sister Beth Panetta Before the Throne
[39:16] tonight and uh we know as the quote was
[39:21] listed with the request that prayer is
[39:23] the most powerful weapon placed in the
[39:26] hands of men
[39:28] there's not an atomic bomb there's not a
[39:30] hydrogen bomb that can compare with the
[39:33] power that lays in the heart of a
[39:36] Believer with a genuine
[39:39] prayer so much so that prayer the prayer
[39:43] of a Believer can change the very Heart
[39:45] Of God change the the mind of God that
[39:49] is powerful if you have a need tonight
[39:51] maybe just make it known unto him by way
[39:53] of an uplift hand as we go to him in
[39:55] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[39:57] Jesus we thank you for your goodness and
[39:59] your tender Mercy to each and every one
[40:01] of us thank you Lord Jesus that you gave
[40:04] us each one a trial father and and many
[40:08] times trials all along the way father we
[40:11] thank you that those trials don't remain
[40:13] trials that we don't stay down that we
[40:15] don't remain in the valley that as long
[40:18] as we're alive those trials in the
[40:21] hearts of your children the lives of
[40:22] your children they turn into testimonies
[40:26] and those testimonies turn turn into
[40:27] songs Lord Jesus thank you Father for
[40:30] what you've done for each and every one
[40:32] of us
[40:33] Lord father tonight we know that you are
[40:36] more than able and father we know the
[40:39] request is very specific from brother
[40:41] mvin tonight Lord is that this sister
[40:45] Beth doesn't doesn't know you in the
[40:47] power of your Resurrection the way that
[40:49] our brother knows you but father if she
[40:51] could just come to know you in the power
[40:53] of your Resurrection Lord Jesus through
[40:55] this trial that Lord perhaps it would
[40:58] turn into a testimony and that testimony
[41:00] would turn into her own song
[41:03] Father Lord whatever your desire is Lord
[41:06] let it be done father if it's healing in
[41:09] the body Let It Be father according to
[41:11] your word and father if it's for the
[41:13] saving of her soul Let It Be Lord Jesus

[41:18] so we can apply it to our very home Lord
[41:21] to our families Lord Jesus and many
[41:24] times we can't explain it we don't
[41:26] understand it but we trust you father
[41:28] because we believe Hallelujah and we
[41:31] know that you never asked us to
[41:33] understand it you never asked us to
[41:35] explain it you only ever asked us to
[41:37] believe it and father tonight we stand
[41:40] here declaring our belief in your word
[41:43] father our belief that you are the great
[41:45] I am that you are the same Pillar of
[41:47] Fire that led Israel out of bondage and
[41:50] into the Promise Land you are the same
[41:52] Pillar of Fire that's with us tonight
[41:54] amen and father we just want to commit
[41:56] this need into your your hand for your
[41:57] glory Lord and let it become a testimony
[42:00] that becomes a song Father we love you
[42:04] and we thank you Father Lord Jesus now
[42:07] we just ask that you would have your
[42:08] will and your way in our service that
[42:11] you would just grant brother Joel a a
[42:13] fresh coal off the altar Lord and father
[42:16] not so much just a fresh coal for

[44:44] hallelujah hallelujah amen God bless you
[44:48] all you may be seated for a
[44:50] moment
[44:52] amen and so I'm brother Joel from Quebec
[44:56] and so I'm
[44:57] French and I hope you don't hold that
[45:00] against me
[45:01] tonight and you can bear with my
[45:04] franglish amen I'll do the best I can
[45:07] I'm so happy to be
[45:09] here you know brother Eugene he uh he
[45:13] invited me to preach up there in
[45:15] Edmonton for like a year and
[45:19] uh finally he convinced me to come and I
[45:23] knew right away I wanted to come down
[45:25] and spend some time with B A
[45:28] Barry uh because uh we've been starting
[45:31] a new church it's been 9 months now and
[45:34] so I'm a businessman that God has called
[45:37] to be a pastor right then you see where
[45:40] this is going so I thought I need to
[45:42] spend sometime with brother Barry and
[45:45] really try to get as many wisdom out of
[45:49] him as possible as to what's coming and
[45:54] uh and so when when I met him the first
[45:57] time it was back in 2022 in the middle
[45:59] of a
[46:00] snowstorm I remember we drove up there
[46:03] to Red Deer and uh with me and him to
[46:05] meet brother Eugene for lunch and um and
[46:10] so I I really wanted you know to spend a
[46:13] little bit of time with him I didn't
[46:15] thought I'd get to preach and that was
[46:17] not the goal of the but he's been
[46:18] gracious and uh amen I reallyu want to
[46:22] be uh you know in honor and respect Che
[46:27] this
[46:29] pulpit and anyways each time we step in
[46:32] here it's a sacred Duty
[46:35] amen and so pray for us we've been uh
[46:38] starting a new church you know I was
[46:40] born and raised in that
[46:42] message um but I was born and raised in
[46:45] the in the tape church right in in the
[46:48] typ of church uh without Ministry and so
[46:52] when I when God called me to
[46:54] preach it was fairly hard because if you
[46:58] stand in a church where the pastor has
[47:00] doesn't have the right to preach the
[47:02] pastor himself it looks like a dead end
[47:05] right and um and so it was a tough road
[47:09] ahead and uh a lot of praying and
[47:12] considering the will of God because you
[47:15] always want to stay in honor and uh and
[47:18] I believe you know if you leave a church
[47:21] against something you're you're
[47:23] displeasing God right Christians were
[47:26] not called to fight against they're
[47:29] called to fight for fight for
[47:32] truth and uh and so at one point God
[47:36] laid a burden on my heart you know for
[47:39] the lost souls and for the
[47:42] backsliders which are
[47:44] many and and that burden be became so
[47:47] heavy that I had you know to to go to
[47:50] another city and and start a
[47:53] church and uh the Lord has been blessing
[47:57] what amazes me is you know I'm 36 years
[48:00] old and and uh some backsliders that
[48:05] have been in that condition for 40 years
[48:09] which means I've never met I don't even
[48:11] know exist they crossed the doors of the
[48:14] church there was that gentleman you know
[48:16] he crosses the door so I go to greet him
[48:18] and I tell him hi sir do you have a
[48:22] Bible cuz we can give you one right and
[48:24] he says I know the message my friend
[48:27] I'm like oh yeah wow like from where
[48:30] what you know and that brother had been
[48:33] under the the Thunders movement and had
[48:36] been backsliding for 40 years and he
[48:39] shows up one morning you know what
[48:42] amazes me is that those words that Jesus
[48:45] spoke on this rock I I will build my
[48:49] church they've become a reality for me I
[48:53] mean I believe in Outreach I believe in
[48:55] testifying
[48:57] but at the end of the
[48:58] day God does the
[49:00] calling and uh when someone you don't
[49:03] even know shows up and falls in falls in
[49:06] love with God again you know and and
[49:09] never leaves this is just amazing it's
[49:13] wonderful to see the grace of God and um
[49:17] and and that leap of faith you know
[49:21] stepping in the outside world living the
[49:24] church where you've been born and raised
[49:26] and and what comes with it and and to
[49:28] see the Lord bless it in such a way is
[49:31] truly amazing right and so we've been in
[49:34] that you know that part-time facility
[49:37] for 9 months and the Lord has blessed us
[49:40] and the church has voted unanimously to
[49:43] move to a permanent location So within a
[49:46] month or two we have some renovations to
[49:48] do and stuff but soon enough we'll be in
[49:51] our you know all this own little Church
[49:53] of our own and um just pray for for us
[49:57] pray for us because you know the area
[50:01] I'm in there are
[50:03] hundreds of backsliders you know people
[50:06] who came in contact with the word but
[50:09] got scared at the the abuse of the
[50:11] church and and got that's scared at you
[50:13] know these these doctrines and these
[50:16] different man-made things and left back
[50:19] for the world but God wants to send them
[50:23] amen amen none of them will be lost amen
[50:27] and so pray for
[50:28] us that the Lord you know keeps um
[50:33] blessing us in our church is called The
[50:35] Church of the open
[50:36] door and uh and I truly believe that a
[50:41] door that God open that Jesus opens no
[50:44] one can
[50:46] close amen and so there is still an Open
[50:50] Door you see our churches they're not
[50:52] supposed to be lodges and clubs
[50:57] the doors are still open am God is still
[51:01] calling if it was over we would be
[51:04] gone amen so we have to have that heart
[51:08] for the people when Jesus came you know
[51:11] physically on Earth he went to the tax
[51:13] collectors and the
[51:16] prostitutes and and zakus you know the
[51:19] chief of the Publican the head of the
[51:21] publicans and all these people and
[51:23] fisherm and that's where he went he went
[51:26] went to these broken people in need of a
[51:28] savior true and sometimes I feel that
[51:31] has been lost in in our in our circles
[51:34] we Feast on the word you know and but we
[51:37] have to remember that a church is a
[51:38] hospital that's right and so you need
[51:41] doctors you need nurses you need
[51:44] janitors you need front desk and when
[51:46] that hospital is properly functioning
[51:49] then God can start sending his patience
[51:52] he wants to build his church he wants to
[51:54] do it but sometimes you know we open the
[51:57] doors of our churches and it's just a
[51:59] whole bunch of doctors giving themselves
[52:02] high five and patting themselves on the
[52:05] back you know we're all doctors and we
[52:08] made it and we're the bride and
[52:10] something's missing a properly
[52:13] functioning hospital it's got to have
[52:15] patients in there God wants to take
[52:19] care of his people and he's using people
[52:23] to take care of
[52:25] people amen amen amen I hope you came
[52:29] with a big bowl tonight you came ready
[52:31] let's stand up for a word of
[52:36] prayer let's
[52:40] pray
[52:43] father we thank you for your presence
[52:45] among usah Lord we can feel your
[52:48] presence right and I personally thank
[52:51] you God for this wonderful special song
[52:54] that was sung that bless my heart so
[52:57] much thank you for the gifts you place
[53:00] in the body
[53:02] Lord and for the love you've gave the
[53:05] people the desire to serve and Lord take
[53:09] me out of the way
[53:11] tonight I myself have nothing to say but
[53:15] come Lord we want to hear from you come
[53:18] tonight take control of this meeting
[53:21] that anything that be said or done may
[53:23] it be For Your Glory I ask in Jes Jesus
[53:27] name amen so let's turn to 1 Corinthians
[53:31] chapter
[53:38] 9 you know I remember I told my
[53:41] daughter something one time and she said
[53:45] I get it
[53:46] Daddy and I knew she didn't really get
[53:49] it right any parents ever felt like that
[53:53] you tell your kids something and they
[53:54] say I get it but you know they don't
[53:56] really get it but you can't really say
[53:59] anything because they really think they
[54:02] do and so you just you know have to deal
[54:05] with it and and I thought to myself you
[54:07] know she'll get more as she grows up and
[54:10] amen and
[54:12] uh I I feel like these next verses we're
[54:15] going to
[54:16] read uh we think we get
[54:19] it but we don't you know we read them
[54:22] and we say oh I get it but if we'd
[54:25] really get it it would changed the whole
[54:27] course of our
[54:28] lives and so let's read 1 Corinthians
[54:32] chapter 9
[54:33] together is that thing working yes it
[54:38] is do you not know that those who run in
[54:41] a race all run but one receives the
[54:45] price run in such a way that you may
[54:48] obtain it and everyone who competes for
[54:51] the price is temperate in all things now
[54:55] they do it to obtain a perishable Crown
[54:58] but we for an imperishable
[55:01] Crown therefore I run thus not with
[55:05] uncertainty thus I fight not as one who
[55:08] beats the air but I discipline my body
[55:12] and bring it unto
[55:13] subjection lest when I have preached to
[55:16] others I myself should become
[55:21] disqualified let's turn to Romans
[55:23] chapter
[55:24] 12 and we will read first verse
[55:28] one and this is really
[55:33] a a verse I've been circling back to in
[55:37] the past couple
[55:40] years and Paul
[55:43] says in Romans 12 chapter 1 chapter 12
[55:47] verse1 I beseech you therefore Brethren
[55:51] by the mercies of God that you present
[55:54] your bodies as as Living
[55:57] Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto
[56:01] God which is your reasonable
[56:04] service and and what caught my attention
[56:07] in that verse is the fact that we would
[56:10] think that to lay our bodies down as
[56:13] Living Sacrifice would be an
[56:15] extraordinary service like something
[56:18] incredible but Paul says this is your
[56:23] reasonable
[56:25] service amen amen may God add his
[56:27] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[56:29] may be
[56:30] seated and tonight my topic
[56:37] is all right a
[56:40] timeout a timeout now I'm sure you all
[56:43] know what a timeout is right let's say
[56:47] in
[56:48] sports if for example the Calgary Flames
[56:51] are losing a
[56:52] game and we all know they do
[56:59] and and now the coach towards the end of
[57:02] the game will say okay time out and so a
[57:05] timeout is is a time where the the clock
[57:08] still
[57:09] runs but the game is stopped right they
[57:14] take a time out to assess what's what's
[57:17] going on and what's happening and why
[57:19] they losing the game and take time to
[57:22] reflect for a couple minutes on what's
[57:25] Happening and that's what I want us to
[57:27] do because tonight I want to talk about
[57:31] the Christian Life and throughout the
[57:33] night we will take some timeouts and we
[57:37] will take time to think of our own
[57:40] Christian lives that's what we'll do and
[57:43] so for a moment I want to speak on how
[57:46] to live your life for
[57:50] Christ how to live your life for Christ
[57:52] because there are three powers
[57:56] that motivates Our Lives as human beings
[57:59] not only our Christian life but
[58:01] everything we do in life is motivated by
[58:05] one of these three powers which are
[58:09] passion
[58:11] Duty or
[58:14] tradition either or it's either passion
[58:18] or Duty or tradition and so before we
[58:23] get into the spiritual side of things I
[58:26] I want us to use some real life examples
[58:29] to really understand what I'm talking
[58:31] about and so I would like to see the
[58:35] hands raised of everybody who loves
[58:37] talking on the phone the ones who really
[58:40] love you know to pick up the phone and
[58:44] talk yeah one two you see normally we
[58:50] get between zero and five hands only
[58:53] pretty much nobody loves talking on
[58:56] phone right yet take a young man about
[59:00] 20 years old that falls in love with a
[59:03] young woman he with a young
[59:05] girl and and that young man will spend
[59:10] countless
[59:11] hours on the
[59:14] phone with his
[59:16] girlfriend talking and when they have
[59:19] nothing else to say they will still stay
[59:22] on the phone and listen to each other's
[59:25] breath
[59:27] true true yet we all hate to talk on the
[59:31] phone right and then that exact same
[59:35] young man tell him he has to call the
[59:37] government you know to put something
[59:41] straight with his tax report or
[59:42] something he has to call right it's it's
[59:45] his duty to call as as a citizen try to
[59:48] give him that phone and have him calling
[59:51] he always puts it back to tomorrow like
[59:53] it's going to be tomorrow it's going to
[59:54] be tomorrow it's hard to take up the
[59:57] phone when it's a duty to do it and that
[1:00:02] same young man you know on on New Year's
[1:00:05] Eve or something will pick up that phone
[1:00:07] without even thinking and call Grandma
[1:00:10] and say happy New Year grandma that call
[1:00:14] is easy but it's not lasting for hours
[1:00:17] right it's easy it's tradition he's been
[1:00:20] doing it for 20 something years it's an
[1:00:23] easy call but it's a short call
[1:00:26] there's not much to say right there's no
[1:00:30] passion in there it's tradition and that
[1:00:32] honestly reminds me of some bedtime
[1:00:35] prayers you know they're easy they're
[1:00:38] short not much to
[1:00:40] say and so in our lives we do are
[1:00:44] motivated by any of these three powers
[1:00:48] think of you know a a new Mama she's got
[1:00:52] this brand new baby it's it's 6 months
[1:00:55] old or three months old she hasn't sleep
[1:00:58] she hasn't sleep for 5 days in a row and
[1:01:02] then she finally falls asleep and half
[1:01:05] an hour in the baby does just that
[1:01:08] little sound like just that little bitty
[1:01:12] sound and she wakes up like that and
[1:01:15] runs to that baby despite her being so
[1:01:19] tired she runs there to see if that baby
[1:01:22] is okay meanwhile the next morning
[1:01:27] that he's got an alarm set to go to
[1:01:29] work he has to wake up and so he snoozes
[1:01:33] that alarm like three times and crawls
[1:01:36] out of bed and goes to work why is that
[1:01:41] it's because mama is motivated by
[1:01:43] Passion by love for a baby but daddy is
[1:01:47] motivated by Duty I have to put bread on
[1:01:50] the table that is my
[1:01:53] duty you see the difference
[1:01:59] H if I tell
[1:02:01] you I want to go to Ukraine to be a
[1:02:04] missionary you'd say
[1:02:06] wow that brother is really passionate
[1:02:09] right and if we' compare that with
[1:02:12] Jehovah Witnesses for example knocking
[1:02:14] on doors right and they have to do it
[1:02:17] it's a duty that's hard that's really
[1:02:20] hard and then the tradition of going to
[1:02:23] church for a good old Catholic going to
[1:02:25] church you know at Easter or in
[1:02:27] Christmas and you see that you can
[1:02:29] operate your religion at three different
[1:02:32] levels depending on what motivates
[1:02:36] you each individual operates in or
[1:02:41] within these three levels depending what
[1:02:44] he's
[1:02:45] doing we all we all operate under those
[1:02:50] three forces we do and so the way we
[1:02:54] approach anything most most likely
[1:02:56] influence our success and our
[1:02:59] achievements you see I play sport I play
[1:03:03] hockey but I don't have the
[1:03:07] dedication nor the body of an athlet an
[1:03:10] athlete right it's just I might have the
[1:03:13] talent raw talent I might be pretty good
[1:03:16] at it but the passion that would drive
[1:03:18] me to make the sacrifices to get there
[1:03:21] is not there and I want you to notice
[1:03:24] how Paul says
[1:03:26] I don't run just for fun I don't fight
[1:03:30] like I Spar like I show up I show off
[1:03:34] but but I I fight you see my eyes on the
[1:03:38] price notice Paul uses sport to make a
[1:03:42] point here and and these these athletes
[1:03:46] you know their eyes on are on a
[1:03:48] corruptible price and they put their
[1:03:51] body through pain and they make
[1:03:53] sacrifices to win the race and get the
[1:03:57] price and Paul says I discipline my body
[1:04:01] and bring it unto
[1:04:03] subjection and now I want to say that
[1:04:06] tonight I believe there is only one way
[1:04:09] to live the Christian Life and it is to
[1:04:12] be passionate about it am I believe it's
[1:04:15] the only way but maybe someone in here
[1:04:17] tonight would say I've never been driven
[1:04:21] by passion in my Christian Life you know
[1:04:24] I've never talked to the Lord for hours
[1:04:26] straight till I have nothing more to say
[1:04:28] and then still hang on to listen to the
[1:04:31] Breath of
[1:04:33] God I did it for my girlfriend but I
[1:04:35] never done such a thing for the Lord
[1:04:38] right my friend passion birs in love and
[1:04:43] so when you truly love something or
[1:04:46] someone you are
[1:04:48] passionate and now we tend to think as
[1:04:51] human beings that if someone is good at
[1:04:54] something then he must be passionate
[1:04:56] right good in sport passionate in sport
[1:04:59] good Christian my that brother is such a
[1:05:02] good Christian he must be passionate
[1:05:05] about it but that's not true amen that
[1:05:08] not that's not true for sport that's not
[1:05:11] true for your Christian Life you see I
[1:05:14] realized that listening to an interview
[1:05:17] of a tennis player a French tennis
[1:05:20] player his name is Bernard tomik he came
[1:05:23] up to the 17th best player in the world
[1:05:26] only 16 ahead of him he was really good
[1:05:30] here's what he says don't play
[1:05:33] tennis do something you love and enjoy
[1:05:36] because it's a tough tough life my
[1:05:40] position I'm trapped I have to do it
[1:05:44] tennis chose me it is never something it
[1:05:48] is something I never fell in love with
[1:05:52] here's one of the greatest tennis player
[1:05:54] in the world yet he has no passion
[1:05:57] whatsoever and I have to tell you my
[1:05:59] friends tonight that it makes me think
[1:06:01] of so many message
[1:06:04] Believers especially the ones born in
[1:06:06] the church they feel exactly like
[1:06:09] that I'm
[1:06:11] trapped I have to do it the message
[1:06:15] chose
[1:06:16] me I was born in the church but I never
[1:06:20] fell in love with
[1:06:22] it there's no passion right
[1:06:26] H the message chose me I'm trapped you
[1:06:29] see brother Braham
[1:06:31] says you start out with truly Born Again
[1:06:35] Believers and then the next Generation
[1:06:37] comes along and they are no longer just
[1:06:39] plain Christians but they have taken a
[1:06:42] denominational name and that they are
[1:06:44] now Baptist methodists
[1:06:47] Etc I want to give you a little hint
[1:06:50] here each time you read the word Etc in
[1:06:52] the in the message from now on replace
[1:06:55] it with the
[1:06:57] message it works every time you see that
[1:07:02] that that way of singing the message
[1:07:05] this didn't existed when brother
[1:07:07] brandham was alive he couldn't put it
[1:07:09] that on tape and so he said Etc instead
[1:07:13] to make sure that everything that would
[1:07:14] follow and fit that category would be
[1:07:17] included you just put the message in
[1:07:19] there and it fits pretty much every
[1:07:22] time they have taken a denominational
[1:07:25] name in our in our now Baptist Methodist
[1:07:30] message that is exactly what they are
[1:07:33] too they are not Christians you have to
[1:07:36] be born of the will of God not of the
[1:07:38] will of man to be saved but these folks
[1:07:40] are coming together now by the will of
[1:07:43] men they don't say I don't say that some
[1:07:46] of them aren't right with God not for a
[1:07:48] minute do I say that but the original
[1:07:51] fire has died down they are not the same
[1:07:56] anymore the fervent desire to please God
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:01] passion passion that's the the motivator
[1:08:04] the the passion to know his his word the
[1:08:07] cry for reaching out in the spirit all
[1:08:09] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:08:12] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:08:14] God it has cooled off and that become a
[1:08:17] little bit
[1:08:19] formal passion leaves and the church
[1:08:23] becomes formal now most people most
[1:08:27] Christian can point to a place in their
[1:08:30] lives where they were passionate about
[1:08:34] their Christian
[1:08:35] lives you see in the last couple years
[1:08:38] I've talked with a lot of folks
[1:08:40] especially elders and I found out a
[1:08:43] strange pattern and that that pattern is
[1:08:47] we talk a lot a lot about the past like
[1:08:50] we used to you know we used to we used
[1:08:53] to pray all night we used used to have
[1:08:55] big fellowships in our house we used to
[1:08:58] have all night prayer meeting we used to
[1:09:00] bring new people to church quite often
[1:09:02] we used to we used to we used to past
[1:09:05] Miracles past revivals past all night
[1:09:08] prayer meetings now I'm not pointing any
[1:09:10] fingers here I don't even know you but I
[1:09:14] know one thing our enemy is the
[1:09:16] same we all fight the same
[1:09:19] enemy so I believe we're all in the same
[1:09:22] boat and if we're honest most of us can
[1:09:26] point back to a place where in our lives
[1:09:30] we were more passionate about our
[1:09:32] Christian Life that we are today right
[1:09:36] we can
[1:09:38] point and if we have less it means we
[1:09:42] lost that we lost
[1:09:44] it amen and so I studied and I really
[1:09:48] wanted to understand what made it run
[1:09:50] out and um I found out that it's Satan
[1:09:54] full time job to make sure we lose our
[1:09:59] passion you see because Revelation 3r
[1:10:01] chapter verse 15-7 says I Know Thy works
[1:10:05] that thou are neither cold nor hot H you
[1:10:09] know the rest hey and now if you drink a
[1:10:13] hot coffee you know that a hot coffee is
[1:10:17] hot about that long then it's lukewarm
[1:10:21] like hot 2° less we call it lukewarm
[1:10:25] warm and so that hot coffee it's got to
[1:10:28] be hot 2° less and we don't and we won't
[1:10:33] even drink it CU it's lukewarm and that
[1:10:36] cold coffee it's got to be cold really
[1:10:39] cold so you got this little hot here
[1:10:42] this little cold here and just about all
[1:10:45] of that in between is
[1:10:47] lukewarm and so there are different
[1:10:49] kinds of lukewarm right but if you are
[1:10:53] less hot Less on fire for God than you
[1:10:57] used to be then chances are you
[1:11:02] lukewarm now there are many reasons I
[1:11:05] found why our passion dries out and we
[1:11:08] want to look at a few of them uh we
[1:11:10] won't study them in details but I just
[1:11:12] want to put them out there so you know
[1:11:14] we can meditate on those things and for
[1:11:18] the rest of the week so let me mention
[1:11:20] some and the first one is mistakes
[1:11:24] failure Fe and mistakes you see when I
[1:11:28] became a Christian I was this defying
[1:11:31] everywhere I was doing all I could for
[1:11:34] the kingdom but then I made some
[1:11:36] mistakes and
[1:11:38] stopped when God fills you with fire
[1:11:41] when he fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:43] you just burn for God you do but Satan
[1:11:47] will make sure you make some
[1:11:49] mistakes and when you make them oh Mr
[1:11:53] critics he comes out of the closet H he
[1:11:57] comes right at you and make sure you
[1:11:59] know how bad the mistakes you made were
[1:12:03] right he does it why does he do
[1:12:07] it to put your fire down right
[1:12:12] right fire will push you to work for the
[1:12:15] kingdom but failure mistakes and critics
[1:12:18] will tune you down Satan would come and
[1:12:21] tell you you've done enough now like
[1:12:24] you've done enough mistakes
[1:12:25] just sit down and relax cool down a
[1:12:28] little and so the mistake we make they
[1:12:31] often kill our passion for the Christian
[1:12:33] life but I feel it should be the
[1:12:35] opposite because Jesus said to whom it
[1:12:38] is forgiven much shall love much and so
[1:12:43] if I make a lot of mistake but I truly
[1:12:47] believe that I am forgiven then it
[1:12:50] should spark even more love in my heart
[1:12:54] towards God and more more fire in my
[1:12:56] life that's how it should go just to
[1:13:00] know that he's gracious through it all
[1:13:02] but Satan will make sure what you feel
[1:13:04] is
[1:13:05] condemnation so that you cool down a
[1:13:08] little bit and become a bench warmer
[1:13:10] right failures and mistakes and so here
[1:13:14] is our first time out of the night did
[1:13:17] my mistakes and
[1:13:19] failures Kill My Fire for Christ
[1:13:26] did I do something I didn't forgive
[1:13:28] myself
[1:13:30] yet I stopped just sat on my
[1:13:34] chair because of my
[1:13:45] failures the pace of
[1:13:50] life let's try to get it
[1:13:58] the pace of
[1:14:00] Life man our lives are so fast right you
[1:14:04] know brother says in in the message that
[1:14:08] he says that we live in a crazy age busy
[1:14:12] doing
[1:14:13] nothing and and I often think to myself
[1:14:18] if he said it in
[1:14:20] 1960 there was there was no no cell
[1:14:25] phones in
[1:14:26] 1960 there was no internet you had to go
[1:14:29] to the mailbox to mail a
[1:14:32] letter man what would he say
[1:14:36] tonight we are often subjected to our
[1:14:38] lives instead of living it we have no
[1:14:41] time to stop we have no time to think
[1:14:44] sometimes right our lives are so fast
[1:14:46] that we can't even
[1:14:48] think and so with the kids lesson in the
[1:14:51] sports and the house and the groceries
[1:14:53] and and the work and and and and
[1:14:56] and we sometime give God what we have
[1:15:01] left and our lives they burn us
[1:15:05] out but I want to say this tonight
[1:15:10] tiredness is the result when passion
[1:15:15] leaves tiredness is the result when
[1:15:18] passion
[1:15:20] leaves you know these bikers doing that
[1:15:23] big event the tour of fr
[1:15:26] you know most of them about halfway
[1:15:29] through they start asking themselves
[1:15:32] what have I got myself
[1:15:36] into and right there they get so tired
[1:15:40] that they can't even
[1:15:41] continue because when passion leaves
[1:15:44] tiredness sets sin amen that's how it
[1:15:47] goes and so when
[1:15:50] you I mean some people can wake up at 5:
[1:15:55] and I'm one of them wake up at 5:00 to
[1:15:57] go
[1:15:59] fishing I mean the alarm clock is at 5:
[1:16:02] but at 4:30 they're
[1:16:05] up but they can't wake up at 9:00 to go
[1:16:08] to work they have to snooze at alarm
[1:16:11] clock over and over again amen why is
[1:16:13] that because they are not passionate
[1:16:16] about their work that's why the moment
[1:16:19] you start wondering why am I doing all
[1:16:23] this that question question Sparks tness
[1:16:27] you've lost passion and so here's my
[1:16:30] question for you
[1:16:33] tonight is the life we live so busy and
[1:16:37] exhausting that we've lost our passion
[1:16:41] for the Christian
[1:16:44] Life is it going so fast that all we
[1:16:48] have is 5 minutes at night or 5 minutes
[1:16:52] in the morning
[1:16:55] we've lost passion for it because we're
[1:16:58] going too
[1:17:05] fast did that sink in the moment right
[1:17:09] because we all do yes amen that's the
[1:17:12] age we live in
[1:17:16] true
[1:17:19] Idols my
[1:17:21] passions you know I believe in a
[1:17:25] Christian having a
[1:17:27] Passion I do I love
[1:17:30] fishing I really love it
[1:17:33] amen it's my
[1:17:37] passion but when your Earthly passion
[1:17:40] for
[1:17:41] whatever even good things even gardening
[1:17:45] right even painting I'm not talking
[1:17:48] about Sin now I'm talking about good
[1:17:51] things but when your Earthly passion for
[1:17:55] whatever is greater than your passion
[1:17:57] for your Christian Life your passion has
[1:18:00] become an idol in your
[1:18:04] life and for me a good way to measure
[1:18:08] it take the measure of my own life is
[1:18:12] this if I have a really bad day at work
[1:18:16] or if I'm really stressed out and I come
[1:18:19] back home and I need some relief I need
[1:18:23] some time
[1:18:25] what do I do if I need a breather do I
[1:18:29] turn the pages of this good old
[1:18:32] book and read the verses
[1:18:35] there or do I go on my phone and scroll
[1:18:39] on Facebook on YouTube or
[1:18:42] whatever right where you turn to when
[1:18:45] you need a
[1:18:48] breather there's a good chance that is
[1:18:51] an idol in your life
[1:18:55] and so there are so many sneaky ways the
[1:19:00] devil uses to dry our passion for God
[1:19:03] Amen so many sneaky ways he will use
[1:19:07] whatever passion we have that is the
[1:19:10] right passion right but he will turn it
[1:19:14] into an idol in our life something we
[1:19:16] turn to for Comfort instead of him
[1:19:21] amen and so here's my question let let
[1:19:24] time out for a
[1:19:29] moment then my passions become idols and
[1:19:32] my
[1:19:35] life think about that thing you love the
[1:19:39] most what is
[1:19:42] it is it
[1:19:45] Christ is it your
[1:19:49] Bible or is it something
[1:19:51] else you see Satan is a specialist to
[1:19:55] fill our lives with useless thing now I
[1:19:58] didn't say bad things I didn't say
[1:20:01] unlawful things Paul says all things are
[1:20:07] lawful but there are things that burn us
[1:20:10] out depression burnout anxiety that's
[1:20:13] the sickness of the
[1:20:15] century but the Christian he hasn't be
[1:20:18] he hasn't been created to burn out amen
[1:20:21] he has been created to burn up that's
[1:20:23] right
[1:20:25] so if you're feeling a little burned out
[1:20:28] tonight right now you sit in church you
[1:20:31] feel tired and burned
[1:20:34] out just
[1:20:36] know that God wants you to burn up amen
[1:20:41] take courage because tonight tonight we
[1:20:45] are here to encounter fire
[1:20:49] right we don't have to wait till
[1:20:51] tomorrow morning amen
[1:20:55] we can catch fire
[1:20:57] tonight
[1:20:59] Hallelujah last but not least the
[1:21:03] scars my heartbreaks and my
[1:21:07] scars take a family for example that
[1:21:10] loses a member to sickness to
[1:21:14] cancer and they end up saying why God
[1:21:18] why I came to church every Sunday you I
[1:21:22] was faithful we prayed about it
[1:21:27] why that
[1:21:29] heartbreak kills your
[1:21:32] passion it
[1:21:34] does that's why God wants to heal our
[1:21:38] hearts because broken hearts cannot be
[1:21:43] passionate imagine someone spiritually
[1:21:46] abused in church you know they can come
[1:21:49] to church they can and they do out of
[1:21:53] fear in fact they will do it because
[1:21:56] they're afraid of hell right someone
[1:22:00] abused spiritually is afraid of hell so
[1:22:03] they will come to church but they can't
[1:22:04] be passionate about their Christian Life
[1:22:08] someone would tell you but brother I
[1:22:10] have so many
[1:22:13] scars I have so many scars anybody here
[1:22:16] feeling that he has so many
[1:22:18] scars I do I do but I want to tell you
[1:22:23] this
[1:22:25] and I wondered at one point you know I
[1:22:27] was thinking about it when Jesus died on
[1:22:30] the
[1:22:31] cross and
[1:22:34] resurrected why wasn't he
[1:22:37] perfect like why wouldn't wouldn't you
[1:22:41] resurrect God in a perfect way without
[1:22:45] the scars without any
[1:22:48] blemish and the reason is that the scars
[1:22:52] are perfect because the are proof of a
[1:22:56] perfect power to
[1:23:00] resurrect a perfect power for healing
[1:23:04] without scars we have no
[1:23:08] proof you see the world out there they
[1:23:11] don't have
[1:23:14] scars their bruises are bleeding
[1:23:17] still because the only thing that heals
[1:23:21] right is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:24] that's the only thing that heals and he
[1:23:27] heals it completely but he leaves a scar
[1:23:31] so you can come to someone and say what
[1:23:34] you're going through that depression
[1:23:37] that suicidal thought I went through the
[1:23:39] same look at my
[1:23:41] scar there's a way
[1:23:44] out that's what the scars are
[1:23:49] for out there no scars only bleeding
[1:23:53] bruises
[1:23:55] with you know Band-Aids on it they put
[1:23:58] Band-Aids a beer drug pornography
[1:24:02] whatever they put Band-Aids on their
[1:24:06] scars but you can come to them and say
[1:24:09] look at my scars they're not bleeding
[1:24:12] anymore put your hand in my scar it's
[1:24:16] not even hurting anymore I'm
[1:24:19] Healed and when your scars are healed
[1:24:23] you are are on
[1:24:26] fire you have
[1:24:28] passion but maybe your scars aren't
[1:24:33] healed maybe your heartbreaks are still
[1:24:37] fresh and that's why you lost
[1:24:41] passion here's the
[1:24:47] question did the trials of
[1:24:50] Life get the best of my passion
[1:24:56] do these
[1:24:57] heartbreaks these battles these
[1:25:01] trials did they get the best of my
[1:25:05] passion am I stuck in that sick
[1:25:09] condition that is sickness my brother
[1:25:12] right when we say heal we always think
[1:25:15] about
[1:25:17] cancer
[1:25:20] right but he said I've come to heal heal
[1:25:24] the broken
[1:25:26] hearts that's what he
[1:25:31] said he wants to heal your heart
[1:25:34] tonight he wants to do
[1:25:37] it and if you let him do it that fire
[1:25:41] will spark inside
[1:25:44] you like you can't even
[1:25:48] imagine amen amen so what happens when
[1:25:52] you lose your passion cuz if we can all
[1:25:55] point back to a point in life where we
[1:25:58] had more
[1:26:01] passion where we were burning with fire
[1:26:03] it means that something happens when you
[1:26:06] lose passion right and so what happens
[1:26:10] is you go from
[1:26:12] Passion from Passion you go down one
[1:26:15] step into
[1:26:18] duty that's what happens if you lose
[1:26:22] passion you go from Passion to Judy oh I
[1:26:26] used to love to go to church I would get
[1:26:29] there early I couldn't wait for the
[1:26:31] doors to open to get there and oh I
[1:26:33] would read my Bible and you dwell on
[1:26:36] them verses and think about them all day
[1:26:39] and and nowadays you know I go to church
[1:26:42] once a week I know it's my duty as a as
[1:26:46] a
[1:26:47] Christian H I read my Bible once a day
[1:26:53] because brother bam said a Christian
[1:26:55] reads its Bible every
[1:26:58] day that's
[1:27:00] Judy there's no passion in there I
[1:27:04] noticed that everything we do from a
[1:27:06] Judy standpoint is really
[1:27:09] hard life is hard when you do something
[1:27:12] you don't feel like doing but you do it
[1:27:16] because you know you have to do it oh
[1:27:19] life is
[1:27:21] hard it's really hard
[1:27:25] and so if you ever have a hard time
[1:27:28] getting out of bed next Sunday to come
[1:27:31] to
[1:27:32] church please be honest with
[1:27:36] yourself and realize that you've lost
[1:27:40] passion that it has become a duty to
[1:27:43] come to church on
[1:27:45] Sunday it
[1:27:47] has but now you know do something hard
[1:27:50] for a long period of time you know some
[1:27:52] of the brothers they go work in a shop
[1:27:55] or somewhere and they do their time like
[1:27:57] they count the days till they retire
[1:28:01] that's what they do man that's hard
[1:28:03] waking up each morning to go do your
[1:28:05] time without passion
[1:28:08] whatsoever but do it long
[1:28:10] enough and it gets
[1:28:14] easier am it gets
[1:28:18] easier but that's not good news right
[1:28:22] because what happens is when when you
[1:28:24] operate out of Judy long enough right
[1:28:27] Judy is here you go down one more step
[1:28:32] into tradition right that's right right
[1:28:37] it gets
[1:28:38] easier because you're getting used to it
[1:28:41] it becomes an Abit it becomes a
[1:28:45] tradition and that's not good
[1:28:50] news that really isn't
[1:28:56] all
[1:28:57] right that's not good
[1:29:00] news you know
[1:29:03] why because your faith is
[1:29:06] bound by your tradition right that's
[1:29:09] what the prophet says he
[1:29:19] says give your fate a
[1:29:22] chance turn it loose unbridle it let it
[1:29:26] work you've got it all bound down with
[1:29:31] Traditions turn it loose cut it Loose
[1:29:35] you see when you come to
[1:29:36] church by
[1:29:38] tradition your Fai is
[1:29:41] bound and that is why you can be in
[1:29:45] church for 30
[1:29:46] years be a look like a faithful you know
[1:29:50] attendee a faithful Christian and all
[1:29:53] that and come forward and ask for prayer
[1:29:56] for healing or anything and it seems you
[1:29:59] can't receive a thing from God it is
[1:30:02] because you come by tradition
[1:30:08] right
[1:30:10] now in church when you speak that kind
[1:30:14] of
[1:30:15] message people think oh it's really good
[1:30:17] for Brother John do it's really good for
[1:30:19] amen for sister so and so right right
[1:30:23] that's the way we approach it but we
[1:30:26] can't do that with this stopping and I
[1:30:28] want to prove you tonight that out of
[1:30:30] three people in the church doing the
[1:30:32] exact same thing right they can be
[1:30:35] operating out of three different
[1:30:38] motivations right right we sing and we
[1:30:41] lift up our hands and one person just
[1:30:45] lift up holy hands out of love and and
[1:30:49] out of passion and the person sting
[1:30:52] sitting next to that lady that that
[1:30:55] sister is doing it you know because she
[1:30:58] wants she really wants to be a good
[1:31:02] Christian she really wants to honor God
[1:31:05] and and she knows she should lift our
[1:31:07] hands and that is Duty that's not out of
[1:31:11] love that's out of Duty and then there's
[1:31:14] that third sister you know she's been
[1:31:17] coming to church for 30 years some
[1:31:20] services are better than the other you
[1:31:21] know oh I like when this sing my
[1:31:24] favorite song they haven't sang it in a
[1:31:26] long
[1:31:27] time she comes out of tradition and you
[1:31:31] know she's caught up in the
[1:31:33] moment and she sings with her lips and
[1:31:36] her arms
[1:31:38] raised but when you look at it from the
[1:31:41] outside they're doing the exact same
[1:31:45] thing that's why you have to take that
[1:31:47] mirror for yourself and look inside your
[1:31:51] heart to see
[1:31:54] to see which one of these three powers
[1:31:58] you are motivated by in your Christian
[1:32:01] walk and so let me give different names
[1:32:04] to these three powers why uh when they
[1:32:07] are related to religion right because we
[1:32:09] use them at work in sports we use these
[1:32:13] three powers everywhere but when related
[1:32:16] to religion I've named them you know
[1:32:19] passion I called it through
[1:32:22] Christianity I told you earlier I
[1:32:24] believe there's only one way to serve
[1:32:27] God and it's to be passionate about our
[1:32:30] Christian lives you
[1:32:33] see passion true Christianity is a
[1:32:37] personal relationship with Christ so the
[1:32:39] person motivated by Passion is just
[1:32:42] simply in love with his maker right and
[1:32:46] he's on fire and that Christian doesn't
[1:32:49] care what you think he's going to lift
[1:32:52] his hands anyhow amen
[1:32:54] it's something between him and God but
[1:32:59] then when passion leaves you find
[1:33:01] yourself falling into the performance
[1:33:05] gospel and the person in that category
[1:33:08] tries to do enough to go to
[1:33:12] heaven if you look inside you might have
[1:33:15] to admit that to yourself it's not
[1:33:18] something we consciously
[1:33:20] do but you kind of have to go to church
[1:33:23] right because you're Christian and so
[1:33:25] you want to be a good Christian let me
[1:33:28] tell you something there's no such a
[1:33:29] thing as a good Christian amen you're
[1:33:33] either a Christian or you're not a
[1:33:35] Christian Christian means like Christ
[1:33:39] that's what it
[1:33:42] means and so sometimes you do it without
[1:33:44] even realizing it but you start doing
[1:33:48] things out of Duty right I because you
[1:33:53] want you want to go to heaven or you you
[1:33:55] fear going to hell or you want to be
[1:33:58] good enough right it's a work-based
[1:34:03] Salvation you see it's a duty for a man
[1:34:07] to provide for his
[1:34:09] family and that's why you got to perform
[1:34:12] at
[1:34:13] work when it's related to duty it's
[1:34:16] related to
[1:34:17] performing you got to better your
[1:34:19] situation you got to win at the game of
[1:34:21] life so your bus comes and r RWS your
[1:34:24] work and says well done buddy here's a
[1:34:27] raise two bucks an hour you see it's
[1:34:31] your duty to provide so you got to
[1:34:35] perform and you find the same attitude
[1:34:37] in church from those who live according
[1:34:40] to the performance gospel they have to
[1:34:44] perform in
[1:34:45] church they have to have an office they
[1:34:48] have to do something they have to clap
[1:34:50] louder whatever it it represents for
[1:34:52] them but they feel like they have to do
[1:34:57] something and then you will find you
[1:35:01] know in a typical church and I'm sure
[1:35:04] there's none of them here
[1:35:07] tonight but you find in a typical church
[1:35:10] people in love I mean in love with their
[1:35:14] Traditions right and I call them
[1:35:17] Pharisees I don't mean to offend anyone
[1:35:20] but this is a Pharisee spirit it's true
[1:35:24] these people they are looking for
[1:35:26] respect and honor yes sir and they care
[1:35:30] about their traditions in fact they love
[1:35:33] them and that's why they fall under the
[1:35:35] category of appearance
[1:35:39] gospel the appearance the honor and the
[1:35:42] respect and the way things look right
[1:35:47] Matthew chapter 15 and G and then came
[1:35:50] to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which
[1:35:52] were of Jerusalem saying why do thy
[1:35:54] disciples transgress the tradition of
[1:35:57] the elders for they wash not their hands
[1:36:01] when they eat bread but Jesus answered
[1:36:04] unto them why do ye transgress the
[1:36:07] Commandments of God by your
[1:36:11] Traditions right and
[1:36:13] so Jesus fired right back he said your
[1:36:18] Traditions are what transgressed my
[1:36:22] Commandments and and you know Pharisees
[1:36:25] they want people to follow the tradition
[1:36:27] so what they do is they put heavy burden
[1:36:30] on people this is what they do on their
[1:36:34] fellow church members they put heavy
[1:36:37] burden Matthews Chapter 23 verse4 for
[1:36:41] they bind heavy burden Jesus speaking
[1:36:43] for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous
[1:36:47] to be born and lay them on man's
[1:36:51] shoulder this is what they do in a
[1:36:53] Church they put heavy burden on their
[1:36:57] fellow brothers and sisters and then
[1:36:59] verse 5 says but all their work they do
[1:37:05] to be seen of men there goes your
[1:37:08] appearance
[1:37:09] gospel why do they do it it's not even
[1:37:13] now it's not even about you know being
[1:37:16] good enough to go in heaven no it's
[1:37:19] about look at me I'm the best Christian
[1:37:22] in the house
[1:37:24] that's what it's
[1:37:25] about and so one is motivated by
[1:37:31] love that's true
[1:37:33] Christianity one is motivated by
[1:37:38] fear that's Judy gospel fear of missing
[1:37:42] out fear of not being good enough and
[1:37:45] one is motivated by Pride
[1:37:53] help us Lord and every time you see
[1:37:57] someone looking to put a heavy burden on
[1:38:00] someone else the sad thing is you also
[1:38:03] find someone who's willing to take on
[1:38:06] the burden and try to perform and do it
[1:38:09] well as a duty because they want to be
[1:38:11] good enough and they want to make it in
[1:38:13] the Rapture and they want to be as good
[1:38:17] as the
[1:38:20] Pharisees and these guys are perfect
[1:38:23] right read your Bible they would respect
[1:38:26] every Iota everything and so that person
[1:38:30] falling under the fear category it has
[1:38:33] to live up to the Pharisees expectation
[1:38:36] this appearance gospel so each time you
[1:38:39] find a Pharisee trying to put down a
[1:38:41] heavy burden on someone you sadly find
[1:38:44] someone ready to take on that burden and
[1:38:46] do it the best they can to be good
[1:38:49] enough because they want to make the
[1:38:52] Rapture h
[1:38:56] and the reason this is so bad is it all
[1:38:59] comes down to what you put on your altar
[1:39:04] that's right and I've been thinking
[1:39:06] about it all week this
[1:39:09] week you see Behavior manage
[1:39:14] management managing behavior is what
[1:39:17] Pharisees do they put you in a
[1:39:21] system where we control
[1:39:23] what you do what you can do when you do
[1:39:27] it and how you can do it we just control
[1:39:30] your behavior to make you look like a
[1:39:35] Christian and I've been meditating a lot
[1:39:38] this week about the way they worshiped
[1:39:40] in the altar the way it was done in the
[1:39:42] Old Testament you know and in the Old
[1:39:45] Testament what's astonishing is that
[1:39:47] when your offering was accepted by God
[1:39:52] God would send fire to burn that
[1:39:56] offering you knew right away if your
[1:39:59] offering was accepted or not God sent
[1:40:03] his fire as as a sign of respect and
[1:40:07] approval of your offering
[1:40:10] right this is how you knew God accepted
[1:40:14] it am and and often in our churches we
[1:40:19] find ourselves out of fire it seems
[1:40:24] we're there we sing we clap you know we
[1:40:28] we shout amen yet it seems like we're
[1:40:32] burned
[1:40:33] out it seems like we're you know tired
[1:40:36] it seems like we're we're in a state of
[1:40:39] depression or
[1:40:42] anxiety but the question I have to ask
[1:40:45] tonight is when you
[1:40:48] Worship in
[1:40:50] church what is on your Alt
[1:40:55] alter we want
[1:40:59] fire we want
[1:41:01] fire God wants to send his fire the
[1:41:04] prophet said he wants to send his holy
[1:41:06] ghost in the church more than the church
[1:41:09] wants to receive
[1:41:10] it so it's not on
[1:41:13] him it's on us but if we got three
[1:41:17] gospels true Christianity performance
[1:41:20] and appearance gospel then it means that
[1:41:22] we got three three different
[1:41:24] sacrifices on the
[1:41:28] altar we got the sacrifice of self-
[1:41:31] Pride
[1:41:36] self-righteousness we we put our
[1:41:38] behaviors on the altar often like if I
[1:41:42] had a good week and I was a good
[1:41:44] Christian and I prayed and I read my
[1:41:46] Bible and stuff I come to church and I
[1:41:48] feel like I can
[1:41:51] worship brother you putting your good
[1:41:53] behavior on the
[1:41:55] altar no wonder there's no fire coming
[1:41:58] down amen this is filthy rags for this
[1:42:02] is what it is right stop putting be your
[1:42:05] good behavior on the altar we have a
[1:42:08] perfect lamb for the altar we do and if
[1:42:12] you come empty-handed with an with the
[1:42:15] perfect Lamb on the altar the fire comes
[1:42:19] down every time Hallelujah we don't even
[1:42:22] have to inspect the lamb we don't even
[1:42:24] have to kill the lamb we don't even even
[1:42:26] have to do nothing
[1:42:28] except place that lamb on our altar of
[1:42:35] worship and fire comes down every
[1:42:39] time but you're there in church and you
[1:42:42] you sing a special so that everybody
[1:42:45] looks at you or or you you lift your
[1:42:48] your hands and you clap because you you
[1:42:50] need to do it in order to be good enough
[1:42:53] Christian and you wonder why you do all
[1:42:56] that and I still burn out and have no
[1:43:02] fire because God doesn't accept your
[1:43:06] worship he doesn't accept your
[1:43:10] sacrifice it's filthy rags for
[1:43:14] him he provided
[1:43:17] himself a perfect
[1:43:19] sacrifice brother on your worst day
[1:43:23] right you are a
[1:43:26] Christian you don't have to wait till
[1:43:28] you're good enough to come to the
[1:43:32] altar you have to come knowing you're
[1:43:35] nothing but the sacrifice is what is
[1:43:41] perfect even in the Old Testament they
[1:43:43] never inspected The Sinner they always
[1:43:46] inspected the
[1:43:48] lamb we need to stop stop trying to
[1:43:52] manage our behaviors and put something
[1:43:54] we're not on the
[1:43:56] altar you're nothing I'm nothing Paul
[1:43:59] said when I tried to
[1:44:01] good bad comes out that's what happens
[1:44:06] welcome to the club am amen but when I
[1:44:09] come to church I come knowing I'm
[1:44:12] nothing but I accept a perfect sacrifice
[1:44:16] I place that sacrifice on my Altar and
[1:44:19] then fire comes
[1:44:21] down and when I get out of church I
[1:44:24] don't I'm not burn burnout anymore I
[1:44:28] come out
[1:44:29] burning with fire
[1:44:32] amen hallelujah so here's my
[1:44:37] question which gospel is
[1:44:42] yours something drove you here
[1:44:49] tonight something
[1:44:51] did what is
[1:44:56] it did you have to
[1:45:02] come do we have to go to
[1:45:08] church do we have to dress the way we
[1:45:11] dress is that a Salvation
[1:45:15] issue do we have to sing do we have to
[1:45:20] clap what about it
[1:45:27] a lot of wom wearing dress will go to
[1:45:32] hell can I take it one step further yes
[1:45:37] a lot of women wearing Pence will be in
[1:45:47] heaven if you do it because you want to
[1:45:49] be good
[1:45:51] enough sister you should wear
[1:45:55] Pence but if you're married to Jesus
[1:45:57] Christ and you're so in love with your
[1:46:01] husband that you want to please him and
[1:46:04] you want to look beautiful for
[1:46:08] him that's worth all the gold there is
[1:46:10] in the world
[1:46:13] Amen but as soon as you step you know in
[1:46:17] the you get in the church there is Mr
[1:46:21] Pharisee he's the first one want to get
[1:46:23] to you before Christ does
[1:46:26] sometimes and he's there with his book
[1:46:29] of
[1:46:30] compliance and he wants you to comply to
[1:46:33] a whole bunch of
[1:46:35] rules and I mean you want to go to
[1:46:37] heaven right you want to be a Christian
[1:46:40] you wouldn't cross these doors if it
[1:46:42] wasn't
[1:46:43] so and so you start putting your works
[1:46:46] on your
[1:46:48] altar stop it yes amen come at you
[1:46:53] are
[1:46:55] amen now my time is
[1:46:59] out I want to speak to the young people
[1:47:02] I want to speak to the young people I
[1:47:05] was born in a mage church and so we
[1:47:09] we've been saying you know passion Judy
[1:47:13] tradition when when in fact you know if
[1:47:19] you're born in a miss church it's
[1:47:21] actually the opposite
[1:47:23] because when you are
[1:47:27] young you have no choice even like your
[1:47:30] parents go so you go and you know maybe
[1:47:34] there's Sunday school maybe we give you
[1:47:36] chocolate that when it's Easter whatever
[1:47:39] a gift a Christmas you you do drawings
[1:47:42] and stuff and it's just a tradition on
[1:47:44] Sunday we go to church but then when
[1:47:47] you're
[1:47:49] 16 you get your own car
[1:47:52] and so you get to make your own
[1:47:54] decisions kind
[1:47:55] of you had to go before it was just a
[1:47:59] tradition but now you have a choice will
[1:48:02] you go to church or will you stay
[1:48:06] home right and so it becomes a duty to
[1:48:10] go you know you should go and so you try
[1:48:14] to wake up on Sunday morning and and you
[1:48:17] try to be there before the song service
[1:48:19] ends you
[1:48:21] know because it's a
[1:48:23] duty you have to do it at least once
[1:48:26] every two weeks or something it's a
[1:48:30] duty but you need to meet God face to
[1:48:33] face amen man that life is hard buddy
[1:48:37] don't stay in that Duty Zone this is
[1:48:42] hard meet Christ face to
[1:48:47] face right that'll make come into church
[1:48:51] amazing right incredible
[1:48:55] amen now I went hard on Judy the past
[1:49:00] half hour or so and I can almost hear
[1:49:03] some of you say I thought you know we
[1:49:05] Christians had
[1:49:09] judies is the brother saying we don't
[1:49:11] have duties as Christians you know when
[1:49:14] I spoke about that topic to my wife she
[1:49:17] said it's a good thing to have a sense
[1:49:19] of
[1:49:20] Duty is it true
[1:49:24] here am I like going against
[1:49:27] Judy yet it
[1:49:29] seems that we have judies I searched
[1:49:33] post of Judy you know in the message and
[1:49:36] 132 quotes came up
[1:49:40] 132 and so there's something about Judy
[1:49:44] I just want to read one quick you
[1:49:49] see I thought it would be a blessing for
[1:49:51] you and you people who have little
[1:49:55] churches here who's struggling my advice
[1:49:59] would be for you to stand at your post
[1:50:02] of Duty just as loyal as you can to the
[1:50:05] cause of Christ and back up your
[1:50:08] minister and everything that's going on
[1:50:10] for the cause of Christ and do that and
[1:50:13] God will bless you amen that's
[1:50:17] good
[1:50:19] so we need a balance right amen and so
[1:50:23] we've talked about passion disregarding
[1:50:25] Judy but let's go back to the first
[1:50:28] verse we we read which was first
[1:50:30] Corinthians chapter 9 but let's start a
[1:50:33] little bit um ahead to verse 16 instead
[1:50:38] of verse 24 to get a little bit more of
[1:50:41] more context about what Paul is
[1:50:43] addressing here so let's start at verse
[1:50:46] 16
[1:50:48] together Paul
[1:50:51] says for though I preach the
[1:50:55] gospel I have nothing to Glory
[1:50:59] of for the necessity is laid upon me yes
[1:51:03] a woe unto me if I preach not the gospel
[1:51:08] now if this is not Judy I don't know
[1:51:11] what it
[1:51:12] is this is straight up Judy right it is
[1:51:17] but then he goes on verse 17 for if I do
[1:51:20] this thing willingly
[1:51:23] I have a
[1:51:26] reward you'd rather do it with
[1:51:29] passion that's where the reward
[1:51:33] lays but if against my will a
[1:51:35] dispensation of the Gospel is committed
[1:51:37] unto me what is my reward then verily
[1:51:41] that when I preach the gospel I may make
[1:51:43] the gospel of Christ without charge that
[1:51:45] I abuse not my power in the gospel for
[1:51:48] though I be free from all men yet I have
[1:51:53] made myself servant unto all that I
[1:51:56] might gain the
[1:51:58] more listen to that carefully right how
[1:52:01] he's acting about preaching the gospel
[1:52:03] For unto the Jew I became as a Jew that
[1:52:06] I might gain the Jew to them that are
[1:52:09] under the law as under the law that I
[1:52:10] might gain them that are under the law
[1:52:12] to them that are without law as without
[1:52:14] law being not without the law of God but
[1:52:17] under the law to Christ that I might
[1:52:19] gain them that are without law to the
[1:52:23] weak I became became I as weak that I
[1:52:25] might gain the weak I am made all things
[1:52:29] to all men that I might by all means
[1:52:33] save
[1:52:35] some that is not JY brother right amen
[1:52:40] that is not
[1:52:41] dudy if
[1:52:43] Paul did accomplish his duty without
[1:52:48] passion he could have stand on a on a
[1:52:50] corner of the Street on Sunday morning
[1:52:52] for an hour and kind of preach the
[1:52:55] gospel you know it's my duty I have to
[1:52:58] do it so let me take you know an hour a
[1:53:02] week and preach the gospel but he starts
[1:53:06] by saying it's a duty but then he shows
[1:53:09] us how he goes about this Duty he does
[1:53:12] it with
[1:53:13] passion to the weak as weak to the Jews
[1:53:17] as
[1:53:18] Jews he he says I am made all all things
[1:53:23] to all men that I might by all means
[1:53:26] save some and I do
[1:53:29] this for the gospel's sake that I might
[1:53:33] be partaker thereof with you know ye not
[1:53:38] that they which run in the race run all
[1:53:42] but one receiveth the price you see
[1:53:45] there we're
[1:53:46] back he shows us how he is going about
[1:53:51] his duty with passion amen he said my
[1:53:54] duty is to run but my passion drives me
[1:53:58] to sacrifice and to run like someone who
[1:54:01] wants to win the
[1:54:03] prize he could just run you know he
[1:54:06] could just fight like someone who beats
[1:54:07] the air but that's not what he
[1:54:12] does so run that ye may obtain and every
[1:54:15] man that St striveth for the Mastery is
[1:54:18] temperate in all things now they do it
[1:54:20] to obtain a corruptible crown but we and
[1:54:23] Incorruptible therefore I therefore so
[1:54:26] run not has uncertainly so fight I not
[1:54:30] as one that Beth the air but I keep my
[1:54:33] body and bring it unto subjection lest
[1:54:37] that by any means when I have preached
[1:54:39] to others I myself should be a Cast
[1:54:45] Away now let me end with this quot baham
[1:54:49] says that's the only way you can do the
[1:54:53] right kind of a job for the Lord is put
[1:54:56] everything you got right to the for
[1:54:59] Forefront for Christ all your strength
[1:55:02] all your soul all your heart all your
[1:55:04] mind everything that you've got when

[1:55:57] whatsoever you do do it hardly as to the
[1:56:00] Lord and not unto men and the only way
[1:56:04] to do what the scripture tells
[1:56:06] us is
[1:56:08] fire that is the only way we need our
[1:56:11] hearts set on fire we need our fire in
[1:56:15] our souls you know when Moses met fire

[2:06:02] amen did you hear from your theophany
[2:06:07] tonight we came we asked to hear from
[2:06:10] God and I believe we did we heard
[2:06:13] directly from the throne this wasn't
[2:06:14] just of a
[2:06:16] man you know there's a lot of things
[2:06:19] that I heard tonight that we all heard
[2:06:22] tonight and I just think there's one
[2:06:24] thing that I heard that just stands out
[2:06:26] above it all to me and it's simply this
[2:06:30] is that Christians are not designed
[2:06:32] Christians are not intended they're not
[2:06:35] made to burn out yes come on they're
[2:06:38] made to burn
[2:06:40] up hallu and if we're burning out
[2:06:44] something's
[2:06:45] wrong and I think we heard loud and
[2:06:47] clear if we're burning out we need to
[2:06:49] take a look at what's on our altar right
[2:06:52] because he provided one
[2:06:54] sacrifice and that was enough for every
[2:06:56] single man every single time every
[2:06:59] single
[2:07:01] place I think it's just
[2:07:04] amazing God bless you brother thank you
[2:07:06] for your service
[2:07:09] tonight I I I don't know I so many
[2:07:12] points tonight please uh remember the
[2:07:14] prayer meeting tomorrow night at 7:30 at
[2:07:17] the
[2:07:18] church we uh I I I I I think this is one
[2:07:22] of those Services where I'll go back and
[2:07:23] listen again and again so many points in
[2:07:26] there so many nuggets that we can take
[2:07:28] and and use in our
[2:07:32] lives it all comes down to our altar
[2:07:34] though what's on our altar my my my
[2:07:39] my can we just sing that song Lord
[2:07:43] You're
[2:07:44] Beautiful as we close tonight maybe we
[2:07:47] could just bow in
[2:07:49] prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[2:07:51] Jesus tonight we're so thankful for the
[2:07:53] word that you gave to us
[2:07:56] father and Lord we know that many times
[2:07:59] we fail in our lives and father we come
[2:08:02] from different walks and different
[2:08:04] backgrounds and different things but
[2:08:06] Lord Jesus I pray that tonight if
[2:08:09] anything has ever altered our ability to
[2:08:12] walk with you that father you would
[2:08:14] forgive us for it and that Lord Jesus
[2:08:17] maybe if we're not even aware of it that
[2:08:19] Lord you would bring it to our
[2:08:20] remembrance and that we could quickly
[2:08:22] make it
[2:08:23] right we know that you have provided a
[2:08:26] way for us and father there's only one
[2:08:28] provided way in this age and that's
[2:08:30] truly with you and father tonight I
[2:08:33] believe that's the desire of every
[2:08:35] single Christian is to take you by the
[2:08:38] hand Lord to have you take us by the
[2:08:40] hand and to have that intimate
[2:08:42] relationship where you can live out
[2:08:44] through US Lord Jesus where your fire is
[2:08:47] present in our lives father we thank you
[2:08:50] for the word tonight we pray that that
[2:08:51] you would be with brother Joel and his
[2:08:53] family Lord Jesus we pray that you would
[2:08:56] watch over the open door Tabernacle in
[2:08:58] Three Rivers Quebec Lord Jesus that you
[2:09:01] would continue to watch over that work
[2:09:03] Lord that you would give him a continual
[2:09:06] Revival in his life Lord and in his
[2:09:09] church father we pray that you would
[2:09:11] Grant him traveling mercies and when he
[2:09:13] goes home father that he would have a
[2:09:15] spring in his step Lord because he knows
[2:09:18] that he was encouraging to your people
[2:09:21] we love you we thank you we ask that you
[2:09:23] would just keep your hand upon each one
[2:09:25] of us now as we go our separate ways
