[0:01] [Music]
[0:08] I want to sing the song it's titled one
[0:11] dead soldier
[0:12] we know along the way many times as
[0:14] Christians we have scars
[0:17] but the important thing and the
[0:19] interesting thing is a god there's no
[0:21] throw throw us away because of our scars
[0:23] it brings us closer to him and he heals
[0:26] us heals our wounds
[0:28] may you be blessed by the lyrics and the
[0:31] the song this morning
[0:32] Jesus name
[0:34] [Music]
[0:48] Lord my battles cause I'm ready
[0:51] and my medals Must Be Few
[0:55] following the midst of conflict raging
[0:59] so often I failed you
[1:03] but somehow you've kept me standing
[1:07] pick me up each time I'd fall you don't
[1:11] cast down wound soldiers you just love
[1:15] them through it all
[1:20] one day all the soldiers will go home
[1:26] we'll cease fighting for the battle
[1:30] we'll be worn
[1:34] as the captain says well done you fought
[1:38] the fight the race is run wounded
[1:42] soldiers
[1:44] [Music]
[1:47] welcome home
[1:55] in my heart I am a Victor
[1:59] yet at times the flash is weak
[2:03] and so often I have begged Your Grace
[2:06] lest I go down and defeat is then I
[2:11] recall that battle that was fought by
[2:15] you alone
[2:17] as your blood ran from that rocket cross
[2:21] our victories
[2:26] one day all the soldiers will go home
[2:32] we'll See's fighting for the battle will
[2:37] be won
[2:40] as the captain says well done you fought
[2:44] the fight the race is wrong wounded
[2:48] soldier
[2:50] the war is over
[2:53] will come home
[2:58] one day out the soldiers Will Go On
[3:04] we'll See's fighting for the battle will
[3:09] be
[3:12] as the captain says well done
[3:16] well to fight the race is wrong
[3:20] wounded soldier
[3:24] the world is over
[3:27] [Music]
[3:37] [Applause]
