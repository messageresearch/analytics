in a blistering cold evening certainly warm in here praise the Lord richly bless you all you have a need tonight maybe just make it known by the way of an uplift hand we have a few prayer requests tonight we would like to bring before the church Before the Throne um one is a praise report for brother Pete Clawson who is improving in condition he was moved from the hospital as I understand to more of a rehabilitation Ward which is a tremendous thing for a man at his age certainly want to thank the Lord for that we want to remember Sister Crystal clawen who is diagnosed with covid and uh that the family won't get it that it will just uh I guess be contained uh we'd like to remember Brennan mcgilvery who was an employee of brother Paul and sister Elaine in their company needs a touch from the Lord we want to remember Jerry Carpenter brother Jerry and Sister Mary Carpenter but the Jerry was diagnosed from the dentist to that he needs plate and and pins in his jaw because he had an x-ray and his jaw is cracked and the dentist said that it will uh it will be a nuisance for him for the rest of his life if he doesn't have this operation and he and his wife don't want the operation they want to walk by faith and trust that the Lord will touch them and uh I honestly said to them I think you know God uses doctors I wouldn't shy away from that necessarily but you have to go by your faith the level of faith that God has given you and uh they just told me a testimony and I thought it was so good sister Mary said she got up in the night and uh somehow one of her hair pins dropped on the floor in the middle of the night brother Jerry without a hearing Aiden heard it hit the floor so I said brother brother Jerry actually heard a pin drop you know what the Lord can move in uh any way he wants and I believe believe he's just looking for us to trust him I'd also like to bring Before the Throne tonight my nephew Zach nadak he was diagnosed with a broken arm he had a broken arm for a couple of days and uh a sore arm for a couple of days and went to the hospital and was diagnosed with a broken arm and apparently the medication that he takes for the uh muscular distrophy that he suffers uh is causing osteoporosis and so some how one of the caregivers putting on his coat or his shirt or something Mis maneuvered his arm and broke it so his parents are uh really uh desperately trying to seek Direction and Leadership for what they should do and and how to go forwards with this because who knows what to do if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto the Lord with an uplift hand as we go to him gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we're so thankful that we can come to your throne Lord there's nowhere else that we would ever want to go there's nowhere else that we could go father and tonight we bring all of our needs unto you Lord Jesus as you've instructed and Lord we just want to thank you for touching brother Pete Clawson we know he's been a faithful servant all of his life from the moment that you revealed yourself to him Lord and through him he's lived according to the light that you have shown him and father we're so thankful that you've touched him Lord that you've answered the prayers of the family and you continue to do so Lord father we pray that you would just continue to touch our brother Lord that you would give him strength father that you would give him Lord Jesus encouragement for the journey and Lord we just ask that you would use his situation to continue revealing yourself to the family as well Lord father that it wouldn't just be oh that someone has passed away but father that the family would consider the very location of their souls Lord as Adam considered when he heard your voice say Adam Where Art Thou father that the family would desire to know where they stand with you as well father we know that you work in many many ways in many levels for the same situation Lord and we just trust you in this one father we just pray that you would continue to pour yourself out through brother Pete claw and Lord Jesus and father tonight we just want to remember brother Jerry Carpenter Lord and the need that he has in his life Lord father whether to get an operation or Lord to just walk by faith and trust that you will heal him Lord we know that you are more than able father and that you are already working through him Lord that he has been healed miraculously already from that fall even the doctor's testimony is that it's miraculous because of this speedy recovery father if you could Lord we pray that you would just touch brother Jerry and just touch his jaw father and heal it make him whole that father when he would have the next x-ray that the doctors would say what happened because it's fixed we know that you're able Lord and we just trust you that way and father we look forward to the time we could see the Carpenters here again in service with us Lord father we just want to remember Sister CLA Sister Crystal clawen Lord with the co diagnosis Lord and we know that's what the scientific World calls it but father we know that there's nothing too great for you and father we just want to rebuke that Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ and father we trust that you will just come on the scene and help her back to health again father that she would have a swift recovery and that her family would be safe Lord father that you would just strengthen and encourage everyone in their home Lord father tonight we just want to Lord thank you for the opportunity to bring Brennan mcgilvery to your throne Lord Jesus you know the circumstances you know the situation father and Lord God we pray that you would just make yourself real to this gentleman that he would come to know you in the power of your Resurrection father Lord that he wouldn't just know some some God the the god of his employers but Lord he would come to know you as his God lord Jesus father we pray that you would just help the situation Lord work out for your glory and we'll be careful to give you the praise now father we just want to bring another request to you Lord my nephew Zach nadak Lord you know the family you know the circumstances Lord you know his grandma has muscular distrophy and we know it's a devil his mother has muscular disty and we know it's a devil and we know that that devil has gone into that baby boy from birth Lord as a devil that we've called muscular distrophy and father we just want to stand together as a body of Believers and just rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ in my mom in my sister and in her son father we know that we shouldn't have to contend with devils and Lord many times we we think about the the times that you answer a prayer and it's so surprising oh Father help us to to be surprised when you don't answer father we pray that you would just come on the scene and and move on the scene Lord give give Kelly and and Brad Direction Lord and Leadership and how they should move forward Lord and we pray that you would just bring Comfort to Zach Lord oh Father we know that he's dependent on that right arm and and he can't even use it now so father he's just completely incapacitated outside of a touch from you father we love you and we thank you tonight and we pray that you would just meet each and every prayer request made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand father we know that your arm is not too short and that your will is that we would come unto you with all of our burdens Lord Jesus because you want to give us rest father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy tonight we pray that you would just pour yourself out tonight in this Spirit Lord father that Lord your children's efforts wouldn't be in vain for traveling here tonight across this city in the cold Lord father that you would just give us traveling mercies as well when we go back home again but we would say truly that we have heard from you once again Lord we love you and we thank you and we just commit all this service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Revelations chapter 1 once again just a couple of announcements while we turn to Revelations 1 verse 1 there's a prayer meeting scheduled for tomorrow night but if it's going to be blistering cold I don't really want to put the pressure on to have everyone come out so we'll just play it by ear if that's okay I don't want to cancel it I want to postpone it if it's really cold so potentially for next week which would be the 11th um if it's really cold tomorrow night we'll uh we'll just bump it a week I hope that's okay with everyone um on Sunday I actually will be traveling to Lethbridge with brother mvin to go and meet the Saints down there and brother Toby has agreed to take the service here so on Sunday I will not be here I'll be in Lethbridge but uh we just trust the Lord will continue to move and uh you know I'm I'm real excited to see what's happening in Lethbridge there's a couple new families that are attending now and uh I just wonder I I have to wonder how many more people are there in the City of Lethbridge that would desire to hear this word and then how many people are there in Medicine Hat that would desire to hear this word and how many are there in Red Deer and how many more are there in Calgary that already know about this word but just maybe don't Fellowship for whatever reason or or maybe they don't know that there's a a a church here we don't know I think it's just wonderful to see what the Lord's doing so if you can just pray with us pray for us uh as we travel and that the Lord will continue to move in the hearts of the Saints in Lethbridge Revelations 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep the those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you have saved us Lord that you died for us and that you washed us in your own blood father tonight as we go forwards in this study we pray that you would just continue to break it open to us fresh Lord Jesus that Lord this would become a new book to us father that it would Lord just reveal so many new things to us we just commit all the words that are spoken now the rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated tonight I just would like to uh start with page 29 in the exposition of the seven Church ages and and the heading is loosed from sin it's a new uh not a chapter but just a a heading a subheading a sub chapter maybe um hopefully we'll get through this section and get on to chapter two tonight Lord willing um but I would like to take from the very first part of this is Revelations 1:5 and it's the last part of this verse unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood I think that's just so beautiful we could preach a whole sermon on that that sentence right there because we know that he's done it all he's the one that saved us and he's the one that washed Us in his own blood there's nothing that we could ever do except for accepted and boy once we accept it when we truly accept it when it's not just lip service when it actually makes that longest journey from the intellectual understanding that 18 inches or 14 inches whatever it is from the mind down into the heart where that special place is that God created for himself in the heart of the human being that teeny little spot that he created the throne room of his life his existence in us when that happens brothers and sisters we know it something happens to us we are not the same person that we used to be I just I want to read the last paragraph uh paragraph 116 in the red uh Church age book it says may God begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing revelation we spoke about it last time how important it is when when the preaching of the word is happening when when we're listening maybe when we're just fellowshipping you can be having conversation but all of a sudden fireworks start going off in your mind because of the words that are being spoken and you're you're fellowshipping back and forth about the word of God and that's that's prevailing Revelation it's taking over our minds and in our hearts it's opening the word to us and you know there's many types of Revelation but we only want revelation by the spirit and how will we know if we're talking about Revelation by the spirit in our own lives we can take it right back to the word of God the prophet and the bride and the word will all be saying the same thing the spirit and the bride will say exactly the same words I just love this this this sentence in this verse of revelations: 15 unto him that loosed us and washed us from our sins in his own blood our sins in his own blood you know I I just think that we could just just have have a a praise service right here just based on that one sentence because we know there's nothing that we could ever do and we're going to get right into that here um I just need to get into it and stop trying to preach you know we're just going to teach this so forgive me I just get excited by it I'll save the excitement for Sunday Lord willing paragraph 117 the word washed brother bradam in this uh book the exposition of the seven Church ages is actually loosed where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty right is actually loose loosed us from our sins in his own blood isn't that wonderful but are you spiritually minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sin sin it was not human blood wait a second it wasn't human blood it was the blood of God how can you dispute this now I know why there's people that say well this book isn't really you know maybe somebody put something in there that maybe shouldn't have been there when you start talking about this this actually changes the whole trinitarian Doctrine completely it can't be uh and you know brother bradam he talks about as soon as you start trying to make God the first person person or the second person or any person you've missed it but it's it was not human blood it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus not three persons but one person there is that Revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself a body by means of the Virgin birth and dwelt and indwelt it that it might be the blood of God that would free us loose us entirely from our sins and present us spotless before himself with exceedingly great joy beautiful just beautiful would you like an Old Testament type let's go back to the Garden of Eden when the first news came to Glory the that the son Adam had been lost did God send an angel did he send him no did he send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem that lost son Hallelujah and you know we we hear Brother bam when he preaches this he says when God spoke those words Adam Adam Where Art Thou he knew exactly where Adam was but he wanted Adam to recognize where he was yes right he was God he knew exactly where he was sometimes it's presented in such a way that he was hiding around a tree or or he was hiding behind some sticks or even had a fig Leaf he had a a a a ghillie suit or something and and God just couldn't see him so he had to call his name God knew him he knew exactly where he was spiritually speaking and physically speaking there was no deception there brother Bram goes on to say God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us unto himself were saved by the blood of God the Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it and isn't it just a perfect trick of the devil to try and spin it any other way try and make it like a second or a third person or maybe you know Jesus was the the a good brother or a prophet or something he just wasn't maybe God himself in the flesh or or maybe once he actually went into the garden that God left him and now he was just a mortal man whose blood was it it had to be God all the way through because how could Jesus not being God say to the man on the cross today you'll be with me in Paradise how could just a mortal man say that it had to be God all the way through paragraph 119 consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ that walk not after the flesh they don't look at all the things of this world they put their eyes on Jesus Christ they focus on the things of the spirit those are the ones where there's no condemnation amen he goes on to say who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies justifieth declares us righteous who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died Romans 8:33 and 34 the r goes on to say there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation How can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin I I just feel like I could dwell here for a little while so I might just pause I don't know if we'll get through this tonight here but brothers and sisters this is I believe just so powerful if we could get this and live this in our lives just believe this in our lives maybe just say this over and over and over to ourselves maybe just play it over and over and over to ourselves there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood if we could do that brothers and sisters totally get that Revelation in our lives I can't I can't think that it would be quiet in here I can't think there would be a person who wouldn't want to raise their hands jump up and down and scream and shout because they recognize they're redeemed all Heaven's going to be quiet one day to listen to the redeemed worship brothers and sisters don't worry about your brother and sister here if you've got something in you that tells you that you are redeemed that you have been saved by his blood there's nothing to be condemned for than worship him you don't have to wait till you get there amen paragraph 121 now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations oh my we don't worship like that we're a multicultural worship group here that's right and you know what every group worships a little bit differently and you know we we can't get bound down by Creeds and and and doctrines and dogmas and say that's not the way I used to worship when I was in church way back over wherever that's not the way that they did it there what's it going to be like in heaven brothers and sisters brother brandham says this is the quietest place we're ever going to be and I I just can't help but think you know God didn't give us talents and gifts just so that we could have them here did he because if you play the guitar here I can't help but think you'll probably play the guitar there gifts and callings are without repentance if you play the saxophone I can only imagine you're going to play a saxophone one day before God and I just think you do already when we when we when we bring our gifts together and we worship it might not be what we're used to but I guarantee you when we get over there it ain't going to be what we're used to brothers and sisters so why not start it here oh my now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals and fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood if you still hold your faith to Creeds and denominations it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith in the word don't get bound down and you know what that's why I I just couldn't help but think about that brothers and sisters if we're not able to worship there's something wrong man there's something wrong who cares about anything else it's not about anybody else it's about you and God and are you going to say that something is going to hold my hands down and keep my voice quiet because you loose me from my sin but I just don't like the way they do something goodness sakes what's he going to say that day oh don't worry you can have a pass that's okay you don't have to worship me no his word says that if you don't worship me that the rocks will cry out immediately I think brother Ram he just says it here so clearly if you still hold your faith to Creeds and denominations remember brother Ken used to preach it all the time you could have a denomination of one I've got my ideas I live on my Island I've even got a flag I've got my position on the message of the hour and nobody can change me you know what you can have that all you want but brother bradam he says it here if you still hold your faith in Creeds and denominations it's certain by evidence that you have lost your faith in the word because remember going back to this paragraph I'm going to refer to this probably the entire time we talk about this book He said may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation all the way along brothers and sisters not just one time where I believe that I'm saved and I know the message of the hour no oh I can't help but preach sorry forgive me Kings and Priests I just want to pause here before we go too far I got a couple of quotes I have to bring just because I want to encourage us tonight brothers and sisters if we have been loose Lo from sin by his blood not ours by his if we've been loosed from our sin there is therefore when no condemnation not tomorrow not some other time and place right now you're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus doesn't matter what you've done in the past the only thing that matters is right now and moving forwards what's your desire is your desire to go in sin I am in church tonight but I just can't wait to get out and go and do that thing or whatever it is or or is it I just can't wait to go and look some of this up myself and and just get back into that thing that I was listening to and just continually have God reveal himself to me the seed of discrepancy in 1965 I in in the table it's paragraph 28 so it's early in the message not even sin I'll just let them look that up not even sin in the seed of discrepancy not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer why is that brothers and sisters because we've been washed by his blood by that perfect blood by that perfect Sacrifice by God himself coming down and hanging one on Satan and showing him you're not smart enough to outsmart me because I'm God and you're not not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer amen did you know that he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin see it's not even imputed why David said blessed is the man who God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin thank you Lord such a beautiful thing we're talking about it this week you know I smoke as much as I want I drink as much as I want I listen to as much as I want I watch as much as I want I just don't want I I just want to Fellowship around the word of God because I know what he's done for me I know what I come from and I think it's so important for us to have an experience with God where we know what kind of a skunk we truly are when we really can see what kind of a scoundrel this guy can be you know what outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're a brute beast that's what brother bradam said and I'll say man and woman doesn't matter it's not exclusive to just one one gender no no no human beings outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are a brute beast and until we have that realization it it can be really difficult to see where we've had that change in our lives but blessed is the man who God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ I remember coming to church initially and I was thinking my goodness how could I ever be this guy I don't know if I could ever be this guy because I've been that guy and I know who that guy is and I know the devil knows who that guy is and I know God knows who that guy is how could I ever be this guy that we're hearing about but you know the more that we feed upon the word brothers and sisters the more we become the word the more we recognize that we're not actually just becoming the word we are the word we're recognizing that we already were the word but you have no more conscience of sin it's the devil that comes around and says don't you remember you like that music you love that music don't you remember you like to go there you like to look at that you like to do this blah blah blah blah blah and we just need to say no no no no no that's the old man you know that's my past you're talking about buddy but you're not talking about my future my future is the word of God and hey why don't we go and talk about your future your future is Revelations 20:10 you'll be cast into the Lake of Fire how do you like that I like the sound of that and when we start to talk that way if you vocalize that brothers and sisters you'll cast those Devils out he'll be gone he doesn't want to hear nothing about that and that's where you get to the place where you become so hidden back in Christ where he can't even find you Satan can't even get you he doesn't want to deal with that why does he want to deal with that you don't have a conscience of sin you don't even have a remembrance of him anymore you don't desire it now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one and God only sees him whom you are in he only hears your voice and he wants to hear you worship and if you don't come to church on time how can you worship properly man it's not I don't even know why we keep going this way it's not about form to say I got to be at church exactly 30 minutes before because that's what the prophet said if that's what you're doing stay home but if you want to come to church to worship and you understand that God through the prophet said if you come half an hour early in the age in which you live you're going to have enough time to get all the garbage out of your life and to allow you to just open yourself up to the spirit of God and then when you start to worship then you're going to start to Worship in spirit and in truth around the truth of the day the truth of the hour my goodness but if you don't come to church on time you just miss out on half the service brothers and sisters the preaching of the word is one thing but giving God glory I I would say is the greatest portion of the service Hallelujah yes the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 very familiar quotes but I just thought they were so good we had to say them I couldn't not say him paragraph 265 you are the pure virtuous sinless bride you who you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God we almost there there we go thank you Lord I just want to make sure we can read it too every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in what the blood of Jesus Christ which is God and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you're perfect let's just skip down a little bit brother Bram he says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place isn't that beautiful remember brothers and sisters this isn't just a man that just rose up and had a great inspiration this is a Prophet this is a voice box of God God chose this man to fulfill this office the dispensational prophet to open his mouth and allow God to speak through him to have a prophetic utterance to this age so that we could actually comprehend what God's mind is God's expressing himself through this man to this generation you're standing completely you never sin at the first place God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and you're old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God can you imagine that and yet so many times we live here and we toil even with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we toil we struggle oh I did this oh I should have done that oh oh oh oh oh all these things in our lives but if we just listen to this this is what God is saying to us it's not a man it's God it's not just a good inspired service this is God speaking to a generation man your virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love it's just so beautiful I had to I had to bring those out I don't know how far we're going to get here I had lofy expectations you know what it's so good it's so rich brothers and sisters you never did it in the first place don't let Satan come around and try and hang one on you just tell him to get lost in the name of Jesus Christ he has no power No Authority it's been stripped Kings and Priests brother bradam going on here he said and he hath made us Kings and Priests unto God this is in the church age book Isaac he hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen Revelations 1 verse 6 paragraph 122 he hath made us he did it oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize in this this is one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings Spirit excuse me spiritual Kings oh we are going to be the Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom how many feels like they Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom I know I don't feel like it but the word of God says it so I believe it by faith we believe it for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which received abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ Romans 5:17 who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son Colossians 1:13 right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his own good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I think it's so important to just dwell on that brothers and sisters we're already there and the devil's going to say well you prayed and God didn't answer it he didn't answer it the way that you wanted it and you know what it's not up to us to change God's mind I was listening to that over and over again today brother Bram he says it it's not the right way to pray don't try and get God to change his mind pray that God would change your mind pray that God would change our mind we need to come in line with his word we need to become subject to his word and when we do that something happens brothers and sisters we pray different we'll pray different not my will but thy will let let that happen let that be what comes to pass because we know that will change everything and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of sanctifying lips is he talking about the ministry here is what I was thinking when I was studying this is he talking about the ministry it's got to be about the ministry the five-fold ministry spiritual praise from Sanctified lips no it can't be just a Ministry it's the Bride of Jesus Christ it's every single person that comes and accepts him according to the basis of his word in this age according to the instruction that he gave unto the Prophet this dispensational Prophet we're talking about and hath made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth one of these days we're going to get into worshiping this the subject of worshiping and I'm going to preach my heart out about it brothers and sisters if I haven't already but I'm going to and you know we the people who understand this message of the hour who truly get the bap AP ISM of the Holy Spirit are able to Worship in spirit and anyone else without that true baptism of the Holy Spirit brothers and sisters they think they're worshiping god brother brandham says it very clearly God through the prophet says it very clearly they're not worshiping God they're worshiping Satan the God of this evil age and they think they're worshiping God and that's pretty strong but that's what he said not in this quote but that's what he said we have the ability to worship Him in spirit and in truth it's not an exclusive thing only if you just come and get baptized in the name name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost not one place that they baptize in the name of the father son the holy ghost in the Bible we know that but if we worship Him according to the spirit the holy spirit in US brothers and sisters then we already have the truth because we've accepted it so there is a group of people that will worship in spirit and in truth it's not just earnestly from your heart because you sincerely want to worship God you can sincerely do something and be sincerely wrong my I'm just got to start all over again and made us priest yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and Kings unto our God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are A peculiar people zealous unto good works we we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father this is just so rich my the coming of God behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen Revelations 1:7 paragraph 125 he's coming Jesus is coming God is coming the prophet is coming the priest and King is coming the all in all is coming even so Lord Jesus come quickly amen he's coming he's coming in clouds Clouds Of Glory as when he was seen upon the Mount of transfiguration and his garments were shining as the power of God enfolded him and every eye shall see him that means this is not the Rapture Hallelujah very important to understand this brothers and sisters it's not the Rapture this is talking about Revelations 19 when we come back with him brother bradam says this means this is not the Rapture this is when he comes to take over his rightful place as World ruler this is when those who have pierced him with their Creeds and denominational doctrines shall mourn isn't that interesting it's not those that have pierced him with their spear in the side or or pierced his hands and his feet or or pierced his scalp with the crown of thorns it's not just the Jews isn't that interesting how he would say this those who have pierced him with their Creeds and their their dogmas their doctrines those ones that say this is how I believe it and I'm holding to it and I'm not willing to get that further Revelation my goodness brothers and sisters you don't have to be a Baptist to to do that you can Pierce him with your denominational doctrines and those people that pierced him with their Creeds and denominational doctrines shall mourn and all the people shall wail in Terror because of him who is the word paragraph 127 this is the Revelation story of Zachariah 129 to14 Zachariah prophesied this about 2 200 years ago it's just about to take place listen and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem look at what's happening over there how many nations are coming against Jerusalem my goodness and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced now brother bradam when is this gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is finished the gospel is ready to go back to the Jews here we have the prophet saying oh if I could just tell you something that's about to happen right in this our day what do you think he's going to say after what that sentence was just before that now when when is the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is finished the gospel is ready to go back to the Jews oh if I could just tell you something that's about to happen right in this our day this great thing that's about to happen will carry over to Revelation 11 and pick up those two witnesses those two prophets Moses and Elijah turning the gospel back to the Jews we're ready for it everything is in order this is 1960 he started in with this brothers and sisters here we are 2023 my as the Jews brought the message to the Gentiles even so the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews and the Rapture will come that's a contested sentence in there some people say brother Bram changed his his approach to that that that maybe it's not going to be the the Gentiles it take it back to the Jews but I I I don't know I have my opinion of it I'm not going to say it one way or the other I just think it's interesting as the the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews and the Rapture will come that's what he said now remember what we have read in Revelation and Zachariah both come right after the tribulation the Church of the firstborn does not go through the tribulation if you believe if you are the bride if you are the Church of the firstborn you do not go through the re the the the the tribulation he says we know that the Bible teaches that and at that time it says that God is going to pour out his Spirit upon the house of Israel it is the same spirit that was poured upon the Gentiles in their day I'm not saying it is but what I do want to say is if we ever want to see if God will pour out his Spirit just take a look at the Six Day War look up six- day war in Israel and you can see God pour out his spirit upon Israel the whole world came against Israel and Israel thumped them and that's there's no way that they should have been able to do that naturally speaking how could that happen he'll pour His Spirit out upon Israel so uh at that time it says that God is going to pour out his Spirit upon the house of Israel it's the same spirit that was poured upon the Gentiles in their day and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and they shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great mour in Jerusalem as the mour of Hadad rimon in the valley of meiden and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the House of David apart and their wives apart the family of the House of Nathan apart and their wives apart Zechariah 1210 to2 brother Bram speaking he he says each one of the houses apart when he comes in clouds of Glory at his second coming those Jews that pierced him shall see him as it says in another scripture and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends Zechariah 13:6 in the House of my friends those wounds remember those denominational Creeds and dogmas my goodness 132 not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected him as Messiah but it will be a mournful time for those left of the Gentiles who have rejected him as the savior of this day how do they reject him as as the savior of this day brothers and sisters to reject the prophet to reject the word of God that was given to this age by a prophetic utterance through a dispensational prophet that's identified in the word of God to reject that is to reject him to pierce him and you know this prophet he preached a sermon for God I just I'm just going to keep shining the light on it that way because I'm not trying to to uh just to be clear I don't want to belittle the prophet of God brother William Bram is our Prophet he's definitely our Prophet to this age but that Prophet was for a purpose and that was to get our attention on Christ the real Jesus Christ for our day brothers and sisters and it's only by the prophetic utterance that came through William Mary and bradam but he came for a purpose and that was to get our eyes on Jesus Christ and I know for sure that if he were to walk through those doors he would say Amen to those words because as soon as we try and put the attention on him he says you make me Antichrist I came to point to Christ but there's people in this message of the hour that will actually hold to their Creeds and their dogmas and they're going to pierce him through and we know this dispensational prophet he preached a sermon called indictment and he said God said through him I indict this generation for what the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ by rejecting him as the word when he came right 133 there will be weeping and wailing the sleeping virgin will be wailing they represent the church that refused to get oil the ones that didn't want to come to church and worship the sleeping virgins will be wailing they represent the church that refused to get oil symbol of the holy spirit in their lamps symbol of the body or holder of the oil until it was too late it wasn't that they were not good people they're great people they were virgins right virgins to the word they were virgins and that signifies a high moral order but they didn't have oil in their lamps so they were cast out where there was wailing and nashing of teeth and you know brothers and sisters the only way that I could see preaching this is I'm not preaching to the Baptists I'm not preaching to the Pentecostals right I'm preaching to the people that believe this message of the hour but we know there's three types of Believers and we know that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so that means there's going to be a true vine and a false Vine and they're going to be just like this all the way to the very end brothers and sisters and the only thing we can do is preach the word of God hoping that it will chop to the heart of each and every individual so they will be able to get oil amen yes it wasn't that they weren't good people they were virgins and that signifies a high moral order they didn't have oil in their lamps so they were cast out where there was wailing and nashing of tee teeth let us type this all out of Genesis 45 where Joseph meets his brethren in Egypt and reveals himself to them then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his Brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard he must have cried pretty loud and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am Joseph doth my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence what a powerful story this is and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve Reserve Life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earring or harvest my this is just this is so good you know how you talk I talk about Revelation happening this is happening to me as I'm reading this to you right now it's so good so good my goodness I'm not going to go off on it because I'll I just want to get going here this is so good man I'm going to get back into this and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance Genesis 45 1-7 he brother Bram he says now doesn't that compare with Zechariah 12 just beautifully putting the two together were bound to get it exactly right it has to be a word answer when Joseph was very young he was hated by his Brethren why was he hated by his Brethren it's because he was spiritual he couldn't help seeing those Visions nor could he help Dreaming Dreams and interpreting that was in him he could not display anything else but what was in him therefore when his brothers hated him it was without cause but he was the Beloved of the father of his father his father was a prophet and understood that makes a perfect type of Christ God the father loved his son but the Brethren scribes and Pharisees hated him because he could heal the sick do Miracles and foretell the future see visions and interpret them that was no reason to hate him but they did that's right and like Joseph's Brethren they hated him without a cause so beautiful how he just runs this parallel isn't it 137 now remember how those sons of Jacob treated Joseph they cast him into a pit they took his coat of many colors that his father had given give him and dipped it in blood to make his father think that the boy was killed by some animal they sold him to some slave traders who took him into Egypt and there he was resold to a general the General's wife had him falsely imprisoned but after some time his ability as a prophet brought him to the attention of pharaoh and he was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh with such Authority that none could approach Pharaoh unless he came first through Joseph now let us examine the life of Joseph while he was in Egypt for it is here we see him as the perfect type of Christ amen while in the house of the general he was falsely accused punished and in prison Without a Cause just like they did to Jesus there in prison he interpreted the dream of the Butler and the baker who were also prisoners with him the butler was restored to life but the other condemned to Death Christ was imprisoned on the cross forsaken by God and man on either side of him was a thief one died spiritually but the other was granted life and notice when Jesus was taken off the cross he was exalted into heaven and now sits at the right hand of the great spirit of Jehovah and no man can come to God except by him there is one mediator between God and Men and he is all you need there's no Martyrs Saints just Jesus keeping on with this type we find in Joseph notice how that everything he did in Egypt prospered his first job with the general prospered even the jail prospered when Jesus returns the desert will Blossom as a rose Hallelujah he is the son of prosperity I can only imagine that Joseph he must known how to worship no age has ever prospered as the one under Joseph so there is a time of such blessing coming on this Earth as the world has never known we can every one of us sit under our own fig tree and laugh and rejoice and live forever in his presence in his presence is fullness of joy and on his right hand there are Pleasures forever more praise God my we're getting there we're getting there but I don't know if we'll get all the way there now notice that everywhere Joseph went they sounded a trumpet to announce his arrival the people would scream bow the knee to Joseph no matter what a man was doing when that trumpet sounded he bowed the knee he could have been selling something in the street just reaching out for for his money but he had to stop and bend the knee when that trumpet blew if he were even a performer or an actor he would have to stop his act and bow the knee to Joseph when his presence was announced with that trumpet call and one of these days everything in time will stand still when the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and morning will break Eternal bright and fair everything will bow the knee then for it was it is written wherefore God ha also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in the earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Philippians 2:9 to11 I just can't help but think brothers and sisters to to to to go back and say we we can every one of us sit under our own fig tree and laugh and rejoice and live forever in his presence that's a promise that's coming we're going to do that and when we get together in in church we know the word of God says where two or three are gathered together in my name what I'm there in the midst so when he's here in our midst we brothers and sisters should be worshiping him we should be bowing the knee to him and giving him absolute reverence in our lives and not letting anybody stand in our way maybe the sound guys put the sound too loud maybe the piano player pays it too too too fast or too slow or the song leader sings it whatever or the drums or whatever it is are you going to let something stand in the way of your worship to God I want to say don't do it don't do it amen paragraph 141 I'm sorry I just keep harping on that I I just yeah it's the Lord sorry um but notice another glorious Revelation in this typing of Joseph Joseph while in Egypt was given a gentile brother died and and through her he received a family of two sons Ephraim and Manasseh Joseph asked his father to bless the two boys he placed them in front of Jacob and so that Manasseh the firstborn would be on Jacob's right and Ephraim on his left as as Jacob was about to bless them he crossed his hands so the right hand fell upon the younger while Joseph cried out not so father this is the firstborn to your right but Jacob said God cross my hands here in type we see the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the Jew was given over to the younger the Gentile through the cross crossed hands of the Lord Jesus Christ The Blessing comes through the cross Galatians 3:13-14 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us my for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen The Blessing of Abraham came through the cross of sorry The Blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles the Jews rejected the cross therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride now getting back to the story of Joseph meeting his Brethren do you call that not all the Brethren came Joseph knew that and insisted that all the Brethren appear before him or that he could not make himself known unto them finally they brought the one that was missing little Benjamin it was Benjamin the full brother of Joseph that set his soul on fire Benjamin little Benjamin typifies the 144,000 Israelites from all over the Earth who have gone back to Palestine for their Redemption they will be standing there ready to receive him whom to know a right is life eternal they will say this is our God for whom we have waited then they will see him whom they have pierced and they will cry out in dismay where did did these off wounds come from how did it happen and they will wail and cry every family apart everyone apart in the agony of Sorrow now where will the Gentile Church be when Jesus is making himself known to his Brethren I think this is just so rich brothers and sisters where will the Gentile Church be he says remember that the Bride of Joseph with the two children were in the palace for Joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all fall out before me so the Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace of Joseph where will the Gentile Church go in the Rapture into the palace the bride will be taken off of the earth she will be caught up before the Great Tribulation to meet her Lord in the air for three and 1 half years while the retributive wrath of God is poured out she will be in the great marriage supper of the Lamb then he will then will he return leaving his bride in his father's house while he makes himself known to his Brethren I just think this is portion here is so rich because all of the struggles all the trials all the tribulations we don't have to have more we get a place of rest his bride just gets put at a very safe place 147 at this very time the Antichrist Covenant that the Jews have made with Rome will be broken Rome and her allies then send their troops to destroy all the God-fearing word abiding Jews but as they come against the city to destroy it there will appear in the heavens the sign of the coming of the son of man with his mighty armies to destroy them who have been destroying the Earth with the Enemy repulsed Jesus then comes and presents himself to the 144,000 having seen his Mighty acts of Salvation they have come to know his power but also seeing his wounds and knowing that they have rejected him even to that moment causes them to cry out in agony of Terror and fear even as did their Brethren of old when they stood before Joseph being sore afraid that they would be killed but as Joseph said don't be angry with yourselves it's all right God was in it all he did it to preserve deserve life even so will Jesus speak peace and love to them why did the Jews reject Jesus God was in it all my so that they would be blinded so that we could be here why why did the Jews reject Jesus God was in it all it was the only way that he could bring out the Gentile bride he died on the cross to preserve the life of the Gentile church amen now these 144,000 are not in the bride in Revelation 14:4 they are called virgins and they will follow the lamb withs soever he goeth the fact that they have not defiled themselves with women shows that they are Unix Matthew 19:12 the unic were the keepers of the bridal Chambers they were attendants notice that they do not sit in the throne but are Before the Throne no they are not in the bride but will be in the Glorious Millennial Reign I I just as I studying this I just can't help but think you know I I'm going to want to go and shake some hands I'm going to want to go and and meet some people that had to go to owitz I want to go and meet some people that were blinded blinded when they cried out let let his blood be upon us and our children and set that murderer free let barabus go but put Jesus Christ on the cross I want to go and shake some hands for some people that didn't even hear those words that day but still fell under the curse of their forefathers oh my for me so that I could get the Salvation so that Jesus Christ goodness so he could go to the cross for me wow wow 151 we then see that when these last of Israel have been joined in love to the Lord and the enemy has been destroyed God will prepare his holy mountain and his new Garden of Eden for the bride died and his and her attendance for the Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the Earth anybody here ever gone on a honeymoon you're going to have a Thousand-Year honeymoon a Thousand-Year honeymoon upon the Earth as Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the Thousand Years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve true church will fulfill all the plan of God and I I I've heard it said that you know God is going to take his bride and he's going to parade her before the devil for a thousand years because during that time he's going to be bound by chains of circumstance he's not going to be gone he won't be out of existence then he won't be annihilated yet he has to actually try and tempt the people that are still on the earth and he won't be able to touch the bride the bride will have a glorified body there will be no way that he can tempt her at all my oh how the Bible repeats itself the scene of Joseph and his Brethren is about to be repeated for Jesus is coming soon amen we did it my and as we leave the type of Joseph there is one more thing I want to bring to your attention about this end time you recall that Joseph stood before his Brethren when Benjamin was not with them he spoke through an interpreter I'll call the musicians as we wrap this up tonight he spoke through an interpreter though he knew the Hebrew well he spoke to his brethren in another tongue did you know that the first Gentile age the head of gold Babylonian age went out with a message in tongues written on a wall this age is going out the same way the abundance of tongues in this day is a further proof that the times of the Gentiles is over and God has turned turning back to Israel I don't know how many people here have seen speaking in tongues and interpretations it's real it happens we don't need to be afraid of it but there's a bunch of people that are majoring on it and we know that that's not the right way to go that's not the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's what they put it all on but I I just think it's wonderful to look at it and here this this this this this depiction of what that means it's proof that the times of the Gentiles is over and God is turning back to Israel he's coming soon the Alpha and Omega the prophet priest and King the all in all Lord God of hosts is coming soon even so Lord Jesus the one and only true God come quickly God bless you tonight may be stand with me as we bow in prayer gracious ious Heavenly Father we thank you for this word thank you for the the book that we've been studying Lord Jesus thank you for the desire in the hearts of your children to Worship You Lord we know that there's only one reason we have that desire and that's because of your spirit inside of us and father if we don't desire to worship you for any other reason Lord we know that there's something wrong there's we read about it tonight father and I pray that Lord you would just heal our hearts father heal our minds heal our souls so that we would come to the place where nothing anywhere nobody would ever stop us from worshiping we know that Paul and Silas one night they were they were whipped they were beaten for the testimony of Jesus Christ and thrown into prison and in the middle of the night when the wounds started to hurt the most when it became the most painful with the dust and the dirt in their wounds and nobody did care for them what did they do they reached out and worshiped you father oh Lord and we have lives we live in the condition of soft living and sometimes still struggle to worship you father help us Lord father we believe but help thou our unbelief father that we could give you the glory that you desire father Lord I know that if we want to see you move in our lives if we want to see you move in our services then we need to give you the reverence that you desire amen father we love you and we thank you and we pray that we would just take
