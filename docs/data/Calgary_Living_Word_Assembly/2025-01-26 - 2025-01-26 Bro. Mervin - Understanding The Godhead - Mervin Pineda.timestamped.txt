[1:04:12] wanted to share with you it's the
[1:04:14] missions report that we did uh last
[1:04:17] December and January so uh let's see how
[1:04:21] how long it would take but uh it's just
[1:04:23] to see uh it's good to see what what's
[1:04:26] going on on the other side it's not only
[1:04:28] in the Philippines but we went also to
[1:04:30] Hawaii and uh we want to show you some
[1:04:33] pictures amen and uh let's see
[1:04:36] so the chch the first church that we we
[1:04:40] visited is the the Church of BR Nestor
[1:04:42] Espanola uh word message Believers
[1:04:45] Fellowship it's in Santa Mesa Manila
[1:04:48] immediately when we are when I arrived
[1:04:50] December 20th actually my wife uh went
[1:04:53] there end of November and then I just
[1:04:55] followed but uh for me because of work I
[1:04:58] have to travel December 18th and then
[1:05:02] arrive there December 20th and uh they
[1:05:05] uh they didn't know that uh we were we
[1:05:07] were coming but then the thing is just
[1:05:09] by respect or courtesy just tell them
[1:05:12] that you are there and then they ask you
[1:05:13] to preach and uh you know to visit their
[1:05:16] their churches and it's a blessing amen
[1:05:19] uh we we need to be instant in season
[1:05:21] and out of season and we just have to be
[1:05:23] loaded with the word so that wherever we
[1:05:25] are called then we can we can be a
[1:05:27] blessing
[1:05:29] amen so I have some pictures uh that we
[1:05:32] have there uh so this is their Church
[1:05:36] basically so this is one day before
[1:05:39] the uh the camp meeting the first camp
[1:05:41] meeting that we attended and uh there's
[1:05:44] not so many people because they're
[1:05:46] getting ready to go because the it's
[1:05:49] about three and a half hours from Manila
[1:05:52] three three and a half hours from Manila
[1:05:54] the uh the camp site which is in Nev AA
[1:05:58] that's where brother Dany uh and and the
[1:06:02] rest of them built a a campsite
[1:06:05] basically and uh it's still ongoing and
[1:06:08] there's a lot of work there but I have
[1:06:10] pictures also for that so you can see
[1:06:12] their congregation here and
[1:06:16] uh you can see uh not much here so we
[1:06:21] just shared the uh the message of the
[1:06:23] hour because they they are also
[1:06:25] believers and uh they are one of the big
[1:06:27] churches also in Manila they have I
[1:06:30] don't know maybe three or 400 uh uh
[1:06:33] members there but this time is there
[1:06:36] already on the way to to the camp
[1:06:37] meeting so the second one that we
[1:06:40] attended is
[1:06:41] uh that's
[1:06:44] the elect bride assembly Global Outreach
[1:06:48] a that morning I preach and then in the
[1:06:50] afternoon we visited the the church
[1:06:53] where brother Ken and brother Barry
[1:06:55] preach before and the reason why we also
[1:06:59] visited this because we have friend here
[1:07:01] who was the
[1:07:03] preacher bar kri digs and he will be our
[1:07:05] preacher in next month amen and uh there
[1:07:09] he's a good friend and also the other
[1:07:10] preacher was uh brother uh Jack Duff and
[1:07:16] uh it was a great blessing also to to be
[1:07:19] with them and just to support the
[1:07:21] ministry and they they are the speakers
[1:07:24] for the other C meeting in Philippines
[1:07:27] so there are so so many camp meetings
[1:07:30] there in in in the Philippines and uh
[1:07:32] because they cannot fit in one Camp
[1:07:35] imagine the the number of Believers
[1:07:37] almost every Camp has a thousand
[1:07:38] attendees so which is good to see the
[1:07:41] Believers of different churches and they
[1:07:43] also come from different nations also we
[1:07:46] have they have from Japan Australia and
[1:07:49] and and and some other uh countries in
[1:07:52] Asia amen and uh it's good to see the
[1:07:55] them yeah brother Jack Duff is a very
[1:07:57] good singer I I they they sang actually
[1:08:00] even brother kyri because they're both
[1:08:02] song leaders before and uh we heard them
[1:08:05] in action amen it's good to see them and
[1:08:10] uh yeah these are the ministers that
[1:08:13] attended that uh we were there and uh
[1:08:17] yeah this brother re Orana is the host
[1:08:20] Pastor over there so yeah and the other
[1:08:23] pastors in in Philippines as well as
[1:08:25] well and this brother is the pastor in
[1:08:28] Japan so he's uh yeah in Yokohama so I
[1:08:31] think uh sister yeah sister Grace and
[1:08:35] and brother Andrew met him yeah so
[1:08:38] wherever you go just look for a message
[1:08:40] Church it might be there
[1:08:43] amen and it's good that uh even though
[1:08:46] you don't know them you have common
[1:08:48] denominator and uh they will let you in
[1:08:51] their house although they don't know you
[1:08:53] right as long as you you have the the
[1:08:55] message with you which is Christ amen
[1:08:58] it's good to
[1:09:00] Fellowship oh this one doesn't want to
[1:09:02] go maybe you can go with the next slide
[1:09:05] brother the sisters and then the next
[1:09:08] one yeah so and then after that
[1:09:12] immediately the next day we went to the
[1:09:14] first camp meeting and uh we're just
[1:09:17] supposed to attend but they asked me to
[1:09:19] speak the opening it's so difficult
[1:09:22] to not to be ready when when you're just
[1:09:25] attending and then they will let you uh
[1:09:28] you know it's an honor actually when uh
[1:09:32] when you attend and they will let you
[1:09:35] speak through people who are already
[1:09:38] Veterans of the message and uh we don't
[1:09:40] we don't say we we know the message but
[1:09:43] the gift in us we just have to surrender
[1:09:45] so these are the it's an opening in the
[1:09:47] evening there so they their their topic
[1:09:51] is from Vision to reality and I preached
[1:09:54] the the m Masterpiece here and it just
[1:09:57] jived with their team and uh uh good
[1:10:00] thing that we we bring all all the
[1:10:03] studies that we do and and and the the
[1:10:06] sermons and teachings
[1:10:08] and and uh that time I I challenge them
[1:10:12] actually it's about the baptism the
[1:10:14] right baptism and immediately they they
[1:10:17] cannot wait the next day three already
[1:10:18] decided to get baptized that same night
[1:10:21] and we're just so thankful we just need
[1:10:24] to challenge sometimes the the seed that
[1:10:27] was planted in that in in every person
[1:10:30] they just need to be watered and once
[1:10:32] that is Quicken then you cannot just
[1:10:34] wait so but in total we know there there
[1:10:37] are 15 Souls uh the next uh slide here
[1:10:40] so yeah this is their first night not
[1:10:44] many people already arrived but then uh
[1:10:47] yeah but that that evening I think
[1:10:49] they're around 400 or so so at least uh
[1:10:53] you can see this is the campsite that
[1:10:56] they built and we are you know with with
[1:10:59] our little uh uh donations from our
[1:11:02] church here they were able to you know
[1:11:04] it it's a good help for them we cannot
[1:11:07] afford all this because it's expensive
[1:11:08] but then with different churches putting
[1:11:11] their uh you know uh their donations
[1:11:14] together from North America Australia
[1:11:17] wherever they were able to put this
[1:11:19] together and this one is being used for
[1:11:21] the church now for the Believers for
[1:11:23] free of course there are some uh cost
[1:11:26] Associated of course right with the
[1:11:27] people food and whatnot but then at
[1:11:29] least the the venue is already free amen
[1:11:32] and we are part of that Calgary living
[1:11:34] world Assembly you're part of that
[1:11:36] mission amen so you the money that we
[1:11:38] put as offerings or missions they go to
[1:11:41] the right place amen and not only in
[1:11:43] Philippines but also other places like
[1:11:45] in Africa and and yeah but that's not
[1:11:48] the point the point I'm talking about
[1:11:50] here is uh the missions that we we do
[1:11:53] because I already mentioned before there
[1:11:55] are three uh three uh you can say uh
[1:12:00] groups uh of people that uh support a
[1:12:03] mission either you're praying you're
[1:12:06] financially uh uh donating or you're the
[1:12:09] one going right so you can categorize
[1:12:12] yourself where you you fit in that I
[1:12:14] know many will say oh I'll just pray
[1:12:16] because they don't want to give money
[1:12:19] but but that's not the point if you have
[1:12:21] something if God Gave You gives you
[1:12:24] something which is extra you can say or
[1:12:27] you know for your future then it means
[1:12:29] you're a good Steward of his Blessing
[1:12:32] amen we're not pulling money but then
[1:12:34] you know how blessing works right uh God
[1:12:37] loves a cheerful Giver amen so that's
[1:12:40] why all these things are happening
[1:12:42] because at the end of the day the
[1:12:44] purpose is to look for the last
[1:12:45] predestinated seed so that we can go to
[1:12:49] into Glory with him amen because uh
[1:12:51] later on I I'll put some slides so
[1:12:54] because we can go until that last seed
[1:12:57] is in until last that last seed is
[1:13:01] matured amen although we find that last
[1:13:04] last predestinated seed then is in the
[1:13:06] church he needs to mature that's why the
[1:13:08] five-fold ministry is important amen
[1:13:11] amen so we can see oh
[1:13:14] sorry yeah this you can see it's a
[1:13:17] basketball court and then they use it
[1:13:19] for for uh for big uh services like this
[1:13:23] amen
[1:13:25] and you can see uh this is the report
[1:13:28] from d b Danny I just uh I just put it
[1:13:31] there so
[1:13:32] that we can see the the result so at
[1:13:37] least 15 Souls were touched by that uh
[1:13:41] December 23rd to 26 amen which is amen
[1:13:46] one soul is worth 10,000 worlds amen so
[1:13:51] when when you witness to someone and uh
[1:13:54] and uh uh and he or she accepts it's
[1:13:58] it's a it's a crown Amen in our heads
[1:14:01] it's that's why we need to be used amen
[1:14:04] not not not just sitting here and I know
[1:14:08] this one is for maturity but then at the
[1:14:10] same time if you cannot go send someone
[1:14:14] amen so next slide you can see how many
[1:14:18] so approximately
[1:14:21] thousand thousand uh uh participants
[1:14:25] traveled by land and seas While others
[1:14:29] literally walked two days in the
[1:14:31] mountains as the waves in the seas are
[1:14:33] so high so there are so also delegates
[1:14:36] from Japan amen so it's a good
[1:14:39] Fellowship amen amen and uh you can see
[1:14:43] the the condition there so some uh were
[1:14:46] intense yeah so and they also built a
[1:14:51] dormitory there and it's full because of
[1:14:53] thousand people it's difficult to to
[1:14:55] manage but then most churches are uh
[1:14:59] responsible for their own members so
[1:15:01] they bought some tents also amen and for
[1:15:04] their food as well uh they have to bring
[1:15:06] food because you cannot just feed a
[1:15:08] thousand people so so it's it's a
[1:15:11] collaboration amen it's not competition
[1:15:13] it's collaboration amen so you can see
[1:15:18] there
[1:15:20] oops uh
[1:15:25] this kind of sensitive
[1:15:27] okay next
[1:15:30] one all right okay so yeah there there
[1:15:35] it's a big uh it's a big land and then
[1:15:37] there's a lot of uh improvements there
[1:15:40] so yeah he was saying here the drainage
[1:15:43] system they were able to to do the
[1:15:45] canals you see uh it's a lot of work
[1:15:47] amen uh and it needs a lot of uh uh
[1:15:52] Financial uh blessing
[1:15:55] to go to them because uh they're just
[1:15:58] they're kind of big church but then the
[1:16:00] thing is with with the amount of work
[1:16:02] that will be done here it will be a lot
[1:16:04] amen but uh they were able to to do it
[1:16:07] progressively because you cannot do this
[1:16:08] at one time it's a lot of uh a lot of uh
[1:16:11] require uh Financial requirements
[1:16:18] amen yeah that's me and my wife actually
[1:16:21] so yeah with this is Brother Nestor you
[1:16:25] know him and brother Jun this is a
[1:16:26] pastor also and another Pastor brother
[1:16:29] cha brother Danny and the wife sister
[1:16:31] Sabel amen uh so okay let's go forward
[1:16:36] it's kind of fck brother
[1:16:44] okay there you go so you see they've
[1:16:47] been doing the water tank the electrical
[1:16:49] outdoor shower rooms and restrooms so
[1:16:51] that uh if uh if
[1:16:55] because they've been inviting
[1:16:56] International speakers as well so you
[1:16:58] know the the problem in North America we
[1:17:01] have we are so comfortable that when you
[1:17:03] go there you want your washrooms to be
[1:17:05] same as here but uh it's impossible so
[1:17:08] they they're trying their
[1:17:10] best to to do that too so yeah so you
[1:17:13] see all the young people they Reed some
[1:17:16] goodies here amen and uh praise the Lord
[1:17:19] amen that's the that's the first camp we
[1:17:22] attended and the second camp we attended
[1:17:24] is uh the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:26] Family Camp that's the home church or
[1:17:29] original home Church of the aqu Queens
[1:17:32] sister Zena and uh bar Cyrus and the
[1:17:35] their dad barelis is the is the pastor
[1:17:38] there uh and and the Apostle as well and
[1:17:41] uh you can see yeah we were there on the
[1:17:44] 26th which is a Thursday amen and
[1:17:49] uh oops oh next next slide brother
[1:17:55] so I think uh I don't know how many they
[1:17:59] they attended but uh they're also big uh
[1:18:02] big uh so many churches collaborated in
[1:18:05] the first Camp around 35 36 churches 36
[1:18:09] pastors here also it's the same thing
[1:18:11] but then the thing is they are all over
[1:18:13] the Philippines and they you know the
[1:18:16] Philippines has 7,700 Islands so you
[1:18:18] cannot just you know bring all of them
[1:18:21] so now what they're trying to do uh
[1:18:25] with Brothers helis is uh they're trying
[1:18:27] to to to uh
[1:18:30] decentralize you can say the the camps
[1:18:32] so they have in in in the South as well
[1:18:36] so that's why they're building a new
[1:18:38] Campground in uh in in the South uh in
[1:18:41] Mindanao area so they they needed help
[1:18:45] on that that's why we we we also help a
[1:18:47] little bit our church with that small
[1:18:50] you can say we're not big church but uh
[1:18:54] with any amount that's why all our
[1:18:56] children are are Inus when you show them
[1:18:59] that even their $5 $10 $15 makes uh you
[1:19:02] know it it will help them it will help
[1:19:06] uh you know that that will go a little
[1:19:08] bit far when they are put together amen
[1:19:13] so yeah so that one so my wife was
[1:19:16] testifying here I know I didn't have a
[1:19:18] good good uh uh good shot of the picture
[1:19:23] here but uh she was test testifying of
[1:19:25] the the healing of our of her mom my
[1:19:28] mother-in-law which happened here
[1:19:31] basically uh through our prayers when
[1:19:33] when uh brother kyri digs was preaching
[1:19:37] here and uh at the end of the service uh
[1:19:40] it's a prayer uh it's like it's not an
[1:19:43] altar call but uh he ask us to stand and
[1:19:46] raise our hands and uh ask for our
[1:19:49] prayers and then my wife SE seated with
[1:19:53] Lynn uh in that uh area there uh she she
[1:19:58] was uh you know uh raising her hand and
[1:20:02] then what she said to herself is if the
[1:20:05] preacher will touch my hand my mom will
[1:20:08] will be healed and walk again because uh
[1:20:11] my mother-in-law fell
[1:20:13] also right and then uh she was bedridden
[1:20:16] for many months but then that evening or
[1:20:20] that that
[1:20:21] service you know brother kyri I think
[1:20:24] she he was here and we were there and
[1:20:27] I'm I'm in the middle and then brother
[1:20:30] kyri just went there and touched my my
[1:20:33] wife's uh
[1:20:34] hand if he will touch somebody's hand he
[1:20:37] should have come through me first but
[1:20:39] then he went uh to the other side there
[1:20:43] and he she testified on that and many
[1:20:45] were blessed and even even uh sister
[1:20:48] Linda it's very uh similar right I mean
[1:20:52] the fate of my wife made their whole
[1:20:56] amen right because sometimes although
[1:20:58] they're not Believers it's our faith
[1:21:00] remember we preach on Ezekiel 37 he was
[1:21:06] prophesying Ezekiel was prophesying to
[1:21:08] dead Dry Bones right and it's the faith
[1:21:11] of the one
[1:21:13] Speaking that made those bones to put in
[1:21:16] line and become
[1:21:18] alive amen so this kind of testimonies
[1:21:22] they're powerful God is still healing
[1:21:24] amen amen and uh it's good to to share
[1:21:26] the testimonies that we have amen it
[1:21:28] will bless someone amen
[1:21:31] so amen so amen that's and then the the
[1:21:36] third church that we we visited is we
[1:21:39] flew through that and this is one of the
[1:21:42] churches that got uh hit uh by the
[1:21:45] flooding the the typhoon but they were
[1:21:47] not flooded like the one that we helped
[1:21:49] with brother Ryan but we visited them as
[1:21:51] well so you can see it's brother
[1:21:54] Victor's
[1:21:56] this is their kind congregation not so
[1:21:57] big but uh uh you know they they love
[1:22:00] the Lord amen and they claim that they
[1:22:03] believe the message of the hour amen so
[1:22:06] yeah this is this is Pastor Vic and this
[1:22:09] is Pastor Ryan and the wife and the this
[1:22:12] the Deacon of brother Ryan so we visited
[1:22:15] imagine the sister here it's the first
[1:22:18] time to to meet them they are in the
[1:22:21] same they're in the same island maybe
[1:22:23] around 30 minutes it's away because of
[1:22:26] different doctrines before in the
[1:22:28] Philippines they don't Fellowship but
[1:22:30] then when you come and you're neutral
[1:22:32] you're trying to to be an instrument so
[1:22:35] that you can you know break some walls
[1:22:38] of or barriers and you know how it goes
[1:22:41] right with the story of the duck the
[1:22:44] Ducks they're on different uh different
[1:22:47] uh fences and then they don't fellowship
[1:22:50] and then they're wondering why they
[1:22:51] don't Fellowship so the only way to make
[1:22:53] them Fellowship is raise the water which
[1:22:56] is the water of the word right then uh
[1:22:59] one once the that word is raised then
[1:23:01] all the Ducks will come out of their
[1:23:03] denominational thinking or barriers amen
[1:23:06] and now they are fellowshipping which is
[1:23:07] praise the Lord thank hallelujah amen
[1:23:12] so yeah they gave us a an North American
[1:23:17] breakfast actually praise the Lord they
[1:23:19] thought that we're uh we're not used
[1:23:22] with Filipino food but we are
[1:23:25] praise the Lord with h and uh
[1:23:28] eggs and they're good people amen you
[1:23:31] can see amen that's the wife sister
[1:23:34] Vicki yeah
[1:23:37] amen praise the
[1:23:41] Lord and uh this is uh in Bol area and
[1:23:45] uh actually this is on top of their
[1:23:48] church and this uh volcano is a Mayon
[1:23:52] Volcano the it's Ren n for its perfect
[1:23:55] cone so it's a when you go to to that
[1:23:59] area for sure they will boast on this uh
[1:24:03] uh it's a good scener actually for us we
[1:24:08] we we were we were born in Loon which is
[1:24:11] close to Manila and we only studied this
[1:24:14] in our subjects in in the school but
[1:24:17] then when it comes to
[1:24:19] Revelation you might read it you might
[1:24:22] see it in the picture but you don't you
[1:24:24] don't see it and I mean you don't uh
[1:24:27] recognize or or appreciate it until you
[1:24:30] go there so we we went to the to the to
[1:24:33] this area and then now it's not anymore
[1:24:35] in the books we already saw it so it's
[1:24:38] totally revealed to us that it's really
[1:24:40] beautiful you can see it's a Kind of
[1:24:43] Perfect amen so but it's a volcano so it
[1:24:47] erupts almost every year right
[1:24:50] so but they got used to it so anyway so
[1:24:54] so brother brother vickel is you see
[1:24:57] during that typhoon all because uh his
[1:25:01] fences are made of bamboo and wood you
[1:25:03] know how it goes so it just fell and you
[1:25:07] know with little money so we told them
[1:25:09] okay so we were able to help little
[1:25:12] right with this little uh uh little
[1:25:16] Sacrifice from us uh it will help the
[1:25:20] church so at least because they were
[1:25:22] flooded as well it went maybe 2T deep
[1:25:24] only in this area but it went inside the
[1:25:27] church so he wanted to to build a fence
[1:25:29] concrete wall so that at least the water
[1:25:31] will not get in because I don't know
[1:25:34] their their location I told them you're
[1:25:36] very accommodating you accommodate every
[1:25:38] flood or every typhoon that come you're
[1:25:40] so
[1:25:43] kind it's a it's true story though I
[1:25:46] mean because that area is it's in the
[1:25:49] middle and it's in the Pacific so it's a
[1:25:53] they they receive a lot of typhoons
[1:25:55] every year I don't know how many but too
[1:25:56] much amen so but uh but they are
[1:26:00] resilient right so so we're we're
[1:26:03] thankful that we have those kind of
[1:26:04] people amen because they need to survive
[1:26:07] so the the the fourth church we attended
[1:26:09] is brother martial olena this all of
[1:26:12] them I didn't know them before so we
[1:26:15] went there and just uh we we only knew
[1:26:18] brother Ryan because of communication
[1:26:20] but then the other pastors we didn't
[1:26:21] know but then you know the reason why we
[1:26:24] go there is so that we can see for
[1:26:25] ourselves right it's not only by picture
[1:26:28] so we can we can see that there's a real
[1:26:30] need wherever you go there's always a
[1:26:32] need amen so that's uh brother marial
[1:26:36] oliven so so we went there in the
[1:26:40] evening and uh yeah their church is also
[1:26:44] needing some of this uh ceiling and we
[1:26:49] helped them a little bit and then
[1:26:50] immediately what we gave them the little
[1:26:53] money they already built it and it was
[1:26:56] done only needs painting and now they
[1:27:00] use it already for for their service
[1:27:03] right so you can see before so it's good
[1:27:06] to to see where your man is going also
[1:27:09] right it's direct to them amen so praise
[1:27:13] the Lord that's the that's the fourth
[1:27:15] church that we
[1:27:17] attended I didn't preach on that uh
[1:27:20] third and fourth but on the fifth one
[1:27:22] because uh the plan is so that we we can
[1:27:24] gather all of them in one location so
[1:27:27] it's not difficult for the preacher also
[1:27:29] so we went to the fifth Church which is
[1:27:31] the house of God's word ministry which
[1:27:33] is Brian brother Ryan mendosa's Church
[1:27:36] uh this is where we helped before to to
[1:27:39] to give them some good this and uh you
[1:27:41] know and this is the one that has 10 to
[1:27:43] 12 feet of flood so you you have seen it
[1:27:46] before I I showed you before this one
[1:27:49] and then when I when we went there so
[1:27:52] this is the actually
[1:27:54] this is the house of brother Chad one of
[1:27:56] the deacons and musician and uh this is
[1:28:00] a uh an access to the to the church
[1:28:03] because the church is this side and
[1:28:06] brother Chad's uh house is this side so
[1:28:10] you can see this is the first floor
[1:28:12] almost this is already subsided for
[1:28:14] about 2 feet or something so and then
[1:28:17] when we went there I I was here so you
[1:28:20] can see the it's already subsided so I
[1:28:23] think this this is a video
[1:28:25] brother maybe if you can play
[1:28:28] it
[1:28:33] yeah so that's the same thing so at
[1:28:36] least uh you can see something growing
[1:28:39] already right so
[1:28:46] yeah it's a good location if there's no
[1:28:49] flood for sure right there's something
[1:28:52] to to to look forward to see and and
[1:28:56] anyway the beauty of the the place is
[1:28:59] with the people anyway right wherever
[1:29:01] you go if there's no believer or there's
[1:29:03] no no one that uh you know uh that uh
[1:29:06] that you are uh same like you with like
[1:29:11] Precious Faith then it's a difficult uh
[1:29:13] location wherever wherever you go amen
[1:29:16] and that's why we have to look for
[1:29:17] wherever you go even even in vacation
[1:29:20] you have to look for believers amen and
[1:29:22] uh you will have good fellow ship
[1:29:26] amen next slide brother yeah and then uh
[1:29:29] this is before the morning service we
[1:29:32] have a breakfast here this time is a
[1:29:33] Filipino breakfast which is good amen
[1:29:39] uh yeah that's the the
[1:29:42] morning you can see maybe their their
[1:29:46] congregations about 100 or so including
[1:29:49] children 100 120 but the morning service
[1:29:52] is dedic uh is for their service so we
[1:29:56] didn't invite the other churches and in
[1:29:58] the afternoon we did and then it's even
[1:30:01] Fuller or I mean more people that came
[1:30:04] during the the afternoon and yeah so
[1:30:07] these are pastors this is Pastor Vic and
[1:30:09] this is Pastor Gary and other pastors uh
[1:30:13] behind I don't know the names but uh
[1:30:15] they were able to Fellowship
[1:30:18] together when we were there and we're so
[1:30:20] glad and immediately after that service
[1:30:23] then there someone anniversaries in
[1:30:24] their churches and they invited each
[1:30:26] other then uh they're now fellowshipping
[1:30:30] and then they will have a camp meeting
[1:30:31] now which is good because uh it's good
[1:30:34] to Fellowship right it's unifying time
[1:30:37] our our theme during when we were there
[1:30:40] is about the unity of the Brethren
[1:30:42] basically so because we have common
[1:30:44] denominators Jesus Christ amen and now
[1:30:46] they're fellowshipping not only these
[1:30:48] pastors but other pastors as well so
[1:30:51] which is praise the Lord I think uh
[1:30:53] that's a uh that's the good uh thing
[1:30:56] that happened there and uh we know the
[1:30:59] word is always the word they never heard
[1:31:02] new message or preaching but then at
[1:31:04] least there's a you can say new blood
[1:31:07] that came in that is neutral that
[1:31:09] doesn't side with any other Doctrine but
[1:31:12] the doctrine of the message of the hour
[1:31:14] and the Bible amen so which is good amen
[1:31:18] we're thankful for
[1:31:21] that yeah there some pictures here
[1:31:25] then of course after preaching again the
[1:31:27] afternoon food again so you know how it
[1:31:29] goes when you when you preach or when
[1:31:31] you visit churches it's always food
[1:31:33] after
[1:31:35] amen not natural spiritual food and then
[1:31:39] natural food amen all right
[1:31:45] so yeah okay so this is before we left
[1:31:49] to our hotel and then went back to
[1:31:52] Manila then the next church we visited
[1:31:55] is uh yeah this time I I preach at
[1:31:58] brother Reay sanos Church in pasig
[1:32:01] January 1st their New Year's uh service
[1:32:05] so yeah we we were able to uh pour out
[1:32:09] some uh some of the gift that that's in
[1:32:12] us and uh we were blessed and uh yeah I
[1:32:18] think they have around 600 people or 600
[1:32:22] members uh I think cuz sister Shel went
[1:32:25] there before they were not able to fit
[1:32:27] in one location but they were able to to
[1:32:30] rent a big location now so all of the
[1:32:32] five groups can can go together but uh
[1:32:35] this is a Wednesday and uh it's not so
[1:32:38] much maybe half of them only or
[1:32:40] something but then I I again reiterated
[1:32:44] the the testimony of my wife and they
[1:32:46] were thankful because it's a
[1:32:48] Wednesday uh it's a Wednesday and then
[1:32:52] also I I I uh shared the testimony of
[1:32:55] sister uh hilderbrand sister Becky
[1:32:58] because it's a it's a Wednesday and it's
[1:33:00] even at the worship service she was
[1:33:03] healed she she was asked to raise her
[1:33:05] hand to stand up and raise her hand and
[1:33:08] and she was healed so you see how it
[1:33:10] goes I know at first first and two pools
[1:33:13] is about natural healing but then later
[1:33:16] on we go to the third pool which is the
[1:33:18] healing of the Soul right so it's just
[1:33:20] to to get the the big fish so you have
[1:33:23] to you know give them because God still
[1:33:26] heals physically amen he didn't uh
[1:33:30] Divine Healing is still present with us
[1:33:32] although we have the word fully but we
[1:33:34] have the Divine Healing as well
[1:33:37] amen which is physically and both
[1:33:41] physically and spiritually
[1:33:43] amen okay
[1:33:45] so after that we went to Hawaii but then
[1:33:50] the thing is uh because the first seven
[1:33:52] are in Philippines this is the lamp's
[1:33:55] wife assembly brother Eduardo evasco I
[1:33:57] didn't visit the church this is uh uh
[1:34:01] Sister C's son and sister Emily's
[1:34:05] brother uh and this church the pastor
[1:34:09] there the former Pastor is uh brother
[1:34:12] Danny Bernardo he was the one who
[1:34:15] baptized me and my wife in 20052 2006
[1:34:19] they're part of our lives right so
[1:34:22] because uh they were the one one witness
[1:34:24] to me brother Dandy who is in Qatar he's
[1:34:27] the pastor now but the former Pastor
[1:34:30] there also pass away and uh brother
[1:34:33] Danny brother Danny and and and brother
[1:34:35] hermy they all pass away in 2018 same as
[1:34:38] brother Ken so it's a yeah it's kind of
[1:34:42] sad uh year for us 2018 and then my mom
[1:34:46] also passed away 2018
[1:34:49] so and then I asked the Lord what what's
[1:34:52] going on so hard you're going to take
[1:34:54] everyone uh that we love but then the
[1:34:56] thing is there's something for us right
[1:34:58] so we need to go ahead and we know that
[1:35:01] they're in a better place than us amen
[1:35:03] do you think that they would want to
[1:35:05] come back I don't think so this flesh
[1:35:08] is is is our number one enemy right not
[1:35:12] other people right so it's uh so he he
[1:35:16] sent us some uh some pictures of the
[1:35:18] construction actually the need in in
[1:35:22] this church uh in in Ed's church is uh
[1:35:25] because the church that they are uh
[1:35:27] fellowshipping now they will demolish
[1:35:29] that church they're just renting so a
[1:35:31] good brother or a family just donated a
[1:35:34] good land so that they can build a
[1:35:36] church so yeah I told Brother Barry as
[1:35:39] well and uh uh you know this is ongoing
[1:35:42] right now so they're building a church
[1:35:46] on that land so that they will have
[1:35:47] their own church we know it's not about
[1:35:49] church building or you know uh uh
[1:35:53] building building schools or
[1:35:54] universities or whatever but then you
[1:35:56] need the place to worship isn't it
[1:35:59] wonderful when you can sit like this and
[1:36:01] then we can talk about the Lord right so
[1:36:03] you know there's balance right we don't
[1:36:06] need to spiritualize everything we need
[1:36:08] also something that we can uh uh you
[1:36:11] know we can uh it's a physical building
[1:36:14] although the Tabernacle of God is in man
[1:36:18] us but this is the house of the Lord
[1:36:20] where we can Fellowship amen so we we we
[1:36:23] help as well so you see so many churches
[1:36:27] little little little then later on you
[1:36:30] you are part of the their Ministry the
[1:36:32] part of the work there which is good and
[1:36:34] it will encourage us even to give more
[1:36:37] because uh we are registered
[1:36:39] organization and anything that we put
[1:36:42] it's tax deductible right so which is
[1:36:45] good I mean uh we just want to take
[1:36:48] advantage of that blessing in
[1:36:51] Philippines there's nothing like that
[1:36:53] and anything that you you give to the
[1:36:55] church there's no return right so unlike
[1:36:58] here we we have that uh uh privilege
[1:37:03] amen so you see the construction
[1:37:08] there yeah so they have the walls
[1:37:11] already so and then putting the beams
[1:37:13] and columns which is good so this is
[1:37:17] yeah this the perspective so you will
[1:37:19] see the end result so yeah we will we'll
[1:37:23] try to to help progressively even me
[1:37:25] personally I I want to help them because
[1:37:28] uh not only because they are part of me
[1:37:30] because uh they were the one used but
[1:37:33] then we want them to be a blessing also
[1:37:35] to to look for the last Souls as well
[1:37:38] right and then for them to mature amen
[1:37:40] so so this is this is the thing in uh in

[1:40:49] available at that time but now brother
[1:40:51] Randy and sister Leia's family are
[1:40:53] fellowshipping and then they wanted to
[1:40:55] to share with the men's meeting that
[1:40:57] they have what the message is hopefully
[1:41:00] let's pray for them you know it's good
[1:41:02] to go to Hawaii and then there's a
[1:41:04] church right so it's it's not an
[1:41:06] invitation but at least it's an
[1:41:08] attraction so yes amen so yeah and these
[1:41:13] are most of us right so yeah the the
[1:41:17] Chua family peda family yeah and the
[1:41:20] Arisa family yeah we we were about 25 or
[1:41:25] so yeah the during that church service
[1:41:29] you need only a family or even a two
[1:41:32] family or two right to start a church
[1:41:34] and then as long as you're you're
[1:41:36] witnessing then you can you can proceed
[1:41:39] amen all right then then again food God
[1:41:44] bless you for that yeah so let's go to
[1:41:46] the so I hope uh you'll be encouraged to
[1:41:52] help also in in in missions right so
[1:41:55] because uh it's good to be used amen and
[1:42:01] like I've said if we want to be blessed
[1:42:04] be a good Steward because everything
[1:42:07] belongs to God and if he gives you extra
[1:42:09] extra extra it means there's a need that
[1:42:12] is required so that that extra will be
[1:42:15] uh given to to the needs right so maybe
[1:42:19] yeah let's go to the to the preaching
[1:42:21] and uh and have only 30 minutes let's
[1:42:25] see how how far we can go I know
[1:42:28] understanding the godhead is very
[1:42:30] crucial but we will we will break some
[1:42:34] some uh scriptures here that we haven't
[1:42:37] heard and most we have heard but then
[1:42:40] from a different perspective at least it
[1:42:42] can solidify right our understanding of
[1:42:45] the godhead and why do we need to know
[1:42:47] the godhead and why do we need to be
[1:42:49] baptized the right way all all these
[1:42:51] things amen and uh we have we are one
[1:42:54] room Schoolhouse so bear with me if if
[1:42:56] it's two Elementary but then but then
[1:43:00] you know it's it's good to be
[1:43:02] reminded right because sometimes oh we
[1:43:06] thought that we already know but then
[1:43:08] there's there's more to it because
[1:43:10] Perfection means we have to know about
[1:43:13] the word amen the full word not partial
[1:43:15] word amen so let's uh let's just uh
[1:43:19] stand to our feet and uh read again uh
[1:43:23] scripture
[1:43:31] here Deuteronomy
[1:43:34] 6:4 here o Israel the Lord our God is
[1:43:39] one Lord may the Lord blessing of on the
[1:43:43] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:43:45] again
[1:43:47] amen
[1:43:49] so let's uh read some
[1:43:54] or let's have a little bit of study here
[1:43:57] so I have a lot of scriptures but then
[1:43:59] uh I didn't put them on the slid so at
[1:44:02] least it's not uh heavy heavily focused
[1:44:05] on slides but then as the Lord leads
[1:44:08] amen so we can see here in Deuteronomy
[1:44:12] 6:4 it's a basic thing that about the
[1:44:15] Oneness of the Lord right uh and
[1:44:19] uh if if it is in the Old Testament
[1:44:24] and because Jesus Christ never changed
[1:44:27] he's the same yesterday and today and
[1:44:28] forever we need to understand why there
[1:44:31] are so many doctrines about the godhead
[1:44:34] being one being two being three or being
[1:44:37] many or being none right but then for us
[1:44:41] we were taught very well by the prophet
[1:44:43] of this age that uh we have one God in
[1:44:49] three
[1:44:50] manifestations not three persons right
[1:44:53] right so so let's
[1:44:56] uh
[1:44:59] let's let us study it together amen so
[1:45:02] that there will be a good understanding
[1:45:04] amen so we can see here the Oneness of
[1:45:09] God in Isaiah 446
[1:45:13] brother so we can see the Bible teaches
[1:45:16] that God is one not three separate
[1:45:20] beings but one God man manifesting
[1:45:23] himself in different ways right so
[1:45:26] Isaiah 446 if you if you can put it
[1:45:32] up I'm I'm I'm trying to uh at least we
[1:45:35] can have a a good foundation so that we
[1:45:37] know the god that we worship it's
[1:45:41] difficult not to know is it the father
[1:45:43] is it the son is it the Holy Spirit but
[1:45:45] then at the end of the day if we have
[1:45:47] that uh understanding which is a mystery
[1:45:50] before then it will become a history to
[1:45:53] us and it will be one God right it's
[1:45:56] just one God but then manifested in in
[1:45:59] three different offices in three
[1:46:01] different roles right so Isaiah 446 thus
[1:46:06] said the
[1:46:07] Lord the king of Israel and his Redeemer
[1:46:12] the Lord of hosts I am the
[1:46:15] first and I am the last and beside me
[1:46:18] there is no God Amen so these are Good
[1:46:21] Foundations and then in in verse Isaiah
[1:46:27] 455 I will be a little bit slow so at
[1:46:30] least uh if you're taking notes at least
[1:46:31] you can you can study it again amen it's
[1:46:34] a especially if those who are not yet
[1:46:36] baptized the right way right we need we
[1:46:39] need to understand this it's not because
[1:46:42] your parent told told you or your
[1:46:45] parents told you that you need to be
[1:46:46] bapti you have to do it no you have to
[1:46:48] do it from your own volition
[1:46:51] understanding the the requirement amen
[1:46:54] and you need to be baptized the right
[1:46:56] way and what and and the importance of
[1:46:59] that name we need to know the name of
[1:47:01] the Lord amen so Isaiah 455
[1:47:05] brother I am the lord and there is none
[1:47:08] else there is no God beside me so you
[1:47:12] see so that's Oneness there is only one
[1:47:16] God and he has revealed himself through
[1:47:18] his word and his son Jesus Christ The
[1:47:20] Mighty God unveiled in paragraph 1
[1:47:23] before amen I I I even even the even the
[1:47:27] message uh quotes I we we won't be
[1:47:30] posting but then the thing is this all
[1:47:33] came from from the message amen and the
[1:47:36] scriptures amen so with that three
[1:47:41] manifestation maybe uh let's put it okay
[1:47:45] the father being God above us right I
[1:47:48] have a I have a uh
[1:47:53] you can put
[1:47:55] the the PowerPoint again brother so you
[1:47:58] can
[1:47:59] see this is a popular one because I I'm
[1:48:02] always preaching this uh but then the
[1:48:04] thing is you have to build on it so that
[1:48:07] there will be understanding and then uh
[1:48:10] when when you talk about it if like an
[1:48:13] appetizer you have to dig deeper into it
[1:48:15] and then stay with it right so you can
[1:48:18] see we're from eternity to Eternity and
[1:48:20] then there are important m Stones here
[1:48:23] but then we're talking about godhead so
[1:48:25] I will put the first one which is God
[1:48:28] about uh the the dispensation of the
[1:48:30] godhead the first one is God AB us which
[1:48:35] is the father dispensation and with the
[1:48:37] father
[1:48:38] dispensation we can maybe you can just
[1:48:41] open your Bibles here Malachi 2:10 you
[1:48:43] don't need to remove this here brother
[1:48:45] so that at least we can use our bibles
[1:48:47] if not then I will read it clearly
[1:48:49] anyway about the father God above us
[1:48:52] right Malachi
[1:48:56] 2:10 because we've been we've been
[1:48:59] pampered in not bringing our Bible
[1:49:01] sometimes because everything is there
[1:49:03] but we we need to to open also our
[1:49:06] Bibles right so at least we know where
[1:49:08] they are coming from amen Malachi
[1:49:11] 2:10 have we not all one
[1:49:15] father had not one God created us so you
[1:49:18] can see this father dispensation which
[1:49:20] is God above us is about the creat
[1:49:22] creation also he's the Creator amen and
[1:49:25] uh he wanted to to to to show us that uh
[1:49:30] he's the same God Amen at this time
[1:49:32] Jesus Christ is not
[1:49:34] there in the father dispensation Jesus
[1:49:37] because uh Jesus later on he became the
[1:49:39] son right so so that's Malachi 2:10 have
[1:49:42] we not all one father had not one God
[1:49:45] created us and then another vers is
[1:49:47] Isaiah 63:16
[1:49:53] sorry there will be a lot of verses yeah
[1:49:55] Isaiah
[1:49:58] 63:16
[1:50:00] doubtless Thou Art Our Father Isaiah
[1:50:04] 63:16 though Abraham be ignored of us
[1:50:08] and Israel acknowledge us not thou oh
[1:50:12] Lord art Our Father Our Redeemer thy
[1:50:17] name is from
[1:50:19] Everlasting amen so you can see so in
[1:50:22] the old Testament God was above his
[1:50:24] people in a pillar of fire guiding them
[1:50:28] he was known as Jehovah God the father
[1:50:31] of all creation amen so you can see the
[1:50:34] that's the fatherhood dispensation amen
[1:50:37] how about the son son's dispensation you
[1:50:40] can see sorry brother we will be
[1:50:42] flipping here and there so at
[1:50:45] least so that's the goded dispensation
[1:50:49] God above us the
[1:50:50] father and then now God with us which is
[1:50:54] the son right so let's let's uh read
[1:51:00] some ma Matthew Matthew 1:23 maybe you
[1:51:03] don't need to to to put the let let them
[1:51:08] read it in their Bibles brother so at
[1:51:10] least it can be
[1:51:16] shown Matthew 1:23 amen
[1:51:23] Behold a virgin shall be with a
[1:51:26] child or a virgin shall be with child
[1:51:29] and shall bring forth a son and they
[1:51:32] shall call his name Emmanuel which being
[1:51:36] interpreted is God With Us amen so
[1:51:40] that's Matthew 1:23 and in John
[1:51:43] 1:14 we know this and the Word was made
[1:51:46] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:51:49] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:51:51] begotten of the father
[1:51:53] full of grace and truth amen so we can
[1:51:57] see
[1:51:58] here God With
[1:52:00] Us in in in in in manifested in Jesus
[1:52:05] Christ amen before father and then now
[1:52:09] he's in the Sun so let's proceed here so
[1:52:11] that at least and then after that he is
[1:52:15] in the form of the Holy Spirit God in us
[1:52:18] amen so that's the Holy Ghost and you
[1:52:21] can see in John 14
[1:52:23] 14618 amen John 14:16
[1:52:27] to18 and I will pray the father and he
[1:52:31] shall give you another
[1:52:33] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:52:36] forever even the spirit of
[1:52:38] truth I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:52:42] will come to you Hallelujah so you can
[1:52:45] see
[1:52:47] here it's so important to know that uh
[1:52:50] it's in a dispensation it's it's like uh
[1:52:53] uh brother Branham explained it very
[1:52:56] well that uh God is like uh uh he and
[1:53:00] morphe he's changing mask amen right we
[1:53:04] we know all of this but what I'm saying
[1:53:06] is for those who who who who are not yet
[1:53:09] sold out with with what the Bible is
[1:53:11] saying we want to re reiterate it so
[1:53:14] that uh it will be clear for us so we
[1:53:17] have only one God in three
[1:53:19] manifestations right to to to simplify
[1:53:21] this godhead this dispensation right so
[1:53:24] it means it's just one God changing his
[1:53:26] mask in the Old Testament he's the
[1:53:28] father they're following him in the
[1:53:30] pillar of Fire by by night and pillar of
[1:53:33] cloud by day right he was the one who
[1:53:37] who uh who guided the Israelites
[1:53:40] wherever they go amen and uh you can see
[1:53:43] and then once that dispensation is done
[1:53:45] when Jesus Christ is here right he is
[1:53:49] God With Us amen right because he he was
[1:53:52] born but the reason why he he he came to
[1:53:56] that uh dispensation is because we know
[1:53:59] God is a spirit amen right and if if God
[1:54:04] is a spirit he cannot die right and we
[1:54:08] know that without shedding of blood
[1:54:09] there is no remission in Hebrews amen so
[1:54:12] that's the reason why he came as in the
[1:54:16] form of a flesh but that that that
[1:54:18] doesn't mean he is not God In the Flesh
[1:54:21] because it's the scripture that is God
[1:54:24] in flesh he dwelt Among Us John 1:14
[1:54:29] amen and then when he left before he
[1:54:33] left actually he told them I cannot send
[1:54:35] you the comforter while I'm here that's
[1:54:39] the reason why he has to go so that he
[1:54:40] can send another comforter which is the
[1:54:43] Holy Ghost that's why there's a holy
[1:54:46] ghost dispensation amen and that is in
[1:54:48] us right now amen which is so good amen
[1:54:52] uh just putting all this and then we
[1:54:54] will we will read more amen so you can
[1:54:57] see the
[1:54:59] father we call the Father the L Lord
[1:55:02] right uh Sarah called Abraham Lord amen
[1:55:07] and the son we call him
[1:55:08] Jesus and the Holy Ghost we call him
[1:55:11] Christ so the fullness of the godhead
[1:55:14] dwelleth in the Lord Jesus Christ bodily
[1:55:18] right Lord Jesus Christ godhead
[1:55:20] dispensation one God three
[1:55:22] manifestations not three persons like
[1:55:24] the trinitarians are are teaching
[1:55:27] because uh trinitarians they're saying
[1:55:29] there are three persons in one God you
[1:55:31] cannot have one God and then there are
[1:55:33] three persons distinct persons
[1:55:36] personality means it's a person right so
[1:55:39] it's the same God different roles
[1:55:42] different mask amen I hope that's clear
[1:55:44] enough I know it's it's clear for us but
[1:55:46] even the younger ones or who who who
[1:55:49] don't uh who don't read the Bible amen
[1:55:52] and you can see this uh wheel of
[1:55:55] Prophecy here whatever God is it's also
[1:55:59] Jesus so you see here this is a good
[1:56:02] tool actually when when you want to B to
[1:56:04] have Bible study in your devotions right
[1:56:07] for example here Jesus is coming 1
[1:56:10] Thessalonians
[1:56:11] 31-13 God is also coming you can see on
[1:56:14] the opposite side the complimentary
[1:56:16] thing here you can see they're all
[1:56:18] pointing to one God right God is the
[1:56:21] creator but Jesus also is the creator
[1:56:23] you see all the verses here in the Bible
[1:56:26] so this is like a summary so that we
[1:56:28] know when we study we know the god that
[1:56:31] we worship we know the god that we serve
[1:56:34] amen so it's important it's a teaching
[1:56:36] and and we know teaching places us so
[1:56:39] that we can have faith in what we
[1:56:40] believe
[1:56:41] amen so all this thing God is the REM
[1:56:46] Deemer and savior we we read that God
[1:56:48] the shepherd God the king God I am and
[1:56:52] the I am he God the first and the last
[1:56:55] God The Rock God is coming but then on
[1:56:57] the opposite sides of all of this is all
[1:57:00] Jesus so it's manifested in Jesus all
[1:57:03] these attributes of
[1:57:05] God attributes mean thought right we
[1:57:08] know God wanted to be a Healer be before
[1:57:12] everything else is Elohim right Elohim
[1:57:14] means self-existing one and with with
[1:57:17] him in his thought in his mind he wanted
[1:57:21] to be a father
[1:57:23] so it's how how can you be a father when
[1:57:25] you're alone right but then even before
[1:57:29] he wanted to be a father he wanted to be
[1:57:31] God but then God is an object of worship
[1:57:34] am right so no one else can worship him
[1:57:39] without him creating that's why he what
[1:57:41] what he did first he created angels so
[1:57:45] that the angels can worship him then he
[1:57:47] can be God Amen so the other attributes
[1:57:50] that he wanted to to manifest is to
[1:57:53] become a
[1:57:54] Healer right to become a Healer there
[1:57:57] should be sickness
[1:57:59] first right you cannot you cannot
[1:58:02] manifest the attribute of being a Healer
[1:58:04] which is him right by stripes we are
[1:58:07] healed right without without sickness
[1:58:10] that's the reason why we're we have
[1:58:12] sickness colds or whatever right
[1:58:14] whatever we have but then it's not only
[1:58:17] for healing it's for
[1:58:20] salvation by Stripes that that that uh
[1:58:25] uh death on the cross is not only for
[1:58:28] healing it's also for salvation amen and
[1:58:30] salvation is that's the healing of the
[1:58:33] Soul right so healing of the Natural
[1:58:36] Body and healing of the Soul so that's
[1:58:39] why for us we when we believe and we
[1:58:41] accepted the Lord Jesus Christ fully
[1:58:45] we're not afraid of
[1:58:46] death because whether we live or whether
[1:58:50] we die we are his we we know our
[1:58:53] destination right anything in between we
[1:58:56] know he's the Alpha and the Omega but
[1:58:58] who is the in between is also the same
[1:59:00] God that is in us right now to fulfill
[1:59:04] what he didn't finish amen because we
[1:59:06] have a we have a calling here we're not
[1:59:10] here because of coincidence Amen in his
[1:59:14] mind he he wanted to be a father that's
[1:59:18] why we are here he needs to create Sons
[1:59:20] and Daughters right so it's a you can
[1:59:23] say it's a masculine and feminine
[1:59:25] sometimes or it's a pair right if uh if
[1:59:28] there's a bridegroom there must be a
[1:59:30] bride if there is a father there must be
[1:59:33] Sons and Daughters if if if there's a
[1:59:35] king there's a queen and all this
[1:59:38] manifestations right if there is
[1:59:40] sickness there will be a Healer right if
[1:59:42] there is a mayor there will be
[1:59:44] constituents right if there is a judge
[1:59:46] there will be subjects uh there will be
[1:59:48] a throne uh uh judgment bar where where
[1:59:51] you will judge other people so you
[1:59:54] see all these attributes were manifested
[1:59:58] in Jesus Christ and then the bride and
[2:00:01] we're so thankful even being
[2:00:04] Sinners right we were made whole or
[2:00:08] because of his grace we are able to to
[2:00:12] to to manifest what he in his thoughts
[2:00:15] are amen so you see this wheel of
[2:00:18] Prophecy you we can have this if if you
[2:00:20] want I can send it to you and and uh
[2:00:23] these are very powerful scriptures and
[2:00:25] it's we don't need to reinvent the will
[2:00:27] that okay I will read the Bible uh cover
[2:00:30] to cover and which is good we need that
[2:00:34] but then what I'm saying is if if you
[2:00:35] have a topic that you wanted to to
[2:00:38] understand there are already men before
[2:00:40] us who who did the work right right if
[2:00:42] if you don't have much time to to do it
[2:00:44] but then at the end of the day we need
[2:00:46] to eat the full course meal we we just
[2:00:49] don't need to eat the appetizers right
[2:00:51] we we we need everything we need
[2:00:54] everything think of this uh uh for God's
[2:00:58] word right so it's just like in an all
[2:01:00] you can eat
[2:01:01] restaurant right right it
[2:01:05] is you pay one
[2:01:08] price but you have to you are able or or
[2:01:12] I mean you're allowed to get all the
[2:01:14] food that is serving that all you can
[2:01:16] eat right it will not be served to you
[2:01:19] right maybe they will serve drinks in
[2:01:22] some restaurants but then typically it's
[2:01:24] up to you who will ask or or who will
[2:01:27] take what food you will eat so think of
[2:01:31] that food like the promises in in the
[2:01:33] word of God right all the promises are
[2:01:37] here and they are available through
[2:01:39] Jesus Christ because he paid the price
[2:01:42] for All Things amen so that's why the
[2:01:45] book the promises here uh the promises I
[2:01:47] think baren gave us all all that book
[2:01:50] you can see if you're l L if you're
[2:01:52] angry if you have marital problem if you
[2:01:55] have Financial issues everything is
[2:01:58] there that's why this Bible brothers and
[2:02:00] sisters is enough for us to live not
[2:02:02] only to live naturally but spiritually
[2:02:06] until eternity amen so think of that all
[2:02:09] you can eat restaurant amen with all the
[2:02:12] promises of the Bible amen and that is
[2:02:15] already paid by Jesus Christ because of
[2:02:18] his blood amen so good to to understand
[2:02:22] and the the goodness of the Lord and He
[2:02:25] revealed it to us right through a
[2:02:29] through the Vindicated prophet of this
[2:02:30] age
[2:02:31] amen let's see the the next slide here
[2:02:35] and then uh we will break some of the uh
[2:02:39] the other uh verses that uh that are so
[2:02:42] good to to understand
[2:02:49] amen so Jesus Christ being everything
[2:02:53] because uh the fullness of the godhead
[2:02:56] dwelleth in him bodily right so when he
[2:03:01] came his first coming is to redeem his
[2:03:04] bride this is from birth to Calvary so 0
[2:03:09] ad to 33 ad amen that is his first
[2:03:13] coming his second coming is to catch
[2:03:16] away his bride which is the the Rapture
[2:03:18] that we're waiting for amen and we know
[2:03:20] we are already in the Rapture because uh
[2:03:23] when you accepted the message of the
[2:03:24] hour when you accepted the full word in
[2:03:27] its hour in its entirety you are already
[2:03:30] in the Rapture because you'll be changed
[2:03:32] from glory to glory as you feed right
[2:03:34] feeding the word means you will become
[2:03:36] the word we will become the word as we
[2:03:38] feed because we are what we eat amen if
[2:03:41] we feed if we feed social media we'll be
[2:03:43] like uh the rest of uh those who we
[2:03:46] follow amen so that's why we need to
[2:03:49] feed the word every Christian must feed
[2:03:51] the word of God and I'm guilty because
[2:03:53] uh we only feed sometimes uh
[2:03:56] intermittently but then it's it's
[2:03:58] required we have only two Services every
[2:04:01] week I've been telling this you think
[2:04:04] try to eat naturally two times a week
[2:04:07] let's see what happens to us right so we
[2:04:11] will be
[2:04:12] malnourished right so it's the same for
[2:04:14] the word of God if we will only eat when
[2:04:16] while we are here that's why the calling
[2:04:19] to us is to feed on the Bible right so
[2:04:22] that we will become the word right so
[2:04:24] that we will know his ways how can we
[2:04:26] know his ways if we don't fellowship
[2:04:28] with him right so I'm guilty uh I'm
[2:04:32] preaching to myself every time because
[2:04:34] uh every preacher must preach to
[2:04:36] themselves first right so that it it
[2:04:38] will manifest but then the thing is it's
[2:04:39] good to understand all those principles
[2:04:42] Amen to be to be caught away we need to
[2:04:45] mature amen because the Lord cannot
[2:04:48] marry an immature bride so we need to
[2:04:50] mature how can mature because at first
[2:04:53] when somebody witness to us then they
[2:04:56] will bring you to church right why so
[2:04:59] that they you will grow because
[2:05:01] spiritual growth go it's through the
[2:05:04] church through through the preaching of
[2:05:06] the word you cannot just be looking for
[2:05:08] people and then they have nowhere to go
[2:05:10] that's why we need the churches right
[2:05:12] the capital c church not only the the
[2:05:15] denominational churches we we're talking
[2:05:17] about the full church that believe the
[2:05:19] the full word of God Amen full go El so
[2:05:22] to catch away his bride that is his
[2:05:24] second coming and this is from
[2:05:27] Pentecost Pentecost means 50th day
[2:05:30] because after Jesus Christ was crucified
[2:05:34] and died and then he he resurrected
[2:05:37] after third day and on for 40 days
[2:05:40] together with the Old Testament Saints
[2:05:42] they were roaming around Jerusalem and
[2:05:44] uh showing themselves to people but then
[2:05:47] the thing is Jesus Christ gave the
[2:05:49] Commandment to to to the disciples
[2:05:52] to uh on what needs to be done and then
[2:05:56] the Holy Ghost came while they were in
[2:05:58] the upper room they were waiting for how
[2:06:00] many days 10 days right for 40 days
[2:06:04] Jesus Christ was with them and then uh
[2:06:07] uh he was teaching them what needs to be
[2:06:09] done and then on the uh he went to
[2:06:11] heaven he was raptured and then on the
[2:06:13] 10th day after 40 days and the and then
[2:06:17] the plus the 10th day then he came back
[2:06:19] in the form of the Holy Ghost that's the
[2:06:21] reason why it's called Pentecost 50th
[2:06:24] day right so 40 days he was on land or
[2:06:27] or on on Earth with the disciples and
[2:06:29] and some Believers and then within that
[2:06:31] 10 days they were waiting they were
[2:06:33] taring in Jerusalem in the upper room
[2:06:37] and that's very important because that's
[2:06:38] the Commandment from him T in in
[2:06:41] Jerusalem until you will be endured with
[2:06:44] power on
[2:06:45] high right so you see there's an
[2:06:48] importance in taring in waiting we
[2:06:51] cannot just think of our in our own mind
[2:06:53] we need the mind of Christ in making
[2:06:56] decisions right so we if we say oh uh as
[2:07:00] the Lord leads sometimes we don't
[2:07:03] understand what that
[2:07:04] means because we are already made we
[2:07:07] already made up our mind right when we
[2:07:09] when we pray to the Lord for his will we
[2:07:12] need to be
[2:07:13] neutral it means whatever whether left
[2:07:16] or right as long as it's the will of the
[2:07:18] lord we will follow it doesn't although
[2:07:20] sometimes of course we want this and
[2:07:22] this and this but then God God's answer
[2:07:25] is uh it's either yes no or wait right
[2:07:28] so it means it doesn't mean he didn't
[2:07:30] answer it means it's not good for us if
[2:07:33] if what we prayed for is not according
[2:07:35] to his will so that's why we need to be
[2:07:38] neutral every time amen and it's
[2:07:40] important to understand
[2:07:41] that so from Pentecost to the seven
[2:07:44] Church ages I know these are not brand
[2:07:48] new uh thing but then they are related
[2:07:50] to godhe that's why I I wanted to oops
[2:07:56] sorry the third coming is to reign with
[2:08:00] his bride in the Millennium so for a
[2:08:03] thousand years he will reign as king and
[2:08:06] we will be the
[2:08:07] queen but then being king and
[2:08:10] queen we cannot just rule without
[2:08:13] without uh subjects right so it mean we
[2:08:16] must have a domain that's why I know
[2:08:19] it's a deeper teaching here that there
[2:08:21] will be hens in the Millennium right so
[2:08:24] because uh it's also scriptural because
[2:08:27] you are king and queen and Millennium is
[2:08:29] not yet the the new heavens and new
[2:08:32] earth this is not eternity yet right
[2:08:34] this is 1,000 years meaning we are still
[2:08:36] in the element of time that's why being
[2:08:40] king and queen here is when you will
[2:08:43] come that's his third coming
[2:08:45] amen so let's see
[2:08:48] here just uh
[2:08:52] good uh representation of uh the cross
[2:08:55] of Calvary here before man and God are
[2:08:59] one but because of sin they were
[2:09:03] separated right so with this one just
[2:09:07] for easy representation so that we will
[2:09:09] understand we need the cross of Calvary
[2:09:12] so that man can be connected to God
[2:09:14] again amen and that's the reason why he
[2:09:17] came as a man the sun means it's a flesh
[2:09:21] God is veiled in flesh which is Jesus
[2:09:24] himself
[2:09:26] amen yeah so maybe let's uh let's digest
[2:09:30] it a bit so it's good sometimes uh
[2:09:33] pictures are better to to understand
[2:09:35] right so than than words
[2:09:38] amen we have 11 minutes okay if if we
[2:09:42] won't finish we'll somehow later on if
[2:09:46] there's a chance okay okay and then the
[2:09:49] other one
[2:09:53] God is a spirit and he that worship Him
[2:09:56] must Spirit uh must worship Him in
[2:09:58] spirit and in truth amen but then the
[2:10:01] thing is all that God was where did he
[2:10:05] pour into Christ think of this these are
[2:10:08] good graphics you won't find them in in
[2:10:11] uh in Google but you will find them
[2:10:14] maybe it will generate be generated by
[2:10:17] chat GPT
[2:10:22] all right but uh but the rest is all the
[2:10:25] revelation of God right so it's not we
[2:10:28] have to use the tools right amen we were
[2:10:31] that's why we're in golden age right so
[2:10:34] we have to use all the tools for his
[2:10:36] goodness sometimes we don't need to to
[2:10:38] write and then it will take you forever
[2:10:40] to to write something or you know so but
[2:10:43] be we're just using the proper tools
[2:10:46] amen but the Revelation comes from the
[2:10:48] Lord amen so think of this as a spirit
[2:10:51] but with a form right he doesn't have a
[2:10:53] form before he's a fountain of spirit
[2:10:55] amen and all that God was he poured it
[2:10:59] into Jesus Christ here amen so where is
[2:11:03] God now because that thing kenosis bar
[2:11:05] barberry in the unveiling of God he he
[2:11:08] explained that when you're trying to
[2:11:10] empty yourself it's not like emptying
[2:11:12] and then you're nothing you're still the
[2:11:14] same person that went to that or same uh
[2:11:19] same being that went into that right so
[2:11:22] he emptied himself he poured it into
[2:11:25] Christ so what where is God now so it's
[2:11:28] in Jesus Christ fully right that's why
[2:11:31] we're talking about Oneness also right
[2:11:34] so all that Christ was he poured it into
[2:11:38] the many membered body church right so
[2:11:42] you see so we we somebody I think
[2:11:45] Brother David someone yeah he and I I I
[2:11:49] mentioned that that it's just like like
[2:11:51] a fountain of water you will drink it
[2:11:54] right and then that spirit is in you
[2:11:56] already so it means all that God was he
[2:11:59] poured all of his Spirit he poured it
[2:12:01] into Jesus Christ that's why Jesus
[2:12:03] Christ is the fullness of the godhead
[2:12:05] bodily there's no other parallel that he
[2:12:08] poured into all right we have to go
[2:12:10] through that body right that son Jesus
[2:12:15] Christ before we can receive the Holy
[2:12:17] Ghost right so that's why God in spirit
[2:12:20] he poured into Jesus Christ the son and
[2:12:23] to many member body am amen so where is
[2:12:26] God
[2:12:27] now it's in us right so that's why God
[2:12:30] in us the hope of glory that's that
[2:12:34] simplifies everything amen
[2:12:42] oh this this the last but then the thing
[2:12:45] is let's let's break some scriptures
[2:12:47] here okay okay you can uh let's do this
[2:12:52] it's
[2:12:54] beautiful amen are you good I hope
[2:12:57] you're not uh uh bored there's not so
[2:13:00] many it's just yeah
[2:13:07] okay so water baptism the biblical way
[2:13:12] yeah we know most are already baptized
[2:13:15] but then some are not but then why maybe
[2:13:19] they yeah it's not understood yet yet or
[2:13:21] it's not yet time because God knows the
[2:13:23] time amen so in Mark 16:16 brother there
[2:13:27] will be a lot of verses okay and then uh
[2:13:30] I think we have time to to finish
[2:13:33] this Mark 16:16
[2:13:37] amen he that believeth and is baptized
[2:13:41] shall be
[2:13:43] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[2:13:45] D so you see we need to be baptized amen
[2:13:48] and in 1 Peter 3212
[2:13:58] to 1 Peter
[2:14:05] 32122 the like figure where unto even
[2:14:09] baptism do also now save us not the
[2:14:13] putting away of the filth of the flesh
[2:14:16] but the answer of a good conscience
[2:14:18] toward God by the resurrection of Jesus
[2:14:22] Christ and then 22 who is gone into
[2:14:25] heaven and is on the right hand of God
[2:14:27] angels and authorities and Powers being
[2:14:30] made subject unto him so you can see and
[2:14:34] then another one Matthew 28:19 and
[2:14:39] 20 and then we'll uh Matthew
[2:14:45] 28:19 we know this go ye therefore and
[2:14:49] teach All Nations baptized ing them in
[2:14:51] the name of the father and of the son
[2:14:53] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[2:14:55] observe all things whatsoever I have
[2:14:57] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[2:14:59] Always even unto the end of the world so
[2:15:01] Matthew 28:19 it says baptize in the
[2:15:04] name of the father and of the son and of
[2:15:06] the Holy Spirit but think of this is
[2:15:09] Father a son ah is Father a name is son
[2:15:12] a name is Holy Ghost a name no it's just
[2:15:16] like me saying I am the father of miles
[2:15:20] and Lynn
[2:15:21] right I am the husband of Faith but
[2:15:24] what's my
[2:15:25] name mvin right mvin and then my wife
[2:15:31] has no claim for me to be although she
[2:15:34] she calls me dad right but but then
[2:15:37] she's not my daughter right she's my
[2:15:39] she's my wife
[2:15:41] right that's how we call right Dad or
[2:15:43] Mom or but then the thing is that claim
[2:15:46] and and and and and Lyn and
[2:15:48] Miles uh don't have any claim for me to
[2:15:51] be the husband or wife right or the
[2:15:54] husband or or anything or grandfather so
[2:15:57] I'm I am mvin but I am a father I am a
[2:16:01] son also because I'm I'm the son of my
[2:16:04] my parents right but my name is mvin so
[2:16:07] let's go to acts 238 now so that we
[2:16:09] would know what the name of that father
[2:16:12] son and holy spirit amen in Acts 238
[2:16:16] brother these are basic ones but then
[2:16:18] let's put them together right so at
[2:16:21] least
[2:16:22] uh at least we are clear why why we're
[2:16:25] doing this because uh sometimes in
[2:16:28] preaching we only tackle it little but
[2:16:31] then the whole thing is is so important
[2:16:33] acts 238 then Peter said unto them
[2:16:36] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:16:39] in the name of Jesus Christ why for the
[2:16:43] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[2:16:46] the gift of the Holy Ghost remember this
[2:16:48] scenario in Acts 238 they just received
[2:16:50] the the Holy Ghost in Acts
[2:16:52] one and that is just 10 days because the
[2:16:56] Pentecost came after their meeting with
[2:17:00] Jesus Christ for 40 days that's why it's
[2:17:03] called Pentecost so 10 days you think 10
[2:17:05] days you you're that forgetful when he
[2:17:08] taught you all things right and then he
[2:17:10] even said the comforter will bring
[2:17:14] everything into your remembrance he will
[2:17:16] be your guide he will be your teacher
[2:17:19] that Holy Ghost when they receive the
[2:17:20] Holy Ghost do you think Peter did the
[2:17:22] wrong thing no and to prove the point
[2:17:26] also we know it's in it's in the message
[2:17:29] also there's $1
[2:17:30] million bet or or or reward for anyone
[2:17:34] who would say or or who can uh show in
[2:17:37] the Bible where anyone was baptized in
[2:17:41] the name of the father son Holy Spirit
[2:17:43] no one so that's a bold statement 1
[2:17:46] million that's long time ago so maybe
[2:17:48] it's already 1 billion now let's make it
[2:17:51] one trillion right to prove the point
[2:17:54] you cannot prove it in the Bible that
[2:17:57] anyone is baptized in the name of the
[2:17:59] father son holy spirit because the
[2:18:00] father is not a name son is not a name
[2:18:03] father is not a name it's an attribute
[2:18:05] it's it's it's a
[2:18:07] manifestation of the same God it's not
[2:18:10] three different persons right it's the
[2:18:13] same person amen Oh
[2:18:16] Glory so what will you do if you're not
[2:18:19] baptized the right way
[2:18:21] way so if because uh you know my
[2:18:25] testimony I was baptized three times
[2:18:27] first as a Catholic an infant and then
[2:18:30] in the Evangelical trinitarian way but
[2:18:33] then when they showed this to me oh my
[2:18:35] goodness I have to be baptized again the
[2:18:37] third time the right way because that's
[2:18:40] what the Bible said and it's in Acts 19
[2:18:43] Let's uh do that brother 191
[2:18:49] to5 let let's read it
[2:18:52] together so that you every everyone
[2:18:55] would know that if you're not baptized
[2:18:57] the right way you need to be re-baptized
[2:18:59] because even in the Bible let's read it
[2:19:02] and it came to
[2:19:05] pass that while Apollos what was at
[2:19:08] Corinth Paul having passed through the
[2:19:10] upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding
[2:19:13] certain
[2:19:15] disciples he said unto them have ye
[2:19:18] received the Holy Ghost since you
[2:19:19] believed
[2:19:22] and they said unto him we have not so
[2:19:24] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[2:19:26] Ghost and he said unto them unto what
[2:19:29] then were you baptized and they said
[2:19:32] unto John's
[2:19:34] baptism then said Paul John the Baptist
[2:19:39] verily baptized with the baptism of
[2:19:41] repentance saying unto the people that
[2:19:43] they should believe on him which should
[2:19:44] come after him that is on Christ Jesus
[2:19:48] when they heard this what did they do
[2:19:51] they were baptized in the name of the
[2:19:52] Lord Jesus so you see oh yes if you're
[2:19:55] not properly baptized because the
[2:19:58] Commandment is repent and be baptized in
[2:20:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[2:20:05] what for the remission of sins full
[2:20:07] forgiveness of sins and what will happen
[2:20:10] then and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost
[2:20:12] so you see following all the steps is
[2:20:16] mandatory amen and we need to know that
[2:20:19] name that we that we uh that we worship
[2:20:24] and that that importance of the name
[2:20:27] every knee shall bow every tongue shall
[2:20:29] confess amen that's why that name is
[2:20:32] important so let's uh let's read another
[2:20:34] scripture here as we are closing maybe
[2:20:37] I'll invite the musicians I'll I'll put
[2:20:39] uh yeah I still have a lot here but uh
[2:20:42] yeah I'll invite the musicians so at
[2:20:44] least we won't take so much let's see
[2:20:48] here good one
[2:20:53] okay John 11:25 brother and we we'll
[2:20:57] close on
[2:21:03] this John
[2:21:08] 11:25 Jesus said unto
[2:21:13] her I am the resurrection and the
[2:21:17] life he that believeth in me though he
[2:21:20] were dead yet shall he live so with this
[2:21:25] verse brothers and sisters he's saying
[2:21:28] right uh he's the
[2:21:31] resurrection so it means
[2:21:34] Resurrection is a
[2:21:36] person right so that
[2:21:41] means if Jesus Christ you can you can
[2:21:44] check the Bible it's it's a good study
[2:21:46] you will not find anyone in the Bible or
[2:21:50] or any instance in the Bible that Jesus
[2:21:52] Christ attended a
[2:21:55] funeral although very close is in uh uh
[2:21:59] but let's read it so at least we can
[2:22:00] close okay Luke 7:12 to15 let's read it
[2:22:05] brother Luke
[2:22:07] 72-15 these are three three instances in
[2:22:10] the Bible so that at least it will
[2:22:12] encourage us why why we we need to
[2:22:15] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ because
[2:22:17] he's the resurrection and the life amen
[2:22:20] so looks 72-15 this is the raising of
[2:22:22] the Widow's son at name
[2:22:25] okay okay 7:12 okay look 712 that's good
[2:22:30] now when he came nigh to the gate of the
[2:22:33] city behold there was a dead man carried
[2:22:35] out the only son of his mother and she
[2:22:38] was a widow and when the Lord saw her he
[2:22:42] had compassion on her Jesus had
[2:22:45] compassion on her and said unto her whip
[2:22:47] not and he came and touched the beer
[2:22:51] and he said young man I say unto thee
[2:22:55] arise and he that was dead set up and
[2:22:58] began to speak and he delivered him to
[2:23:01] his mother so Jesus encountered this
[2:23:04] funeral procession in and raised the
[2:23:07] Widow's son from the Dead showing his
[2:23:10] compassion and power over death am so
[2:23:13] you see because he's the resurrection
[2:23:15] and the life they cannot come mingle
[2:23:17] death and life cannot come mingle right
[2:23:19] it's just like
[2:23:21] uh light and Shadow cannot or light and
[2:23:23] dark light and darkness cannot commingle
[2:23:26] one should go away amen so the power of
[2:23:28] death Jesus Christ has that power the
[2:23:31] second one the raising of Jus da
[2:23:35] daughter we're just putting this as a
[2:23:38] single scripture pointing to different
[2:23:40] scriptures so that we would know that uh
[2:23:43] a resurrection is a person the life is a
[2:23:46] person he's the way the truth and the
[2:23:48] life right so amen so let's read Mark
[2:23:52] 538 to 42
[2:23:55] summarized Mark
[2:24:00] 538 okay and he come to the house of the
[2:24:03] ruler of
[2:24:06] synagogue and seeth the T tumult and
[2:24:09] them that wept and wailed greatly and he
[2:24:14] was and when he was coming he said unto
[2:24:17] them why make you this ado and Weep the
[2:24:21] Dum cell is not dead this is Gyro's
[2:24:23] daughter but sleep it and he took the
[2:24:26] Dum cell by the hand and said unto her
[2:24:29] talita
[2:24:31] Kumai that means
[2:24:35] uh that means I say unto thee arise amen
[2:24:40] and what
[2:24:41] happened and straight way the damel
[2:24:44] arose and walked amen Jesus was called
[2:24:48] to the home of gyus whose daughter had
[2:24:51] died despite the morning Jesus raised
[2:24:54] her from the dead displaying his
[2:24:56] authority over life and then the last
[2:25:04] one the rising of Lazarus this is the
[2:25:07] very closest one that is uh like a
[2:25:10] because he was already buried for 3 Days
[2:25:14] right four days buried for 4 days but
[2:25:17] God is never late in his appointments
[2:25:19] amen he's for this late but he's still
[2:25:22] on time let's read it John 11:38
[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:33] brother
[2:25:35] 1138 okay Jesus therefore again groaning
[2:25:38] in
[2:25:39] himself cometh to the Grave it was a
[2:25:41] cave and a stone lay upon
[2:25:45] it Jesus said take ye away the stone
[2:25:49] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[2:25:51] said unto him Lord by this time he
[2:25:55] stinet for he had been dead four
[2:25:58] days Jesus said unto her said I not unto
[2:26:02] thee that if thou wouldest believe thou
[2:26:05] shouldest see the glory of
[2:26:07] God then they took away the Stone from
[2:26:10] the place where the dead was laid and
[2:26:12] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father
[2:26:15] I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and
[2:26:19] I knew that thou hearest me always but
[2:26:21] because of the people which stand by I
[2:26:23] said that they may believe that thou
[2:26:25] Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken
[2:26:28] he cried with a loud voice loud voice is
[2:26:31] a shout brother and that loud voice is
[2:26:34] the voice of the resurrection and he
[2:26:36] called what Lazarus come Fort he has to
[2:26:39] call his name otherwise all the Sleeping
[2:26:41] Saints will come
[2:26:43] up and be resurrected so in this in this
[2:26:46] time it's not yet time for for for for
[2:26:49] for the whole uh Humanity to to
[2:26:52] resurrect amen so that's why he he
[2:26:54] called his name Lazarus come forth and
[2:26:56] then what
[2:26:57] happened and he had and he that was dead
[2:27:01] came forth bound hand and foot with
[2:27:04] grave clothes and his face was bound
[2:27:06] about with a napkin Jesus said unto them
[2:27:09] lose him and let him
[2:27:12] go then Mar of the Jews which came to
[2:27:14] Mary and had seen the things which Jesus
[2:27:17] did believed on him Brothers you can see
[2:27:21] here that uh the presence of the Lord
[2:27:24] Jesus Christ is
[2:27:26] life death and life cannot coexist amen
[2:27:30] and I will put this even further for the
[2:27:34] Bride of this last age we can have the
[2:27:37] same Greater Works as what Jesus
[2:27:40] did we because we we can impart eternal
[2:27:44] life that's what it is when we're trying
[2:27:46] to witness to somebody we're trying to
[2:27:48] impart eternal life
[2:27:50] right because even you are dead in this
[2:27:53] flesh yet you will live because Jesus
[2:27:57] Christ the Lord Jesus Christ the name of
[2:27:59] the god that we
[2:28:01] serve right is the way and he is the
[2:28:05] truth and is the life amen all into it
[2:28:09] it's a person that's why where where is
[2:28:12] God right now in us with all the things
[2:28:15] that we have just shown here he's living
[2:28:17] in us that's why we have a very uh big
[2:28:22] responsibility here on Earth brothers
[2:28:23] and sisters right to impart eternal life
[2:28:26] is our duty to to to all our friends to
[2:28:32] all our colleagues to our to all our
[2:28:34] families but then the thing is that's
[2:28:37] the the essence of knowing who God Is
[2:28:41] Right which is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:28:43] knowing who we are and we have the the
[2:28:46] Oneness with the Lord at that day you
[2:28:49] shall know
[2:28:50] that God is in me I in you and you in me
[2:28:54] the Oneness of God with the bride amen
[2:28:57] with the with the church amen God bless
[2:29:00] you richly I know it's a little bit
[2:29:02] short because we have the the missions
[2:29:04] report but then yeah less is much when
[2:29:07] when we have all all these things
[2:29:09] together amen I hope you are encouraged
[2:29:11] and and uh let's uh let's Worship the
