have gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday father as we look at the calendar this morning Lord the week of the or the day rather doesn't say Easter but Lord in the hearts of every believer here is stamped Easter oh God Lord because we don't just honor your Resurrection Lord one day out of the year but Lord your Prophet said every day to the believer is Easter Lord what a resurrection that that was but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus now Lord this morning as we're coming here today Father Lord pushing against Spirits oh God lord battling the enemy as Warriors but Lord we stand here this morning as Victorious Lord we're not defeated oh God but we're V Victorious this morning Father we're asking you this morning to send Grace into the building father Lord you seen every hand that was raised behind that hand there is a need and Lord I'm asking you this morning may you come Among Us oh God in the power of your Resurrection Lord father I pray the hand of the enemy would be stopped this morning Lord I pray that healing would come into sick bodies oh God I pray encouragement would come into discouraged hearts Lord I pray

along the way so Lord we're committing this meeting today into thy faithful hands in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen amen and amen we want to say God bless you all this morning amen if you have your Bibles today we want to turn in the scripture to the Book of Luke The Book of Luke the 16th chapter amen The Book of Luke the 16th chapter amen we have a few places we would like to to read this morning amen and while you're turning there today we do want to say Amen it has been a real honor amen and a privilege to be here with you all once again and amen I pray that these uh meetings are being a blessing to you amen and an encouragement to you in your walk with the Lord amen and I know this morning the Lord amen has something for us today amen we want to say we appreciate brother Barry Sister Lisa the family God bless you all amen we do thank the Lord for the privilege to get to know him and to Fellowship here in Calgary and then I I do want to say this morning we bring a greetings from our pastor brother Shawn Martin there the Saints at Faith Tabernacle send their greetings to you as well as brother Wayne Lawson told me to be sure and greet you all for him we were just there with them uh last week for their youth camp there in Ohio so we want to be sure and greet you for brother Wayne and brother Ray and the church there amen and it is a an honor here to have sister Susan and sister Trudy here with us God bless you all amen friends of ours and the weep family there and amen I was just thinking this morning amen of those meetings several years ago there and man and tolda how the Lord just came down and used those meetings in a special way and amen it is a I don't know about you but I I am excited Amen to serve the Lord amen I don't know the world gets excited about sports and they get excited about all the activities of Le osia amen but to the believer we get excited about the Lord amen I don't know I don't ever want to lose that fervor amen or that enthusiasm Amen to serve the Lord amen The Book of Luke the 16th chap chapter we want to look here in the 16th verse amen the Bible here says that the law and the prophets were until John but since that time the kingdom of God is preached somebody say preached preached it's not played but preached the kingdom of God is preached now watch this and every man presseth somebody say presseth presseth into it so there is a preaching amen and then there is a pressing the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it now I want to go to the book of Philippians the third chapter Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 and I want to read there in the 13th verse I know this is another uh very familiar reading Philippians chapter 3 and verse number 13 Paul here writing in Philippians 3 and verse 13 he says now Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before so there are some things behind us but Paul says to forget those things that are behind us and let us reach forth unto those things which are before now watch this he says so I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it but here Paul says amen that we got to forget some things that are behind us and we've got to press toward the things that are in front of us now in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 I want to read one verse there in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 13 and I want to ask you this question amen how do we press amen and how do we press in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 13 I believe we will find the answer he says now we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken now watch this we also believe and therefore we speak so we actually press forward by believing the things that have been spoken amen or preached unto us amen how many he says this morning Lord I want to go forward amen I want to move forward we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing Amen to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today amen I want you by the help of the Lord for amen just a few moments this morning I actually uh was planning to go a whole different direction amen continuing in our thought from last night but the Lord just changed things on me so amen if it's okay we'll just follow him amen but I want to speak to you this morning Amen on the brides breakthrough amen the brides break through you know I believe amen that the time has come amen for the Believers to press amen I believe the time has come amen for the Believers to press amen and that is to press forward amen amen not to go backwards amen not to go to the left or to the right but to press forward now the prophet of God would say we all have to work together as one Unity see amen we have to get our differences away we have to lay aside our doctrines and things amen and put our arms together amen and press forward and take the promise amen that God Almighty has given us amen how many would agree that we have been given promises amen but they're not natural promises amen but they are Divine promises amen then if they are Divine promises then we are under amen a Divine commission to possess amen those Divine promises brother B said a man amen that's commissioned of God Amen he looks up Ward and he looks onward amen he doesn't look backwards and he doesn't look downward amen but he looks upward and he looks onward see you don't have to care what the world says about it anyhow amen he's not listening to the world Amen he's got a Divine commission from God Amen and he is enjoying that presence you know I believe this morning that we are enjoying amen the presence or the company amen of the Holy Ghost now I believe the Holy Ghost how many amen how many believes in the Holy Ghost amen you believe in the Holy Ghost amen so you believe that the Holy Ghost comes among the church amen then when the Holy Ghost comes among the church amen he's coming to do more than just excite us amen he's coming to do more than just make us feel good or amen give us a little sensation or a little emotion amen but the Holy Ghost is coming among the church to make the church amen persever it now you know what perseverance means amen it means to be persistent Amen to make a goal brother said a man that's ever amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believed in God they had faith in God and they stood against the enemy Amen on every side now you all will agree amen that the enemy is coming in like a flood right amen but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood amen that the spirit of the Lord amen will raise a standard against the enemy he said and was perseverant because they believed in God he said then I believe amen that every Christian therefore amen should be very perseverant amen another place as long as a Christian can know that he's living above sin and the Holy Spirit is blessing him and standing with him then be perseverant amen and press towards the mark of the High Calling amen Christians should be that way they should be very perseverant in their claims to God Amen stay with it listen I think it's time Amen to get some perseverance back in the church I think it's time to get some perseverance back in our prayers I think it's time to get some perseverance back in our preaching you all remember amen that we used to not just lay down so easily to the devil amen when the devil threw something against us we didn't just back up and say well amen I guess this is the way it'll be I guess the devil will have his way amen but we used to have prayer Warriors amen they would get together and pray till things change amen they would pray till Spirits broke amen they would believe God till Faith come in the room and you know what I say I say our young people should not be handed amen a secondhand religion they should not be handed another idea amen or another cold Creed amen I say oh God bring some fire back in the church amen bring some perseverance back Among Us amen bring the oldfashioned Holy Ghost amen that'll Shake us from the floor Amen to the ceiling amen that'll bring reality in the church now amen I know amen some people get a little bit cold and intellectual amen and they get all wed up when you start preaching Amen on the moving of the Holy Ghost amen but you're looking at one preacher amen that will not lay down the teaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen for some intellectual devil that wants to rob the church amen of the reality of Jesus Christ listen there is a true God and there is a false god amen and the false god is a God Amen of this evil age and he will lead you into the depths of Satan amen but there is a true God and he is Jehovah and he is a living God he is a breathing God he is a moving God he is a God that will take the church amen forward in every Divine promise I say we are not just pressing amen or putting our efforts together in vain amen but we are pressing amen towards the mark amen of the High Calling amen if you can turn these up and give me more on the floors I'd appreciate it as Paul said amen I could stand quoting again amen forgetting those things that are in the past amen now I press towards the mark amen of the High Calling watch to the complete identification amen so we're not just pressing amen towards a partial identification amen but we are pressing towards a complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity amen when Jesus comes another place he says we're not going to have amen a rearview mirror Affair he said a rearview mirror only looks back and sees where you have been he said but we're looking forward Amen to see where we are going listen We're Not Looking Back to see that we have been in justification or that we have been in sanctification or that we have been in the baptism amen of the Holy Ghost but we're looking forward Amen to the Rapture of the church we're looking forward to the body change we're looking forward to the resurrection amen don't look through a rearview mirror amen 40 years ago amen look what is tonight amen look what the scripture amen is promising today he did promise them in that day but we're living on above there now amen we are going on Amen look at somebody next to you and say let's go on Amen let's go on let's go beyond depression amen let's go Beyond confusion amen let's go beyond the past amen let's go beyond last year amen or two years ago listen some of you all have settled down amen that this is as far as you can go amen and you can't go no higher and you can't go no deeper amen but I come by here this morning Amen to say that devil is a liar he was a liar from the beginning and his truth is not abiding in him if there is a seed in your soul that you are a part amen of the Seed of Abraham and when God called Abraham out he said as the sand of the sea and as the stars of the sky amen so shall th seek me listen friends there is no limit on this bride there is no limit on this message there is no limit on this anointing we are not preaching from a broken syst we are preaching from an RT and well there is unsearchable riches there is untapped resources there are blessings Beyond imagination but you got to get up and you got to go beyond this cold amen idea that I've gone as far as I can go listen there are higher Heights amen there are deeper depths there are more realities and we'll only get there by pressing amen amen sometimes you got to press amen now come on Amen I'm preaching to you this morning sometimes you got to press sometimes the only way that you can take another step is press we got any humans here this morning amen any humans are we all Angels amen as a human you know some days amen you don't feel like you can put one foot in front of the other amen listen amen you all can look back today and you can see trials you can see things you went through and the devil convinced you you can't go no further amen but here you are two years down the road or you're 3 years down the road amen or you're 10 years down the road amen do you know how you got here because there was something in youen that caused you to begin to press you said I may not feel like it I'm going to pray anyhow I may not feel like it but I'm going to worship anyhow I may not sense it but I'm going to believe God anyhow and you begin to press and you begin to press because the kingdom of God is preached amen listen I am here this morning under a Divine Commission of Mark 16 Amen to preach the kingdom of God you are here this morning as the seat of God Amen to believe what's being preached and to press into it listen that word pressive it means to use and apply Force so when you press against something you don't just say move when it don't move you apply Force now listen what the Bible said every man amen presses into it brother says not just simply walks into it easily oh my but it's got to be pressed into it now see you know what desperation does Amen is desperation causes you Amen to press somebody say desperation it causes you to press now I love what the prophet says he says the law and the prophets were until John amen but since then amen the Kingdom of Heaven has been preached and Men press into it you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar Lord and push me in no you press into it see you get desperate it's between life and death listen listen amen when you get tired of just going to church amen and going through the motions amen and being a good church member amen and just paying your ties amen amen I I'm I'm preaching to you when you get tired of that amen then there comes a strength Amen to begin to press into Revelation I believe this morning that we are following amen a Vindicated Prophet how many will agree that brother R was a Vindicated Prophet now you believe that he could see amen into other dimensions you hear him on table he'll say like this I see a black streak and it's here and it's going over there he said then it's going back there amen he said now right there's a streak of cancer he said it's like streaks going back and forth he said now watch he said those demons are crying out for hell so he identify those black streaks amen as demons which are negative now let me say this I don't believe amen that he could just look and see it in the negative amen but I believe he could see the positive too I believe he could look into a congregation and he could see a cancer or he could see a heart trouble or he could see a marriage issue or amen or immorality amen he could look and see those things but listen brother mvin I believe that he could see the positive as well because he had the Divine ability Amen to see things that would get the people to believe amen that there was a possibility for the situation to change and they were facing 1950 in a sermon called so is the father and it suffices us he said don't doubt amen just have faith to believe he said and I believe God Amen is going to give us a breakthrough tonight he said I believe amen it's on the audience oh God Amen he can see a cancer he can see a heart trouble he can see a nervousness he can see a sin listen if he can see the negative hey I believe he can see the positive if he could see the spirit that was oppressing the life if he could see the spirit amen that was binding the church I believe he could see the Breakthrough that was upon the people Amen to break out of the condition listen I may be as crazy as you ever thought I am this morning but I think it's time to have a breakthrough I think it's time Amen to break out a form I think it's time to break out a tradition I think it's time to break out a ritualistic worship I think it's time to break out into a dimension with God where we can believe God in the face of every obstacle we can walk like Enoch we can pray like David we can dance like David we can shout we can preach this message I think it's time for a good oldfashioned [Music] breakthrough I think it's time to bring the fire of God Amen back on the altars I think it's time to tear down intellectualism and lift up spiritual Revelation I believe there's a breakthrough listen that was more than just a prophet thank you that was a prophecy he's looking at you and he's saying I see a breakthrough now the prophet was not speaking by the word of a man brother bar he was speaking by the word of faith in Romans chapter 10:8 but what saith it amen the word is nigh thee it is even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith amen oh my the word of faith which we preach so the kingdom of God is preached the word of faith and every man presseth into it look at this word preach it means to publish it means to Proclaim openly it means to be a Herald with the authority which must be listened to and Obey listen it's something which has been done so when you begin to preach the word of Faith you are preaching that what I'm saying has already been done somebody say well why are you preaching about a breakthrough because there's already been one and if there's already been one that means there can be another one listen friends some of you all have had breakthroughs many times amen listen that ought to give you the courage right here this morning to say if I had a breakthrough a year ago or two years ago or 6 months ago that right here this morning the same God that gave me that breakthrough is Hebrews 138 he's Ecclesiastes 3 he's Malachi 3:6 he's the unchanging God and what he did before he's able to do again brother said I must preach the kingdom of God he said I must preach the truth amen regardless of how it hurts amen or what it hurts amen now sometimes when you preach amen you got to hurt some Spirits you got to hurt some devils you got to hurt the feelings of some demons I tell you what we've done we've quit preaching the gospel and we put on a pair of gloves and we've started trying to counsel Devils out of the church amen and psychology Devils out of the church but I say take the gloves off this morning amen and look that devil square in the face and say devil you've gone as far as you're going to go you've taken as much as you're going to take you've stolen as much as you're going to steal there is an anointing by the word of faith listen I'm not believing a man's idea I'm believing thus sayith the Lord and the prophet of God said listen we must preach that word until every devil backs up now I'll say this we must preach the word of faith said see amen Paul writes to Timothy now somebody say what is amen the identifying characteristic of a Ministry well Timothy says preach the word amen preach the word you be instant in season out of season you reprove you rebuke you exhort amen with all longsuffering and Doctrine he said now listen I want my friends both here and out in the lands where these tapes will go amen the reason I have stood that I have heard the word in the very reason preached the word he said that's the reason I would not Tate amen with any Creeds and any denominations amen because I have been commissioned Amen to stay with the word I say God sends his word amen by anointed preachers in Romans 10:14 it says how then shall they call on him in who they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher now watch and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful amen are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord amen who has believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing by the word of God Amen so the faith that cometh into your heart amen it cometh by hearing the word somebody say this morning brother Andrew I ain't got no faith well you're in the right place amen because I can stand here today and say faith cometh amen Faith cometh amen Faith cometh to the hearing of the word of God said then you can only serve God on Earth see amen as God's servants that sent on Earth amen by divine inspiration interprets the word to you another place a few years ago when the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost before it came and the church began to get formal amen back in the days of Methodist and you people cried to God for deliverance amen and God sent down amen the baptism of the spirit amen now since then amen since then people has been liberated from their sin amen by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the liberating power to the church amen is the receiving of the Holy Ghost he said now those who do not believe in it they cannot receive it see you've got to believe in it therefore he sent anointed preachers Amen to preach the word amen and you received it listen I am preaching amen the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost amen I am preaching the word of faith that'll change your body in the moment in the twinking of an ey listen you've got to receive the word and as you receive the word you become the word I love what the prophet says he said Christ does not anoint ministers Amen to preach the gospel amen just to have it returned back to him void amen but he expects you Amen to receive the word and then receiving the word amen be ready amen be ready for the manifestation of the word that you're receiving listen what good does it do to preach that there's a God Amen who can heal your body amen and you not believe that the word being preached amen can actually manifest in the very service that you're hearing at pre him come on church anden let me say this as plain as I know how we're living in a special time amen we're living in a season amen where the farmer rain and the latter rain are falling together we're living in a season amen where the Bible says amen that the Reapers amen that the that the the sers will catch up with the Reapers amen listen we're living in a season where a prayer request amen can be a prayer request at the beginning of the service and at the end of the service it can be a testimony amen because there is a God who has come among the church by the preaching of the kingdom of of God listen there is somebody that's going to hear this word there is somebody going to receive this word listen I'm not a crazy man amen I've seen it with these eyes I've seen women come in prayer lines with their husbands out on alcohol am been the bills piling up they been the home falling apart the baby starving and say God I need my husband to come home and in 30 minutes I watch the drunk man come staggering down the aisle amen come off the street and give his heart back to God listen have we so settled down amen and received the idea amen that God don't move no more and the supernatural don't happen I stand here today and I defy that devil in the name of Jesus Christ I renounce that devil I give that devil no room in this church amen to torment our minds I say bring back the preaching of the word of faith until a reality breaks out in the heart Hallelujah I believe it's a season where Miracles are happening it's a season amen where things are transpiring God sent his word we have been taught amen that we get what we expect right come on church amen we get what we expect are you hearing me amen do you realize sometimes a preacher has got to push the word out there amen but you got to pull come on now amen I remember one time I was in a meeting and a guy come to me he said man I ain't never heard that brother preach like that before I said well you probably ain't never pulled like that before and then and then somebody told me one time they said they they they heard their pastor preaching a meeting and they said man we ain't never heard him preach like that I said well go home and pull like they were pulling you'll hear him at home come on I me we don't just get up here to tell you what we thought about over the week amen this is more than a service amen this is a joint effort amen this is a man preaching the word amen but it's you pulling on the word y y'all know what y'all know what a lumber mill is amen you take a log down there y'all know what that is take a log down there amen I remember one time as a kid amen my grandfather took me over to a sawmill and we had a big old log he was going to get cut up into tues so we go in this Sawmill and they lay this great old big log out and the guy asked me he says young man have you ever seen a log saw I said no I've heard about them he said you know how they work I said well I think so he said well here I'll show you so he takes this great old big long saw and brother Barry on one side has got a handle and on the other side has got a handle and he gets on this side and there's a guy on that side of the pull pit I mean on that side of the log and he pushes that saw across there and that guy pulls it and then when that guy pushes it back he pulls it back that way now about halfway through it though amen that guy just got tired went somewhere so the guy on this side had to push it over there then he had to run over there and push it back amen amen listen it was going to take twice as long amen if only one man was pushing amen but when you get two man one's pushing one's pulling amen you're going to cut that long well listen friends we need more than just two amen we need the preacher on the platform but we need the Believers in the pews but the most thing we need is the anointing of the Holy Ghost to come down in the church listen amen as the man of God preaches you begin to pull on that word you begin to exert force on that word you begin to say speak to me Lord show me your will show me your face reveal to me the situ situation bring the power of God into my life and as you begin to pull on God the anointing begins to build listen I want to say this morning amen the devils are dying here today Spirits are breaking here today because there is a word of faith that has returned to the church and we are not playing with it we are preaching it somebody shout preach the word prach the word amen I know the devil come among the church and said holler and amen is Pentecostalism well you're looking at one preacher that says that's a lie I said that's a lie amen the Pentecostals don't have no right Amen on shouting amen the word amen was in the Bible because the Bible is the because the Bible says that Jesus is the amen of God and a Prophet come along and he said amen means so be it he said amen stands for finality he said amen means it has been spoken amen thus shall it be listen you know what I say I say make amen's great again in the house of God Amen when the preacher says the word amen don't sit there like a bump on a pickle amen trying to filter the word through your intellectual filter amen Release Yourself Amen to the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and say Amen brother Barry amen preacher Amen brother mvin Amen brother kill that ain't nothing but the truth hey amen the word of God and watch Devils begin to back up watch spirits begin to break watch word become literally manifested before you somebody's going to preach it somebody's going to preach it and somebody's going to believe it in Mark 16 Jesus said they shall preach the gospel they shall cast out devils in my name and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover can I say something to you the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil amen when you begin to preach the gospel it is the casting out of the devil so if I was the devil I would fight the preaching of the Gospel too amen hello let me ask you something amen amen when the music going do you have a hard time staying awake hello when the singing's going deep does the devil fight you to get into the singing does the devil fight you to get into the music does the devil fight you to stay awake in a in a oh God does the devil fight you to stay awake in a special no but when the word begins to preach amen begins to be preached is when the Devil comes in and your mind gets on this and your mind gets on that amen you know why because the devil knows amen that the singing of the songs of Zion is the creating of an atmosphere amen for the word of God to come forth in and the devil knows when the word begins to be preached amen and the power and the demonstration of the spirit amen the hold he's got on you is going to be broken because the preaching of the Gospel is going to cast out the devil you know what I say I say let's get back to preaching until every devil gets uncomfortable let's get back to preaching until every Spirit gets uncomfortable listen I think we ought to preach until we make nervous Devils nervous I think we ought to preach until we make depression Devils commit suicide and go back to hell where they come from yes sir I tell you what you're not a son of suicide you don't belong to depression you don't belong to anxiety you don't belong to false Doctrine you belong to almighty God and if there is a devil that is trespassing on God's Property then we have a right this morning to say thou demon of unbelief thou demon of suicide thou demon of sickness thou demon of depression take your hands off of God's Property we need a breakthrough I said we need a breakthrough we need to get the on the idea we've gone as far as we can go listen I know what the devil does he puts that oh God I'm getting ahead of myself brother I'm sit believe in God he says God has given me the authority Amen to break the power of Satan another place you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ see then we are in a great spiritual Warfare said now there's only one thing me can I take a moment and read this to you he said there's only one thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old he said see because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little longer that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability see a spirit you got with a crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you but you wanted to do right see there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right but there's something amen that won't let you do right is that right now watch a prophet identified that's the devil my goodness that's the devil but watch what he says but he commissioned his church amen to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils now listen you ain't going to heal nobody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept amen they healing that's already been done preacher stood on the platform I love this amen preacher stood on the platform and they preach the gospel and devil scatter the man come to the altar under conviction and say I want to get saved he never saved the man he just cast out the devil and the man got saved he come and accepted his salvation he said the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe that have been born again and are sons and Daughters of God then Christ has already healed you come on church amen you got a baby out of the Covenant of Grace let me say this God's already saved that baby come on you got a child away from God he's already save that child you got a spouse away from God he's already saved that spouse but there's a spirit hanging over them that's trying to convince them amen that they're not good enough come on right now I'm in a spiritual warfare amen because there Spirits right here amen gathering together and saying don't say that this person don't like this oh y'all know what I'm talking about amen but we're not a bunch of sissies we're not a bunch of cowards we refuse to give place to the devil when that devil rears his ugly head we're going to stand on the say of the Lord we're going to stand on Mark 16 we're going to take an atomic bomb and say the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition I say this morning put on you kicking shoes and kick the devil out kick him out of your church kick him out of your home kick him out of your prayer life kick him out of your family kick that devil out this morning and bring back the liberty of the Holy Ghost a spiritual [Music] warfare somebody say well I'm going to sit on you well enjoy it you're in for a bumpy ride you can't sit on this anointing it's a spirit it's a devil and it hangs over people brother said the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you are y'all hearing me that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise so here is you and out there is the promise of God but between you and that promise is a spirit and it's a spirit of Oppression and it hangs over over people and says you can't go out there now now come on Friends amen I know people get tore up about this but let's just preach demons are real spirits are real brother said see sometimes demons won't move without a force and he said the force that moves the devil is the power of Faith now watch this he said that's right but that's what God gave me it's what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him amen the power and the authority to break the spirit listen friends can I say this this morning if there is a spirit hanging over you brother Barry if there is a spirit amen hanging over Living Word assembly if there is a spirit hanging over any of you this morning can you hear my heart that Spirit don't have a right to stay come on if there's a spirit hanging over you that Spirit don't have a right to stay brother that Spirit don't have a right to torment you it don't have a right to control you listen right now that spirit is controlling some of your praise cuz you want to break out so bad and enjoy the anointing come on I'm just going to preach a little bit since I flew all the way up here and then sometimes somebody gets to shouting and somebody sitting there looks at him and says oh they're just worked up they're just emotional they're just trying to be seen no let me tell you what that is that's really not you that's saying those things it's a spirit hanging over you that's influencing your faults about a person who's had a breakthrough but can I say this am been the same God that gave that person a breakthrough and broke the spirit over their life amen can break the spirit over your life and you can break out in that same Dimension y'all know what I'm talking about a a amen oh God it'd be like this morning amen Benjamin here and his brother Christopher amen it'd be like Christopher sitting there amen the spirit hanging over him hanging over him amen don't enjoy the anointing amen amen I tell you amen it just blesses my heart to see this fell up here amen Amen on fire for God somebody say well I think you ought to be sitting down amen I think somebody ought to join him he could be at a bar or he could be at a ball game but he's in the house of God enjoying the word of God say well he's too young amen tell me what age limit is on this anointing there is no age limit amen John was a baby in his mother's womb when he received the Holy Ghost Josiah was 12 years old when he told pour down the idols in the temple I say get up this morning and break that spirit and be what God called you to be break that devil this morning step out in faith step out in Authority believe God one time believe his word one time trust him one [Applause] time my goodness Spirit hang over amen amen be like brother brother Christopher sitting here in the spirit hanging over him as a young boy and it's saying amen uh I can use these two examples cuz when we leave they'll still be brothers and it's like a spirit hanging over there and that Spirit hanging over him and it's saying you're too young you're too young to enjoy this you're too young to enjoy the anointing amen but as a word is being preached he begins to believe the word of faith and he begins to disbelieve the spirit and he begins to say but I am a Son of God and he stands up on his feet and that devil begins to back up because that devil realizes that he's losing his hole amen listen amen here's brother Benjamin over here and that Spirit leaves brother Christopher and it goes over to brother Benjamin and it says you're too young amen you're too young amen you're you're you're a boy amen you got a HT arm amen you can't praise God Amen but brother Benjamin looks over at brother Christopher and he says wait a second he said he's the same yesterday today and forever and my God is no respect of a person if he can do it for my brother he can do it for me and that Spirit begins to back off listen amen that's two breakthroughs amen but there's about a hundred people here this morning and that spirit is going from one to the other but you know what I say I say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you by the authority of the Holy Ghost take your hands off of God's Property House of Hell give way to the manifestation of the name of Jesus Christ we're not cowards we're not susceptible we are believers we are not subject to n God we are not subject to Nicol and Devils we are the sons and daughters of God back up devil back up [Applause] devil I said back up devil there's a breakthrough on the church there's a releasing on the church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now you got two breakthroughs and it turns into three and it turns into four and it turns into five and it turns into six and before long it turns into a hundred and before long devils are scattered you say brother Andrew there's a lot of devils in here this morning amen well let me say what a prophet said he said I believe with all my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already [Applause] broken every demon power that's in this building this morning is already broken feel that brother it's already broken brother Barry I'm not a crazy man it's like a bol of lightning just went through my body those demons are already broken Calgary Living Word I come by to tell you amen don't you let some spirit amen hang over this church hang over this pastor hang over these young people I say the best days for this church are not behind you they're just ahead of you but you got to break through you got to break beyond the condemnation you got to go beyond the past it's all ready broken see that's what's the matter the devil has broke away from you he has to because Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God I love what the proud of God says he says the word of God made made manifest now watch this Faith takes God's word for what it says and start rejoicing brother said you're wanting a Revival then start watering the word the promise he said that makes me feel religious myself you want to come out of that wheelchair then start watering the word if you want to come from that cancer amen then start watering the word you say preacher what is the watering of the word it is the praising of God means the word will begin to grow when you begin to praise well somebody kick back no praising God devil out of the building when you begin to praise the word begins to grow listen I'm not out of the Bible I'm in Psalms 150 praise him on the string instruments praise him on the high sounding symbols praise him on the timber Praise Him in a dance praise him on the guitar but listen he didn't leave it on the platform he brought the praise into the body he said let every thing that has breath praise ye the Lord you know what I say I say it's time to praise God until Devils back up I say it's time to praise God until the Holy Ghost comes among the church and brings to pass the promise of the word I say praise him in the morning praise him in the noon day praise him in the evening praise him on the mountain Praise Him in the valley praise him when you're well praise him when you're sick praise him when you're rich praise him when you're broke let everything that hath breath praise ye the [Applause] Lord hallelujah praise him I said praise him I said praise him praise him praise him break that devil this morning praise God praise him for the Revival praise him for the Revelation praise him for the anointing praise him for the promise praise him for the healing praise him this morning somebody say well well I ain't worthy to praise we ain't praising you oh that's cor it don't matter if you're worthy or not we ain't praising you but he's worthy you areth somebody say how do you water the word well according to a prophet the water in the word is the punctuating the word with an amen amen yes sir when it said repent and be baptized amen when it says these other things amen that's it amen to everything now can I can I just drop something to you people get a little bother when people in the message go to praising like that but can I just tell you something the praise of the Bride is different right she does not wait until it's manifested to praise right but the minute she receives the promise she begins to praise on the promise for the coming manifestation see in other words they praise before the manifestation then when the manifestation comes their praise goes to a higher level than you thank you Lord uh I said like this there was a woman one time in a meeting and her husband had been out of church for years and the preacher was preaching on prodical coming home and man she got fired up while he was preaching Brother Don she just stepped she said he's coming in he's coming in praise God he's coming in come back the next night and the preacher preached the second part on it she stood up and said I went home last night and he was drinking alcohol but he's coming in hallelujah hallelujah she got up and started walking around a little bit you know maybe like like our sister Susan here amen might walk around a bit he's coming in amen then the next night she come back and the preacher got to preaching on the prodal he brought from when he was out in the Pig spin he brought him to when he come to himself and the next night he preached on him coming home she got up and got just shouting and dancing and rejoicing he said oh my there she goes she said don't mind me he's coming in he's coming in so she dancing down the aisle and somebody stopped her and they said sis what are you shouting about she said I'm shouting because he's coming in I'm praising because he's coming in the next night amen they come back to the meeting and the preacher moved from him coming home amen as we spoke last night to putting clothes on him Amen in a in a good meal amen about that time the doors bust wide open and here come walking that man he come walking down the aisle and he gave his heart to God the woman standing over there had her hands up in the air she was just weeping she was just praising God and somebody went to her and said sis you've been shouting for three nights that he's coming in and he's come in and now you ain't doing nothing but stand there and praise and she said you just give me a break I've been praising in advance I thought that's pretty good amen you know what I say I say we ought to praise God in advance we ought to praise him before one grain of sand moves we ought to praise him before one thing changes listen friends somebody's going to preach it listen and somebody's going to believe it amen somebody say well amen I don't agree with all this dance in the church well let me just tell you what a prophet said he said what is the evidence of your healing when you believe it no matter what takes place you say I don't feel better don't have nothing to do with it you got the purchase power you believe it so just start dancing a little jig and saying praise God I'm going to be well because I've got the purchasing power of the loaf of bread listen before you get too critical before you get too critical let me bring you a testimony amen from the preaching of that quote there was a man sitting in brother Donnie Reagan's Church a few years ago amen eat up with leukemia and brother Donnie stood there and read that quote and in the front of 600 people that man stood up on the front row and just started doing a little jig the man is Leukemia 3 today this ain't emotion this is the preaching of the word of faith it's a breakthrough on the church it's a reality it's a prophecy coming into Power God by his spirit amen sends his word and then he energizes his word amen by his Spirit can I say this to you this is the word of the Lord UND deserv saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord somebody say the word the word is energized ised by the Spirit by the spirit not my [Music] feelings the spirit ain't sent to energize your feelings that's right they'll lie to you right brother said not by wisdom not by knowledge not by denomination but by my spirit will I energize my word he said see the disciples had it swed into them then the Spirit come to energize the word so the disciples already had the word so when the spirit came it came to the word see it's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it grow in other words you don't maybe understand it but right here this morning in this building there is an unseen energy Among Us Jesus said I am the vine amen and ye are the branches brother said parkerburg 56 he said now if he will let me know what you his daughter let I his his child his son know what his daughter wants then I being a man and you a woman there has to be something between us here amen it has to be God using us as branches see he's being theine now watch this he's energizing your heart to believe and he's energizing mine to yield another place he says as we yield our Soul and Spirit to you as vessels as I yield mine to you for a mouthpiece I yield my eyes for the vision I yield my mind for your word then you yield your hearts and your spirits to receive listen that's why there's got to be a surrendered atmosphere that's why the preacher has to be surrendered amen but you got to be surrendered [Music] am come on Church let's just preach here a second amen how would listen brother Barry come up here to the pull pit and he got up here Wednesday night and he said well hey Church how y'all doing you know and he sat there with his arms folded a little bit and he said amen y'all love the Lord amen well let's turn over here in our Bibles and see if we can find something to say and he gets up there and he flips through his Bible and he goes to John 3:16 Says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen how many believes in Jesus well y'all feeling good doing good amen sit turn and looks at you for a second reads you a quote amen I tell you what it don't it won't be too many services and you'll have a little committee formed which is of the devil you'll have a little committee formed and you'll be going around saying well brother Barry he ain't prepared he ain't studying he gets up there ill prepared well let me just tell you this amen how does it feel to brother Barry when he gets up here prepared and you sit there unprepared you want him surrendered amen but you want to sit there with your ideas and your objections and your motives and what you don't like and what you feel you know what I say I say that's where a wall comes amen between a church and a pastor amen is when a Pastor so surrenders himself to God that he becomes basically a dis rag in the hands of God and he just becomes so open I'm getting open here I'm sorry but he becomes so open to receive from the mind of God and he comes to the pull pit and he's taking time away from his wife he's taking time away from his kids and he stands here and he's pouring his heart out and you sit there like a bump on a pickle and you got your mind on your job you got your mind on your 401k you got your mind on what you don't like in the church amen it'll wear that man down but you know what I say I say if we require the pulpit to be prepared and we require the spirit of the preacher to be yielded to receive the word of God I say we ought to prepare ourselves to receive the word that he has yielded himself to receive I ain't afraid of that devil I ain't afraid of that devil I've seen it before listen friends amen it's time to get back to having [Applause] Church amen well we might as well just preach it's in the room Spirits amen they want to build walls up and then some guy gets a little Revelation and he thinks he knows more than the pastor right well glory to God I don't know that devil scattered it's Spirits now if we have to be yielded to preach you got to be yielded to receive you know what I say I say start preparing yourself to come to church that's good there ought to be an Amen on that there ought to be an Amen on that there ought to be an amen from every believer on that amen it may be ouch but say Amen behind the ouch because it's steal the word of [Applause] [Music] God yield it now brother B said this I think that devil got out here brother said yield himself to preach the gospel now watch this then we yield our hearts a amen amen let me just back up and say this amen I think the house of God ought to have preeminence in everything amen yes remember one time I was preaching over in Virginia in a meeting one time and brother I just preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and preaching and I was just giving it all I had I just just a young preacher just started out on the field and I remember I looked over am man man and there was a there was a man sitting over there and he had his checkbook out and his calculator and he had his pen and a piece of scrap paper and the whole time we was having church he was balancing his checkbook I mean it wasn't a casual balance it was a a calculator and scratch paper and so we come out of church and he said well he said I'll just say this he said I've heard all that before and I said well I'll just say this amen I think it's a little disrespectful he said what do you mean so then he wants to start telling me all the problems with the pastor you and I'm thinking buddy you picked the wrong guy Hallelujah he going start telling me how the pastor does this and the pastor does that and he don't like fish he don't like that and all and all of a sudden he just looks at me and he goes you know what I just I just guess I just I said I guess you just need a Revival I said cuz I guarantee you when you got saved you weren't balancing your checkbook you was back in the word of God but when things become common Spirits begin to come in but can I say this this morning amen it's time to break the spirit you give room for one devil you give him an inch he'll take two I'm sorry you all on what metric amen you give him an inch you give he'll take two you give him a foot he'll take two feet are you hearing me you give him a yard he'll take 10 I say somewhere somebody has got to stand up and say devil you've gone his far as you're going to go now I know what I'm talking about spiritual real are you hearing me and Spirits want to go from one generation to another generation in other words what was a spirit in one generation or a limitation will be passed down and become a limitation in another I remember one time like this amen I was preaching in a service and while I was preaching the spirit of the Lord just began to deal with me on temper and I began to preach on God delivering somebody from a temper and when I said that amen there was a man come out the back and he come down the altar carrying his baby and he was weeping his eyes out and I just went over and prayed for him I didn't know what he was wanting from God Amen but as I was praying for him when I got up we left we come back a few months later to that church and there was a testimony on the bulletin board how that God delivered that man in that service from a temper now you know what motivated the Deliverance was he said while the minister was preaching he said Spirits go from one generation to another he said the other day I saw in my daughter amen my temper being reflected in her and he said I thought God Amen I don't want her to carry this he said so we came down together God we came down together and he said the Holy Ghost broke the thing listen friends how many believes the Holy Ghost amen still has the ability Amen to break generational curses he has the ability Amen to break besetting sins listen things that controlled your fathers and forefathers amen do not have a right to control you because you are underneath a blood sacrifice atement there is a blood and that blood is a powerful blood and that blood has the ability to say Satan you've gone as far as you're going to go amen can I take you to the Bible on it John 19:30 when Jesus therefore received the vinegar he said these words it is finished it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost look at this word finished it means to bring to a close it means to perform or to execute it means to per are y'all ready for this it means to perform the last act which completes a process well glory to God Amen he was in the process of redeeming mankind but the last Act was when he hung between the heavens and the Earth and he said these three words he said it is finished that word finish means to pay it means Christ satisfied God's justice by Dying For All the sins of the Saints you need a Deliverance this morning how many says I need a Deliverance how many says I need a healing how many says I need something from God can I say this to you you don't have to go to Calvary to get it you don't have to go hang on the cross and die amen listen amen we don't have to go to Jerusalem Amen to go to the literal Place amen but what was done there has come here by the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ now can I just say something that's amazing is when Jesus died he said it is finished right do you notice what he didn't say he did not say cancer is finished because if he only said cancer is finished that means that's the only thing finished but he said it he said it which gives you the license to identify what it is is and when you identify what it is then you have a right to say it's finished can I say this morning amen some of y'all need to put depression there and say it's finished you need to put condemnation come on I'm preaching to you you need to put condemnation there and say it's finished you need to put division there and say it's finished you need to put your past there and say it's finished the word has finished the devil this morning you ain't got to go to Calvary literally you ain't got to pay $5,000 and go to the tomb where Jesus died amen was buried to receive the benefit of his resurrection quickening power is in this building this morning hey if the same spirit that raised our Lord from the dead if it dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies I say quickening power is in this building this morning what you do doing it's influencing your heart to believe the word of faith let me say thisall it's finished it's finished Hallelujah the devil is finished sin is finished generational curses finished habits finished besetting sins finished negative attitudes finished rebellious Spirits finished tempers finished unforgiveness finished bitterness finished hateful Spirits finished grudges finished come on church it's finished this morning you say preacher I don't feel like it's finished it ain't got nothing to do with the way you feel it ain't to how you feel it's up to what the word says and if the word says it's finished then the only thing you got to do is accept the Revelation it is finished hallelujah it's finished devil you've tormented me your last day it's over it's finished I refuse to serve that devil I refuse to serve that oppression it is finished I accept the finished work of the Cross of Calvary in the power of the reality of a resurrection hallelujah it's finished it's finished it's up to your faith to accept the finished work you say preacher when's it finished the minute you accepted it was finished 2,000 years ago Hallelujah the minute you accept the Revelation amen see right now the devil's got some of you thinking you got to keep paying for things it's finished and then where's our where's our brother it was at breakfast yesterday morning got that blessing with the car and then I ain't going to TI tell your testimony but pretty powerful amen they gave him the bill and it was paid for is that okay to share they give you the bill he's paid for I love what he said he said I didn't ask no questions he said I just walked on out because it was finished come on Church the old motor's gone there's a new motor coming in the car it's paid for can I say this the old man is dead the old man is dead sin nature is dead that cabur amen is got to come subject to the Holy Ghost you know what I say Amen quit trying to figure out how you're going to pay for it and just say thank you Lord when you said it is finished you paid sins dead I can walk out of here free I can walk out of here whole I can walk out of here with joy unspeakable it is finished how many believes that Jesus Christ completed the Plan of Salvation and healing at Calvary how many believes that can I see your hand you believe that Jesus Christ completed the plan then a prophet said now listen the only thing he can do is shock you or bring you to an understanding that he's still God and he keeps his promise amen amen so in doing so he anoints preachers that's These Fine men standing around here and many back there he anoint oints them to preach am amen anointed preachers well Jesus said you had a little while in the world shipping no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also can I identify three people there can I identify the world as the unbeliever can I identify ye as the believer can I identify I as Christ the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live brother said I Christ in his church energizing bringing the same things he did when he was here on the earth he said the Christ that sends the man goes with him and is in him then Jesus Christ is in his church his branches energizing them bringing forth the same fruit that he brought when he was here on Earth now can I just say this it's a powerful statement he said then when he comes to the church in the last days he comes come in the fullness of the light of the Sun so when light comes what does light do light exposes the darkness now watch here the fullness of Christ in the bride right is making her undefeatable so when he comes in the fullness of his light or in the fullness of himself he will come in light and what he comes into will become undefeatable brother said when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there is nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you're absolutely undefeatable well somebody put your joy shoes on in the house of God Amen nud somebody next to you and say you're undefeatable well I had a bad day you're undefeatable young man amen well I don't feel like it brother Barry you're undefeatable sister Lisa it don't matter what the devil flows against you it don't matter the Mind battles and the stresses and the pressures there is a revelation on the inside of your soul that's making you undefeatable listen then what happens when the word comes forth the spirit of God energizes the Revelation that's in your soul you all know you've come to church on Wednesday nights and you said this is my last service I can't go another step this is as far as I can go and you better barely make it in the house of God and you barely make it to your seat and you barely sit down and the whole song service the preacher or the song leaders trying to get the world off your shoulders and you're just sitting there like this and you're saying well I can't go no further am I preaching anybody well I've gone as far as I can go and it's just too hard and then here comes that man of God who's fought all hell to get to the pull pit and he gets up there and he begins to say greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he begins to say if God be for you then who can be against you he begins to say though a thousand fall at one side and 10,000 fall at my other side they will not come nigh thee and while you're sitting there underneath that mind battle the spirit of God begins to energize the word seed and it causes a reaction and you stand up and you say yes sir I'm going to make it I've already made it I'm going to overcome he's already overcome the re Revelation in your soul will make you undefeatable there is no devil there is no Spirit there is no Goliath big enough bad enough to defeat this bride when the spirit comes to the [Applause] word when the spirit when it comes to the word it'll energize the [Applause] word you're absolutely [Music] undefeatable amen thank amen not you but the god that's in [Music] [Applause] you I just want to let that one hover for a minute not you that's right brother mvin the god that's in you not Mary the word that was born in her now can I have just a few more minutes according to Galatians 4 Mary was persecuted right right do you know when the persecution come he said when Christ Jesus was being formed in her that's right he says but she was undefeatable Hallelujah amen well can I just go ahead and say it and it's the same thing in you yes when Christ the hope of glory formed in you Christ is being formed in you when you are dying and Christ has coming to life then watch the persecution set in watch trouble start on every hand watch the devil will go on a rampage certainly when Christ is being formed in you what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this in this age you will either have a breakthrough or you will have a break down the spirits are real amen yes the pressure are great can I just tell you something just just to just to leave you with a few thoughts here you know what it breakdown is a breakdown is a mechanical failure a failure of a relationship or a system now that's a breakthrough or a breakdown but a breakthrough I love this a breakthrough is a sudden dramatic and important Discovery or development are you ready for this it is an instant it is an instance of achieving success in a particular sphere so when you have a breakthrough you break into another sphere what is a sphere it is a domain it is a realm it is a kingdom so the Prophet by discernment broke through another sphere he said now listen the human part is gone and the supernatural comes in and works through the human flesh the supernatural working through see brother says can I read you a few quotes here is that okay okay he says see you got to break into a sphere that people know nothing about he said may it sway over the building till people will just lose sight of their diseases and sway on out in those spheres where they can see Jesus and take his word he said now come near to me father and anoint thy servant and pack me God have mercy pack me from this sense bound existence into the Spheres where you live so obviously Jesus amen does not live underneath this sense bound existence but there is a sphere that is not bound by the Sick senses that a Believer can go to and he said now Thou Art here Lord oh God amen amen can I can I just preach to you for a second hallelujah thank you Jesus he says Thou Art here Lord and the devil knows his Time Has Come Thou Art here Lord and the devil knows this time has come to this woman oh who are you this morning you are a little faith woman you are an

today I know we've got things to do and places to go and you know if you're in a hurry and you need to go we certainly don't want to hold you we want you to have the Liberty to just feel free but you know something special took place here today and I want to say something special is taking place today you know I just can't help but think brother Andrew was was was preaching and and the Lord was speaking to us through him it just made me think about a man one time he came in the in the prayer line and in the prayer line he got prayed for and and his symptoms never changed when he left the prayer line and and he came back in the prayer line and he saw the prophet again and and he said I thought you said I was healed and the prophet said I thought you believed I thought you said you believed and what happened was that man caught a revelation in that moment and when he caught that revelation it didn't matter what anybody thought it didn't matter what anybody said to the point where the deacons were trying to kick him out of some of the churches because he had a hat on top of a Cane running up and down the aisles saying I can see I can see I can see and everybody said you're blind until one day but what did he do he actually worshiped all the way along to the place where the Barbers were mocking that man they were mocking him saying oh you can see Canya he was a blind shoe cobbler I guess I can relate to it but he could he couldn't see anything naturally speaking but he could see the Promise and that's what counted and because of that Revelation in his heart he was able to worship and it didn't matter what anybody thought and you know what brothers and sisters if we have a need in our hearts in our lives it doesn't matter what anybody thinks you know what if we come to the place where our back is up against the wall and we get a dose of cancer or we're on our deathbed or our children need salvation whatever it is who cares what anybody thinks worship accept the promise of God it's here for you now don't wait till tomorrow that's right you might not see tomorrow true oh my thank you brother Daniel God bless you brother I just feel like having

Jesus we're so thankful for your goodness and your tender Mercy to us once again amen Lord Jesus for you to come by here and tell us that there ain't no devil that's got any power over your bride and father to know that Lord when you were here on Earth Earth in the flesh and and you you taught you you expounded all of the scriptures and then you went to the cross and as we heard you say this morning after you got the vinegar you said it's finished and Lord I believe you spoke to me in that moment a and you said to me you gave up the ghost and we know you didn't give up the ghost to go to Rome you didn't give up the ghost to go to heaven you gave up the ghost for your bride body and father there's a group of people here in Calgary today that we accept the provision that you have made

person on the other side of the log and we saw some logs today Father oh Lord Jesus though there might have been some people snoring father there was others that were pulling and father we thank you

a touch from you and his physical body and Lord we know that that healing power that's in this building today Father you could touch that boy in the name of Jesus Christ and father he could go and see a doctor and the doctor would say what happened did he already have a surgery because there's no need for a surgery we know that that's the God you are and father we just rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that's come upon that boy and we just ask that you would heal him now in the name of Jesus Christ and father we'll go forwards worshiping you we'll go forwards praising you towards the manifestation of that word we love you and we thank you we just commit each life into your hands father as we go our separate ways father we just miss all those who are away we know it's about half
