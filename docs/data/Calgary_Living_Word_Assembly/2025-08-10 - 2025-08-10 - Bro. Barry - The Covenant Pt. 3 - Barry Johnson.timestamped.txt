[38:59] hearts for prayer. Our dear heavenly
[39:01] father, Lord, this morning
[39:06] this is what you have done. Lord, your
[39:09] grace has brought us all together in
[39:12] your house.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Father, we've come this morning
[39:17] bringing our praises and our worship to
[39:19] you. We didn't deserve to come here this
[39:22] morning by your grace. Call us when we
[39:24] didn't know what we were doing. And here
[39:26] we are this morning once again with our
[39:28] brothers and our sisters. Lord, you
[39:31] protected us when we went to work, when
[39:33] we went to school, our businesses, Lord.
[39:36] And this morning, we want to defy
[39:38] gravity and lift up our voice and our
[39:41] and our hands and worship you this
[39:43] morning, Lord. It is always good to see
[39:47] brothers and sisters some going through
[39:50] very difficult time but when the doors
[39:52] are open Lord you give them strength.
[39:56] You give us strength to get up and come
[39:58] here. Sometimes
[40:02] it's not difficult for someone.
[40:04] But it is my prayer this morning that we
[40:07] don't come here this morning to look
[40:09] after one another.
[40:11] But we come here because of your
[40:13] strength. And you have also promised us
[40:15] to be among us when we meet. May you
[40:18] move from person to person this morning.
[40:20] Lord, may you look through the people
[40:22] this morning. Lord, every need that is
[40:26] not made known, Lord, may you touch that
[40:28] need, Lord. And I believe, Lord, we will
[40:31] come back and give you thanks.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we pray for each
[40:35] and everyone that is tuning in.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; May you touch their hearts, Lord. May
[40:42] you meet their needs, Lord Jesus. As our
[40:45] prophet told us, if we are traveling and
[40:48] we see a red light, what do we do? We
[40:50] wait. If we have brought something
[40:53] before you and it's not there yet, we
[40:55] wait. Father, this morning, help us to
[40:58] have the faith to wait that you would do
[41:00] it.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we want to invite
[41:03] you to come and minister your word to
[41:06] us. Your servant has done what he can
[41:08] do, but when he's going to come here, it
[41:10] takes you to move him aside and speak to
[41:13] the individual needs that we have here
[41:15] this morning. Once again, we are
[41:18] bringing our tithes and offering to you.
[41:20] We ask you to receive it for Jesus name
[41:23] that we pray. Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[41:32] Heavenly Father,
[41:35] I appreciate
[41:38] you.
[41:42] Oh, heavenly father,
[41:45] I appreciate
[41:48] you.
[41:49] [Music]
[41:53] I love you.
[41:56] I adore you.
[41:59] I bow down
[42:01] before you,
[42:03] heavenly father.
[42:06] I appreciate
[42:09] you.
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] Sorry, there was somebody that mentioned
[42:15] there might be a special this morning.
[42:16] Brother Owen, your family, might you
[42:19] have a special this morning? If you if
[42:22] you do, would you? Okay. All right. All
[42:26] right. Let's sing it once more as they
[42:27] come and I'll have you take your seats.
[42:29] Heavenly Father,
[42:32] I appreciate
[42:35] you.
[42:42] I
[42:47] [Music]
[42:51] love you. I adore you.
[42:56] I bow down
[42:58] before you
[43:01] father.
[43:07] [Music]
[43:20] Praise the Lord.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; We bring you greetings from the church
[43:24] in Green Brother. He says to speak the
[43:26] church. So your love pray this song will
[43:30] be a blessing. May you help me sing it
[43:32] if you know it. Let's just worship God.
[43:34] Praise God.
[43:38] Consider
[43:40] [Music]
[43:44] the lily.
[43:46] They don't toil or spin.
[43:52] But there's
[43:54] another king
[43:57] with more splender
[43:59] than him.
[44:02] and cedar
[44:05] the sparrow.
[44:08] They don't plant or soul,
[44:12] but they're fed
[44:15] by the master
[44:18] who watches
[44:20] them grow.

[44:26] have an heavenly
[44:29] father
[44:31] above
[44:34] with us
[44:36] full of mercy
[44:38] and a heart that's full of love.
[44:44] And he
[44:46] really cares when your head is bowed
[44:52] low.
[44:54] Consider

[45:01] will.

[45:09] introduce you to this friend of mine
[45:17] who asks

[45:24] when to shine.
[45:27] and he kisses
[45:30] the flowers
[45:32] in it with you.
[45:37] But he's never
[45:40] ever too busy
[45:43] to care about
[45:45] you.
[45:48] We
[45:50] have an ever
[45:53] father
[45:55] above
[45:58] without
[46:00] full of mercy
[46:02] and a heart that's full of love.
[46:08] And he
[46:10] really cares when our heads are bowed.
[46:16] Lord,
[46:18] consider
[46:20] the living
[46:23] and then you will know.

[50:25] The Lord's pleased this morning, I
[50:27] believe, with the with the glory and
[50:29] honor and the the adoration that we're
[50:32] giving him. He's our husband. He loves
[50:34] to be served. He loves to be worshiped.
[50:36] Let's just give him praise this morning
[50:38] as we lift our hands, maybe our hearts
[50:42] just in prayer. Lord, would you fill my
[50:44] cup over to overflowing? Lord, I want to
[50:46] I want a blessing that I can contain.
[50:49] Let's sing it this morning. Fill my cup
[50:51] as our pastor comes. Well, fill my cup,
[50:56] Lord.
[50:59] I lift it up,
[51:03] Lord.
[51:06] Come and quench
[51:11] this thirsting
[51:13] of my soul.
[51:19] Oh bread of heaven
[51:24] for peace till I want
[51:29] no more.
[51:32] Fill my cup or fill it up and make me
[51:40] whole.
[51:43] Oh, feed me till I want no more
[51:51] [Music]
[51:59] make me whole.
[52:05] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[52:06] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[52:08] Another beautiful Sunday, another
[52:11] opportunity to gather together with our
[52:13] brothers and sisters of like precious
[52:16] faith.
[52:17] Just like to welcome all of our
[52:19] visitors. There's many. God richly bless
[52:22] you. I trust you feel right at home and
[52:24] that the Lord blesses you today.
[52:28] We just like to welcome brother
[52:30] Pastor Chris Olo
[52:34] Coro. I hope I pronounced that
[52:37] correctly. I apologize if I didn't. He's
[52:39] a pastor of a message church in
[52:43] in Nigeria. God richly bless you. I
[52:47] apologize. Uh where are you at, brother?
[52:51] Over here. God bless you, brother.
[52:53] Welcome.
[53:00] As I understand, this is the pastor of
[53:02] Brother Saints former church.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I certainly want to welcome
[53:07] you and each and everyone today as we
[53:10] gather around the throne to feast on the
[53:13] word of the Lord.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Did you come hungry today?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; We know that he's more than able to feed
[53:21] us. Thank you so much for the special
[53:24] today. We uh just have a couple of
[53:28] requests that we would like to bring
[53:29] before the throne. Brother Jerry
[53:30] Carpenter has a bad cold. There's a
[53:32] request for brother Andy Vanderplass. We
[53:36] would like to continue to remember
[53:38] brother Jeff's cousin who in is in need
[53:41] of a touch. And we also would like to
[53:44] just continue to uphold the the Huckluck
[53:47] family at this time. And if you have a
[53:50] need, by all means, just make it known
[53:52] unto him by way of an uplift hand.
[54:00] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[54:02] you for this opportunity to
[54:05] &gt;&gt; gather together one more time the way
[54:06] that you've ordained for us. Lord Jesus,
[54:10] you gave us the direction and we follow
[54:12] it, Lord.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that we can do
[54:16] that. And Lord, I know that our desire
[54:17] is to be able to follow your directions
[54:19] even closer, Lord Jesus.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Many times it feels like we fall short,
[54:26] probably because we do, Lord, and we
[54:27] just ask that you would forgive us for
[54:29] it.
[54:30] And Lord Jesus, this morning we just
[54:32] want to remember the needs that we we
[54:35] spoke about. Lord, each and every uplift
[54:37] hand, Lord, is a need. Maybe multiple
[54:40] needs
[54:41] &gt;&gt; made known unto you today. We just ask
[54:43] that you would meet them sovereignly
[54:44] according to your word, which is your
[54:46] will.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you praise,
[54:49] Lord. We're so thankful for the many
[54:51] praise reports that we get because they
[54:54] equal answered prayer. And we're so
[54:57] thankful that you're not a god of the
[54:59] past and you're not somewhere out in the
[55:01] future. You are the great I am present
[55:03] tense in every one of our lives, Lord.
[55:07] Father, we just want to remember, Lord,
[55:10] the Huckluck family, Lord, the passing
[55:12] of brother Johnny. We know that he's
[55:15] come up to your house today and we're so
[55:17] thankful for the testimony in his life.
[55:19] Lord,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; just pray that you would comfort those
[55:23] in need, Lord. that you would bind up
[55:25] the brokenhearted.
[55:27] It's not easy on this side, Lord. And we
[55:30] know that the the holes of those loved
[55:32] ones that pass on can never be filled.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful, Lord Jesus, for the
[55:37] time that we have with one another.
[55:40] So, we pray that you would just bless
[55:41] the memories and Lord, give us the the
[55:44] promise. Lord, help us to look to the
[55:46] promise where we know that we'll meet
[55:48] with them again.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to remember
[55:51] Brother Jeff's cousin. just want to hold
[55:53] him before your throne, Lord. He needs a
[55:55] touch from you. And Father, more than
[55:57] anything, we pray that he could just
[55:59] come to know you in the power of your
[56:00] resurrection for himself, Lord.
[56:04] Father, we just want to remember brother
[56:05] Andy Vanderlass. Lord, he needs a touch.
[56:07] And brother Jerry Carpenter, Lord, he
[56:10] needs a touch. Father, we're so thankful
[56:12] that we can bring our needs
[56:15] &gt;&gt; to the altar. Lord Jesus, we just ask
[56:18] now as we go forwards that you would
[56:19] just lead the way, that you would speak
[56:22] to us gently one more time. Father, just
[56:25] ask all these things now. In Jesus
[56:27] Christ's name we pray.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just ask you to take your
[56:32] seats and we're going to we're going to
[56:36] sing that song. Bring them in as we have
[56:39] a baby dedication today.
[56:42] Sister Michelle and brother Emanuel.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and Sister Karen have a new
[56:48] member in their family
[56:50] &gt;&gt; and we're certainly thankful for that.
[56:52] It's the Lobe family that moved here
[56:55] from Cameroon early in the year and
[56:58] brother Peter and sister Janet have
[57:00] diligently looked after them. God bless
[57:02] you the Bochi Manus. We certainly
[57:05] appreciate your efforts there. We know
[57:07] the Lord doesn't uh doesn't let those
[57:10] things go lightly when we help one
[57:11] another. Um so we would just like to
[57:14] sing that song. bring them in if you
[57:16] don't mind as we invite them to come
[57:18] forward with a new member of their
[57:20] family. Jemule
[57:23] and uh her name means beauty or day of
[57:26] God.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Jeule Azerel
[57:30] means God has helped
[57:33] lobe. God richly bless you. If you want
[57:36] to just come forward, brother, we will
[57:38] dedicate the baby. Bring them in.
[57:43] Bring them in.
[57:47] Bring them in from the field of sin.
[57:55] Bring them in.
[57:59] Bring them in.
[58:02] Bring the big ones to Jesus.
[58:08] [Music]
[58:11] Amen. Amen.
[58:13] Amen.
[58:16] Amen.
[58:18] [Music]
[58:25] Look at that.
[58:27] My
[58:31] I'm starting to see now
[58:34] what it's like how it's hard to believe
[58:37] that they can be this small.
[58:40] Can you see her?
[58:44] She's absolutely adorable
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and fast asleep. My
[58:52] Let's just pray.
[58:55] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[58:58] it's truly an honor and a privilege to
[59:00] stand before you this morning with the
[59:03] Lobe family.
[59:05] Lord, Sister Michelle and Brother
[59:09] Emanuel and Sister Karen. Father, as we
[59:13] see the baby, Lord, we prayed for a safe
[59:16] delivery of the baby, Lord. And we're so
[59:20] thankful that you never disappoint us,
[59:22] Lord, that you always answer prayer. And
[59:25] Father, we're so thankful for this life
[59:27] that you've delivered to the Lobe
[59:29] family. Lord, you brought them from a
[59:31] foreign land to Calgary. And Lord Jesus,
[59:34] by your leadership, now they've had a
[59:36] baby here. And Father, you answered the
[59:39] prayer and gave Brother Emanuel a job
[59:42] and a baby all at the same time. We know
[59:45] that you're more than able to meet each
[59:47] and every need, Father. And Lord Jesus,
[59:49] this morning we just gather together and
[59:52] we dedicate this little life, Lord, of
[59:55] Sister Chimule, Lord Jesus, that you
[59:57] would take her and use her for your
[59:59] glory. Father, we pray that you would
[1:00:01] keep sickness from her life, Lord Jesus.
[1:00:04] We also ask, Father, that she would have
[1:00:06] not only the desire but the ability to
[1:00:09] dedicate her life, that the time of
[1:00:11] accountability would come swiftly in her
[1:00:14] life, Lord, as we live in a world of
[1:00:16] darkness, that her desire would be for
[1:00:18] you, Lord, and that she would be able to
[1:00:20] receive the true baptism of your Holy
[1:00:23] Spirit, your very life living out
[1:00:25] through her, Lord, that would lead her
[1:00:26] and guide her and protect her. Father,
[1:00:29] as parents, we can only do so much for
[1:00:32] our children. But we know your word says
[1:00:34] to train them up in the way they should
[1:00:36] go and it won't depart from them, Lord,
[1:00:40] and they won't depart from it. And
[1:00:42] Father, we know that it is you.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; So, Father, this morning we stand
[1:00:46] together as a as a body of believers
[1:00:48] here in Calgary. And we just dedicate
[1:00:51] this little girl unto you, Lord. Sister
[1:00:54] Jimule, we pray that you would just
[1:00:56] watch over her and keep her, Lord. Bless
[1:00:58] the Lobe family, Lord. Help Brother
[1:01:00] Emanuel as he navigates in Calgary,
[1:01:03] Lord. It's not easy coming to a foreign
[1:01:05] land. We pray that you would just be his
[1:01:07] lead and his guide. Father, watch over
[1:01:10] Sister Michelle, Lord, as she has the
[1:01:12] children now at home. We pray that you
[1:01:14] would just keep your hand upon them all
[1:01:17] the days of their life. We just ask all
[1:01:19] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[1:01:21] we pray.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] musicians get to see her.
[1:01:30] She's absolutely beautiful. God richly
[1:01:33] bless you.
[1:01:37] Amen.
[1:01:39] Bring them in.
[1:01:43] Bring them in.
[1:01:46] Bring
[1:01:48] them in from the fields of sin.
[1:01:54] Bring them in.
[1:01:58] Bring them in.
[1:02:02] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[1:02:08] Amen. If you don't mind, maybe just
[1:02:10] stand with me as we turn to the word.
[1:02:13] Thank you, musicians.
[1:02:15] If you have your Bibles, we'll just turn
[1:02:17] to Genesis. Genesis chapter 15.
[1:02:23] Genesis chapter 15.
[1:02:30] I want to keep talking today about the
[1:02:32] covenant.
[1:02:35] Genesis chapter 15. We'll just read from
[1:02:37] verse 17.
[1:02:44] And it came to pass that when the sun
[1:02:46] went down and it was dark, behold, a
[1:02:49] smoking furnace and a burning lamp that
[1:02:51] passed between those pieces.
[1:02:55] In the same day the Lord made a covenant
[1:02:57] with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I
[1:03:02] given this land from the river
[1:03:06] from the river of Egypt unto the great
[1:03:08] river, the river Euphrates.
[1:03:11] the Kennites, the Kennesites, and the
[1:03:15] Kammonites, and the Hittites, and the
[1:03:18] Perizzites,
[1:03:20] and the Raphims,
[1:03:22] and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
[1:03:25] and the Gegosites, and the Jebusites.
[1:03:29] Let's just bow one more time.
[1:03:32] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful for
[1:03:33] your word.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful that we can gather
[1:03:37] together around it freely, Lord.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask Lord now that you
[1:03:42] would bless it Father as we go forwards.
[1:03:44] We just ask that you would break it open
[1:03:46] to us freshmen
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; once again. This this loaf of bread,
[1:03:51] this bread of life, Father, break it
[1:03:53] open fresh to us, Lord. Nourish us with
[1:03:55] it, we ask. And we'll be careful to give
[1:03:58] you all the praise. We just ask all
[1:04:00] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:04:02] pray. Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. You
[1:04:06] may be seated.
[1:04:10] I see we have the uh
[1:04:13] brother Peter Hoffer here. Is Timothy
[1:04:16] here with us? He didn't come today.
[1:04:19] We're certainly thankful for the safe
[1:04:20] delivery of brother Timothy and uh yeah,
[1:04:24] the Lord sure is good. You know, we have
[1:04:27] uh just another little announcement that
[1:04:29] I wanted to make this morning. I got a
[1:04:31] text message very early this morning and
[1:04:34] if you don't mind just bringing up the
[1:04:35] slide in the email that I brought. We
[1:04:38] have a thank you from the uh from the
[1:04:42] newlyweds over in Nigeria.
[1:04:45] Certainly beautiful brother Victor and
[1:04:49] uh sister Rebecca
[1:04:51] Yumok.
[1:04:53] They just wanted to send a thank you to
[1:04:55] the congregation here. Says, "Dear
[1:04:57] Calgary Living Word of Family, we're so
[1:04:59] thankful for your love, prayers,
[1:05:01] generous support towards our wedding.
[1:05:04] Even though distance kept you away, we
[1:05:06] truly felt your presence and spirit.
[1:05:09] Your kindness has been such a blessing
[1:05:11] to us, and we pray God rewards you
[1:05:14] abundantly. We can't wait for the day we
[1:05:17] get to celebrate together. With love and
[1:05:20] gratitude, Rebecca and Victor, and what
[1:05:23] a beautiful wedding that looked like.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] I believe these must be the engagement
[1:05:37] photos. And it looks like they had a
[1:05:39] little bit of fun with it. And just a
[1:05:41] beautiful couple. It's amazing how the
[1:05:43] Lord does things. When uh we try and do
[1:05:46] things, we can make a mess, but when we
[1:05:48] wait upon the Lord, he will renew our
[1:05:51] strength.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; So, it's a wonderful thing to be able to
[1:05:55] just see them together. and they sent me
[1:05:58] a little video and it was just wonderful
[1:06:00] to to hear from brother Victor and Lord
[1:06:03] willing one day we'll get to meet them
[1:06:04] in person. So
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; just wanted to pass the regards along to
[1:06:08] the body here. So uh God richly bless
[1:06:11] them continue to pray for them. Continue
[1:06:13] to pray for all the newly weds.
[1:06:15] Certainly thankful for the what the Lord
[1:06:17] has done in brother Logan and sister
[1:06:18] Neve's life as well.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I believe uh was the same wedding day.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we have uh an anniversary in
[1:06:27] common. It's wonderful.
[1:06:30] I have uh just another thing that I
[1:06:32] wanted to mention here. It's a a prayer
[1:06:35] request to the congregation from uh
[1:06:38] Sister Mariel Larte. She has a request
[1:06:41] uh for a trip that she's taking to
[1:06:43] Colombia on August 15th. She'll be
[1:06:46] traveling with her grandson and two
[1:06:48] brothers. Says we're traveling to Bogota
[1:06:51] to attend a few fellowship meetings with
[1:06:54] the bride there.
[1:06:56] and uh
[1:06:58] many want to send their greetings to the
[1:07:00] bride in Colombia and I believe from
[1:07:02] Colombia. So she said, "God bless you
[1:07:04] all, Sister Mary Olerte." So we'll
[1:07:06] continue to remember Sister Mary and uh
[1:07:09] her request for the meetings there that
[1:07:12] the Lord will bless them abundantly.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Boy, we have a lot going on in the last
[1:07:19] uh few days, the remaining days of
[1:07:21] summer. We were just talking about it on
[1:07:23] the way to church this morning how it's
[1:07:25] going to be back to school in in just a
[1:07:28] few weeks and uh boy and then as I
[1:07:32] usually do I I had to say yes and we'll
[1:07:34] be shoveling snow as well very soon. And
[1:07:38] it's true unfortunately but you know the
[1:07:40] winters are beautiful here aren't they?
[1:07:44] But summers are nice too. We'll enjoy
[1:07:45] that while we have it.
[1:07:49] I'm certainly thankful to be back back
[1:07:52] in front of you once again and uh I just
[1:07:55] can't get away from this thought about
[1:07:57] the covenant and how God made an
[1:07:59] unconditional covenant with Abram even
[1:08:02] before he had a name change. And you
[1:08:04] know in our scripture this morning out
[1:08:06] of Genesis chapter 15,
[1:08:09] we have the story about how Abram, if
[1:08:12] you go back and read it, we won't for
[1:08:13] time sake. We've read it a few times in
[1:08:16] the past here and uh I just have other
[1:08:19] scriptures I want to get into today, but
[1:08:21] it's a story about how Abram was given
[1:08:24] the instruction to take the animals and
[1:08:26] divide them. And we had talked about
[1:08:28] this in the past about the brother
[1:08:30] Bradam called it the Chinese laundry.
[1:08:31] How there has to be a tear. We know
[1:08:34] covenant means a breaking, a tearing
[1:08:36] apart of the flesh is what it says. and
[1:08:40] uh in the meaning of of covenant. And we
[1:08:43] might be able to get into that a little
[1:08:44] bit later. And I just think it's a a
[1:08:47] neat thing here. Brother Brandon brings
[1:08:48] out like in verse 17, after Abram had
[1:08:51] laid out all the parts of the animals
[1:08:52] according to the instruction of the Lord
[1:08:55] for the sacrifice, the birds, the fowls
[1:08:58] came. And we had talked about this last
[1:09:00] time about how those birds and fowls
[1:09:02] will come and actually try and get into
[1:09:05] our sacrifice when we wait upon the Lord
[1:09:08] and when we present our sacrifice to the
[1:09:11] Lord. God bless you Odelene sisters. I
[1:09:14] didn't realize you were back. They were
[1:09:16] there for the wedding. It's certainly
[1:09:17] wonderful to see you again. But we can
[1:09:20] actually create a sacrifice unto the
[1:09:22] Lord and actually present it to the Lord
[1:09:25] which is a maybe a prayer and
[1:09:27] supplication and trust that the Lord
[1:09:29] will bring it to pass in our lives. And
[1:09:31] many times the Lord will make us wait
[1:09:34] for it because uh many times there's
[1:09:36] many different reasons for it. We know
[1:09:38] that in Daniel's day, Daniel cried unto
[1:09:41] the Lord and when when the angel of the
[1:09:43] Lord came to meet him, he said, "Hey,
[1:09:45] I've been fighting my way here for 21
[1:09:47] and one days to get here for your
[1:09:50] prayer." And uh from the moment you said
[1:09:52] it, God heard it and we've been
[1:09:55] dispatched to come and deal with it. But
[1:09:57] we were fighting against the prince of
[1:09:58] Persia. And you know, that was back in
[1:10:00] the day of of Daniel. And I I just can't
[1:10:03] help but think, you know, now that the
[1:10:04] lid of hell has been pulled off, how
[1:10:07] much more they have to fight to get
[1:10:09] through to answer our prayers. And we
[1:10:12] know God can just snap his finger and
[1:10:14] make it happen. But he allows things to
[1:10:17] happen so that something can happen in
[1:10:19] our lives. And what that is is a change
[1:10:21] of our character. And we know that's the
[1:10:23] gold that we are counseledled to buy in
[1:10:25] the Leodysian church age. Brother Brham
[1:10:28] brings it out in the church age book
[1:10:29] very clearly that even though God says
[1:10:32] in the Bible, I counsel thee to buy of
[1:10:35] me gold tried in the fire. But the
[1:10:39] Bradom says very clearly that that is
[1:10:41] the trials of fiery afflictions. And
[1:10:44] that gold is not gold as we would
[1:10:46] suppose.
[1:10:47] Gold, not gold bullion, not from Fort
[1:10:51] Knox, not from Switzerland, not gold as
[1:10:55] we would see it as an element on the
[1:10:57] periodic table, but character,
[1:11:00] Christlike character that only comes
[1:11:03] through fiery trials.
[1:11:07] But in this scripture here, we have
[1:11:09] Abram following the instruction of the
[1:11:11] Lord. And and it it came to pass that
[1:11:14] the day went long and it turned to
[1:11:16] night. And even though he had laid out
[1:11:19] his supplications and his sacrifice, his
[1:11:21] prayer unto the Lord according to the
[1:11:24] instructions that the Lord had given
[1:11:26] him, the fowls wanted to come and and
[1:11:29] get in it. They could smell that flesh
[1:11:31] and they wanted some. And the devil's no
[1:11:33] different today when we do it. But you
[1:11:36] know, there's got to be a time where
[1:11:37] that pillar of fire comes down just
[1:11:39] exactly like happened in this scripture
[1:11:41] prior where he comes and examines our
[1:11:44] sacrifice. And brother Brandham says it
[1:11:46] in a little bit of a different way. I
[1:11:48] think it's so good. He talks about the
[1:11:49] packing of a box car on a rail on on the
[1:11:53] rail cars, how box cars get packed. And
[1:11:56] you know when the box car gets packed,
[1:11:57] the inspector has to come and close the
[1:12:00] door and put the seal on it until its
[1:12:02] destination until the day of its
[1:12:05] destination. And that seal can't be
[1:12:07] broken. And you know what happens is it
[1:12:10] the inspector will come and he will see
[1:12:13] if that car is actually packed
[1:12:15] correctly. If it's not packed correctly
[1:12:17] during transit, it's going to get
[1:12:19] damaged. And I can't help but think
[1:12:22] about all of the people who haven't been
[1:12:24] given the solid foundation in and around
[1:12:26] the message of the hour. And through
[1:12:28] transit, through different ministries
[1:12:31] and experiences in their lives, somehow
[1:12:34] the car shakes and they lose their
[1:12:36] experience.
[1:12:38] They get damaged.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; But the inspector comes around and says,
[1:12:43] "No, you need to change this and no, you
[1:12:45] need to change that." And we talked
[1:12:46] about this in the past. I think it's so
[1:12:48] rich. The inspector does not unpack and
[1:12:51] repack cars.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He tells you to do it.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; We do it.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; It's up to us to unpack it all if we
[1:13:01] have to to get down to that last little
[1:13:03] thing in the bottom.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You couldn't take a carton of eggs and
[1:13:08] put them on the bottom. They'll get
[1:13:10] crushed.
[1:13:12] If we've got something fragile that's
[1:13:14] not dealt with properly in our lives at
[1:13:16] the foundation level, don't think you're
[1:13:19] going to build a spiritual kingdom on
[1:13:21] top of it.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; In this scripture here, he sets out his
[1:13:29] sacrifice and gives it to the Lord and
[1:13:31] the fowls come. And I just couldn't help
[1:13:33] but think about it last time we talked
[1:13:34] about this. How those fowls are just
[1:13:36] like the devils, just like those evil
[1:13:38] spirits that want to come around and
[1:13:40] upset us and say, "Oh man, God, he's
[1:13:43] heard your prayer. He must have heard
[1:13:44] your prayer the first time you said it.
[1:13:46] And here you sit, months, years,
[1:13:50] sometimes later on. Isn't he going to
[1:13:53] come and answer your prayer?" And
[1:13:54] sometimes he doesn't even answer our
[1:13:55] prayer the way we pray it.
[1:13:59] But brother Brandham says that's when
[1:14:00] you know if you love the Lord
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we need those in our lives
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; because you know when Abram this one
[1:14:09] here who was given the promise the
[1:14:11] promised seed we know that there was the
[1:14:13] singular seed which was Isaac the
[1:14:16] promised child and then there was the
[1:14:18] seed plural which is the royal seed of
[1:14:21] Abraham which category we fit into by
[1:14:23] the way. But Abram he was given a name
[1:14:26] change. He was given the promised son.
[1:14:28] His son grew up to about 14 years of
[1:14:31] age, wasn't it? And then God said, "Hey,
[1:14:33] Abraham, I've got another assignment for
[1:14:35] you, my servant." And no doubt, he woke
[1:14:38] up and said, "Yeah, Lord, right on. I
[1:14:40] got the promise. I'm ready to go." He
[1:14:42] said, "Bring your son to the top of the
[1:14:44] mountain that I'll give you instruction
[1:14:45] to, and I want you to offer him as a
[1:14:48] sacrifice."
[1:14:51] Can you imagine how many of us fathers
[1:14:53] would just be gloriously excited about
[1:14:55] that fiery trial?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my son to the top of
[1:14:59] the mountain and offer him as a
[1:15:01] sacrifice.
[1:15:03] But we know that Abram, remember we said
[1:15:05] it last time that he did not stumble at
[1:15:09] the promise of God through what?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. But he was strong giving glory
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; because he knew that God promised this.
[1:15:20] And if God actually allowed him to take
[1:15:23] his son, he would be obligated according
[1:15:25] to his word
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; that he would raise him up again.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having a relationship
[1:15:32] with God that way to know that he's
[1:15:34] obligated to his word that way? Not just
[1:15:36] for Abraham, but for us.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; That's for me. He's that obligated to me
[1:15:41] in my life.
[1:15:43] He's just waiting for us to catch that
[1:15:45] revelation, brothers and sisters.
[1:15:48] But verse 17 says, "When it came to pass
[1:15:50] that when the sun went down and it was
[1:15:52] dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a
[1:15:54] burning lamp that passed between those
[1:15:56] pieces, the inspector came down to
[1:15:59] investigate what was going on to see if
[1:16:01] everything was set in order according to
[1:16:04] his will." And you know, brother
[1:16:05] Brandham, he talks about this very
[1:16:07] scripture here. And he says that when it
[1:16:09] came to pass that the sun went down and
[1:16:11] it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace
[1:16:14] was a type of death, death to oneself,
[1:16:18] the separation of the body and the soul
[1:16:21] and the spirit. There had to be a time
[1:16:24] where there was an experience of death.
[1:16:27] And the only reason for that was so that
[1:16:29] that life in the pillar of fire could
[1:16:32] actually come and pass through. It could
[1:16:35] happen in the daytime, but would you be
[1:16:37] able to see it? We don't know. But it
[1:16:40] was actually a type of death is what
[1:16:42] brother Brandham says in this in this
[1:16:44] message that we're going to get into
[1:16:46] today. But I just love it in verse 18.
[1:16:49] In the same day the Lord made a covenant
[1:16:51] with Abraham, saying, "Unto thy seed
[1:16:53] have I given this land from the river of
[1:16:55] Egypt unto the great river, the river
[1:16:57] Euphrates." And that was given the
[1:16:59] promised land. That was the dedication,
[1:17:01] God's covenant. It was unconditional to
[1:17:03] the children of Israel. And the
[1:17:04] beautiful thing is it's still in force
[1:17:06] today, brothers and sisters.
[1:17:10] And I'm not political. I'm not going to
[1:17:11] get politically charged, but I'm going
[1:17:13] to say this because it's according to
[1:17:14] the word of God. They've been struggling
[1:17:16] and striving for decades, probably even
[1:17:18] centuries, for some kind of a
[1:17:20] multi-state solution. They're never
[1:17:22] going to have it. It's never going to
[1:17:25] happen. It will never ever happen. Why?
[1:17:28] Because it's the word of God. That land
[1:17:30] is not given to two states. It's not
[1:17:33] given to all of these other inhabitants.
[1:17:36] That land is given to one group of
[1:17:38] people according to the word of God. And
[1:17:41] it doesn't matter what happens, whatever
[1:17:42] we try and do. Doesn't matter what great
[1:17:44] leader gets involved and whatever they
[1:17:46] try and do. Doesn't matter what anybody
[1:17:48] on earth says or does because God has
[1:17:51] spoke. His word will never fail.
[1:17:57] But there has to come a time where
[1:17:58] there's a death, a burial,
[1:18:02] then there'll be a resurrection. And we
[1:18:04] know that Jesus was another part of the
[1:18:07] covenant that was given and and that
[1:18:09] happens. But you know, I just I just
[1:18:11] where I got inspired for this, I'll tell
[1:18:12] you, was the the covenant of marriage,
[1:18:15] talking about marriage and and how
[1:18:17] marriage is actually a covenant and it's
[1:18:19] not a contract. It's not a contract.
[1:18:22] It's not an obligation. It's not
[1:18:24] something that we just do just because.
[1:18:28] It's an actual unconditional covenant.
[1:18:32] It's our unconditional love. And I I
[1:18:34] just got so inspired with this, how the
[1:18:38] covenant is so beautiful because it's
[1:18:41] not something that you can just enull.
[1:18:43] And and some people will say, "Well, you
[1:18:45] sure can." Well, you can in the world,
[1:18:47] but when you're married before God, when
[1:18:49] you give your vows before God, guess
[1:18:52] what? You've made those vows.
[1:18:56] And and you know, Brother Brandham says
[1:18:58] it in the message that we don't want to
[1:18:59] say something. We don't want to make a
[1:19:00] vow to God and then go back on that vow.
[1:19:04] We don't want to do that. And you know,
[1:19:06] when we make a vow before God, it is
[1:19:08] done. It's permanent. And I know there's
[1:19:11] some that say, well, it could be anulled
[1:19:12] and you know, it could be just as well
[1:19:14] with Jesus Christ in our lives as well.
[1:19:16] And I can't help but think about how our
[1:19:18] salvation is a covenant because we are
[1:19:20] the bride of Jesus Christ. And many
[1:19:22] times we love to fit ourselves into that
[1:19:24] category. But boy oh boy, who has the
[1:19:27] right to put us away? If anyone has the
[1:19:29] right to put us away as a wife, it would
[1:19:31] be Jesus Christ. But here we are today,
[1:19:34] brothers and sisters, encouraging one
[1:19:36] another around this thought that this
[1:19:38] covenant that I'm inspired by is not a
[1:19:40] conditional covenant. If you do, I will.
[1:19:43] That's the Old Testament law. We are
[1:19:45] living under a new covenant. I don't
[1:19:47] want to dwell on this old covenant
[1:19:49] today. We're starting there, but we're
[1:19:51] going to move into a new covenant or a
[1:19:54] new testament is what brother Bradom
[1:19:56] talks about. We don't want to live under
[1:19:58] the Old Testament law. I mean, some
[1:20:00] people do. you see them, they're
[1:20:01] legalists and they just want to
[1:20:03] continually dwell there. And if your
[1:20:05] skirt isn't long enough, if your heels
[1:20:07] are too high, if your hair, if whatever
[1:20:10] it is you're doing doesn't measure up to
[1:20:12] what their spiritual ideology matches
[1:20:14] to, then there's a problem. But what's
[1:20:17] happening is those people are actually
[1:20:19] living under the wrong covenant
[1:20:22] because it needs to be the life of Jesus
[1:20:23] Christ. We can bring people through the
[1:20:25] door here and say, "You don't do this,
[1:20:28] you can't do that, you shouldn't do the
[1:20:29] other." and God will bless you and
[1:20:31] they'll do it for a time,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; but then eventually those devils that
[1:20:36] will come down upon their sacrifice will
[1:20:38] know there's something wrong with that
[1:20:40] foundation. It's a legalistic Old
[1:20:42] Testament covenant that won't stand in a
[1:20:45] day of a New Testament new covenant
[1:20:48] that's absolutely unconditional if
[1:20:50] you're following his word.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But marriage is a covenant. It's
[1:20:56] something that we enter into and it's
[1:20:57] for life.
[1:20:59] It's absolutely for life. And you know,
[1:21:03] the the word of God says it that if we
[1:21:05] actually go and get another spouse, and
[1:21:09] some will say, you know, well, it does
[1:21:11] say it in in Romans that if a man takes
[1:21:14] a woman who has a living husband,
[1:21:18] she shall be called an adulteress.
[1:21:20] And you know, that's the word of God.
[1:21:22] That's true. It's 100% true. But you
[1:21:25] know, I think it's important how brother
[1:21:27] Brandham brings it in the invisible
[1:21:28] union of the bride. It's so amazingly
[1:21:30] beautiful when you listen to that
[1:21:31] message because he talks about our
[1:21:34] spiritual covenant in that message in
[1:21:37] the invisible union of the bride. And
[1:21:39] I'll say this, I say it a lot. I'm going
[1:21:41] to continue to say it because I believe
[1:21:42] the Lord's revealed it to me. The
[1:21:44] invisible union of the bride of Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ, it comes to a place in the life
[1:21:50] of a believer's life where it's not
[1:21:52] invisible.
[1:21:54] And sometimes people will say, "It's the
[1:21:56] invisible union, brother Barry. It's the
[1:21:58] invisible union." Well, it becomes
[1:21:59] visible after a while because what
[1:22:01] happens is it's not actually you living
[1:22:03] out. It's Jesus Christ, the life of God,
[1:22:06] literally living out through the body of
[1:22:09] his bride on earth.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And we can claim Christianity all we
[1:22:15] want, but what's the life we live?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Because we know it. We hear it many
[1:22:19] times. Talk is cheap, isn't it? And
[1:22:22] that's what turns kids off of this
[1:22:24] message of the hour. The people that
[1:22:26] talk spirituality. I'm I'm a Christian.
[1:22:29] I'm a message believer. But then I'll go
[1:22:31] and just do a dirty deal behind the
[1:22:33] scenes and the children will hear about
[1:22:34] it about how good we scored. We scored
[1:22:36] today or mistreat the wife or mistreat
[1:22:40] the husband or smack talk the brother
[1:22:41] and the sister in the church. You know
[1:22:43] those meal time conversations brother
[1:22:45] Brandham talked about is what happened
[1:22:47] when the she bears came out when God's
[1:22:49] prophet got upset and and they said go
[1:22:51] up baldhead. How come didn't you go up
[1:22:53] Elisha like your leader? Oh my. If you
[1:22:55] would have been spiritual like him you
[1:22:57] would have gone up too. But he had a
[1:22:59] commission to fulfill. Brother Bradam
[1:23:01] said it that those parents are
[1:23:02] responsible for the deaths of their
[1:23:05] children because of the conversations
[1:23:07] they were having about God's prophet.
[1:23:11] And don't think it's any different
[1:23:12] today. Those devils are going to come
[1:23:14] around and eat your kids' lunch if
[1:23:16] you're going to be smack talking about
[1:23:17] the ministry.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Don't think it's just about the prophet.
[1:23:21] God has a five-fold ministry.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to eat our lunch. He
[1:23:29] wants to devour us. And you know, I
[1:23:33] think it's so beautiful because if we
[1:23:34] are truly sons and daughters of God, he
[1:23:36] can't.
[1:23:38] Woo. But we're going to go down a bumpy
[1:23:39] road if we don't listen to them.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; But you know, marriage is an
[1:23:45] unconditional covenant. And when we
[1:23:46] enter into it, it doesn't matter. I know
[1:23:49] brother Brandham says it in the message.
[1:23:50] You know, if his wife went out and
[1:23:52] cheated on him,
[1:23:54] she she he would probably take her back.
[1:23:56] He he wouldn't put her out. You know, he
[1:23:59] talks about it in such a way that if he
[1:24:00] were to go over to a foreign land and
[1:24:03] they lived in a marriage that was maybe
[1:24:06] not unconditional
[1:24:08] and how she would say to him, he would
[1:24:11] say to her first, "Now, while I go away,
[1:24:14] you better keep yourself pure. You
[1:24:16] better not go out and party. You better
[1:24:19] blah blah blah." I'm just paraphrasing
[1:24:21] just for the discussion. and and he
[1:24:24] said, "Yep, she would hear that and she
[1:24:27] would probably grab me by the lapel and
[1:24:29] pull me in close and say, "Now you
[1:24:31] listen here, my husband, while you're
[1:24:34] out there in the different land, and
[1:24:35] nobody can see where you're at, what
[1:24:37] hotel you're at, and on and on and on.
[1:24:39] You better not be seeing other women,
[1:24:41] going out for dinner, and all this
[1:24:43] stuff." And he said, "What kind of a
[1:24:45] marriage would that be? What kind of a
[1:24:47] family would that be?" Now brothers and
[1:24:50] sisters, he's talking about that in a
[1:24:52] natural realm. But I want to take it and
[1:24:54] let's just step it up a little bit and
[1:24:56] talk about it from a spiritual element.
[1:24:59] Sometimes I think we look at our
[1:25:01] salvation from that perspective
[1:25:04] where it's conditional. Could you
[1:25:06] imagine living in a conditional marriage
[1:25:09] where it's always tit for tat, pardon
[1:25:11] the term, you did this, so I get to do
[1:25:14] that
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and then the other. What kind of a life
[1:25:16] is that? What about laying our lives
[1:25:19] down for one another just like Jesus
[1:25:21] Christ laid his life down for us?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my, my wife's going to get more out
[1:25:27] of me. I'm going to vacuum more or I'm
[1:25:29] going to do this more. My wife, I did
[1:25:31] this and that and the other and she
[1:25:33] hasn't done anything.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So what?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; It's awfully quiet. Now the brothers are
[1:25:40] now the brothers are saying, you know,
[1:25:42] Brother Barry, you're picking on us.
[1:25:47] Hey, we're the feminine, right?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Think about our husband and what he did
[1:25:51] for us.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; How many of us would let people tear out
[1:25:54] our beard without lashing out?
[1:25:59] How many people would let someone slap
[1:26:01] us in the head? We know what Jesus went
[1:26:04] through for his bride. How could we have
[1:26:06] have just unrelenting, rigid behavior
[1:26:09] towards our brides? It doesn't make
[1:26:12] sense, does it? I I just don't
[1:26:16] understand it. I believe it's a
[1:26:17] traditional thing. I don't think Brother
[1:26:19] Brandham was that way at all. Not at
[1:26:21] all. I think it's somewhere somehow
[1:26:24] someone something happened and they
[1:26:26] started to actually behave this way and
[1:26:28] it just became a thing. You know what?
[1:26:31] Our wives are not doormats.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Our wives are to be cherished.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; But our salvation is just as much of a
[1:26:41] covenant
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; as our marriages.
[1:26:44] Could you imagine if we treated oursel
[1:26:46] if God treated our salvation the way we
[1:26:48] treat our marriage?
[1:26:50] It's quiet. Can you imagine it? And and
[1:26:54] I say that because there's times I'm not
[1:26:57] going to lie, we've had troubles. It
[1:27:00] hasn't been a bed of roses.
[1:27:04] When you go through things in life,
[1:27:05] that's when the real you comes out.
[1:27:11] And I ain't talking about little things.
[1:27:14] And I mean little things. You know,
[1:27:16] maybe some of the bumpy things that we
[1:27:18] just encounter in our lives where it
[1:27:19] becomes frustrating when when you start
[1:27:22] to actually go through
[1:27:24] deep things.
[1:27:26] It can really challenge you in ways that
[1:27:29] you never even imagined.
[1:27:31] But you know, God allows those things so
[1:27:34] that he can prove his word.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; And one time I'm going to preach on it.
[1:27:38] I've got a note in here. I was I was
[1:27:40] just talking to someone. I just got so
[1:27:42] inspired. How many times do we try and
[1:27:45] prove God's word in our lives? He don't
[1:27:48] need nobody to prove his word. The only
[1:27:51] thing we need to do is just be obedient
[1:27:53] to his word. And when we're obedient to
[1:27:56] his word, then he'll prove his word
[1:27:57] through us.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we want to see God move in
[1:28:02] our life. We want to be able to see the
[1:28:05] power of God in our life. We want to be
[1:28:07] able to make God move in our life. And
[1:28:09] we're not going to be able to do
[1:28:11] anything except for believe his word.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; But it's through the fiery trials that
[1:28:16] we really see who is who. And and I know
[1:28:20] for sure that when we go through a real
[1:28:22] fiery trial beyond what we ever thought
[1:28:25] we would go through, and we find
[1:28:27] ourselves
[1:28:29] in church, still wanting to worship God,
[1:28:32] still loving him because he is our God,
[1:28:36] still recognizing that it's an
[1:28:37] unconditional covenant. It really is the
[1:28:40] grace of God to us. Because many people
[1:28:43] would burn up through the fiery trials,
[1:28:46] but it's his gold. It's so beautiful.
[1:28:49] his character. Our salvation, brothers
[1:28:51] and sisters, is a covenant and it's an
[1:28:53] unconditional covenant.
[1:28:55] You know, this word covenant is H1285.
[1:28:58] It's bareth out of the uh concordance,
[1:29:02] Strong's concordance. And uh you know,
[1:29:04] it's from 1262 in the sense of cutting a
[1:29:08] compact
[1:29:09] because made by passing between pieces
[1:29:12] of flesh,
[1:29:15] confederacy, covenant, league. I just
[1:29:18] can't help but think it is absolutely
[1:29:20] when we can see this as a covenant, our
[1:29:22] salvation as a covenant. Brothers and
[1:29:25] sisters, remember this. It is com a
[1:29:29] compact by passing between pieces of
[1:29:32] flesh.
[1:29:34] It's passing between our soul and our
[1:29:37] spirit. It goes beyond our flesh. It
[1:29:40] goes beyond what we sense in our five
[1:29:43] outer senses. And it goes beyond even
[1:29:46] what we sense in our five inner senses.
[1:29:49] And it moves into that sixth sense.
[1:29:52] That's the realm of covenant. We're
[1:29:54] talking about the word of God being
[1:29:57] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:29:59] two-edged sword. Being able to get right
[1:30:02] into the very soul of a man to discern
[1:30:05] his thoughts.
[1:30:07] But, you know, talking about this guy
[1:30:10] Abram,
[1:30:11] I just think it's beautiful. We we have
[1:30:13] the story this morning in revelation or
[1:30:15] sorry in uh Genesis 15 how God came and
[1:30:18] actually instructed Abram first and then
[1:30:20] he actually followed his word and then
[1:30:22] he came down and confirmed his
[1:30:24] instruction in his life. We know that he
[1:30:27] told them here that you're going to
[1:30:29] actually have a seed that will be
[1:30:32] greater than the stars in the sky and
[1:30:34] the sand of the sea. You're going to
[1:30:36] have that promised son. We know that he
[1:30:38] tried to do it on his own by listening
[1:30:40] to his wife. And we know that that
[1:30:42] became a bit of a mess. But it was
[1:30:44] actually according to the word of God.
[1:30:46] It wasn't his will. But God took that
[1:30:48] and actually made it something that we
[1:30:51] can see today.
[1:30:53] But God before all of that came, before
[1:30:56] the promised son came, I just think it's
[1:30:58] beautiful how he came and he actually
[1:31:01] vindicated his promise. He came down to
[1:31:04] Abram and said, "Did you remember? Did
[1:31:07] you remember my covenant with you? He
[1:31:09] gave him the covenant, but then he came
[1:31:11] and he actually met him personally in
[1:31:14] the plains of memory. And you know, this
[1:31:16] is just over a little further in uh the
[1:31:19] book of Genesis. We're not going to read
[1:31:21] it today for the sake of discussion. I
[1:31:23] just want to be able to move forward
[1:31:24] with this idea uh of the covenant, but
[1:31:27] how God comes down. He'll give us the
[1:31:29] covenant. He'll let us know, but then
[1:31:30] he'll come by our way. We don't know
[1:31:33] when. We don't know where. We don't know
[1:31:34] how, but he always does it. And here we
[1:31:37] have Abram just going about his
[1:31:39] business. He's in this the door of his
[1:31:42] tent in the heat of the day. And what
[1:31:44] happens? Three men appeared is what the
[1:31:46] word of God says. And he said to Abram,
[1:31:51] "I've come to visit you according to the
[1:31:53] time of life." And we know that Abram in
[1:31:56] that time he saw one. And we know Lot he
[1:32:00] saw two. That was the the the course of
[1:32:04] action that was going to take place.
[1:32:06] They came and they met Abram first and
[1:32:08] Abram was able to fellowship with them.
[1:32:10] What was that meeting like? Every time I
[1:32:12] think about this, I just can't help but
[1:32:14] pause there and just just think about
[1:32:16] that. What would it be like to actually
[1:32:18] hustle out to the herd and get the
[1:32:20] fattest calf and and give it to a man, a
[1:32:23] young lad, and get him to dress it out
[1:32:25] and get get your wife to go and and
[1:32:28] churn some butter quick and maybe make
[1:32:30] some bread, get things fixed up and hope
[1:32:32] that these men are still sitting in the
[1:32:34] yard out front waiting for you to come
[1:32:36] back? Cuz how long would all that take?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It would take a while. Even today with
[1:32:42] all of our luxurious technology to go
[1:32:45] and slaughter a calf and to get some
[1:32:47] butter and bake some bread and then cook
[1:32:50] the calf, it would take some time.
[1:32:51] They'd be hours.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; But here he was just hanging out in the
[1:32:56] heat of the day. And God came to visit
[1:33:00] him.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Elohim,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared to him." And this is
[1:33:06] in Genesis
[1:33:08] just a little further. But in Genesis
[1:33:11] chapter 17
[1:33:14] verse 10,
[1:33:16] it says, "This is my covenant which ye
[1:33:19] shall keep."
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; God giving his covenant to his man. We
[1:33:26] know that he actually was 99 years old.
[1:33:30] And I don't believe that he actually had
[1:33:33] the promised son yet, but here he is in
[1:33:36] in a position where God is ready to give
[1:33:39] him the promise, but he makes sure that
[1:33:42] he's ready for it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; He wants him to know that because of my
[1:33:47] covenant, I'm going to give you a mark.
[1:33:50] I'm going to set a seal upon you that's
[1:33:53] going to prove my covenant with you. In
[1:33:55] Genesis 17:10, this is my covenant which
[1:33:57] ye shall keep between me and you, and
[1:33:59] thy seed. After thee, every manchild
[1:34:02] among you shall be circumcised. And we
[1:34:04] know that Abraham was 99 years old.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; This is a very important part of even
[1:34:11] the Hebrew life today and and many other
[1:34:13] humans lives, this mark in the flesh.
[1:34:17] And we know that it is still in force
[1:34:20] for the Jews. But Paul came around and
[1:34:23] he said very clearly in in the New
[1:34:26] Testament under the New Covenant that
[1:34:28] whether you are or you aren't, it
[1:34:30] doesn't matter because Jesus Christ came
[1:34:33] and actually gave us a new covenant
[1:34:36] which is the New Testament.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But I just want to pause here for a
[1:34:41] second because it is the word of God. I
[1:34:44] just want to take some time and dwell on
[1:34:45] this for a little bit. We know that it's
[1:34:47] not going to do us any good to to be
[1:34:49] circumcised or not circumcised. That's
[1:34:51] not going to change God's covenant with
[1:34:53] us because we are under a new covenant
[1:34:55] which is the New Testament.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; But it's interesting because if you look
[1:34:59] at the children of Israel when they
[1:35:01] actually went across when they were
[1:35:03] delivered after their bondage a after
[1:35:06] all that they went through what God
[1:35:08] showed Abram they would do all of their
[1:35:10] seed after they came out of Egypt they
[1:35:12] were delivered of their bondage. They
[1:35:14] went through the sea. They brother
[1:35:16] Brandham talks about it. They were born
[1:35:18] again. They were baptized in the sea and
[1:35:20] they were now positionally being placed
[1:35:23] in the land. And before they could
[1:35:25] actually go forwards, what did God say?
[1:35:29] He said to him, Joshua,
[1:35:33] you need to take and get everyone in
[1:35:35] line with my word.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; You've forgotten my covenant. My
[1:35:40] covenant is still in force.
[1:35:43] and the gentile traditions of the lands
[1:35:46] have crept into the church and caused it
[1:35:49] to become just a little bit lax and just
[1:35:51] a little bit lukewarm and maybe just a
[1:35:53] little bit powerless. And you need to
[1:35:55] get back in line with the word so that
[1:35:57] you can actually be blessed before you
[1:36:00] enter into that promised land. I just
[1:36:02] can't help but think, brothers and
[1:36:04] sisters, even though the covenant was
[1:36:05] there and it was unconditional, there
[1:36:07] was a sign that God gave them in their
[1:36:09] flesh. And today there is a sign that
[1:36:11] God gives us in our flesh. And what that
[1:36:14] sign is is not that our flesh changes.
[1:36:16] It's that our nature changes. That we
[1:36:18] get a true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:20] But the only way that happens is to
[1:36:22] submit ourselves fully unto the word of
[1:36:25] God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And I want to preach it this way today,
[1:36:28] brothers and sisters. We can say, I
[1:36:30] believe the message of the hour. I serve
[1:36:32] God. I've got tenure. I've got
[1:36:35] investment. I've got all this stuff. But
[1:36:37] how do we live our lives according to
[1:36:39] the word of God? Do we love our wives?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Because how we live our lives according
[1:36:45] to the word of God is how we serve God.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Now, we might say, "Wow, we do a lot of
[1:36:51] service for the kingdom of God." Maybe
[1:36:52] we do. But if we don't serve God
[1:36:54] according to his word, it doesn't matter
[1:36:57] what we do.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; We've got to live our lives exactly
[1:37:00] according to his word. And that is the
[1:37:02] mark of his life in us is that we will
[1:37:06] be obedient sons and daughters to his
[1:37:08] word.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; We won't say, "Well, you know, I could
[1:37:11] just I could just deal with it a little
[1:37:13] bit later." The children of Israel, if
[1:37:14] they didn't follow God's word, they
[1:37:16] weren't going into their promised land.
[1:37:17] And even if they did go into their
[1:37:19] promised land, we know it's probably
[1:37:21] likely that the enemy would have their
[1:37:23] way.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; True. But it was important for them to
[1:37:26] actually just stop, maybe take a step
[1:37:29] back and just recalibrate with the word
[1:37:31] of God
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; and say, "Okay, let's go through the
[1:37:33] camp." And anybody that needs to make it
[1:37:35] right, just make it right.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a doctor and a nurse
[1:37:40] down at the end. Anybody who needs it
[1:37:42] can just go and do it. And we'll all
[1:37:44] wait patiently for you
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; because we want success, don't we?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; We want God's blessing in our life. I
[1:37:51] can't help but think, brothers and
[1:37:52] sisters, sometimes in the church of the
[1:37:54] living God, maybe we just need to stop,
[1:37:56] take a step backwards and say, "If
[1:37:58] someone needs help, if someone's
[1:38:00] hurting, just come and actually get that
[1:38:03] help."
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Say the word. He's able to deliver us.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And then we can all just go forwards
[1:38:10] together.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And inherit our promised land.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But let's uh let's turn over in our
[1:38:17] Bibles to Jeremiah.
[1:38:21] Jeremiah chapter 31.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah
[1:38:35] chapter 31 verse 31 should be easy to
[1:38:39] remember.
[1:38:44] Behold
[1:38:46] the days come saith the Lord.
[1:38:50] that I will make a new covenant with the
[1:38:53] house of Israel and with the house of
[1:38:56] Judah.
[1:38:58] Can you imagine what this must have been
[1:39:00] like to hear for the believers in their
[1:39:03] day? Those who actually listened to
[1:39:07] God's prophet in that day. Most of the
[1:39:09] church didn't listen to God's prophet in
[1:39:10] that day. And we know that Israel was
[1:39:13] completely sacked.
[1:39:15] And uh we're not going to go too far
[1:39:16] into that, but what it would have been
[1:39:18] like to hear God's prophet say this.
[1:39:20] There's going to be a what? A new
[1:39:22] covenant.
[1:39:25] Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
[1:39:27] that I will make a new covenant with the
[1:39:29] house of Israel and with the house of
[1:39:31] Judah,
[1:39:33] not according to the covenant that I
[1:39:35] made with their fathers in the day that
[1:39:37] I took them by the hand to bring them
[1:39:40] out of the land of Egypt, which my
[1:39:42] covenant they break,
[1:39:45] although I was an husband to them, saith
[1:39:49] the Lord.
[1:39:51] But this shall be the covenant that I
[1:39:54] will make with the house of Israel.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; After those days, saith the Lord, I will
[1:40:01] put my law in their inward parts and
[1:40:05] write it in their hearts,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; and I will be their God, and they shall
[1:40:10] be my people.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Now remember, this is to the house of
[1:40:15] Israel, but every scripture has a
[1:40:17] compound meaning and revelation. And I
[1:40:20] believe we can take this and put it in
[1:40:22] our lives. We can put ourselves there
[1:40:24] and say, "Yeah, has anybody had him put
[1:40:29] his law in your inward parts?" And you
[1:40:32] know, brothers and sisters, when the
[1:40:33] Holy Ghost comes into our life, that's
[1:40:34] exactly what happens.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; But I just can't help but think when you
[1:40:39] see the legalists, that hasn't happened
[1:40:41] yet.
[1:40:43] True.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; It hasn't happened yet because they
[1:40:45] still have their list on the outward
[1:40:46] parts.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And they're still looking at all of the
[1:40:49] outward parts.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; God's not looking at the outward parts.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; He's looking at the inward parts.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandham says what
[1:40:58] happens is this uh this word that we're
[1:41:00] talking about, this law that we're
[1:41:02] speaking about, it will actually wash us
[1:41:05] white from the inside out.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; It won't whitewash us from the outside
[1:41:11] in. We know that that will fade because
[1:41:14] of that filthy oil that's in our bodies.
[1:41:17] We know that Job said, "The worms are
[1:41:19] already in me. The skin worms are
[1:41:20] already This flesh will never in inherit
[1:41:23] incorruption, brothers and sisters. This
[1:41:24] flesh has to perish
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; one way or another. It's got to go to
[1:41:28] the grave or or it just needs to
[1:41:29] vaporize." But I just love this covenant
[1:41:32] and and the study of this covenant
[1:41:33] because it's unconditional and how God
[1:41:35] takes it and makes it, but then he comes
[1:41:38] around and says, "I know that you can't
[1:41:39] live it. I knew that you couldn't live
[1:41:41] it, but I knew that it would shake down
[1:41:43] enough people to come to the place where
[1:41:45] they'll recognize my new covenant and
[1:41:47] they will appreciate it and they will
[1:41:48] rejoice in it and they will actually be
[1:41:51] able to accept it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; But this shall be the covenant that I
[1:41:57] will make with the house of Israel.
[1:41:59] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I can't help but think he says that with
[1:42:02] his bride today. This will be the
[1:42:04] covenant that I will make with them
[1:42:07] after those days, sayaeth the Lord, I
[1:42:09] will put my law in their inward parts
[1:42:11] and write it in their hearts. And what
[1:42:13] will happen is they will just begin to
[1:42:15] live the life.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; They won't be looking to study out in a
[1:42:19] book and to get a quote and to have a
[1:42:21] quote versus quote.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Verse 34. And they shall teach no more
[1:42:29] every man his neighbor. They won't be
[1:42:32] busy bodies going around looking at
[1:42:34] everyone else
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; and looking at every other church and
[1:42:37] looking at all the different things and
[1:42:39] trying to make it the way they think it
[1:42:41] should be.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; They'll teach no more every man his
[1:42:45] neighbor and every man his brother
[1:42:47] saying know the Lord.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; You get to know him.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; He'll change. He'll rewire the way you
[1:42:54] think.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; He'll rewire the way you worship. He
[1:42:58] will completely change the way you come
[1:43:00] to church.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; For they shall all know me.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I love this. From the least of them unto
[1:43:07] the greatest of them, saith the Lord.
[1:43:10] Why?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; For I will forgive their iniquity.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? We talked about
[1:43:18] this on Wednesday, that iniquity thing.
[1:43:20] And I'll tell you, I never studied this
[1:43:22] out to iniquity. This is the Lord
[1:43:24] weaving it together. He is the one that
[1:43:26] will forgive the iniquity, brothers and
[1:43:28] sisters, that started in heaven from
[1:43:30] that one that was the covenant angel. Oh
[1:43:32] my, he had everything perfect in his
[1:43:35] life. All that he had was perfect. All
[1:43:39] of his ways were perfect. All of his
[1:43:40] worship was perfect. You can imagine his
[1:43:43] hair was perfect.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Everything in his life was perfect
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; except for one thing.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; We read about it. It was iniquity.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And you know, there's no forgiveness for
[1:43:53] his iniquity.
[1:43:55] And I can't help but think it's
[1:43:56] vengeance of the Lord, isn't it?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if someone came around
[1:44:01] and tried to give your wife a bundle of
[1:44:03] iniquity and she accepted it because she
[1:44:06] was out from where you were at the
[1:44:08] moment? What would your vengeance be
[1:44:11] like on that person?
[1:44:14] That kind of thing. You'd be like, there
[1:44:15] was no forgiveness, unfortunately. And I
[1:44:18] mean, we're supposed to forgive, but
[1:44:19] just look at it from him as a husband,
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; her as the wife, Satan coming around and
[1:44:26] trying to give it to her.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Deceiving her.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; I just love this scripture. And they
[1:44:34] shall teach no more, every man his
[1:44:35] neighbor, every man his brother, saying,
[1:44:38] "Know the Lord,
[1:44:41] for they shall all know me." Yes.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think, brothers and
[1:44:46] sisters, everyone of the bride of Jesus
[1:44:48] Christ shall know him.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be ignorance here.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; We're all going to have that same
[1:44:57] experience.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be that old time
[1:45:00] religion, isn't it?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; My
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; They shall all know me from the least of
[1:45:07] them unto the greatest of them, sayaeth
[1:45:09] the Lord. for I will forgive their
[1:45:11] iniquity and I will remember their sin
[1:45:15] no more.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Now, which one of us
[1:45:20] could dare
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; hold on to iniquity or offenses in our
[1:45:26] own marriages
[1:45:28] or in our relationships with brothers or
[1:45:32] sisters?
[1:45:34] Which one of us would dare do that? How
[1:45:37] could we do that? I'll say it. Maybe we
[1:45:41] just haven't gotten to know him just
[1:45:43] enough.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; It just hasn't become intimate enough.
[1:45:47] Brothers and sisters, there has to be an
[1:45:49] intimate relationship with the Lord
[1:45:51] Jesus Christ. And what happens is there
[1:45:54] becomes a new birth.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why what happened in
[1:45:58] the Garden of Eden happened in the
[1:46:00] Garden of Eden. And that's why the whole
[1:46:02] denominational world, religion in
[1:46:04] general, has taken it and dumbed it
[1:46:06] down, for lack of a better term, to some
[1:46:09] sort of fruit that was eaten.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; How could eating fruit take mankind and
[1:46:13] throw them into the transgression and
[1:46:15] bring death into the human race?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; because what happened was an encounter.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was actually a sexual affair
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; because the serpent was cursed
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; to be the serpent.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; He wasn't created to be the snake
[1:46:37] serpent that we know as serpent.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; That was his curse. Remember?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; So what was he before the curse?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. We know it.
[1:46:46] I'm preaching to the choir here. But
[1:46:48] there could be someone that just maybe
[1:46:49] has never understood this.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. From
[1:46:57] the greatest to the least, they shall
[1:46:59] know me, sayaeth the Lord, for I will
[1:47:02] forgive their iniquity, and I will
[1:47:04] remember their sin no more. You can see
[1:47:05] it when you have a believer
[1:47:08] when something happens, when an offense
[1:47:10] comes and you ask them, you know, I'm so
[1:47:11] sorry. Have I done this or whatever? And
[1:47:13] they might say, yeah, you know, there
[1:47:14] was this thing, but it's gone.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Where did it go?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; I can't help but think it went into the
[1:47:20] sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; But humanly speaking, we can't do that.
[1:47:24] And some people will say, "Well, brother
[1:47:25] Barry, I could bring out a quote that
[1:47:26] says, "The prophet says we can never
[1:47:28] forget." But we've talked about this.
[1:47:30] The devil comes around with a jar of
[1:47:32] memories and he wants to shake them and
[1:47:33] rattle them in our head. And we can
[1:47:35] choose to say, "Get lost, Satan. That's
[1:47:38] actually dealt with. It's under the
[1:47:39] blood. I put it out of my mind." Or I'm
[1:47:41] going to say, "No, no, no. Let's get out
[1:47:43] that jar." And I'm going to look at that
[1:47:44] memory. And you know, as I look at that
[1:47:46] one, it's going to remind me of the next
[1:47:47] one. And then it's going to remind me of
[1:47:48] the next one. And it's going to remind
[1:47:49] me of the next one. And before long, I
[1:47:51] become a bitter person in my heart.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And then we're exactly where the devil
[1:47:58] wants us to be. And alls it is, brothers
[1:47:59] and sisters, is a distraction because he
[1:48:01] can't change us from being a son and
[1:48:03] daughter of the most high God. Alls he
[1:48:05] can do is distract us.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And if he distracts us, then we're
[1:48:11] actually missing out on that blessing.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I just love this how there's a promise
[1:48:18] of a new covenant. Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; And you know that promise for the new
[1:48:23] covenant, it came right in the midst of
[1:48:25] a terrible, terrible tragedy.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it how in
[1:48:30] the Bible, you know, when the city was
[1:48:33] under siege,
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; the king of the north came just like the
[1:48:37] prophet said, you know what? If you
[1:48:38] don't repent,
[1:48:41] the king of the north, his fury is
[1:48:43] stirred up. God has stirred up his fury.
[1:48:47] It's ferocious. and he's going to come
[1:48:48] and he's not going to spare
[1:48:51] at all. And we know that the Bible says
[1:48:54] that there was those that were
[1:48:55] instructed to go through the land, three
[1:48:57] angels, two of them, and then another
[1:48:59] one who had an ink horn. And they were
[1:49:02] told to put a set a mark upon those who
[1:49:05] are sighing and crying for the
[1:49:06] abominations.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Bradom, he says that, you
[1:49:08] know, we can say, we say amen to the
[1:49:10] word of God, but which one of us are
[1:49:11] signing and crying for the abominations
[1:49:13] in the land?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; And where is the land, brothers and
[1:49:16] sisters? I don't want to say North
[1:49:17] America, even though it is. We're not
[1:49:19] talking about a geographical location.
[1:49:21] This is brother Barry's notes here. But
[1:49:23] you know what we're talking about is the
[1:49:25] land of the living God.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; He's trying to get through to his
[1:49:28] church. Are we sawing and crying for the
[1:49:30] abominations where people are actually
[1:49:32] taking and making the message of the
[1:49:34] hour something to suit their own
[1:49:35] lifestyle? Or are we actually getting on
[1:49:38] our knees and actually taking the time
[1:49:40] to intercede for our brothers and
[1:49:42] sisters? Because we recognize what's
[1:49:43] actually going on. We recognize what's
[1:49:45] at stake.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that time is short.
[1:49:49] Back in the 60s, back in the 50s, back
[1:49:52] in the 40s, it's later than we think.
[1:49:54] Where are we at today?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; But I can't help but think we're just
[1:50:00] living under that promise of a brand new
[1:50:01] covenant.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And many would say it's an old covenant,
[1:50:04] Brother Barry. Yeah, it is. But I think
[1:50:08] it's important for us to look at it this
[1:50:09] way that he said that even from the
[1:50:12] least of them unto the greatest of them,
[1:50:16] they will know me, saith the Lord.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; A prophecy.
[1:50:23] And this is well after the original
[1:50:25] covenant that was set. God who is rich
[1:50:29] in mercy comes around and in the midst
[1:50:32] of all of their sinful nature in the
[1:50:36] midst of the city being sacked
[1:50:39] starved out to the place where they
[1:50:41] start to boil each other's children to
[1:50:43] survive.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; His man, his prophet Jeremiah speaks
[1:50:49] these words, God's words to a few
[1:50:52] faithful people, very few faithful
[1:50:55] people. And isn't it interesting? The
[1:50:57] king of the land completely rejected the
[1:50:58] word of God in his day. The the king of
[1:51:01] the land was taken captive and and
[1:51:03] caught. And we know the king of the
[1:51:05] land, he actually was able to witness uh
[1:51:09] the king that took over. It's a terrible
[1:51:12] story. He said, you know, God actually
[1:51:14] allowed this to happen to him because he
[1:51:16] would not listen. He would not hearken
[1:51:18] to the word of the Lord through the
[1:51:19] vindicated prophet in his day. And God
[1:51:21] said, okay, if that's what you're going
[1:51:22] to do, then this is what you're going to
[1:51:24] get. The prophet even told him, "If you
[1:51:25] would just go out and surrender right
[1:51:27] now, you'll live the rest of your life
[1:51:28] as a slave,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; but you'll live."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't listen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; So God allowed the king that took them
[1:51:36] over to take them back and actually slay
[1:51:39] all of his sons in front of his eyes.
[1:51:41] And then he put his eyes out and said,
[1:51:42] "That's the last thing that you'll ever
[1:51:44] see
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; is the death of your children."
[1:51:47] And I can't help but think, brothers and
[1:51:49] sisters, if we're not willing to
[1:51:50] completely follow every single letter of
[1:51:52] the word of God from the vindicated
[1:51:54] prophet in our day, don't think that
[1:51:56] we're separate and we're special. The
[1:51:58] devil is going to come around and
[1:51:59] actually take our children's lives.
[1:52:01] They're not going to want to serve the
[1:52:02] Lord.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen is that's going
[1:52:05] to be the last thing that we see.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; We need to follow the word of a
[1:52:11] vindicated prophet, not try and make
[1:52:13] excuses for it and say that we can do it
[1:52:15] differently. True.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; We just need to humble ourselves in the
[1:52:18] sight of the Lord and he'll lift us up.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said that
[1:52:23] true revelation, true revelation.
[1:52:24] There's lots of revelation in this
[1:52:26] world, but there's true revelation. And
[1:52:28] I'll say this, too. There is baptism of
[1:52:30] the Holy Ghost, but there's true baptism
[1:52:32] of the Holy Ghost. Now, why do I say it
[1:52:34] that way? Because Brother Bradam says
[1:52:35] you could be baptized with the Holy
[1:52:37] Ghost every hour of your life and still
[1:52:39] go to hell.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; How does that work?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; You're living under the anointing. I
[1:52:44] can't help but think you're actually
[1:52:45] living off of someone else's experience
[1:52:47] in the church of the living God. We're
[1:52:49] around believers. We see a wonderful
[1:52:51] song service. There's many blessings
[1:52:52] that fall.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; But are we willing to humble ourselves
[1:52:57] completely to the word of a vindicated
[1:52:59] prophet in the day in which we live? If
[1:53:01] we're not, brothers and sisters, we are
[1:53:02] at great risk. I want to tell us we're
[1:53:04] at great risk. But if we do humble
[1:53:06] ourselves, then we got every single
[1:53:08] reason to rejoice.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; We got every single reason to run around
[1:53:12] the room. If we can't let off the
[1:53:13] pressure in here, then where can we do
[1:53:15] it?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Remember, we should be just as exuberant
[1:53:21] here
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; as they are
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; there.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; How exuberant do they get there?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, when you can recognize that he
[1:53:32] said to them, I will forgive their
[1:53:33] iniquity. There ain't no iniquity in
[1:53:35] your life. Even though we feel like, oh
[1:53:37] Lord, I need you to forgive my iniquity.
[1:53:39] Please take it out of the way. And I
[1:53:40] know there's much in my life. Brother
[1:53:43] Barry speaking here.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; My personal prayer.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I will forgive."
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; I I can't help but think, "I'll forgive
[1:53:52] your iniquity, Barry.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my." And and I will not remember any
[1:53:57] more of your sin, Barry. I can't help
[1:53:59] but think, let's just put our names
[1:54:00] there, brothers and sisters. He won't
[1:54:02] remember your iniquity. He won't hold
[1:54:04] your sin against you. He puts it into
[1:54:06] the sea of his forgetfulness.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. If we've got things
[1:54:12] in our lives, let's take them. If
[1:54:14] they're about other people, take them
[1:54:16] and throw them into the sea of God's
[1:54:17] forgetfulness right now. Don't hold on
[1:54:20] to it and see if God won't bless you in
[1:54:23] ways that you never imagined.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:54:27] is liberty, which is life. It's freedom.
[1:54:30] We're not under bondage anymore. I don't
[1:54:32] have to look at that memory. I don't
[1:54:34] have to let that thing haunt me.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; It's an evil spirit. Rebuke it in the
[1:54:38] name of Jesus. Give people forgiveness.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Forgive your spouse even if they
[1:54:44] continually do it to you.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, I'm
[1:54:50] going to say this and I hope it's okay.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Some people might not like it or
[1:54:54] whatever, but it's okay. I I'm I'm going
[1:54:57] to say I'm the pastor here, so Lord
[1:54:59] willing, we're going to do it. Sister
[1:55:01] Marian's auntie is going to come, Lord
[1:55:03] willing. Is Sister Marian here today?
[1:55:06] Brother Tabiso. Sister Marian, she's
[1:55:08] right there. Yeah, she texted me and
[1:55:09] said she's going to come. And when she
[1:55:12] does, I want her to give her testimony
[1:55:14] about Lord Stanley.
[1:55:17] She has a testimony that is unreal.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; A believing wife with a husband that
[1:55:24] doesn't believe,
[1:55:26] that drinks.
[1:55:27] I don't know if he still does, but
[1:55:30] there's a terrible, terrible time in
[1:55:32] their life. And she is dealing with the
[1:55:35] kids. And you should hear this woman
[1:55:37] talk because what does she do? She takes
[1:55:39] and just gives forgiveness. Continually
[1:55:41] forgiveness. He's my husband.
[1:55:43] Continually forgive him, Lord.
[1:55:45] Continually forgive him, Lord.
[1:55:47] Continually forgive him, Lord. And
[1:55:49] she'll fill in the blanks. But what an
[1:55:51] incredible testimony.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even changing his ways.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even changing his behavior. In
[1:56:00] fact, I think he was getting worse at
[1:56:01] times.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But she just kept forgiving him.
[1:56:05] and looking after him because why? It
[1:56:07] was her husband after all.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Imagine if we lived our lives that way.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I I just want to say it, brothers and
[1:56:14] sisters, there is a tremendous amount of
[1:56:16] power available to the church of the
[1:56:18] living God. But I'll tell you what, as
[1:56:20] long as we're holding on to junk in our
[1:56:22] lives, it is going to ground that power.
[1:56:24] We're going to walk around that power.
[1:56:25] We're going to pack that power. We're
[1:56:27] going to talk about that power. But as
[1:56:29] long as we're holding on to things in
[1:56:31] the past in our lives, that power is not
[1:56:33] going to be activated the way that we
[1:56:36] should be activating it the way that he
[1:56:38] wants to activate it in our lives.
[1:56:40] Remember, Brother Brandham said that
[1:56:41] we're living below our privileges,
[1:56:43] aren't we? What is it? A thousand miles
[1:56:44] below.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; but there's a promise of a new covenant.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; My Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 8
[1:56:56] as we start to change gears.
[1:56:59] certainly love the Lord.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 8.
[1:57:10] And you know, I I thought it was going
[1:57:12] to be a bit long, but I think it's okay.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; I could say a lot, and I usually do, I
[1:57:20] guess, but let's just let the Lord speak
[1:57:22] here.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 8.
[1:57:28] Paul's speaking to the Hebrews now of
[1:57:30] the things which we have spoken. This is
[1:57:33] the sum.
[1:57:36] We have such an high priest who is set
[1:57:39] on the right hand
[1:57:41] of the throne of the majesty in the
[1:57:43] heavens.
[1:57:45] A minister of the sanctuary and of the
[1:57:47] true tabernacle which the Lord pitched
[1:57:50] and not a man.
[1:57:54] So beautiful. For every high priest is
[1:57:57] ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices,
[1:58:00] wherefore it is of necess necessity that
[1:58:03] this man have somewhat also to offer.
[1:58:06] For if he were on earth, he should not
[1:58:09] be a priest, seeing that there are
[1:58:11] priests that offer gifts according to
[1:58:14] the law,
[1:58:16] who serve unto the example and shadow of
[1:58:20] heavenly things. as Moses was admonished
[1:58:24] of God when he was about to make the
[1:58:26] tabernacle.
[1:58:28] For see, saith he that thou make all
[1:58:31] things according to the pattern showed
[1:58:34] to thee in the mount. But now hath he
[1:58:38] obtained a more excellent ministry, by
[1:58:40] how much also he is the mediator of a
[1:58:44] better covenant, which was established
[1:58:48] upon better promises.
[1:58:52] For if that first covenant had been
[1:58:55] faultless,
[1:58:57] then should no place have been sought
[1:59:00] for the second.
[1:59:02] But finding fault with them,
[1:59:05] he saith, "Behold, the days come, saith
[1:59:08] the Lord, when I will make a new
[1:59:11] covenant with the house of Israel,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; and with the house of Judah."
[1:59:17] Now, here we have Paul
[1:59:19] admonishing the Hebrews,
[1:59:22] not with his own words.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; What he's doing is admonishing the
[1:59:27] Hebrews with the word of the vindicated
[1:59:31] prophet. Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Even though he himself is a vindicated
[1:59:35] prophet,
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; we know Amos 3:7, the the the the
[1:59:40] scripture there, it says, "Surely I'll
[1:59:42] do nothing unless I first reveal it unto
[1:59:46] my prophets, my servants, the prophets."
[1:59:48] Right?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; So, he's not bringing a new message.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; All he's doing is saying what we already
[1:59:54] read.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; That God gave Jeremiah.
[2:00:03] for finding fault with them. Verse
[2:00:04] eight, he saith, "Behold, the days come,
[2:00:06] sayaeth the Lord, when I will make a new
[2:00:08] covenant with the house of Israel and
[2:00:10] with the house of Judah, not according
[2:00:13] to the covenant that I made with their
[2:00:15] fathers in the day, when I took them by
[2:00:17] the hand, and led them out of the land
[2:00:19] of Egypt, because they continued not in
[2:00:22] my covenant, and and I regarded them
[2:00:26] not, saith the Lord.
[2:00:30] For this is the covenant that I will
[2:00:32] make with the house of Israel after
[2:00:35] those days, saith the Lord, I will put
[2:00:38] my laws into their mind
[2:00:42] and write them in their hearts.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And I love how he says this here because
[2:00:48] he just magnifies
[2:00:50] what Jeremiah said, right?
[2:00:54] I will put my laws into their mind will
[2:00:57] become mindful of the law
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; and there won't be a list of dos and
[2:01:02] don'ts on the outside.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; It will be inside us.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; I'll put my laws into their mind and
[2:01:09] write them in their hearts
[2:01:14] and I will be to them a god and they
[2:01:17] shall be to me a people.
[2:01:22] I just want to say this, brothers and
[2:01:23] sisters, as we read this, we know that
[2:01:26] God will put it into our mind. We can
[2:01:28] become mindful of the word of God,
[2:01:29] mindful of the message of the hour,
[2:01:31] mindful of the quotes,
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; mindful of our salvation, mindful of the
[2:01:35] new covenant, of the unconditional
[2:01:37] covenant, of the better covenant.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; We can be mindful of all of these
[2:01:42] things. He'll give it to us in our mind.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; But the true test is that it will
[2:01:48] actually be in our heart.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Remember, the longest journey of any
[2:01:52] human being is for this word to go from
[2:01:55] here
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; to here.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; The longest journey that we could ever
[2:01:59] take, the most adventurous journey that
[2:02:01] we could ever take is for that word to
[2:02:03] be hid in our heart that we might not
[2:02:05] sin against him. Amen.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; But you know many times we can have it
[2:02:10] in our minds but not have it right in
[2:02:13] our heart. And how will we know that?
[2:02:15] We'll know that by the response we get
[2:02:18] when someone or something speaks to us
[2:02:21] and brings correction according to that
[2:02:24] word that we have in our mind.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Because if it's in our heart if it's
[2:02:28] moved down into our heart, we'll say,
[2:02:30] "Oh Lord, forgive me. Brothers and
[2:02:32] sisters, please forgive me. I was wrong.
[2:02:34] I I stand corrected." or will say,
[2:02:37] "Nope, I've got it right that I'm going
[2:02:39] to take another step out on that limb.
[2:02:40] And I'm just going to keep stepping out
[2:02:42] on that limb, and I will not ever go
[2:02:44] back because I have too much what?
[2:02:46] Iniquity in my heart. I've got too much
[2:02:48] pride in my heart to actually go and
[2:02:51] repent."
[2:02:52] But I think it's amazing here. I will
[2:02:54] put my laws in their mind and write them
[2:02:56] in their hearts. And I will be to them a
[2:02:59] god, and they shall be to me a people.
[2:03:03] And they shall not teach every man his
[2:03:05] neighbor and every man his brother,
[2:03:09] saying, "Know the Lord." Oh my. For all
[2:03:11] shall know me. I just can't help but
[2:03:14] think that this is a perfect example of
[2:03:15] a believer,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's Brother George
[2:03:20] Smith that says it. You know, we should
[2:03:22] uh we should preach often
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; and once in a while when we need to, we
[2:03:27] should speak
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; because our lives actually preach.
[2:03:33] The life that we live preaches way
[2:03:35] louder
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; than all the words that come out of our
[2:03:37] mouth.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And they shall not teach every man his
[2:03:42] neighbor and every man his brother,
[2:03:44] saying, "Know the Lord,
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; for all shall know me
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; from the least to the greatest."
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 12, I think, is where it really
[2:03:52] becomes a little bit more real and
[2:03:54] tangible to us. the way that the Lord
[2:03:56] expresses the same word through his
[2:03:59] prophet for this day. For I will be
[2:04:01] merciful to their unrighteousness
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; and their sins and their iniquities will
[2:04:09] I remember no more.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. In that he saith, a new
[2:04:17] covenant,
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; he hath made the first old. Now that
[2:04:22] which decayth and waxth old is ready to
[2:04:26] vanish away.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful to see how the word
[2:04:35] of God moves. How God moves his word to
[2:04:40] accommodate his people to look after his
[2:04:42] people.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; But he's given a new covenant. Let's
[2:04:49] turn over to Hebrews chapter 10. Amen.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. I'm hoping that I
[2:05:00] can get us
[2:05:02] done at a decent time, but we'll just
[2:05:04] trust the Lord here.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10
[2:05:13] verse 11. I I just think it might be
[2:05:17] good. Maybe I'll just read verse one
[2:05:18] just to set the example and you know for
[2:05:20] the sake of time maybe if you desire to
[2:05:23] just read the rest of this when you go
[2:05:25] home. Hebrews chapter 10 verse one. For
[2:05:28] the law having a shadow of good things
[2:05:30] to come and not the very image of the
[2:05:34] things
[2:05:36] can never with those sacrifices which
[2:05:39] they offered year by year continually
[2:05:42] make the comers there onto perfect.
[2:05:46] Living according to the old covenant
[2:05:48] will never ever do it. It never could do
[2:05:52] it for them in the day in which we lived
[2:05:54] and it will never do it for us today. So
[2:05:57] why would we ever want to go back to a
[2:05:58] legalistic covenant? Why would we ever
[2:06:00] want to go back to live under the law is
[2:06:02] beyond me. I don't understand it. I I I
[2:06:06] guess I do, but I I think just for the
[2:06:07] sake of discussion, I think it's
[2:06:09] difficult to understand. when we have
[2:06:11] been given this glorious liberty of the
[2:06:14] freedom of the life of Jesus Christ
[2:06:16] living out through us through this
[2:06:18] message of the hour. Why would we want
[2:06:20] to go back to a legalistic perspective
[2:06:22] and think that's going to do anything
[2:06:24] good for anybody
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; when God who is rich in mercy
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; when when we were dead in sins and
[2:06:32] trespasses
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; oh my he considered us in our position
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; but in Hebrews chapter 10 here I just
[2:06:41] wanted to start reading with verse 11
[2:06:44] and every priest standeth daily
[2:06:47] ministering ing and offering oftent
[2:06:50] times the same sacrifices
[2:06:54] which can never take away sins.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; How many of us have gone on our knees
[2:06:59] and offered the same sacrifice over and
[2:07:02] over again and find ourselves doing it
[2:07:05] over and over again
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; because it never takes away the sin.
[2:07:12] Verse 12. But this man, after he had
[2:07:16] offered one sacrifice for sins forever,
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; sat down on the right hand of God,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; from henceforth, expecting till his
[2:07:26] enemies be made his foottool. For by one
[2:07:29] offering he hath perfected forever them
[2:07:32] that are sanctified.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Are we sanctified this morning? Amen.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Because if that's the case, then he has
[2:07:40] actually perfected us forever.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 15,
[2:07:47] whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[2:07:50] to us. And you know, brother Bradom says
[2:07:53] it this way. I think God through brother
[2:07:55] Bradom to this age. He says that the
[2:07:56] Holy Ghost is actually the earnest. The
[2:07:59] Holy Ghost is the down payment. It is
[2:08:02] our assurance that we have made it.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; That we have actually packed that box
[2:08:08] car to the place where the inspector has
[2:08:11] come around and shook it and said, "You
[2:08:13] know what?
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I am pleased with him. And I'm going to
[2:08:19] close that door myself and I'm going to
[2:08:22] put the seal on that door. And there
[2:08:24] ain't no devil in hell or in earth
[2:08:26] that's going to be able to mess with
[2:08:28] that load or that seal.
[2:08:32] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; This is our covenant, brothers and
[2:08:35] sisters.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that he's given it
[2:08:39] to us. And the only thing it takes for
[2:08:41] us is to believe it.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; If we really believe it, then we'll live
[2:08:47] it.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 15 says, "Whereof the Holy Ghost
[2:08:52] also is a witness to us. For after that
[2:08:57] he had said before, this is the covenant
[2:09:01] that I will make with them after those
[2:09:04] days, sayaeth the Lord, I will put my
[2:09:06] laws into their Isn't it interesting?
[2:09:08] It's the word of God being said over and
[2:09:11] over again.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; He's saying it for a reason, brothers
[2:09:14] and sisters. And now we can look at it
[2:09:16] from the perspective of the new
[2:09:18] covenant, which is the New Testament.
[2:09:21] And I want to say it this way, maybe the
[2:09:23] new testimony.
[2:09:25] the life of Jesus Christ living out
[2:09:27] through us.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; This is not about the Jews
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; in Israel.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; This is not about the Hebrews. This is
[2:09:35] not about Paul. This is not about
[2:09:37] Aranius. It's it's not about Luther.
[2:09:40] It's not about Wesley. It's not even
[2:09:42] about Brother Brandom. It's about you
[2:09:44] and I.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that I will make
[2:09:49] with them after those days, sayeth the
[2:09:51] Lord. I will put my laws into their
[2:09:53] hearts and in their minds will I write
[2:09:56] them.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about doing it.
[2:10:01] He will do it. I will put my laws in
[2:10:03] their hearts and in their minds will I
[2:10:06] write them and their sins and iniquities
[2:10:10] will I remember no more. We have read
[2:10:12] this three times this morning. How could
[2:10:15] we retain anything against anyone when
[2:10:18] he is not willing to retain anything
[2:10:20] against any one of us?
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I just believe the Lord is showing me
[2:10:28] this so loud and clear. Brothers and
[2:10:29] sisters, this is the trick of the devil
[2:10:30] for us to actually have something that
[2:10:32] we harbor.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; You hold on to something, you got a ball
[2:10:35] and chain, it's taken away your ability
[2:10:37] to fly.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; I want to say that we serve the God that
[2:10:41] is a chain breaker. Let's give him those
[2:10:44] chains and say, "Break those chains,
[2:10:46] Lord. I don't want to be bound down by
[2:10:48] this memory, by this situation, by this
[2:10:50] hurt, by whatever it is in my life any
[2:10:53] longer."
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz I guarantee you, when something's
[2:10:58] bugging you about someone, it's bugging
[2:10:59] them. And they might not know why. They
[2:11:01] might not understand what's going on.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; What does the word of God say? I want to
[2:11:06] say it. It doesn't say text them. It
[2:11:09] doesn't say call them. And it surely to
[2:11:12] goodness does not say send an email or a
[2:11:14] letter.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; It says go to him.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Now maybe you'll say, "Brother Barry, I
[2:11:20] can't I can't just go and book a ticket
[2:11:23] to go to a foreign land. Do you know how
[2:11:25] much money that will cost?
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know how much it will cost to
[2:11:29] retain that thing?"
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; True,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters, there ain't
[2:11:32] nothing that's worth holding on to any
[2:11:35] kind of hurt or problem.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this. If you've got
[2:11:38] something, if we've got something in our
[2:11:40] life with someone in a foreign land,
[2:11:42] think about it. If you take of your
[2:11:44] money and you stretch it to the last
[2:11:46] dollar, don't you think that God will
[2:11:48] honor that beyond your wildest dreams
[2:11:50] for you to say, "I'm willing to take the
[2:11:52] sacrifice and to lay it out before you,
[2:11:55] and I'm going to trust with all of my
[2:11:57] heart that your pillar of fire is going
[2:11:59] to come down and examine this sacrifice
[2:12:02] that you're going to go with me
[2:12:03] according to your word and help me deal
[2:12:06] with this situation sovereignly."
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; I can tell you, I don't even know why
[2:12:10] I'm talking like this, but praise the
[2:12:12] Lord. When the anointing comes, we're
[2:12:14] going to go with it.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; It is the truth.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And their sins and iniquities
[2:12:21] will I remember no more. So, how can we
[2:12:24] possibly remember anybody else's sins or
[2:12:26] iniquities?
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Boy, if we've got a friendship and we
[2:12:30] continually bring it up and say, "You
[2:12:32] remember how you hurt me?
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Remember how you hurt me? Remember how
[2:12:35] you hurt me? Remember that thing you
[2:12:36] did? You did. You did. You did." How how
[2:12:38] good is that friendship going to be?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Not a good friendship.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Think about it. If you got a marriage,
[2:12:42] if you continually say, "You did this,
[2:12:44] you did that, you did this, you did
[2:12:46] that."
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; What's that going to be like in the
[2:12:48] marriage?
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Children, my you always do this.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; You always do this.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; What are they going to do? They're
[2:12:57] always going to do it.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "We never are going
[2:13:02] to live above our confession." That's
[2:13:04] right.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; We have an unconditional covenant with
[2:13:07] the Lord and we love his salvation. And
[2:13:09] we love how he taken our sin and
[2:13:11] iniquity and thrown it into the sea of
[2:13:12] his forgetfulness. Let's do the same
[2:13:14] with our brothers and our sisters. But
[2:13:16] let's not do it with the devil. Let's
[2:13:18] take that iniquity and put it right back
[2:13:19] on him. He's the owner of that iniquity.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; We were talking about it this weekend. I
[2:13:24] think it's beautiful. Well, there's
[2:13:25] coming a day, brothers and sisters,
[2:13:26] where we're going to walk by and we're
[2:13:28] going to see that one on the side of the
[2:13:30] pit and we're going to say, "You're the
[2:13:31] one that brought every single hurt to my
[2:13:34] life.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; You're the one that hurt my children.
[2:13:37] You're the one that hurt my parents.
[2:13:39] You're the one that hurt my brothers and
[2:13:41] my sisters. You're the one that caused
[2:13:43] all of the afflictions in this world."
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to look on them narrowly.
[2:13:48] We're going to squint our eyes and say,
[2:13:50] "You, you're the one.
[2:13:54] Let's put it back on him, brothers and
[2:13:56] sisters. He's the owner of it.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; He's the owner of it, not us.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Don't own it.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; And I will say this, as long as we're
[2:14:06] willing to hold something against
[2:14:08] someone, I have no notes about holding
[2:14:09] stuff against people. Praise the Lord. I
[2:14:11] love this this leadership of the Lord.
[2:14:13] If we're holding something against
[2:14:15] someone,
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; we're holding it against us.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's grounding us.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; We can say it's against them, but what
[2:14:26] it's doing is hindering us.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken used to preach it that way.
[2:14:30] It's just like taking poison and
[2:14:32] drinking it
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; and waiting for it to take effect in the
[2:14:35] other person's life.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; And what's going to happen is we're
[2:14:38] going to see cancer.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; We're going to see all kinds of diseases
[2:14:41] that will happen in our lives when we're
[2:14:43] carrying bitterness and aggression and
[2:14:46] anger.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; We need to let all those things go,
[2:14:48] brothers and sisters,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; and just forgive.
[2:14:53] That's right.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus, God in flesh, he
[2:14:56] said it, just like we forgive is how
[2:14:58] we'll be forgiven.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; So, if we're continually keeping a
[2:15:02] laundry list of things, you know,
[2:15:03] mentally, I know that this happened on
[2:15:05] this date and it hurt me so bad and that
[2:15:07] thing happened and the other thing
[2:15:08] happened and and I just can't let go of
[2:15:10] it. I can't forget about it. You know
[2:15:12] what? You can't on your own. I agree.
[2:15:15] But if you're willing to actually take
[2:15:17] God at his word,
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; if you're willing to take God at his
[2:15:22] word
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; and give it to God to deal with, he'll
[2:15:25] change you.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; We will become a new creature in Christ
[2:15:28] Jesus. In fact, you have to become a new
[2:15:32] creature in Christ Jesus. There's no
[2:15:34] option. It's not an option. Brother
[2:15:36] Bradom said it. Without the Holy Ghost,
[2:15:38] we're lost.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; In the message, the token.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we're lost.
[2:15:43] exact quote.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; This is the covenant. Verse 16 of
[2:15:48] Hebrews 10. This is the covenant that I
[2:15:50] will make with them after those days,
[2:15:52] sayaeth the Lord. I will put my laws
[2:15:54] into their hearts, and in their minds
[2:15:56] will I write them, and their sins and
[2:15:59] iniquities will I remember no more.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; And I I know Brother Barry just keeps
[2:16:04] saying it. Isn't it wonderful to hear?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; He's talking about me right there.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; I say, glory to God. I'm so thankful to
[2:16:12] read this. How encouraging is it?
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "Now where remission of
[2:16:18] these is, there is no more offering for
[2:16:20] sin."
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; We can kind of change our nature.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; And we can change our ways
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; to match his nature and his ways because
[2:16:34] he doesn't change his nature, nor does
[2:16:36] he change his ways. Verse 19, having
[2:16:39] therefore, brethren, boldness. When we
[2:16:42] recognize this, this is what happens.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; When there's no condemnation in our
[2:16:45] lives, we're already seated in heavenly
[2:16:47] places. Romans chapter 8, right? There
[2:16:49] is therefore now no condemnation. Some
[2:16:52] folks want to live in Romans 7. Oh, this
[2:16:54] terrible man that I am, I continually
[2:16:56] have this problem and never seem to be
[2:16:58] able to get over it or progress.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Turn the page.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Turn the page. Those people who walk not
[2:17:05] after the flesh,
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; they're not looking at the outward
[2:17:08] appearance of man, but they're looking
[2:17:10] at the inward
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; workings of the heart.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 19, having therefore, brethren,
[2:17:16] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[2:17:19] the blood of Jesus. We've preached it
[2:17:21] many times that once upon a time it was
[2:17:23] actually death to the individual to go
[2:17:26] beyond that veil into the holy of holies
[2:17:29] in the temple. Now, after Jesus died at
[2:17:32] Calvary, his first order of business was
[2:17:35] to go and rip that veil and say, "Now to
[2:17:38] stay out is death."
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; By a new and living way, which he hath
[2:17:46] consecrated for us through the veil,
[2:17:49] that is to say, his flesh,
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; and having an high priest over the house
[2:17:55] of God. Verse 22, brothers and sisters,
[2:17:59] kind of where I want to get to today.
[2:18:00] And then we're going to bring up a
[2:18:01] quote. Let us draw near with a true
[2:18:04] heart.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; One that he has written his laws in.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; One that he has actually done surgery
[2:18:12] on. We talked about it early on in the
[2:18:13] ministry. We need open heart surgery. We
[2:18:16] need the Lord to come by our way and
[2:18:18] change our hearts. Take out that stony,
[2:18:20] miserable, unforgiving, sinful heart,
[2:18:23] and put in a heart of flesh, something
[2:18:26] that's full of love and forgiveness.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; When that happens, let us draw near with
[2:18:30] a true heart in full assurance of faith,
[2:18:34] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[2:18:36] conscience, and our bodies washed with
[2:18:38] pure water. Let us hold fast the
[2:18:41] profession of our faith without
[2:18:42] wavering,
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; for he is faithful that promised.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; And let us consider one another to
[2:18:51] provoke unto love and to good works.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister didn't mean
[2:18:57] that. Maybe they said that, but I just
[2:19:00] don't think they meant it that way. I
[2:19:02] just don't believe it because I can't
[2:19:04] see the real them,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:19:09] goes on to say, "Not forsaking the
[2:19:10] assembling of ourselves together
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is." Let's not
[2:19:14] just stop there and say we have good
[2:19:16] works because we go to church, brothers
[2:19:17] and sisters. Let's read the whole verse
[2:19:18] here
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is, but exhorting
[2:19:22] one another
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; and so much more as ye see the day
[2:19:27] approaching.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Let's remember to exhort one another
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; as we see the day approaching. Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; I just want to follow up with this now
[2:19:36] with a little quote here that brother
[2:19:38] Brandham talks about and uh it's it's a
[2:19:43] beautiful quote as all of them are and
[2:19:46] uh it's out of the token in 1963.
[2:19:52] The token in 1963 just sort of kind of
[2:19:55] along the lines of what we're talking
[2:19:56] about here. What brother Bradam says,
[2:19:59] he talks about this covenant
[2:20:02] and he says, "Why isn't it called
[2:20:05] eternal covenant?"
[2:20:08] Because that it wouldn't be eternal.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; When we're redeemed, it's all over then.
[2:20:14] It's an everlasting, which means a
[2:20:17] certain amount of time till time is out.
[2:20:20] And we know, brother Bam talks about
[2:20:21] this in the seals about how there's
[2:20:24] everlasting fire. There's going to be a
[2:20:27] time where there will be a punishment,
[2:20:29] but it's not going to be eternal.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Because eternal is God's life. That's
[2:20:35] the only eternal that there is.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; He says it's everlasting, which means
[2:20:39] certain amount of time. Till time is
[2:20:41] out. There'll never be another one. When
[2:20:44] time runs out, we won't need no
[2:20:46] covenant.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; But until time runs out, we need the
[2:20:51] covenant. Amen.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; We need the covenant, brothers and
[2:20:55] sisters. Now, remember Hebrews 13:10-20,
[2:20:59] an everlasting covenant, God's
[2:21:01] bloodbound promise makes us free from
[2:21:04] sin. Amen. There is no sin in him. Sin
[2:21:08] self flesh.
[2:21:11] Worship him and show forth his promised
[2:21:14] power. God's bloodbound
[2:21:18] token power. covenant people has the
[2:21:21] spirit of Jesus Christ hear that he that
[2:21:25] believeth on me the works that I do
[2:21:28] shall he do also
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; I I just think this is beautiful
[2:21:33] brothers and sisters displaying the
[2:21:35] covenant see this is what brother
[2:21:37] Brandham says displaying the covenant so
[2:21:39] what is displaying of the covenant I
[2:21:41] want to say it this way it's not going
[2:21:43] to be in prayer lines and great healings
[2:21:46] and great surprises according to
[2:21:48] miraculous
[2:21:49] things that take place according to the
[2:21:51] word of God which is according to his
[2:21:53] word. There's many different things that
[2:21:55] can happen. But it's not about that. I
[2:21:58] believe it goes a little bit deeper here
[2:21:59] because remember we're we're talking
[2:22:01] from the message the token. Now I'm not
[2:22:03] going to say the prophet was saying
[2:22:04] this. This is what the prophet meant.
[2:22:06] I'm not saying that. What I am saying is
[2:22:08] that the whole entire message goes a
[2:22:10] little bit deeper. The message of the
[2:22:12] hour, the idea that what we're talking
[2:22:15] about is displaying the covenant,
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; living the life.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Day to day, action to action, moment to
[2:22:23] moment. Not just when we come to church.
[2:22:25] Not just when somebody says, "Oh, you
[2:22:27] you're a Christian. You you you act
[2:22:28] differently." What is it about you? It's
[2:22:30] not about that at all. It's about the
[2:22:32] quietest moments of our life. Who are
[2:22:33] we? Where are we at?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; It's displaying the covenant. See,
[2:22:40] brother Bradam says here the new
[2:22:41] testament testament means covenant.
[2:22:43] That's right, isn't it Dr. Vale?
[2:22:45] Testament means covenant. The new
[2:22:46] testament means the new covenant. The
[2:22:49] old testament was the old under the lamb
[2:22:51] and the life could not come back on the
[2:22:54] believer. Remember the people would
[2:22:56] bring their sacrifice according to the
[2:22:58] word of God, observe it seven days, make
[2:23:01] sure that it was free of any blemish,
[2:23:02] and they would have a perfect sacrifice,
[2:23:04] bring it in exactly according to the
[2:23:06] word of God, and have it sacrificed, be
[2:23:09] identified with that blood. They would
[2:23:10] go in as a sinner, and they would leave
[2:23:13] with the exact same desires that they
[2:23:15] had going in. Nothing would change in
[2:23:18] their lives. But as long as they
[2:23:19] followed the word of God for their day,
[2:23:21] they had redemption.
[2:23:24] The New Testament means new covenant.
[2:23:26] The Old Testament was the old under the
[2:23:28] lamb that the life could not come back
[2:23:30] on the believer. The New Testament was
[2:23:32] the lamb of God. And his life comes back
[2:23:36] on us.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, brothers and
[2:23:40] sisters, his life doesn't just come back
[2:23:43] on us and then bounce off.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; And we can look back and say, 40 years
[2:23:47] ago, his life came upon me and now I'm
[2:23:50] good and I can do whatever I want. No,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; no, no, no. His life comes upon us and
[2:23:55] stays on us if it's truly his life.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; His life comes back on us. Blood's life.
[2:24:03] See, blood is the life in the new
[2:24:05] testament. See, life is from the blood
[2:24:07] of the lamb, which means the new
[2:24:09] testament, new covenant, that God after
[2:24:12] those days will I write my laws upon the
[2:24:15] fleshy tables of their heart. See, not
[2:24:17] upon the stony tables and a lamb's blood
[2:24:20] which you had to say, "Yeah, I got the
[2:24:23] blood over here." But what does it say
[2:24:25] do? But upon the tables of your heart.
[2:24:28] See, the spirit covenant. I just think
[2:24:31] how many different covenants he uses
[2:24:33] here in the descriptive terms. The
[2:24:36] spirit covenant will I make with the
[2:24:38] people
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; and it displays his power.
[2:24:43] Now remember, let's not try and get all
[2:24:46] of the fanatics. We're not worrying
[2:24:48] about seeing mighty signs and wonders.
[2:24:51] Let's worry about seeing a new creature
[2:24:53] in Christ Jesus because that is the
[2:24:55] identification of the new covenant,
[2:24:57] brothers and sisters. Seeing the mighty
[2:25:00] works of God is one thing, but you know
[2:25:02] what? The devil can impersonate any
[2:25:04] gift. I'm sorry we're a little bit after
[2:25:06] 12, but I just I feel so impressed to
[2:25:08] continue on. We just have a few more
[2:25:10] paragraphs and then we'll wrap up. I'll
[2:25:12] even call the musicians in earnest to
[2:25:14] prove that I'm going to quit. But you
[2:25:16] know, brothers and sisters, the spirit
[2:25:18] covenant will I make with the people.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; And it displays his power. John 14:12
[2:25:23] says, "He that believeth on me, the
[2:25:25] works that I do shall he do also." Amen.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; If we get this guy right,
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; if we get this guy right, brothers and
[2:25:35] sisters, if we recognize there is
[2:25:37] therefore right now no more
[2:25:38] condemnation, that way I can't hold any
[2:25:41] condemnation against any brother and
[2:25:43] sister because I want to have no
[2:25:44] condemnation in my life. If we're
[2:25:46] willing to hold on to condemnation in
[2:25:48] our life, then we have condemnation.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; The way that we judge others is the way
[2:25:54] that he's going to judge us. If we're
[2:25:56] going to have a laundry list against our
[2:25:58] spouse, he's going to have a laundry
[2:26:00] list against his spouse.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; That's his word.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[2:26:05] his word will remain.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to stand before him having
[2:26:10] a laundry list against my wife.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; No way.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; I want to stand before him knowing that
[2:26:17] I'm behind the blood, that bumper of
[2:26:19] blood.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; The New Testament is new covenant, new
[2:26:23] life.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. shows Jesus has met every
[2:26:27] requirement for us that God required.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus met all the requirements.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we need to do
[2:26:38] except for accept it. We just need to
[2:26:40] believe it the way that he's done it.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:45] He's met every requirement for us that
[2:26:47] God required to make us back truly
[2:26:51] sons and daughters of God under the
[2:26:53] blood where there is no more
[2:26:56] condemnation.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Romans 8:1. There is therefore
[2:27:00] now no condemnation
[2:27:03] to them that are in.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Not those who are believing it. I I
[2:27:10] actually have this in bold in my notes
[2:27:13] here. Maybe stand with me as we close.
[2:27:15] Brother Brandham talking here. He says,
[2:27:17] "Not those who are believing it."
[2:27:23] Which is shocking to me. Do you
[2:27:26] understand what I'm saying? His his
[2:27:28] theme song was only believe. And here we
[2:27:30] have him saying now, "There is therefore
[2:27:33] now no condemnation to them that are in,
[2:27:36] not those who are believing it, those
[2:27:39] who are in Christ Jesus.
[2:27:43] that walk not after the flesh but after
[2:27:45] the spirit. And my word is spirit and
[2:27:47] life. See? Oh, I couldn't couldn't I
[2:27:50] take a text from that and stayed a
[2:27:53] couple more hours, but we'll hurry over
[2:27:55] it. You see, no more condemnation. Free
[2:27:57] from sin, free from cares of the world,
[2:28:00] no condemn. Why? To them that have been
[2:28:03] by one spirit baptized into one body.
[2:28:09] That's why, brothers and sisters,
[2:28:10] outside of his spirit, we're going to
[2:28:11] have condemnation. We're still going to
[2:28:13] be living under the law. We're still
[2:28:15] going to be looking at things carnally.
[2:28:17] We're going to be looking at the flesh.
[2:28:19] We're going to be judging things
[2:28:20] according to the way we think we should
[2:28:21] be doing it and thinking all along that
[2:28:24] the spirit is leading.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Shocking position to be in.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; But when we have his spirit, we're going
[2:28:32] to have forgiveness. I think that's
[2:28:33] going to be one of the greatest
[2:28:34] hallmarks. And that truly, brothers and
[2:28:36] sisters, came out today fresh from the
[2:28:38] throne. Somehow someone here needs
[2:28:40] forgiveness. I know I need forgiveness.
[2:28:42] There's things in my life, people that
[2:28:43] have stepped on my toes that I feel like
[2:28:45] I've I've been hurt by. I need to
[2:28:47] forgive them.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe he's talking to me.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; But no more condemnation. Free from sin.
[2:28:54] Free from the cares of this world. Who
[2:28:56] wouldn't want to live right there? I
[2:28:59] don't have any condemnation in my life.
[2:29:00] I'm already seated in heavenly places.
[2:29:02] I'm free from sin. am free from cares of
[2:29:05] the world.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; To them that have been by one spirit
[2:29:11] baptized into one body.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; One spirit, one body, there ain't going
[2:29:15] to be departments or or zones or
[2:29:18] districts in heaven. And I'll say this
[2:29:21] too, brothers and sisters, to the glory
[2:29:23] of God, there ain't going to be race in
[2:29:25] heaven.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; There's sons and daughters of God. If
[2:29:28] there was race in heaven, then it would
[2:29:30] be documented in his word. Yes.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; If we're busy with all that business
[2:29:36] here on earth, then there's something
[2:29:37] wrong with our heart.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; There ain't no culture in the Holy
[2:29:40] Ghost, someone who is saved in Africa is
[2:29:43] going to act exactly the same as someone
[2:29:45] who is saved in North America who is
[2:29:47] going to act exactly the same as someone
[2:29:49] that's in Australia or in China or
[2:29:52] anywhere we go.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Because it's one body and one spirit.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To them that have been by
[2:30:01] one spirit baptized into one body. There
[2:30:04] the blood of the lamb has been applied.
[2:30:07] The God of heaven has accepted you.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; And your I love how he says this. I'm
[2:30:13] bold again. His life is in you.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; And you are sons and daughters of God.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; I got some more bold here.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Your character
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; is what? It's God's character.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; So, when we see some other character
[2:30:35] slipping in, brothers and sisters, we
[2:30:37] can tell right away that it ain't God's
[2:30:38] character.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; It's just the devil trying to hand us
[2:30:43] iniquity. Just don't take it.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Your character is God's character. What
[2:30:49] is it? A little pushover?
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; No, sir. God is a God of judgment. He is
[2:30:54] a God of correct. It must be on the
[2:30:57] line. nothing else will do. That's the
[2:31:00] kind of character you are because you're
[2:31:02] the character of your father. See
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; you
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; what
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; the life watch when it the life took for
[2:31:14] the blood. See the life itself is took
[2:31:19] see the life it took for the blood. See
[2:31:21] the blood was applied and the life could
[2:31:23] not come back on the believer then for
[2:31:26] the life of the animal. But see, instead
[2:31:28] of a human being, it was a super super
[2:31:31] super human being. See,
[2:31:35] and that makes the human being now not
[2:31:38] only a human being. And I can tell you,
[2:31:40] brothers and sisters, Satan hates
[2:31:42] hearing this because Satan was deceived.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; And he hates that. Those are searing
[2:31:50] words to the devil
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; to be deceived just like he deceived
[2:31:55] Eve.
[2:31:57] Satan himself was deceived
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; because instead of a human being, it was
[2:32:04] a super super super human being. See,
[2:32:06] and that makes the human being now not
[2:32:10] only a human being, but he's a son and
[2:32:13] daughter of God of the super super super
[2:32:20] life that was in him
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; comes back on you. Amen.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just remain somewhere out in
[2:32:28] space in another dimension. It actually
[2:32:30] literally comes back on us.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Super super super super
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; life that comes back
[2:32:46] was in him comes back on you and changes
[2:32:49] you from a sinner and the things of the
[2:32:51] world. And and I love how he says this,
[2:32:54] not just as a sinner out in there in the
[2:32:55] barrooms and and maybe at the stampede
[2:32:58] and doing all that stuff. What does he
[2:33:00] say here? He changes you from a sinner
[2:33:02] and the things of the world and a church
[2:33:04] member,
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; The legalist,
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; and a denominational goer,
[2:33:11] just a message believer. Are you a
[2:33:14] Christian? Have ye received the Holy
[2:33:16] Ghost since ye believe
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; to a born again Christian filled with
[2:33:22] the spirit.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Let's not be message believers. Let
[2:33:27] let's let's be this description right
[2:33:29] here. I'm a bornagain Christian filled
[2:33:31] with the spirit.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; When someone asks us what do we believe?
[2:33:35] That's what I believe.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; I'm a born again Christian that's filled
[2:33:39] with the spirit of the living God.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. the life of God just flowing from
[2:33:45] you like little sparks from an anvil.
[2:33:48] Anybody ever hit an anvil?
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; You hit an anvil, some red hot metal,
[2:33:52] you get sparks
[2:33:54] as you walk full of virtue and love and
[2:33:58] gentleness. And as the Holy Spirit
[2:34:00] moving, speaking, oh my, there you are.
[2:34:02] And with what?
[2:34:05] Hearing the message, watching the pillar
[2:34:06] of fire and the blessed assurance, I've
[2:34:08] passed from death unto life. Note
[2:34:11] therefore no condemnation at all.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not,
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; then we have our petition.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; But when we've got that little tiny
[2:34:24] thing that that inspector has told us
[2:34:27] over and over and over again at the
[2:34:29] bottom of the box car and every year
[2:34:31] that goes by, we just get more stuff
[2:34:33] piled on top of. It's just going to be a
[2:34:35] bigger mess to take it all apart on the
[2:34:37] side of the railroad tracks when it's
[2:34:38] time for that train to go.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; That's true. If we would just take him
[2:34:41] at his word. I say, "Lord, help me. I'm
[2:34:43] not just preaching to you. I'm This is
[2:34:45] the Lord preaching to me."
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not, then we
[2:34:49] have our petition. See, we know. But if
[2:34:51] sin is in our heart, then it condemns
[2:34:54] us. We just might as well not even
[2:34:56] start. See, you've got to get free from
[2:34:59] sin. And the only way you can get free
[2:35:01] from sin is to get in him.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; That's the only covering there is for
[2:35:06] sin.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Christ. Amen. And that truly is the
[2:35:11] baptism of the Holy Spirit, brothers and
[2:35:13] sisters.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; He is more than able.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning?
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so
[2:35:23] thankful for your covenant, Lord. Oh,
[2:35:26] Lord Jesus, to know that you have given
[2:35:28] it to us unconditionally.
[2:35:30] Father, we don't have to try and do
[2:35:32] anything. We just need to accept it the
[2:35:34] way that you've given it, Lord. And it
[2:35:36] causes us to become a new creature. And
[2:35:38] Lord, as you show us things in our life
[2:35:40] that you want to see changed, the
[2:35:41] forgiveness that you want to see
[2:35:43] offered, Lord, oh Father, help us to
[2:35:46] have the courage, Lord Jesus, to do what
[2:35:48] we've maybe never done before and to
[2:35:50] step out by faith and trust that you're
[2:35:53] leading us, Lord.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to
[2:35:57] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[2:35:58] the covenant. Thank you for the
[2:36:00] encouragement, Lord, that we know that
[2:36:02] we can have this no condemnation
[2:36:04] position in our lives. that we could be
[2:36:06] free from all of the effects of this
[2:36:09] world.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, as we walk to walk
[2:36:12] in our lives full of virtue and love.
[2:36:15] Lord Jesus, like the sparks flying from
[2:36:17] an anvil, as we step, oh Lord Jesus,
[2:36:20] more sparks of life from that pillar of
[2:36:22] fire to the people around us, Lord, help
[2:36:24] us literally, Father, in a spiritual
[2:36:27] sense, set spiritual fires with those
[2:36:29] sparks, Lord, in the hearts of other
[2:36:31] people in this world. Father, we don't
[2:36:34] know how many days we have left.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, through your
[2:36:38] testimony of life living out through us.
[2:36:40] Find that last predestinated seed, Lord,
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; that we could fulfill our commission
[2:36:45] here on earth. Lord Jesus, we love you
[2:36:48] and we thank you. We pray that you would
[2:36:50] be with those who are traveling, Lord,
[2:36:51] the Odonovos. Just just bless them
[2:36:54] abundantly, Father. Brother Toby and his
[2:36:56] family and brother Farah and his family.
[2:36:59] Keep your hand upon them, Lord. Bring
[2:37:00] them back safely at the appointed time.
[2:37:03] Father, we pray, Lord, that you would be
[2:37:04] with anyone else who is traveling.
[2:37:07] Father, we're just so thankful for your
[2:37:09] goodness and your tender mercy to us. We
[2:37:11] just ask that you would be glorified now
[2:37:14] in a couple songs before we part ways,
[2:37:16] Lord, as we worship you. We just ask,
[2:37:19] Lord, also that you would give our our
[2:37:21] friends and our our families, Lord, our
[2:37:23] brothers and sisters who will be
[2:37:25] traveling after the service traveling
[2:37:27] mercies, Lord.
[2:37:28] keep your hand upon them, Lord, as we go
[2:37:31] our separate ways. We just ask all these
[2:37:33] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:37:36] pray.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:39] Is that grace? Grace,
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; marvelous
[2:37:45] grace of our loving
[2:37:50] Lord.
[2:37:52] Grace that exceeds
[2:37:56] our sin and our guilty

[2:39:07] in the soul
[2:39:10] within

[2:40:10] Dark
[2:40:11] is the state that we cannot
[2:40:17] hide.
[2:40:19] What can I fail to wash it away?
[2:40:27] [Music]
[2:40:30] There is flowing

[2:45:42] to live all my life
[2:45:46] through
[2:45:48] your
[2:45:50] eyes.
[2:45:53] I've captured
