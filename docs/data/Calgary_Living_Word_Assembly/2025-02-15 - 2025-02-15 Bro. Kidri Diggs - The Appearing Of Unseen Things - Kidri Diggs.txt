Glory but you be the one that gets the glory and the honor for you are great Lord Lord we thank you and we sing praises to your name in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray that church say Amen amen amen somebody say Amen again amen amen if you have your Bibles let's um turn to Second Kings chapter 6 second Kings chapter 6 let's start reading that um verse 15 well let's back up to 13 we know this is the king summoning Elisha he's sending you know if we want to say troops down to get Elijah in the middle of the night when he wasn't you know paying attention to anything you know verse 13 says and he said go and spy where he is that I may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Doan this is 2 Kings chapter 6 ver14 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord Open the Eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountains was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 praise the Lord amen verse one the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen may the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God tonight I want to use for a subject the appearing of unseen things the appearing of unseen things amen you know it may it may sound like a a strange topic but we know we know the prophet preached a message called looking into the Unseen and as Believers Church um The Seed of Abraham was pushed to live this kind of life because God told Abraham you know he said go and walk before me and be thou perfect you know and Abraham he he per se the only Direction he had was the voice of God you know he didn't know where he was going he didn't know the battles he was going to come up against so he he literally had to live a life of Faith amen and when you're living a life of Faith you're really living in the Unseen realm amen but what I want to say tonight is the Unseen things are even more real than the things that are seen amen and they're even more powerful than the things that per say our five senses can be make tangible that's right but the Unseen things are so great and so powerful they are unexplainable Hallelujah somebody say amen amen now what what I'm saying is what I'm saying tonight is I'm speaking from a spiritual journey that you me all of us our journey walking in the Unseen Rim by faith makes the things of God appear amen hallelujah because it's a walk of faith and faith has to be an assurance Faith Can't Be A hope so or maybe but it has to be I know God got my back right I know God is real I know God Is A Healer you know to claim your faith you bring that healing out of the Unseen realm that is already here that's right God is Not performing The Healing he's already done it it's you and I accepting the healing Hallelujah so it's making the Unseen things appear to be even more real amen hallelujah hallelujah but as I preach tonight I want you to catch something the Unseen things are already here amen yes sir amen hallelujah amen amen but what has to happen spiritually just like naturally it takes an instrument so we can see it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen you know as we look right here in the Bible where Elisha everybody all right tonight where Elisha you know I feel my helper Hallelujah if you don't know what that mean that mean I feel the presence of the Lord amen hallelujah thank you Lord you know as we look right here in the story with Elisha you know the king he said go fetch him I want I want I need to talk to him but what he did was he wanted to be not seen yeah yeah so what he did was he snuck up on the prophet at night Hallelujah and he came with horses and chariots and he thought that because I'm not seeing Hallelujah I got to jump on this man but then the servant the servant of elishah woke up and he looked outside and he saw that the mountains or and so forth they were they were surrounded Hallelujah with with horses and chariots and fear came about now there are things that are that are compassion life or or surround you and sometimes it brings fear but that's not what it's there for it's there so that you can see the realness of God come tangible in your life not for us to be afraid but God allows us to go into things or things happen just so we can see how real he is hallelujah and In This Moment the other the only other the purpose for them to be surrounded was to show that God can surround our enemy Hallelujah even when they couldn't even see it they were surrounded yes sir oh my but the man of God the servant of God he said oh my Elisha look we're surrounded now I want you to catch this this man Hallelujah had already seen a Vindicated Prophet that's right right yes if we go to chapter five chapter five is the story of non and non was a great man a great warrior a great Soldier and he was he was a general he was honorable among everybody but he was a leper right but then there was somebody who knew of a god Hall that could heal lepr Hallelujah W she knew something that nobody else knew she could see something about name's condition that nobody else could see she could see that the condition of leprosy would bring a God that's a Healer on the scene amen so what she did was she went to H uh the the the uh the woman she was serving as a hands made and say hey I know a God in Israel and I know that there's a prophet down there Hallelujah that can call on his God Amen and make the Unseen things Hallelujah become visible hallelujah amen all it took was a acceptance from nonon but nonon because he was already feeling so great and so proud when he went down he had a way in his mind he think that God ought to become visible yeah so what Hallelujah Elisha he came down to see Elisha and elijas didn't even come out to see him right that's it that's right but he sent a word yes amen glory I want you to understand if all God sends you is a word God is in that [Applause] word hallelujah you don't have to see a visible God all you have to do is take him for his word oh that's right because we're dealing with faith and faith is the assurance that God exist amen that's right amen right are you with me church and now Church neon comes down and he's saying all this and that and Elijah says hey just go dip in Jordan seven times Hallelujah see he's looking at it from a natural real yes and he's thinking Jordan's dirty Jordan's nasty but Elijah is looking at it saying the promise and Vindication of God is in that River if you just take my word for it you'll be made whole but he was looking at the circumstances too often we look at the circumstances and the circum ances in the natural May overshadow what God is don't look at it with your natural eye we're looking at the Unseen things where does it come from it comes from the Seed of Abraham thank you Lord oh my and church what looked like it was nothing God was in it amen hallelujah and sometimes things are so simple yes because it's so simple we miss it even but Paul I'm going Jump Ahead a little bit even right now everything you need is here but you may think that's right why ain't nobody jumping why ain't nobody shouting that doesn't mean it's not here hallelujah Faith Hallelujah doesn't solely rely on your emotions right amen now don't get me wrong I'm not here to criticize or like we say in my culture dis Hall diss emotions Hallelujah because if I feel like shouting I'm going to shout if I feel like dancing I'm going to dance hall and I may be shouting and dancing and you may be wondering Hallelujah why am I doing it you can't see what I see it's my own personal experience so you may be looking at me you may be thinking that's not necessary you don't know what I'm going through and you don't know the deliverances that God has brought in my life so if you see someone dancing and shouting don't criticize it ask God to open your eyes not your lit your eyes but your understanding am Hallelujah you know we do that too often we'll see something going on and we're like why is he doing that why is she doing that it may not be for you to understand oh does that sit well with you one thing I realize in church you know a lot of times we have too many chiefs and not enough Indians right well everybody knows what our next step or next move should be when God already has an order amen the easiest thing Hallelujah but we make it the hardest thing is to follow amen did you know following is the easiest thing what stops us from following the way we understand or what we can see Hallelujah I tell you right now say hey I want to drive from here back to the Carolinas and right there every piece of reasoning you got will give you a reason not to follow me man that drive going to be three days and you go on and on and on and won't even know if it'll be a supernatural event we could get outside of Canada and get translated but you miss that because you're leaning on what you can see and how you understand with God expect the impossible with God hallelujah he can do things that our own human reasoning can't understand so we ought to be willing to go where God leads and I'm not saying follow me back to South Carolina but that's just an illustration yeah yeah but we look church at the servant I want you to catch the scene of the servant the servant now he looks out the window or maybe opens the door or whatever and now he sees all these horses and chariots and he's like oh my God in his heart of hearts he's thinking we're going to die this is a man who's walked with the supernatural amen he was there naming one two three full dipping seven times in the River Jordan and walking out whole I believe the Bible say his skin came back like the skin of a [Music] baby if you've ever seen God move like that why would you ever a doubt I'll say it like this right now we're in a a space of time where things are becoming more and more challenging but it's happening that way because we're becoming more and more perfect hallelujah what do you think it's all about amen our trials are getting greater amen things are happening more people that we thought were real Believers are stepping away what is happening the perfecting of the Bride is being manifest Hallelujah but the thing we have to be careful about is being in the midst of it and not having an experience with it right because this man the servant he was in the midst of it he was right there with Elisha dealing with non and and probably previous things onto that he was right there he saw God he knew God was real but when it came time for him to believe he was afraid amen and I love how the prophet dealt with him the prophet didn't like you and I rebuke him rebuke him for not believing amen amen call him a a wishy-washy slow to believe believer no he didn't do that and sometimes when people don't see things like we do we get we we jump way out there they might be serpent [Music] seed Elijah see that that's my greatest problem with all the different doctrines we have if you believe your Doctrine is right why separate from me convince me amen right yes convince me don't try to tear up my church just be a l L be a lamb and if it's really of God if it's you Hallelujah if God is using you wait till your turn comes don't try to tear my church don't try to tear me up but if it's real God will convince me but because most of the doctrines are not real it brings chaos right it brings separation it brings hatred it brings envy and jealousy and all these things why because it's not the character of God amen that's right Hallelujah but I believe hallu that's why I could I could I could go witness to atheist Hallelujah cuz I believe what I got is real I have an assurance you tell me you're atheist atheist I'm not you going to hell no I ain't doing that cuz that atheist might be a believer that's right because if I could say it plain Hallelujah every disciple looked like an atheist until they met Jesus W but the only one that was really trying to serve God was Paul everybody else was just a flat rank sinner yes sir Hallelujah everybody else God had to really deal with it Peter love the fight and cuss amen don't turn The Blood Hound loose but but Church what we do too often we judge it before it's time when we are to let things unfold spiritually instead of what our eyes see and this young man he walked with the prophet he was there experiencing the supernatural all these things but when it came his chance to believe he was afraid but that doesn't mean he was not a child of God hallelujah cuz Elijah he says to him he says Lord open his eyes so that he can see who's with us hallelujah amen and look the king he came with horses and chariots but when God opened the eyes of the servant God also had them surrounded with horses and chariots but not just ordinary horses and chariots this was a whole another level of what God was horses and Chariots of Fire woo [Applause] Bo yall Make Me Dance up in here hallelujah church when God come to take care of the enemy he really takes care of the enemy I love how the Bible says hallelujah when Jesus came he held captivity captive Hallelujah y'all know we don't believe this but God was controlling Co God's controlling the flu God's controlling HIV cancer whatever it is he held captivity captive how do you say that who created the devil right am God God created the devil yes and the devil cannot do anything but what God allows but we look and we see now God opens eyes and now he's standing there and he's the Unseen things have become visible because he was in the right place amen hallelujah he was walking with the right truth and that's the Assurance I want to bring tonight I ain't going to be long y'all know I'm about to close that's the Assurance I want to bring tonight Hallelujah if you are following truth amen if you are following a true message and messenger Vindication will always be there I'm not talking about the Vindication of William Bram I'm talking about your Vindication Hallelujah I'm talking about God vindicating to you that you are on the right path Hallelujah that's why God came down and Open the Eyes of the servant he could have just left it with the eyes of the Prophet being open but he wanted those him who was following that Prophet to know that God is with him [Music] also Hallelujah that's why I don't look at the message as William Brandon's [Music] message it's just as much mine as it is his Hallelujah and if it was not for us he would have never came Hallelujah but the Unseen Things become invisible Church even right now I believe I said the last time I was here even right now in the fourth dimension there are supernatural beings in this room amen hallelujah see I feel a spiritual connection with you but it's not a per se instrument we can see it's an attraction Spirit to Spirit word to word amen something that you can't see with the natural eye but it becomes visible as we smile amen hallelujah it's in an unseen real in an unseen real ministering spirits of joy is in this room hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Ministry experience of peace is in this room you say brother what are you talking about you could you could be thinking about something or worried about something and a word comes and speak to you directly and it gives you what a peace of mind you can't buy that that's in an unseen real you can't purchase that you believe for that amen amen amen thank youen right now I want somebody to go to Costco and buy me 30 lbs of Love Can anybody do can't do it buy me a 30 lb bag of Love Can't Do It Love Is An unseen manifestation of God appearing real in the believer's Life Hallelujah you say you say you say you say to Leisa say Leisa I love you she say prove it to me you don't pull your wallet out say here it go right here no you show her with your actions you show her with your life and as she See your action it becomes more and more real to her and what does that do that gives her rest W so when the other thing Seeing Things become visible it produces a rest in your [Music] life oh Hallelujah I don't see why people don't want to serve God Amen somebody go to the store and buy me a loaf of Peace can't do it but peace I'm about to say something peace is priceless anybody got peace you can't put a price tag on that can you it's Priceless Hallelujah you wouldn't trade anything for your peace your peace is one thing that helps you to exist it's Priceless and then we call the one we serve the Prince of Peace Hallelujah so with him amen the peace that we have is on a whole another level of just having a good job amen if you got him the job that you need is already present you just have to accept it oh my but church as we think about faith and amen you know the appearing of unseen things a lot of times our walk is to make visible the things that are in our path that's going to bless somebody else amen amen God told Abraham he said hey go walk before me and be thou perfect and Abraham started walking first battle I'm your brother not your husband I'm your brother not your husband were they acting like brother and sister or husband and wife husband and wife see fear get you to live in a real that's lie amen amen oh my my but that didn't change the promise Hallelujah your mistakes my now we need this as a body of Christ if you are bride if you are a genuine seed of God nobody in here mistakes will ever stop them from making it amen boy you say brother that's a strong statement if you are a seed of God hallelujah what's going to stop God from becoming God H nothing right well I'll say it like this if we have a snowstorm tomorrow Hallelujah and it and it wipes wipes all the branches off the trees is that going to stop that tree from producing when it's time come no it's going to must up everything it has inside when the season comes to push out because it's used to pushing out the storm doesn't change who you are but what it really is a greater witness of what's already inside of you hallelujah hallelujah so the so the storm Hallelujah is to show the Unseen thing in you manifest glory to God hallelujah Church when we look at you know the Unseen rim and the rim of faith and Walking with God God would allow that now now now before I go any further I'm G to make a statement really I can close on the statement God was a redeemer before the foundation of the world [Music] that's right and every other attribute of him he was that before the foundation of the world Hallelujah so you think about what you need he's already provided that's right amen amen amen the easiest but the hardest thing for us to do is to say Lord I accept anybody pay their tithes you're already blessed thank you cuz that's a promise hallelujah we're not looking at the bank account we're looking at the promise of the word and if I ain't got it God will make sure it get to me why because he cannot deny his word thank you Lord amen but if you're living in a natural real Hallelujah you'll find yourself stagnant yes by what you see amen what you taste feel smell or hear amen these senses are here to keep you Earthbound right but I want to live in a whole another real yes sir hallelujah amen but when we think about God being God before the foundation of the world before anything else was ever done or created on Earth he was that amen W Hallelujah Glory he was that now I'm speaking to your need he is that hallelujah hallelujah before the Earth was created before you was created he is what you need already but what happens he allows certain situations to happen so what's in you can come out and become visible right hallelujah amen see uh me and brother Jeff we were talking I am right Jeff right we were talking at the the breakfast that morning and and he was asking me was I you know per se born in the message I like no I said well my mom came into the message and we started to see a change in her life when she used to pull that Lev off and turn into zaro some of you young people don't know nothing about zaro that man was dangerous with a whip Hallelujah and he put a z on you when he finish with you zaro that's us to call my mama cuz her name was Zora so her name was with Z but she was dangerous with a leather belt but when she came into this truth we start to see things that were taking place inside of her come out naturally Grace taken over in certain situation more compassion Hallelujah more understanding Hallelujah all these things start to take place with the acceptance of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the Unseen things becoming real to her children yeah and I was telling brother Jeff that she didn't play she had rules uh she had uh uh stoplight rules not stoplight but you know the the light the light that be on the post at night like by the house street lights yeah that's it street light she was a street light parent cuz she was like if this light catch you before you get home you in trouble cuz that light sister Judy that light normally comes on when it's dark Hallelujah and she used to tell us sister CL said you be in this house before it get dog so when it start Andrew when it start turning dust dog we like man I got to go they didn't know what was going on but we were moving in the Unseen real because if you didn't it was going to be a judgment and nobody else was going to feel your pain but you so she was like hey y'all be home this is a rule y'all be home before it get dark we go shoot ball we ride bikes we do all stuff you young people don't do now we go play balls whatever ride bikes do all that stuff in the neighborhood and she said hey be back in this house before them lights come on Dust dark so when it start the sun start going down you be like I don't care who winning you be like Deuces I'm out of here call me soft call me scared cat call me whatever but you won't call me getting the whipping Hallelujah so you know but this one particular day amen this was after she had then you know got born again and received Christ this one particular day we was about 20 minutes away from the house maybe 20 25 minutes walk because back in those days as young people we didn't mind walking y we didn't mind getting on our bike and riding through the neighborhood amen Christmas time oh man I got a bik where are those days but anyway I digress but you know we were we were playing ball one day about 25 minutes from the house everybody all right about 25 minutes from the house at the park and you know we was having a good time you know how it is you playing and you especially when you winning amen but you know we you you you playing team against team and because we were brothers me and my brother never played on the same team because we wanted to beat one another right right so anyway my team lose he's three years older than me my team lose and I'm on the sideline but while I'm on the sideline I'm watching the Sun and his team is winning they boy they will tan everybody up that day they were T they were dunking they were doing every they T everybody up you know but as the sun start going down I start easing away from the park my brother still playing but I'm I'm making my way home sometimes if you got to go by yourself you need to go by yourself Hallelujah somebody else might not see or understand what you understand and now it's time mil now it might be a time to walk [Applause] alone even though I walk through the valley of The Shadow of death I will get no [Applause] whipping amen so I made it home right before the sun went down my brother was still playing the sun is gone the moon coming out and I'm thinking boy he going to get tore up tonight I can't wait this going to be a movie you know how we is that siblings we love to see our brother and sister get it y'all might well say am man you know you like that don't talking about oh I we we loved each other yeah you did you did but not whipping time and you know I was like boy he going to get a good one tonight and I'm going to get a front row seat and when it's over with I'mma I'mma get in his face I'm say boy the way you was running oh man but church he got home home and mama was waiting on him and I was waiting too and I'm behind the scenes now because in my house you can't be you can't get caught making fun of somebody in they trouble you might turn around W you might you might get it too so you have to do it kind of sleek so I'm like looking around the corner and and he come in and she's like boy where you been at he's like M I was playing ball she said you know my rules you know when you supposed to be back in the house he said look ma I was on the winning team and we was winning and we was running everybody off the court and how does it look in the middle of the game I'm like y'all I got to go cuz I might get a whipping and we were teenagers then and I was like I was just looking for that what I was looking for no matter what he was going to saying I know he was going to get it and that's what I was waiting on but something that was stirring on the inside of her became manifest what was it Grace and she said to my brother she said well look the next time you're playing you make sure you're watching so you can know when it's time to go and you don't get caught up and break my rules all right have a good night I'm like what I'm like come on give me what I want to see but she gave him Grace and from there I realized that something was going on inside Mama that the natural eye couldn't see and it got greater and greater more understanding came more grace came like she still I'll give it to you now but some when she used to wouldn't talk talk it out she would talk it out you know she wanted to understand where we were coming from parents understand where they coming from before you go upside the head amen oh I'm sorry we don't do [Music] that Hallelujah but Church uh what I'm saying is as you get closer to God more of God comes out of you and nobody even right now nobody can really say who has the Holy Ghost only God can but the Bible says by their fruit amen you know them Hallelujah if you amen come to church uh once a week or twice every month and you off something wrong with that that mean that you have desires or hungers for other things else there's something going on in you in the Unseen real and is become invisible by your actions right amen hallelujah but as we look at we see that faith is the Assurance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen Hallelujah so real Faith amen brings forth real evidence amenah and like I said with Abraham even in his mistakes God was still there to protect his promise now before I close why do we go through trials so that we can be perfected cuz there's something about you there's a picture or molding about you God is trying to show the world so he let Abraham go this way and do some wrong things why because he had to become the father of Faith Hallelujah and he couldn't do that with fear in his life he couldn't do that with a lying spirit in his life so God took him through trial that get rid of the fear God took him through trial that get rid of the lies hallelujah amen so church if you're going through something ask yourself what is God trying to bring out of me yes sir hallelujah look I had cancer in my brain why why did it happen what was it all about God was moving in the Unseen realm because cancer was the only thing that could bring out the Healer hallelujah hallelujah and I would have never known God was a Healer if I hadn't got cancer in my brain so that trial was to bring out the grace of God Amen and there are things in your life my life things that we go through that are not explainable but God is bringing out his attribute he's bringing out who he is any unchanged real yeah but we have to be like Abraham the Bible says he called those things that are not as though they were unseen amen I'm about to close you said brother de what is it what's really going on well I say it like this this is what the prophet of God says if you don't mind me reading this listen he says in God's provision for Divine Healing was on the basis of Faith somebody say amen amen and thus the same way he heals them tonight is the basis of Faith yes amen amen now he's using healing but Faith operates everything else too righten Hallelujah Faith operates Deliverance yes Faith operates love love peace and all the other attributes of God hallelujah when you're looking at the pyramid Hallelujah the statue of a perfect man what does it deal with what's the bottom of it Hallelujah Faith that's right everything builds upon faith faith is the substance amen you can have no brotherly kindness without faith Hallelujah amen right listen he says no matter how great a man if Christ himself was standing here on the pull pit with the suit that he gave me if he was standing here in the suit he could not heal you not at all why he has already done [Applause] it anybody got a need tonight amen hallelujah amen he has already done it [Music] Hallelujah for those of you who were afraid to raise your hand Hallelujah I don't know what you but I got a need yeah he has already provided he's already done it he just want me to accept Lord I Thank you for doing what you do hallelujah amen oh my remember we said a while ago that before the world was ever framed Hallelujah he was already what we're talking about right so whatever you need God has already done it we just have to accept it and play out walk through it you say Brother D what what what well how are we coming into it if God is Not doing it God is no longer working remember that last day what did he do he rested amen God ain't working no more he's just putting you Hallelujah in the path of your blessing and as you reach it you accept it because it's already there amen amen are you catching me amen see we we we struggle so much and I got to fast I got to pray and yes I believe in those things let me tell you something about fasting I'm a steward of fasting most of every time I've been in a serious need I go into fasting and God answers my prayer Hallelujah so when you find the tools that work in your life the prophet of God said if you go back and meet those conditions it'll happen that way every time Hallelujah so I don't try to do anything different I just go back to what God has already blessed hallelujah amen if it's you getting down on your knees and closing the door and putting on some music or whatever you do and God answers your prayer go back to that again because he can't change God has to remain the same the only thing that changes Is Us and how we see God but God remains the if he answers you one way one time he has to answer you that way all the [Applause] time when we think about faith we put our own reasoning in it look church when Jesus was walking out there on the water and Peter saw it first they said it's a spirit yeah it was a holy spirit hallelujah hallelujah but what was God going to do God was going to bring out something unseen that was in Peter he didn't know was there but God had to do it in a in a way that seem impossible now he's walking out of the water and Peter says Lord if that's you bid me to come he didn't say wait till the Revival Services he didn't say go pray seven weeks go fast three days he said come hallelujah amen amen amen I'm going to I'm going to show you the very thing that your believing is tangible Hallelujah now you got to think about it Peter is seeing a man do something he's never seen before but he has faith in God that's the only way he can step out there because he knew that Jesus was real and now he steps out there he said Lord he might have put one foot out there to test it out and that ocean was solid took another step H and another step now one thing you got to be mindful of as long as he was stepping his ey was on Jesus and as long as he was stepping his pathway was solid cuz he was looking at Jesus nothing else could get his attention his eyes was on Jesus I wonder how many of us as we walking this life Journey our eyes are on Jesus you keep your eyes on Jesus and your pathway will remain silent it'll be strong enough to hold you and now he's walking he's walking he get out there to Jesus and he's like oh man then he looks around maybe he a wind comes and hits him knocks him out balance and and all these things then fear sinks in and he starts to sink and he reaches his hand out to Christ Christ grabs him now this is the scene we've left I want to ask you something how did Peter get back back in the boat I don't believe Jesus put him on his shoulder say man you ain't got no faith put him on his shoulders say come on let's get back in the boat the same way you got out here is the same way you going to get back Hallelujah so if you seeking a little bit tonight Reach Out Hallelujah reach out and grab Jesus cuz the same Jesus that call you out there is the same Jesus that'll take you back hallah yes Lord hallelujah he didn't put Peter on his on his shoulders in the midst of his Struggle No he grabbed him by the hand pulled him up ey level and said come on Peter follow me hallelujah what are you saying brother digs Peter always had the ability to walk on water he just needed to meet Jesus right there yes amen great w bring it on you say oh my glory is it real to you church and me reading that made me see one day that I could walk on water hallelujah hallelujah I was at camping Red Deer one time and we was out there you know you know know the water I did at Camp I said you know what it's like I said I'm going to walk on this water by the grace of God I made a step and I made a step the things that I've read about the things that I've heard about now has become intangible by my faith and I'm walking out there I'm out there standing on the lake it was frozen but I did it Hallelujah it was frozen God ain't say how it got to look he just said believe believe in ye shall receive Hallelujah you can say what you want to say hallelujah ice melted is what water amen my testimony is not I walked on Ice no I walked on water and you can't take that from me amen amen don't let somebody steal what you believe about your God hallelujah look let me finish reading don't get nervous I'm almost done where I'm at okay if Christ I said I read it if Christ himself was standing here on the pull pit with the suit you know he's standing here in the suit he he could not heal you not at all he has already already done it now this is what I like and this is where we fall church he said he might do something to convince you or point you to the word and that would be convincing and he might show through some Divine gift that he was Christ but he could not heal you see so what he does he points us to something just to convince us why because he's already done it amen amen hallelujah I'mma close church right now there are supernatural beings I said this in this room Angels Hallelujah yes Angels ministering Spirits spirits of glory and if you're listening to the wrong voice they're also ministering spirits of sadness that's right uh-huh ministering spirits of of defeat all those things are moving right now in this room but church if we would just pay attention if we if we would just pay attention to who we are and what we are the hidden things will become visible amen hallelujah [Music] hallu y'all hear that from the inside that song says let Praises rise from the inside now what I want you to catch your eyes can't see the song but it's moving in this room right now you say it's in my phone no my phone is the instrument my my phone is the instrument but the song is moving right right now I want to hear it again the song is moving right now in this room where is it church it's not in my phone it's on an unseen Network hallelujah hallelujah there's a network moving through this room right now that's playing a song that says let Praises rise but it takes an instrument to pick it up Hallelujah right now in this room Deliverance is moving through here but it'll take an instrument to pick it up Joy is moving through this room but you have to be an instrument to pick it up find the proper Network the network of God's blessings is moving through this room can you pick it up you pick it up by saying Lord I accept Hallelujah am the song is not on my phone but the network is moving all over the world am Hallelujah I can play the same song in Africa that's right right my phone just have to be able to pick up the network amen just how I can preach Jesus Christ the same way in South Carolina that I preach right here in Canada cuz the people can pick him up hallelujah thank you Lord Church in my closing to prove that to prove to you that whatever you need is already here tonight am amen amen amen I ain't got all of you own boy do you believe what you need is here tonight I'm going prove it to you Hallelujah you know there was a season or a time in the world where man got tired of walking and he brother Barry he begin to catch an inspiration he looked at something God created and he said if I could put a saddle on that horse it's faster than me it's stronger than me it can get me where I need to go right the horse was the instrument but the inspiration came from man but what they needed to travel faster was already here it didn't have to be created it didn't have to be created it was already here because God said let there be and it was the horse was already here to meet the need of somebody that needed to go faster and then somebody else got tired of riding a horse and Henry Ford he said you know what the horses all right but I believe we can go a little faster and he started to get a diagram in his mind yeah to do what invent an instrument not create uhuh he didn't create theal mobile he invented it because everything he used to invent the automobile was already on the Earth where did it come from Let There be and it [Applause] was oh Hallelujah the Unseen things appearing amen but then it came to men and say you know what I'm tired of driving I believe I was born to fly yeah W they say I'm tired of Ford I'm tired of Chevy hey I believe I was I can fly but we need an instrument and those Brothers Hallelujah the right Brothers you know them the right Brothers they created no no they didn't create the airplane they invented it all the elements everything that they needed to invent Hallelujah the airplane was already on the earth God gave inspiration to put it together for their [Applause] need you somebody else say I want to go to space I want to go in places that no man has ever gone we're going to create no now this creation this invention was not like any other invention because this invention would take you beyond what the natural man can see amen hallelujah hallelujah this inspiration will take you beyond natural sight but this inspiration would take you into a whole another real a whole another place is called what astronauts Hallelujah they create they invented the rocket Hallelujah they didn't create it they invented it why because they use God's Parts amen right amen and I'm here to say that every part you need is already [Music] [Applause] here you just got to tap in come come musicians I'm closing Hallelujah right on time Hallelujah Church what you need if if I dare to say it like this what you need is moving through this room right now you just have to spiritually be able to accept it Hallelujah agree with it and bring it closer amen how do you bring it closer by just resting in faith amen hallelujah don't make what I'm saying any deeper than what it is it's just like salvation how many of us worked our way into salvation nobody we accept the work of Calvary that's right we accept what he did and by the work of Calvary we are redeemed but let me say it like this we was already redeemed we just had to meet that in a space of time Hallelujah accept it and now we're walking in it Hallelujah sir but so often what we do we say ah Brother D that was for that day that was for this day what I've been doing what I've been saying to myself you know some people say well this ain't the season that ain't the season when I got a need that's the season for it yeah Hallelujah whatever your need is this is the season for it don't put God way off he's a god of now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen now Faith not yesterday's faith not tomorrow's Faith now Faith amen amen hallelujah and church you think about it when we hear stuff like this it should set us on fire amen hallelujah hallelujah amen it should set us on fire amen hallelujah because all of us have been through things we couldn't control that's right all of us have been through things like Lord why is this happening to me because God wants to show you how real [Music] is I I I hope I hope he on mind I remember the trial you were going through H with your business I guarantee you y'all don't look at God the same anymore oh my I guarantee you amen when the doctor said this going to happen that going to happen and now you still here I guarantee you concerning healing and Faith you don't look at God the same thing wasn't even married now you oh my hallu church just think about it the things that God has done hallelujah four four year 4 years ago you couldn't see yourself sitting in a church hallelujah praise the Lord but here you are what is it it's the grace of God what is it it's the Unseen things Jeff what was he a Son of God hallelujah the devil say no I made him leave and all these things but here you are you and your whole family what is it is the Unseen Things become invisible the grace of God the mercy of God coming through a trial and what I like to say and this may be a shocker to you Hallelujah some of us go through things and it look like oh my God y'all be looking at like oh my God he does she that she does and you know we look at and we look at it the wrong way because the very thing that you may think disqualifies me actually qualifies [Music] me oh my oh that didn't go over good cuz some of you want to pin one another down by a quot or by this or by that Hallelujah don't we realize Paul persecuted the church why that was the grace of God right amen God had to let him be a persecutor just to get him on that horse to knock him off that's right oh my disqualified to be qualified and when the prophet preached Masterpiece he said it was the flaw that made it a masterpiece forgive me for my flaws but it's my struggles and it's the things that I can't explain but I'm still believing God that makes me a masterpiece there the things you can't explain but you still believe in God that makes you a masterpiece because it was the flaw Michelangelo looked at it and everything that was in his mind was looking right back in me he said speak to me amen amen hallelujah Hallelujah am amen oh my let's get rid of this called former religion amen yes Lord amen amen hallelujah let's get rid of this I need to see something religion amen yes and let's be what God called us to be amenallah remember that young man walked with the prophet but he didn't have the same experience as the prophet that's right Hallelujah even though God was with him also he couldn't see it and God had to open his eyes I guarantee you from that day he was different cuz he was saying Lord you're not just with you're not just with Elisha you're with me amen look Church Hallelujah Elijah didn't even go look he already knew God was with him Hallelujah so who was that trial for it was for the servant amen oh my hallu let's pray play play uh speak Jesus for me I don't know what key Kia C or something like that I don't know hallelujah amen thank you Hallelujah Hall Lord Jesus father we love you we thank you tonight Hallelujah and Lord even right now the answer to every prayer is in this room the victory that lies before us is in this room Lord and Lord we are Abraham's seed so we believe in those things that are not as though they are and Lord just help your people rise up to that place of Faith where they can just be settled in the promises of God lord and we will let the five senses have more reverence than us believing You by Faith Lord Lord we love you Lord and words cannot express and Lord just bring us out of the humanistic real to walk as children of God yes Lord to know that you are controlling everything you have everything Lord under control because Faith brings everything under control and we know that by faith the worlds were framed yes amen so our very own God used his own faith Hallelujah to speak and believe whatever he was going to say was going to come to pass and Lord we pray you give us that same unction to speak and believe that whatever we say according to the word of God will come to pass Lord we love you and we pray you just continue to bless this church Lord take them
