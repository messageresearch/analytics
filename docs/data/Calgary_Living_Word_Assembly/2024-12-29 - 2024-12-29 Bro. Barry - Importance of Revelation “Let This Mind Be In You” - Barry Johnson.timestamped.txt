[39:43] place is none of those that provided
[39:46] place is in you and we're so thankful

[40:26] single need according to your riches in
[40:30] glory father we pray that Lord Jesus as
[40:33] we endure the trials in our lives father
[40:35] that we would Lord look to you and thank
[40:38] you Father for your goodness in our

[41:01] know you as their healer amen father
[41:05] we're so thankful that you have many
[41:06] attributes that you desire to express
[41:09] and we know there's only one way that
[41:10] you can do that and that's to have
[41:12] subjects to express yourself to and
[41:15] through father this morning we pray that
[41:18] Lord we could just step into another
[41:20] realm father that we could see Heaven
[41:22] and Earth meet once again that Lord when
[41:25] we leave this place today we would say
[41:27] truly that our hearts burned within us
[41:29] because you spoke to us along the way
[41:32] and father when we recognize your voice
[41:34] when we no longer hear Brother Barry
[41:36] speaking that we could say oh Father

[41:41] change my heart let me put myself on
[41:44] that on that potter's wheel and be
[41:46] molded and shaped Lord and not have the
[41:49] starchy attitude that I know it and I've
[41:51] already been shaped and that's as good
[41:53] as it's going to get father help us to

[43:49] start with verse
[43:53] one if there be any therefore if there
[43:57] be therefore any consolation in Christ
[44:01] if any comfort of love if any Fellowship
[44:04] of the
[44:05] spirit if any bowels and

[44:14] joy that ye be
[44:17] likeminded having the same love being of
[44:22] one Accord of one
[44:26] mind I just think that's so good it it
[44:29] just it's so clear isn't it let nothing
[44:32] be done through Strife or vain
[44:36] Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each
[44:40] esteem other better than themselves now
[44:45] that's a tough one even amongst
[44:49] Believers look not every man on his own
[44:52] things but every man also on the things
[44:55] of others
[44:57] and let this mind be in you amen which
[45:01] was also in Christ Jesus let's just bow
[45:05] one more time Heavenly Father we thank
[45:08] you for your word we know that it's
[45:10] Eternal we know that all heavens and all
[45:13] Earth will pass away but your word is
[45:16] the only thing that will remain and
[45:18] father Lord we just ask that your mind
[45:21] would be in us and we know there's only
[45:23] one way for that to happen and that's by
[45:25] your spirit so father we pray that we
[45:27] could push back any spirit that would be
[45:29] contrary to yours in the name of Jesus
[45:32] Christ and just claim this time for you
[45:35] that Lord your mind would be in us that
[45:38] we would be in one mind and one Accord
[45:40] as we go forwards that you would just
[45:42] minister to us sovereignly according to
[45:45] your word we love you and we thank you
[45:47] we just Commit This service into your
[45:49] hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[45:51] amen amen God bless you you may be
[45:53] seated this
[45:55] morning just

[46:03] couple birthdays we wanted to

[46:09] jarmaine
[46:11] mangusi ngoy and uh she's the mother of
[46:14] brother Mila kikuji they're both
[46:17] actually January 1 birthdays and uh
[46:20] sister Priscilla kabanda is on the 4th
[46:23] so God bless you all and Happy Birthday
[46:25] to you
[46:32] just a few announcements we have no
[46:34] service on the 1st which is Wednesday
[46:36] but we do have a service on the 31st
[46:39] we'll have a communion foot Washing
[46:40] Service and testimonies and specials if
[46:43] you have specials we certainly want to
[46:45] make room for them um so that will be on
[46:48] the 31st as the world celebrates and
[46:51] brings in the new year with all of their
[46:53] uh ways we're going to do it our way and
[46:56] and uh we trust that it will just be a
[46:58] blessing for anyone who can attend are
[47:01] you happy this morning amen we have uh
[47:04] just a note I wanted to mention I got a
[47:07] an email uh a week ago from a brother
[47:11] named Emmanuel lob
[47:13] beima and he and his family are
[47:16] intending to move to Calgary Lord
[47:18] willing from
[47:20] Cameroon so if you can pray for brother
[47:23] Emmanuel and his family I spoke to I
[47:26] think it was his Pastor brother Lauren
[47:31] Aang um but I don't understand the
[47:34] connection because he said he's a pastor
[47:36] in Maryland in the US maybe he was his
[47:39] former Pastor in Cameroon I'm not quite
[47:41] sure but we certainly look forward to
[47:43] getting to know them and uh we trust the
[47:45] Lord will open the doors that need to be
[47:48] opened it certainly isn't easy to
[47:51] immigrate and uh so as uh as things
[47:55] unfold we'll certainly keep you posted
[47:57] God bless you we uh just wanted to
[48:00] continue on our discussion from the last
[48:03] time we spoke um which has been a while
[48:06] on the importance of
[48:08] Revelation and how as Christians as
[48:11] Believers there's no way that we're ever
[48:13] going to see what we need to see without
[48:16] Revelation from God because we can take
[48:19] the book The Bible and read it and it
[48:21] will be text and and and chapter and
[48:24] book and it will just become knowledge
[48:28] to us without Revelation in our lives
[48:31] and we know that Revelation only comes
[48:32] one way God bless you Brother Sam it's
[48:34] good to see you it only comes Revelation
[48:37] only comes the right Revelation only
[48:39] comes by the spirit and that spirit that
[48:41] we're talking about is Christ and it's
[48:44] real important to recognize that there
[48:46] are spirits at play that's that's right
[48:50] and there's good spirits and there's bad
[48:52] spirits how many were fed last Sunday
[48:54] with Brother John bringing his message
[48:57] we have a Graphic that we uh certainly
[48:59] can share with the church that brother
[49:01] John was using and you know we we are
[49:03] kind of caught in the middle according
[49:04] to that graphic aren't we we're we're
[49:06] we're caught in in in in the regions of
[49:08] the natural where where human beings
[49:11] exist but there's Spirits in heaven and
[49:13] their Spirits in hell and they all have
[49:15] the ability to influence us that's right
[49:19] sometimes if God desires they can
[49:21] actually manipulate the natural
[49:24] circumstances for us or against against
[49:27] us it's up to God there's nothing that
[49:29] happens outside of God being sovereignly
[49:32] involved with it and I think it's so
[49:35] incredibly important to just maybe once
[49:37] in a while remember how important it is
[49:41] that God is in control because if God is
[49:44] not in control 100% then he's not God
[49:48] it's not God maybe 95% power today and
[49:52] and maybe 99% power tomorrow and and you
[49:56] know last week something bad happened
[49:58] and it was just only 65% battery
[50:01] strength with God that's not how he
[50:03] operates God is Sovereign over the
[50:06] universe he created the heavens and the
[50:09] Earth he knows everything inside and out
[50:11] upside and down I think it's so
[50:13] beautiful how we can know by Revelation
[50:16] when we hear things sometimes they
[50:18] become a little bit more real to us we
[50:20] know that we had a prophet in our age a
[50:22] Vindicated Prophet I might add and that
[50:25] prophet he brought the the idea for us
[50:28] to recognize he even said it that our
[50:31] thoughts are louder in heaven than our
[50:33] voices are here on Earth my goodness God
[50:37] is in control he's keeping track of
[50:39] every single thing that's happening in
[50:41] our lives amen one of the things that I
[50:44] I just think is so important to even
[50:46] maybe outline and highlight just a
[50:48] little bit one of the things that the
[50:50] children of Israel did that really it
[50:52] was the only thing that the children of
[50:54] Israel did that really upset God and
[50:57] that was murmuring amen when people
[51:00] began to murmur after he delivered them
[51:03] from the bondage of Egypt they got out
[51:06] in the desert and said you know it would
[51:07] have been better for us if we would have
[51:09] just gone back to Egypt let's go back to
[51:11] the bondage that we were in at least we
[51:13] knew we could satisfy this natural flesh
[51:16] what a place that would be to live right
[51:18] but you know God was listening amen they
[51:21] thought they were slandering Moses amen
[51:24] this guy this Wild guy that took us out
[51:26] here so that we could die of starvation
[51:29] and die of maybe the misery of no water
[51:32] to
[51:33] drink but they weren't slamming
[51:36] Moses they were slamming God am right
[51:40] yes they were he's the same yesterday
[51:42] today and forever amen if we think that
[51:45] we could get away with murmuring here on
[51:47] this Earth it ain't going to happen God
[51:51] will not allow it to happen that's the
[51:53] God we serve I think it's so beautiful
[51:56] today he says in this scripture that we
[51:59] read let this mind be in you what mind
[52:04] is
[52:05] that so I wanted to take a little bit of
[52:07] a look at it and just you know under the
[52:09] the the the idea of the importance of
[52:12] Revelation recognizing that it takes
[52:14] Revelation to really understand maybe
[52:17] what I'm I'm harping about here but
[52:20] talking about the children of Israel
[52:21] coming out of bondage they they had
[52:24] severe bondage we we know that we have
[52:27] heard it said that if the Taskmaster
[52:29] desired to just take a man's wife and
[52:32] beat her he could do that and there was
[52:35] nothing the husband could
[52:36] do if he wanted to take a child of that
[52:40] family and do whatever he wanted to he
[52:42] could do it no problem and all the
[52:44] family could do was just watch and maybe
[52:47] cry out we know that it was the cries of
[52:50] the children of Israel that that God
[52:52] said you know I I've I've heard their
[52:54] cry and I've come down to visit them and
[52:57] to deliver them but how did he do it he
[52:59] didn't do it according to the banisters
[53:01] of Heaven opening up and the the
[53:03] escalator golden escalator turning on
[53:05] and all the angels and God and His holy
[53:07] procession coming down what did he do he
[53:10] lit a bush on fire and captured the
[53:12] attention of a man amen he used a man to
[53:16] come down and actually deliver the
[53:18] people
[53:20] amen it's no different
[53:22] today he uses men amen amen and when we
[53:26] murmur against those men we're not
[53:28] murmuring against those men Ain a it
[53:30] ain't what's happening we're murmuring
[53:32] against God Amen who would want to do
[53:35] that in the right mind and you know
[53:38] brothers and sisters I'll tell you what
[53:40] I'm going to be the first one to say
[53:42] guilty
[53:44] guilty you ever murmur about a man you
[53:47] ever murmur about someone else we're not
[53:50] murmuring about that person we're
[53:52] murmuring about God we need to remember
[53:54] that and we need to repent for it it we
[53:57] know that uh there was a man in the
[53:59] Bible he actually was a bad man but what
[54:02] happened was God brought correction to
[54:04] his life and what did he do he walked
[54:06] softly and God said well I'm actually I
[54:09] can see that he has repented but he's
[54:12] already sinned so now the Judgment isn't
[54:15] going to fall in his generation it'll
[54:17] just come upon his children and you know
[54:19] sometimes in our lives I feel like that
[54:21] could be what happens we live good lives
[54:23] and and and we see good lives we see
[54:25] abundance in our Liv and everything is
[54:27] fine but what happens is God's judgment
[54:29] doesn't fall in our lives he visits us
[54:33] on the second and third generation
[54:35] doesn't he
[54:36] amen we need to be careful yes but
[54:40] talking about the uh the scripture today
[54:42] let this mind be in you I think it's
[54:46] beautiful if they in Philippians 2
[54:49] verse1 if they're be therefore any
[54:51] consolation in Christ if if we can have
[54:54] any peace of mind if we can have any any
[54:57] Assurance to know that that we have
[54:59] something that's going to look after us
[55:01] if if we have any of that in Christ if
[55:03] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[55:06] the spirit any bowels of mercies he says
[55:09] fulfill ye my joy Paul speaking to the
[55:11] Philippians and every other age here not
[55:14] just the Philippians that ye be
[55:17] likeminded having the same love being of
[55:21] one Accord of one mind there's only one
[55:23] way that's going to happen and that's
[55:25] through having Having the Holy Spirit in
[55:27] your life now I know some people don't
[55:30] like hearing about that but remember
[55:32] we're in a one room Schoolhouse there's
[55:35] some veteran Elders of the message and
[55:36] there's some Junior kindergarteners in
[55:39] our midst and that's the way it is
[55:41] that's God's choice that's how he does
[55:43] it I can't help but think how the the
[55:46] the pattern I would say was set you have
[55:48] a prophet a Vindicated Prophet that
[55:50] would ask a woman who is in her 80s or
[55:52] 90s sister how long has it been since
[55:55] you got the holy ghost in your life and
[55:57] and she says she doesn't get mad and say
[56:00] why do you keep harping about the Holy
[56:01] Ghost what you don't you think I got it
[56:03] what do I got in my life why would you
[56:05] do that no she says praise God I
[56:07] remember exactly when I got it I might
[56:09] not have felt it like a lightning bolt
[56:11] but I know something happen in my life I
[56:13] started to love my brother and my
[56:15] sister I started to examine things in my
[56:18] life I started to see the word
[56:19] differently I heard the message in a
[56:21] different way something happened in my
[56:24] life that's what the Holy Ghost does
[56:26] without the Holy Ghost we can talk about
[56:28] these words here and they won't mean
[56:30] anything like we heard last Sunday we'll
[56:32] have head knowledge we be educated who
[56:36] wants to be a scholar of the word and
[56:38] not a doer of the
[56:39] word that's
[56:42] right I think it's very important for us
[56:44] to recognize we've been given an
[56:45] instruction here and and all of us need
[56:48] to be of one mind and one Accord and let
[56:52] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[56:54] Glory I'm probably going to examine
[56:57] these words but not today strife and
[57:00] vain Glory we can we can be looking for
[57:03] some accolades some folks want that
[57:05] don't they they they want a pat on the
[57:07] back they want to see their name on the
[57:10] website they want to see their name in
[57:12] print they want a business card some
[57:15] people want that but that's not what
[57:17] he's talking about here we're not we're
[57:19] not looking to see vain Glory but
[57:22] loneliness of mind let us esteem what
[57:25] what are we supposed to
[57:27] esteem
[57:29] others better than themselves my and
[57:33] look not every man on his own things but
[57:35] every man also on the things of
[57:37] others just makes me think of the story
[57:40] we know we hear it about all all the
[57:41] time I can't get away from it there was
[57:43] two in the Garden of Eden weren't there
[57:46] they're actually kicked out of the
[57:47] Garden of Eden but there was two real
[57:48] close to it that heard the stories of
[57:50] what it was like to live in the Garden
[57:51] of Eden Cain and Abel and they both went
[57:54] to church and they both worshiped
[57:56] and we know that when the correction was
[57:58] brought the the action by the one
[58:02] demonstrated whose father was his whose
[58:06] son he really was and we know that one
[58:09] his he's not in the lineage of of Adam
[58:12] it's not written in the Bible he he the
[58:15] Bible even says that he's of his father
[58:16] the evil one but we're not going to get
[58:18] into that today but what I wanted to say
[58:19] was when the correction came his
[58:22] reaction to the correction demonstrated
[58:24] who he was
[58:27] yes and we know that the word of God
[58:29] says it very clearly that if we don't
[58:31] receive correction by the word then that
[58:33] shows that we're bastards that were not
[58:35] even his children
[58:36] amen a and when the spirit of God comes
[58:39] around and brings us correction Where Do
[58:42] We Stand today because he's Hebrews 138
[58:44] isn't he isn't he the same yesterday
[58:46] today forever fully in control of every
[58:48] single situation that happens it's not
[58:51] just brother so and so chirping
[58:57] someone just
[58:58] preaching or maybe it
[59:01] is but you
[59:03] know I I just think it's wonderful for
[59:05] us to be able to look at this scripture
[59:07] and even if we can say when we look at a
[59:10] scripture like this and say you know I
[59:12] I I just struggle I just struggle doing
[59:16] things for others I just always want to
[59:18] be at the front of the line at the
[59:22] potluck I just always want to be highly
[59:25] esteemed when I come to church I always
[59:28] want to be the the the one whose name is
[59:31] mentioned at work I always want to be
[59:34] the one who's who's first in everything
[59:36] because I'm just so
[59:38] competitive but I still have a desire
[59:41] when I read this word something inside
[59:42] me says but that's what I want to be
[59:44] even though that's how I feel in this
[59:46] flesh I hate it but I want to be like
[59:50] that I want to say to you today there's
[59:52] hope amen there's hope for us cuz I know
[59:56] I read this and I think man I I know
[59:58] I've done stuff I have not esteemed
[1:00:00] others greater than me I know it I know
[1:00:02] it I know it but when I read it I think
[1:00:05] my I want to be like that I want to have
[1:00:08] that mind I want to strive to actually
[1:00:12] esteem others greater than me but what I
[1:00:14] want to get to today is let this mind be
[1:00:16] in you verse five which was also in
[1:00:19] Christ Jesus it gives us an exact
[1:00:21] pattern not just something kind of close
[1:00:24] not just something kind of wavery that
[1:00:27] maybe we would see in a in an Apostle's
[1:00:30] life we know that all the apostles were
[1:00:31] chosen very specifically for very
[1:00:33] specific reasons and we know that the
[1:00:36] one that that that many people refer to
[1:00:39] even in the Catholic church to say that
[1:00:42] you know the that Jesus told him Flesh
[1:00:44] and Blood didn't reveal it to you Peter
[1:00:46] when he asked him the story he said who
[1:00:48] who's everyone saying that I the son of
[1:00:50] manam and some said Elias and some said
[1:00:52] the prophets Jeremiah Etc and he said
[1:00:54] but who do you say and we know that by
[1:00:56] Revelation he was able to say thou art
[1:00:59] the Christ which means the sent one the
[1:01:02] deliverer the son of the Living God and
[1:01:05] Jesus God and flesh told him right there
[1:01:07] that was not from you no man taught you
[1:01:10] that your parents didn't teach you that
[1:01:12] no preacher taught you that that I
[1:01:14] didn't teach you that that came from the
[1:01:17] father above amen that was Revelation
[1:01:21] the importance of that Revelation
[1:01:23] letting this mind be in you which was
[1:01:26] also in Christ Jesus it brings the
[1:01:28] characteristics of Jesus it doesn't
[1:01:31] bring waffle characteristics where we
[1:01:33] can say today I can act like this and
[1:01:35] tomorrow I'll act the other way no no no
[1:01:39] it causes us to act a very specific way
[1:01:43] but we have been given the ability to do
[1:01:45] that it's not something that we need to
[1:01:47] try and strive for we can worry about
[1:01:51] maybe not getting there we will get
[1:01:53] there and and I would say that most of
[1:01:56] us are there many times I'll tell you I
[1:01:59] don't feel like I'm there does anybody
[1:02:02] feel like they've arrived you're ready
[1:02:04] for the body
[1:02:06] change I'm not alone then God help
[1:02:09] because our feelings brothers and
[1:02:11] sisters have nothing to do with it
[1:02:12] remember that's what the prophet of God
[1:02:14] said our feelings have nothing to do
[1:02:16] with it the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is
[1:02:18] without sensation but what happens is we
[1:02:20] line up with the word of
[1:02:22] God and what a what a wonderful thing it
[1:02:25] is to think that we have an absolute
[1:02:27] there is an absolute it's not a a a
[1:02:30] measuring tape with 14 different
[1:02:32] versions of measuring scales it's one
[1:02:36] measuring scale the word of God
[1:02:39] Amen talking about Revelation and uh and
[1:02:44] how important it is for us to have
[1:02:47] revelation we cannot enter into a body
[1:02:51] change without a
[1:02:52] revelation brother Bram said the Rapture
[1:02:55] is is a
[1:02:56] revelation we we can't actually have
[1:02:59] faith in the word of God without a
[1:03:02] revelation we have got to have a
[1:03:04] revelation we can't have faith that we
[1:03:06] can be saved unto
[1:03:08] salvation without a revelation in our
[1:03:11] lives Revelation is the critical Factor
[1:03:15] that's God himself revealing himself to
[1:03:18] us through his
[1:03:20] word I I just can't get away from uh the
[1:03:24] thought in 2 Chronicles if you want to
[1:03:26] turn over uh over there with Me 2
[1:03:29] Chronicles chap
[1:03:31] 18 we're going to take a little story
[1:03:34] today and uh I trust it's okay amen
[1:03:38] we've preached it from First Kings
[1:03:41] chapter 22 the story of the Prophet
[1:03:44] Micaiah I I think that we're all very
[1:03:46] familiar with it maybe there's some that
[1:03:48] aren't but you know I just felt led to
[1:03:50] go here so we know enough to do that in
[1:03:54] uh 2 chronic chapter
[1:03:57] 18 we'll probably read a fair bit today
[1:04:00] but I think it's important and what
[1:04:01] better thing to read than the word of
[1:04:03] God
[1:04:04] Amen first uh 2 Chronicles 18 verse1
[1:04:08] says now
[1:04:09] josephat had riches and honor in
[1:04:12] abundance and joined Affinity with
[1:04:15] Ahab and after certain years he went
[1:04:19] down to
[1:04:20] Ahab to
[1:04:22] Samaria and Ahab killed sheep and oxen
[1:04:25] for him in abundance and for and for the
[1:04:30] people that he had with him and
[1:04:32] persuaded him to go up with him to
[1:04:34] ramoth
[1:04:36] Gilead and Ahab king of Israel said unto
[1:04:40] josephat king of
[1:04:42] Judah wil thou go with me to ramoth
[1:04:46] Gilead and he answered him I am as Thou
[1:04:49] Art and my people as thy people and we
[1:04:53] will be with thee in the war
[1:04:56] and we know that ramoth Gilead was being
[1:04:59] inhabited it was actually being squatted
[1:05:02] on the enemy had taken it and made it
[1:05:06] their
[1:05:06] own and Ahab who wasn't really living
[1:05:11] according to the the measure of the word
[1:05:13] in his day he thought you know we should
[1:05:16] go after this land because it's ours and
[1:05:20] Ahab we know that he he he really
[1:05:23] misbehaved Ahab was a backslidden
[1:05:25] Christian am that's what brother Bram
[1:05:27] said he was a backslider and and in his
[1:05:30] condition he decided that he wanted to
[1:05:32] go and do something righteous and we
[1:05:34] know that wasn't the right thing to do
[1:05:37] but we know that it was all for a
[1:05:39] purpose Naturally Speaking we can look
[1:05:41] at it and say if he didn't do that
[1:05:43] perhaps he wouldn't have actually died
[1:05:46] but we know there was a prophecy for him
[1:05:48] because of what he did he he he he
[1:05:52] didn't walk softly before the Lord for a
[1:05:54] long time and and even to the place
[1:05:57] where a grown man went to take he went
[1:06:00] down to take naboth's Vineyard and
[1:06:03] naboth told him to get lost this is my
[1:06:06] inheritance you cannot have it I don't
[1:06:08] care if you're the king you can't have
[1:06:10] my inheritance and what happened was
[1:06:13] Ahab went home and pouted he went and
[1:06:15] laid up on the bed and pouted he
[1:06:17] wouldn't eat he threw a little fit grown
[1:06:20] man the
[1:06:21] king and it took his wife to come in and
[1:06:24] say what's up with you what's your
[1:06:25] problem man why aren't you busy leading
[1:06:28] our family like you should instead
[1:06:31] you're giving me the chore of actually
[1:06:33] being the one with the backbone when
[1:06:35] you're the one that ought to have it
[1:06:36] here let me figure this out what did she
[1:06:38] do she made a decree she said take these
[1:06:41] pass them out to all the people we're
[1:06:43] going to take naboth we're going to set
[1:06:44] him on high before the children of
[1:06:46] Israel he is a secret Sinner and we need
[1:06:48] to deal with them so I want you to take
[1:06:51] them out and stone them she didn't tell
[1:06:53] everyone what the what the final score
[1:06:55] was going to be but this guy he actually
[1:06:58] really messed up in his life a and he
[1:07:01] really got to the place where God said
[1:07:03] you know I just can't deal with this
[1:07:04] anymore it's just not going to carry on
[1:07:07] like this and there was a prophecy that
[1:07:08] came forward there's a word that came
[1:07:10] and said you know where where the dogs
[1:07:12] lick the blood of your wife it's going
[1:07:15] to be a bad time for both of you but uh
[1:07:18] unfortunately that's that's the way it's
[1:07:20] going to be and and we know that
[1:07:21] prophecy happened and and so here we are
[1:07:24] Ahab saying let let's go and and and
[1:07:26] deal with this and he had already just
[1:07:28] forgotten about it and that's one of the
[1:07:29] things that happens to us sometimes as
[1:07:31] as Christians I think when we backslide
[1:07:33] we can come to a place where we just
[1:07:35] forget our our our own salvation our our
[1:07:38] first love we can forget what God has
[1:07:39] done for us our eyes become dim to what
[1:07:42] he has done our memories become faint
[1:07:45] about how much of a transformation we've
[1:07:47] had in our lives and we can become a
[1:07:49] little bit pupped up and think that we
[1:07:50] cannot walk softly before the Lord and
[1:07:53] so we go and we act certain ways and
[1:07:56] here we have Ahab calling the king uh
[1:07:59] josephat to come down let's go to war
[1:08:00] and let's take our
[1:08:02] land not knowing that all he's doing is
[1:08:05] bringing to pass the word of the Lord
[1:08:06] wasn't he and josephat said this is
[1:08:09] verse four of second Chronicles chapter
[1:08:12] 18 josephat said unto the king of Israel
[1:08:15] inquire I pray thee at the word of the
[1:08:18] Lord today therefore the king of Israel
[1:08:21] gathered together of the prophets 400
[1:08:24] men and said unto them shall we go go to
[1:08:29] ramoth Gilead to battle or shall I
[1:08:33] forbear and they said go up for God will
[1:08:38] deliver it into the king's
[1:08:40] hand but josaphat said is there not here
[1:08:45] a prophet of the Lord besides that we
[1:08:49] might inquire of him and you know the
[1:08:52] prophet he said very clearly that
[1:08:54] josephat wasn't a back slider he said
[1:08:57] that he actually knew what was going on
[1:09:00] in this church in in in the behavior of
[1:09:02] these people and that's why he said that
[1:09:05] and and it's interesting to see that he
[1:09:07] would have that that understanding you
[1:09:09] know the 400
[1:09:12] prophets prophesying go up take the land
[1:09:15] what more do you need you've got full
[1:09:16] permission don't you I mean did they
[1:09:19] take the time to examine an interview
[1:09:22] each and every one 400 Prophets brother
[1:09:25] bradam said they were God prophets they
[1:09:28] weren't backsliders he called them God
[1:09:31] prophets is there not hear a prophet of
[1:09:35] the Lord besides that we might inquire
[1:09:38] of him and the king of Israel said unto
[1:09:41] josephat there is yet one man yeah by
[1:09:45] whom we may inquire of the
[1:09:48] Lord oh but I hate
[1:09:51] him and why did he hate
[1:09:53] him we know the word say says it here he
[1:09:56] hated him because he never prophesied
[1:09:59] good unto me but always evil How could a
[1:10:03] God sent Prophet a Vindicated Prophet
[1:10:06] ever prophesy good about anybody who is
[1:10:08] a
[1:10:10] backslider the only thing he's going to
[1:10:12] do is bring judgment he's going to bring
[1:10:14] correction get back to the word of God
[1:10:17] Amen stop your shenanigans and get right
[1:10:21] with God that's all
[1:10:23] amen but isn't it interesting his
[1:10:25] reaction to it one more time he's got
[1:10:28] the opportunity someone else God's using
[1:10:31] someone else to bring the situation to
[1:10:33] pass one more chance to maybe accept the
[1:10:36] word of a god Prophet but yet he says no
[1:10:39] I hate him just because of every single
[1:10:41] time that I've been misbehaving all he's
[1:10:43] done has brought me correction and I
[1:10:45] could just never accept that alls he
[1:10:47] could do is just maybe handle me a
[1:10:48] little bit differently and then I would
[1:10:51] accept the correction how many times in
[1:10:53] our lives brothers and sisters do we
[1:10:54] actually go down that road where we say
[1:10:57] that maybe if the preacher would just
[1:10:59] handle me a little bit differently then
[1:11:01] I would get in line with the word of
[1:11:03] God God's using that man God's using
[1:11:07] that person to get us back in line he's
[1:11:09] not going to say oh I know you didn't
[1:11:11] like that the way that that brother he
[1:11:13] was just Rough Around the Edges that way
[1:11:15] and you just couldn't accept the
[1:11:16] correction according to my
[1:11:19] word it's not going to work we won't
[1:11:21] have that
[1:11:23] ability and the of Israel said unto
[1:11:26] josephat there is yet One Man by whom we
[1:11:29] may inquire of the Lord but I hate him
[1:11:34] for he never prophesied good unto me but
[1:11:36] always evil always
[1:11:39] evil that same is Micaiah the son of
[1:11:42] imla and josephat said let not the king
[1:11:45] say so don't be so hard on him why would
[1:11:49] you be so hard amen remember josephat
[1:11:52] knew who this Ahab was he knew who his
[1:11:54] wife was was he knew how they
[1:11:57] behaved and the king of Israel called
[1:11:59] for one of his officers and said fetch
[1:12:02] quickly makayah the son of imla and the
[1:12:05] king of Israel and josephat king of
[1:12:08] Judah sat either of them on his throne
[1:12:11] clothed in their robes and they sat in a
[1:12:14] void place at the entering of the Gate
[1:12:17] of Samaria and all the prophets
[1:12:20] prophesied before them you could just
[1:12:22] imagine what that service must have been
[1:12:23] like hey they were having a wonderful
[1:12:26] service of Prophecy probably singing
[1:12:29] probably tremendous church service and
[1:12:33] zedekiah the son of chenai had made him
[1:12:37] horns of iron and said thus saith the
[1:12:40] Lord amen boy it changes everything when
[1:12:44] we hear thus sayith the Lord doesn't
[1:12:46] it thus saith the Lord with these Thou
[1:12:51] shalt push Syria until they be consumed
[1:12:55] and now I I just personally brothers and
[1:12:57] sisters have to say this there ain't no
[1:13:00] man-made Solution that's going to deal
[1:13:02] with a spiritual problem that's not
[1:13:05] going to happen amen and this God
[1:13:08] Prophet was bringing a man-made solution
[1:13:11] to a a a spiritual problem how on Earth
[1:13:15] could they ever succeed pushing out
[1:13:18] Syria with irons of horn horns of iron
[1:13:21] how could they ever do that that's not
[1:13:23] going to happen but but here we are
[1:13:26] zedekiah the son of chenai had made him
[1:13:28] horns of iron and said thus saith the
[1:13:30] Lord with these Thou shalt push out
[1:13:33] Syria until they be consumed what if he
[1:13:36] would have said by the armies of the
[1:13:38] Living God will you push out
[1:13:41] Syria but he had a man-made solution for
[1:13:44] this problem right and all the prophets
[1:13:48] prophesied so saying go up to ramoth
[1:13:51] Gilead and
[1:13:53] prosper for the Lord shall deliver it
[1:13:56] into the hand of the
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:00] king I I think this is real real good
[1:14:03] here and the messenger that went to call
[1:14:06] Micaiah spake to him and said behold the
[1:14:10] words of the prophets declare good to
[1:14:12] the king with one
[1:14:15] Ascent boy let the word therefore I pray
[1:14:20] thee be like one of theirs and speak
[1:14:23] thou good
[1:14:27] it would be a tough thing to
[1:14:29] discern you got 400 prophets over here
[1:14:32] and one over here how are you going to
[1:14:33] know the
[1:14:34] difference this is what I want to get to
[1:14:36] it's got to be spiritual Revelation am
[1:14:39] there's only one way you're going to
[1:14:40] know the difference there's only one way
[1:14:44] verse 13 and Micaiah said as the Lord
[1:14:47] liveth even what my God saith that will
[1:14:51] I
[1:14:51] speak now personally I would have to say
[1:14:55] if I was looking for a prophet that was
[1:14:57] a real Prophet one that was really tuned
[1:15:00] in with God I'd be listening to hear
[1:15:02] those words the words that say only what
[1:15:05] God says that's what I'm going to speak
[1:15:08] and it's got nothing to do with how I
[1:15:10] feel it's got nothing to do with what I
[1:15:12] know it's got nothing to do with what my
[1:15:14] tenure is or my experience it's only got
[1:15:17] to do with what the word of God
[1:15:21] is amen and when he was come to the king
[1:15:25] the king said unto him Micaiah shall we
[1:15:29] go shall we go to ramoth Gilead to
[1:15:33] battle or shall I forbear exact same
[1:15:36] question I mean it's pretty fair right
[1:15:39] if you're really examining it maybe
[1:15:41] scientifically or naturally like there's
[1:15:43] same question shall we forbear and he
[1:15:46] said go go ye up and prosper and they
[1:15:49] shall deliver it into your
[1:15:51] hand interesting that he would say it
[1:15:54] exactly the way he was
[1:15:56] instructed right but something
[1:15:58] constrained these others to say I I
[1:16:00] don't know what this guy's problem is
[1:16:02] now he's shoting now he's actually just
[1:16:05] being difficult with us he's just
[1:16:06] mocking us now
[1:16:08] right just go it'll be just like you
[1:16:11] said just like your Prophet said and the
[1:16:13] King said unto him how many times shall
[1:16:15] I adjure Thee that thou say nothing but
[1:16:18] the truth to me in the name of the Lord
[1:16:20] he came and said exactly what he wanted
[1:16:24] and that wasn't good good
[1:16:26] enough isn't that the way it is with
[1:16:28] some
[1:16:30] people and the king of Israel said to
[1:16:33] josephat did I not tell thee that he
[1:16:36] would not prophesy good unto me but evil
[1:16:40] oh I jumped to the verse I jumped the
[1:16:42] most important verse didn't I verse
[1:16:44] 16 then he said I see all Israel
[1:16:47] scattered upon the mountain as sheep
[1:16:49] that have no Shepherd and the Lord said
[1:16:52] these have no master let them return
[1:16:54] therefore every man to his house in
[1:16:57] peace and we know the king of Israel
[1:17:00] said to josephat didn't I tell you this
[1:17:03] guy wouldn't prophesy good but
[1:17:06] evil and again he said therefore hear
[1:17:09] the word of the Lord this is what I
[1:17:11] wanted to get to today brothers and
[1:17:13] sisters and just examine it a little bit
[1:17:16] we go from looking at the natural realm
[1:17:19] now we're going to change the camera as
[1:17:21] brother Bram says in different places
[1:17:23] we're going to change the view the
[1:17:25] perspective and we're going to step into
[1:17:26] the Heavenly realm we're going to we're
[1:17:28] going to see things from a different
[1:17:30] perspective here and again he said
[1:17:32] therefore hear the word of the Lord this
[1:17:35] is what you ask for now you have to have
[1:17:38] it now it's coming I saw the Lord
[1:17:41] sitting on his throne and all the host
[1:17:43] of Heaven standing on the
[1:17:46] right hand and on his
[1:17:49] left and the Lord said who shall entice
[1:17:53] Ahab king of Israel that he may go up
[1:17:57] and fall at ramoth Gilead amen and One S
[1:18:02] spake saying after this manner and
[1:18:05] another saying after that manner now
[1:18:07] this is all in heaven remember this is
[1:18:09] not down on Earth this is not in in a in
[1:18:12] a king's chamber this is all around the
[1:18:14] Throne of
[1:18:16] God then there came out a spirit and
[1:18:19] stood before the Lord and he said I will
[1:18:22] entice him
[1:18:25] and the Lord said unto him wherewith how
[1:18:27] you going to do
[1:18:29] it and he said I will go out and be a
[1:18:33] lying spirit in the mouth of All His
[1:18:39] prophets
[1:18:41] my not in the mouth of his soldiers not
[1:18:44] in the mouth of his family not in the
[1:18:46] mouth of the citizens of the
[1:18:48] Kingdom but in the mouth of His
[1:18:51] prophets very very very treacherous
[1:18:55] isn't it yes very treacherous how on
[1:18:59] Earth we say it that way but it applies
[1:19:02] how on Earth would we ever know the
[1:19:04] difference there's no way on Earth we
[1:19:06] would ever know the difference it's got
[1:19:07] to be his mind in us to know the
[1:19:10] difference that's good and outside of
[1:19:13] that we will be just as lost as those
[1:19:15] 400 God
[1:19:17] prophets even though we know the message
[1:19:19] of the
[1:19:20] hour they came out a spirit that stood
[1:19:24] before for the Lord and said I will
[1:19:26] entice him and he said unto him
[1:19:28] wherewith and he said I will go out and
[1:19:30] be a lying spirit in the mouth of All
[1:19:33] His prophets and the Lord said Thou
[1:19:35] shalt entice him and thou shalt also
[1:19:40] Prevail God gave him permission to go
[1:19:44] and do exactly what he said go out and
[1:19:48] do even
[1:19:50] so now therefore behold the Lord hath
[1:19:54] put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
[1:19:57] these prophets and the Lord hath spoken
[1:20:00] evil against
[1:20:02] thee can you imagine that day there we
[1:20:06] have the one God Prophet that was called
[1:20:08] out after all that that was said that
[1:20:11] was exactly according to the the
[1:20:14] theological teachings of the day we know
[1:20:17] that the ministerial associations they
[1:20:19] were all in Alliance with it all all of
[1:20:22] the the denominational chur churches
[1:20:25] they were in Alliance with it everyone
[1:20:27] was on board 400 God prophets were
[1:20:30] completely ready to just say yeah go on
[1:20:33] and take the kingdom it's ours Naturally
[1:20:35] Speaking everything lined up it was
[1:20:38] their land they had occupiers on it and
[1:20:41] nobody had right to that land except for
[1:20:43] the children of Israel but yet somehow
[1:20:46] some way there was a desire to hear one
[1:20:49] more word and that word is really what I
[1:20:51] want to preach about today brothers and
[1:20:53] sisters
[1:20:55] to think about
[1:20:57] it this is sort of what I do it's the
[1:21:00] punchline there ain't one of us that
[1:21:02] lives in this natural world in this life
[1:21:05] and doesn't have conversations just like
[1:21:08] this happening in heaven about us this
[1:21:11] is not just about God's Prophet even
[1:21:15] though that's the story that's painted
[1:21:17] it's actually about every single human
[1:21:20] being every single place in every
[1:21:22] situation all the time amen nothing
[1:21:26] happens unless God is
[1:21:28] involved
[1:21:31] nothing now some would say brother Barry
[1:21:33] that's going a bit far but remember
[1:21:35] we're not talking about man we're not
[1:21:37] talking about AI we're not talking about
[1:21:40] all that human beings can try and put
[1:21:42] together and muster up we're talking
[1:21:44] about God amen amen it goes beyond our
[1:21:48] comprehension we come to the place
[1:21:50] that's just beyond where our brains
[1:21:52] start to glitch where we just can't get
[1:21:54] asked it this is God he's as big as big
[1:21:57] can ever be and as small infinitely
[1:22:01] small it's God he knows everything in
[1:22:05] between but here we have this story
[1:22:08] painted in heaven I just think it's so
[1:22:11] wonderful to hear it in the word to to
[1:22:13] to read the story and see that you know
[1:22:16] there there's actually I I preached on
[1:22:18] this years ago and even once in Africa
[1:22:20] about there being a council in heaven
[1:22:22] and brother Bram says it there's a
[1:22:23] council in heaven for you that's
[1:22:25] actually a quote I'm not bringing it
[1:22:27] today but brother brandham says that
[1:22:29] about our situations our lives I'm not
[1:22:32] just making this up God says it when we
[1:22:34] have a situation in our life he's well
[1:22:36] aware of where we're at and what we're
[1:22:38] going
[1:22:40] through and I think it's just beautiful
[1:22:42] because when we pray he's
[1:22:45] listening he's not actually ignoring us
[1:22:48] he's wanting to see where we
[1:22:50] stand but this story is also told in
[1:22:53] First Kings chapter 22 and you know
[1:22:57] talking about this in light of
[1:22:58] Revelation if we can have the Revelation
[1:23:01] if we can have the understanding in our
[1:23:03] lives that you know there's nothing
[1:23:05] happening that God's surprised about he
[1:23:08] he he ain't a Doty old grandpa up there
[1:23:10] ring in his hands when situations happen
[1:23:13] on the earth and and and it sounds like
[1:23:15] things are out of control and maybe this
[1:23:16] country is going and taking over that
[1:23:18] other country and maybe this thing is
[1:23:21] happening and and somebody else is sick
[1:23:23] unto death and God is just ringing his
[1:23:25] hands like a Dodie old grandpa that's
[1:23:27] not what's happening at all it's a
[1:23:30] totally different thing it's exactly
[1:23:31] like we're reading here in this story he
[1:23:33] is saying in heaven who's going to get
[1:23:35] my will to come to pass in brother so
[1:23:37] and so's life or sister so and so's life
[1:23:40] or in that church or in that City or
[1:23:42] whatever it is we're talking about God
[1:23:45] here yes amen I think it's so beautiful
[1:23:48] to know that we have got the Revelation
[1:23:51] about who we are in the day in which we
[1:23:53] live we've got the Revelation to know
[1:23:55] that we have had a god prophet in our
[1:23:58] day call us back to the word of God and
[1:24:01] and and by that we've been given the
[1:24:04] keys to the kingdom which is just
[1:24:06] incredible you know we heard about it
[1:24:08] last week we have we we we look at it
[1:24:10] naturally and when we have a real
[1:24:12] serious incident or situation they call
[1:24:14] in the SWAT team right but we are the
[1:24:17] SWAT
[1:24:18] team he has given us special weapons and
[1:24:21] tactics amen and the greatest weapon
[1:24:23] that we have have is letting his mind be
[1:24:26] in US amen letting his mind be in us and
[1:24:30] cause us to act according to his word
[1:24:33] when we have that there's nothing that
[1:24:36] can stand in our way you know brother
[1:24:38] brandham said that we've got a nuclear
[1:24:40] bomb for the
[1:24:42] devil we can actually just give it to
[1:24:44] him put it in his lap and say there you
[1:24:46] go and how does that work that's by
[1:24:48] prayer amen amen that's by going on our
[1:24:51] knees and praying that's by taking the
[1:24:53] time with the Lord
[1:24:54] and and and we all can never do too much
[1:24:57] of it that's the one thing brother Bram
[1:24:58] said we'll never do too much of and
[1:25:00] that's praying but we know that Paul
[1:25:02] said that we should pray without ceasing
[1:25:04] and I I think that's a wonderful thing
[1:25:06] we can pray in many different ways we
[1:25:08] can have song prayer we can have thought
[1:25:11] prayer we can have word prayer there's
[1:25:13] many different types of prayer brothers
[1:25:15] and sisters but I I say the same thing
[1:25:17] what Paul said that's what we preach is
[1:25:18] what Paul preached just just pray
[1:25:20] without ceasing and you know when the
[1:25:22] word of God comes around don't let let
[1:25:24] it actually cause us to become defensive
[1:25:27] and maybe aggressive but let us just
[1:25:29] humble ourselves we sang that song just
[1:25:31] put me on the on the potter's wheel and
[1:25:34] mold me and shape me do we really want
[1:25:36] that to happen it doesn't feel good in
[1:25:37] our flesh when we get molded and shaped
[1:25:41] it it actually is uncomfortable many
[1:25:44] times but boy when it happens it sure
[1:25:47] feels good what what happens when we get
[1:25:49] correction in our lives when we get
[1:25:50] reshaped just a little bit it it it
[1:25:53] causes the the the fruit the Peaceable
[1:25:59] fruit to come forward in our lives that
[1:26:02] that that just passes all understanding
[1:26:05] we have the ability to to actually grow
[1:26:07] and we know that that's how we grow by
[1:26:10] learning by by correction in our lives
[1:26:12] and and every one of us needs it I I
[1:26:14] probably need it the most it's it's the
[1:26:16] way the Lord chose to do it you know and
[1:26:19] thank goodness for parents that aren't
[1:26:20] afraid to bring correction to their
[1:26:22] children there there's a world that we
[1:26:24] live live in now where parents actually
[1:26:26] believe that you don't need to bring
[1:26:28] correction to the children where you can
[1:26:29] just say yes to them and whatever they
[1:26:31] want just give it to them whenever they
[1:26:33] want it just give it to them it doesn't
[1:26:34] matter somehow some way it'll all work
[1:26:37] out and and it won't work out you're
[1:26:39] you're you're training the children to
[1:26:41] grow up to be adult children and if you
[1:26:44] think it's bad to see a little child
[1:26:46] throw a fit try seeing an adult throw a
[1:26:48] fit it's ridiculous but that's what this
[1:26:51] world is turning into
[1:26:55] people thinking that they can just
[1:26:56] behave however they will yeah
[1:26:58] everything's the same since the fathers
[1:27:00] fell asleep right nothing is changing oh
[1:27:04] my it's changing it's changing
[1:27:06] rapidly you know only Revelation from
[1:27:10] God will help us in the day in which we
[1:27:12] live when we look at this story here and
[1:27:16] think about the story of Ahab if if we
[1:27:19] were to go further and and see maybe we
[1:27:21] can just carry on and and and read this
[1:27:23] we got a bit of time
[1:27:28] here we'll pick up from verse 22 of 2
[1:27:31] Chronicles chap 18 now therefore behold
[1:27:34] the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the
[1:27:36] mouth of thy these thy prophets and the
[1:27:40] Lord hath spoken evil against thee then
[1:27:44] zedekiah the son of chanah came near a
[1:27:48] and smot Micaiah upon the cheek this is
[1:27:52] the god Prophet remember the one who
[1:27:55] thought that he was the one he he was
[1:27:56] the highest esteemed of the bunch he
[1:27:59] liked to have his name and the lights
[1:28:00] and everybody to to to acknowledge him
[1:28:03] he liked to be that guy zedekiah and
[1:28:06] what did he do with Micaiah he came and
[1:28:08] he smoted him on the cheek and said
[1:28:10] which which way went the spirit of Lord
[1:28:12] from from me to speak unto thee like H
[1:28:14] how could you possibly think that you
[1:28:16] have anything to say and Micaiah said
[1:28:19] behold Thou shalt see on the day when
[1:28:22] thou shalt go into an inner chamber to
[1:28:25] hide thyself now I'm going to bring a
[1:28:27] quote and I think it's wonderful to hear
[1:28:29] how the prophet in our day paraphrases
[1:28:32] that scripture he doesn't add to it or
[1:28:34] take away from it he's not doing that he
[1:28:36] just says it in his own way and I think
[1:28:38] it's a pretty interesting thing verse 25
[1:28:42] then the king of Israel said take he
[1:28:44] makayah and carry him back to Ammon the
[1:28:47] governor of the city and to joash the
[1:28:50] King's son and say thus saith the king
[1:28:55] put this fellow in prison and feed him
[1:28:57] with bread of Affliction and with water
[1:28:59] of Affliction until I return in peace
[1:29:01] now just to be clear he's not saying to
[1:29:04] him take him back and give him the three
[1:29:06] Square meals a day like you would get in
[1:29:08] prison here in Canada he's saying take
[1:29:10] him back and punch his lights out and
[1:29:13] throw him in the pit and then dump water
[1:29:15] on him wake him up and slap him around
[1:29:18] again pour some Affliction on that boy
[1:29:21] don't treat him nicely because what did
[1:29:23] he do he embarrassed me oh no he
[1:29:26] embarrassed me in front of all the
[1:29:28] Ministerial Association he had another
[1:29:31] word a word from God that it embarrassed
[1:29:34] me and it hurt my pride it really
[1:29:36] tarnished my image now what am I ever
[1:29:38] going to do the king said take them and
[1:29:41] slap him around let them know who boss
[1:29:43] around here and and it's amazing because
[1:29:45] I can't help but think one day we're
[1:29:47] going to see an account for this exact
[1:29:50] story this exact scripture we're going
[1:29:53] to see Ahab have to actually give an
[1:29:55] account for the way that this man was
[1:29:57] treated God's
[1:29:59] Prophet my and maaya said
[1:30:03] behold Thou shalt see on that day when
[1:30:06] thou shalt go into an inner chamber to
[1:30:08] hide thyself because you're going to
[1:30:10] hide then the king of Israel said take
[1:30:13] him carry him back to Ammon the governor
[1:30:15] of the city to joash the King's son and
[1:30:17] say thus saith the king put this fellow
[1:30:19] in prison and feed him with bread of
[1:30:21] Affliction and water of Affliction until
[1:30:23] I return in peace listen to the boldness
[1:30:27] of this guy and Micaiah
[1:30:30] said if thou certainly return in peace
[1:30:34] then hath not the Lord spoken by me amen
[1:30:38] and he said hearken all ye people pay
[1:30:41] attention to my words remember what I
[1:30:44] said because it ain't going to turn out
[1:30:46] the way you think so the king of Israel
[1:30:49] and josephat the king of Judah went up
[1:30:51] to ramoth Gilead and the king of Israel
[1:30:54] said unto josaphat I will disguise
[1:30:58] myself and go into the battle why would
[1:31:01] he do that why would he go anywhere near
[1:31:04] the
[1:31:05] battle I I just think that's amazing
[1:31:07] it's quite
[1:31:09] bold go right into the
[1:31:11] battle but put thou on thy robes so the
[1:31:15] king of Israel disguised himself and
[1:31:17] they went to the battle now the king of
[1:31:19] Syria had commanded the captains of the
[1:31:21] Chariots that were with him saying fight
[1:31:23] ye not with small or great save only
[1:31:27] with the king of Israel and it came to
[1:31:29] pass when the captains of the Chariots
[1:31:32] saw
[1:31:34] josaphat that they said it is the king
[1:31:36] of Israel therefore they compassed about
[1:31:39] him to fight but josaphat cried out and
[1:31:43] what the Lord helped him he wasn't as
[1:31:46] backslid as
[1:31:48] Ahab and God moved them to depart from
[1:31:51] him isn't that wonderful to think about
[1:31:54] brothers and sisters we can find
[1:31:56] ourselves Tangled Up in situations if we
[1:31:58] are not careful right we might think
[1:32:01] that it's just fine to hang out with a
[1:32:03] backslider and it's good to encourage
[1:32:05] backsliders but be very careful because
[1:32:09] they might take you into a battle that
[1:32:11] you can't handle and it might not just
[1:32:14] be a Temptation whereby oh my suddenly
[1:32:16] you're just tempted suddenly you just
[1:32:18] got this overwhelming Temptation it
[1:32:20] could be something that maybe comes upon
[1:32:23] maybe one of your parents that we could
[1:32:25] bring around because of our Behavior
[1:32:27] hanging out with that person maybe
[1:32:29] hanging out with that person could bring
[1:32:30] something upon one of our children we
[1:32:33] need to know exactly where we
[1:32:35] stand but I want to say this don't
[1:32:38] forget this verse here even though I've
[1:32:40] said things the way I've said just now
[1:32:42] therefore they compassed about him to
[1:32:44] fight many times there's Devils that
[1:32:46] Compass about us to fight but josephat
[1:32:49] cried out and the Lord helped him we
[1:32:52] could see the Lord help us too in our
[1:32:54] lives and God moved them to depart from
[1:32:58] him for it came to pass that when the
[1:33:00] captains of the Chariots perceived that
[1:33:02] it was not the king of Israel it wasn't
[1:33:04] who they wanted they turned back again
[1:33:06] from pursuing him and a certain man drew
[1:33:09] a bow at a venture just to a guess just
[1:33:12] saw someone tracking along there anybody
[1:33:15] ever shoot a bow before you know what
[1:33:16] I'm talking about he saw someone just
[1:33:19] out there and just just took a guess
[1:33:21] just let it just enough just gave it
[1:33:23] enough Ark and just let it go on a
[1:33:26] venture and Let It
[1:33:29] Go my and smok the king of Israel
[1:33:33] between the joints of the harness he hid
[1:33:36] him therefore he said to his Chariot man
[1:33:39] turn thine hand that thou mayest carry
[1:33:41] me out of the host for I am
[1:33:44] wounded and the battle increased that
[1:33:46] day how be it the king of Israel stayed
[1:33:49] himself up in his Chariot against the
[1:33:51] syrians until the even
[1:33:55] and about the time of the sun going down
[1:33:57] he died he got that arrow that Arrow it
[1:34:02] was just thrown at Adventure someone
[1:34:05] just thought you know I'm going to try
[1:34:07] and take a poke at this guy and and see
[1:34:09] what happens with my arrow I can't help
[1:34:11] but imagine that that Arrow was ordained
[1:34:13] of God it was exactly drawn by the right
[1:34:16] person had exactly the right time it had
[1:34:19] exactly the right weight exactly the
[1:34:21] right tip on the end of it it was
[1:34:23] exactly according to the word of God
[1:34:26] there was no accidental mistakes here or
[1:34:29] anything this was exactly according to
[1:34:32] the word of God according to the way the
[1:34:34] Lord said it would happen too and what
[1:34:36] happened is he didn't just lay there in
[1:34:38] the field I'm not going to go on about
[1:34:40] it but he didn't just lay there in the
[1:34:41] field fall out of his Chariot his
[1:34:43] Chariot went right back to where the
[1:34:44] dogs lick the blood out of the Chariot
[1:34:47] and off the concrete where they washed
[1:34:49] that Chariot out it's pretty terrible
[1:34:52] but it's true God is very aware of our
[1:34:56] situations he's very aware of Our Lives
[1:34:58] he knows exactly where we're at and when
[1:35:00] he brings us the correction according to
[1:35:03] the word our reaction will determine the
[1:35:07] outcome I think it's so beautiful I got
[1:35:09] a fairly long quote I'm going to read
[1:35:11] here out of anointed ones at the end
[1:35:13] time in
[1:35:14] 1965 William Mariam branam the
[1:35:17] Vindicated Prophet for this age amen he
[1:35:21] says he says here now here was that
[1:35:24] aaya thinking he was right he was the
[1:35:28] man that just loved to be
[1:35:31] esteemed Micaiah said let me ask God so
[1:35:35] he come down the next morning with thus
[1:35:38] saith the Lord he checked his vision
[1:35:40] with the word and you know brothers and
[1:35:43] sisters that's the critical factor for
[1:35:44] any one of us whether we say that we
[1:35:48] believe or understand that that God set
[1:35:50] a prophet in our age or not are we
[1:35:52] willing to actually align ourselves with
[1:35:54] the word of God many people say they are
[1:35:57] but not all the way they'll say that
[1:35:59] there's some sort of a cultural change
[1:36:01] something happened somewhere along the
[1:36:02] way maybe we're not living in an
[1:36:04] Apostolic age anymore who who knows what
[1:36:06] it could be but here here we have the
[1:36:09] the god Prophet saying let me just go
[1:36:11] and check it with the word I got a
[1:36:12] vision but I want to make sure it lines
[1:36:14] up with the word of
[1:36:15] God now if he would have said to
[1:36:18] zedekiah do you know what the prophet of
[1:36:21] the Bible here said would happen to this
[1:36:25] guy but not at this time because this
[1:36:27] man is an honorable man he is trying
[1:36:30] don't fail to get this he says he is
[1:36:33] trying to give back to the church the
[1:36:36] things that belongs to the church he's
[1:36:39] trying to give back its property back
[1:36:42] not the spiritual things he's trying to
[1:36:45] get the
[1:36:48] land he would have shook that whole
[1:36:51] nation like Elijah did but trying to
[1:36:54] give them the material things we own
[1:36:57] property we're a great
[1:36:59] organization we belong to it well all
[1:37:03] all you people you Protestants should
[1:37:06] all join with us
[1:37:09] uhhuh we're coming to that in a little
[1:37:11] bit it's all brothers and sisters anyhow
[1:37:14] isn't it never was and never will be
[1:37:18] with the real genuine Church of God it
[1:37:21] can't be it never was in in the Bible
[1:37:25] the the the real Believers were always
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:28] minorities right amen
[1:37:31] notice he saw the vision and so he said
[1:37:35] God spoke to me now Look the man was
[1:37:38] sincere and he said he said make these
[1:37:41] horns and go up before the king and push
[1:37:44] Westward or whichever the way the land
[1:37:46] laid from from where they were standing
[1:37:49] push and that'll be thus saith the Lord
[1:37:53] the he's going to win the Victory and
[1:37:55] come back a victory for the church my
[1:38:00] going to drive them out that's pretty
[1:38:02] close isn't it he's going to do
[1:38:05] something real special for the
[1:38:08] church here come
[1:38:10] Micaiah down said now you give your
[1:38:15] prophecy go on up but I seen Israel like
[1:38:19] sheep scattered having no
[1:38:22] Shepherd yeah exactly vice
[1:38:25] versa the 400 God prophets yes anointed
[1:38:29] by God doing something really good for
[1:38:32] the
[1:38:33] church and then you have one on the
[1:38:35] other hand bringing something real
[1:38:38] strong and seemingly
[1:38:41] nasty brother bam he says it's exactly
[1:38:43] vice versa now you're the congregation
[1:38:46] now which one is right both of them
[1:38:48] Prophets The only way you can tell the
[1:38:52] difference in them is check it by the
[1:38:54] word amen amen now brother Barry's going
[1:38:57] to say you could read the word a and you
[1:39:00] could see the situation and and you
[1:39:03] could say by
[1:39:05] knowledge I understand the word is
[1:39:08] actually contrary to that but Naturally
[1:39:11] Speaking we're not going to bring the
[1:39:14] right answers or the right results
[1:39:16] there's no way that we're actually going
[1:39:18] to see a a a spiritual solution with a
[1:39:23] natural
[1:39:24] answer just reading the Bible on its own
[1:39:27] getting head knowledge it's not going to
[1:39:30] do it for us it has to be a revelation
[1:39:33] amen and that Revelation in our day is
[1:39:36] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:39:40] amen it's not about a prophet yes we
[1:39:44] understand that God uses prophets to
[1:39:46] speak to men and and that has to be the
[1:39:48] way it is because of his word Amos 3:7
[1:39:53] we know that scripture surely God will
[1:39:56] do
[1:39:57] nothing nothing
[1:40:00] amen I could say it again nothing surely
[1:40:03] God will do nothing unless he reveals it
[1:40:06] first through His prophets
[1:40:11] amen here we have the prophets here now
[1:40:14] which one is right the one that's
[1:40:16] actually according to the word the one
[1:40:19] that's willing to actually take everyone
[1:40:22] back to the word even if it goes against
[1:40:25] popular opinion that's right just
[1:40:27] because everyone else is doing something
[1:40:30] don't mean it's right yes just because
[1:40:34] everyone else says something it don't
[1:40:36] mean it's
[1:40:38] right the only thing that's right is
[1:40:40] God's word amen he says now you're the
[1:40:43] congregation now which one is right both
[1:40:45] of them Prophets The only way you can
[1:40:47] tell the difference in them is check it
[1:40:49] by the word how you ever going to check
[1:40:51] it by the word if you don't have the
[1:40:52] Holy Ghost
[1:40:54] how you going to have an understanding
[1:40:55] of the word the way you're supposed to
[1:40:57] have an understanding of the word unless
[1:40:59] this mind which was in Christ is also in
[1:41:02] you how you ever going to get that mind
[1:41:04] in you just by reading the word of God
[1:41:05] it ain't going to happen you got to have
[1:41:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ that that
[1:41:09] actual baptism of the Holy Spirit has
[1:41:12] got to be in our lives then when we read
[1:41:14] this word it becomes a new book to us
[1:41:16] that's how we're going to see the
[1:41:18] difference said how do you get this he
[1:41:20] said I saw God sitting on a throne said
[1:41:23] I saw all the counsil around him now
[1:41:27] remember
[1:41:28] zedekiah said he just saw God
[1:41:32] too yeah In The Same Spirit I saw God he
[1:41:37] told me to make these horns out of iron
[1:41:40] the natural
[1:41:43] solution something natural and man-made
[1:41:45] we're going to take to solve this
[1:41:47] spiritual
[1:41:49] problem in the same spirit I saw God he
[1:41:51] told me to make these horns of iron out
[1:41:54] of iron go out there and push the
[1:41:56] Nations out of here for this belongs to
[1:41:58] us the others ain't got no right into it
[1:42:02] they would if they stayed right with God
[1:42:06] they would have had that but they got
[1:42:08] away from
[1:42:10] God that's the way the organization is
[1:42:13] the
[1:42:14] church it's got a right to these things
[1:42:17] everyone has a right to these things
[1:42:19] brothers and sisters all the
[1:42:21] organizations have a right to these
[1:42:26] things but you have been cheated out of
[1:42:28] it because you got away from God's word
[1:42:32] and God's spirit
[1:42:33] anointing to vindicate the word of the
[1:42:36] Season amen this going to pause there
[1:42:39] for a second because I'm not I'm brother
[1:42:42] Barry just ain't making this up here
[1:42:43] this is what the prophet of God said
[1:42:45] amen we've been cheated out of these
[1:42:48] promises if we're not seeing them in our
[1:42:50] lives because he's given them to us but
[1:42:52] the only way we're going to get them is
[1:42:55] by his Revelation in US God's spirit
[1:43:00] anointing to vindicate the word of the
[1:43:03] season to be able to say that yes indeed
[1:43:06] God did send a Vindicated Prophet nobody
[1:43:08] had a healing campaign like him nobody
[1:43:10] could discern the thoughts that were in
[1:43:12] the hearts of men it wasn't just a man
[1:43:15] standing there it wasn't just a a human
[1:43:18] being from the backwoods of Kentucky it
[1:43:20] was God standing in his man just just
[1:43:23] like in Micaiah it was God standing in
[1:43:25] his men giving him the words to speak
[1:43:27] the vision about where they stood and
[1:43:30] they had to have the they had to have
[1:43:32] the spirit of God to understand how on
[1:43:35] Earth could they ever understand it
[1:43:37] outside of God being in them now some
[1:43:41] might say brother Barry they didn't
[1:43:42] actually God didn't give the Holy Ghost
[1:43:44] back then I'll tell you what God gave
[1:43:46] the Holy Ghost to whoever he desired to
[1:43:48] give the Holy Ghost to amen he truly did
[1:43:52] let's just pause right there just just
[1:43:54] just on that note Let's uh let's let's
[1:43:57] go turn over to the Book of
[1:44:04] Genesis just to make a little Point
[1:44:10] here sorry I said Genesis I meant
[1:44:17] Exodus Exodus chapter 31
[1:44:27] Pentecost was the pouring out of the
[1:44:30] spirit the
[1:44:31] acceptance of the spirit that was in
[1:44:34] Christ that was divided up at
[1:44:37] Calvary but he's God Amen and he can
[1:44:40] pour His Spirit out wherever he wants
[1:44:42] amen whenever he wants and he did in
[1:44:45] Exodus chapter 31 verse one says and the
[1:44:48] Lord spake unto Moses saying see I have
[1:44:50] called by name
[1:44:53] balil the son of URI the son of her of
[1:44:57] the tribe of Judah and I have filled him
[1:45:01] with the spirit of
[1:45:03] God in wisdom and in understanding and
[1:45:07] in knowledge and in all manner of
[1:45:09] workmanship to devise cunning Works to
[1:45:12] work in gold and in silver and in brass
[1:45:16] and in cutting of stones to set them in
[1:45:19] a carving of Timber to work in all
[1:45:21] manner of workmansh
[1:45:23] ship so just to point out he can pour
[1:45:27] His Spirit into anyone amen anytime
[1:45:31] anywhere amen we're not talking about
[1:45:34] necessarily having the the the baptism
[1:45:37] of the Holy Spirit according to
[1:45:38] Pentecost but it's still the same Spirit
[1:45:40] brothers and sisters there's no
[1:45:42] difference between the spirit we could
[1:45:45] say that it's one of the three persons
[1:45:47] but then we have three different
[1:45:49] personalities distinctly and that's not
[1:45:51] the way the word of God is written when
[1:45:53] we look at it it is Jesus Christ the
[1:45:56] Lord God himself he chose a human name
[1:46:00] and that human name is Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:03] amen we know that but he can pour His
[1:46:05] Spirit out on on anyone I'll just carry
[1:46:08] on with this quote here brother Bram he
[1:46:10] said they they would if they would have
[1:46:12] stayed with God they would have had that
[1:46:13] but they got away from God so they just
[1:46:15] weren't able to go into that that
[1:46:18] position and take that land back yet he
[1:46:21] goes on to say in 114 that's the way the
[1:46:23] organization is the church it's got a
[1:46:25] right to these things but but you have
[1:46:28] been cheated out of it because you got
[1:46:30] away from God's word and God's spirit
[1:46:32] anointing to uh vindicate the word of
[1:46:35] the Season he says don't you fail to get
[1:46:38] this messag and what it is that cheats
[1:46:41] us out of it it's where we would say
[1:46:44] that it's just fine to be baptized in
[1:46:46] the name of the father in the name of
[1:46:47] the son and in the name of the Holy
[1:46:49] Ghost what happens is we ground the
[1:46:52] power of God when we do that because the
[1:46:54] word of God says to be baptized in the
[1:46:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there
[1:46:59] is no disciple anywhere in the Bible in
[1:47:02] any Scripture that baptized in the name
[1:47:04] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:47:07] we can say anyone who's a father in this
[1:47:09] room just raise your hand there's many
[1:47:11] fathers any sons raise your hand many
[1:47:15] sons many Spirit Holy Spirit I'd hope
[1:47:19] everybody would raise their hand and say
[1:47:20] right here amen but not of those is a
[1:47:23] human name right and as soon as we get
[1:47:26] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:29] Christ what happens is Satan's power
[1:47:31] over us is rendered powerless and that's
[1:47:34] why he fights it so hard he doesn't want
[1:47:36] nothing to do with it that's the old
[1:47:39] time religion brothers and sisters where
[1:47:41] we truly get the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:43] Ghost when we get that baptism of the
[1:47:45] Holy Ghost Satan cannot touch us I don't
[1:47:48] think there's anything else that we
[1:47:49] could ever want to preach about in this
[1:47:51] age in which we live
[1:47:53] through that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:55] we've got healing through that baptism
[1:47:56] of the Holy Ghost we've got Deliverance
[1:47:59] my how many people need Deliverance
[1:48:01] there's many things that we could need
[1:48:02] Deliverance for here how many marriages
[1:48:04] need
[1:48:05] restoration through the baptism of the
[1:48:07] Holy Ghost we become new creatures in
[1:48:09] Christ Jesus we don't become new
[1:48:11] creatures in Christ Jesus because we
[1:48:13] read the Bible and join a church all we
[1:48:16] are is good church members that know our
[1:48:18] Bibles oh my but just get to know him
[1:48:21] one time go to that intimate place not
[1:48:24] just know him according to head
[1:48:26] knowledge like we talked about in the
[1:48:27] Bible that word know means an intimate
[1:48:30] relationship and when that intimate
[1:48:32] relationship happens what happens
[1:48:34] there's a life that starts to grow
[1:48:36] inside of the believer and that life can
[1:48:39] only be one person Jesus Christ the same
[1:48:42] yesterday today and forever he says
[1:48:44] that's the way the organization is the
[1:48:47] church it's got a right to these things
[1:48:50] everyone has a right to them but you've
[1:48:52] been sheated out of it because you got
[1:48:54] away from God's word you said it's just
[1:48:56] fine I know that I've been baptized and
[1:48:59] I don't need to go any other way oh my
[1:49:02] but God's spirit anointing to vindicate
[1:49:04] his word in this season is there for
[1:49:07] anyone that's willing to take him at his
[1:49:09] word amen amen and you know what I would
[1:49:11] say today I would say to anyone who
[1:49:13] maybe questions it or or maybe doesn't
[1:49:15] understand it just try it just try it
[1:49:17] and see if it's not real he says notice
[1:49:21] what taking place now he said I saw God
[1:49:24] Micaiah did Sitting upon the throne in
[1:49:27] heaven his counsil was gathered around
[1:49:29] him he said who can we get to go down
[1:49:32] and deceive Ahab can you imagine God
[1:49:34] saying these words who can we get to go
[1:49:38] deceive
[1:49:40] him to make Elijah's words come true
[1:49:44] amen because God's word will always come
[1:49:47] to pass amen amen and many people would
[1:49:50] say w it was just Elijah's word even the
[1:49:52] prophet here he says who's going to make
[1:49:53] Elijah's words come true it wasn't
[1:49:55] Elijah's words those were God's words
[1:49:57] through his
[1:50:00] Prophet that was Vindicated my Prophet
[1:50:03] that was Vindicated I spoke that he
[1:50:05] would come and Elijah had my word the
[1:50:09] heavens and the Earth will pass away but
[1:50:10] my word will not fail amen I love how he
[1:50:14] says this I don't care how modern they
[1:50:16] get or how good they get or how educated
[1:50:20] they get or how big they are my words
[1:50:24] will never fail amen you know brothers
[1:50:27] and sisters in trying to do God a
[1:50:29] service without it being his will
[1:50:31] brother brandham preaching he says they
[1:50:33] had all the religious motion when it was
[1:50:37] time for the ark to come back to
[1:50:39] Jerusalem when David said hey that Ark
[1:50:43] is supposed to come here it's very
[1:50:44] similar to what what what's going on
[1:50:47] here in our story today with Ahab and
[1:50:48] josaphat isn't it very similar he knew
[1:50:51] that Ark was supposed to be in Jerusalem
[1:50:54] that was the Ark of the Covenant it
[1:50:55] belonged to
[1:50:57] them but what did he do he just went
[1:50:59] about it just a little bit wrong that's
[1:51:01] right he was supposed to have Levites
[1:51:04] carry that Arc amen over their
[1:51:08] hearts and what happened they built a
[1:51:11] new they built a modern religion and
[1:51:14] said we're just going to drive this cart
[1:51:16] right into where it's supposed to be
[1:51:19] there's no modern religion that's going
[1:51:21] to do it and brother bam he says that
[1:51:22] they had all the religious motion you
[1:51:24] can imagine they had the best
[1:51:25] instruments they had the best musicians
[1:51:27] they had the best programs they had the
[1:51:29] best singers they had the best choirs
[1:51:33] they had the best priests they had the
[1:51:35] best clothes they had all the best food
[1:51:37] the sacrifices everything was in order
[1:51:40] except for one thing and a man lost his
[1:51:43] life for it I just can't help but think
[1:51:46] how many people will lose their
[1:51:48] spiritual life for not accepting the
[1:51:50] word of God for this day
[1:51:54] why I don't care how modern they get or
[1:51:56] how good they get or how educated they
[1:51:58] get or how big they are my words will
[1:52:02] never fail and a lying Spirit came up
[1:52:05] out of hell just like we heard last week
[1:52:09] There's the regions of the natural and
[1:52:12] then there's some areas below and
[1:52:14] there's some areas above but right out
[1:52:16] of the areas below this angel came up
[1:52:20] this lying Spirit came up out of hell
[1:52:22] fell down on his knees and said if
[1:52:24] you'll just permit me oh my if you'll
[1:52:26] just give me a CH give me a shot and
[1:52:29] I'll just go do it I I'll just go and be
[1:52:32] a lying spirit in the mouth of His
[1:52:34] prophets my if you'll just permit me I
[1:52:37] can give them my
[1:52:39] anointing My Lying
[1:52:42] anointing and make them do any kind of a
[1:52:45] sign or
[1:52:46] wonder oh my maybe speak in
[1:52:51] tongues maybe in
[1:52:53] interpret maybe lay hands on the sick
[1:52:55] and they'll
[1:52:56] recover any kind of a sign or wonder
[1:53:00] just as long as I get them off the
[1:53:05] word he won't even know that it's your
[1:53:09] word he'll ignore it brothers and
[1:53:13] sisters don't let us ignore it he'll
[1:53:16] ignore it for
[1:53:19] popularity brother times hasn't changed
[1:53:21] right this is 19 when is this
[1:53:26] 65 the anointed ones at the end time
[1:53:29] this is a powerful message here my just
[1:53:32] as long as I get him off the word he
[1:53:34] won't even know that it's your word
[1:53:35] he'll ignore it for
[1:53:37] popularity brother times hasn't changed
[1:53:40] brother Neville that's true you remember
[1:53:43] that's true I'll get upon him I I'll
[1:53:45] make him do the same things the rest of
[1:53:47] them does I I'll make them prophesy and
[1:53:50] tell a lie yeah
[1:53:53] how could it be a lie and this is where
[1:53:56] it becomes what we the world would call
[1:53:58] Gray excuse me you know if you have a
[1:54:01] business and you deal with
[1:54:04] accounting many people have to deal with
[1:54:06] accountants anyways but when you have a
[1:54:07] business and you're dealing with
[1:54:08] accounting and you have things that
[1:54:10] you'd like to write off where you
[1:54:12] actually get a little bit of a credit a
[1:54:14] tax break you don't have to pay tax on
[1:54:15] those items so much and the accountants
[1:54:18] we had one that said you know maybe you
[1:54:21] shouldn't write that off and maybe you
[1:54:22] could WR you did you think about it you
[1:54:24] could write that off and we would say
[1:54:25] something else and and they would say
[1:54:27] well that's you know you're kind of
[1:54:28] stepping into the gray area you know how
[1:54:31] how gray do you want to be is what the
[1:54:33] accountant would say to us and I just
[1:54:34] thought it was so good because it's it's
[1:54:36] either black or it's white some people
[1:54:39] would say I noticed it's awfully quiet
[1:54:41] here some people would say there are
[1:54:42] great areas according to taxes so that
[1:54:44] you can get the biggest benefit and
[1:54:46] there are sure but it depends on how
[1:54:48] gray you want to go if you want to get
[1:54:50] into the really really dark Grays that's
[1:54:51] where you're probably going to get
[1:54:52] audited and have problems and at the end
[1:54:55] of the day you just get a big whopping
[1:54:56] tax bill
[1:54:57] back but when we're talking about the
[1:54:59] word of God it's black or it's white
[1:55:01] there's no no gray areas right and
[1:55:05] that's the trick of the devil to say
[1:55:06] while the devil's in the details we can
[1:55:08] just discuss it and and argue it and
[1:55:10] we've been given you know the the
[1:55:12] theological understanding and by the way
[1:55:14] what school did you go to I didn't go to
[1:55:15] a school for for for for for the word of
[1:55:18] God alls I did was go to the School of
[1:55:20] Hard docks and and through that I out of
[1:55:22] my misery in the life that I lived I
[1:55:24] actually had somebody introduce me to
[1:55:26] the Living God and I'll tell you what
[1:55:29] that was all I needed he actually
[1:55:30] changed my life in such a way I know
[1:55:33] people from my past brother qua you
[1:55:35] would be able to attest to it we we
[1:55:37] don't live our lives now the way that we
[1:55:38] used to live our lives uh we're
[1:55:40] different people we're new creatures in
[1:55:42] Christ Jesus and that's what happens to
[1:55:44] us it's not just someone going and
[1:55:47] getting head knowledge and it's so
[1:55:49] important to remember it has to be a re
[1:55:52] ation in our lives we can learn a lot in
[1:55:55] our human capabilities but to actually
[1:55:58] have it revealed to us is a totally
[1:55:59] different thing brothers and sisters he
[1:56:02] says that's true I'll get upon him make
[1:56:04] him do the same things the rest of them
[1:56:06] does I'll make him prophesy and tell a
[1:56:07] lie how could it be a lie because it was
[1:56:10] contrary to the word you take any of
[1:56:13] these false baptisms false so and soul I
[1:56:17] don't care how real it sounds how much
[1:56:20] they try to impersonate
[1:56:23] it's a lie if it's contrary to God's
[1:56:26] word of this
[1:56:29] hour that's so strong but hey it's
[1:56:34] true it's a
[1:56:36] lie some people might say well maybe
[1:56:39] it's just a an error maybe it's just a
[1:56:42] uh misunderstanding I'll say this if it
[1:56:44] is an error or a misunderstanding and
[1:56:47] the word of God brings correction then
[1:56:50] we're going to line up with that word
[1:56:51] aren't we that's where it is then it's
[1:56:54] then it's actually just a
[1:56:55] misunderstanding that can be cleared up
[1:56:57] or or maybe an error but aside from that
[1:57:00] it becomes a lie when we say nope it's
[1:57:02] exactly where I stand and there's
[1:57:04] nothing that's going to change me it
[1:57:06] becomes a lie if it's contrary to God's
[1:57:08] word of this hour that's exactly you say
[1:57:11] well ours well we did this and we do
[1:57:14] this and our church is that way and that
[1:57:16] he says I don't care if it is I could
[1:57:18] just imagine the reason I'm saying is I
[1:57:19] could just imagine can't you imagine
[1:57:21] brother brandom being Micaiah standing
[1:57:23] there telling Ahab and Jehoshaphat I
[1:57:25] don't care what it is if it's contrary
[1:57:27] to the written word for this hour it's a
[1:57:30] lie
[1:57:32] amen all the ministerial associations
[1:57:35] going oo you're searing us now we got to
[1:57:37] close the doors on this guy this guy's
[1:57:39] out you're never going to live this down
[1:57:42] and we know that's what they did they
[1:57:43] slammed their doors on them but that
[1:57:44] didn't stop the word of God from coming
[1:57:46] to pass otherwise we wouldn't be
[1:57:48] preaching it here today amen I don't
[1:57:50] care what it is if it's contrary to the
[1:57:52] written word for this hour it's a lie
[1:57:55] God will have nothing to do with it no
[1:57:57] matter how sincere how educated how
[1:58:01] smart how true it sounds how reasonable
[1:58:04] it sounds think about 400 God prophets
[1:58:08] they probably sounded really reasonable
[1:58:10] they probably sounded really really
[1:58:13] sincere but it didn't matter did
[1:58:16] it
[1:58:18] my I don't care how reasonable it sounds
[1:58:20] if it's contrary to the word of this
[1:58:21] hour we'll get into that a little deeper
[1:58:23] in a few minutes if time permits us and
[1:58:26] time permits Us in this message if you
[1:58:27] ever listen to it he gets into it a
[1:58:29] little deeper my he says or we'll take
[1:58:32] it up tonight he says notice he was a
[1:58:34] sincere good man no doubt and he said
[1:58:36] then otherwise maah said to him not not
[1:58:40] not right out to his face but other
[1:58:42] words you're Anointed with a lying
[1:58:46] Spirit wouldn't that be something to
[1:58:48] tell a bishop but he done it and you
[1:58:51] know brothers and sisters unfortunately
[1:58:53] I just believe it we have to stand in
[1:58:55] our position today and say that anything
[1:58:57] contrary to this word Vindicated word of
[1:59:00] the hour is a lie amen you're Anointed
[1:59:04] with a lying
[1:59:06] Spirit we know that there's many
[1:59:08] different anointings in this world
[1:59:10] there's many different Spirits in this
[1:59:11] world but there's only one or the other
[1:59:15] it's God or Satan it's good or it's evil
[1:59:19] and what's Evil Brothers and Sisters
[1:59:20] many times we would think about evil
[1:59:22] being a a raging monster someone that's
[1:59:24] really bad doing really despicable
[1:59:27] things anything contrary to the word of
[1:59:29] God is evil
[1:59:32] amen why we were talking about it you
[1:59:36] know over Christmas and I think it's
[1:59:37] important to mention even you can have
[1:59:40] evil
[1:59:43] parents you can have parents that aren't
[1:59:45] willing to actually uphold the word of
[1:59:47] God to the standard in which it should
[1:59:49] be held and you know what those parents
[1:59:52] are
[1:59:53] evil and what happens is they think
[1:59:55] they're shielding their children
[1:59:56] protecting them from maybe some things
[1:59:59] that they just don't like the parents
[2:00:00] don't like it's really hard and it's
[2:00:02] really difficult to do and it causes
[2:00:04] upset but it's either good or it's
[2:00:07] evil and it's important for us as
[2:00:09] parents to recognize we don't want to be
[2:00:11] evil amen it's not about going out and
[2:00:14] and doing despicable things it's just
[2:00:17] about actually omitting just just a tiny
[2:00:19] little bit of the word of God just
[2:00:21] leaving a little bit out that part
[2:00:22] that's really uncomfortable in our lives
[2:00:24] that's
[2:00:25] evil we could be Anointed with a lying
[2:00:28] spirit and we wouldn't want that for our
[2:00:30] families Would
[2:00:32] we not one bit not one
[2:00:36] bit he goes on to say and so this bishop
[2:00:39] walked up and said he'll never have
[2:00:43] Fellowship no more your ministry is
[2:00:45] finished you're
[2:00:48] over and what did he do he smacked him
[2:00:51] in the face and I just can't help but
[2:00:52] think brothers and sisters when the time
[2:00:54] comes where we talked about a little bit
[2:00:56] earlier that there will be an accounting
[2:00:58] given of this day what will happen is
[2:01:00] when when this this bishop he sees the
[2:01:03] man that he slapped when he looks back
[2:01:05] at him he's going to see the face of
[2:01:07] Jesus Amen he's not going to see the
[2:01:10] prophet he's going to recognize what he
[2:01:12] did cuz he wasn't slapping the prophet
[2:01:14] in the face even though the prophet had
[2:01:16] to Bear the stripes for it he was
[2:01:18] slapping God in the face amen yes he was
[2:01:22] you'll never have Fellowship no more and
[2:01:23] smacked him in the face said you know
[2:01:25] that I'm a Vindicated man he was the one
[2:01:28] that liked to be polish remember my
[2:01:30] church made me the head of it this thing
[2:01:32] the popular vote of God's people made me
[2:01:34] this my organization made me this and
[2:01:37] God gave us this land and he intends for
[2:01:39] it to belong to us and I have thus
[2:01:42] sayith the Lord amen oh my smacked him
[2:01:45] and said which way the spirit of God go
[2:01:47] when it left me I better call the
[2:01:50] musicians I can see where getting to to
[2:01:53] close in time here he goes on to say
[2:01:55] Micaiah said you'll find out one of
[2:01:57] these days this is what we talked about
[2:01:59] a little bit earlier the Vindicated
[2:02:00] Prophet that prophesied things in the
[2:02:02] day in which we live he says you'll find
[2:02:04] out one of these days when California is
[2:02:06] Beneath the Sea out yonder and all these
[2:02:09] things see you'll see which way it went
[2:02:11] when you're sitting in the inner prisons
[2:02:13] when you say wow God really did send a
[2:02:16] prophet and wow all of those Visions in
[2:02:19] 1933 that we just read about on
[2:02:21] Wednesday night
[2:02:22] all of those Visions have been fulfilled
[2:02:24] wow we'll be wishing that maybe we got
[2:02:27] in line with it now Ahab what are you
[2:02:30] going to say I believe my prophet he
[2:02:34] said what if he just searched the word
[2:02:36] see he didn't he didn't want to see
[2:02:38] himself cursed hear me he didn't want to
[2:02:41] see himself cursed no man does nobody
[2:02:45] wants to see themselves
[2:02:47] cursed and my organizational brother
[2:02:50] that's what's the matter with with you
[2:02:52] you want to think that you're right when
[2:02:56] you know your heart when you're baptized
[2:02:59] using the name of father son Holy Ghost
[2:03:02] you're not just
[2:03:04] wrong you're lying amen and you know
[2:03:08] brothers and sisters I just want to say
[2:03:09] it this way if that sounds really harsh
[2:03:11] and sharp we can be anointed by a lying
[2:03:15] spirit it's possible that's what 400 God
[2:03:19] prophets had aying Spirit anointing them
[2:03:23] we can have that we're
[2:03:24] humans how many here has ever told a lie
[2:03:28] raise your hand go on I want to see it
[2:03:30] how many people's ever told a lie
[2:03:31] there's some that's never told a lie God
[2:03:34] bless
[2:03:35] you but for everyone else that's ever
[2:03:38] told a lie and was honest about
[2:03:41] it you've been anointed by a lying
[2:03:44] Spirit that's what's
[2:03:46] happened but somewhere along the way
[2:03:48] correction came right and as believers
[2:03:51] willing to say just be it unto me Lord
[2:03:53] just correct me put me on the potter's
[2:03:55] wheel let let me be shapen by your hands
[2:03:57] let me be just broken to pieces and then
[2:04:00] put back together the way that you want
[2:04:01] me to be put together and that's the way
[2:04:03] it's got to be in our minds sometimes
[2:04:05] people think that people are losing
[2:04:07] control when they get the baptism of the
[2:04:09] Holy Ghost if you ever listen to those
[2:04:10] messages at the ends of those messages
[2:04:13] people start screaming and losing it and
[2:04:15] brother bradam says there it is yes
[2:04:19] there it is let him go ask God for what
[2:04:22] you want because he's here right
[2:04:25] now Hallelujah he doesn't want to see us
[2:04:28] stuck under an anointing of a lying
[2:04:32] Spirit you
[2:04:34] know you say those things that you're
[2:04:37] doing and take initial evidences and all
[2:04:40] things like that you're wrong how can
[2:04:42] the initial evidence be speaking in
[2:04:44] tongues and then talk contrary to a
[2:04:46] promise of God in this hour how can it
[2:04:48] be you don't want the curse do you but
[2:04:52] here it's written so shall it be that's
[2:04:55] the mark of the beast or so close that
[2:04:57] it would deceive the elected if it were
[2:04:59] possible every sign every Wonder
[2:05:00] anointed man prophecy all kind of things
[2:05:03] going forth all kinds of signs and kinds
[2:05:05] of Wonders how you going to tell the
[2:05:09] difference watch the word for this hour
[2:05:14] amen imagine if the people in Noah's day
[2:05:19] didn't watch the word for that hour
[2:05:22] and you know you can only imagine that
[2:05:24] the people in that day didn't watch the
[2:05:26] word for their hour or if they did maybe
[2:05:29] they watched it and they mocked it as
[2:05:32] the word for their hour was manifest
[2:05:34] before them and and what happened was
[2:05:36] there was only eight Souls that were
[2:05:38] saved seven of them were the ones that
[2:05:40] were closest to Noah but they watched
[2:05:43] the word of the hour and they were able
[2:05:45] to be saved and we know that was just
[2:05:47] one word for one
[2:05:49] hour every single hour hour we're not
[2:05:52] talking about hours and minutes we're
[2:05:53] talking about spaces of time throughout
[2:05:56] history right every hour has a word for
[2:06:01] it and we know there's seven Church ages
[2:06:04] and I would say maybe there's seven
[2:06:05] hours we could word it that way but
[2:06:08] every single one of those hours has a
[2:06:11] word for it and we can choose to accept
[2:06:13] what God's Prophet chooses even though
[2:06:15] it's a contrary word to all of the other
[2:06:18] popular opinion am or we can line up
[2:06:20] with it and say wait a second I can see
[2:06:22] it in God's word God's word says that
[2:06:25] God's word says
[2:06:28] that he says watch Moses how he could
[2:06:31] have told
[2:06:33] balum watch Micaiah here maybe stand
[2:06:35] with me as we close how do we know he
[2:06:38] was right the word before him had
[2:06:41] prophesied that for Ahab I think this is
[2:06:45] just powerful brothers and sisters the
[2:06:47] word before him prophesied that this was
[2:06:50] going to happen
[2:06:52] Elijah the prophet said because of what
[2:06:55] you've done the dogs will lick your
[2:06:57] blood and that's what happened that's
[2:06:59] how it turned out for him in his day the
[2:07:02] prophet spoke the word and it had to
[2:07:04] come to pass the prophet didn't speak
[2:07:06] his own word the prophet spoke the word
[2:07:08] of God he was the mouthpiece for God and
[2:07:11] because of that this other fell came
[2:07:14] along we know that he wasn't a m what we
[2:07:16] call a major prophet he's a minor
[2:07:18] Prophet but he had the prophetic gift he
[2:07:19] uttered prophetically
[2:07:22] and God spoke and it had to come to pass
[2:07:25] exactly because you know it's so
[2:07:26] beautiful isn't it he spoke what was
[2:07:29] already spoken amen he didn't come up
[2:07:31] with a new word and if you take a look
[2:07:34] at the prophet for our day the word for
[2:07:36] our hour he only preached what was
[2:07:38] already
[2:07:40] preached boy I could just go on and on
[2:07:43] I'm so sorry I
[2:07:45] just I just think it's so beautiful to
[2:07:48] see the word of God in the day in which
[2:07:50] we live to have the Revelation it only
[2:07:52] comes by Revelation and when we have
[2:07:54] that Revelation the only thing that we
[2:07:56] want to do is humble ourselves to the
[2:07:59] word amen it's so beautiful Hallelujah
[2:08:02] God bless you today amen let's pray
[2:08:05] Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you
[2:08:08] for your gift of Revelation Lord thank
[2:08:11] you for your gift of of of Prophecy for
[2:08:14] us in the day in which we live
[2:08:16] Lord thank you Father for the ability to
[2:08:19] align ourselves up with that word for
[2:08:22] our day yes Lord we know that many
[2:08:25] people cannot and we know that even in
[2:08:27] your word the story that we read today

[2:08:32] wouldn't so many people that just
[2:08:35] couldn't but we know father your word
[2:08:38] will never ever return to you void oh

[2:08:47] just respond to your word as we close
[2:08:49] out this year as this year year comes to

[2:08:53] look back in our lives and and examine
[2:08:56] ourselves and say are we the same people

[2:09:00] year father if there's one one prayer
[2:09:03] that I have for everyone it would be

[2:09:10] and and and get fit and do all these
[2:09:12] other things Lord help us to let your
[2:09:15] mind be in us that's my prayer father
[2:09:18] that Lord Jesus we would desire to align
[2:09:20] ourselves greater with your word than
[2:09:23] ever before in our lives Lord that we
[2:09:26] would see spiritual growth when we look
[2:09:28] back on our lives should you T at the
[2:09:31] end of 2025 that we would be able to say

[2:09:39] you brought me through them all Lord and
[2:09:41] I know that I have more growth in my
[2:09:44] life than I had when I went into
