========================================

spirit and then take it to the word and the message of the hour and confirm it by the word and by the message of the hour then you know what will happen it will actually come to life in the individual it should start to come to life it should do something to you it should do something to us it should cause a stimulation by that Revelation to know that it's it's not just my idea it's not just my thought it's not just something somebody told me somewhere along the way it's something that God showed me sovereignly he showed me by the spirit he confirmed it by the word so then what brother Branham says it needs to manifest in the life of the individual once that happens once that stimulation happens it changes something in US it changes our walk it changes our talk our habits disappear the Devils that had control over our lives no longer have control because there's a there's a stimulation of the Revelation that's happened to us and that's I believe where it starts for a True Believer that's that's our starting place with the message of the hour that's where we have the ability yes that Mighty angel that descended in Revelations 10 7 has already descended he's not going to descend he already has there's going to be an Ascension that's what's going to happen many people are singing songs today asking crying out praying for the coming of the Lord and it's already happened That's History it's going to be the going of the way the next coming of the Lord is in Revelations 19 and that's where we all come back with him we need to make sure that we understand exactly where we are in time so I want to say it again what's in your hand what's in our hand we're going to get into this a little further in this in this message brother Branham he tells the story and and this is where the book really isn't open and and this is where we can get our traditions and and our our teachings and and maybe some of the things that we've gone through in our lives can really stunt our our ability our growth and and and and physically and spiritually and mentally all these things can happen depending on circumstances around us but we don't want to do that brother Brandon tell us this story about this Mom who gets pneumonia in this message she gets pneumonia and her son is off at theology school he's off at the at the Bible College studying and getting trained in the ways of the word and and while he's away he's being taught that Mark 16 and action is only good up until the ninth verse and everything from the ninth verse on is uninspired is what he's taught in his theological studies and this boy believes that with all his heart and his mom she gets sick and and they had the holy rollers in the mission Down on the Corner probably a little church like ours I can't help but think it must be similar to that or it must have been but they have this little church and and and the mom couldn't be treated for her pneumonia she was an elderly woman and she couldn't be treated because she couldn't take penicillin I think she was allergic to it or something and and so what happens was her friend says hey you know what we we see miracles in our church we have a living God in our church and you know if the doctors can't help you I think my pastor might be able to why don't you just maybe let him pray for you would you would you mind letting him try to pray for you imagine that hey a friend just wanting to reach out and help a friend and what I like about this story is that brother Brown doesn't say that she went and joined the church he doesn't say that she signed up and became a member of it all she did was say hey okay sure I'll try you I'll try out I'll take you up on that offer and so she goes down and she gets prayed for and she gets healed she gets healed in the name of Jesus that's wonderful son comes home from school and and and you know sometime later goes by mom and son are having a conversation the son says oh yeah Mom didn't you have pneumonia while I was away remember I was going to come home and and see you I thought it was an emergency situation and and and you had pneumonia how did the doctors treat you and she says oh son the doctors couldn't treat me they never treated me God treated me I went and got prayed for down at the mission and he says oh Mom you didn't do that you didn't go down there with those people and get prayed for oh yeah I did and I got healed God healed me oh no Mom that's not possible the days of Miracles has passed and how this son the book just isn't open to them he wound up getting some tradition some some Creed some some some traditional teaching some ideology from someone else instead of just taking the word and letting God reveal it by the spirit to him which is what the Walk of a True Believer truly is but the son says oh it must have been a doctor's Mom it couldn't have been couldn't have been God because the days of Miracles has passed and what a simple little story hey but I just love the ending of it because you know what what the mom says the the son says oh no you know Mark 16 the the beyond the ninth verse is uninspired and the mom says oh Hallelujah glory and she starts to have a little Rejoice there in the moment and he says mom you're sounding like those people down there calm down you don't want to go that way and and he says what's wrong with you and she says my goodness if an uninspired word will heal my body what will an inspired word do so brothers and sisters tonight that's why I'm so excited I just I don't know if it shows but I feel it I feel inspired tonight to think that the whole world is dealing with an uninspired word not having the true baptism of the Holy Ghost not realizing Mark 16 in action not seeing Revelations 10 7 that Mighty Angel descending with an open book in his hand with all of our names written in it and here we stand tonight as the Bride of Jesus Christ what's in our hands what's in our hands Mark 16 in action is his true church that he calls his own and all else is false you know I just I just love the words to that song that we sang tonight Standing on the Promises that cannot fail [Music] when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail by The Living Word of God what I shall Prevail Glory Standing on the Promises of God [Music] so tonight we're going to talk about the children of Israel we're going to talk about them in the Old Testament and all of the natural examples but while we go through and we talk about these natural examples I want to just take it and fast forward thousands of years to today in our lives we don't deal with the natural examples like we're talking about we deal with Devils we're just going to call it out right now tonight make it plain black and white we're talking about devils doctrines of devils devils that come around and afflict our bodies Devils that afflict our minds Devils that afflict our marriages Devils that afflict our our businesses Devils that just do everything to try and throw banana peels in our life we're talking about Devils tonight but the children of Israel they dealt with the natural enemy so as we go through these I just want to remember that we're talking about Devils think about all the things that we contend within our lives we heard about it on Sunday so good brother Toby thank you brother talking about the the promises of God and and the sermon title that he had the expression of God's grace throughout all the ages and and here we stand tonight as God's grace to all the ages we were talking about it this morning on on a phone call and how really seriously every day it just gets stronger and stronger for me to think about how when we get over there we're gonna say how did you guys make it how did you stand how did you get burned at the stake how did you get fed to Lions how how could you have done that and they're going to say how did you contend with all the Devils of laodicea how did you withstand all of that we're gonna say we didn't there is only one set of footprints in the sand through our lives and it was him carrying us remember in the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 1 verse 3 every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses so I'm just going to paraphrase it here every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto brother Branham every single promise he was here to be an example for what we are supposed to come to he's not an office to be worshiped he was in office to take out a bride of Christ's own choosing you know some people in the days of Eliezer they just wanted to stay with the gifts they just loved that Camel full the camel's full of all the gifts they didn't want the giver but you know there was one she wanted to give her she wanted to go and see her Isaac she wanted to go all the way she didn't care about all the gold and the silver and the moment and all the Pomp and everything that went along with it she wasn't into that but every place at the soul of your foot shall tread upon brothers and sisters that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses only be thou strong and very courageous are the instructions don't fear don't be afraid God can't use a coward as what brother Bradham said we don't want to be afraid we don't want to be cowards and I know I'm guilty myself I'll tell you I've just given in to the devil given into whatever it is oh I'm afraid I can't overcome the temptation's too strong it's too great for me no no no no no no no tonight we're here to serve notice to the devil what's in your hand you know what's in our hand brothers and sisters not a closed book but an open book and every single promise in this book is mine and we've got to be willing to say that and we've got to be willing to say to Satan take a look buddy every promise in this book is mine and you can't stop this book from coming to pass in my life not worrying about anybody else I'm only going to talk about me tonight my life you know what Samson the story of Samson he had quite a few quite a few things in his life let's just quickly turn over to Judges chapter 15. Judges chapter 15. we'll just read a few stories tonight and just do a little preaching tonight and just see if the Lord will speak to us tonight Judges chapter 15 verse 12. it's amazing when you look at this keep in mind what's in your hand keep in mind the trespassing enemy and sometimes what our brothers and our sisters can be like goodness in chapter 15 verse 12 so these this is this is the the three thousand we'll start with verse 11. actually 10. sorry let's get excited judges 15 verse 10 and the men of Judah said why are you come up against us so these are the Philistines now that are come up to Judah and they answered to bind Samson to bind Samson or we come up to do him do to him as he hath done to us so he just hung a weapon on him he just hung a real good weapon on the Philistines and they didn't want any part of them I mean they wanted every part of him they want to get him so verse 11 then 3 000 men of Judah not the Philistines three thousand men of Judah his brothers went to the Top of the Rock etam and said to Samson knowest thou not the Philistines are rulers over us so here they are in their Promised Land and they're saying to this man of God who's anointed don't you know that the enemy they're they're rulers we need to make Provisions so we don't upset the enemy that's got a hold in our lives a hold in our Promised Land can you imagine that but that's the way it was no doubt the Philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou has done to us you bring the reproach to us you're turning into a Holy Roller you're preaching a little too strong a little too loud the book's a little too open and he said unto them as they did unto me so have I done unto them they messed with me I mess with them can you imagine we need to have a testimony like that we got Devils messing with us let's mess with them let's not step back and say oh I'm being Afflicted let's stand forward and puff our chest out and say no I defy you in the name of the Living God you have no power over me Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ get lost and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee his brothers we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines just so we don't get Afflicted anymore just so they don't come against us anymore because they got rule over us we got to make sure that we've got keep the peace here right make it make it comfortable for that devil and Samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves just just pass me off then and and we'll go our way and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from The Rock and when he came unto Lehi the Philistines shouted against him imagine this the Devils got upset because they saw him coming and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became his flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loose from off his hands and he found a new Jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men there with and Samson said with a Jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men so we're talking naturally about the natural men but remember brothers and sisters what's in your hand is the book open to you have you been called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight are you actually living in the promised land where every place the soul of your foot Treads when you read in the Bible you see Jesus Christ and it speaks to you individually can you imagine that though his brothers came and said no we got to keep the peace don't want to get the occupiers upset it's amazing to think about this trespassing enemy when they show when they saw him they just began to cry out and it's just exactly what happened in Jesus life the most religious people they couldn't see it but the Devils the Devils they were able to see the Lord Jesus Christ and you know when I look around and see the problems rising up in the lives of individuals who are believers I can't help but think that the devils are shouting howling because they can see the Lord Jesus Christ and flesh again and they're going to do everything they can to try and distract us from seeing that we truly are the Living God in flesh Walking On Earth as long as we can get caught up in the in in in the moment with the occupiers there and look at the problems and and forget about what's in our hand and just be in the moment and and so busy and and and just totally consumed with everything that's going on in life we're going to miss what our responsibility is and I believe our responsibility is to stand tall and not be afraid the song We sang Standing on the Promises that cannot fail his promises cannot fail in the lives of a Believer but Satan wants us to believe they do Satan wants us to look at so and so and such and such and say well they got prayed for and look at them and and and they got prayed for in that circumstance and look at that but you know what we're not talking about having a prosperous life here what we're talking about is actually making it to the throne making it to the throne making it to our Eternal destination that's what we're fighting for brothers and sisters our Promised Land is Our Eternal destination it's not living here in this earth and saying that I've got a nice piece of land or or I'm going to have the healthiest body and I'm going to have all the vitamins and do all the things so I can have the longest life you know take this whole world but give me Jesus [Music] we don't want to get comfortable in this world the more that we're in this world the more we become of this world it's just the way it works humanly speaking we don't want more of this world I don't want more of this world anyways maybe I stand corrected that's maybe just my opinion and I apologize if it is but the longer I'm in this world the more disgusted I get just when you think you've heard it all there's more and I'm sure everyone has seen stuff recently it's just it's crazy but when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail by The Living Word of God I shall prevail I wonder if we could just sing this song as we go forwards this week just even this verse just just we're Standing on the Promises that cannot fail and when these Storms Come Around that try and assail by The Living Word of God how does the word of God live brothers and sisters it's spoken on the lips of Sons and Daughters of God it's the Living Word of God it's not an association to a church group no way it's it's it's being able to understand what's in our hand and taking it with a strong hand of Faith to the heart of the enemy not tolerating the devil not saying no I'm just going to say well you know I guess I've got it and I'll just accept it and I'll just move on no that's not what he wants he wants us to actually confess it brother Bradham says God can't do nothing for us unless we first confess it can you imagine that we need to be willing to speak the word I just love this part in uh the story of of Samson and how the spirit of God came mightily upon him and the cords burned like flax off of his wrists I just can't help but think it brothers and sisters there is a time in every single believer's life where the bonds that bind you will burn and fall like burnt flax off of your hands where you become released from your bondage where you become released from all of your fears and all of the trials that assail you the things that you thought you couldn't overcome you will overcome even brother Branham he said he fought his whole entire life with his body but at the very end God told him your enemy is dead on the wings of a snow white dove listen to that message and that little that little weasel looking thing that attacked him continually in his stomach praying for sick people to be healed when he was so sick he could hardly stand up think about how we all have have trials and and we all have things in our lives that we contend with every one of us does I think that maybe I just can say myself I have made provision for those things to be life maybe just a little longer than they need to be and I don't know maybe I just got a revelation and then maybe I got it confirmed by the word and now I'm seeing it manifest in my life where we don't have to tolerate Satan brothers and sisters we don't have to but just to think that something as simple as a job owner of a mule you could thrash a thousand Philistines with brother Branham says with helmets an inch thick it's just you can't even really comprehend it and then afterwards he says Lord you would let me go through all of this and I I I I kill a thousand men and I'm so so thirsty now after this and you would let me die of thirst and what does God do he pours water out of that Jawbone he looks after his own it's amazing turn over to Samuel first Samuel let's talk a little bit about David some real familiar scripture tonight nothing really extraordinary but I think it's all Extraordinary all of it is because it's all inspired I think we should be able to just say it say it again just tell me again tell me more say it again first Samuel chapter 17. you know David and and the Giant start with verse 45. then said David to the philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and will take thine head from thee and will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the Earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel [Music] brothers and sisters this this scripture is written for a purpose it's written to show us that we can do the same how do we do the same submit to the word you know what we can get so caught up in our lives so completely balled down balled up in all of the events in our lives maybe we just need to take everything that we've got going on in our lives and set it aside and just press pause and just say Lord I don't even know what to do anymore I'm so busy and so caught up and everything is so crazy think about how the children of Israel were there the most Valiant men in Israel assembled together in a battle with the Philistines and and here this giant comes out and now everyone's scared and I don't know if you've ever experienced it before but when I was a kid this is so silly to say even but when I was a kid I got caught up at a situation where it was just hysteria that this one kid that I I ran with he was really afraid of this other kid and so he would talk about this other kid and how he was really tough and he would beat up anybody and he could beat up big guys and and and he's he's he's got our names and he wants to beat us up now and and he never said that to me I never heard him say that but I heard this other kid say it and because I heard this other kid say it over and over and over and over and over I started to believe it and I got to the place where I was scared of this kid that he's gonna beat me up when he wasn't ever going to beat me up or maybe he would have but I just never had the opportunity to be around him or whatever but what a silly thing but for a kid it was real and for children of God it's a real thing when a devil comes around and starts boasting to say that you've got cancer or to say that you've got some terminal disease or to say that you can't overcome you're just going to stay on that that cycle of iniquity forever you're never going to overcome you know what brothers and sisters you are going to overcome the word says that they did overcome by the blood of the lamb and by their testimony of Jesus Christ we just have to be willing to apply the word and say you know there's a time where we just have to say no enough is enough is enough you are a trespasser Satan you are no longer welcome in this Promised Land because every single one of us if we are true Christians you are the promised land today the Holy Ghost in you is the promised land today and Satan's going to come around and try and squat all over that as a trespasser and make you think that you're not in the promised land while he is trespassing he's a trespasser he's not allowed to be there if we take that case and plead it before the most high God the Supreme deity the judge the white wigged one guess what he'll say pardoned doesn't matter what you try and bring against these these children of mine because I don't look at their flesh the way they're built here on Earth I only hear their voice the way that I created them before the foundation of the world because they've got a perfect body right here and and that's the way I see them but Satan gets us all caught up and seeing ourselves and seeing each other and dealing with all the emotional garbage that we do it's the devil let's call them out tonight Brothers and Sisters Let's Get Liberty in our lives let's have that Liberty that just takes us to the next level where we can recognize that we are Sons and Daughters of God and when we see Satan come in and around us in our family or or in our business or or in our jobs or whatever it is with our parents or our spouses or wherever Satan comes in let's call them out let's rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and say you're trespassing you have no authority to be here I have all the authority because I have a open book in my hand I have received the message of the hour I have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's not just some nebulous thing that is actually the literal life of Jesus Christ in my flesh so that when I speak God speaks and the Devils know it the Devils know it but this that this giant here this devil here this giant here this devil here he was trespassing you know everybody there knew it right all the children of Israel and all the Philistines they all knew that he was they were all trespassing this was the promised land and they thought that they could just come in and start making their boast the whole Army of God the Living God trembled because they heard this guy boasting and they were afraid of it they were afraid of the boasting like I was telling of that story when I was a kid just hysteria hearing hearing hearing hearing what we hear is what we become what we take into our bodies is what we become you know lot vexed his righteous Soul every single day with the things that he saw and heard is what the word says we've got to be very careful what we hear and what we see the whole Army of God was trembling in fear you know all it took was one inspired little boy isn't that just amazing when you think about that that's how God rolls that's how he is that's who he is he's not going to take the great man that's Head and Shoulders above everyone that's the best looking out of everyone that's the most fit that can run the fastest that has the most money who's the smartest most educated he's going to take a ruddy little Mama's Little is what brother Branham calls Samson anyways but David of someone ready just a little boy but he knew that he was anointed the prophet anointed him you know I'll go this far maybe I'm being a little bit bold tonight but I just feel good I feel inspired brothers and sisters I would say this just like David knew that he was anointed if you truly are a son and daughter of God and you truly have received the message of the hour then you truly have been anointed by the prophet for your day to be Kings and Priests not to be slapped around by the devil not to be taken hostage in prisoner and feel bound and and and and and hold them no no way he's a trespasser we have authority and you know the beautiful part is there's people out there in the denominational world that will just completely uh not talk about the prophet they'll take all the content from the prophet but they won't talk about the profit they won't give credit where credit's due but they'll say that we have all the authority they'll speak all the authority into existence because they know it's there and they'll get results from it but you know what it will only do them so much because they won't have the wedding garment they'll get in through a window somewhere and they'll be on the other side and and they'll be speechless just be speechless you'll say friend how'd you get in here you didn't come the provided way the way that I provided for you and your age or you'd have a wedding garment on you know David when he got inspired he got inspired didn't he he had a revelation by the spirit and then it was confirmed by the word because he was anointed and and to to realize the Revelation here we've got this devil trespassing in the Promised Land where every place the soul of your foot shall tread is yours is what the old Old Testament said the book of Moses said and David knew that so Saul tried to teach him when he got inspired he said no I'll teach you how you know we know that he's he's he's a Warrior from his Youth and you're only a youth you better take my stuff excuse me I love how brother Branham takes it and says you know take take my my theology to take my credentials down with you and and he just can't even lift it and that's what the word says his shield and his sword Saul's shield and sword were just too heavy for him he's like I can't do that I have to go with the Revelation that God's given me you know as I was pondering this I just couldn't help but think isn't it wonderful that God gives us trials in our lives because when he gives us trials in our lives it gives us the ability to see that he is a living God because we overcome our trials if we're living here tonight right now able to be a part of this service or even listen to it in a recording later or or stream it or whatever it is if we're alive and we have breath in our lungs we've had trials we've been sick in our bodies and we've been healed he's met our needs in our lives so many times but David he said I can't do it the way you want me to Saul don't don't don't worry about it I've got a revelation and I'm just going to go my way here you know what one time when I was tending my father sheep a lion came in and stole one and when that lion came in and tried to steal it what does the word say he did he grabbed it by the beard can you imagine that take it and think about it brothers and sisters that's a devil that came in to try and steal one of his father's sheep he grabbed it by the beard and flew it killed it and took the Sheep back and said no way you can't have any of them another time another example he actually must have been given given Saul this testimony service there in the midst of it all of the the Warriors the Valiant men the children of Israel listening to this testimony service that's why testimony services are powerful it puts the Devils on alert they're listening and when they start to hear someone rise up and give example of example of example of God delivering them again and again and again and and to hear him say another time a bear came in and stole one of my father's sheep and I went after him and I slew him too I don't need anything that you've got I've got a real Revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ brothers and sisters if we've got a real Revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ we have the ability to go and apply that in our own lives because it gets confirmed by the word every time we go to church every time we listen to the message of the hour every time we read the Bible every time we go on our knees and pray then we just need to let it manifest we just need to act we just need to go forwards and speak the words because we have the open word in our hands we have the word in our hands so just remember brothers and sisters those those words the question what's in your hands I don't know if sometimes we recognize the power that we have the authorities that we have who we really are we know that brother Bradham says when the church recognizes what it is then the Rapture will go and that's why I just felt so inspired to go this way tonight to talk about it what's in our hands brothers and sisters it's the pearl of great price it's the entirety of all the ages the culmination of all the ages the message of the hour the open book oh that the the prophets of all desired to look on it's just right here it's just about common for us we can just press play anytime and hear what Daniel desired to see it's amazing to look at so David he said to him I don't need your stuff I don't need your your equipment I don't need your theology I don't need your Revelation I've got mine it was revealed to me by the spirit and it was confirmed to me by the word by the prophet for my day and and now I'm going to go my way according to that Revelation and all's I need is this little sling with the five stones of Faith right and he went down there and he said you know what today you're going to die today I'm going to cut your head off devil you have no more power you have no more authority over me you have no more authority over my family you have no more authority over my church you have no more authority over any one of us because today I take your head off and I show you in the sight of all creation there is a living God and you know brothers and sisters remember that scripture it just came to me when I was studying this that all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God I believe this was an example of all creation seeing a witness of a true Son of God you know that brother Branham said the word says it even that David was a man after God's Own Heart the one who was a liar he committed adultery he murdered so that he could commit adultery but he was a man after God's Own Heart can you imagine that I'm sure we all have but he was the guy that said I don't need anything that you've got the ideas that you've got everything that you're doing is obviously not working he's still down there boasting so just step aside and let me go down there and I'll deal with this problem to show you guys there is really a living God in Israel and by that Revelation that's what he did and I believe it brothers and sisters as we go forwards in our lives we have the ability to do this this is not something that I'm trying to just do a pep rally and and encourage you although I want to try and encourage everyone's level of Faith to rise to the place where we don't have to tolerate Satan in our lives at any level we are more than Overcomers we are more than conquerors the Bride of Jesus Christ full Authority and Power but think about how how quacked David must have looked to everyone because he was completely out of order from the way all the people were going everyone was going this way it was all happening the way it was supposed to the tradition and everything was fine but we have this devil down here and we just don't know what to do with it but isn't it amazing God always sends a deliverer he always sends someone gives someone a burst of Faith to just go and actually create a testimony and when that happens then it creates more faith in other people David knew that he was anointed to be king and we know that that devil giant said what am I a dog that you would send a boy out to kill me you would send a boy out to challenge me but David said how dare you how dare you come against a son of God I just believe with all my heart tonight brothers and sisters I say that I just say it it's amazing how my ears are starting to ring right now as I say these words how dare Satan come against a son or a daughter of God can you imagine how bold that is for Satan to do that remember Revelations 20 verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast alive into a burning Lake of Fire that's his future David said how dare you come against the Son of God today I will destroy you in front of everyone all these people that are witnessing you trespassing will now witness you die we have the ability brothers and sisters and we know that in that moment it wasn't David speaking that wasn't David that was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking through David that all the Earth may know that there is a bride and that there is a God a Living Word inside his bride and by all of this this entire assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with spear sword for the battle is the Lord's just to think about that he will take the enemy and put them into your hand this isn't exclusive to David this is an example for the True Believer I believe it and and really just a quick example out of the message is pick up your pen and write but I feel like some people are afraid of it some people are afraid of that statement that whole entire part of the message to pick up your pen and write like it's going to be out there somewhere in the future or maybe we just can't grasp what that actually is saying but I just I would just like to encourage everyone read that pick up your pen and write what the spirit says to the prophet for our day I know some people will say well if they don't have thus Faith the Lord they keep still but the prophet says before that she has thus saith the Lord so what are we afraid of when Satan comes knocking on our door and tries to give us a box of rattlesnakes what do we do with it I was talking to brother Henry about this we can peek Inside the Box we could get bit don't even Peak Brothers and Sisters if it's a box of rattlesnakes give it back just give it back pick up your pen and write we have the ability to speak the word brothers and sisters there's coming a Time where that door is going to close we know in Noah's day when everything was finished brother Bradham says invisible uni the bride when they were standing at the bottom of that Glacier looking for that Glacier of fire the man beside him he actually voiced all things are ready Let the Fire Fall it's an amazing little part of that message I don't know if you're familiar with it but if you hear them say it the way he talks it's almost like he's talking about something going to happen but a voice beside him says that you know in Noah's day they got into the ark at the command of God and it wasn't Noah that closed that door in Esther's day there was a proclamation that went out for all the Jews to be destroyed the Devils just working their wisdom trying to get all the Jews to be destroyed but you know the story we'll dig into it later but just you know I couldn't help but think about it that that in Hell back then there must have been a staff meeting they must have had a real good staff meeting that they just need to destroy all the Jews and then they'll stop that that that that root of David from coming they'll stop that from ever happening and and there will never be that perfect sacrifice that will happen if they just could exterminate all the Jews right but there was a new prophecy that came forth and that new prophecy was the Proclamation for all the Jews to stand up for themselves and when the enemy comes in like a flood to raise up a standard against that enemy and slay them and we know that that's exactly what happened there was many people that got slayed in in that day but I just want to try and take that and and type it to devils even though we can have an enemy come against us to take our lives we have the ability another proclamation to take the life of the enemy that one that wants to oppress us that one that wants to come against us that wants to come against our marriage that wants to come against our our family our children our parents whatever it is we have the ability to defy that devil in the name of Jesus Christ to take its head off in the sight of all creation so that they can see all creation all the other Devils can see that there is a living God in his bride today this isn't something we just talk about it's something that we live it's Who We Are we don't have to tolerate Satan brothers and sisters the last one that I'm going to talk about tonight in nine minutes is shamgar Judges 3 verse 31 if you'll turn there with me Judges 3 verse 31. there's only a couple of verses in the entire Bible where his name is mentioned but in this message that I I referred to what is in thine hand brother Branham he just paints this picture he tells this story so good and I'll just try and and just paraphrase it quickly here before we close verse 31 of Judges chapter 3 and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox code and he also delivered Israel think about our testimonies brothers and sisters this is another reason why I just feel it's so important to have the testimony service to be able to talk and say what God's doing in our life Satan doesn't want us to talk about what God's do in our lives Satan wants us to just be quiet and keep it cool and and not talk about God being a living God in our lives because when it happens it increases faith it causes people to become encouraged and say you know if God would actually meet him on those terms then maybe he would meet me on on on the same terms and the same thing with the sisters in everyone's lives the children everyone has the opportunity to see the Lord actually manifest in their lives you know in this little tiny verse here brother Branham tells how the past few years the Philistines would come in and just maraud them after they would take in their Harvest and and how after their their Harvest was there and the Philistines would come in they would take all their food that would carry them over the winter can you imagine that it's what happens when Satan comes into our lives and we don't actually deal with them correctly he takes away this food that we actually take into our lives this this food that comes at Harvest Time and and is stored up for this season when we press play and we listen when when when the enemy has come in like a flood if we don't deal with them correctly then when we play press play or read or pray it's just not as nourishing it just doesn't happen the way that it should spiritually and so the Philistines come in and they actually come in to actually Murad and and take all the grain again but this one time this one time they start coming down the road and in shamgari hears them brother Branham says he hears the Thump Thump Thump Thump marching down the road and he knows it's the Philistines coming in again to take their grain this winter and he sees his wife she's getting uneasy she's starting to cry because she knows what this means and it's getting the children upset the children are saying Daddy what's going on why is mama upset is that the bad guy coming again and shamgar he's just like you know we've dealt with this in the past and they've they've gotten away with it and gotten away with it but not this time not this time no in the name of Jesus Christ and he grabs the ox goat and he goes out and slays all of them 600 of them and turns the enemy to flight just destroys them brothers and sisters we have the ability to do that in our own lives that's the encouragement that I wanted to bring to us tonight but what's in your hand do you have that aux code do you have that sling do you have the sword of the word is it an open book or or are we just sort of somewhere stuck maybe we haven't seen God activate his word in our life to such a degree where we actually see the results he wants to show us results in our lives but how does that come it comes with a greater sacrifice we've got to be willing to give more he's not going to come on our terms we have got to come on his terms but brothers and sisters if we have the ability to hear his voice if we have the ability to want to worship him then there's something in us that will easily come on his terms it doesn't take very much sometimes it's only just a tiny little Revival in our lives just a little tiny prayer meeting can set that that that that bondage those those bonds that are on our our arms holding us back keeping us from seeing the promises of God in our lives sometimes it just takes a little tiny bit and then those bonds go and you know what brother Branham says he says it with Divine Healing but I'll say it with anything that we're Afflicted with he says go with a pulsation you know sometimes we're inspired to do something and if we go and do it when we're inspired to do it amazing things happen but if we just let that inspiration pass by we might not get that inspiration ever again brother Bradham says that Christ might only talk to us one time in our entire lives I know in my life I heard his voice and nobody can take it away from me it's true man I heard it that might be your last call and I knew what that meant in my heart even though I didn't have a relationship with God that I knew of I I wasn't in fellowship with the Lord at the time but we know brother Branham says it in the message God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him every man hears from God before he dies every man we don't know what what God's been saying to the man but that man does brother Branham in that message he says the man just might brush it off and say oh it's just a funny feeling just a funny feeling that's all and he says it's not you can hear him say it in that but I just believe it brothers and sisters I want to encourage us to remember that we've got an open book we've got an ox code we've got that sling we've got the the entire word in our hands that we can take to the heart of the enemy and when we see the enemy come in he's a trespasser he has no right he has no right but he'll tell us that he has every right our flesh every right our mind every right our relationships every right our church it's the Devil he's a trespasser and he has no rights none because Christ stripped them all from him when he went to Calvary once and for all and I just believe it brothers and sisters that God is waiting for us to stand up for ourselves stand up for ourselves and just say no not this time you've done it many times but not this time this time I defy you in the name of the Living God this time I say no no and and just overcome might not know how I know for me I can only talk about my experience I had to do that when I came to church I had to say oh my I I think I know a lot of scriptures and I I was raised in the Pentecostal church but you know what I had to do I had to take it all and count it as dumb just like Paul did and say no I want you to reveal yourself to me as a living God today I want to take you as as a man just like I would take take part in any of these other things in the world I want to take part in the Lord Jesus Christ I want you to reveal yourself so much to me that I know that you truly are a living God and actually my prayer when I first started coming around was that I want you to feel me so full of your Holy Spirit Lord that there's just no room for anything else in this world just nothing else in this world there was nothing else in this world that I want more than you in me and you know he answered my prayer he will answer your prayer when you ask according to his word but you know what it's got to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and it will manifest by the fruit it bears in your life and when that happens it just is a Perpetual thing you just can't get enough just keep coming back to The Well of Grace my goodness maybe stand with me tonight we'll try and wrap it up here but but shamgar he took an ox code and thrashed 600 men think about all the Devils that you could thrash with an open word that was an ox code and we know that's just basically a stick with a brass end on it but the Bride of Jesus Christ today his elect lady she has Authority we don't have to tolerate occupying enemies in our lives in our families in our church we don't have to do that brothers and sisters but I think Satan he just wants us to sugarcoat it he wants us to just keep it under the rug don't don't make don't make a scene keep it cool right remember the story in Samson we've got the occupiers in the land and we don't want to get the Philistines upset so now we're just going to take you and deliver you to them so that they'll just keep it cool and we'll keep the peace in the land when they should have been saying no we want to get behind you and take you up there and and just have a prayer meeting and just allow you to thrash all of them and get them all out of here is what they should have been doing he was the one with the ball they should have been getting right behind their brother foreign Brothers and Sisters Let's just rise up in the mighty name of Jehovah and Slay Slay the Devils that haunts us we don't have to tolerate them you don't have to tolerate them we don't have to tolerate them just rise up in the name of Jesus Christ and just shake off those bonds forever don't shake them off today and put them on tomorrow don't wake up the old man let him die every single Speck of them just let them die let that old man pass away let that old carnality just go out of the Palmer worm canker worm caterpillar and Locust in 1953 shamgar didn't have no sword he didn't have nothing about it if he had one he didn't have a shield but if he'd a shield he wouldn't know how to use it he was just a simple farmer but there came a point in his life where he said that's enough look what you're doing to my family look what you're doing to all of Israel but if he had a shield he wouldn't know how to use it but he reached up and he got an ox go that's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it they beat the ox through the Corral with it and he jumped out that window out there in the middle of that road against 600 armed Philistines and killed every one of them what was it Holy Spirit Come on him Hallelujah but you know in those days they say the Holy Spirit wasn't yet given but here we have the prophet for our day saying that was the Holy Spirit that came on him the life of Jesus Christ came on him and he went out and slew all those devils he jumped out the window he took action he got after it and he finally said I'm tired of this I don't have to tolerate this anymore they're trespassing on my land they're coming against the promises of God he said that we would we would build and no one will inhabit and that will will prosper but these guys come in and think that they can just take over and take everything that we've worked so hard for no no that holy spirit rose up at him what was it the Holy Spirit Come on him Hallelujah there was a need there was a need there was an emergency something had to be done imagine brothers and sisters he didn't go and have a prayer meeting he didn't he didn't go and fast for a week he didn't listen to the most messages he's ever listened to he acted it was an emergency and he went after it there was a need there was an emergency something had to be done he couldn't wait till he got an education learn how to fight and be a warrior and train up he had to take what was in his hand and go do something with it and brother what's that close to you tonight what's that close to us tonight brothers and sisters you've at least got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this whole group here and I say that here this whole group here everybody here the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've at least got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this whole group here you raised your hands what's that the greatest weapon you can put in your hands foreign with the word of God behind it to back it up he says this don't let them rob you don't let them rob you we don't have to let them Rob us brothers and sisters he wants to come in and steal he wants to come in and lie he wants to come in and destroy but isn't it amazing how we just carry on remember if Satan had his way we would be destroyed he would snuff us out like that if he could think about all the trials we go through think about how many miles we've come in our lives and we're still here through many dangers toils and snares my goodness brothers and sisters you know afterwards that's where we meet Melchizedek after the battle is fought after we come to that place where we say enough that's where Melchizedek comes out and serves us communion and that's the Lord Jesus Christ revealing himself to us personally giving us of himself the stimulation of Revelation you know once that happens once we have that testimony we've overcome by our testimony Satan can never come in and Rob us again because we begin to recognize his tactics we begin to see the patterns and when we see those patterns happening then we can just identify it and then we can just rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ not bring a railing accusation against it just simply speak the word and go forwards and know that he's going to back it up and not let him Rob us anymore not be a trespasser not welcome an unwelcome guest that just won't leave he has to leave and that's the beautiful part it's not like he just might leave and and if we speak the word that maybe he'll leave and that's the trick of the devil he wants us to to believe that that's the case but you know he has to he has to leave if we go according to the word let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord Jesus we just thank you for your word we thank you Father for what you've placed in our hands Lord Jesus I pray that I myself could just recognize all that you have put in my hands father I pray that every one of us could have that

situation father that peace that passes all understanding that's what we're praying for and we know that everything else will be added unto us if we seek ye first the kingdom of God so Lord Jesus
