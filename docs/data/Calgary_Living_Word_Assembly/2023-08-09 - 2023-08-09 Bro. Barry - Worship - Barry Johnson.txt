for coming by our way tonight Lord we know we don't need to invite you here because we know that we've already declared that we have gathered together in your name and if there's any devil that would be present that wouldn't be sure about that in the name of Jesus Christ we declare this meeting unto you Lord Jesus and we just want to bind every Spirit now that's contrary to yours in the name of Jesus Christ and a juror to leave here now and father we just loose your spirit according to your word we just want to remind you Daddy of your word you said that whatever we bind on Earth would be

we thank you for your presence Lord and we just invite you to just walk up and down the aisles father that you would be a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of each one of our hearts Lord that there would be one person not be one person present either in in person here physically or virtually Lord that would not experience that kind of a presence tonight father we know that you're not bound by time or space and we just ask father that you would have the preeminence Lord oh Father we know that we had your Prophet here on Earth and and he said Lord search the people and try them oh Father and start with me search me and try me Lord father I want to put myself in that spot Lord Jesus I don't believe there's any one of us that wants to try and hide anything from you Lord father we don't want a covering Lord we just want you we want your word so father tonight we just ask that you would meet each and every need made known unto you with an uplift hand as we come to you with surrendered Hearts father fully submitted unto you as our headship as our leader father we just invite you to take the position the rightful position of our hearts Lord the throne that you've created and father

praise and all the glory of Our Lives as we go forwards thank you for father for speaking to us once again as we walk with you along the way we just ask all these things now when Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen I just would like to invite the deacons to come forward tonight we have a prayer request Sister Mary Jeanette has a sore leg and she's asked for her to be Anointed with oil and we know the prophet said that if we really understood our position if we really understood what what happens that we would just come to the front of the church we would call for the elders we would be Anointed with oil and that would be that and I just pray that we could all get to that level of faith and and I say again Lord help me help thou my unbelief I believe but we all need to have that but we've been given this as an opportunity for us to come before the Lord and we know that he always answers amen so tonight let's just unite together in the name of Jesus Christ for our sister that the Lord would heal her leg [Music] soon gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we know your Prophet has said that we don't need to lay hands father we just need to speak the word that's the promise to the Gentile but father we know that you also said through your Prophet that if we would just simply understand our position we could be Anointed with oil and believe and that would be that I believe it's no accident we sang the songs that we've sung tonight I believe it's no accident we've set the atmosphere that we are in because we know that we're in your presence now father and father tonight we just want to commit Sister Mary Jeanette unto you Lord according to her Faith Lord Jesus knowing that it's not even her Faith Lord that it's truly yours living out to her father We Believe tonight and

thank you Lord Jesus oh Lord I believe Lord I believe all things oh [Music] I believe oh things are possible [Music] amen welcome to the house of the Lord tonight thank you musicians certainly appreciate each gift you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Saint John chapter 4. very familiar scripture I would like to take it from a little bit of a different angle tonight we'll just start reading with verse one Saint John chapter 4. trust that the Lord will speak to us it's a story of the woman at Samaria the woman at the well and uh let's start with verse one Saint John chapter 4. when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed into Galilee excuse me and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called saikar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being worried with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour to cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me a drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask is drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have have asked him and he would have given the Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Once then hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus said saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus saith unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now has is not thy husband in that setest thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this word we thank you for this story Lord we thank you for the unveiling of God because we know that when you came in the form of Jesus Christ you were the unveiling of God and Lord we know that you change not and that you are the same yesterday today and forever and as we read this word father as we pursue you through this word Lord Jesus we know that you unveil yourself layer by layer day by day service by service word by word song by song Father we come to know you in a greater way and father tonight is no different we just desire to know you a little more to come a little closer father to go a little higher and we just invite you father to just break this bread of life unto us once again will be careful to give you all the praise Lord just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I bless you tonight you may be seated a couple of announcements we have confirmed with brother Andrew he will be here Friday evening and we'll have two services this weekend it's been interesting because he uh I think he's he got really sick recently he was preaching at a a youth camp and he said to me this week that he had bronchitis and a sinus infection and he was actually going to fly into Edmonton and then come down to Calgary and he had to cancel the service in Edmonton so that he could take some rest to come here and I said to him if you want to reschedule it's okay we can we can work around it I know there's people that wanted to come but I certainly don't want to put a lot of pressure on a man just because we're having Services we want to make sure that our brothers feel strong so he said to me everything is fine and he's rebooked his ticket to fly into Calgary so he'll be here Friday evening and we'll have two services this weekend Saturday night and then Sunday morning regular time we have the Youth Event coming up on the 18th ladies brunch on the 26th and a potluck again on the 27th and I believe after that we'll be back in school and up to our old routines again for the most part some people are seeing children go back into school sooner than the end of the month and some of us will be going in in September but we just trust the Lord will watch over the children as we uh as we get into this next routine of Our Lives are you happy tonight certainly wonderful to see everyone come out on a on a Wednesday evening it's kind of difficult when people are traveling but we trust that they're being fed where ever they are I got to speak to brother Jonah emkey this week in Kelowna had a great conversation as always he has been such an encouragement for me in stepping into this role of Pastor and he just said please greet the Saints for me just say hello to Calgary Living Word so greetings from Brother uh Jonah emke in Kelowna we have uh our scripture tonight I would like to begin I guess the topic of talking about worship and understanding that worship is just a a part of the believer's life when we believe we worship it's that simple we cannot be a believer and not worship because the word of God says that the father seeketh such to worship him those who Worship in spirit and in truth there's a lot of stuff that I want to go over and I'm really not going to rush through this I'm going to take some time we'll probably be going over and over and over as we go through this into the future there's many many things about it but tonight I'll maybe just do a little bit of a high level flyover and we'll just see many times we have really well-laid plans and the Lord just takes control and it's funny how things go so one of the things that I saw in church order in studying worship is that brother Branham says you know the the pastor ought to come out and just talk for 30 minutes maybe 40 45 minutes and be done and I thought that was really good for me you know because I I have people calling on me to preach a three-hour service and I know that after about 40 minutes 45 minutes you start to lose the people but at the same time when the spirit's moving we can go a three-hour service and be like how did that happen because it only feels like we've been here half an hour when the Lord moves we're the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty we're going to get into that scripture tonight I think it's really good it's important for us to recognize that when we meet here in the house of the Lord we've come here to worship God and if we've come for any other reason brothers and sisters I think that maybe we need to just check up a little bit because that's why we we gather as Believers we come to worship God and you know that is where our blessing is going to lie it's not going to lie in coming to church and and just going through a form of ritual and and and and sacraments and and and traditions and think that God's going to be happy with that he's not going to be happy with that in fact if that's what we're doing then we don't even know who we're worshiping we're we're stuck in a position where you know I I I think it's it's it's a dangerous place to be if we don't know who the God is the present tense I am we talked about it on Sunday you know I am the resurrection and the life it's one thing to say that he's the resurrection and oh my I believe that he rose from the dead and I claim him as as my savior but is he Lord because if he's Lord then he has that life living out through you you have the ability to say Amen to the word but you know we're talking tonight about worshiping in and it has to be in spirit and it has to be in truth and the only way that we're going to be able to worship Him truly is to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives that is the spirit that's the only Spirit that's going to be able to be accepted there's a lot of other spirits around we know that but the only way a Believer today is going to be able to worship Him is in the Holy Ghost and we know that when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we can sing in the spirit we can dance in the spirit we can we can speak in the spirit there's many different fruit of the Holy Spirit right we're not going to make make any bones about that but we want to make sure that if if we see a manifestation of that in our midst that we want people to have the Liberty to experience that we don't want to try and and and and put a stop to it and say you're not doing it the way that I feel like you should do it this isn't the way that I've ever experienced before in my life if we're going to do that then we're going to stop the spirit of God remember he's timid he's a gentleman he's a dove he's not going to force his way anywhere but I think it's important to recognize that we have the ability to worship Him in spirit truly in Spirit by the holy spirit in our lives and that's why one of the reasons why we we can't over emphasize the importance of getting in the spirit brother Branham says the baptism of the Holy Spirit but we're not going to go too far with that tonight we just need to understand that we have to have the spirit there's one spirit and and that is the Lord Jesus Christ his life living out through us and then in truth truth it's a beautiful thought when we when we can think about truth what truly is truth you know there was a man one day that stood in the presence of Truth and he said what is truth he didn't recognize Jesus Christ was God himself standing in the flesh even when his wife warned him don't don't condemn this man he's an innocent man I've had dreams about this it's going to turn really bad if you do that what did pilate do he washed his hands and he said oh I just washed my hands of the situation had full power to deal with it did I lose the microphone it sounds like it died it's okay did you adjust it somehow I yeah sorry but pilate he washed his hands of the circumstance of the situation he didn't want anything to do with it but we know that what he did was he sealed his fate in doing so and brothers and sisters when we come right face to face with the truth in our day and we wash our hands of it and we say oh no I'm not going to get that way I'm not going to do that I'm just going to step back and say that's not according to my Creeds or my dogmas or my traditions or my ways if we start doing that we're going to seal Our Fate you know brother banham preaches that message there sorry I'm going to quote it wrong there's a time there's always a time in our life when we have the opportunity to accept or reject tonight I'll just get into the notes here and we'll just see what the Lord will do I'm just going to take from verse 23 and 24 from this story but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him we need to recognize brothers and sisters we have that ability because if we truly have received the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then that means we truly have received the message of the hour because outside of the message of the hour or getting baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but outside of that we're actually coming not according to the formula to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit but when we get there we're able to worship Him in spirit and in truth and we know that he always comes where he's invited and we when we worship Him and we go into the Spirit Worship Him in spirit according to the truth of the hour the truth of our day the truth of the message of the hour recognizing that he's already done it all we've done nothing but he has done it all he has paid it all for our sakes when we can come to that place brothers and sisters he will take and make us exactly the way he wants us to be he will receive our worship when we can give him worship that he will receive what do you think will happen in our lives I think it will just unlock everything it will take this book and make it a brand new book to us the way we deal with our brothers and sisters we'll look at them differently we'll act differently we'll sing differently we'll pray differently everything in our life changes we become new creatures in Christ Jesus and when we have the ability to recognize that I just think the the the opportunities are Limitless not not for us to make a show we know the the third poll the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not not for a public show God doesn't clown for nobody we're not going to say I'm just gonna do something and and make something happen you know that's that's that's potentially working iniquity we're not going to do that we know that there's people that Jesus said will uh will come to him on that day and say Lord Lord didn't we cast out devils in thy name didn't we have many many many wonderful services and mighty works of the Holy Ghost in our lives and what will he say he'll say depart from me ye workers of iniquity because I never even knew you and what does that mean that means that they never actually came according to the word for their day and according to the word for their day today is getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost but once we get that brothers and sisters that's all we need because we'll always come according to the word we'll say Amen to that word when it comes our way worshiping in spirit and in truth the father seeketh such to worship Him he's not looking for people outside of that you know what brother Branham says it it gets hard it gets real hard when we start looking at this brothers and sisters but just to recognize what the prophet of God said he says there's millions and billions of people in this age impersonating Christianity I know there's so many things I want to say and I'm just I'm just going to take my time as we go through this because it's so important for us to recognize really if we have come according to the way God has provided for us brothers and sisters there ain't no culture there ain't no country there ain't nothing to hold us back we've got the ability to worship him the way that he desires to be worshiped and if we want to see him move in our lives worship Him give him the glory that he desires God is an object of worship he wants worship Brother Brad I'm talking about getting in the spirit in 1961 I've got a few quotes tonight paragraph 125 of getting in the spirit it's zero four two eight I'll just start paragraph 125. he says now we're a school of prophets we got it all fixed up we know just exactly what he ought to do we know just how he ought to do we know that the only thing thing you have to do is come in and say I believe and shake hands and we'll sprinkle this way or baptize this way or back this way or that way or oh my and we got it now that's just the way he does and you go ahead and you baptize this way and baptize that way and sprinkle this way and sprinkle that way and take communion this way and that way and you still find out you got no God you got a form of rituals and I'm just going to pause there and say this brothers and sisters as parents it behooves us to teach our children that we don't have a god of rituals we serve the Living God he's the present tense I am in every situation of Our Lives the people we are here in this building is the people we are behind closed doors in our house we're not different people at work we're not different people at school we're believers sometimes you can have this this this way where we we come to church and we say Amen just right and and we've got our rituals just right and if something is out of order from our just right then it's a big deal it's a big problem and we don't know what to do I just want to encourage us to just remember let your hair down relax if there's ever a place you can be relaxed it's in here as believers we're going to get into it but brother Branham he says that you know what the whole world gets into the spirit of their stuff what about the Bride of Jesus Christ can we get into the spirit or does it scare us does it make us frightened sometimes if we sing too loud if we shout too loud if the preacher's too loud all these different things can be just get maybe in the way of our our way don't worry about our way worry about his way let his way be the way sprinkle this way sprinkle that way take communion this way and that way and you still find out you got no God you got a form of rituals that's all God is a spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth amen God sends us Prophets God send us prophets back to tear up the thing I think this is beautiful and it just you know what I I just can't help but think it's just an encouragement as a preacher to think that really this is what we need to do we need to tear down those things brothers and sisters if we've got forms of of righteousness if we've got high places if we've got Groves all different ways in our lives and they don't line up with the word of God according to the message of the hour we've got to tear them down we've got to get rid of them we've got to make sure that we boot them out of our homes and boot them out of our families and boot them out of our Lives boot them out of our churches God is only going to accept one form of worship and that is in spirit and in truth and I would say that's him searching for a genuine heart one that's going to say Lord I I know that I'm nobody I'm nothing search my heart and try me I don't have anything to hide from you Lord but we talked about it a long time ago and we've got doors and door when there's that one spot that we just won't open we're afraid to open that door don't go you can go anywhere you want to preacher but don't go there uh oh there's a problem God wants every single door in the house open and when he sees that he sees he's got a dedicated human he's got a person that's fully surrendered we need to make sure that that we we don't have all these different ways he says amen God send us prophets back to tear the thing up and to bring out the truth that will show it vain theology oh my I just think about this and I think Lord help me not have vain theology I don't want to have anything that would hinder your spirit from moving in my life I don't want to have any Traditions any Creeds I don't want a hybrid message of the hour I want the truth remember brother Branham said when he went beyond the curtain of time stay straight on that word there's only one thing that's going to get us to the other side and that's going to be divine love the love of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us but if we got reservations and say oh there's this and there's that and there's the other where are we at brothers and sisters remember the father he seeks those to worship Him in spirit and in truth those are the ones that he wants he's not interested in the half-baked Christian experience he's not interested in the unbelievers he's only interested in those that are not afraid to disclose their eyes and open their hearts and lift up their hands and give him the glory that he deserves and where I really want to get with this is to recognize that you know many times we'll hear people say well now you're dealing On Emotion I think it's beautiful we're we're not even getting started tonight and it's already 9 30. my goodness 8 30 sorry we have uh we have this sorry honey I didn't mean to scare you we have this understanding that you know John is is a type of the Bride that's what the prophet of God said he's the type of the bride and he was called higher he was called to a a greater Revelation he wasn't invited to just stay where he was to stay where all the disciples were no you have been called to a special elevation a special place a place that nobody gets to come except for my truly elect and you know when he heard that voice he saw that door open in heaven as the Bride of Jesus Christ recognizes when she hears that voice it's not the voice of a man that attracts her it's not the voice of a a hillbilly from Kentucky that attracts her it's the voice behind the sign that attracts her it's the voice from that open door in heaven saying there's a revelation here if you can receive it just come a little higher into this Revelation and I'll show you things to come we talked about it months ago maybe even years ago I think it's so beautiful I just want to dwell on it for a little while I hope it's okay you know what there's a difference between this we say the prophet of God says that this the Holy Ghost is without sensation that's what the prophet of God says and I know we can all say Amen to that but he doesn't say it's without emotion but many times we can take and actually couple the two together and say that it's the same thing it's not the same thing the prophet of God says it and I can bring quotes up to to back up there's ample quotes about it where he says there is a uh not a sensation but there is an emotion with it there is an emotion when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't sit there like a dried up old stick you can't help but Worship in spirit because you recognize you've got the truth remember John in his experience I want to say this and many people might might I don't know I shouldn't say that for forgive me for doing that when I do I I need to change my way I believe John got the Holy Ghost because John went to heaven John he went to a place where nobody gets to go but what did he do there brothers and sisters he saw the the the the the the he saw God sitting on the throne one with the book of redemption in his head and it was a closed book and what did he do he wept he had a sensation he had an emotion he wept because he recognized if there wasn't someone worthy to take that book and open it to reveal his name and all the bride's name that we were all lost so he wept when it was oh when it was closed but he also rejoiced greatly when he recognized oh my there was one worthy to take that book and to open it and to look thereon and he rejoiced there is there is an emotion brothers and sisters and we don't need to be afraid of emotion if we've got the truth and we're in the spirit out of I am he in 1959. it is I sorry it is I Be not Afraid in 1959 I apologize zero eight one one it is I be not afraid I think we went over this a little while ago but I love how brother Bradham he just brings out this story I'm just going to take some time and read this tonight and we might only get this far and I think that's okay but we'll just see what the Lord will do here paragraph 22 it is I be not afraid Andrew brother Branham he he he he narrates this story Through The Eyes of Andrew a disciple who who witnessed what was happening at the well in Samaria then and this paragraph 22 then Andrew must have stopped oing just a moment and he said Brethren did not our hearts burn within us when we seen him no more than a man wary in his way and he sat down on the well he was so tired he couldn't go down into Samaria with us that day when we get went to get him some victuals get to some victuals for him and and how we talked on the road about how how we loved him and before they would even give us the food here come a woman down the street screaming come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah isn't it him can you imagine those disciples they would have been like oh he's up there we better go we better get that food and get up there to him come and see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah isn't it him for he said to me when I was out there to get a bucket of water I just went to the well like I always do and I heard someone ask me for a drink and I looked over and seen a middle-aged Jew and he said to me woman bring me a drink and I said it's not customary for you Jews to ask Samaritan such and he said if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink I'd give you water that you don't come here to draw oh we got to talking about different denominations and the places to worship and he told me that God was a spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth I just want to pause there for a second to think about this just to emphasize this here she is talking to God and he's explaining to her through Jesus God in flesh he's explaining to her that they who worship will worship in spirit and Truth there will be people that do it and we know that she desired to worship she had a thirst we know brother Bradham he preaches so much on this topic she had a thirst and that thirst could only be satisfied by one thing many times in this world we have thirsts that will only be satisfied by one thing she tried to fill it with husbands she tried to fill it with many different things but here she meets him in person and what happened to her it changed her life that conversation she recognized this man he actually has truth there is truth here because I had been taught my whole entire life that something like this was going to happen and now here I perceive that this man is the prophet he's right here in front of me he told me that God was a spirit and they must worship they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth then I shall never forget she might have said this when he turned those piercing eyes against me and he said woman go get your and I said to him I don't husband and you men know how many I've lived and you know you men know how many I've lived and he said no you have no husband because you've had five husbands and the one that you're now living with is not yours and of course she'd say something like this I was surprised we don't have such in our churches today and I turn quickly to look at him and I said sir I perceive that you are a prophet We Know by the Messiah will be a prophet for when he comes he will tell us such things and this is the words that he said I am he that speaks to you and tonight brothers and sisters I just want to say we all have that opportunity to be that woman at the well where he will come to us we don't seek Him brother Bradham says it in the message we don't go just stumble into the the mission on the corner and suddenly we we get this message of the hour man doesn't seek God God seeks man and when he comes he speaks to us he'll tell us the things that that nobody knows about us and you know what's sad is sometimes not not sometimes I think every time God will speak to us through the pulpit he'll speak to us through a tape he'll speak to us when we read our Bible and we can take the Bible and we can take the take but when it comes to the pulpit it can be a difficult thing because it can sound like someone's been talking about our life but you know brothers and sisters I want to encourage you tonight if you hear God speak to you through the pulpit no one is going behind your back and talking to me no one's going behind your back and talking to other brothers it's God it's the Holy Ghost it's spirit and Truth coming your way just like this woman at the well only we don't have a well to go to we've got a church to come to we've got a place where we can come where we know that he will meet us because he's provided it for us you know the word itself is truth for us today that is the truth the word of God and the word of God becomes flesh and I would say not just dwells Among Us now it dwells in US and remember John he wasn't instructed you know it's wonderful to see that the lamb has come and taken the book and and that Lamb with the book John was instructed to come and take the book wasn't he John being a type of the Bride tonight I want to say this brothers and sisters as the Bride of Jesus Christ we've been instructed to come and take the book also but not just take the Book and Tape and say that I've got the books and tapes so it's all good supposed to take the book and eat it and what's going to happen is it's going to be sweet as honey in our mouth isn't it we're going to be so sweet when we talk about the message of the hour and so sweet when we talk about the messenger and and all of the message and all the stories are going to be so sweet when they ring out in our ears but it's going to make our bellies bitter it's going to make us uncomfortable we're not going to feel at home we're going to feel like strangers and pilgrims like we're we're looking for a city with with a foundation but it's a foundation made by God it's not a place that we can come to in this world where we're going to feel comfortable we're going to come to a place where we're just not comfortable but we've been instructed to take the book and eat it too and what happens to us when that happens brothers and sisters is we become the book we're no longer just looking at books and tapes and saying that's where my salvation lies that's where it's all at it's not just in the books and tapes it's in Christ Jesus taking up his Abode in our lives you know out of Jezebel religion in 1961 talking about spirit and Truth tonight worshiping God in spirit and Truth and Jezebel religion 610319 paragraph 21. remember the Good Samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to the Inn that's the church and gave the man their two pence and told him if he needed any more he'd pay him when he come so he's got two pence he's able he's able to doctor you up if he's a man of God if he's a man of God that stands on the word of God he's got what God gave him the spirit and the word is that right how is it we're to worship in spirit and in truth and the word is truth is that right I just want to say tonight brothers and sisters the word of God operates in ways that we don't comprehend with our mind it's beautiful thing isn't it and I'm sure that we all understand it but sometimes we just need to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remember it sometimes maybe the children haven't heard it or or maybe don't understand it the way that we're talking about it so just bear with me if if you're a veteran in the word and you get it you understand this but as we as we go forwards I think it's important to recognize that the Lord God himself will minister to us the way that we need to be ministered to and I want to say it just from experience from my own little experience when I first came to church I came to church I was invited to come to special meetings to hear the the great evangelists come and and to hear another evangelist come and and the person that invited me which is my wife she she said to me she had a bit of a revelation at one point she said why would I want him to come and just hear an evangelist talk when I want I think it would be good for him to come and just hear what my pastor says isn't it important to just hear what the regular everyday Pastor has to say I think it's beautiful because in the end that's what I did I came on a regular Wednesday night service that's what changed my life forever brothers and sisters was a Wednesday night service hearing brother Ken preach and I didn't understand all of the the stuff that he was talking about I didn't understand the doctrines I I didn't even understand that you could get the message of the hour as something that you could have as your own to study and look at for months after I came to church but what I did understand was that there was something true here that there was some truth and there was Spirit when we would enter into the pre-service music brothers and sisters it did something to me and I can say that I needed it it washed me by the water of the word by the pre-service music there's an anointing to that coming to church early it does something to us it sets the atmosphere in our lives it allows us to turn off all of the world and all of The Temptations and troubles and problems of the world that we have that's why we come to church a little bit early we're going to get into all of this the prophet gave us instructions very clear instructions and I would say this it was God that gave the prophet instructions for us so that we would be able to come to this place where we're worshiping in spirit and truth because there's coming a time but now is where people will worship Him in spirit and in truth it's not just something that we're talking about that's kind of a a fun thing or maybe just a fantastic thing brothers and sisters we're coming to meet with God Almighty there's so many aspects of this that we can get into and probably will God permitting in time brother Adams he says so he's got two pence he's able to dock you up if he's a man of God if he's a man of God that stands on the word of God he's got what God gave him the spirit and the word is that right how is it we are to Worship in spirit and in truth and the word is the truth is that right so I just want to make those points to understand that God is a spirit and he desires to be worshiped and his word is the truth and if we have both of those coming together brothers and sisters we've got the Dynamics we've got all the mechanics and I want to say thank you to each of the musicians that bring of their gifts week after week tirelessly wanting to give of their gift I can only imagine what it would be like to be a musician and and get in the spirit and fall under the anointing it would be so difficult to not want to play the loudest and maybe fastest as I could or or however the spirit leads me but for the musicians to all come together and and play One music that's the anointing of God and I just want to make this point that you know we're not we're not setting an atmosphere for devils we're setting an atmosphere for the spirit of God to move and that's our sole purpose that's our sole desire every single one of the musicians that comes up here I want to say this tonight they've got the Holy Ghost or they won't be coming up here and I want to say this also some people might say oh brother Barry how could you say that some of those young people how do you know that I don't want to challenge that I don't want to say they don't got the Holy Ghost and I think it would be a dangerous place for anyone to say that someone doesn't if they're willing to subject themselves to the word of God I've witnessed it maybe I shouldn't go there but I'm doing I'm gonna I've witnessed it or a young person has had a gift and and come to play to offer it to the Lord and someone else in the church come and destroy that person to another person and what that did was that took that person away from potentially being able to play their gift in the church and potentially being able to come up in the spirit and get Washed by the Water of the word and now where are they I want to say this they're not in church but that doesn't mean that God won't deal with them I do think that it means that someone's going to answer for that one day I wouldn't want to be that person we don't ever want to you know that's one of the things that my pastor taught me early on and I'm so thankful for it he witnessed me coming up in in the stages we go through the stages don't we as Believers we come through the justification stage and we get saved and we're all amongst Angels Everyone's an angel isn't it wonderful when we're saved it's just beautiful to come to church and we get Washed by the Water of the word we have the pre-service music and we're amongst angels and maybe we have potlucks and fellowship and it's just beautiful then we come to sanctification and we get all cleansed out now and set aside for service and then we start to look around and recognize whoa some people are they're actually people they're not angels I can see the hind parts of that person and and they never treated me right and and I can see what they do and and the other one man they're Christians whoo but isn't it interesting we're going through the stages and you know what brother Ken he taught me he said you'd never judge someone's experience that's not up to you to judge you judge your own experience you work on yourself and when you start to get that rising up inside of you where you're judging someone else's experience it's time to get back to the altar brother Branham even says it maybe not exactly that way we need to make sure that we're not judging other people's experience what we want to do is be an encouragement we want to help people get to the word of God we want to help people get to worshiping and spirited and Truth not hinder them not hold them back and say that you're not doing it my way you're not doing it the way that I taught you're not behaving the way that I thought you should be you know when we start doing that brothers and sisters you can go through justification and you can go to sanctification but you can get stuck in sanctification stuck there where everything that happens is something to criticize that's not a believer's life no we want to see everyone come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to step Beyond those stages where we can say you know what it's not up to me to judge people it's up to God to judge people I just want to encourage people to get to God but if we just go and demonstrate a critical spirit then what are we going to do you know we want to make every minute count brothers and sisters we're here for a purpose now I want to say this really checked me as I was going through this we want to make every minute count I think about how many minutes I have in a day and what do I do with them what do we do with our minutes how do we how do we make our lives better how do we help other people around us because whether Bradham said eternal life is living for others so what are we doing here out of Confirmation and evidence 1962. zero six two one e paragraph 27. but the Branham says now let's let's listen real close as I'm giving you giving a moment of time for you to get to the scripture so he's just going to take his text but he just drops this little note in here he says remember that we mustn't never come to church to play religious we must have come to just put on a religious Act to go to church we must come to Worship in spirit and in truth and I just I just I just want to say this we must come to Worship in spirit and in truth brothers and sisters saying Amen to the word of the preaching of the word is one portion of it but he's looking for worship he wants to hear our voice worship Him and and if we have something that's going to stand in our way that's going to stop us from being able to worship Him is he going to say that's okay my word said that I wanted you to worship me but you never did because that whatever circumstance or situation happens so you know don't worry about it what's he going to say to all the other people he's a just God he's not a dodeal grandpa he's only going to judge the World by his word and we've got to recognize that we have the opportunity to come and worship him in spirit and in truth we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah we've got the truth of the message of the hour yeah so why can't we worship Him in spirit and Truth give him all of the glory of Our Lives I'm not saying we don't brothers and sisters I want to encourage us if you've got more in you then give it give it to him don't hold it back don't wait for some day where it's all going to be different and better because the Rapture is going to happen any one of these days we don't want to be found saying oh my I could have given more but I just held it in me because of brother so and so or sister such and such or whatever the person or or situation was I want to give you another example when I first started preaching I believe the Lord has dealt with me many different ways many different times but this was a time where brother Ken had went away and he said I I know he thought this he never said it directly but I trust you to take a service in my stead I trust you as a Believer to just take the service and go and preach it and and and I know that it will all be fine I entrust you with the word to get behind that sacred pulpit and and so I went and had to live my life that day and I got into a circumstance a situation with another brother and and I could not for the life of me get Beyond get over myself let's put it that way I had such a problem and I thought you know what I'm just not doing I'm just not preaching I'm just so upset in my spirit I'm just going to bring the wrong attitude to church I just can't do it forget it I'm not going to preach and you know it was like I don't know one of the first few times uh to preach and I told Brother Ken I've got this thing I got a preacher so he says okay I trust you and then the Devil comes around and does that right we can look at it now and say yeah obviously that's what happened but here I am thrown in the towel forget it I'm not even gonna preach I can't do it I'm gonna have the wrong spirit I go and sit down on the study and just what am I going to do and I believe the Lord said that what are you going to do you're going to quit are you a quitter you think you're preaching your word you're preaching my word get up and go and see if I won't come and vindicate it for me it changed it it gave me the ability to recognize I'm not going to let no situation or no brother no sister no no anything that I think should stop me from coming and preaching I'm going to get right in my position and just allow God to move and I want to say it tonight brothers and sisters if we can get ourselves into our position to Worship in spirit and truth and just forget about all the rest of it just watch what God will do and I believe it with all my heart there's a reason why he wants to go this way one of the things I've said in the past I'm going to keep saying it on and on and on there's coming a time where we're not going to have prayer meetings we're not going to be talking about the message of the hour and quoting quotes and and coming to church and doing all these things that we're doing brothers and sisters we're just going to be worshiping God we're just going to be giving him praise and thanking him for calling us before the foundation of the world to be the recipients in the last age remember that we mustn't never come to church to play religious and I want to say this to have a covering I can hide behind my my cloak of of religion and say that I believe the message of the hour God sees right through it must it never come to church to play religious we mustn't come just to put on a religious act to go to church we mustn't come to church or we must come to church in spirit and in truth we must deeply and sincerely we must really mean what we're coming here for and I just think it's beautiful I want to pause there for a second and just say God bless you each one who's willing to take your gift and offer it to the Lord because I believe each musician deeply and sincerely understands what they're doing we're not coming just to play in a band you know why I'm going this way but I'm going to do it if we have people that are criticizing are you bringing a gift because until we're willing to actually give something what are we criticizing encourage brothers and sisters if you think it should be different encourage it ask God to make it different and see if he won't but first you've got to Worship in spirit and a truth that's the trouble isn't it that's the challenge remember we must never come to church to play religious we mustn't come just to put on a religious act to go to church we must come to Worship in spirit and in truth we must deeply and sincerely we must really mean what we're coming here for the days they're getting evil the time is evil and we want to make every minute count and especially when we're in the house of the Lord brothers and sisters I want to say this the whole world is evil we have this opportunity to come and worship Before the Throne of God Almighty why would we want to get caught up thinking things should be something different or a different way or something other than what it is what if we were just to push it all aside and say I'm going to give my all because I recognize what God's done for me in my life I think we have the opportunity brothers and sisters to worship God in spirit and in truth because he's told us the father seeketh such to worship Him I've got a quote here that I'm not going to read tonight I'm just going to jump over it because I think it's so important I really want to dwell on it later I'll call the musicians I don't want to keep us too long tonight in Luke chapter 19. maybe if you turn there with me verse 36 story that we talked about a little while ago at Easter Jesus coming into Jerusalem riding on the ass of a full fall of an ass I mean verse 36 Luke chapter 19 as he went they spread their clothes in the way when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that he had seen isn't that beautiful I want to encourage you tonight brothers and sisters ever who's listening if you have seen the Great Mighty works of the Lord Jesus Christ Rejoice with a loud voice don't be bashful to shout to shout unto the Lord to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that he has done for you that you have seen verse 38 says saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest isn't it interesting the Bible documents now the religious ones the ones who were there they were all around weren't they they were there in the midst and some of the Pharisees among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples oh my they're getting a little bit out of order they're they're maybe they're playing the music a little too loud or maybe a little too fast and and maybe they're they're singing a little too contemporary of songs where's their heart are they rejoicing for what God has done for them in their lives some of the Pharisees among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out all creation is groaning brothers and sisters for the manifestations of the sons of God and you know when the sons of God manifest what what happened before the before when when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God they shouted for joy they didn't just quietly say amen and and sing at a at a normal churchiosity level so everyone's comfortable it wasn't about that it was about expressing that I understood that if God didn't call me before the foundation of the world to be his elect in the last day that I would be lost as lost can be I would be one of those millions and billions of people out there who could potentially be impersonating Christianity or worse I could be one that was never called to be saved and just completely lost created according to election to be destroyed there's people in this world like that we know the word of God says Pharaoh was created to be destroyed so God could demonstrate his power but there were some that were created to be saved brothers and sisters we've got every single reason to rejoice to not hold back to not worry about what anybody thinks only worry about what he thinks and I can tell you when you get to that place when we get to that place brothers and sisters I say Lord help me too because when we get there my goodness I I don't believe there's going to be any devil that wants to stick around here there won't be no devil that will want to be around our families no devil that will want to be in our homes or in our churches uh I believe we will just begin to see that that quick powerful work of the third poll take place in our lives maybe stand with me tonight answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters Shout to the Lord let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word because it's truth Lord we thank you that you sent a prophet Lord to take us back Lord Jesus so that we would stay straight on that word that word that Paul preached and we know that Paul said if an angel or anyone else comes and preaches another word unto you let them be accursed father we believe that we follow the word that was spoken by Paul that was spoken by Brother Branham and now father we ask that you would just help us to stay straight on that word Lord Jesus that we could see that that perfect love live out through US Lord that Divine love that would just overtake our very beings Lord that it would be the essence of Our Lives Lord Jesus that as we go forwards that the world around us would say what is it about you that we would quickly have an answer for them about the salvation that you have given us Lord that perhaps we could find that last predestinated seed in this world father we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to us Lord help us Lord Jesus to be free help us to not be bound by chains of circumstance in our own lives father help us to just recognize that we've been given a very specific instruction in our day and if we follow it we'll get the very exact results that were declared Lord we love you and we thank you tonight we pray that you would be with those who are away father those may be at work and traveling father we ask that you would keep your hand upon them that you would just bring them back home safely at the appointed time will be careful to give you all the praise Lord we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can you hear the sound from heaven like the sound of many Waters if the sound of worship
