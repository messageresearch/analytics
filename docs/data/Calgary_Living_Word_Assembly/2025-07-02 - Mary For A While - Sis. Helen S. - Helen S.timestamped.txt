[0:03] I just want to sing and thank the Lord
[0:05] for
[0:07] adding another year to me and I'm
[0:10] grateful
[0:12] [Applause]
[0:18] and my uh my request or what I aim to do
[0:23] is to never miss an opportunity with
[0:27] him.
[0:31] [Music]
[0:53] A quiet afternoon in Bony.
[0:59] [Music]
[1:01] Mary sits alone at Jesus feet.
[1:08] But in the other room,
[1:11] Martha has so much to do.
[1:15] She's missing out on fellowship sweet.
[1:20] [Music]
[1:22] And I know I could be Martha all day.
[1:29] I won't let my chance to be with him
[1:34] slip away.
[1:38] I want to be married for a while
[1:43] in all that I do.
[1:47] Close the door to everything that keeps
[1:51] my heart from him.
[1:54] Lord, I want to rest here and feel
[1:58] heaven smile.
[2:02] I want to be merry for a while.
[2:06] [Music]
[2:19] I know that I'll make Martha proud of
[2:22] me.
[2:26] with lost to do and places I must be.
[2:31] [Music]
[2:33] And yet I need this time to refresh my
[2:38] heart and mind.
[2:40] Your presence, Lord, is just what I
[2:43] need.
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] For I know I could be Martha all day
[2:54] and let my chance to be with you
[2:59] slip away.
[3:02] I want to be married for a while
[3:07] in all that I do.
[3:11] Close the door to everything that keeps
[3:15] my heart from you.
[3:18] Lord, I want to rest here and feel
[3:22] heaven smile.
[3:26] I want to be merry for a while.
[3:32] Draw me nearer.
[3:35] Draw me nearer. Precious Lord, draw me
[3:39] nearer
[3:42] to your side.
[3:46] Draw me nearer.
[3:49] Draw me nearer. Bless the Lord. Draw me
[3:54] nearer
[3:56] to your side.
[4:01] Lord, I want to rest here and feel
[4:05] heaven smile.
[4:10] I want to be married
[4:13] for a while.
[4:15] [Music]
[4:18] I want to be married
[4:23] for a while.
[4:25] [Music]
[4:28] [Applause]
