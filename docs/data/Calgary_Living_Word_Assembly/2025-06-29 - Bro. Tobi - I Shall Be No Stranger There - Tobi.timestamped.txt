[0:00] talks about when the plegator opened and
[0:06] it just occurred to me that if Jesus is
[0:10] not a stranger to you here, then you
[0:12] wouldn't be a stranger there.
[0:15] But if he's a stranger,
[0:18] then there's no opportunity.
[0:22] I pray you be blessed.
[0:24] It's my confession. I believe it's yours
[0:26] as well.
[0:29] [Music]
[0:41] When the pearl
[0:44] gates are opened
[0:47] to a sinus
[0:50] save by grace
[0:53] when through everlasting
[0:57] mercy See,
[0:59] I behold
[1:01] my Savior's face
[1:04] when I enter
[1:07] in the mansions
[1:10] of the city,
[1:12] pride and fair.
[1:15] I shall have a royal welcome,
[1:21] for I'll be no stranger there.
[1:26] I shall be no stranger.
[1:31] Jesus will my place to prepare.
[1:37] He will greet me. He will greet me. I
[1:42] shall be no stranger there.
[1:48] True times ever changing seasons.
[1:53] I am pressing
[1:55] toward the gold.
[1:58] Seize my heart. Sweet native country.
[2:03] See the homeland
[2:05] of my soul.
[2:09] Many loved ones clothed with beauty
[2:14] in those wonderous
[2:16] glorious year.
[2:19] When I rise, redeemed forgiven.
[2:24] I shall be no stranger there.
[2:29] I shall be no stranger there.
[2:34] Jesus will my place prepared.
[2:39] He will meet me. He will grace me. I
[2:44] shall be no stranger.
[2:49] Here my dear redeemer leaving
[2:54] blessed lamb upon the throne
[2:59] by the creing
[3:01] lights upon them. He will surely
[3:06] claim his own.
[3:10] So whenever
[3:11] you're sad and lonely,
[3:14] look beyond
[3:16] this friendly care.
[3:19] We reach out of God. Remember
[3:24] you will be
[3:26] no stranger there.
[3:29] I shall be no stranger there.
[3:34] Jesus has my place.
[3:39] He will meet me. He will greet me. I
[3:44] shall be no stranger.
[3:48] He will meet me. He will greet me. I
[3:54] shall meet
[3:56] no stranger.
