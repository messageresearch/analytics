[59:44] Holy
[59:48] Ground
[59:51] amen are you happy this morning amen are
[59:54] you fully surrendered
[59:56] amen we might not be but uh I hope by
[59:59] the end of the service we will fully be
[1:00:01] surrendered to him
[1:00:03] amen uh while you're standing maybe if
[1:00:05] we can read one scripture and I will let
[1:00:09] you sit and I'll just uh I have few
[1:00:13] slides this morning uh but lots of notes
[1:00:17] so maybe if we can be with me I mean uh
[1:00:22] as I put myself uh away or or set aside
[1:00:28] uh uh that God will use my lips
[1:00:32] amen I I have a little topic here little
[1:00:37] but lots you can say little is much when
[1:00:40] God is in it amen amen the bride is
[1:00:43] Christ Masterpiece this is about us
[1:00:45] right
[1:00:47] so
[1:00:48] uh that's the topic but then let's read
[1:00:51] this verse
[1:00:53] although although it's a bit uh
[1:00:56] bar brandham didn't use this uh
[1:00:58] scripture but
[1:01:00] I I was just uh led to to use this
[1:01:04] because uh Proverbs 29:18 says where
[1:01:08] there is no vision the people
[1:01:12] perish he did but he that keepeth the
[1:01:15] law happy is he amen let's bow our
[1:01:18] hearts this morning again oh Lord
[1:01:22] Jesus we ask that you have uh bless
[1:01:26] blessing amen upon the reading of your
[1:01:29] word and Lord with this little gathering
[1:01:32] we know we are full this morning oh Lord
[1:01:36] may you speak Lord just use me Lord lips
[1:01:39] of clay You Are The Potter yes I am just
[1:01:43] the clay I am just your mouthpiece this
[1:01:46] uh this morning oh Lord may you speak
[1:01:48] through me oh Lord I want to set aside
[1:01:51] myself I
[1:01:53] know it's been a while
[1:01:56] and I ask that you settle my nerves
[1:01:59] Lord and that you will speak through me
[1:02:02] and Bless the
[1:02:04] people we ask that you you'll be in
[1:02:07] control of all things now have
[1:02:09] preeminence from start to finish Jesus
[1:02:12] Christ's name we ask it amen you may be
[1:02:16] seated okay
[1:02:20] the my the thought that came to me is uh
[1:02:26] uh while while reading the Masterpiece
[1:02:29] we know some might be or most of the
[1:02:32] people here right now are believers some
[1:02:34] might not be believing this message yet
[1:02:36] but uh you know just a summary of the
[1:02:40] message we're not believing anything
[1:02:43] except Jesus Christ
[1:02:45] himself amen and uh we might be saying a
[1:02:49] lot about the quotes from BR Branham
[1:02:51] which is the message of the hour right
[1:02:55] we know the word is the
[1:02:57] absolute but the absolute is in the
[1:03:00] message of the hour amen amen so just to
[1:03:03] be clear that uh we're not
[1:03:06] cult right we believe the message of the
[1:03:09] hour which is Christ in us the hope of
[1:03:11] glory when you see each and every one of
[1:03:14] us it's Christ in brother Berry it's
[1:03:17] Christ in brother Paul their wives their
[1:03:20] families it's Christ in you amen the
[1:03:22] hope of glory so the last time I
[1:03:25] preached uh my topic was uh full
[1:03:27] restoration by the full word but then
[1:03:30] it's just like a continuation you can
[1:03:32] say uh because the bride is restored to
[1:03:37] become Christ Masterpiece amen because
[1:03:40] the first
[1:03:41] Masterpiece we know it's
[1:03:45] Adam he
[1:03:46] fell but you know Adam is not only man
[1:03:51] he's male and female he was created
[1:03:53] Created he them but then you can see
[1:03:56] that uh Adam was taken from the side of
[1:04:00] Adam he was his sman right it was
[1:04:04] preached
[1:04:05] before how come Adam uh restored Eve he
[1:04:10] has a lot of ribs why not just took
[1:04:14] a why why didn't he just take another
[1:04:17] rib there and then replace Adam or or
[1:04:19] replace Eve but he he didn't do that he
[1:04:23] loved ad uh Eve so much that uh he
[1:04:26] wanted to restore her amen amen amen but
[1:04:30] you know that uh the fall came when F
[1:04:35] didn't come when when Eve was in Adam
[1:04:38] that's right amen but then when she oh
[1:04:41] when he was
[1:04:42] smitten and Eve was a separate being
[1:04:46] then that's the time she fell but
[1:04:49] because of Love
[1:04:50] knowingly right just I'm giving a
[1:04:53] background here that uh the Masterpiece
[1:04:56] of God is a masterpiece a masterpiece
[1:04:59] family amen it cannot be complete
[1:05:02] without a bride and a bridegroom amen so
[1:05:05] that's why uh we'll continue uh the the
[1:05:10] previous uh the next slide please just a
[1:05:13] summary of what uh we have uh talked
[1:05:16] about last last time I know this is a
[1:05:18] busy slide but it has a lot of nuggets
[1:05:21] in it and it Encompass the whole message
[1:05:24] of the hour and it's a St nature of a
[1:05:26] perfect man right and to be perfect we
[1:05:29] know it goes through process but then
[1:05:33] it's a whole thing it's not partial once
[1:05:36] you receive the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:05:38] sealed you're sealed right amen don't be
[1:05:42] don't be uh uh uh tossed to and fro
[1:05:46] thinking that you don't have the Holy
[1:05:47] Ghost where in fact you have it amen
[1:05:50] because in simple terms what's the
[1:05:52] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:53] you have the ability to receive the word
[1:05:57] for your day remember that for your day
[1:06:00] because it's not the most uh it's not
[1:06:02] the word of Moses that will lead us to
[1:06:05] Perfection or to
[1:06:07] Rapture it's not the words of Moses it's
[1:06:10] not the words of David it's not the
[1:06:12] words of the prophets previous prophets
[1:06:14] but we have the word for our day that's
[1:06:17] the reason why we believe what we
[1:06:18] believe amen because it's present tense
[1:06:22] word of the hour amen it will lead to uh
[1:06:25] to Perfection amen so you can see here
[1:06:27] it's
[1:06:28] a it's a stature stature of a perfect
[1:06:32] man amen and uh it goes through a
[1:06:34] process until Jesus and the bride will
[1:06:37] be
[1:06:39] one right so so next slide thinking
[1:06:45] thinking that uh uh so that we can thank
[1:06:48] the Lord Our God for his grace and mercy
[1:06:52] you can
[1:06:53] see from eternity to Eternity
[1:06:56] what does the mind of God uh what is the
[1:06:59] mind of God basically you can see here
[1:07:01] from eternity to Eternity we are put
[1:07:04] into time amen so just uh giving a
[1:07:07] background here next slide please I
[1:07:09] didn't have the clicker so you can see
[1:07:11] eternity is like a circle right it has
[1:07:15] no end and no beginning right this just
[1:07:18] a background I know you have seen this
[1:07:19] but uh not many people have seen it so
[1:07:22] might be beneficial but then you see the
[1:07:24] word is always fresh
[1:07:26] right when we when we preach it although
[1:07:28] we have seen it oh I've seen that but
[1:07:30] then when when it's being tackled in
[1:07:32] detail we would know that it's important
[1:07:35] and we we might know the message of the
[1:07:36] hour 1200 tapes 1200 messages but then
[1:07:39] how come the pastor still preaching here
[1:07:41] how come ministers are still preaching
[1:07:43] here is to bring us to remembrance amen
[1:07:46] because Christian Living is what feeding
[1:07:49] the word prayer worship giving adoration
[1:07:52] to to our Lord Jesus Christ and knowing
[1:07:54] who we are and fellowship with one
[1:07:55] another amen so many things so just as a
[1:07:59] background here in the mind of Jesus or
[1:08:02] or or God right uh be before even time
[1:08:06] began he you know he's not even God
[1:08:09] right he's an object of worship God
[1:08:11] means object of worship but nobody uh
[1:08:14] will worship him because in the
[1:08:16] beginning he was Elohim self-existing
[1:08:18] one right so in his mind he has the
[1:08:23] attribute that he wanted to manifest in
[1:08:25] each and every one of us that's right
[1:08:27] the the main thing there is he wanted to
[1:08:29] be a Healer or or or he the first he
[1:08:33] wanted to be God but God is an object of
[1:08:35] worship so our prophet of God said he
[1:08:37] created angels first so that somebody
[1:08:41] will will worship him right but then he
[1:08:44] he saw
[1:08:46] alone right so he wanted to have a
[1:08:48] companion amen so he wanted to have
[1:08:52] someone to fellowship with that's why he
[1:08:55] created man but he not only man but man
[1:08:58] in his own image amen but then
[1:09:02] man you know man you me we cannot even
[1:09:08] uh uh keep our covenants right right
[1:09:14] because we're human
[1:09:16] beings we are born and shaping iniquity
[1:09:19] born speaking lies right we cannot even
[1:09:22] do that so what did God do he he put an
[1:09:26] unconditional Covenant through Abraham
[1:09:29] amen amen
[1:09:31] whether whether you're a sinner or not
[1:09:34] sinner as long as you you accept him as
[1:09:37] your lord savior healer bridegroom then
[1:09:40] you can be saved you can be redeemed
[1:09:42] amen so the fall you can see here before
[1:09:47] it's eternity right Adam and Eve in the
[1:09:49] Garden of Eden talking lip to ear having
[1:09:54] Fellowship in the cool of the evening
[1:09:57] right but then fall came so you can see
[1:10:00] the first thing here is eternity is like
[1:10:03] a A Perfect Circle has no beginning has
[1:10:07] has no end but then the next
[1:10:10] slide time came because of sin time
[1:10:13] means although it's very long time it's
[1:10:15] still time right Millennium it might be
[1:10:19] a thousand years but still time it's a
[1:10:21] time element but then that's not our
[1:10:24] goal only is to be in the Millennium no
[1:10:26] we want to be in eternity right because
[1:10:29] Millennium there will be some people
[1:10:31] there bar Bram said that there will be
[1:10:34] hens there and even the Bible said that
[1:10:36] right there will be hens in the
[1:10:38] Millennium but how would they go that's
[1:10:39] not the topic here but uh the point
[1:10:41] there is time came because of sin but
[1:10:45] then how can you be
[1:10:46] back to Eternity
[1:10:50] again it's because of Jesus
[1:10:53] blood right it breeds the Gap so that
[1:10:57] you can come back to
[1:10:59] Eternity again right so simple simple
[1:11:03] thing in a in a graphic form or uh you
[1:11:08] can say presentation form so that it can
[1:11:10] can be uh instilled in our minds one
[1:11:13] picture paints a thousand world uh words
[1:11:15] they're saying right so although we we
[1:11:18] speak a lot of words without uh without
[1:11:20] picture sometimes we we typically forget
[1:11:22] but then for those who who didn't accept
[1:11:25] Jesus Christ yet when when we try to
[1:11:28] evangelize or or or witness to someone
[1:11:31] we know that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:11:33] still bleeding yes still effective and
[1:11:36] it is it Encompass everyone amen right
[1:11:39] so it's not only for believers of this
[1:11:41] message which is full Believers you can
[1:11:44] say uh we don't follow a man we follow
[1:11:47] the god of that man amen just to be
[1:11:50] clear on that okay uh the next uh slide
[1:11:53] uh
[1:11:55] just to prove the point there that uh
[1:11:57] it's a quote all right past the old
[1:11:59] Sabbath is passed Jesus raised on the
[1:12:02] eighth day that was a solemn day holy
[1:12:05] and it wasn't a day cuz day A Time had
[1:12:08] done run run out it passed into eternity
[1:12:12] see it Swang right back to the first day
[1:12:15] again so with that picture you can see
[1:12:18] it's a ring we are in time very long
[1:12:21] time but then we will go back to
[1:12:23] Eternity so eternity is like a ring you
[1:12:26] can't find no corner to it you can't
[1:12:29] find no stopping place in A Perfect
[1:12:30] Circle you go on and on I don't care how
[1:12:34] far you go you're still going you can
[1:12:36] start going around like this go through
[1:12:39] the floor go through the Earth go beyond
[1:12:41] the Earth you're still go so you can see
[1:12:44] based on that uh coat as well and even
[1:12:47] with a proper when when I see a ring
[1:12:49] here there's a it's very symbolic right
[1:12:53] uh the the picture of uh or or you can
[1:12:57] say the the backdrop of uh sister Marian
[1:13:01] uh Marian and brother tabo's wedding at
[1:13:04] Barber's places there are two rings that
[1:13:06] are
[1:13:07] interconnected so that's a sign of
[1:13:10] Eternity actually because that's
[1:13:12] Infinity amen right and the Ring The
[1:13:15] Ring represents Circle there's a purpose
[1:13:17] in it right there's a symbolic
[1:13:19] significance on it that that our God
[1:13:23] wanted us to be with him Amen in
[1:13:26] eternity we know it's a process marriage
[1:13:30] you can say it's a process right
[1:13:33] engagement right
[1:13:35] consumation
[1:13:37] honeymoon uh and then living together so
[1:13:41] I think uh brotheris and sister Marian
[1:13:43] has already gone with the honeymoon so
[1:13:45] they are now living together this is the
[1:13:47] real life now being husband and wife
[1:13:50] right living together so you will see
[1:13:51] you're not in hanimon anymore so it's uh
[1:13:54] knowing each other
[1:13:55] right so it didn't stop with
[1:13:59] honeymoon it's living together right now
[1:14:03] so why why why do I want uh or how maybe
[1:14:08] let's go to the next slide so that you
[1:14:09] can see
[1:14:11] here I I I've have taken the the thought
[1:14:13] here from from the two services from bar
[1:14:15] brandham which is the Masterpiece
[1:14:17] Masterpiece in uh when was that
[1:14:21] uh 1964 July 5th the Masterpiece and
[1:14:25] 1964 December 5th the identified
[1:14:27] Masterpiece of God they're pretty
[1:14:29] similar messages but uh uh yeah uh and
[1:14:34] they have a little bit of a different
[1:14:35] title but they're talking the same thing
[1:14:37] amen you can see it's uh in his
[1:14:41] background in in that sto in in that
[1:14:44] message is the Masterpiece of
[1:14:46] Michelangelo you know Michelangelo is a
[1:14:49] is an artist right and one of his
[1:14:53] masterpieces is the sculpture of Moses
[1:14:56] and BR Branham was saying that uh uh
[1:15:00] being an artist he has the vision first
[1:15:03] on what he wanted to do he wanted to to
[1:15:06] sculpt the Moses basically that is the
[1:15:11] thing he wanted to do so you can see as
[1:15:14] he
[1:15:15] progressed being an artist and being
[1:15:18] human you see the process right his
[1:15:21] vision first came that's why without
[1:15:23] Vision you will perish anything that you
[1:15:25] will do on uh in here uh which will be
[1:15:29] like a workshop later on I'll I'll do
[1:15:32] that anything that we want to do it must
[1:15:33] start with a vision amen hallelujah it
[1:15:36] must start from our mind amen so we will
[1:15:38] be the Mastermind of what we want to
[1:15:41] what we want to do and uh we know in a
[1:15:45] project in a project if I can put it a
[1:15:49] little bit different uh like a like a
[1:15:51] testimony in in doing projects like what
[1:15:54] I'm been doing the past 29 years 30
[1:15:58] years there's a there's a vision or
[1:16:02] there's a purpose of what you want to
[1:16:04] achieve first it's it didn't come when
[1:16:07] okay I'll do this let's see what
[1:16:09] happens it's the end from the beginning
[1:16:11] it's always we we have a lot of Builders
[1:16:13] here Paul Barry Sister Lisa sister Ela B
[1:16:18] Dan they they they know a project means
[1:16:21] there's a beginning and an end but it's
[1:16:24] the end first first that you need to
[1:16:27] know so that you can start from the
[1:16:30] beginning right so there's a we're so
[1:16:33] thankful from eternity to Eternity so
[1:16:37] God's mind he wanted a bride of his own
[1:16:40] choosing amen right he want to create a
[1:16:43] man in his own image right that's his
[1:16:46] vision in a project for example I I'll
[1:16:49] put it home I I hope it's okay somebody
[1:16:51] might not know me but uh uh but just so
[1:16:55] that you can see that it's real thing so
[1:16:58] we have a project it's to produce oil
[1:17:00] just to simp simplify produce oil here
[1:17:02] in Alberta so we were given a mandate
[1:17:06] okay we want to produce 125,000 Barrel
[1:17:08] per day of oil so okay so now that is
[1:17:12] given as a project Charter what do you
[1:17:14] need to do now of course you have to
[1:17:16] start from the beginning you have to
[1:17:18] plan you have to you know uh check your
[1:17:20] resources is it technically feasible is
[1:17:23] it financially feasible
[1:17:25] right all those things you need to to
[1:17:27] check whether this is feasible or not
[1:17:30] but the thing is okay how come our
[1:17:34] company was able to ask for that Charter
[1:17:37] to produce 125,000 Barrel per day first
[1:17:40] thing is do you have the financial cap
[1:17:42] capability right
[1:17:45] because even though it's technically
[1:17:47] feasible because in with God nothing is
[1:17:50] impossible amen but there is feasibility
[1:17:53] right uh but in the natural world world
[1:17:55] there's some limitations do you have the
[1:17:57] money okay oh there's money oh now do
[1:18:00] you do you have the technical knowledge
[1:18:02] to do it right you will have you will
[1:18:05] place all the people that will be part
[1:18:07] of that project and then then that's the
[1:18:11] execution phase right and then at the
[1:18:13] end of the day are you going to produce
[1:18:15] 125 uh th000 Barrel per day that's the
[1:18:18] end so it means once you achieve that
[1:18:21] then your project is successful because
[1:18:24] your vision
[1:18:25] your purpose of o of of that project is
[1:18:29] achieved amen so let's put it in Michael
[1:18:32] Angelos uh or or uh
[1:18:37] uh sculpture at first he wanted Moses to
[1:18:41] be sculpt right and then during the
[1:18:45] execution what what does he need he
[1:18:47] needs marble he needs materials he need
[1:18:50] the Chisel hammer and most importantly
[1:18:53] his time right right hard work right so
[1:18:59] upon doing it says bra Bram was saying
[1:19:02] he did it for many many years I don't
[1:19:05] know how many years but then he did that
[1:19:07] day in day out but then he had a vision
[1:19:11] I want to I want to sculpt the Moses
[1:19:15] basically right but then upon doing this
[1:19:19] and thinking about his vision he doesn't
[1:19:21] have any uh picture of Moses brother
[1:19:24] brandham was saying I don't think uh
[1:19:26] Moses there there might not be cameras
[1:19:28] at that time right so so in his mind
[1:19:32] Moses might look like this so he did day
[1:19:34] in day out hard work but then when he
[1:19:38] finally shaped
[1:19:41] it with this Vision he was thinking wow
[1:19:45] it's a
[1:19:47] beautiful sculpture he considered it
[1:19:50] Masterpiece of himself but then the
[1:19:52] thing is his vision is even more than
[1:19:54] that he thought that it's so real that
[1:19:57] his might smitten the his knee BR banam
[1:20:02] was saying that made it the Masterpiece
[1:20:04] because when you checked it you can see
[1:20:06] the the the little there right uh this
[1:20:10] one is just from from the internet so
[1:20:13] you can see it but I don't know if this
[1:20:15] is it but it's just to represent whether
[1:20:17] it's true or not yeah you I think you
[1:20:19] got the picture so you can see he did it
[1:20:24] and then he Smite it he he I don't know
[1:20:28] the past tense of that sorry I'm not an
[1:20:31] English person so but anyway it was his
[1:20:33] smen right and then that made it the
[1:20:36] Masterpiece that's why when bar Branham
[1:20:38] went there he just checked it and wow
[1:20:41] and everyone is there but then the
[1:20:44] Masterpiece being the Masterpiece is
[1:20:46] must it must be put on a
[1:20:48] pedestal right so that's why I
[1:20:50] represented it that way so that you can
[1:20:52] see that it's on a foundation so that we
[1:20:54] we can see you don't put a candle under
[1:20:58] a bushel right if if if it is a light
[1:21:00] you have to put it up so that it can
[1:21:02] shed or or it can uh uh emit more light
[1:21:06] amen so it's it's like a masterpiece
[1:21:08] when it's a masterpiece you want to put
[1:21:10] it in a beautiful place amen amen so
[1:21:14] next uh slide uh 11 okay that's good we
[1:21:18] have time we have still have one
[1:21:23] hour amen so the Masterpiece of God just
[1:21:27] uh to put it so that at least Barberry
[1:21:29] has a little bit of there because
[1:21:30] there's no in between right between the
[1:21:33] foundation that's right the brotherly
[1:21:35] kindness and the love there should not
[1:21:37] be any but then it's like that put on a
[1:21:41] foundation on top of each other no
[1:21:43] mortar in between amen right until it is
[1:21:47] full
[1:21:48] sture right so in I I I suggest you you
[1:21:53] read the the master oh I mean listen to
[1:21:55] the Masterpiece those
[1:21:57] two uh two messages they're
[1:22:02] great right I'm just putting in one
[1:22:04] slide here what what it meant to me
[1:22:08] there's a lot of it we're trying to
[1:22:11] break things into pieces amen right uh
[1:22:13] because in a project if you think so
[1:22:15] much of it and you don't break it into
[1:22:18] little
[1:22:18] pieces it cannot be achievable that's
[1:22:21] why we break things we call it work
[1:22:23] breakdown system them right so so that
[1:22:26] everything that you will do can be done
[1:22:29] and there should be an owner of every
[1:22:31] task is the same as this church right
[1:22:34] amen that's right bar Barberry cannot do
[1:22:37] all right bra Paul cannot do all we need
[1:22:40] each other brothers and sisters we have
[1:22:41] a part in this body amen we have to
[1:22:44] break it down into little pieces based
[1:22:46] on our capability and the gifts that is
[1:22:49] placed in us right and and uh and you
[1:22:53] know as a whole will be a whole
[1:22:55] Masterpiece amen amen we might be in
[1:22:59] this local body right and it was
[1:23:02] preached last
[1:23:03] Wednesday the the shepherd and the Sheep
[1:23:07] right in a mystical body we know the
[1:23:09] shepherd is Jesus Christ right right and
[1:23:12] the ship is many member body in
[1:23:14] different churches but in a local body
[1:23:17] the shepherd here is the pastor we have
[1:23:19] to respect that office no matter who he
[1:23:21] is amen amen there's a
[1:23:25] there is a an authority there Spiritual
[1:23:28] Authority we're not following a man
[1:23:30] right right it's important to understand
[1:23:32] that we have to respect that Authority
[1:23:35] because if we are not under subjection
[1:23:37] of any Authority who are we believing
[1:23:40] right so what I'm saying here is we are
[1:23:43] part of that body everyone is a part of
[1:23:46] this body so just summarizing what the
[1:23:49] Masterpiece of God the message is he
[1:23:52] said he said at first his first
[1:23:55] Masterpiece is
[1:23:57] uh Adam he created man in his own image
[1:24:01] and then he was put to to uh sleep and
[1:24:05] then he was also smitten the first uh
[1:24:09] surgery that happened and then uh in in
[1:24:12] this world basically according to the
[1:24:15] Bible and then uh Eve came out
[1:24:18] of uh from the man which is Adam that's
[1:24:21] why it's called woman womb of a man man
[1:24:24] right out of the womb of a man just uh
[1:24:27] so that it's easy to to understand that
[1:24:29] it came from the womb of a man that's
[1:24:31] why it's a w a woman it's called woman
[1:24:33] and he named her Eve right so the
[1:24:37] Masterpiece because of uh at first it's
[1:24:41] so perfect he put them into Garden of
[1:24:43] Eden that's where he placed them same
[1:24:46] for for for the Masterpiece of
[1:24:48] Michelangelo it was put on a pedestal
[1:24:51] right but uh bar Branham he put it he
[1:24:54] narrated it in a way that uh the
[1:24:57] foundation is based on the Patriarchs
[1:25:00] amen right of
[1:25:03] Abraham which is Faith father of faith
[1:25:06] and
[1:25:07] Isaac love Jacob mercy and Joseph
[1:25:14] Perfection if you will read the message
[1:25:16] the Masterpiece you will find it so
[1:25:18] beautiful how he put it there amen amen
[1:25:22] but then the thing is it didn't stop
[1:25:23] there that's just the
[1:25:25] foundation amen but then the the point
[1:25:28] there is how it came to have a
[1:25:31] unconditional Covenant as compared to uh
[1:25:34] conditional one because in the beginning
[1:25:37] thou shal not do this it's a dos and
[1:25:39] don'ts right he commanded uh Adam not to
[1:25:44] eat the fruit thereof of of that three
[1:25:47] of the threee of knowledge of Good and
[1:25:49] Evil that's a commandment it means don't
[1:25:51] do this don't do that right if you don't
[1:25:54] do this then you will have eternal life
[1:25:56] but if you do this you will you will you
[1:25:58] know uh against it you will you will
[1:26:01] fall so it's conditional but then God
[1:26:05] found out thatth man really we're
[1:26:08] hard-headed
[1:26:09] right I I'm the most hard-headed person
[1:26:12] you can say but then the thing is
[1:26:14] because of the grace of God he puts us
[1:26:16] in
[1:26:17] L and yeah you might you might be better
[1:26:21] Christian than me but uh the good thing
[1:26:24] is uh we are we want to be subjected
[1:26:26] with the word amen and uh with that he
[1:26:31] put because of his love for for his
[1:26:34] Masterpiece he wanted to restore yes
[1:26:37] sure right and and then he put that
[1:26:40] Restoration in a process
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:45] so you can see the foundation is based
[1:26:48] on Abraham which is Faith Isaac love
[1:26:51] Jacob mercy and Joseph Perfection so it
[1:26:53] means you cannot put something on a
[1:26:55] pedestal when your pedestal itself or
[1:26:57] your foundation is not right amen
[1:27:00] anything that you build right if it's is
[1:27:03] if the foundation is wrong you cannot do
[1:27:06] it it will just collapse we have just a
[1:27:09] story here uh something coming up so
[1:27:12] bear with me here I'll just share and I
[1:27:14] I want to relax you know brother
[1:27:16] brandham the the uh the message the
[1:27:20] identified Masterpiece he he the second
[1:27:23] one
[1:27:24] he uh he preach it after three months
[1:27:27] more than three months so that is his
[1:27:30] first time he's saying that uh he's been
[1:27:32] out of the pulpit for three months and
[1:27:34] then he was nervous so I'm nervous too
[1:27:36] because uh so bear with me I just want
[1:27:40] to be relaxed because I know we're
[1:27:42] brothers and sisters and if I say
[1:27:44] something that is wrong forgive me in
[1:27:46] the first place but I just want to feel
[1:27:49] relaxed and then the Lord can can use
[1:27:51] this uh presentation here so in this
[1:27:56] Foundation it must be perfect so it
[1:27:59] based on you can see it he didn't
[1:28:03] put do you have the clicker brother I
[1:28:06] mean uh so that I
[1:28:10] can it is
[1:28:15] here no I mean the the pointer maybe
[1:28:20] just so at least it's not difficult
[1:28:27] yeah so you can see
[1:28:31] here he didn't
[1:28:33] put he didn't put the Masterpiece on
[1:28:37] Abraham because Abraham is not
[1:28:40] perfect right nobody's perfect but then
[1:28:42] the thing is in terms of their
[1:28:45] uh uh sorry I'll just put this year
[1:28:56] okay now it's good so you can see here
[1:28:59] the first one is
[1:29:00] Abraham right he didn't put right away
[1:29:04] the Masterpiece on top of Abraham he has
[1:29:07] to go through a a process here and it's
[1:29:10] by the Patriarchs and Isaac we know is
[1:29:14] the next because he's he's uh portrayed
[1:29:18] us uh father of Love here by BR Bram
[1:29:20] because uh uh it's like Abraham being
[1:29:23] God and then he wanted to
[1:29:25] sacrifice Isaac right it's it's the same
[1:29:29] as God wanted to sacrifice Christ right
[1:29:32] Jesus Christ for our Salvation amen so
[1:29:34] he's a god of he is the father of love
[1:29:37] and then Jacob Mercy because he's a
[1:29:39] deceiver so we are all born in born in
[1:29:43] sin safe and iniquity that's why we need
[1:29:45] Mercy right we need Grace from the Lord
[1:29:49] right because Faith cometh by hearing
[1:29:51] but then it's not by our works so
[1:29:54] righteousness but by his grace alone
[1:29:56] that's why we cannot say we know the
[1:29:57] message of the hour that's why I'll be
[1:29:59] saved it's not knowledge brothers and
[1:30:01] sisters right we know it's Revelation
[1:30:03] and it's a life amen and then come
[1:30:06] Joseph Joseph we know his story he's
[1:30:09] just like a perfect person whatever he
[1:30:11] touches it prospers right but then the
[1:30:15] thing is the only uh floww of Joseph
[1:30:19] here bar Bram is saying and I checked it
[1:30:21] in the Bible is when he said that uh uh
[1:30:24] because he's the is the right hand of
[1:30:26] pharaoh right he's the governor of Egypt
[1:30:29] and then he wanted his family the whole
[1:30:31] family to come to to Egypt and then he
[1:30:34] told them specifically tell the phoh
[1:30:38] that you are cattle Racers right right
[1:30:42] not uh so that uh but in fact they are
[1:30:46] they are uh they've been uh uh you know
[1:30:50] uh cattle cattle Racers anyhow because I
[1:30:53] checked the he I did Joseph really told
[1:30:58] the LIE right did he did he tell a lie
[1:31:01] no he he didn't but then the thing is
[1:31:03] strategically he said he wanted the
[1:31:06] family to tell them to to uh to be
[1:31:09] cattle Racers rather than Shepherds so
[1:31:12] that they can be put in a special place
[1:31:15] which is gosan because in the mind of
[1:31:18] Joseph he didn't want them to be
[1:31:19] mingling right with the Egyptians so
[1:31:22] they were in gsan right they were
[1:31:24] because they are cattle Racers so that's
[1:31:27] the only thing bar branam is saying that
[1:31:29] uh that is not perfect in Joseph but
[1:31:32] then he has a good intention and uh he
[1:31:34] didn't tell a lie right but he didn't
[1:31:37] say exactly that they are Shepherds uh
[1:31:39] or they are Shepherds because shepherds
[1:31:41] are
[1:31:42] Abomination among Egyptians and I
[1:31:45] checked also why they are Abominations
[1:31:47] there are so many things they're saying
[1:31:48] because oh farming is a low low class uh
[1:31:52] work uh because they they are nomadic
[1:31:55] people and so on and so forth what but
[1:31:57] whatever it is whatever the reason it's
[1:31:58] an Abomination to the Egyptians because
[1:32:01] the word says so right I I I don't want
[1:32:03] to I don't want to think otherwise
[1:32:05] because the word says so so so be it
[1:32:07] right because if we believe that the
[1:32:09] word is the absolute and if it says
[1:32:11] whether we we know it or not we'll just
[1:32:14] accept it we'll just believe it amen so
[1:32:17] so what happened there is Joseph is
[1:32:20] considered perfect foundation and then
[1:32:23] br Branham said let's see I think uh
[1:32:26] it's in in the quote here let's uh you
[1:32:30] can see I want to show you here that
[1:32:32] after
[1:32:33] Joseph the restoration comes through the
[1:32:37] prophets and these prophets are we know
[1:32:40] a lot of prophets Moses David Elijah
[1:32:44] John the Baptist BR Branham and the
[1:32:47] bride why is the bride
[1:32:49] here in this uh in this level here or in
[1:32:53] this class
[1:32:54] which is called the body BR Bram was
[1:32:56] saying that as as the body let me let me
[1:32:59] just check it I think it is in
[1:33:02] 59 uh maybe if you can I didn't put the
[1:33:06] the thing here in the Masterpiece
[1:33:07] brother 1964 July
[1:33:10] 5th bear with me
[1:33:12] here I just want to put this as a as a
[1:33:17] foundation in our discussion
[1:33:22] here uh uh okay bear with me okay
[1:33:28] okay amen the body
[1:33:37] okay okay right with me here it'll be
[1:33:46] there okay sorry about that I will I'll
[1:33:51] just uh okay
[1:33:57] anyhow while while I'm looking for it
[1:34:00] brother brandham is saying before Christ
[1:34:04] came to be the perfect Masterpiece the
[1:34:07] body was uh was formed by prophets right
[1:34:11] uh I have the the quote there but uh
[1:34:14] cannot find it here but it's there while
[1:34:16] while we're looking for it what does
[1:34:18] that mean so it
[1:34:20] means we are given this word
[1:34:24] which is the word of God we are not God
[1:34:27] but the word of God through US amen and
[1:34:29] we have believed all throughout the days
[1:34:32] even in the Old Testament that the word
[1:34:34] of God comes through prophets right and
[1:34:37] then that's the reason why we believe
[1:34:38] what we believe we believe that God sent
[1:34:40] Malachi 4 right 5 and six to be the
[1:34:43] Prophet Elijah for this day the
[1:34:45] forthcoming of Elijah and then he handed
[1:34:49] over to us a message that will what that
[1:34:54] will that we will prophesy again so just
[1:34:57] just want to read that uh I'll
[1:35:03] uh amen it's it's it's so important to
[1:35:07] to understand that uh that uh we were
[1:35:10] given this
[1:35:11] message is not to be only staying here
[1:35:14] and and be fed all throughout there is
[1:35:18] an action that is required from us am
[1:35:20] because the thing is he said in in
[1:35:23] Revelation 10 11 to 12 brother if if we
[1:35:26] can read it uh so that at least
[1:35:30] uh amen we can put a good uh foundation
[1:35:33] on
[1:35:36] it Revelations 10
[1:35:50] 11-2 yeah you can open it I think yeah
[1:35:53] well
[1:35:54] while we're
[1:36:02] waiting okay and he said unto
[1:36:06] me thou must prophesy again before many
[1:36:10] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:36:13] Kings amen so and then 11:12 uh uh verse
[1:36:19] 12 is okay that that that's it right so
[1:36:22] yeah okay so there is a there is a
[1:36:26] require uh there is an action that we
[1:36:28] need to do here we don't only need to
[1:36:31] feed the word accept the message and
[1:36:33] then you know live happily ever after
[1:36:36] without doing anything because the thing
[1:36:38] is the message of the hour is so full
[1:36:41] that it was tked to us so that we can
[1:36:44] feed it and then when full when we are
[1:36:46] full of it we have to share it amen
[1:36:49] because we need to impart eternal life
[1:36:51] what BR Bram is saying is a greater work
[1:36:54] we might let's say we want to get
[1:36:57] married right if that's our purpose
[1:37:00] let's say right we're talking about
[1:37:02] Masterpiece uh I have uh different
[1:37:04] examples here if we want to get married
[1:37:08] that's our vision right being young
[1:37:10] young man for example our vision is okay
[1:37:13] I will have a great family that is
[1:37:15] serving the lord financially stable all
[1:37:19] these things and whatnot that's the
[1:37:21] vision of typical man typical young man
[1:37:24] amen so to make that happen you have to
[1:37:28] do some actions too right you have to
[1:37:30] plan you have to plan but then the thing
[1:37:32] is your your vision is to have a good
[1:37:35] life who who doesn't want good life here
[1:37:38] amen we we we want all good life we want
[1:37:41] to be all financially stable all our
[1:37:44] children uh serving the lord all our uh
[1:37:48] uh loved ones amen amen that's a very
[1:37:51] good uh very good desire but then let's
[1:37:54] come to the point let's say I'm a young
[1:37:56] man and I wanted to marry a uh to to
[1:37:58] marry to get married so the action I
[1:38:02] just want to put it into three things
[1:38:04] Vision action and result okay Vision
[1:38:07] First my vision is to get married right
[1:38:11] if I want to get married what's the
[1:38:12] action that I will take of course I have
[1:38:14] to look for a bride right also right the
[1:38:17] bride to be so that's one of the actions
[1:38:20] so I have to have the Holy Ghost because
[1:38:22] the prophet of God said uh you must have
[1:38:25] the Holy Ghost before you you get
[1:38:27] married right and then all this
[1:38:31] checklist right but then the thing is
[1:38:33] I've been telling when when you you're
[1:38:36] full with the word of God then you
[1:38:38] wanted to impart it that's right right
[1:38:40] right so the thing is whoever your bride
[1:38:43] is if your
[1:38:45] vision you wanted it to manifest as
[1:38:48] you've envisioned it then you have to do
[1:38:51] the proper actions amen you have to
[1:38:53] follow the instructions in the message
[1:38:55] of the hour right because uh uh the
[1:38:59] prophet of God will not give us any
[1:39:01] instruction that will not be good for us
[1:39:03] amen because he said if I'm telling you
[1:39:06] something that is out of the word forget
[1:39:08] about it that's right his ministry will
[1:39:11] be in vain if he will not put us back in
[1:39:13] line with the word but then the thing is
[1:39:15] something can happen within that action
[1:39:18] but you wanted it to be perfect so you
[1:39:20] have to do the right action you have to
[1:39:22] work on it work on our own if if if we
[1:39:25] need the Holy Ghost let's make it simple
[1:39:27] we have little kids here what's the
[1:39:29] evidence of the Holy Ghost you have the
[1:39:31] ability to receive the word for your day
[1:39:33] okay how can you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:39:36] it says repent because we are all
[1:39:38] sinners and be baptized how the right
[1:39:41] baptism be baptized with the the name of
[1:39:44] the not the name of the father Son and
[1:39:46] Holy Spirit which is the Lord Jesus
[1:39:48] Christ be baptized in the name of the
[1:39:50] Lord Jesus Christ right because the
[1:39:52] father is is is uh the Lord the name of
[1:39:56] the father son holy spirit is the Lord
[1:39:58] Jesus Christ so we we might think it's
[1:40:01] uh trinitarian no it's not right the
[1:40:04] compound name of of God is the Lord
[1:40:07] Jesus Christ I don't know why I went
[1:40:08] there but uh anyway amen so but the
[1:40:11] point there is you repent that's the
[1:40:13] first step because we're all Sinners yes
[1:40:16] everyone here we all we are all sinners
[1:40:19] no no no one is excused that's the
[1:40:20] reason why we need the blood of Jesus
[1:40:22] Christ so so that we can be saved but
[1:40:25] how can you how can you say that uh uh
[1:40:29] you you can be saved by not repenting
[1:40:31] right so repenting means it will change
[1:40:33] your mind amen and it will change your
[1:40:36] action right change your heart and
[1:40:38] change your action so first it will
[1:40:40] change your mind that's the number one
[1:40:42] step right when you repent once you
[1:40:44] change your mind then your heart will be
[1:40:47] also change it will be turned towards
[1:40:49] doing the right thing and then that
[1:40:52] chain of heart will manifest in your in
[1:40:54] the chains of action amen so that's why
[1:40:56] Christianity is life it's not a ritual
[1:40:59] it's not coming to church only during
[1:41:02] Sundays and Wednesdays and even prayer
[1:41:04] meetings or even worship Services it's
[1:41:07] life it's in it's instilled in our lives
[1:41:11] right right it has been said you know uh
[1:41:15] uh priorities change they said right
[1:41:18] amen but values don't that's right so
[1:41:21] being Christians we have common dyam
[1:41:23] Ator brothers and sisters we want to be
[1:41:25] we want to please the Lord we want to
[1:41:28] Worship the Lord we want to praise the
[1:41:30] Lord amen and even in worshiping I will
[1:41:32] say here can I preach a little bit yeah
[1:41:35] I just want to talk about worship we
[1:41:38] talk we think of worship it's only
[1:41:39] singing no there are other forms of
[1:41:42] worship and the most important one also
[1:41:44] is
[1:41:45] giving giving means giving everything to
[1:41:49] God amen amen right even titing for
[1:41:52] example we want to to be blessed right
[1:41:54] we want to be financially stable if if
[1:41:55] that's our vision to be financially
[1:41:58] stable then let's do what is required to
[1:42:00] be financially stable what are the
[1:42:05] requirements right in being financially
[1:42:07] stable number one is pay your tights
[1:42:10] amen why is why it is said as paying
[1:42:13] tights because it's not yours right you
[1:42:17] have to pay it back you have to give it
[1:42:19] back to the Lord because everything
[1:42:21] belongs to him amen it's not because we
[1:42:23] work so hard that's why I'm only giving
[1:42:26] this much no tights means 10% anything
[1:42:30] above that is an
[1:42:31] offering right but the tithes it's
[1:42:35] payment right although we're bringing it
[1:42:38] it's not asking you to to give uh or or
[1:42:42] or or or or to render but it he is
[1:42:45] asking for what is his it is his in the
[1:42:48] beginning amen amen so to be financially
[1:42:52] stable you have to do all those things
[1:42:55] right so so my point here is everything
[1:42:59] that we
[1:43:00] envision right we want to do it in a
[1:43:04] small piece we want to to break it down
[1:43:07] so that it's achievable amen I was
[1:43:09] thinking about let's say we want to
[1:43:12] finish a biking track the the bikers uh
[1:43:15] yesterday I guess or or the hikers they
[1:43:17] want to hike or bike uh on a certain
[1:43:20] place where they want it might be a
[1:43:22] little bit difficult or what so their
[1:43:24] vision is to finish that
[1:43:27] track right they want to finish
[1:43:30] successfully but doing that before doing
[1:43:32] that they have to prepare so what do I
[1:43:35] need to finish that track oh my bicycle
[1:43:38] must be good right I must have the skill
[1:43:41] to do biking if you don't know how to
[1:43:43] bike how can you run the Tru right so it
[1:43:45] means you have to have the skill to have
[1:43:47] that first right what do I need I need
[1:43:49] food right I need uh oh where will I
[1:43:52] park lots of planning before that would
[1:43:54] happen amen that's part of the action
[1:43:57] that you need to do right but once
[1:43:59] you're successful that's the result of
[1:44:02] what you have envisioned so now let's
[1:44:05] say a young person wanted to be good in
[1:44:07] mathematics for example I I'm putting
[1:44:10] small breakdowns here of of something
[1:44:12] achievable oh let's say I want to have
[1:44:14] 100% uh average in
[1:44:17] mathematics right so let's say maybe may
[1:44:22] maybe I think I has 100 I guess so maybe
[1:44:25] let's say he envisioned that I want
[1:44:29] 100% uh mathema uh average in my in my
[1:44:32] mathematics class or course so can he do
[1:44:36] that by just
[1:44:38] biking can he do that by just hiking
[1:44:42] amen only doing for example he loves to
[1:44:45] do mechanics mechanic thing can he do
[1:44:49] that by doing only mechanics no right
[1:44:51] you have to to plan and and and do what
[1:44:56] is related to that Vision amen
[1:45:00] so who said this I think it was Thomas
[1:45:03] said this on I guess he said genius is
[1:45:05] 1%
[1:45:07] inspiration and 90 99%
[1:45:11] perspiration what does that mean 1% oh I
[1:45:14] love I want to have 100%
[1:45:16] mathematics uh average but to do that
[1:45:20] you have to have the 99% yeah action
[1:45:23] it doesn't come
[1:45:25] overnight right you have to you have to
[1:45:28] study all those things right so there
[1:45:32] are there are it's called progression
[1:45:35] right it's called process that there's
[1:45:37] no instant thing in my case when we talk
[1:45:40] with my yeah forgive me miles and my
[1:45:43] family when we talk as a family of
[1:45:46] course they're open right so the thing
[1:45:48] is they want to have salary same as me
[1:45:51] for example miles
[1:45:53] he has one year two years experience I
[1:45:56] have 29 years experience he wanted it to
[1:45:59] have the same as me it didn't come
[1:46:02] overnight brothers and sisters right 29
[1:46:04] years of hard labor although I came from
[1:46:07] a very poor family I'm not saying I'm
[1:46:09] rich but uh God is good God is merciful
[1:46:12] and provide all our needs but then it
[1:46:15] took a lot of work for me but my vision
[1:46:18] I remembered it's just like when I was
[1:46:20] in high school before graduating so so
[1:46:23] my English uh teacher they ask everyone
[1:46:27] it's like a Futures blueprint or
[1:46:29] whatever on what you see your what do
[1:46:32] you see yourself how do you see yourself
[1:46:34] 5 10 years from now so you have to have
[1:46:37] a right you have to write a short story
[1:46:39] about it so of course five years oh I
[1:46:41] want to have this much I I I want to
[1:46:44] have a house blah blah blah get married
[1:46:47] all these things right the they are
[1:46:48] Visions right so the thing is although
[1:46:52] although you have those Visions
[1:46:54] sometimes big Visions they cannot be
[1:46:57] achieved right away so that's why to
[1:46:59] have you have to break it down into
[1:47:01] little pieces and that's why even even
[1:47:04] climbing a ladder it's better to climb
[1:47:07] little by little rather than big climb
[1:47:10] you wanted to reach the top there's a
[1:47:13] power in small steps amen and even
[1:47:16] coming up we cannot be on the top with
[1:47:19] even spiritually without feeding the
[1:47:21] word how can you be how can you be
[1:47:24] spiritually stable without feeding the
[1:47:25] word amen I'm guilty oh Lord help me but
[1:47:30] it's better to to understand our
[1:47:33] limitations it's like brother Bram is
[1:47:36] saying everyone has
[1:47:38] complex
[1:47:39] agree but the thing is a complex is
[1:47:44] already resolved once you acknowledge
[1:47:48] that there is a complex any problem has
[1:47:51] a solution amen otherwise it's not a
[1:47:54] problem it's a fact right so any problem
[1:47:57] must have a solution remember that and
[1:47:59] knowing that there is a problem it's
[1:48:00] already 50%
[1:48:02] solved and then you have to work the
[1:48:04] next 50% I'm just putting a hypothetical
[1:48:07] thing here but to be honest half of it
[1:48:09] is solved once you know that there is an
[1:48:10] issue if my wife will tell me oh how
[1:48:13] come you're like this like that
[1:48:15] oh I have to step back and no no no no
[1:48:18] you're the one who has an issue right
[1:48:21] would I react that way or I will just
[1:48:23] say okay you know a fish that is uh that
[1:48:28] has a mouth that is not that is shot
[1:48:30] will not be you know
[1:48:34] hooked sorry I don't know where that
[1:48:36] come from
[1:48:40] but remember that I mean maybe that that
[1:48:43] might be a good thing amen I think I
[1:48:46] think it might be good yeah because when
[1:48:49] we're always talking like that if a fish
[1:48:50] is always ah then the bite will you know
[1:48:54] you'll be hooked it's the same for us
[1:48:57] when we don't hear we're just wanted to
[1:48:59] hear what the other will say and then
[1:49:01] counteract why don't we put ourselves in
[1:49:04] silence one mouth two ears listen 50 uh
[1:49:09] 200% talk 100% but listen so we'll put
[1:49:13] it 100 because we will love to to speak
[1:49:15] right so but listen to 100% amen so
[1:49:21] so I don't know where is coming but then
[1:49:23] the thing
[1:49:24] is this is the summary the way I see it
[1:49:27] so it is based on Perfection and then
[1:49:31] the body of
[1:49:33] Christ is built on the word of God Amen
[1:49:38] that's why the word of God is the body
[1:49:40] of Christ and the head is him himself
[1:49:44] amen right the body means it's a
[1:49:47] progression on how so that he can go up
[1:49:50] to here without any mortal
[1:49:53] amen this bottom here must have the same
[1:49:56] size as the top here amen
[1:49:59] no uh no no leaks y it must be totally
[1:50:04] sealed amen a rocket that has a liak
[1:50:06] will not come up right that's right it
[1:50:09] will explode in midair if there is a
[1:50:12] leak so and a rocket needs to have
[1:50:16] pressure underneath so that it can come
[1:50:18] up so that's why we need pressures
[1:50:20] trials sufferings it's all for our good
[1:50:24] amen amen so here before the head can
[1:50:29] come down the word of God the body of
[1:50:33] Christ must be shaped exactly the same
[1:50:36] as his so that he can put and then now
[1:50:39] brother ready now it's full no mortar
[1:50:41] thank you brother God bless you no
[1:50:43] mortar no nothing and it's a whole thing
[1:50:48] this is the full Masterpiece of God just
[1:50:49] a summary it's the masterpiece pece
[1:50:53] family you me many member body and
[1:50:58] Christ am that's the second Masterpiece
[1:51:00] the first Masterpiece
[1:51:02] fell Adam and Eve right but then you see
[1:51:06] the typing
[1:51:07] there Adam was smitten oh let's go with
[1:51:11] the let's step back Moses sculpture was
[1:51:14] Mitten it made it a
[1:51:16] masterpiece Adam was Mee to get the
[1:51:19] bride but then they fell so he restored
[1:51:23] through through this process of the word
[1:51:25] through Patriarchs Patriarchs through
[1:51:27] the word of God and Jesus Christ so it's
[1:51:29] a love story whole thing so that we can
[1:51:32] be in we we can be Masterpiece family
[1:51:36] again am amen because uh because uh Adam
[1:51:39] and Eve fell amen and but but we can
[1:51:43] never fail amen because we are his we
[1:51:48] are in him we are one with him amen
[1:51:51] right amen
[1:51:53] all that is in God he poured it into
[1:51:55] Christ all that is in Christ he poured
[1:51:58] it
[1:51:59] into the bride which is the church
[1:52:01] Capital C Hallelujah he is one with us
[1:52:06] we are one with
[1:52:08] him amen so with
[1:52:11] that the preaching last Wednesday he is
[1:52:14] the door right the shepherd is the door
[1:52:17] Jesus Christ is the door in a mystical
[1:52:18] body no one can come to the ship to take
[1:52:22] them unless unless the door will allow
[1:52:25] it amen and he will a true Shepherd will
[1:52:29] not allow his his ship to to to to to be
[1:52:34] in destruction to be destroyed by anyone
[1:52:37] right he will lay his life that's why he
[1:52:40] sleeps on the door no other no no no
[1:52:44] other uh evil evil uh evil forces can
[1:52:49] come except through that door amen and
[1:52:52] for us brothers and
[1:52:53] sisters we cannot be deceived if we if
[1:52:56] we are in Christ amen but if we we go on
[1:53:01] our own uh on our own way away from the
[1:53:04] Lord away from the word of God then we
[1:53:05] will be it's it's a bit of a destruction
[1:53:08] amen we heard it also last last
[1:53:10] Wednesday he might break your leg so
[1:53:13] that you can you can be closer to him
[1:53:16] amen we don't want that no because we
[1:53:18] have a clear instruction by the prophet
[1:53:21] of this age
[1:53:23] it's it's so important brothers and
[1:53:25] sisters because this is a way of life
[1:53:27] right so that we how can we be a perfect
[1:53:30] Masterpiece if uh because uh it's
[1:53:34] impossible for us not to be perfect
[1:53:36] Masterpiece amen if we believe the word
[1:53:38] of the Lord amen because he's the one
[1:53:41] controlling you know what he wanted us
[1:53:43] to do is just to surrender amen
[1:53:46] hallelujah and not to be you know the
[1:53:50] three Giants br br can just preach that
[1:53:52] loss of the flesh loss of the eyes pride
[1:53:54] of life the most problem here in North
[1:53:57] America is about pride of life because
[1:54:00] we have we have a lot here even during
[1:54:04] covid right the government will give you
[1:54:07] although they will just print money and
[1:54:08] then later on you'll pay anyway but at
[1:54:10] least you can buy food right but you
[1:54:13] know pride of life is hard to to
[1:54:16] overcome amen right so so so the thing
[1:54:19] is uh
[1:54:22] I in in yeah just to be honest with you
[1:54:25] in my career when I when we see when we
[1:54:29] see that we're we finish a a project we
[1:54:33] started almost 3 years ago 2021 and now
[1:54:36] it's being commissioned and it cost I'll
[1:54:38] be honest 325 million so that that is
[1:54:41] for the sake of discussion it's a huge
[1:54:44] project many moving Parts many members
[1:54:48] but then I'm just one of the pebble of
[1:54:50] the on the beach being being part of
[1:54:52] that project but I have a a a a a piece
[1:54:57] to uh to carry out a role an assignment
[1:55:01] that I need to deliver so tomorrow I'll
[1:55:05] be flying there because the thing is
[1:55:06] they will produce now because they want
[1:55:08] us to be on standby in case of any issue
[1:55:11] but my point there is
[1:55:14] uh knowing that we finish that big
[1:55:17] project it looks like oh oh wow I I did
[1:55:21] it I did it no
[1:55:23] the way I see it it's a it's it's just
[1:55:26] the Lord that will give us to show us
[1:55:30] that uh we think that we are valuable
[1:55:32] because we we we we did our best it's
[1:55:35] successful for example we think that oh
[1:55:39] this is our 1.8 billion uh project for
[1:55:41] example in 11 years for example it looks
[1:55:45] like it will make you very very prideful
[1:55:49] pride of life is but the best thing
[1:55:52] what what God is asking us is to think
[1:55:54] that we're no one that's the only time
[1:55:57] he can uh he can he can tell us that uh
[1:56:00] he can prove that uh he's in control
[1:56:02] when we surrender because we we have
[1:56:05] this principle in
[1:56:07] uh especially me
[1:56:10] when when I uh uh train uh one of our or
[1:56:16] our Engineers or students my EIT just
[1:56:19] got his license bn's license and I was
[1:56:23] the one who coached him and vouch for
[1:56:25] him and it's a lot of work also for me
[1:56:27] but then the thing is when he joined my
[1:56:28] team and he became my engineer in
[1:56:31] training uh he knows everything right so
[1:56:36] all right okay so I I've been telling
[1:56:38] this but every time even with students
[1:56:41] because aristotel although it's he's not
[1:56:44] a Believer I guess he said that the more
[1:56:46] you know the more you realize you don't
[1:56:48] know right right and it's the same with
[1:56:51] the word the more we think that uh we
[1:56:53] know all and then come trials sufferings
[1:56:56] and then you don't know what to do and
[1:56:58] even now with the young people because
[1:57:00] they have J GPT they can resolve the
[1:57:02] whole world right so it's different it's
[1:57:06] it needs experience right but then the
[1:57:08] thing is also an instruction that we
[1:57:10] need to follow right God already valued
[1:57:15] us right how because his purpose
[1:57:19] is the purpose of God stands in a ction
[1:57:22] amen we know that it's in sardan church
[1:57:25] age right so what does that mean he
[1:57:28] created or he chose a bride of of his
[1:57:31] own choosing even before the foundation
[1:57:34] of the world I want to I want uh uh
[1:57:37] brother Peter here to to be my bride in
[1:57:41] type right because uh he's a man how
[1:57:43] come he can he could be a bride but with
[1:57:45] this day and age it doesn't matter now
[1:57:47] right because they have a lot of
[1:57:48] pronouns anyway so but uh you know so
[1:57:52] but but what I'm saying is in type right
[1:57:56] in his mind he already
[1:57:59] predestinated because of his for
[1:58:01] knowledge he already predestinated
[1:58:02] brother Peter here to be a bride of his
[1:58:05] own choosing so to be a bride of his own
[1:58:08] choosing there are
[1:58:10] steps right for that Vision to manifest
[1:58:13] there are steps and and that step is he
[1:58:15] needs to be baptized he needs to be
[1:58:17] attending church he needs to be
[1:58:19] perfected right so that he can get
[1:58:21] married with Jesus Jesus Christ meeting
[1:58:23] in the air and then uh come Millennium
[1:58:25] which is uh married supper and so on and
[1:58:27] so forth and live happily ever after
[1:58:31] amen so so my point is it's always a
[1:58:33] process but then the thing is anything
[1:58:36] that we value here sometimes okay oh
[1:58:39] okay I pay a lot of tights for example
[1:58:42] it it might think that uh we can be
[1:58:45] puffed up right but then the thing is
[1:58:47] it's just the Lord it means the reason
[1:58:49] why he blessed you because you're a good
[1:58:51] steward amen remember that the reason
[1:58:54] why he give you a lot of blessing
[1:58:56] financially because he knows that you
[1:58:58] will use it for the glory of God you
[1:59:01] will share it to brothers and sisters
[1:59:03] who who didn't have that uh capability
[1:59:06] right because think of this even even
[1:59:08] before uh after after the after the
[1:59:12] experience in the hoer room remember all
[1:59:14] the apostles and the Believers they put
[1:59:16] all their wealth together right
[1:59:20] right are we ready to do that because
[1:59:23] that will happen brothers and sisters
[1:59:25] because later on whatever your bank
[1:59:28] account uh is it doesn't matter right
[1:59:31] because this is only paper fiat currency
[1:59:34] remember it's not backed in gold right
[1:59:37] it can just disappear it's happening
[1:59:39] everywhere but uh it will come so let's
[1:59:42] let's be loose not to hold things
[1:59:45] tightly that we think that it's our oh
[1:59:47] oh because I work hard of course we work
[1:59:50] hard that's why we were given that way
[1:59:51] but then God has a purpose not every
[1:59:54] hard worker will receive the same thing
[1:59:56] amen but how come he gave you this
[1:59:58] because he knows that you are a good
[2:00:00] Steward of anything that he he owns
[2:00:03] everything belongs to God remember that
[2:00:06] amen we're just stewards here and when
[2:00:09] we go for Missions we see oh there's a
[2:00:10] need for church here oh building here oh
[2:00:14] yes of course we we have to help if we
[2:00:15] can right if we cannot send if we cannot
[2:00:18] go ourselves we have to send someone
[2:00:21] right missions is part of the ministry
[2:00:23] five cold Ministry remember Apostles is
[2:00:26] they're the one that establish churches
[2:00:28] Apostle that's Mission missionary
[2:00:30] brother Branham is saying so I'm not
[2:00:32] saying that uh I'm I'm not that what I'm
[2:00:35] saying here is there are some principles
[2:00:37] that we need to to do so that uh that
[2:00:40] Vision can manifest amen amen so I hope
[2:00:45] this one uh summarize a little bit what
[2:00:47] what the Masterpiece is it means at the
[2:00:49] end of at the head here with the
[2:00:52] prophets means including the bride this
[2:00:55] is a perfect Masterpiece one whole thing
[2:00:57] that's right right founded by the
[2:01:01] Patriarchs right formed by the word of
[2:01:04] God through the prophet amen right
[2:01:07] because we were asked to prophesy again
[2:01:09] we were not the seed is not only given
[2:01:12] to be a seed it needs to be cultivated
[2:01:15] it needs to be watered so that it will
[2:01:17] grow and bear fruits amen so that's
[2:01:19] that's what we need to do be being uh a
[2:01:22] Christian because it's a life amen and
[2:01:24] then come Jesus Christ as a whole thing
[2:01:26] so this is a whole thing so remove every
[2:01:30] step here it will not be a a perfect
[2:01:32] Masterpiece anymore it's not complete
[2:01:34] that's why we're so glad we have this
[2:01:37] message of the hour because it's tying
[2:01:39] the Loose
[2:01:41] Ends amen so I hope you got it a little
[2:01:45] bit uh but it's okay I guess we can talk
[2:01:48] more I think let's go to the next one
[2:01:51] these are a little bit of summaries
[2:01:54] here and then we will close maybe in few
[2:01:58] minutes here I think we're on time
[2:02:02] so to do things we have to break it down
[2:02:05] I I mentioned so that it's achievable
[2:02:08] right amen at but at first before doing
[2:02:10] anything you should have a vision first
[2:02:13] on what you want to achieve right and
[2:02:15] then act on it and then that will be the
[2:02:18] result right so so that it's easy
[2:02:21] because even young young person what
[2:02:24] does he want to do oh I want to learn
[2:02:25] bike Biking For example of course he he
[2:02:28] needs to study with the help of the mom
[2:02:30] and the dad or the brother right they
[2:02:32] will try to to to to study or to learn
[2:02:35] biking by training and everything and
[2:02:37] then that's a result it's achievable
[2:02:39] right so with
[2:02:41] Michelangelo I I mentioned a while ago
[2:02:44] I'm already ramping down here he has
[2:02:47] that uh mind or Vision to to sculpt
[2:02:53] Moses right so what did he do as a plan
[2:02:56] of action lots of hard work he looked
[2:02:59] for material right he did it day and
[2:03:02] night and uh oh oh this might be a
[2:03:05] little bit wrong I have to uh you
[2:03:08] know being humans we're not perfect
[2:03:11] right but then in the image of God we
[2:03:13] have a lot of uh imperfections but then
[2:03:15] the thing is he will beat us up like the
[2:03:18] gold so that the full reflection will be
[2:03:21] shown or can be he his image will be on
[2:03:24] the gold it means through trials and
[2:03:26] sufferings we will be made perfect amen
[2:03:30] and while he he's having this action
[2:03:32] lots of hard work then he formed Moses
[2:03:35] the sculpture of Moses but then the
[2:03:37] thing is the result it's a masterpiece
[2:03:40] but then the thing is with his vision
[2:03:43] maybe it just came that it's so true
[2:03:45] that he said oh I want him to be alive
[2:03:47] that's why he bit it speak then he
[2:03:50] didn't want to speak so he he bit it he
[2:03:52] SM smitten it Smite it uh with with a
[2:03:56] hammer or or a chisel right yeah so and
[2:04:02] God the great sculptor the first
[2:04:05] Masterpiece his vision is to do the
[2:04:07] first Masterpiece and that is First Man
[2:04:10] created in his own image reflecting
[2:04:13] Divine attributes amen because if you
[2:04:16] want to be in the image of God or he
[2:04:19] wanted to create a man that in his own
[2:04:20] image image means the same as what he
[2:04:23] can that's why Adam is a miniature God
[2:04:27] he has the power to speak right he named
[2:04:30] all the animals trees and whatever in
[2:04:33] front of him but then he did that and
[2:04:35] then once uh once Eve came out of him
[2:04:40] that's is SM thing also right so he
[2:04:44] created man on the sixth day Adam and
[2:04:46] then Eve and then he placed them in the
[2:04:48] garden Masterpiece family but then it
[2:04:51] didn't end in in uh in Garden of Eden
[2:04:55] because uh sin came a Twist of the story
[2:04:58] and then that's why we need to be
[2:04:59] restored right and then the SEC the
[2:05:01] second Masterpiece which is the Jesus
[2:05:04] Christ and the bride which is perfect
[2:05:06] Masterpiece family maybe I call the
[2:05:08] musicians so at least we can sing some
[2:05:10] songs here so the second second
[2:05:13] Masterpiece here is the second Adam
[2:05:16] which is the perfect one right that is
[2:05:19] his vision right to have a perfect
[2:05:22] Masterpiece family through the second
[2:05:26] Adam which is Jesus Christ and he was
[2:05:29] also
[2:05:31] smitten right on the cross yes so that
[2:05:35] the bride can come out of him right amen
[2:05:39] amen
[2:05:42] so because we are we fell we needed
[2:05:46] restoration amen amen and the
[2:05:48] restoration I we we summarize it it's
[2:05:50] through the word word of God perfect
[2:05:53] word of God through what through the
[2:05:54] prophets amen good foundation so that we
[2:05:57] can we can put Christ as our head it
[2:06:00] means we need to be totally surrendered
[2:06:02] amen so and then you can see it's the
[2:06:06] full Masterpiece family amen yes so now
[2:06:09] I can I can preach now I guess
[2:06:14] oh so you can see the
[2:06:18] Masterpiece cannot be perfect without
[2:06:21] each and every one of us
[2:06:23] amen it means we need to look for the
[2:06:27] last predestinated seed yes and if we
[2:06:30] cannot do that by our own work you have
[2:06:34] to help someone to do it because there
[2:06:36] are missionaries in the field that have
[2:06:38] that desire that's the reason why we
[2:06:40] have a church in lead bridge and
[2:06:42] everywhere we're trying to do that if
[2:06:44] you know and and that's a good motive
[2:06:48] and that's what God asks us to do is to
[2:06:50] look for the last
[2:06:54] amen everyone in this room as I've
[2:06:58] mentioned has a role amen right you
[2:07:01] cannot just say I'm just a member here
[2:07:05] I'm just a janitor here
[2:07:07] or everyone is required amen because in
[2:07:12] a million without a penny it's not a
[2:07:15] million
[2:07:17] anymore right amen little Pebble on the
[2:07:20] beach
[2:07:21] it compos the whole thing right but
[2:07:24] you're just a pebble on a wide variety
[2:07:27] of uh Beach but everyone's required so
[2:07:32] don't think too little of ourselves amen
[2:07:35] yes it's not because one is preaching
[2:07:37] here is a big eye there's no big eyes
[2:07:39] and little use brothers and sisters we
[2:07:41] are all required to make a body and if
[2:07:45] one body or one part of the body is
[2:07:47] hurting the whole body is hurting
[2:07:50] including the head I'm talking about
[2:07:51] body means includes the body and all the
[2:07:54] parts of the uh the head and all parts
[2:07:56] of the body amen
[2:07:58] so learn or I mean uh understand that we
[2:08:01] are we belong to a mystical body and we
[2:08:04] have a role to play
[2:08:10] amen we are God's Masterpiece brothers
[2:08:13] and sisters we are Christ Masterpiece of
[2:08:16] even amen he IM imagine how valuable you
[2:08:21] are
[2:08:22] he gave his life what else can he give
[2:08:23] better than life imagine if they give
[2:08:26] you a billion but you will die tomorrow
[2:08:27] you will you accept the one billion no
[2:08:31] no one will will because life is
[2:08:33] precious and that's what God gave to us
[2:08:37] his life his he said only begotten son
[2:08:40] but that's him right we know about it
[2:08:43] that uh he came he needs to have a flesh
[2:08:47] so that he can die because God is a
[2:08:49] spirit that's the reason why he came
[2:08:50] down with this his body of Flesh in the
[2:08:53] beginning was the word and the Word was
[2:08:54] with God and the Word was God and he
[2:08:57] became flesh and dwelt Among Us so
[2:08:59] there's a reason why he came to flesh
[2:09:01] because he cannot die as God because
[2:09:03] he's a spirit so he need that body and
[2:09:05] where's that body now he's in you and me
[2:09:08] yes sir amen we have that presentation
[2:09:10] before if if if this is a lot of uh
[2:09:12] water here and then if you drink it
[2:09:14] where is God now it's in you right amen
[2:09:17] oh I have bloods here but uh so you see
[2:09:20] it's a Redemption story
[2:09:21] amen right he knows that uh you can we
[2:09:24] cannot save ourselves it's impossible
[2:09:27] we're just playing the drama here the
[2:09:29] role that he gave to us in a play right
[2:09:31] everyone as a as a even those in the
[2:09:34] background even here without the without
[2:09:37] the musicians without the song leader
[2:09:39] without the the the song the sound
[2:09:42] technician most importantly without the
[2:09:45] congregation that's pulling so that
[2:09:47] there will be preaching it's not a
[2:09:48] complete service we cannot preach on our
[2:09:51] our own but we want to bless God right
[2:09:54] amen and about worship we always Worship
[2:09:58] the Lord we want to Worship the Lord and
[2:09:59] giving is one of them right it's not
[2:10:02] only in music in everything give worship
[2:10:06] I we've been talking me and my wife
[2:10:08] what's the difference between prayer and
[2:10:10] worship prayer is asking God for all the
[2:10:13] petitions right but worship is about him
[2:10:17] him alone is not about us when we when
[2:10:20] we set aside
[2:10:22] ourselves that's real worship amen when
[2:10:26] we set aside ourselves and give all the
[2:10:28] Adoration praise and thank uh
[2:10:30] Thanksgiving to him because of what he
[2:10:32] did in Calvary that's
[2:10:34] worship when so many nuggets Brothers
[2:10:38] but then yeah it's a I just told my wife
[2:10:41] I will not put a lot of uh uh you know
[2:10:45] uh slides and I'll just take but uh upon
[2:10:49] writing I have already three pages and I
[2:10:51] am just in the first page but we we have
[2:10:55] to I hope you got the the point though I
[2:10:57] mean uh we're special people it's
[2:11:00] always we believe a positive message
[2:11:03] amen this message is not a dos and
[2:11:06] don'ts it's Grace right it's uh it's
[2:11:10] encompassing it's bringing everyone
[2:11:12] inside it's imparting life right
[2:11:15] imparting life to those who don't
[2:11:16] believe it right it's important and when
[2:11:21] we think that uh we we we we are
[2:11:24] acquainted with the world because we are
[2:11:25] still in this world we have colleagues
[2:11:28] we have you know families that don't
[2:11:30] believe this message but are we going to
[2:11:31] just Shan them no we we need them right
[2:11:35] we we want them to be inside inside the
[2:11:37] fold amen it's so important brothers
[2:11:40] that's why how can you how can you
[2:11:42] impart eternal life when you don't have
[2:11:44] it right you must have it first before
[2:11:46] you can impart it how can you share the
[2:11:49] word of God if you don't have the word
[2:11:51] of God God in you oh brothers that's why
[2:11:54] we need to feed the word I'm guilty oh
[2:11:56] help me help me
[2:11:59] Lord I think we are all amen we cannot
[2:12:02] just say we're oh I'm already good I'm
[2:12:05] good for Rapture but remember if you
[2:12:07] believe the word for your day you're
[2:12:09] already in the Rapture you're just being
[2:12:11] perfected you're being processed how can
[2:12:14] you be processed by trials suffering so
[2:12:16] that you can have
[2:12:17] Perfection you you see how Joseph became
[2:12:20] perfect it's true trials and sufferings
[2:12:22] every everywhere he went is almost oh
[2:12:24] wow he was sold for 30 pieces of silver
[2:12:26] he was in the prison he was accused so
[2:12:29] many things but then what what happened
[2:12:31] he was restored as a right hand of
[2:12:33] pharaoh right so that he can give way
[2:12:36] for the Messiah to give life to impart
[2:12:39] life to whom to Judah because the
[2:12:41] because Christ came from the tribe of
[2:12:43] Judah not not from the tribe of
[2:12:46] Joseph right Joseph was given that uh
[2:12:50] that that that uh assignment you will be
[2:12:54] given this imagine don't think that
[2:12:56] Joseph is the main there no it's about
[2:12:58] Judah preserving life am of Judah so
[2:13:01] that the seed which is Jesus Christ can
[2:13:04] go through
[2:13:05] Judah oh there is always a purpose
[2:13:08] brothers and sisters and everything that
[2:13:10] we do there's always a purpose and it's
[2:13:12] for our good Romans 8:28 and it's a
[2:13:16] transformation of life we need to be
[2:13:18] transformed to His Image because his
[2:13:20] vision is to be the same In His
[2:13:24] Image right his his vision is uh to to
[2:13:27] create a man in his own image and
[2:13:30] likeness so that we can be like God like
[2:13:33] him amen so don't go outside the fold
[2:13:37] amen which is Jesus Christ himself amen
[2:13:41] that's our only hope there's no other
[2:13:44] hope right oh again the word is the
[2:13:48] absolute but the absolute is in the
[2:13:49] message it's a binocular so that we can
[2:13:52] see we can understand and when it's it's
[2:13:55] very far we have to put things into
[2:13:58] proper perspect hallelujah oh brothers
[2:14:01] and
[2:14:02] sisters feel good I hope uh I hope the
[2:14:06] Lord is blessed we want to bless him

[2:14:10] be blessed we want to bless him we want
[2:14:12] to adore him we want to worship him give
[2:14:14] everything to him amen oh amen
[2:14:21] you know without God we are nothing
[2:14:24] right
[2:14:26] remember the mountain is Holy because
[2:14:29] God is in that
[2:14:31] mountain this room is just a normal room
[2:14:34] if God is not in it amen hallelujah
[2:14:38] there there's a a bit of a story just uh
[2:14:40] just to break it I think we have a
[2:14:42] little bit of
[2:14:43] time uh it's not a true story just to to
[2:14:47] put a context in it there are two
[2:14:48] donkeys walking and one donkey was
[2:14:51] saying I can't understand it said to the
[2:14:54] other donkey he said
[2:14:58] yesterday Jesus Christ is on top of me
[2:15:01] and everyone is just putting all the
[2:15:03] good things so that I can uh walk on
[2:15:05] that uh
[2:15:07] thing right a donkey because Jesus
[2:15:09] Christ is walking to at the Palm Sunday
[2:15:12] there what what they call it uh right uh
[2:15:15] they're putting all uh all all leaves
[2:15:18] and whatnot so it's it's a gr entrance
[2:15:21] because the Messiah is coming is is is
[2:15:24] on that donkey so the donkey was saying
[2:15:27] wow I'm special because uh you know
[2:15:30] they're putting everything on my path so
[2:15:32] that I can walk on it then but now after
[2:15:36] Jesus is not here they just don't know
[2:15:41] me and then the other donkey was saying
[2:15:44] that's life bro he said without Jesus
[2:15:47] you're nothing
[2:15:51] same for you and me if we take that
[2:15:53] principle brothers and sisters without
[2:15:55] Christ we are
[2:15:57] nothing right it's so important to
[2:16:00] understand that that uh we are nothing
[2:16:02] no matter how knowledgeable we are we
[2:16:05] can go cover to cover on the Bible

[2:22:44] the full duty of man is to to fear the
[2:22:47] lord and obey his Commandments oh Lord
[2:22:49] but how we obey something that we don't
[2:22:53] know that's why the word came through a
[2:22:55] prophet so that we know what to
[2:22:58] obey Lord we doesn't mean that we know
[2:23:01] how to read Lord that you that we will
[2:23:04] understand it's your Revelation oh Lord
[2:23:07] Jesus Oh Lord It's just by your grace
[2:23:09] and mercy you have put that Faith which
[2:23:11] is a revelation unto us Lord your
[2:23:15] faith faith of Jesus Christ that is
[2:23:19] living in US that is infilled in us
[2:23:22] that's the reason why we are able to to
[2:23:25] to move ahead oh Lord Jesus Oh Lord
[2:23:27] without you we are
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:30] nothing but when we understand the

[2:23:42] Redemption story oh
[2:23:44] Lord when the bride and Christ are one
[2:23:48] oh Lord we might have different levels
[2:23:51] of Faith here this morning oh Lord with
[2:23:54] lots of younger
[2:23:58] ones lot of older ones we might have a
[2:24:02] lot of uh Lord doubt sometimes but then
[2:24:06] for those who already walk this Faith
[2:24:08] Lord we know we can give guidance to
[2:24:11] those who are still stepping into that
[2:24:14] uh age Lord let's say in in in getting
[2:24:18] married it's a it's a desire oh Lord
[2:24:21] Jesus because that's a even yourself
[2:24:24] didn't want to be alone that's why you
[2:24:26] created
[2:24:28] us same for us oh Lord but we want to
[2:24:31] have a vision oh Lord Jesus that will
[2:24:33] not be contrary to your word oh Lord
[2:24:36] Jesus we want to always be checking
[2:24:39] theim is it according to the word is it

[2:25:09] and and we're so thankful Lord that the
[2:25:12] that the message of the hour is preached
[2:25:14] on this Pulpit with balance not with uh
[2:25:18] with with dos and don'ts or do that are
[2:25:21] not according to your word Lord because
[2:25:23] we believe the prophet already mentioned

[2:29:27] the
[2:29:28] Hallelujah could you hear from your
[2:29:30] theophany
[2:29:32] today certainly thankful for the
[2:29:35] dedication of brother mvin and his
[2:29:37] desire to serve the
[2:29:38] Lord and the word that we heard this
[2:29:41] morning we know that was from the Lord I
[2:29:43] I just can't help but think it's such a
[2:29:45] beautiful thing I'm fully inspired to
[2:29:48] get right back into talking about
[2:29:50] families again but to think about the
[2:29:51] Masterpiece family that thought is
[2:29:54] something else and you know many times
[2:29:58] we think of the Masterpiece as as being
[2:30:00] absolutely perfect and it is absolutely
[2:30:04] perfect but what makes the Perfection is
[2:30:07] the
[2:30:08] imperfection amen it's the imperfection
[2:30:11] that makes the Perfection and isn't it a
[2:30:13] beautiful thing to think about Adam who
[2:30:15] had all of the right in the entire world
[2:30:18] we heard about it this morning we could
[2:30:20] have simply said forget about her I got
[2:30:23] a bunch more ribs let's make another
[2:30:26] rib let's make another rde do we have
[2:30:30] something wrong is that headset still
[2:30:34] on he could have easily chosen another
[2:30:37] bride but he didn't what he did was he
[2:30:38] stepped out of his first estate to
[2:30:40] rescue his bride what a tremendous thing
[2:30:43] it is to think and we have the
[2:30:45] opportunity as husbands As Leaders of
[2:30:47] our home gods of our families to
[2:30:51] restore and we know that's what the word
[2:30:53] says that I will restore saith the Lord
[2:30:56] Redemption doesn't come from the bride
[2:30:58] Redemption comes from the husband and we
[2:31:00] have the ability to impart that with our
[2:31:03] families I think it's a beautiful
[2:31:05] thought the the the Perfection is
[2:31:07] actually in the imperfection or the
[2:31:09] weakness or seemingly even the
[2:31:12] error my goodness didn't Eve make an
[2:31:15] error but her husband was willing to
[2:31:18] step out completely
[2:31:20] and look past her error and take her
[2:31:23] back into him what a tremendous thought
[2:31:27] vision and purpose we need to have the
[2:31:30] vision and purpose that vision and
[2:31:32] purpose will give us the ability to
[2:31:34] cause and action and that action will
[2:31:36] create a result and I just couldn't help
[2:31:38] but think while brother mvin was
[2:31:39] bringing this while the Lord was
[2:31:40] ministering to us whether we actually
[2:31:43] intentionally do a vision and purpose
[2:31:45] and we actually intentionally do an
[2:31:47] action looking for a result we're still
[2:31:50] doing that whether we're planning to do
[2:31:53] it or we're actually just living Our
[2:31:55] Lives because not planning failing to
[2:31:58] plan is what planning to
[2:32:02] fail and the way we're talking about
[2:32:04] planning brothers and sisters isn't
[2:32:05] according to the Natural Realms in this
[2:32:08] world it's according to the word and the
[2:32:09] word we heard for our day it's got to be
[2:32:12] according to the message of the hour
[2:32:14] it's got to be the full Redemption for
[2:32:16] each and every one of us and when we can
[2:32:18] see that it gives us Grace it gives us
[2:32:21] Grace for everyone for our brothers and
[2:32:22] our sisters we no longer look at our
[2:32:23] brother and sister and see a fault or a
[2:32:25] failure or an error or a mistake what we
[2:32:28] see is the Perfection what we see is the
[2:32:30] Masterpiece of God working out through
[2:32:32] their lives it becomes a beautiful thing
[2:32:35] we don't look at this world the same
[2:32:37] anymore we know that brother bandam said
[2:32:38] when he got the Holy Ghost this book
[2:32:40] became a brand new book to him and it's
[2:32:43] the same for every one of us I could I
[2:32:46] could preach I feel like I could preach
[2:32:47] I got some notes here I'm certainly
[2:32:49] thankful for for the word this morning
[2:32:51] you know there's no other Foundation
[2:32:52] that we want to base our Salvation on
[2:32:55] except for that which was already
[2:32:57] preached what Paul already said and we
[2:32:59] know he said that if an angel or anyone
[2:33:02] comes and preaches something else than
[2:33:03] what was already said just let that
[2:33:05] person be a cursed and uh we certainly
[2:33:08] are thankful for what Paul already
[2:33:10] preached we just want to remind everyone
[2:33:12] that there was the grocery pickup this
[2:33:14] week There's groceries downstairs if you
[2:33:16] would like some by all means help
[2:33:18] yourself we don't want to have any
[2:33:20] leftovers we don't want any church mice
[2:33:22] eating our food so help yourself to what
[2:33:25] you see and and uh God richly bless you
[2:33:29] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[2:33:31] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:33:33] word that we heard today Lord we thank
[2:33:35] you that you gave us a solid foundation
[2:33:37] a foundation that's sure and Lord Jesus
[2:33:40] we thank you that father we can have the
[2:33:43] desire in our heart and if we have that
[2:33:45] desire in our heart it's because you
[2:33:47] placed it there before the foundation of
[2:33:49] the world it's not because of works of
[2:33:51] righteousness it's not because of tenure
[2:33:53] it's not because of what someone has
[2:33:55] done for us oh Lord Jesus it's only what
[2:33:58] you have done and we thank you for it
[2:34:00] Lord help us to take the words that were
[2:34:02] spoken today and and consider them
[2:34:05] Father in a spiritual realm Lord Jesus
[2:34:08] that we would be able to produce fruit
[2:34:11] that's worthy for you Lord we love you
[2:34:14] and we thank you we just want to commit
[2:34:15] each life now into your hands For Your
[2:34:17] Glory as we go our separate ways we pray
[2:34:20] that you would be with those who are
[2:34:21] traveling for your gospel today Lord
[2:34:24] bless brother mvin restore his strength
[2:34:26] we ask and if it Be Your Will for us to
[2:34:28] meet again on Wednesday Lord we'll be
[2:34:30] careful to come and give you all the
[2:34:32] praise we love you and we thank you we
[2:34:35] just ask all these things now in Jesus
[2:34:38] Christ's name we pray am
[2:34:41] amen can we sing that song We Are
[2:34:44] redeemed in him is that the is that the
[2:34:46] song it's not by works of righteousness
[2:34:50] but by his grace
[2:34:54] alone it's not by works of
[2:34:57] righteousness his
