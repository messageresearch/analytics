[54:11] how that not many wise men after the
[54:13] flesh
[54:15] not many mighty not many noble are
[54:18] called
[54:20] but God hath chosen the foolish things
[54:22] of the world to confound the wise
[54:26] and God hath chosen the weak things of
[54:28] the world to confound the things
[54:31] which are mighty
[54:34] and the base things of the world and the
[54:36] things which are despised hath God
[54:40] chosen
[54:41] yea and things which are not
[54:44] to bring to not things that are
[54:48] that no flesh should glory in his
[54:51] presence
[54:53] but of him
[54:55] are ye in Christ Jesus
[54:57] who
[54:59] of God is made unto us wisdom and
[55:02] righteousness and sanctification and
[55:05] Redemption
[55:07] that according as it is written
[55:10] he that glorieth let him glory in the
[55:13] Lord
[55:15] let's just bow one more time
[55:17] gracious Lord Jesus we pray that tonight
[55:20] father that we could just glory in you
[55:22] and Lord that it wouldn't just be for
[55:24] tonight that it would be for all time
[55:27] Lord if there's any anything good
[55:31] Lord Jesus in our lives let it be you
[55:34] that we talk about father Lord to think
[55:37] about how you've brought us
[55:39] through this world father to the place
[55:41] that we are positionally in tonight
[55:44] there's no way that we could ever have
[55:46] done it not one of us on our own
[55:49] if it were not your will
[55:51] so father tonight we just thank you and
[55:53] we pray that we could just bring Glory
[55:55] unto you
[55:57] that we would glory in you
[56:00] we just love you we thank you we ask
[56:01] that you would bless the reading of your
[56:03] word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[56:05] amen
[56:06] God bless you tonight you may be seated
[56:10] certainly good to be back
[56:12] after our trip and to be catching up
[56:15] we've had uh
[56:17] a lot going on recently and we're
[56:20] certainly thankful
[56:22] the Lord has given us the ability to do
[56:26] what we've done what we're doing and go
[56:28] through the stuff that we are going
[56:29] through
[56:31] um but yes it's certainly good to be
[56:33] back and and getting
[56:35] sort of on top of things
[56:38] um
[56:40] if nothing changes in the next 24 hours
[56:42] or less it looks like we will be able to
[56:45] have
[56:46] 27 people here in church on Sunday
[56:50] we're certainly looking forward to that
[56:53] really looking forward to that I trust
[56:56] that the Lord will continue to allow
[56:58] things to change for us so that we can
[57:00] do that
[57:01] and Lord willing the end of the month or
[57:03] you know sometime next month we could be
[57:06] at full capacity here which is just
[57:09] enormous
[57:10] we were talking about it earlier and I
[57:12] wasn't sure what the capacity is for
[57:14] outdoor Gatherings but it was mentioned
[57:16] that it could be 150 people
[57:20] with this uh new restriction tomorrow
[57:23] so I would say this if if that's the
[57:26] case then I would say plan on some
[57:29] kind of spur of the moment picnics
[57:33] we're going to have some fellowship
[57:34] brothers and sisters for those people
[57:36] who want to those people who can
[57:38] not everyone can just drop everything
[57:40] and and come but
[57:42] you know uh we had a little taste of it
[57:45] in the parking lot here on Sunday and it
[57:47] sure was nice to see some familiar faces
[57:49] just to be outside and and and to be
[57:52] together to Fellowship so it looks like
[57:55] the restrictions are lifting and what a
[57:56] tremendous thing it is it's going to be
[57:58] glorious
[58:00] um we have a spring cleanup lined up for
[58:02] the church
[58:04] um
[58:05] I believe it's June 12th is that right
[58:07] June the 12th we'd like to do it from 10
[58:10] in the morning until three in the
[58:11] afternoon we know that many hands makes
[58:14] light work so if you feel inclined if
[58:17] you feel inspired to bring a pair of
[58:20] hands to the church and come and we'll
[58:23] do a little cleanup and it in years past
[58:25] not last year but years past it's always
[58:29] been a nice time of Fellowship
[58:30] afterwards as well
[58:32] you know everybody
[58:34] brings uh
[58:36] brings a little bit of Fellowship to the
[58:38] table and a little bit of food yeah
[58:41] um
[58:43] we certainly
[58:45] excited about it
[58:47] so we're looking to full capacity in
[58:49] July and I don't understand what that
[58:51] will even be like but we'll trust the
[58:52] Lord will actually bless us
[58:57] um
[58:57] tonight I have a direction that uh
[59:00] I just feel
[59:03] impressed to go in and uh
[59:06] we'll just see if the Lord won't bless
[59:08] it it's kind of like almost two things
[59:10] at once but
[59:12] you know um
[59:14] just reading in the in the seals book
[59:17] getting into a little bit of the seals
[59:19] how brother Branham talks about what the
[59:22] word is and how the word represents
[59:24] itself to us as Believers and not just
[59:27] to us but through us
[59:30] brother Bradham says in the fourth seal
[59:32] that the word itself is a spirit
[59:35] it is a spirit in word form
[59:38] and then you see it is quickened or
[59:41] brought to life the spirit of the word
[59:44] goes to work and acts
[59:47] you know we talked about it on Sunday
[59:49] that it's a revelation to the True
[59:52] Believer
[59:53] we wind up getting things revealed to us
[59:56] and uh many times people
[59:59] they have a
[1:00:00] a theology
[1:00:02] and we talked about that
[1:00:04] theology if you look it up actually in
[1:00:06] Merriam-Webster a current dictionary
[1:00:08] it's one's belief in God and and that's
[1:00:11] all it's pretty simple and
[1:00:13] straightforward it's not even the
[1:00:14] instruction or teaching from a school
[1:00:16] it's just one's belief in God but if you
[1:00:19] look at old Noah Webster's Dictionary he
[1:00:23] talks about it in there and says that
[1:00:24] there's two two directions of the word
[1:00:28] Theology and one is natural carnal and
[1:00:31] the other one is revelation
[1:00:34] and we know that the word itself that we
[1:00:37] talk about tonight is truly a revelation
[1:00:39] because anybody can say the word word
[1:00:42] anybody can talk about the Bible anybody
[1:00:44] can say Jesus we know that millions and
[1:00:46] billions of people both have Jesus and
[1:00:50] the word and they're baptized in titles
[1:00:53] and what that does is it stops the power
[1:00:55] of God from being completely Unleashed
[1:00:58] in their lives
[1:00:59] but also we know
[1:01:01] that Spirits travel
[1:01:04] on words
[1:01:06] that's how Spirits travel
[1:01:08] so that's why it's so important to make
[1:01:10] sure that we are careful what we listen
[1:01:11] to
[1:01:12] we need to be careful what we watch
[1:01:15] and you know it's just becoming more and
[1:01:17] more clear to me in in my life it's
[1:01:20] important who
[1:01:22] we listen to
[1:01:24] as well as what we listen to
[1:01:26] we can take many different people's
[1:01:30] words and
[1:01:32] if we're not careful there can be words
[1:01:34] coming into our lives carrying spirits
[1:01:37] that like to try and get in the way of
[1:01:39] what we're doing try and get in the way
[1:01:41] of God's program we know that if we're
[1:01:43] sealed into the kingdom of God if we
[1:01:46] have been baptized in the name of the
[1:01:47] Lord Jesus Christ and we've met the
[1:01:49] requirements that we have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:52] In Our Lives Satan's going to come
[1:01:54] against us with all of his might he's
[1:01:56] going to try
[1:01:58] and try and try he's never going to give
[1:02:00] up he's created to be that way
[1:02:04] but what we're talking about tonight is
[1:02:06] the word itself is Spirit
[1:02:09] and and it itself is in word form but
[1:02:13] when those words are spoken off of the
[1:02:16] lips and the voice of a True Believer
[1:02:19] it's no longer just a True Believer
[1:02:22] speaking
[1:02:23] and there's a quote for it I'm not going
[1:02:25] to get into that tonight I just wanted
[1:02:28] to try and set a little bit of a
[1:02:29] background about the importance of the
[1:02:31] word and how God he never chose the
[1:02:34] great programs in this world
[1:02:38] we just read it tonight that God hath
[1:02:40] chosen the foolish things of this world
[1:02:42] to confound the wise
[1:02:44] he goes exactly against what it is we
[1:02:46] think should happen carnally speaking
[1:02:50] our theology is is a waste of time but
[1:02:54] when we talk about revelation
[1:02:56] now we're getting somewhere especially
[1:02:58] according to the message of the hour
[1:03:00] because we understand that that word
[1:03:02] itself is actually spirit and when that
[1:03:05] word is on the lips of a True Believer
[1:03:07] who has been baptized in the name of the
[1:03:09] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:03:11] their sins so that they could receive
[1:03:12] the gift of the Holy Spirit the true
[1:03:15] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:18] it burns out all of the dross in their
[1:03:20] life
[1:03:21] and when that word comes forward on the
[1:03:23] lips of a son and daughter of God it's
[1:03:26] no longer the son or daughter speaking
[1:03:29] is it it becomes full adoption and you
[1:03:32] know brothers and sisters even though we
[1:03:34] can't see it when we come to that place
[1:03:36] in our lives where we have everything in
[1:03:39] line and we know that the word itself is
[1:03:41] a spirit and that word is in spirit form
[1:03:44] and that word is on our lips and we're
[1:03:46] speaking it all hell trembles
[1:03:49] when you speak the word that way
[1:03:52] all hell
[1:03:53] is afraid of it you know the Devils they
[1:03:56] recognize Jesus
[1:03:58] but the most religious people couldn't
[1:04:00] same thing today brothers and sisters
[1:04:02] most religious people will look at us
[1:04:04] and say frenetics weirdos
[1:04:07] cults they'll have all kinds of
[1:04:10] different names for us
[1:04:11] but watch when you get around someone
[1:04:13] who has a vicious disease or someone
[1:04:16] that has a devil you ever seen someone
[1:04:18] that's all all crazy in the head as it
[1:04:22] were on the side of the road and walk up
[1:04:24] beside them you don't even have to say
[1:04:26] anything we've all I'm sure had
[1:04:27] experiences that way the Devils can't
[1:04:30] stand it
[1:04:31] when a True Believer gets close to them
[1:04:35] because they know they know who's
[1:04:36] standing by them
[1:04:39] you know I just have a couple of quotes
[1:04:41] as we get into our thought tonight
[1:04:43] um
[1:04:45] how brother Branham
[1:04:47] he says that the word
[1:04:49] is a spirit
[1:04:51] the spirit is in word form and that's
[1:04:53] what the Bible is
[1:04:55] and and talking about how God he likes
[1:04:57] to hide himself in Simplicity and reveal
[1:05:01] himself in the same
[1:05:03] he hasn't chosen the great things of
[1:05:05] this world to reveal himself in he
[1:05:07] didn't come to the the four seasons of
[1:05:11] Bethlehem
[1:05:12] did he
[1:05:14] even though there was no room but he
[1:05:16] didn't come in a great godly way
[1:05:19] he came to a stinking stable where there
[1:05:22] was animals how many of us would ever
[1:05:24] want to go to a stable to have our first
[1:05:27] child
[1:05:29] it just wouldn't happen
[1:05:31] we would go and and and go in someone's
[1:05:33] house before we would do that but he
[1:05:35] chose it was no accident there was no
[1:05:38] room at the end it was no accident that
[1:05:39] everything happened the way it did that
[1:05:41] they wrapped him in swaddling cloths the
[1:05:42] nastiest stinkiest probably hardest
[1:05:45] cloth that there was around they wrapped
[1:05:48] Jesus in as a fresh newborn baby there's
[1:05:52] no accident that they use that that that
[1:05:54] that cloth that went between the Yoke of
[1:05:57] the ox that absorbed all the bugs and
[1:05:59] the sweat and and all the grime this
[1:06:02] freshly born baby the Lamb of God was
[1:06:04] wrapped in that cloth
[1:06:07] it's no accident
[1:06:08] everything happens for a reason brothers
[1:06:10] and sisters
[1:06:12] but just talking out of the fifth seal
[1:06:14] here
[1:06:16] just going to read a couple things
[1:06:17] brother Branham says now
[1:06:20] now let me just let me just review that
[1:06:22] for a minute what makes God great is
[1:06:24] because he can make himself so simple
[1:06:27] that's what makes him great God is so
[1:06:29] great he can make himself in such a
[1:06:32] simple form that the wise of this world
[1:06:35] can't find him
[1:06:37] they just can't find him because he
[1:06:39] makes himself too simple
[1:06:43] now watch and this
[1:06:46] in itself
[1:06:48] is the mystery of the revelation of
[1:06:51] Jesus Christ see
[1:06:53] this in itself
[1:06:55] there's nothing
[1:06:57] greater than God and you can't make
[1:06:59] anything as simple
[1:07:01] As He makes himself
[1:07:03] see that's what makes him great see
[1:07:08] he goes on he goes on to say but the Way
[1:07:11] Up Is Down In God yes
[1:07:17] I like how brother Bradham tells this
[1:07:18] story here he tells just a little bit of
[1:07:21] a story here I've I've went into people
[1:07:23] in their offices and so forth that were
[1:07:25] really were were men big Kings see and
[1:07:29] potentates and monarchs and usually them
[1:07:31] are big men then I've went into places
[1:07:33] where a guy got a change of clothes
[1:07:36] maybe some Minister that wanted to argue
[1:07:39] with me a while
[1:07:41] and you would think that the world world
[1:07:43] couldn't run without him see
[1:07:45] that's a pretty important man
[1:07:48] and you would think that the world
[1:07:49] couldn't run without him see
[1:07:51] and that's just puffed up in the head
[1:07:53] see
[1:07:54] but a big man
[1:07:56] a big man sits down
[1:07:59] and tries to make you think
[1:08:01] you're the big man see
[1:08:04] he can humble himself
[1:08:08] imagine that
[1:08:10] I was having a conversation on the way
[1:08:12] to church with someone about how some
[1:08:13] people are like that and you know it
[1:08:15] doesn't matter
[1:08:16] whatever the conversation is that's
[1:08:18] happening in the moment
[1:08:20] they have to grab the conversation and
[1:08:22] take the conversation and make the
[1:08:23] conversation all about them
[1:08:26] did you ever talk to someone that's like
[1:08:28] that it just doesn't matter every time
[1:08:30] you get around that person they just
[1:08:32] have to grab it and make it them
[1:08:34] it's all about them
[1:08:36] it's funny how it works
[1:08:38] but you know what brother Bradham says
[1:08:40] the prophet says but a big man see
[1:08:43] he can humble himself he sits down and
[1:08:46] tries to make you think that you're the
[1:08:47] big man
[1:08:49] it goes on to say and you see God is so
[1:08:52] great
[1:08:53] till he can humble himself
[1:08:56] a place that a human being can't climb
[1:09:00] down that far you see
[1:09:02] that's all
[1:09:05] as long as you're going towards wisdom
[1:09:08] you're going away from him
[1:09:11] it's amazing when you look at what what
[1:09:12] he says and and how he says it
[1:09:15] and you know I'm not going to go on and
[1:09:17] and read all of it because there's so
[1:09:19] much here
[1:09:21] but
[1:09:23] just thinking about how how he hides
[1:09:26] himself in Simplicity and reveals
[1:09:28] himself in the same and and each one of
[1:09:30] us
[1:09:31] are are subject to that very thing I
[1:09:34] mean there's some great people in in and
[1:09:37] amongst our group and uh I certainly
[1:09:39] know that and I'm thankful to be a part
[1:09:42] of it it's wonderful to be a part of the
[1:09:45] body of God of Christ here on Earth
[1:09:49] but you know
[1:09:50] he's chosen the weak things of the world
[1:09:53] to confound the things which are mighty
[1:09:57] when we think about our lives
[1:10:00] how do we ever get to where we're at
[1:10:02] and I don't know about you but I've got
[1:10:04] people in my life and my family they
[1:10:06] would probably look at me and think how
[1:10:07] did he ever wind up where he is today
[1:10:12] and you know all I can say is is Grace
[1:10:15] Grace God's grace that's all it is it's
[1:10:19] it's that Grace that keeps me from day
[1:10:23] to day there's no way that I could ever
[1:10:24] be where I'm at were it not for God and
[1:10:27] and when we actually get to that place
[1:10:29] where we have that true Revelation our
[1:10:32] own theology in a revelation way it it
[1:10:35] it it it turns into something almost
[1:10:37] like a connect connect the dot picture
[1:10:39] in our lives we can go back and start to
[1:10:41] connect the dots and we begin to see a
[1:10:43] picture and and it's amazing because we
[1:10:46] know there's no way that we could have
[1:10:47] gone through the situations that we have
[1:10:48] to get to where we are and still
[1:10:52] love the Lord
[1:10:54] you know we talked about it a long time
[1:10:56] ago the difference between a Believer
[1:10:58] and an unbeliever is is when God puts us
[1:11:01] through a trial when he we ask him
[1:11:04] to answer a prayer and he doesn't answer
[1:11:07] it the way that we want it answered
[1:11:10] the True Believer says you know thank
[1:11:13] you Lord because I know that that answer
[1:11:15] is for my good even though it's not what
[1:11:18] I want I know it's for my good and I
[1:11:21] thank you Lord and and we go on and we
[1:11:23] worship in spirit and Truth we don't get
[1:11:26] upset
[1:11:27] we don't get frustrated and say he
[1:11:29] doesn't love me
[1:11:31] we know that whether we have flowery
[1:11:33] skies and bed of ease is no approval of
[1:11:37] the Father's Love right
[1:11:40] we know that
[1:11:43] how do we know he loves us
[1:11:46] because he said so
[1:11:48] how do we know we have eternal life
[1:11:50] because he said so
[1:11:52] how do we know that we are who we
[1:11:54] believe we are
[1:11:57] he said it
[1:11:59] and I just keep going back to that thing
[1:12:01] when I had that conversation with the
[1:12:02] devil I just believe I did I don't know
[1:12:04] how many others out there do but you
[1:12:07] know when he says who said
[1:12:09] I am said I am
[1:12:11] that's all
[1:12:13] and and there's nobody else
[1:12:15] I am
[1:12:17] the beginning the end the alpha the
[1:12:19] Omega the first and the last in one one
[1:12:23] word m
[1:12:25] present tense I am what a what an
[1:12:27] amazing thing that is
[1:12:29] it's tremendous
[1:12:31] the word itself is Spirit brothers and
[1:12:33] sisters it's spirit in word form and
[1:12:36] then you see when it's quickened or
[1:12:38] brought to life
[1:12:39] when we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost we have that Revelation in our
[1:12:43] lives the spirit of the word goes to
[1:12:46] work and acts
[1:12:48] it does every single time
[1:12:51] not just sometimes but every time
[1:12:53] and as Believers it can be really
[1:12:55] difficult to not get caught up in a
[1:12:57] situation and actually utter words that
[1:12:59] we shouldn't utter say things that we
[1:13:01] shouldn't say I think we talked about it
[1:13:04] on Sunday if you want to see a situation
[1:13:05] change just talk positive start to speak
[1:13:08] positive the world is totally tapped
[1:13:10] into this but sometimes as as brothers
[1:13:13] and sisters it can be tough to actually
[1:13:16] not get caught up in in Satan's game
[1:13:20] I don't think we do necessarily I know I
[1:13:23] have
[1:13:25] and you have to go and make it right
[1:13:26] again you have to go and say you know
[1:13:28] brother I don't don't really think it's
[1:13:29] right but I said this and
[1:13:32] you know
[1:13:33] will you forgive me
[1:13:36] but you know brothers and sisters
[1:13:37] tonight we know that he's chosen the
[1:13:39] weak things of the world to confound the
[1:13:41] things which are Mighty and the base
[1:13:43] things of the world
[1:13:46] and the things which are despised hath
[1:13:49] God chosen
[1:13:50] yay and the things which are not
[1:13:54] to bring to naught those things that are
[1:13:58] and and and the things which are not
[1:14:01] n-o-t
[1:14:04] is uh things that just aren't
[1:14:07] being able to say that you know
[1:14:11] I just don't have this or or this hasn't
[1:14:14] happened it hasn't materialized in my
[1:14:16] life yet it's like a brother or a sister
[1:14:19] who is looking for a mate a husband or a
[1:14:23] wife
[1:14:23] to say that I have not found that person
[1:14:27] yet
[1:14:28] but you know what there is a person for
[1:14:31] each and every one of us
[1:14:33] and and there's a whole I mean I'm not
[1:14:35] going to get into that tonight but what
[1:14:37] I'm saying is the word not in this
[1:14:39] scripture is not it's something that
[1:14:41] isn't quite yet
[1:14:43] but
[1:14:44] we're going to speak those things by
[1:14:46] faith and that's what they're talking
[1:14:48] about here what Paul is talking about
[1:14:49] the things which are despised hath God
[1:14:52] chosen yea and things which are not
[1:14:56] you know how Abraham called the things
[1:14:58] that weren't as though they were and the
[1:15:00] things that were as though they weren't
[1:15:02] it just totally lines up with this
[1:15:04] scripture here because the next part of
[1:15:06] it is to bring to not n o u g h t the
[1:15:10] things that are to actually see those
[1:15:12] things diminish to see them actually
[1:15:15] disappear it's interesting
[1:15:18] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:15:21] presence not one of us has anything to
[1:15:23] bring to the Lord not none of us has any
[1:15:26] glory to bring
[1:15:28] but of him
[1:15:30] are ye in Christ Jesus
[1:15:32] who of God is made unto us wisdom and
[1:15:35] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:15:37] Redemption who who the entire plan of
[1:15:40] God through Jesus Christ has made all of
[1:15:43] us Worthy
[1:15:45] that according as it is written he that
[1:15:48] glorieth let him glory in the Lord
[1:15:52] that's the only thing we have to glory
[1:15:54] in brothers and sisters
[1:15:57] he goes on to say
[1:16:00] in Chapter 2 and my speech and preaching
[1:16:02] was not with the enticing words of man's
[1:16:05] Wisdom
[1:16:06] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:16:09] in power remember the word itself is
[1:16:12] Spirit
[1:16:14] where's that power
[1:16:16] when that word
[1:16:18] that spirit is on the lips of his
[1:16:20] children
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:24] Paul didn't come to them with the
[1:16:25] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:16:27] the demonstration of the spirit and
[1:16:28] Empower that your faith should not stand
[1:16:31] in the wisdom of men
[1:16:32] but in the power of God how be it we
[1:16:36] speak of wisdom among them that are
[1:16:39] perfect
[1:16:40] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[1:16:43] the princes of this world that come to
[1:16:45] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:16:49] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:16:52] ordained before the world
[1:16:56] unto our Glory
[1:16:59] that wisdom he's ordained unto our Glory
[1:17:04] which none of the princes of this world
[1:17:06] knew for had they known it they would
[1:17:08] not have crucified the Lord of Glory
[1:17:14] just want to read these two verses here
[1:17:16] the next two because
[1:17:20] I don't know I just feel it's where the
[1:17:22] Lord took me tonight but as it is
[1:17:24] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[1:17:28] neither
[1:17:30] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:17:32] things which God hath prepared
[1:17:37] for them that love him
[1:17:40] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:17:43] his spirit
[1:17:45] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:17:48] the Deep things of God
[1:17:53] tonight I I just wanted to read a quote
[1:17:56] I can't even explain it to you
[1:18:00] um
[1:18:01] other than it's the leadership of the
[1:18:03] Lord
[1:18:04] brother miles do we have
[1:18:06] feedback on the speaker
[1:18:08] sounds like the monitor's got some
[1:18:09] static I don't know that might even be
[1:18:11] coming through
[1:18:13] the home sound
[1:18:17] um anyways
[1:18:18] out of beyond the curtain of time Billy
[1:18:21] Branham says I am more convinced than
[1:18:23] ever in my life
[1:18:25] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:18:28] that place
[1:18:31] there was no jealousy
[1:18:33] no tiredness
[1:18:35] no sickness
[1:18:37] no old age
[1:18:39] no death
[1:18:40] only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:18:47] I feel like we could just stop and take
[1:18:49] a study just on those last two words
[1:18:52] Supreme maybe three Supreme Beauty what
[1:18:55] is that
[1:18:57] and supreme Joy
[1:19:01] a place where there's none of that stuff
[1:19:03] no a perfect place
[1:19:06] no jealousy no tiredness
[1:19:08] who's tired here tonight
[1:19:11] I could raise my hand no sickness no old
[1:19:13] age no death
[1:19:15] only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:19:18] he goes on to say whatever you do
[1:19:22] lay aside everything else
[1:19:25] until you get perfect love
[1:19:29] get to where you can love everybody
[1:19:34] and you know
[1:19:36] I just have to say this there's some
[1:19:38] people that believe that love
[1:19:41] love corrects
[1:19:46] and by actually going out and and
[1:19:48] straightening someone out on whatever it
[1:19:49] is that you feel led to do that for
[1:19:51] you're actually loving them and in some
[1:19:54] cases maybe but you know what save that
[1:19:56] for your children I would say for your
[1:19:58] brothers and your sisters
[1:20:00] just love them
[1:20:02] just just show perfect love that's what
[1:20:05] the prophet's talking about here and if
[1:20:06] we have any questions about what perfect
[1:20:08] love is just look at Jesus in the Bible
[1:20:10] the only ones that he got mad at were
[1:20:12] the most religious people right the most
[1:20:15] Pious ones the ones that were the most
[1:20:17] polished the ones that knew the word the
[1:20:19] best
[1:20:21] the people actually that he loved and
[1:20:23] treated really good were the ones
[1:20:25] actually that nobody else wanted to deal
[1:20:27] with
[1:20:28] he says whatever you do lay aside
[1:20:30] everything else until you get perfect
[1:20:31] love
[1:20:32] get to where you can love everybody even
[1:20:36] your enemy
[1:20:38] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:20:40] lightning is flashing or The Guns of the
[1:20:43] enemy are upon you these things do not
[1:20:46] matter get perfect love
[1:20:50] if you're not saved except Jesus Christ
[1:20:53] as your savior now
[1:20:56] if you've not been baptized in water be
[1:20:58] baptized now
[1:21:01] if you have not received the baptism of
[1:21:04] the spirit the Holy Spirit receive it
[1:21:06] now
[1:21:08] press on in that perfect love which will
[1:21:11] take you to that beautiful and joyful
[1:21:13] place beyond the curtain of time
[1:21:16] Hallelujah glory to God Amen so that's
[1:21:20] such a wonderful thing to think about
[1:21:22] how how he talks about that
[1:21:25] perfect love and really brothers and
[1:21:28] sisters that is the only thing that's
[1:21:29] going to make it there if we think about
[1:21:31] our lives and think about all of the
[1:21:34] theology that we've got and our
[1:21:36] understanding according to the
[1:21:38] traditional teachings of of man even
[1:21:41] about the message of the hour have we
[1:21:43] got perfect love
[1:21:46] because if we don't have perfect love
[1:21:48] then we're lacking something because he
[1:21:50] says that's the only thing that will
[1:21:52] make it there
[1:21:55] I can tell you that I honestly just felt
[1:21:58] so impressed to go this way tonight and
[1:22:00] and I got some news that somebody passed
[1:22:03] away after the leadership for this I
[1:22:06] thought why on Earth Lord are you taking
[1:22:08] me this way
[1:22:10] you know sometimes brothers and sisters
[1:22:11] we get we get blue
[1:22:14] we get sad we get down in our Spirits we
[1:22:17] still are human beings and we live in
[1:22:19] this Human Condition and and sometimes
[1:22:21] we just can't control those things they
[1:22:24] happen especially if we've lost someone
[1:22:26] that we love and I don't think there's
[1:22:28] anybody here that really hasn't lost
[1:22:29] someone that they love in their lives
[1:22:31] everyone has been affected by this but
[1:22:34] you know what
[1:22:36] get perfect love
[1:22:38] because if we get perfect love
[1:22:40] we get to go there
[1:22:42] it's tremendous
[1:22:44] so tonight I'm just going to take a bit
[1:22:47] of time I hope it's okay I'll try and do
[1:22:49] it in 40 minutes
[1:22:52] 45 minutes I want to read the story out
[1:22:55] of beyond the curtain of time
[1:22:57] and how brother Branham describes this
[1:23:01] he says how many never did hear the
[1:23:04] vision of the lord gave me
[1:23:06] let's see your hands up that never
[1:23:08] brother Neville have you got your little
[1:23:09] book there perhaps maybe you would just
[1:23:11] read it for them right here just for the
[1:23:14] next moment or two I believe it right
[1:23:16] here if you will
[1:23:18] remember Brothers and Sisters Perfect
[1:23:20] love is the only thing that's going to
[1:23:22] make it there and that's what he's
[1:23:23] talking about here and and what's
[1:23:24] perfect love gonna demonstrate by it's
[1:23:27] going to be the the word on our lips and
[1:23:29] and knowing that the word that comes out
[1:23:31] of our mouth is spirit it's not just
[1:23:33] words when we speak it's powerful it's
[1:23:37] sharper and quicker and sharper more
[1:23:40] powerful than a two-edged sword right
[1:23:43] Discerning the thoughts
[1:23:45] and the intents of the heart
[1:23:48] but the Branham says right I believe it
[1:23:51] right here if you will
[1:23:53] brother Neville reading the following
[1:23:55] article of brother branham's printed in
[1:23:56] the Full Gospel businessman's voice this
[1:23:59] is out of beyond the curtain of time
[1:24:00] it's a message
[1:24:02] the other morning I was lying on my bed
[1:24:03] I just awoke from sleep and I placed my
[1:24:06] hands behind my head and relaxed with my
[1:24:09] head on the pillow
[1:24:11] then I began to wonder what it will be
[1:24:14] like on the other side
[1:24:16] I realized that I have lived more than
[1:24:20] half my life
[1:24:22] if I live to be as old as my people
[1:24:25] and I wanted to do more for the Lord
[1:24:27] before I left this life
[1:24:30] I think there's probably quite a few
[1:24:32] people that can say Amen to that
[1:24:34] when you look at your life and you think
[1:24:37] about it if you're promised three score
[1:24:39] and ten
[1:24:40] I can say that I almost fit that
[1:24:42] description myself it's amazing to think
[1:24:45] you know how many more years
[1:24:47] we don't know
[1:24:49] he says I Heard a Voice saying you're
[1:24:52] just starting
[1:24:54] press the battle keep pressing
[1:24:58] As I Lay these pondering
[1:25:03] they there pondering these words I
[1:25:05] thought that I just imagined that I
[1:25:08] Heard a Voice and again the voice said
[1:25:11] press the battle keep going keep going
[1:25:16] brother Neville continues to read still
[1:25:19] unbelieving
[1:25:20] I thought that possibly I had spoken the
[1:25:23] words myself
[1:25:26] I placed my my my lips between my teeth
[1:25:30] and held my hand over my mouth I tried
[1:25:32] doing that thinking about it
[1:25:35] huh
[1:25:36] there's no way that you're going to say
[1:25:38] a word
[1:25:39] that's what he says he did I placed my
[1:25:41] lips between my teeth and held my hand
[1:25:43] over my mouth
[1:25:44] and listened The Voice spoke again just
[1:25:47] keep pressing
[1:25:49] if you only knew
[1:25:51] what is that the end of the road
[1:25:55] why
[1:25:56] I seem to hear the music and words of an
[1:25:59] old familiar song
[1:26:02] I sent this out a little while ago I
[1:26:04] would send it out again I listened to it
[1:26:06] over and over again myself it just does
[1:26:08] something for me
[1:26:10] and and
[1:26:11] my goodness I seem to hear the music and
[1:26:14] the words of an old familiar song I'm
[1:26:16] homesick in blue
[1:26:18] and I want to see Jesus I would like to
[1:26:22] hear those arderabelle's chime
[1:26:25] it would brighten my path and banish all
[1:26:28] fears Lord
[1:26:29] let me look past the curtain of time
[1:26:34] then the voice asked
[1:26:36] would you like to see beyond the curtain
[1:26:39] would you like to see beyond the curtain
[1:26:41] I answered it would help me so much
[1:26:46] but the Neville continues to read
[1:26:48] what happened I cannot say whether I was
[1:26:51] in the body or whether it it was a
[1:26:54] translation I do not know
[1:26:58] and I know myself
[1:27:01] I I I I I I I
[1:27:03] heard this story
[1:27:05] myself initially the first time and I
[1:27:08] thought you know maybe I don't know
[1:27:12] but then when you start to see things
[1:27:14] connect like the dots we talked about a
[1:27:17] little earlier
[1:27:18] you can look at situations like this and
[1:27:20] say you know
[1:27:22] Maybe
[1:27:24] for those people who haven't heard this
[1:27:25] story
[1:27:27] you know I would say let's just turn
[1:27:29] over quickly to Second Corinthians it
[1:27:32] should be pretty close
[1:27:34] second Corinthians
[1:27:36] chapter 12.
[1:27:41] just to
[1:27:43] just to bring this out here
[1:27:47] sometimes I think it's many times I
[1:27:49] think it's super important to make sure
[1:27:50] that the you know there's a scriptural
[1:27:52] identity for these things
[1:27:55] so remember he says
[1:27:57] what what happened I cannot say whether
[1:28:00] I was in the body or or whether I it was
[1:28:02] a translation I do not know
[1:28:06] and Paul in in chapter 12 here
[1:28:10] we knew that uh we'll just start with
[1:28:12] verse one it is not expedient for me
[1:28:14] doubtless to Glory I I will come to
[1:28:17] visions and Revelations of the Lord he's
[1:28:19] going to get into this in a little while
[1:28:21] in verse 2 I knew a man in Christ above
[1:28:24] 14 years ago whether in the body I
[1:28:26] cannot tell or whether out of the body I
[1:28:28] cannot tell God knoweth
[1:28:30] such and one caught up to the third
[1:28:32] heaven and I knew such a man whether in
[1:28:35] the body or out of the body I cannot
[1:28:37] tell God knoweth
[1:28:39] how that he was caught up into paradise
[1:28:42] and heard unspeakable Words which is it
[1:28:46] is not lawful for a man to utter
[1:28:50] of such and one will I Glory yet of
[1:28:54] myself I will glory not Glory but in
[1:28:57] mine infirmities and we know he goes on
[1:28:59] to talk about that and I don't want to
[1:29:01] talk about his infirmities today I just
[1:29:03] want to point out the fact that Paul the
[1:29:05] messenger for that age
[1:29:08] for the first church age he had a
[1:29:10] similar experience
[1:29:12] so this isn't really foreign if we look
[1:29:14] at it
[1:29:17] what happened I cannot say brother batam
[1:29:19] says whether I was in the body or
[1:29:20] whether I was it was or whether I it was
[1:29:23] a translation I do not know
[1:29:25] it goes on to say but it was unlike any
[1:29:27] Vision I have ever had how many Visions
[1:29:30] did the prophet have
[1:29:31] that that statement alone is astounding
[1:29:34] to think that he's probably had
[1:29:36] thousands of visions
[1:29:38] you know he's told many of them but how
[1:29:40] many more did he have that he didn't
[1:29:41] speak
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:44] but this one he says this one it was
[1:29:47] unlike any Vision I ever had I could see
[1:29:51] the place to which I was taken and I
[1:29:53] could see myself lying back there upon
[1:29:55] my bed I said this is a strange thing
[1:29:58] could you imagine that
[1:30:00] there were great numbers of people and
[1:30:03] they came running to me crying oh our
[1:30:06] precious brother
[1:30:08] first came young women
[1:30:11] apparently in their early 20s and as
[1:30:14] they would embrace me they said
[1:30:17] our precious brother
[1:30:20] young men in the Brilliance of Young
[1:30:22] Manhood with eyes glistening like stars
[1:30:25] on a darkened night with teeth as white
[1:30:29] as pearls embracing me saying our
[1:30:33] precious brother
[1:30:35] then I noticed
[1:30:37] that I too had become young again
[1:30:41] imagine that brothers and sisters
[1:30:44] this is not just an accidental
[1:30:47] documentation of a vision that someone
[1:30:50] had this is for a purpose
[1:30:53] this is to encourage us I believe that's
[1:30:56] the reason why the Lord took me this way
[1:30:58] tonight if there was one thing that I
[1:31:01] could say I just hope that the Lord
[1:31:02] would encourage Us by this story tonight
[1:31:05] that we would all just leave this
[1:31:07] meeting remembering
[1:31:10] perfect love
[1:31:11] is the only thing that's going to make
[1:31:13] it there and set aside all the stuff in
[1:31:17] our lives
[1:31:18] all the stuff that maybe seems like we
[1:31:20] need to be right or or someone needs to
[1:31:23] be wrong or we need to do or whatever
[1:31:26] none of it matters
[1:31:28] the only thing that matters is perfect
[1:31:29] love
[1:31:30] because that's the only thing that's
[1:31:31] going to make it there he goes on to say
[1:31:34] young men in the Brilliance of their
[1:31:36] manhood with eyes glistening like stars
[1:31:38] on a darkened night
[1:31:40] with teeth as white as pearls embracing
[1:31:42] me saying our precious brother that I
[1:31:45] noticed that I too had had become young
[1:31:48] again
[1:31:49] I looked at myself there
[1:31:51] and turned and look looked back at my
[1:31:54] old body lying there on the bed with my
[1:31:57] hands behind my head I said I don't
[1:31:59] understand this
[1:32:03] as I began to try to comprehend
[1:32:06] the place where I was I began to realize
[1:32:10] that there was no yesterday
[1:32:13] and no tomorrow there
[1:32:17] no one seemed to get tired
[1:32:22] can you imagine that
[1:32:24] no yesterday
[1:32:26] and no tomorrow
[1:32:28] you can't even really get our heads
[1:32:30] wrapped around that no yesterday no
[1:32:32] tomorrow nobody getting tired there
[1:32:36] as a multitude of the most beautiful
[1:32:39] young women I have ever seen through
[1:32:42] their arms around me
[1:32:45] I discovered
[1:32:47] there was only a great love that
[1:32:49] overwhelmed me
[1:32:51] I believe that's that perfect love he
[1:32:52] was talking about right there
[1:32:54] there was only a great love that
[1:32:57] overwhelmed me
[1:32:59] and no physical attraction as in human
[1:33:03] behavior
[1:33:05] I noticed these young women all wore
[1:33:08] their hair down to their waistlines
[1:33:10] and their skirts went down to their feet
[1:33:17] for the Neville continues to read
[1:33:20] after this hope
[1:33:22] my first wife hugged me
[1:33:26] and said
[1:33:27] my precious brother
[1:33:30] then another young woman hugged me
[1:33:32] and hope turned and hugged the young
[1:33:35] woman
[1:33:36] I said I don't understand this this is
[1:33:39] something entirely different from our
[1:33:41] human love
[1:33:43] perfect love
[1:33:45] no jealousy
[1:33:47] no anger no hatred
[1:33:50] no sadness no sorrow no death
[1:33:55] something entirely different from our
[1:33:58] human love
[1:34:01] he said I don't want to go back to that
[1:34:03] old body
[1:34:05] on the bed
[1:34:07] then a voice spoke to me
[1:34:10] this is what you preached that the Holy
[1:34:13] Ghost is
[1:34:15] and I love how it's worded because it's
[1:34:18] not how the Holy Ghost was right
[1:34:20] remember how we said I am the present
[1:34:23] tense how the Holy Ghost is right now
[1:34:26] hey even right now tonight then a voice
[1:34:29] spoke to me this is what you preached
[1:34:31] that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect
[1:34:34] love
[1:34:36] nothing cannot enter here without it
[1:34:40] we know brothers and sisters it's the
[1:34:42] wedding garment it's the token it's the
[1:34:45] Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:34:47] outside of getting the Holy Ghost we
[1:34:49] won't enter that we won't be there
[1:34:52] that's why we can't stop preaching it
[1:34:55] it's it really is the Zeal for the age
[1:34:57] is to repent
[1:34:58] and not just repent but have an outward
[1:35:00] expression of the inward work that
[1:35:02] repentance it causes us to want to do
[1:35:04] everything that the word says that we
[1:35:06] should do if the word says that we
[1:35:07] should get re-baptized in the name of
[1:35:09] the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission
[1:35:10] of our sins even if we've been baptized
[1:35:12] in titles there's something inside us
[1:35:14] that says Amen to the word
[1:35:16] just like Mary said amen to the word
[1:35:18] just like the woman at the well said
[1:35:20] amen to the word
[1:35:22] there's something inside of us that just
[1:35:24] says Amen to the word and we just want
[1:35:26] to follow it and when we do follow it
[1:35:28] brothers and sisters then we get that
[1:35:29] perfect love in our lives and and that's
[1:35:32] what makes it so alarming for the first
[1:35:35] little while when we start coming to
[1:35:36] church and we start to have that
[1:35:38] regeneration
[1:35:40] excuse me that regeneration in our lives
[1:35:43] Things become different we're a new
[1:35:45] creature in Christ Jesus and we look
[1:35:47] around at everyone else and we think
[1:35:49] that everyone else is having the same
[1:35:50] Revival experience and many times the
[1:35:53] people around us have kind of forgotten
[1:35:55] that experience in their own lives
[1:35:57] so we go from the moment of of of coming
[1:36:00] out of sin in the world to being around
[1:36:02] Angels everyone's Angels everyone is the
[1:36:06] same place that I'm at right now tonight
[1:36:08] when I'm revived like that I got perfect
[1:36:10] love for the first time in my life
[1:36:13] but then we start to see The Human Side
[1:36:16] and Satan comes around and says did you
[1:36:17] see what they did you see what they said
[1:36:19] that guy's a Christian that guy's a
[1:36:22] believer
[1:36:23] you know what brothers and sisters
[1:36:24] that's just the devil's trick everyone
[1:36:26] is in that place everyone is having that
[1:36:29] Revival in their own lives but Satan
[1:36:31] comes around and just tries to get
[1:36:33] between us and mix it up and try and
[1:36:35] make us think different things and and
[1:36:37] have different thoughts that's why the
[1:36:39] word gives us a formula an exact formula
[1:36:41] how to deal with things but Satan comes
[1:36:43] around and tries to get us to believe
[1:36:45] that now we're not amongst a bunch of
[1:36:47] Christians we're amongst a few devils
[1:36:49] and that's not the case at all we're
[1:36:52] just dealing with the human nature all
[1:36:54] of us have personalities and we're all
[1:36:57] just trying to make it right trying to
[1:37:00] to press on towards the prize of the
[1:37:03] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus but
[1:37:06] we're contending with this flesh this
[1:37:07] hybrid condition and sometimes we'll say
[1:37:09] things
[1:37:10] sometimes we'll do things
[1:37:12] but you know what happens when we truly
[1:37:15] get perfect love that's when something
[1:37:17] will rise up inside us and say you know
[1:37:19] I I don't think you meant it that way I
[1:37:21] don't think he meant it that way we'll
[1:37:22] go home Angry and we'll wake up in the
[1:37:24] morning and we'll say oh Lord thank you
[1:37:26] for saving me thank you for what you've
[1:37:28] done in my life and you know that thing
[1:37:30] that was bugging me last night I know
[1:37:31] that wasn't them that was just Satan
[1:37:33] trying to get between us and I'm so
[1:37:35] thankful for the Revelation that you've
[1:37:36] given me because I can discern that I've
[1:37:38] been given the ability to discern the
[1:37:40] spirits according to your word I don't
[1:37:42] just get slapped around by Satan I'm
[1:37:44] above that and beyond that I'm a mature
[1:37:47] son and daughter of God I've been
[1:37:48] adopted I've got perfect love in my life
[1:37:52] that's what happens when we get perfect
[1:37:54] love we don't just get slapped around by
[1:37:56] Satan we don't have a a grunt on we
[1:38:00] don't just drag a ball and chain in and
[1:38:02] out of church we heard it said many
[1:38:04] times that people come in with their
[1:38:06] their luggage and they leave with their
[1:38:08] luggage the word says to bring your
[1:38:10] luggage and leave it at the altar
[1:38:12] just just let the the word wash you and
[1:38:15] take away the burden we don't have to
[1:38:17] leave the same way that we came in
[1:38:21] perfect love brothers and sisters
[1:38:23] I'm going to stick on that for a little
[1:38:25] while I don't know why I just believe it
[1:38:27] it's really the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:38:29] token the spirit of Truth
[1:38:32] then a voice spoke to me this is what
[1:38:35] you preached that the Holy Ghost is this
[1:38:38] is perfect love nothing cannot enter
[1:38:42] here without it
[1:38:43] brother Neville continues to read next I
[1:38:46] was taken up and seated on a high place
[1:38:50] this is awesome
[1:38:52] next I was taken up and seated on a high
[1:38:55] place all around me were great numbers
[1:38:57] of men and women
[1:39:00] in the bloom of Youth
[1:39:03] they were crying with joy oh our
[1:39:06] precious brother we are so happy to see
[1:39:10] you here
[1:39:11] I thought
[1:39:13] I'm not dreaming
[1:39:15] for I can see these people
[1:39:18] and I can see my body laying back there
[1:39:20] on the bed can you imagine that being
[1:39:22] able to see those people and then see
[1:39:23] your body there on the bed at the same
[1:39:25] time
[1:39:27] it's amazing
[1:39:29] The Voice spoke to me you know it's
[1:39:32] written in the Bible
[1:39:33] that the prophets were gathered with
[1:39:35] their people
[1:39:37] I said yes I remember that in the
[1:39:39] scriptures
[1:39:42] but there are not this many branhams
[1:39:48] The Voice replied these are not
[1:39:50] branham's these are your these are your
[1:39:53] converts
[1:39:55] the ones you have led to the Lord
[1:40:02] you know how brother Branham tells the
[1:40:04] story I think it's of Wesley Charles
[1:40:07] Wesley
[1:40:08] I could be wrong
[1:40:11] how one woman had the desire
[1:40:14] for a meeting
[1:40:15] to bring the word to people and only one
[1:40:18] person came to the meeting
[1:40:20] and that one person was a man I think it
[1:40:23] was Wesley
[1:40:24] he came and and got saved in the meeting
[1:40:27] the only one that came to the meeting
[1:40:29] that this woman was trying to get
[1:40:31] happening and you know what happened I
[1:40:34] think brother Branham said a million
[1:40:35] people came to Christ through this one
[1:40:37] man
[1:40:38] one person and to think about the
[1:40:41] prophet for this age how many people how
[1:40:43] many really millions of people know the
[1:40:46] message of the hour how many people
[1:40:49] have perfect love
[1:40:53] I believe there could be a lot of people
[1:40:55] there brothers and sisters lots of
[1:40:57] people
[1:40:58] we know there will be based on what he
[1:41:00] says right here
[1:41:01] some of these women
[1:41:03] you think are so young and beautiful
[1:41:05] were more than 90 years old when you led
[1:41:09] them to the Lord
[1:41:12] but now there they are in their
[1:41:14] theophany bodies
[1:41:16] that's what he's seeing is the theophany
[1:41:18] bodies of everyone
[1:41:19] the perfect picture made without spot or
[1:41:22] wrinkle hey
[1:41:24] the way that God created us from before
[1:41:26] the foundation of the world
[1:41:29] he says no wonder they are crying out my
[1:41:32] precious brother
[1:41:34] then the multitude cried together if you
[1:41:36] hadn't gone forth with the gospel
[1:41:39] we wouldn't be here
[1:41:43] what that must do to someone in a
[1:41:47] position like that to think that
[1:41:49] they serve the purpose
[1:41:51] if it wasn't for him being honest with
[1:41:54] the word
[1:41:56] and you know I can't help but think
[1:41:57] about it when when I I read this and
[1:41:59] think about his prayer at the end of the
[1:42:01] seventh seal message
[1:42:03] and if I have to go down to the river
[1:42:05] and the waves start coming in I have to
[1:42:07] lay this old sword down let someone pick
[1:42:09] it up who will be honest with it
[1:42:12] right and and to be able to do that
[1:42:15] means
[1:42:16] that will actually be preaching what
[1:42:18] Paul preached
[1:42:20] we'll be preaching what brother Branham
[1:42:22] preached
[1:42:23] to deviate from it though brothers and
[1:42:25] sisters is going to be
[1:42:27] uh we're missing out
[1:42:31] I asked oh where is Jesus
[1:42:33] I want to see him
[1:42:35] the people replied he's just a little
[1:42:37] higher
[1:42:39] someday he will come to you
[1:42:42] you were sent as a leader and when God
[1:42:45] comes he will judge you according to
[1:42:47] your teaching
[1:42:50] I love how he brings it back to the word
[1:42:53] he says I asked does Paul and Peter have
[1:42:56] to stand this judgment also
[1:42:58] the answer was yes
[1:43:01] nobody is going to be exempt from the
[1:43:04] word but you know he said it there's
[1:43:06] only one thing that he's going to judge
[1:43:08] the World by
[1:43:10] and that's by Jesus Christ which is the
[1:43:12] word
[1:43:13] and the word itself is Spirit
[1:43:17] it's spirit in word form
[1:43:21] I asked us Paul and Peter have to stand
[1:43:23] this judgment also the answer was yes
[1:43:26] he continues to read I said I preached
[1:43:29] what they preached I did not divert from
[1:43:31] it to one side or the other
[1:43:35] where they was baptized in the name of
[1:43:37] Jesus I did it too where they taught the
[1:43:40] baptism of the Holy Spirit I did it too
[1:43:43] whatever they taught I taught also I say
[1:43:47] Lord
[1:43:48] let us teach exactly the same thing
[1:43:51] let us never deviate from that teaching
[1:43:54] let us get to the place where we have
[1:43:56] perfect love in our lives where we don't
[1:43:59] get upset when the the Lightnings
[1:44:01] flashing and the plane is rocking and
[1:44:04] the enemy's guns are are banging away at
[1:44:06] us trying to get us off
[1:44:09] don't worry about it
[1:44:11] if we got perfect love we know who's in
[1:44:13] control
[1:44:14] and and nothing can kill us brothers and
[1:44:16] sisters imagine that you can't even die
[1:44:21] death cannot even touch you if you have
[1:44:25] the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:44:27] if you're a son and daughter of God you
[1:44:29] can no more die than he can die and if
[1:44:31] he can die he's not God
[1:44:34] were they taught the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:36] Spirit I did too and you know myself
[1:44:39] that's all I can say is uh maybe not all
[1:44:42] I can say but when they were baptized in
[1:44:45] the name of Jesus I did too where they
[1:44:46] taught the whole the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:48] Spirit I did too and whatsoever they
[1:44:51] taught I taught also I don't think we
[1:44:53] could ever ever ever ever ever ever
[1:44:54] overestimate
[1:44:58] the importance of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:01] in our lives
[1:45:02] especially based on what he says here
[1:45:05] the people said to him after he said
[1:45:07] those words we know that the people
[1:45:10] cried and we know that we're going back
[1:45:13] to Earth with you sometime
[1:45:16] Jesus will come and judge you according
[1:45:19] to the words you preached us then you
[1:45:22] will present us to him
[1:45:25] and all together we will go back to
[1:45:28] Earth to live forever
[1:45:30] huh
[1:45:33] and thanks be to God that it will be a
[1:45:35] renovated Earth
[1:45:38] it will be all renovated by then
[1:45:42] he says I asked do I have to go back to
[1:45:45] Earth now
[1:45:47] they answered yes
[1:45:49] but keep pressing on
[1:45:52] as I began to move from that
[1:45:56] beautiful
[1:45:57] joyful place
[1:46:01] as far as my eyes could see people were
[1:46:04] coming towards me to embrace me crying
[1:46:07] my precious brother
[1:46:10] can you imagine that just as far as your
[1:46:12] eyes can see people
[1:46:15] suddenly I was back on the bed again I
[1:46:18] said oh God help me
[1:46:21] never let me compromise with the word
[1:46:25] let me stay straight on the word
[1:46:28] I don't care what anyone else does Lord
[1:46:31] let me press on to that beautiful joyful
[1:46:35] place
[1:46:39] and you know
[1:46:40] I'm probably not going to say a whole
[1:46:42] lot more tonight I'll call the musicians
[1:46:44] now
[1:46:45] and I'm just going to read
[1:46:47] a little tiny bit more
[1:46:51] he goes on to say I'm more convinced
[1:46:53] than ever in my life
[1:46:56] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:46:58] that place
[1:47:00] I'm more convinced than ever in my life
[1:47:05] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:47:07] that place
[1:47:09] there was no jealousy
[1:47:11] no tiredness no sickness no old age
[1:47:15] no death
[1:47:17] only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:47:23] says hallelujah
[1:47:25] whatever you do
[1:47:27] lay aside everything else until you get
[1:47:30] perfect love
[1:47:33] it's love how he gives this instruction
[1:47:34] it's not
[1:47:36] it's not nebulous it's not unclear
[1:47:40] it's not confusing
[1:47:42] it's simple
[1:47:44] and and and understandable
[1:47:47] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:47:50] else
[1:47:52] until you get perfect love get to where
[1:47:56] you can love everybody
[1:47:58] even
[1:48:00] every enemy
[1:48:03] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:48:05] lightning is flashing or The Guns of the
[1:48:07] enemy are upon you
[1:48:10] these things do not matter
[1:48:12] get perfect love
[1:48:15] if you're not saved
[1:48:17] accept Jesus Christ as your savior now
[1:48:21] if you have not been baptized in water
[1:48:24] be baptized now
[1:48:28] if you have not received the baptism of
[1:48:30] the Holy Spirit
[1:48:31] I love what he says here
[1:48:34] receive it now
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:37] he doesn't say get it no because it's
[1:48:39] not something that you go out and get
[1:48:42] but you simply receive it
[1:48:44] once you've met the requirements
[1:48:47] just receive it now
[1:48:50] press on in that perfect love
[1:48:53] which will take you to that beautiful
[1:48:55] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[1:48:59] time Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:49:03] maybe stand with me tonight
[1:49:07] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:49:09] Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for
[1:49:12] your word so thankful for the word that
[1:49:14] you would give to us Lord that would be
[1:49:16] spirit in print form Lord Jesus to know
[1:49:20] that you have chosen the the base things
[1:49:24] of this world to express yourself in
[1:49:27] Lord Jesus the the simple things in this
[1:49:31] life Lord you haven't chosen the great
[1:49:34] things to express yourself in and
[1:49:36] through
[1:49:37] Lord I believe that's how every one of
[1:49:40] us feel
[1:49:41] when when we get your true Holy Spirit
[1:49:44] In Our Lives it causes a true humility
[1:49:46] because we recognize that there's
[1:49:48] nothing that we could ever have done
[1:49:51] to Merit your favor
[1:49:53] it's only by your grace that we're saved
[1:49:56] through faith
[1:49:58] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:50:03] only your Amazing Grace Lord
