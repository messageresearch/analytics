[1:05:58] Matthew chapter
[1:06:02] 15 if you could tweak me a little bit in
[1:06:05] the
[1:06:08] monitors give me a a little bit more
[1:06:11] volume by the grace of God
[1:06:14] Amen guess you can adjust as I get
[1:06:19] going
[1:06:20] Matthew
[1:06:23] chapter 15
[1:06:34] start at verse
[1:06:36] one Matthew 15 And1 if you have it say
[1:06:39] amen amen the Bible says then came to
[1:06:44] Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were
[1:06:47] of Jerusalem saying why do the disciples
[1:06:50] transgress the the traditions of the
[1:06:53] elders for they washed not their hands
[1:06:57] when they eat bread but he answered and
[1:07:00] said unto them why do ye also transgress
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:06] Commandments of God by your traditions
[1:07:10] for God commanded saying honor thy
[1:07:12] father and mother and he that curseth
[1:07:16] father or mother let him die to death
[1:07:21] but ye say whosoever shall say of his
[1:07:25] father father or his mother it is a gift
[1:07:29] by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
[1:07:33] by me and honor not his father or mother
[1:07:38] shall be free thus have ye made the
[1:07:41] Commandment of God of none effect by
[1:07:44] your
[1:07:45] Traditions ye Hypocrites well did isas
[1:07:49] prophesy of you saying this people dwell
[1:07:53] draweth not unto me with their
[1:07:56] mouth and honth me with their lips but
[1:08:00] their heart is far from me but in
[1:08:04] vain they do worship me teaching for
[1:08:08] doctrines the Commandments of men oh
[1:08:14] my may the Lord a bless reading of his
[1:08:16] word you can have your seats amen praise
[1:08:21] God I just want to uh quote this verse
[1:08:25] of of scripture while you're sitting
[1:08:28] Hebrews chap 4: 2 the Bible says For
[1:08:31] unto us the gospel preach as well as
[1:08:35] unto them but the word preach did not
[1:08:39] profit them not being mixed with
[1:08:42] faith in them that heard it
[1:08:46] amen you know by the by the grace of God
[1:08:49] tonight uh I want to use for a
[1:08:52] subject fundamental people with
[1:08:55] Pentecostal Faith amen fundamental
[1:08:59] people with Pentecostal Faith you know
[1:09:04] and what uh and we may have heard that
[1:09:08] term used before cuz the the prophet of
[1:09:10] God he talked about it but you know I
[1:09:12] was listening to a message and it just
[1:09:14] kind of jumped out at me you know to
[1:09:17] really look at that
[1:09:19] fundamentalism and
[1:09:21] Pentecostalism and you know uh the way
[1:09:24] it's to stbe there's nothing wrong with
[1:09:26] being
[1:09:27] fundamental and there's nothing wrong
[1:09:29] with being Pentecostal by experience but
[1:09:33] then the prophet goes on to say he says
[1:09:35] in my travels I find two kind of two
[1:09:38] classes of people amen not just two kind
[1:09:42] of people two classes of people so when
[1:09:45] you think about class that means
[1:09:46] something's being taught amen talk to me
[1:09:49] Church something is being taught when
[1:09:52] you go to class when you go to math
[1:09:53] class math is being taught taught when
[1:09:56] you go to English class English is being
[1:09:58] taught so whatever that class is being
[1:10:01] whatever's being taught of that class
[1:10:03] that's what will be developed of those
[1:10:05] students amen and you know the prophet
[1:10:07] of God say I see two classes within the
[1:10:10] within the church amen how many know
[1:10:12] that the church is supposed to be
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:15] one amen and he says I see a a
[1:10:19] fundamental Church Hallelujah and I see
[1:10:22] a Pentecostal people amen and you know
[1:10:25] if we just take the term fundamental
[1:10:27] Hallelujah if we look at the Sadducees
[1:10:30] and Pharisees they were fundamental
[1:10:33] people
[1:10:34] hallelujah they were uh per se Believers
[1:10:37] in the word because they tried to live
[1:10:40] what was revealed to them amen and
[1:10:43] there's nothing wrong with living was
[1:10:45] revealed to you but our problem is is
[1:10:48] when we put a period behind it right
[1:10:52] when we are to put a Karma behind it
[1:10:54] because if you put a period behind it
[1:10:57] you never leave room for growth
[1:10:59] Hallelujah but you'll be
[1:11:02] fundamental you you you you you you'll
[1:11:04] hear the word and and you will legally
[1:11:08] try to do what's right you know you will
[1:11:11] dot your eyes and cross your tees
[1:11:13] legally like the Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:11:15] did H they wasn't just uhuh running the
[1:11:19] streets and running women and adulterers
[1:11:21] and all that stuff no church they had on
[1:11:24] cloth call for loteries with the word
[1:11:27] written all over their clothes amen and
[1:11:29] the prophet of God said that these
[1:11:31] Sadducees and Pharisees you couldn't put
[1:11:33] a finger on their life Hallelujah as far
[1:11:36] as outwardly outwardly showing sin they
[1:11:40] were fundamental Believers Hallelujah
[1:11:43] they took what Moses said and they
[1:11:45] applied it to their lives Hallelujah
[1:11:48] they took what the prophets of old said
[1:11:50] and they applied it to their life they
[1:11:53] were fundamental Believers but when
[1:11:55] Jesus
[1:11:59] came when Jesus came they were so locked
[1:12:03] up in their
[1:12:04] fundamentalism they couldn't receive the
[1:12:06] word by faith that's right amen oh
[1:12:11] my oh my because he didn't come
[1:12:15] Hallelujah the way they thought he ought
[1:12:18] to come why because they had the law
[1:12:21] they had all the dos and don'ts and the
[1:12:24] things you should do and shouldn't do
[1:12:26] amen you know in our churches we have a
[1:12:29] lot of fundamental Believers Hallelujah
[1:12:32] people can tell you what the prophet
[1:12:34] said it when he said it how he said it
[1:12:37] they can quote what church he was in
[1:12:39] what mountain he was on all of that
[1:12:41] stuff but if that's not mixed with faith
[1:12:44] it's no
[1:12:45] good you're just fundamental Hallelujah
[1:12:48] and if all you have is fundamental I'll
[1:12:52] say to you what Christ said to them when
[1:12:54] they came to Christ with their
[1:12:56] fundamental beliefs Christ said to them
[1:12:59] you are of your father the
[1:13:05] devil oh
[1:13:07] my I know I know that one was kind of
[1:13:09] sticky right there huh right so you mean
[1:13:12] to tell me you can live the law of the
[1:13:15] word live a good life have the dos and
[1:13:17] dos and all that things all that mapped
[1:13:20] out and still be amen lost
[1:13:27] amen faith is very important in our walk
[1:13:31] Hallelujah because we can't do it on our
[1:13:34] own we have to trust in God hallelujah
[1:13:38] now if we look at the Sadducees and
[1:13:40] Pharisees I mean the bible say that they
[1:13:43] honored god with their mouth and with
[1:13:45] their lips Hallelujah he said but in
[1:13:47] their hearts in they heart who they
[1:13:50] really was Hallelujah they were
[1:13:52] condemning the very word that was
[1:13:54] revealed
[1:13:57] oh my why because they couldn't
[1:13:59] Hallelujah receive it by faith and
[1:14:03] church uh if I could break it all the
[1:14:05] way back to the beginning of
[1:14:08] fundamentalism you know the prophet of
[1:14:10] God he said that Cain was a fundamental
[1:14:14] believer and so was
[1:14:19] Abel K and Abel both were fundamental
[1:14:23] Brothers they grew up in the same
[1:14:25] household per se had the same parents
[1:14:29] remember I said per
[1:14:31] se because we know the truth
[1:14:34] hallelujah Adam and Eve were there to
[1:14:36] teach these boys what they knew of God
[1:14:39] but then it came a time where they had
[1:14:42] to be more than just fundamental they
[1:14:44] had to go worship and demonstrate to God
[1:14:48] what they really believe amen and the
[1:14:50] prophet of God say what's wrong with the
[1:14:52] fundamental people is positionally they
[1:14:55] know who they are but they have no faith
[1:14:57] to
[1:15:00] demonstrate and you think about how many
[1:15:02] people we know that are in the message
[1:15:04] of the hour and they still putting it
[1:15:07] all on God sent the
[1:15:09] prophet
[1:15:16] amen when there is
[1:15:19] more there is more for us than just
[1:15:23] fundamentally reading the rest of the
[1:15:25] hour and say God did this through a
[1:15:27] prophet God did that through a prophet
[1:15:30] what is he doing through
[1:15:32] you Hall so it's all right to be
[1:15:36] fundamental people but he said
[1:15:38] Hallelujah the difference is the
[1:15:41] fundamental people know who they are
[1:15:43] Hallelujah
[1:15:45] positionally they know their position
[1:15:47] we'll come and we'll say I'm in the
[1:15:49] message of the hour you'll be identified
[1:15:51] with Ser seed you'll be identified with
[1:15:54] with with the opening of the seals
[1:15:56] you'll be identified with the Mighty God
[1:15:58] unveil Hallelujah but when it's time
[1:16:01] Hallelujah to operate in the Unseen you
[1:16:05] go back to your
[1:16:08] law because there's nothing in your life
[1:16:11] Hallelujah that will allow you like God
[1:16:14] told Abraham walk before me and be thy
[1:16:17] perfect amen and you notice in Abraham's
[1:16:20] walk he had to walk Hallelujah in a way
[1:16:24] that he couldn't control Hallelujah his
[1:16:27] journey was all a Journey of Faith
[1:16:29] Hallelujah and when you go look through
[1:16:31] the Bible most of the people God used
[1:16:34] Hallelujah they were fundamental but
[1:16:37] they also had to operate in the
[1:16:42] Unseen
[1:16:44] Hallelujah but if we just look at
[1:16:47] Hallelujah the prophet of God said he
[1:16:48] said they are fundamentally Hallelujah
[1:16:52] knowing their position yeah tonight all
[1:16:55] of us are sa we're daughters and sons of
[1:17:00] God but that won't get you in the heaven
[1:17:04] amen cuz the Baptist say the same thing
[1:17:07] fundamentally and fundamentally they're
[1:17:09] not wrong that's
[1:17:11] right because God is the author of life
[1:17:15] he created the Baptist they just
[1:17:17] dominated behind it I mean yeah they
[1:17:19] just they just turned into a
[1:17:20] denomination behind it Hallelujah you
[1:17:22] can say the same thing about Hall
[1:17:25] the Methodist Hallelujah all those who
[1:17:27] follow the Methodist Doctrine they may
[1:17:29] still have that fundamentally but God
[1:17:32] kept
[1:17:33] moving Hallelujah so you ask yourself
[1:17:36] tonight where are you are you just
[1:17:38] fundamental you got enough Grace to come
[1:17:41] to church and be identified with truth
[1:17:44] being preached amen got to be more than
[1:17:47] that church it got to be more than you
[1:17:50] just sitting in a church of Truth being
[1:17:52] preached cuz think about this and
[1:17:54] everybody that followed Jesus was
[1:17:56] following
[1:17:58] truth and it was only a
[1:18:00] few that could really believe
[1:18:05] it think about the church fundamentally
[1:18:09] Hallelujah he had people walking with
[1:18:11] him witnessing the healing of the sick
[1:18:14] the raising of the Dead the working of
[1:18:16] Miracles and all these things now I'm
[1:18:18] going Jump Ahead Hallelujah they saw all
[1:18:21] these things but when it came time for
[1:18:23] the life
[1:18:26] exactly they walked away but they were
[1:18:30] fundamental
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:34] hallelujah Nicodemus was
[1:18:37] fundamental amen he came to Jesus a good
[1:18:40] Master we know that you're a teacher
[1:18:43] sent from God he came by night there was
[1:18:46] something inside of him agreeing with
[1:18:48] the life he saw on display the same with
[1:18:51] the Rich Young Ruler there was something
[1:18:53] inside agreed with the life we saw he
[1:18:56] said good Master what can I do to
[1:18:58] inherit eternal life and Jesus said keep
[1:19:01] the Commandments and he said I've been
[1:19:03] fundamental all my
[1:19:12] life am I in the
[1:19:17] book when I say the book I mean the
[1:19:21] Bible because fundamental people what
[1:19:23] they'll do is they separate the message
[1:19:26] in the
[1:19:27] Bible say brother bandam said this but I
[1:19:30] just don't quite see it in the Bible and
[1:19:32] the Bible says thisen I just don't quite
[1:19:33] see it in the message no there are not
[1:19:35] two classes of Revelation there's only
[1:19:38] one class of Revelation
[1:19:43] Hallelujah but if you're fundamental we
[1:19:46] was talking about this the other day at
[1:19:47] lunch Hallelujah if you're fundamental
[1:19:49] you might be a person say yeah I believe
[1:19:51] the prophet after 63
[1:19:55] right and I'll say to you you don't
[1:19:59] believe because Jeremiah was a prophet
[1:20:02] in his mother's wool and God didn't
[1:20:05] change that I got a quote for you where
[1:20:08] the prophet of God said none of the
[1:20:10] Visions have ever I've seen have ever
[1:20:12] failed he said even the ones I've seen
[1:20:14] in my mother's
[1:20:18] womb
[1:20:20] W oh
[1:20:22] my oh my God look it up
[1:20:25] Hallelujah but Church being fundamental
[1:20:28] we got to be more than just fundamental
[1:20:32] people with a fundamental
[1:20:34] gospel that'll separate us
[1:20:37] outwardly because the Muslims got us
[1:20:44] beat sisters God bless you we love and
[1:20:48] appreciate what you do for
[1:20:50] God
[1:20:53] but I'm trying to be careful how I say
[1:20:56] this but if you stand next to a devout
[1:21:00] Muslim you will look
[1:21:03] Unholy you ever been in the air you you
[1:21:06] ever been in the airport and you
[1:21:07] standing beside that Muslim brother you
[1:21:09] look at his wife all you see is her
[1:21:12] eyes you a she going to make sure you
[1:21:14] don't get no temptation from
[1:21:16] her Hallelujah and if that's all we got
[1:21:22] fundamentalism they got us
[1:21:26] beat Hallelujah if all you can do is
[1:21:29] just say God sent the prophet you're no
[1:21:31] better than the Jehovah Witness they got
[1:21:33] us
[1:21:35] beat cuz they making their business
[1:21:38] every weekend to catch somebody at
[1:21:41] home when we don't want to open the
[1:21:44] door Hallelujah we don't want to open
[1:21:47] the door but they're faithful to what
[1:21:49] they believe they're very Hallelujah
[1:21:52] fundamental they believe that they are
[1:21:55] Jehovah's Witness Hallelujah but you
[1:21:57] know what I believe it too that I'm
[1:21:59] Jehovah's Witness but I'm going to live
[1:22:02] it by faith not just by giving out
[1:22:06] [Applause]
[1:22:08] tracks because if they don't give out
[1:22:10] them tracks they're no longer identify
[1:22:13] with what they
[1:22:14] believe amen when was the last time you
[1:22:16] gave out a
[1:22:19] track so that mean your Revelation has
[1:22:22] to be something greater catch this it
[1:22:24] has to be something greater than what
[1:22:26] you can
[1:22:32] do
[1:22:34] Hallelujah but I want to read it to you
[1:22:36] just to ease your heart a little bit
[1:22:39] ease your
[1:22:40] mind so you can make sure that this is
[1:22:42] not just Brother D coming up with this
[1:22:44] stuff yeah I study the message I believe
[1:22:47] in the message but I've get I've gotten
[1:22:49] to a place that the revelation of the
[1:22:52] hour Hallelujah
[1:22:55] has to be Vindicated in my
[1:23:01] life I think you need a little help with
[1:23:03] that I'm going help you out the
[1:23:06] revelation of the hour has to be
[1:23:10] Vindicated in our
[1:23:16] lives
[1:23:22] amen and if that's the challenge to you
[1:23:26] I'm going to make it real easy to say
[1:23:31] amen God Is A
[1:23:35] Healer God Is A
[1:23:39] Savior Jesus Christ is the word made
[1:23:44] manifest Hallelujah so we amen because
[1:23:47] we believe and we accept these things by
[1:23:50] faith no I wasn't there when he died on
[1:23:52] the cross but yet I was there by
[1:23:56] faith Hallelujah fundamentally I can't
[1:23:59] prove it fundamentally I can't be
[1:24:02] identify with the death burial and
[1:24:04] Resurrection but by faith I
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:10] can hallelujah hallelujah you know what
[1:24:14] as much
[1:24:15] word that we have heard this should be
[1:24:18] easy to
[1:24:20] say every time the preacher comes out we
[1:24:23] should be
[1:24:25] amen but what we do fundamentally we
[1:24:29] fall back on our own
[1:24:30] natures and our own characters and well
[1:24:33] brother that's just not
[1:24:37] me remember it's by
[1:24:40] faith
[1:24:41] Hallelujah but if you love control you
[1:24:44] will never say Amen you're just
[1:24:47] fundamental and then you'll lean on what
[1:24:50] you can control Hallelujah which will
[1:24:52] later on turn into legalism
[1:24:57] am oh my they shout too much in that
[1:25:00] church legalism hallelujah oh my they
[1:25:03] dress a certain legalism oh my they play
[1:25:06] certain kind of music
[1:25:09] legalism which is just a form of
[1:25:11] Hallelujah fundamentalism with no faith
[1:25:15] because the person that moves into
[1:25:17] Hallelujah fundamentalism with
[1:25:19] Pentecostal Faith you say God bless that
[1:25:21] brother that shout God bless that sister
[1:25:24] that might cry Hallelujah but I'm
[1:25:26] focusing on on what God want me to
[1:25:29] do Hallelujah you don't put out your dos
[1:25:33] and don'ts and your measuring stick why
[1:25:35] because you're living by
[1:25:40] faith amen is kind of
[1:25:44] weak there's enough voices in here to
[1:25:46] make this place
[1:25:48] tremble hallelujah amen do we believe in
[1:25:51] that kind of God Church give you a
[1:25:54] testimony I was in um I was in a uh
[1:25:58] Phoenix about two weeks ago and a
[1:26:01] brother walked up to me after I finished
[1:26:03] preaching and he said Hey Brother uh uh
[1:26:07] you remember the last time you was here
[1:26:09] it's probably a year ago he said you
[1:26:11] remember the last time you was here I
[1:26:12] like yeah he said the last time you was
[1:26:14] here you were praying for me and my wife
[1:26:17] to have a child now I didn't know all
[1:26:20] the Dynamics of it I didn't know you
[1:26:22] know what the doctors had said and all
[1:26:24] these things but Hallelujah I believe
[1:26:26] that we we can lay hands on the sick and
[1:26:28] they can be
[1:26:30] healed Hallelujah fundamentally I
[1:26:33] believe that but going through it is
[1:26:35] something else hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:26:39] he says hey look at this picture I got
[1:26:41] the picture in my phone he showed me a
[1:26:43] picture of me praying for his wife
[1:26:46] Hallelujah I didn't even know he was
[1:26:47] taking a picture HJ to be honest I don't
[1:26:50] even remember praying for her
[1:26:54] Hallelujah I'm just being honest
[1:26:57] hallelujah oh
[1:27:00] my when that Pentecost of Faith meets
[1:27:03] fundamentalism the supernatural takes
[1:27:06] place because fundamental fundamentally
[1:27:09] Hallelujah brother Caron they had a word
[1:27:12] that says hallelujah you can lay hands
[1:27:14] on the secret they'll recover but they
[1:27:16] had to make a step to come and say okay
[1:27:19] now pray for me like the Bible says
[1:27:21] hallelujah and as you step do Hallelujah
[1:27:25] the word mixed with faith you'll get the
[1:27:28] results of what you
[1:27:30] believe church he said we've been
[1:27:33] praying for a child for eight
[1:27:37] years he said in one prayer God answered
[1:27:39] he's the baby right
[1:27:42] here
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:47] hallelujah I feel like doing our whist
[1:27:50] Leisa Hallelujah in the same serice
[1:27:55] another brother came up to me Hallelujah
[1:27:57] and he says Hey Brother digs have you
[1:28:00] met my wife and I was like I guess
[1:28:03] praise God sister how you doing and she
[1:28:05] could barely speak good English you know
[1:28:07] uh it was Spanish by descent and uh he
[1:28:10] said uh my wife and and before I tell
[1:28:14] his testimony you ever get
[1:28:18] discouraged hold up hold up hold up I'm
[1:28:20] going ask that one more
[1:28:22] time Hallelujah
[1:28:26] does anybody here ever get
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] discouraged there's a reason for that
[1:28:33] because God wants to show how great he
[1:28:37] is
[1:28:39] hallelujah hallelujah the discouragement
[1:28:42] is not for us to Fall by the wayside but
[1:28:44] the discouragement is there for us to
[1:28:47] cry out unto God hallelujah so that God
[1:28:50] can vindicate Who We Are
[1:28:54] and I was a little discouraged a couple
[1:28:57] years back you know a little discouraged
[1:29:01] you know just looking on my life and
[1:29:02] finances and all these things and and
[1:29:05] preaching a long time and blah blah blah
[1:29:08] blah we all have our own personal pity
[1:29:11] parties Hallelujah and you know uh I was
[1:29:15] thinking about my testimony and I was
[1:29:17] like what good is it now that's how I
[1:29:20] felt and a sister in my church you know
[1:29:23] how you can watch a sermon on on YouTube
[1:29:26] and you can make a comment about it you
[1:29:29] know what I was thinking about my
[1:29:30] testimony just kind of useless now I've
[1:29:32] been all these years it's like you know
[1:29:34] and she sent me uh in my moment of uh
[1:29:40] distress in my moment of feeling sorry
[1:29:43] for myself she sent me a clip of me
[1:29:46] preaching and the
[1:29:48] comments and the comment and when I was
[1:29:51] preaching I made reference of how God
[1:29:53] healed me from cancer
[1:29:54] and she circled a comment from a sister
[1:29:57] who said I thank God for this message
[1:29:58] because I was just diagnosed with
[1:30:02] cancer
[1:30:04] Hallelujah and you know in the moment
[1:30:06] when you think your life is worthless or
[1:30:08] you think your life is not going the way
[1:30:10] you ought to it's really going according
[1:30:14] to God's
[1:30:19] plan church we got to step out of
[1:30:22] fundamentalism and tell the devil you
[1:30:25] are not in
[1:30:26] control God is in
[1:30:29] control Church it doesn't matter what
[1:30:31] you go through you lose your house your
[1:30:33] cars you get sick in your body
[1:30:35] relationships mess up you still have to
[1:30:38] testify that God is in control because
[1:30:41] if you don't you're saying the devil
[1:30:46] is hallelujah and I
[1:30:50] refuse to get the devil control of my
[1:30:53] life
[1:30:55] so don't I can come into church walking
[1:30:56] like this and I still say blessed be the
[1:30:58] name of the
[1:31:00] Lord
[1:31:02] hallelujah oh glory to
[1:31:05] God so
[1:31:07] anyway same church come outside brother
[1:31:10] say Brother D you ever met my wife I
[1:31:11] said I don't think so and she was like
[1:31:13] God bless you he said honey tell her
[1:31:15] your testimony and she says he says
[1:31:19] brother she F your
[1:31:21] testimony and then they start to
[1:31:25] scramble in their minds on how they
[1:31:27] found it and neither one of them could
[1:31:30] remember how they came in contact with
[1:31:31] it so she was like I don't know how I
[1:31:34] got it but I got it she said but
[1:31:36] listening to it was what I needed
[1:31:39] because I was just diagnosed with a with
[1:31:41] with something on my brain Hallelujah so
[1:31:45] she listened to the testimony and she
[1:31:48] went to bed Hallelujah believing that if
[1:31:51] God did it for me he could do it for her
[1:31:54] hallelujah hallelujah see that steps out
[1:31:57] of fundamentalism Hallelujah and say God
[1:32:00] see Hallelujah stepping out of
[1:32:02] fundamentalism to say God I'm a son just
[1:32:05] like I'm a daughter just like he's a son
[1:32:08] now I need you to work see this P ACR
[1:32:10] the faith now I need you to do what you
[1:32:12] did for him for
[1:32:14] me Hallelujah see that's the person who
[1:32:17] got the checkbook and the money in the
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:22] bank cuz remember he said Hallelujah
[1:32:25] fundamentalism Hallelujah and
[1:32:27] Pentecostal people he says like one
[1:32:29] having a checkbook and no money and the
[1:32:32] other one is like having the money in no
[1:32:34] checkbook but then he said if I can ever
[1:32:36] get those two people
[1:32:38] together that's who it should
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:46] be they they they pulling real good over
[1:32:49] here that's why I can't get from the
[1:32:50] side y'all y'all got to straighten it

[1:33:01] she
[1:33:03] heard she didn't read a
[1:33:05] scripture she didn't have a a a message
[1:33:08] book all she had was a
[1:33:13] testimony oh my oh my go ahead sometimes
[1:33:19] all we need is a
[1:33:21] testimony Church don't you know that's
[1:33:24] how David defeated God Goliath because
[1:33:27] of his
[1:33:29] testimony it wasn't his weapons it
[1:33:31] wasn't his strength Hallelujah it was
[1:33:33] his Pentecostal
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:37] Faith cuz fundamentally Goliath should
[1:33:39] have
[1:33:41] won but David said I'm a warrior just
[1:33:43] like you
[1:33:44] are and the day she Pentecostal Faith
[1:33:47] steps into the vision of your life and
[1:33:50] David say I'mma cut your head off and
[1:33:52] didn't even have a soul
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] I hope you speaking those things like
[1:34:00] Abraham did that are not as though they
[1:34:02] are Hallelujah that's what fundamental
[1:34:06] people do with Pentecostal Faith they
[1:34:08] speak things into existence Hallelujah
[1:34:11] David said I'mma cut your head off
[1:34:13] didn't even have a sword but did he cut
[1:34:15] his head
[1:34:17] off what he spoke became a reality how
[1:34:21] by faith
[1:34:25] oh my I feel the supernatural presence
[1:34:27] of
[1:34:29] God
[1:34:30] hallelujah she goes to
[1:34:33] bed believing what she
[1:34:36] heard and she's wakened
[1:34:38] up with
[1:34:41] singing she looked at her phone her
[1:34:43] phone was off she's looking in the room
[1:34:46] at everything else where music could
[1:34:48] come from everything else was
[1:34:51] aome then God begin to reveal her where
[1:34:54] she was she was in the presence of
[1:34:56] angels
[1:34:59] singing right in her
[1:35:01] room because she believed Hallelujah why
[1:35:06] would Angels worship if God is not
[1:35:13] there that's their job they're obligated
[1:35:17] if angels are singing that mean God is
[1:35:20] there God is there Hallelujah
[1:35:24] prise
[1:35:25] Lord so she was awakened Hallelujah and
[1:35:29] God revealed her you're in the Pres
[1:35:31] angels are singing and worshiping and
[1:35:32] she just sat there and worshiped with
[1:35:34] them Hallelujah then she went back to
[1:35:36] the doctor and it was
[1:35:39] gone
[1:35:41] Hallelujah now I want to show you how
[1:35:44] powerful that is she didn't like the
[1:35:46] other sister she didn't even get a
[1:35:48] chance to get in a prayer
[1:35:51] line that's right
[1:35:54] amen you can believe right there in your
[1:35:58] seat and Pentecostal faith will bring
[1:36:01] what you need to your
[1:36:02] bosom Hallelujah church we are in the
[1:36:06] hour of the
[1:36:08] blending Hallelujah we should be
[1:36:11] Hallelujah recipients of the blending
[1:36:14] what blending fundamentalism and
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:21] Faith don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:36:23] close

[1:36:34] atmosphere Hallelujah I challenge you
[1:36:37] Hallelujah to let God have your spirit
[1:36:40] in the service amen and he'll take you
[1:36:43] out of your seat and you'll realize you
[1:36:45] in Heavenly places right now
[1:36:49] Hallelujah you in Heavenly places right
[1:36:51] now God is here
[1:36:54] somebody I'm I'm challenging you to
[1:36:59] believe but if you're just fundamental
[1:37:02] you're stuck right on this just being a
[1:37:05] Wednesday
[1:37:07] night amen but if you are a part of the
[1:37:10] blending amen hallelujah there's a
[1:37:13] scripture that gives you a right to have
[1:37:16] what you ask for there's a scripture
[1:37:18] that says hallelujah wherever two or
[1:37:21] three of us gather
[1:37:24] Hallelujah wherever two or three of us
[1:37:27] gather Hallelujah Christ said I'm also
[1:37:30] in the midst Hallelujah I'm also in the
[1:37:34] midst that's a
[1:37:36] promise I challenge you to
[1:37:40] believe take your burdens to the Lord
[1:37:44] God's not done hallelujah he just want
[1:37:46] you to continue to be salty Hallelujah
[1:37:49] and he'll give you your heart's
[1:37:51] desire oh
[1:37:54] Hallelujah this ain't a time to worry
[1:37:57] this is a time to
[1:38:03] blendall we talk sicknesses too long we
[1:38:06] T doubt too long why because we're
[1:38:09] living in
[1:38:13] fundamentalism
[1:38:15] listen
[1:38:17] Hallelujah
[1:38:19] church I'm going just read a couple
[1:38:21] things so you can so you can grasp it
[1:38:24] the prophet of God said he said the
[1:38:27] trouble of it is that I found and I said
[1:38:30] the other night
[1:38:32] Hallelujah two different classes of
[1:38:35] people hallelujah one of them is
[1:38:38] fundamentalist positionally they know
[1:38:40] what they are the next is Pentecostals
[1:38:43] the fundamentalist and the Pentecostals
[1:38:44] the Pentecostals have the faith
[1:38:47] Hallelujah but they don't know who they
[1:38:50] areen
[1:38:56] oh if you that person spiritually I wish
[1:38:59] I could slap you across the
[1:39:03] head because you got
[1:39:06] faith to believe in God but then when
[1:39:10] another trial comes you start to
[1:39:12] wonder who am
[1:39:14] I why do I keep going through this I'll
[1:39:18] tell you let's settle it the reason why
[1:39:20] you keep going through it is because God
[1:39:22] is perect perfecting
[1:39:24] you it's not that you're not a son or a
[1:39:27] daughter he's just perfecting you
[1:39:30] Hallelujah so Hallelujah bring your
[1:39:33] fundamentalism along and show
[1:39:36] positionally you know who you are cuz
[1:39:39] remember Hallelujah the prophet of God
[1:39:41] said Jesus defeated the devil simply by
[1:39:45] knowing who he
[1:39:49] was he knew that there were scriptures
[1:39:52] that didn't apply to him
[1:39:54] and then there were scriptures that
[1:39:57] were or should I say things they wanted
[1:40:00] to do in the scriptures that didn't
[1:40:02] apply to Him Sister sh they say you know
[1:40:04] what they were offended at his Doctrine
[1:40:09] Hallelujah cuz he was fundamental but
[1:40:11] his life went another level Hallelujah
[1:40:14] to they couldn't see on
[1:40:17] paper they couldn't prove it by paper H
[1:40:20] you see what they ask say why they why
[1:40:22] why they don't wash their hands when
[1:40:24] they
[1:40:26] eat like they say in Trinidad
[1:40:31] stupidness stupidness they worried about
[1:40:33] them washing their
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:37] hands and Jesus is basically why they
[1:40:40] got to wash their hands when Holiness is
[1:40:41] with
[1:40:43] them when righteousness is with them
[1:40:46] they don't have to wash their hands
[1:40:48] hallah because I'm with them Hallelujah
[1:40:50] the one that can make them whole and
[1:40:51] clean is with them they're eating with
[1:40:55] me they don't have to worry about these
[1:40:57] things on the outside hallelujah
[1:41:00] hallelujah oh my church when you when
[1:41:03] you look at it and you think about it
[1:41:05] Hallelujah the the the fundamentalism
[1:41:07] and you look in the Bible fundamentalism
[1:41:09] is very
[1:41:12] dangerous true
[1:41:18] right everybody all right
[1:41:24] the greatest fundamental example one of
[1:41:26] the greatest fundamental examples we
[1:41:28] have is Cain and
[1:41:32] Abel cuz the time comes where these boys
[1:41:34] got to go worship to
[1:41:36] God think about it they grew up in a
[1:41:40] house where Mom and
[1:41:43] Dad didn't wrestle with the voice of
[1:41:49] God they knew what God looked like
[1:41:57] H they can understand his presence and
[1:42:00] his touch H cuz remember when sin came
[1:42:03] in they said that he came down in the
[1:42:05] cool of day his presence and they start
[1:42:07] to run Hallelujah you couldn't fool Adam
[1:42:10] and
[1:42:11] Eve Hallelujah and those were the
[1:42:13] teachings that they these boys were
[1:42:15] raised up on Hallelujah fundamental
[1:42:22] teachings but then came a place when it
[1:42:25] said okay we've done all we could do
[1:42:29] Hallelujah sometimes you do all you can
[1:42:31] do amen The Next Step belongs to
[1:42:36] God hallelujah cuz remember Hallelujah
[1:42:39] God LED Joshua to the Jordan when the
[1:42:41] banks were at his
[1:42:43] highest why cuz he wanted to show Joshua
[1:42:46] you have the faith to speak to the banks
[1:42:50] Hallelujah you have the faith to step
[1:42:52] into the water and the water will move
[1:42:55] Hallelujah just like Moses Church did
[1:42:58] it's still the same
[1:43:01] fa Hallelujah but we so busy Hallelujah
[1:43:06] talking to the devil talking to the
[1:43:07] devil the devil is the devil that the
[1:43:09] devil is no right amen speak to the
[1:43:12] situation
[1:43:14] amen whatever's in front of you or
[1:43:16] behind you that's bothering you speak to
[1:43:18] it amen yes
[1:43:20] Hallelujah cuz fundamentally he couldn't
[1:43:23] could go forward they couldn't go
[1:43:25] sideways and Pharaoh was behind them and
[1:43:29] then they start crying they start
[1:43:30] weeping oh we going to die we supposed
[1:43:33] to die because Pharaoh is behind us and
[1:43:35] we didn't left we supposed to die
[1:43:37] fundamentally we're not strong enough
[1:43:40] Moses crying they crying God say shut
[1:43:47] up right stop all that
[1:43:51] cry and look
[1:43:53] what fundamentalism will
[1:43:55] do it'll make you lose focus in what God
[1:43:58] has already
[1:44:02] done because positionally you be like
[1:44:05] yeah I'm a child but then because you
[1:44:08] haven't tapped into the the realm of the
[1:44:10] faith yeah you didn't realize that if
[1:44:12] God did it before he can do it again
[1:44:14] Hallelujah so look there at the red SE
[1:44:17] and they crying think about it Church
[1:44:19] what they should have did was said how
[1:44:21] do we even get here to the Red Sea
[1:44:23] amen we got here because of the grace of
[1:44:26] God we got here because of the power of
[1:44:28] God God created frogs Li Hallelujah turn
[1:44:32] uh water into blood all these things
[1:44:34] Hallelujah they should have they should
[1:44:36] have got to that sea and everybody
[1:44:38] should have start praying say Lord we
[1:44:40] don't know how we here we don't know
[1:44:42] what's going to happen but we
[1:44:46] believe that's what we ought to be
[1:44:48] saying right now in the midst of our
[1:44:50] trial God I don't know why it's like
[1:44:53] this I don't know why I'm here but
[1:44:55] father I
[1:44:57] believe that you are more than able to

[1:50:11] he just commune with them and talk with
[1:50:13] them Hallelujah Church they were not
[1:50:15] like us they were not confused with the
[1:50:17] voice of
[1:50:18] God
[1:50:21] Amen oh
[1:50:23] somebody could be sitting here right now
[1:50:25] in the seat of the fundamental saying oh

[1:50:33] Dan I can't do nothing for you but it's
[1:50:36] spiritually Hallelujah and divinely by
[1:50:39] faith you're making a connection you're
[1:50:41] connecting with
[1:50:46] Jehovah
[1:50:48] Hallelujah think about it Church
[1:50:50] Hallelujah it was to sin came in that
[1:50:54] they started running from

[1:51:17] Adam didn't receive of the same
[1:51:19] Revelation everything is all messed up
[1:51:22] they ran from God hallelujah but because
[1:51:25] of who they
[1:51:26] were Amen in God's eyes Hallelujah sin
[1:51:31] still couldn't stop them from hearing
[1:51:33] the voice of
[1:51:36] God even with the greatest sin ever
[1:51:39] created Hallelujah they still heard God
[1:51:42] calling their
[1:51:44] name so I don't care where your child
[1:51:47] may be or what they may be into if you
[1:51:50] did your job fundamentally to rais them
[1:51:53] up in the way that they should go
[1:51:55] Hallelujah now it's time to step into
[1:51:57] the
[1:51:59] Unseen now it's time to step into the
[1:52:02] Unseen and say God I did my part now I'm

[1:52:41] Moses that one time now he let him get
[1:52:43] in the same
[1:52:45] situation and he's still
[1:52:47] fundamental

[1:54:01] Hallelujah Moses crying about this and
[1:54:03] that and God elevates his faith and he
[1:54:05] says hey you be God to the
[1:54:09] people day and Moses goes down to Egypt

[1:58:05] just to steal a fire amen
[1:58:09] hallelujah church one thing I want to
[1:58:11] hit before I get out of here everybody
[1:58:13] all
[1:58:14] right
[1:58:16] listen if you're just
[1:58:19] fundamental I want to show some things
[1:58:22] you're capable of just being
[1:58:25] fundamental and it'll come out when you
[1:58:27] least expect it Hallelujah God saidh the
[1:58:31] prophet God said if all God requir is
[1:58:35] fundamentalism Abel was no better than
[1:58:40] Cain if that's all was
[1:58:43] required in the
[1:58:46] worship Hallelujah Church they come to
[1:58:50] worship we know the story Abel is
[1:58:53] received Cain is
[1:58:55] rejected now God comes and he starts to
[1:58:59] say to Cain who was fundamental the
[1:59:01] prophet of God said he was a
[1:59:05] Believer he wasn't an unbeliever he was
[1:59:08] a
[1:59:09] Believer I'mma shock you for a second
[1:59:11] don't you know that Satan the Devil the
[1:59:14] dragon Lucifer is a
[1:59:19] Believer his whole life is surrounded
[1:59:23] around being who God
[1:59:29] is he's not trying to be the opposite of
[1:59:32] God he's trying to be the very thing God
[1:59:35] is he's a
[1:59:40] Believer but God won't share his
[1:59:43] glory with somebody who's trying to take
[1:59:45] his
[1:59:48] seat that's what made it iniquity
[1:59:51] because Satan wanted to replace
[1:59:54] God see God will let us be equal with
[1:59:56] him but we're not trying to replace him
[1:59:59] H his glory is hidden and revealed in
[2:00:02] us that's why we can be one with him
[2:00:05] it's just like he said when you see the
[2:00:06] wife you see the husband why because
[2:00:08] it's one
[2:00:10] Glory Hallelujah that's why Jesus would
[2:00:12] say hallelujah when you see me you see
[2:00:15] the father Hallelujah because it's not
[2:00:17] two entities it's oneall
[2:00:22] yes church but K he comes and he worship
[2:00:25] he's rejected and he's fundamental he's
[2:00:28] a Believer Hallelujah now God comes and
[2:00:30] he says to a he says to Cain where's thy
[2:00:33] brother now I'm going to show you what
[2:00:34] fundamentalism people can do they can
[2:00:36] look God's spirit right in the face and
[2:00:40] lie
[2:00:43] wow am I in the
[2:00:48] book can't gets Arrogant with God
[2:00:52] Hallelujah the ministry will preach
[2:00:54] something right down the lines of your
[2:00:56] life and you'll get upset and get
[2:00:58] Arrogant with the
[2:01:00] preacher if you're just
[2:01:04] fundamental you know one one one of one
[2:01:07] of our greatest problems
[2:01:09] is one of our greatest problems in the
[2:01:12] in the in the message in our ranks is
[2:01:15] that you have access to the same thing
[2:01:18] I'm
[2:01:19] studying right so it ain't no Miss
[2:01:22] history I can read something and you can
[2:01:24] read the same thing and God can reveal
[2:01:26] it to you just like he can reveal it to
[2:01:28] me and if you don't know where you are
[2:01:31] in the economy of God you'll try to take
[2:01:34] my
[2:01:35] place when what I'm doing is by gift not
[2:01:38] by knowledge and that's what happened to
[2:01:41] people in the church because you have
[2:01:43] the same material you have no respect
[2:01:46] for the gift
[2:01:52] I'm going show you what that's like
[2:01:54] Hallelujah God giving us Revelation and
[2:01:56] then us telling us we don't need
[2:02:00] God because it's revealed to us my the
[2:02:05] hypocrisy but look Church came he Oh my
[2:02:09] he says to God am I My Brother's
[2:02:13] Keeper he saids I don't know what
[2:02:15] happened to him and God says his blood
[2:02:18] is crying out is speaking is hollering
[2:02:20] from the ground God is saying I know
[2:02:23] what you did and K sits there and deny
[2:02:26] it all gets mad at God but this is the
[2:02:29] key fundamentalism Hallelujah will know
[2:02:33] the way and still won't
[2:02:36] go cuz he says to King if you do like
[2:02:39] your brother you'll be accepted can't
[2:02:41] walked out of his presence that's what
[2:02:43] fundamental people will do Hallelujah
[2:02:46] they'll know the way but because they
[2:02:48] don't have Pentecost of Faith to follow
[2:02:50] they will not follow
[2:02:52] same thing Judas did Hallelujah he would
[2:02:55] not go to the upper room that's right
[2:03:04] right he lied he got
[2:03:08] arrogant and he rejected the
[2:03:11] way that's what fundamental people do in
[2:03:13] the church they're sitting the church
[2:03:15] for years they don't know the doctrine
[2:03:17] of the church they don't know the quotes
[2:03:19] the message of the hour but have no
[2:03:22] hunger for the mind of God the will of
[2:03:26] God the life of God they're just
[2:03:29] satisfied sitting in the
[2:03:34] Shell but you know
[2:03:36] what an Arona not don't go through all
[2:03:38] that training to remain on Earth
[2:03:42] amen Glory
[2:03:45] Hallelujah he don't go through all that
[2:03:47] training and study the stars and the
[2:03:49] moons and the planets and all that stuff
[2:03:52] not to take a trip amen into a land or a
[2:03:56] place naturally he doesn't
[2:04:00] belong Hallelujah and God has not giving
[2:04:04] us this Revelation this word for us to
[2:04:07] remain Earth Bound in our
[2:04:14] faith so a fundamental
[2:04:17] person can know truth believe in truth
[2:04:22] truth
[2:04:23] hallelujah even say I know who I
[2:04:27] am and still won't go all the
[2:04:33] way but let's look at
[2:04:35] Abel what separated the
[2:04:39] two same
[2:04:41] house same
[2:04:44] teachings but able was willing to
[2:04:47] surrender
[2:04:48] himself to what was next am yes
[2:04:53] amen Hall look you can't control what's
[2:04:57] next Just Surrender to Hallelujah God's
[2:05:01] Will and look Church in him surrendering
[2:05:05] Hallelujah he surrendered in his worship
[2:05:08] and God took him to a place that hadn't
[2:05:10] even been revealed on Earth yet
[2:05:16] got he grabs a lamb or whatever it was
[2:05:20] and he starts to up in blood is flying
[2:05:23] everywhere in his worship what was it
[2:05:25] God was taking him to the
[2:05:27] Cross before he even died on the
[2:05:34] cross oh my that's what P cost Faith
[2:05:38] would do amen just like job in the midst
[2:05:41] of his trial fundamentally he done
[2:05:43] nothing wrong but his faith said
[2:05:45] Hallelujah I know my redeemer
[2:05:48] liveing and I will see him again
[2:05:51] [Applause]
[2:05:54] amen the Lord God give it and the Lord
[2:05:57] God taketh
[2:05:59] away that's the attitude we ought to
[2:06:01] have and everybody else around him who's
[2:06:04] fundamental is criticizing him you know
[2:06:06] the problem is we got too many eleases
[2:06:09] in the
[2:06:10] church that one of Joseph one of Joe's
[2:06:13] friends elast
[2:06:16] Joe how long are you going to hold on to
[2:06:19] your integrity for as long is in
[2:06:24] tank I don't care what you think you
[2:06:28] know all I know is God is in control and
[2:06:32] blessed be the name of the
[2:06:38] Lord
[2:06:40] listen there's so much in
[2:06:44] here so much in this I'm trying to get
[2:06:48] out but you guys are pulling h
[2:06:52] I wanted to read Matthew
[2:06:54] 8 because it shows the transition from
[2:06:57] somebody who is
[2:07:00] fundamental to having Pentecostal
[2:07:03] faith and the story is the Centurion
[2:07:07] hallelujah oh
[2:07:09] my what's the story of the
[2:07:11] Centurion he heard about Jesus and all
[2:07:14] the things that Jesus done and then he
[2:07:16] sit down and said master I want you to
[2:07:18] uh uh first he said come to my house I
[2:07:21] got somebody sick but then it click
[2:07:23] Hallelujah he said you know
[2:07:27] what I am a
[2:07:29] man of like passions as you
[2:07:35] are oh my what does Pentecost of Faith

[2:07:47] you what did his interior see
[2:07:51] he said when I say go they go when I say
[2:07:54] come they come when I say do they do now
[2:07:57] God just speak the
[2:08:01] word just speak the word and it'll
[2:08:04] suffice just speak the word and the
[2:08:06] Bible says hallelujah Jesus Hallelujah
[2:08:09] was excited about that Faith Hallelujah
[2:08:12] Jesus turned him around and he began to
[2:08:14] point them out to the whole church and
[2:08:16] he said y'all see this I've haven't seen
[2:08:19] this kind of Faith No Way in
[2:08:24] Israel God is looking for not just
[2:08:26] Believers but Believers of
[2:08:30] vision that all things are
[2:08:39] possible Gentile
[2:08:44] Faith that's what the Centurion was amen
[2:08:48] Gentile
[2:08:50] faith we keep going back cuz I want to
[2:08:53] show you you need more than just saying
[2:08:56] I'm a message
[2:08:57] believer because that's who Peter was
[2:09:00] right Peter was a good message believer
[2:09:03] he was Healing The Sick raising the Dead
[2:09:05] doing all these things walking with the
[2:09:07] Lord and then God one place he told me
[2:09:10] he said I want you to feed my sheep he
[2:09:11] said oh yes bless the Lord I will I'll
[2:09:14] preach until the day I can till the day
[2:09:15] I die yes Lord Jesus said you going to
[2:09:17] deny me three
[2:09:19] times no I ain't not me God I believe
[2:09:22] this message not me I don't care what
[2:09:24] come
[2:09:27] fundamental Hallelujah he was
[2:09:29] fundamental until a trial came that he
[2:09:32] couldn't
[2:09:34] bear what's going to get you out of
[2:09:36] those trials you can't
[2:09:38] bear what got Peter on the other side it
[2:09:42] was the Holy
[2:09:45] Ghost so what is Pentecostal Faith the
[2:09:49] Holy Ghost
[2:09:54] Pentecostal faith is the Holy Ghost
[2:09:58] because when the Holy Ghost comes all
[2:10:00] fear is
[2:10:02] gone cuz they went from being afraid on
[2:10:05] the upper room coming down after the
[2:10:07] Holy Ghost fell saying this is that what
[2:10:10] you looking at right here this is
[2:10:15] that I'm the revelation of the Cross I'm
[2:10:19] the revelation of the of the
[2:10:20] Resurrection how the revelation of
[2:10:24] repentance is revealed in me Peter say
[2:10:28] this is that I am the
[2:10:36] restoration when the Holy Ghost
[2:10:39] came it was more than just do and
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:44] don't and that's why the Sadducees and
[2:10:47] Pharisees couldn't receive Christ
[2:10:50] Hallelujah cuz he made their laws look
[2:10:55] stupid they wanted to pinpoint him on
[2:10:58] this and that and it's why he down there
[2:11:00] with the Senators and
[2:11:04] Republicans easy to make people look bad
[2:11:08] and if all you got is just the
[2:11:10] separation of the eye Hallelujah you
[2:11:12] just
[2:11:17] fundamental here come Jesus Jesus comes
[2:11:20] Hallelujah breaking all they
[2:11:23] laws Hallelujah eating corn on the
[2:11:26] Sabbath day doing all kind of
[2:11:30] stuff Hallelujah and they crying you
[2:11:33] eating on the Sabbath day this that
[2:11:35] Jesus say I am the
[2:11:38] Sabbath
[2:11:40] Hallelujah well he was showing him that
[2:11:42] the things you believe in the law is
[2:11:44] just there to get you to the Holy Ghost
[2:11:47] to get you to the to the life Hallelujah
[2:11:52] Church in my
[2:11:55] closing I want to hit this one it's kind
[2:11:57] of going to repeat but I want you to
[2:11:58] catch some of these adjectives real
[2:12:01] quick he said one of the greatest curses
[2:12:04] of the Full Gospel Church is not knowing
[2:12:07] positionally hallelujah what they are in
[2:12:10] Christ Jesus I've always said I've met
[2:12:13] two classes of people one of them is the
[2:12:15] Full Gospel the other is the fundamental
[2:12:17] fundamental knows Hallelujah where he
[2:12:20] standing position
[2:12:21] only he's never been born
[2:12:27] again church and we didn't seen this
[2:12:30] this Ain a mystery we didn't seen people
[2:12:33] preachers been in the message 20 30
[2:12:35] years and then they get a special
[2:12:37] Revelation and they
[2:12:41] G same thing the 120 did
[2:12:46] amen they walk with
[2:12:49] him until he began to speak in ways they
[2:12:54] couldn't legally
[2:12:59] prove oh what about the bridge and what
[2:13:01] about this couldn't be legally proved
[2:13:05] amen amen but we believe it by
[2:13:10] faith and I'll take it a step
[2:13:12] further I don't
[2:13:16] care if there was or wasn't a bridge
[2:13:20] because the whole job of Malachi the mo
[2:13:23] whole job of elaser was to get me to
[2:13:28] Jesus give me to Isaac that's the whole
[2:13:32] job that's right right after Rebecca met
[2:13:35] Isaac she didn't care what was going on
[2:13:38] in her father's
[2:13:41] house she didn't even care about eleasa
[2:13:45] anymore
[2:13:53] Hallelujah but you can't get rid of
[2:13:56] eler because eler is the only one who
[2:13:59] knows the way back to Abraham's
[2:14:06] house that's we got we don't need no
[2:14:09] Prophet God reveal Us in the Bible blah
[2:14:12] blah
[2:14:14] blah
[2:14:16] exactly without a prophet Hallelujah we
[2:14:20] wouldn't know the Mind Of
[2:14:24] God because the word of the Lord comes
[2:14:26] to who to the
[2:14:30] prophet now again you might want me to
[2:14:32] separate that but I ain't because the
[2:14:35] word of the Lord comes to the prophet
[2:14:37] right the word of the Lord comes to the
[2:14:42] prophet but who does the Prophet come
[2:14:46] to comes to us so we're still meeting
[2:14:50] the same
[2:14:51] God hallelujah it's just a different
[2:14:54] Veil we're still hearing the same word
[2:14:58] it's just a different Veil Hallelujah
[2:15:00] the word of the Lord comes to the
[2:15:02] prophet and the prophet comes to the
[2:15:03] people so it's still all
[2:15:09] God come on musicians I'm closing come
[2:15:12] on come on musicians musicians I'm
[2:15:15] closing
[2:15:17] listen I'm going to hit this real quick
[2:15:19] and I'm going to get out of the way
[2:15:22] he said the difference is with the
[2:15:24] fundamental people is they never get the
[2:15:26] Holy
[2:15:28] Ghost right they sit in church they know
[2:15:30] the
[2:15:31] quotes they they reading the books all
[2:15:35] that stuff but it's just
[2:15:39] law it's just dos and don'ts you know
[2:15:42] how you have those people brother murvin
[2:15:45] that sit in church and they can critique
[2:15:47] the
[2:15:49] ministry there say well well the prophet
[2:15:52] said this over here and they'll send you
[2:15:54] quotes and all kind of stuff and won't
[2:15:56] even come to church
[2:15:58] Faithfully
[2:16:02] true I want to tell you what a prophet
[2:16:04] said and you ain't got enough strength
[2:16:06] enough Faith to come sit in the
[2:16:08] sanctuary God know I I gotta work I got
[2:16:11] a job you ain't got enough Faith to ask
[2:16:13] God to bless you with a job where you
[2:16:14] can be in
[2:16:17] service you know people that don't pray
[2:16:19] like that is people that don't want to
[2:16:21] be
[2:16:25] here don't get mad at me blame it on
[2:16:30] him you always tell me and say
[2:16:32] brother be
[2:16:36] yourself and I take that
[2:16:40] literally
[2:16:43] Hallelujah we have too many fundamental
[2:16:45] people sitting in church with truth and
[2:16:47] say they believe but they're not willing
[2:16:50] to give themselves over to the
[2:16:52] vision because remember we go back to
[2:16:55] Rebecca hallelujah what made her the
[2:16:58] chosen one she was able to fulfill the
[2:17:02] vision of
[2:17:04] ela without even talking to
[2:17:09] her never met him before a day in her
[2:17:12] life but she could fulfill the vision
[2:17:14] praise God so that means Hallelujah I
[2:17:17] ain't got to go to Jeffersonville I
[2:17:19] ain't got to go to Sunset Mountain I
[2:17:21] ain't got to go to subo Canyon all I got
[2:17:23] to do is yield myself and tap into the
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:29] vision tap into the vision of the
[2:17:34] Lord am I
[2:17:39] closing Oh
[2:17:42] my he said I find two classes of people
[2:17:44] two churches two
[2:17:47] churches and I'll say this openly to
[2:17:49] brother Barry h Hallelujah right here
[2:17:51] right now if you don't have Pentecostal
[2:17:55] Faith you're another church in this
[2:17:59] church
[2:18:03] true and
[2:18:06] scripturally I hate to say it but I got
[2:18:08] to say it and
[2:18:10] scripturally there was always a church
[2:18:12] in a
[2:18:13] church
[2:18:15] true cuz you had
[2:18:17] Moses and you had the
[2:18:19] moabites right
[2:18:22] they had all the same altars and
[2:18:24] Bullocks and seven Chambers all these
[2:18:27] things hallelujah what they didn't have
[2:18:30] Vindication from
[2:18:33] God so like I said you have all the same
[2:18:35] quotes we got all these things but God
[2:18:38] never has Vindicated your life what is
[2:18:40] that Vindication the Holy
[2:18:43] Spirit until the fire comes on your
[2:18:47] altar your worship hasn't been accepted
[2:18:49] yet amen
[2:18:51] that's
[2:18:53] right
[2:18:58] Hallelujah and we're in such a a crazy
[2:19:01] time where people get upset because you
[2:19:04] preach on getting filled with the holy
[2:19:06] spirit
[2:19:08] amen he he talk about the Holy Ghost too
[2:19:13] much all he do every time he preach he
[2:19:16] preaching about the Holy Ghost I wish he
[2:19:18] tell me something else without the Holy
[2:19:20] Ghost you won't
[2:19:25] understand without the Holy Ghost it's
[2:19:27] just L to
[2:19:29] you but the Holy Ghost brings in the
[2:19:32] nature of God to be able to receive what
[2:19:34] you heard in the right
[2:19:37] channel so you should never get tired of
[2:19:40] hearing about the Holy Ghost because
[2:19:42] what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[2:19:44] your
[2:19:45] reers and I say unto you if you already
[2:19:48] got it you can have another one
[2:19:55] ah that one was a challenge
[2:19:58] huh well let me ask you something how
[2:20:01] many times can a woman have a baby
[2:20:04] yeah she can have birth after birth
[2:20:07] until her body can't handle it anymore
[2:20:10] Hallelujah so what I'm saying to you
[2:20:13] church we can have experience after
[2:20:15] experience after experience rebirth
[2:20:18] after rebirth until God has fulfilled us
[2:20:22] up to what we are to be which is
[2:20:26] perfection so if you got for the whole
[2:20:28] you if you got the holy ghost look for a
[2:20:32] [Applause]
[2:20:38] refilling but the thing is we got too
[2:20:40] many people married to
[2:20:43] God on spiritual birth
[2:20:47] control Lord Lord don't touch me like
[2:20:50] that now I ain't
[2:20:55] ready don't do that I ain't I I don't
[2:20:57] want no more kids don't do
[2:21:00] that
[2:21:02] rebirth birth after birth experience
[2:21:04] after
[2:21:05] experience it don't stop with just that
[2:21:08] one
[2:21:10] time Hallelujah remember remember the
[2:21:13] prophet when he preach and I'm trying to
[2:21:15] close remember the prophet when he
[2:21:17] preached why Christ speak he said I'm a
[2:21:20] preach just because it'll nail us down

[2:22:56] David had Mighty Warriors with
[2:23:00] him but it wasn't the Mighty
[2:23:03] Warriors that help him get away from
[2:23:07] Saul it was
[2:23:13] Jonathan it was his the Bible said they
[2:23:15] were
[2:23:18] close-knit so what Jonathan saw
[2:23:21] he saw himself in
[2:23:24] David if David would have got hurt he
[2:23:27] would have felt the same
[2:23:29] pain and catch this Jonathan loved David
[2:23:34] more than he loved his own father that's
[2:23:39] right and you ought to love God more
[2:23:42] than you love your whole
[2:23:47] life yeah he had Mighty me and all these
[2:23:50] things but when Saul said you know what
[2:23:52] he put out a decree he said hey we going
[2:23:54] to kill David Jonathan went back R to
[2:23:57] David my daddy setting some stuff up man

[2:24:18] just fundamental amen didn't hear the
[2:24:21] Holy Ghost oh yeah we know
[2:24:27] that
[2:24:32] listen one of them is a
[2:24:35] fundamental and the other one is
[2:24:36] Pentecostal the fundamental position you
[2:24:38] know what they are in Christ but they
[2:24:41] haven't got no faith the Pentecost
[2:24:44] received the Holy Ghost listen to this
[2:24:47] now and got plenty of faith but don't
[2:24:51] know who they
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:53] are you ask the question how can you
[2:24:56] have the Holy Ghost and don't know who

[2:25:06] there's a yielding you must
[2:25:10] possess hallelujah it's not all about
[2:25:13] power power power no it's about a
[2:25:15] yielding
[2:25:19] [Music]

[2:25:22] they got plenty of Faith but they don't
[2:25:24] know who they are if I could ever get
[2:25:26] them together like a man got money in

[2:25:31] a check the other one can write the
[2:25:32] check and ain't got no money in the bank
[2:25:34] so if I could ever get them
[2:25:39] together fundamental faith and

[2:25:44] and fundamental people if we could ever
[2:25:46] get a

[2:33:39] on how many believe God is
[2:33:44] here so why are we not giving God our
[2:33:47] all
[2:33:50] if you know God is
[2:33:52] here if we truly believe we're in the
[2:33:55] presence of God am when it comes to
[2:33:58] worshiping you don't do what you
[2:34:00] ordinary would
[2:34:01] do you are
[2:34:05] great if you could see
[2:34:07] [Music]
[2:34:09] him if you could see the angels in this
[2:34:12] room who don't know what Redemption is
[2:34:16] who don't know what it means to worship
[2:34:18] a God that's been good Hallelujah a God
[2:34:21] that can heal Hallelujah a God that can
[2:34:24] take pain away
[2:34:26] Hallelujah Church in this moment we are
[2:34:29] to show the Angels what real Redemption
[2:34:32] is all
[2:34:33] about we are to show the angels that we
[2:34:36] worship because we believe in a god of
[2:34:42] reality come on let's open our voices
[2:34:44] and sing it one more time you are
[2:34:48] great you are
[2:34:51] great you
[2:34:54] do so
[2:34:57] great let's worship him let's worship
[2:35:01] him there's no one else like
[2:35:05] [Music]
[2:35:15] you there no one else like
[2:35:22] [Music]
[2:35:32] my I just certainly appreciate the words
[2:35:35] we heard tonight I I just think it's so
[2:35:37] beautiful because for some people we
[2:35:40] heard brother Cadre Diggs preach and for
[2:35:42] other people we heard from
[2:35:44] God and it's really that simple you know
[2:35:48] the the 10 virgins
[2:35:50] there was only one difference between
[2:35:52] them five of them had enough oil to get
[2:35:56] them through five of them needed more
[2:35:59] oil they had oil they just didn't have
[2:36:01] enough oil if we want to talk about the
[2:36:04] the new birth and the renewing and and
[2:36:07] and getting more there's more available
[2:36:09] with the Deep calls there's a deep to
[2:36:11] respond it certainly is a wonderful
[2:36:14] thing tonight there is so many things I
[2:36:16] I just want to say this brothers and
[2:36:18] sisters it's no AC ENT that we had been
[2:36:20] preaching for a long time on our
[2:36:22] positions and and you know we can talk
[2:36:25] about having the position seated in
[2:36:27] Heavenly places but if we can't be a
[2:36:29] husband to our wife are we seated
[2:36:32] there if we can't be a wife to our
[2:36:35] husband according to the word of
[2:36:38] God we've got our positions here on
[2:36:40] Earth but once we get into those
[2:36:42] positions it's so beautiful we can have
[2:36:44] all the fundamentalism there is but wait
[2:36:47] for that Pentecostal Faith to come on
[2:36:49] the scene and then brothers and sisters
[2:36:51] this is where I believe we're going to
[2:36:53] as a congregation as a body of Believers
[2:36:55] here in Calgary as the Bride of Jesus
[2:36:57] Christ receives this Revelation why cry
[2:37:01] speak the
[2:37:02] word you already know God's will it's
[2:37:05] his word he's not waiting for you to
[2:37:09] call upon him to come and do it he wants
[2:37:11] you to do it he wants me to do it she
[2:37:14] has thus saith the Lord and the mind of
[2:37:17] Christ to know what to do with that word
[2:37:20] word but then he goes further in that
[2:37:22] quote and he says but some people they
[2:37:24] don't have it and when they don't have
[2:37:25] it then they just set
[2:37:26] still and that's the way it should be
[2:37:29] but I want to encourage us I believe we
[2:37:31] heard from Heaven tonight we heard from
[2:37:33] almighty God don't cry brothers and
[2:37:35] sisters speak the word step into that
[2:37:38] vision and allow that Pentecostal Faith
[2:37:41] to come forward in your life my goodness
[2:37:43] I believe I could preach right now his
[2:37:46] spirit is here if you have a need
[2:37:47] tonight he's not in anxious hurry to
[2:37:50] leave the building if you have a need
[2:37:52] he's more than able to deliver it to you
[2:37:55] if you want the Holy Ghost be like that
[2:37:58] brother and say hey I'm not leaving this
[2:38:00] building until I receive that promise
[2:38:03] because it's for me doesn't matter about
[2:38:06] anybody else brother kadre you got me

[2:38:11] word that you gave to us tonight can we

[2:38:22] that a little bit earlier if you're
[2:38:23] walking through a valley and there's

[2:41:42] for speaking to us
[2:41:44] Lord thank you for letting us know Lord
[2:41:47] Jesus that we could become so
[2:41:50] fundamental that we just completely
[2:41:52] ground your power Lord that we
[2:41:56] completely put ourselves in the seat of
[2:41:58] the scornful that we we make ourselves
[2:42:01] just like the the the Sadducees and the
[2:42:04] Pharisees Lord but we know that you came
[2:42:07] Lord Jesus you didn't send an angel you
[2:42:10] came yourself Lord Jesus to shatter the
[2:42:12] traditions of men and father we know
[2:42:15] that many people couldn't receive the
[2:42:18] words that were spoken they were busy
[2:42:20] trying to conform but father you gave
[2:42:23] more than just a law you gave yourself
[2:42:27] you gave your spirit Lord you broke your
[2:42:29] blood cell at Calvary so that you could
[2:42:31] come back upon your people and Lord
[2:42:34] Jesus thousands of years later you came
[2:42:37] again oh Lord and you gave your word you
[2:42:40] put it back in the hand of a prophet to
[2:42:43] deliver to your people and you reminded
[2:42:45] us of that tonight Lord Jesus we thank
[2:42:47] you for that and that was shatter the
[2:42:49] traditions of men once again that they
[2:42:52] would be able to go on from the
[2:42:54] tradition and ritual and get right into
[2:42:56] you father Lord Jesus tonight I pray
[2:42:59] that would be each and every one of ours
[2:43:01] experience here Lord that we would not
[2:43:03] remain fundamental but Lord Jesus that
[2:43:06] we would see your Pentecostal Spirit
[2:43:09] living out through US Lord that we would
[2:43:11] no longer cry but there would be
[2:43:14] something even in the weakest one of us
[2:43:16] Lord to just speak your word and and say
[2:43:19] that's your word daddy oh Father please
[2:43:22] come on the scene and deliver it father
[2:43:25] we just ask that you would keep your
[2:43:26] hand upon each one tonight Lord maybe

[2:43:35] keep your hand upon them Lord that you
[2:43:36] would restore brother kad's strength
[2:43:39] father that you would just continue to
[2:43:41] pour yourself out to him Lord and
[2:43:44] through him to your people as he travels
[2:43:47] and ministers your gospel
[2:43:50] father and Lord Jesus tonight my my
[2:43:53] final word Lord to the body and to
[2:43:56] everyone Lord is that we would go from
[2:43:58] saying Lord Jesus that our testimony is
[2:44:01] that we believe the message of the hour
[2:44:03] Lord to be able to say that we believe
[2:44:05] we are Sons and Daughters of the most
[2:44:08] high God let that be our testimony to
[2:44:10] the world when we meet them Father we
[2:44:13] love you and we thank you we just commit
