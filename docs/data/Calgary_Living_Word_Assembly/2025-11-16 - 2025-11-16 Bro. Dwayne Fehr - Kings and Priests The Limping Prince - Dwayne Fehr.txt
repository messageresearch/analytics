Oh, it's hard [singing and music] to take the first step when I [singing and music] don't know the way. Each step is so [music] uncertain.

Thinking of this this song, I don't think a single one of us probably go hardly a day without thinking about when it's going home time. I think we're we're in that season without a doubt. And my blessed home and high when the redeemed. Each one of you claiming to be the redeemed. Let's just sing it this morning with joy [music] in our hearts. Well, I am [singing] thinking of the rapture [music] in our blessed home on [singing] high when the redee [music] are gathering.

I was thinking of this next song. You know, we're only going to get there. The prophet said after he went past the curtain of time, nothing but perfect love will enter there. That's my desire to have that perfect love. Fill my way, Lord, with your love. &gt;&gt; Well, let me walk.

[music] I know your arms is not too short and you can reach [music] me too. So as I pray and press my way into your [music] kingdom, I'll run to be [music] more like you. I'm reaching out [singing] to you standing. I'm reaching [music] out to you, dear Lord. I'm reaching out to you. I [music] know your [singing] arm is not too short and he can reach [music] me too. So as I pray, press my way into [music] your kingdom. I know like [music] you just by reaching out to you. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Happy to see all of you. Uh we just want to apologize. Uh if you see that we have been moving people around. Uh Sunday is a little bit difficult for us to know who is coming to for us to prepare. So sometimes we have to move you around. If it does happen, forgive us. But we want to make sure that everybody has a place to sit. God bless you. Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, what a beautiful sight, a bouquet that you've prepared this morning. &gt;&gt; Father, your children from all walks of life. Father, this morning coming together with one purpose to come and worship &gt;&gt; the resurrected Jesus this morning. Father, [music] &gt;&gt; we've come with our sacrifice this morning. Our praises to you this morning, Father. Each one with our faith, our measure of faith this morning, Father. And this morning, I know Brother Paul has done his best by the inspiration given to him, Father, to sing songs of Zion. &gt;&gt; This morning, our pastor, brother, couldn't be here this morning. Father, he as brother Dwayne all the way from Edmonton to come and speak to us this morning. Father, this morning as he's preparing to come here, Lord, may you have a place in our hearts to receive the word that is about to come, Lord. And each and everyone that made the effort to come here this morning. Sometimes the pool is so hard for us to get up and come to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this morning, they made it here. Lord, may they not go back empty-handed. Lord, &gt;&gt; may you bless us all together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even those that were able to switch on their their their television, whatever means that they are listening to us on the online, may you bless them as well. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are here and we know that you are here. Feed your children as we come. Father, we thank you. We bless your name. Those that are on the way coming, may you grant them travel mercy. We thank you. We bless your name. those that could not make it here this morning as well for whatever reason. Maybe they are working, maybe they a little bit cold, maybe they are sick, &gt;&gt; may you bless them as well. &gt;&gt; Now we are bringing our tithes and offering. We pray that Lord you receive it and bless it in Jesus name that we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I've got so much to thank you for. Just a thought. I don't know if our pastor has heard this yet, but uh brother Ed Hammermeister I just heard this morning has a really really tough situation. So I just want to hold him before the Lord in prayer. Apparently a stage four cancer pastor of Edmonton uh uh message tabernacle, anti- message tabernacle. So really a difficult trial for him and the congregation there. So just hold Brother Ed Hammermeister in your prayers if you would and the congregation there. Lots of uh lots of trials. was hearing uh the patriarch Abraham this week. Brother Ram talks about this trial that God brings him. He took Abraham's son said come and come and sacrifice your only son. What like what an incredible [music] challenge that was for Abraham, but it was God testing his faith. So these these situations are certainly not easy, but they're to test our faith. And of course, God knows the end from the beginning. So we trust him. He's sovereign. Hold Brother Ed in your in your prayers. Wonderful [music] friend of mine personally. and just had a wonderful relationship over the years. Was really was moved by that news this morning. When I look around and see the things you've done for me, let's let's sing the chorus only. I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see, God has been [singing and music] so good to me when I [music] [music] got to [music] [music] God. So [singing] thank you [music] so much [music] to me. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I got to baby [music] wherever you are. So much to make him [singing and music] for so much. [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There she says. [clears throat] Um, as we're in the spirit of thanking the Lord for what he's for what he's done for me, I I was feeling there to sing this song. It's um it's a wonderful song that I love so much and it speaks to me so dearly. Um, and it just teaches me to be grateful for what the Lord has done in my life. And even through my trials and tribulations, I just want to thank him for what I have. &gt;&gt; And even if um I was expecting something um just by thanking him for even if I don't have it yet, that's just a sign of faith that &gt;&gt; was God and he just by thanking him whether it's sickness, whether it's whether you're going through sickness or whatever it may be, whether whether it's cancer, just thank him for your deliverance from cancer. And I believe God will and I've seen it happen and I believe God will do it for you. &gt;&gt; So, um, sorry for that. While the world looks [music] upon me as I true alone. [music] They say I have nothing but [singing and music] they are so warm in my [singing] heart are rejoicing. [music] How I wish that could sing. [music] Thank you Lord for your blessing. [music] There's a [music] place to stay [singing] on my [music] and you gave me and [music] I find Thank you for your blessings. [music] I know I'm not worthy and these [singing and music] clothes are not you. I don't [singing] have much money, but Lord, I have you [music] and that's all that matters. Though the world may [music] not see, thank [music and singing] you for your blessings on me. There's a roof up above me. I have a good place to see. There's food on my table and shoes [music and singing] on my feet. You gave me your love [music] and a fine family. Thank you Lord for [music] your blessings on me. Cuz roof up above me. I have a good place to sleep. There's food on my door. on my feet that gave me your love and a family. [music] Thank you Lord for your [music] blessings. Thank [music] you for your blessings. [music] Thank [singing] you for your [music] blessings. [applause and music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, my brother. What a wonderful reminder for each one of us this morning. So much to be thankful for this morning. Seems like kind of the theme of the songs this morning. God bless you. Stand with me if you would as we change over the service into the chamber. Let's think two courses and we'll ask our pastor to come introduce uh brother Dwayne this morning. Good to good to have our brother with us and looking forward to what God has in store for us into the chamber. As we know pro the prophet taught us that he's on the outside knocking. We have to open the door. Let's open it to him this morning. That's free moral agency. Let's do that. Let's just say Lord would you come? Would you come and s with me this morning? Dwell into the chamber. [singing] Be free. Holy Spirit, speak to me gently as I close the door. [singing] Heavenly lover, let thy presence cover. Shakina unending is all I long for. [singing] Oh, into the chamber. [singing] Be free, Holy Spirit. or speak [music] to me gently as I close [music] the door. [singing] amly lover. Let thy presence cover your kind of unity [music] is all. [singing] [music] It's the last verse of the song. Jesus is passing this way. Last last verse. He is so tender and loving. He is so near you today. Why don't we invite him this morning? [music] Oh yes. [singing] Open your heart to [music] receive him. Oh, while he is passing this way. Well, think about that this morning. Jesus is passing his way. Oh, Jesus [music] is passing this way. Jesus [music] today. Jesus [music] is passing this way. [music] He is passing this [music] way [singing] to today. Jesus. Oh [music] Jesus is happy. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus is [singing] passing this way. [music] [music] Amen. Sorry, I just needed my notes. God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord one more time. Certainly honored and privileged to gather together this way, &gt;&gt; his only provided place of worship in the age in which we live. &gt;&gt; We're certainly thankful to see everyone here today. We would like to welcome our visitors. Brother uh Yuju Silver, is that right? From Kenya. Did I say that right? Brother, God bless you. Welcome. [applause] I've been to Nairobi a couple of times and [music] uh it's a wonderful place to visit and uh the people are just wonderful. So I trust you feel right at home today. and any other person who is visiting today maybe like the fairs. Brother Dwayne, sister Connie, God bless you. Pretty much like family though. [applause] For anybody that doesn't know, uh, Sister Connie is Sister Shel's sister. So, we used to spend a fair bit of time with Brother Dwayne and Sister Connie while Brother Ken was here. And since he went on to his reward, seems like brother Dwayne and Sister Connie have stepped into another role in their church [music] and have become the pastor of that church, Saskatoon Tabernacle. So, Brother Dwayne doesn't travel as much. That's why we don't see him so much. Now, he's got a flock of sheep that he tends to there. And hopefully, we can see him a little more in the future. But I know what it's like to not travel because your your heart is at home. But uh we just certainly welcome you today. And uh we just also like to remember brother Simple Chessi, our brother. He's been fellowshiing fellowshipping with us for a few months here. And uh he has a job to do. He's about to go back, I think it's to Belgium, is it? He's going to Belgium, I think, in the next couple of days because his wife, Sister Agnes, is there and just about to deliver their baby. I think they're days away from the delivery. Is that right? So, he's going to collect his bride and his baby. [applause] So we just want to remember the Chime messes the family and uh just ask the Lord would bless them abundantly and pray for a safe delivery and then safe arrival of the whole family coming here to visit us. Certainly look forward to that day, brother. You know, uh just a couple of announcements before we get going. I just wanted to remind us we have brother Cadre Digs here next weekend. We also have the funeral next weekend for Sister Germaine. Um the grad celebration is coming up and uh I've mentioned it a few times and I just want to mention it again. We need to get a count for the amount of people that wish to be celebrated for graduating. Anybody who hasn't been appreciated, we certainly want to give you that opportunity. So if you could please reach out to me. We've [music] only had two people reach out and we need to have a minimum number of people to be able to rent the venue. So, we just want to try and and appreciate you. If you're interested, by all means, reach out. If not, we'll uh certainly look for another uh opportunity or venue. Over in December, I'll be traveling to see Brother Darren Ber in uh in December. It'll be the 7th. I'll be there for three services, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Brother Dawn is going to take the service on Sunday. Here we have the youth service on the 12th. We have the youth activity on the 21st. And we have uh the 31st, which is a Wednesday night, will be a communion worship service here on the last day of the year. No place that I think I'd rather be. But &gt;&gt; maybe we could just uh have a word of prayer here this morning and change the order of the service. If you have a need, maybe just defy gravity and raise your hand to him this morning. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, this morning we just are so thankful that we can gather together with you. Lord, we know as we already prayed this morning that you're here in our midst because this meeting has been declared to be in your name. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just take you at your word. We don't want anything more and we don't want anything less. We don't want a hybrid religion, Lord. We just want you in the fullness of your word. So, Father, this morning, we just want to commit each and every need, Lord, that was expressed to you, that was made known unto you by the way of an uplift hand. And father, we pray that you would just bless each one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sovereignly according to their desire. Father, we pray for the friend of the carpenters. Lord, they have a request this morning. We pray that you would just meet that need, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray that you would keep your hand upon upon brother Simple as he travels. Lord, watch over the the baby. Father, we pray for a safe delivery. And Lord, that you would keep mama safe as well, Sister Agnes. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. And father, when your will is, we look forward to seeing the family together here in Calgary. And Lord, we just want to stand united together as a body of believers for our brother in Edmonton. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we know that it's a boasting giant in the valley. And you have given us the grace that we need to, those five smooth stones, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; to be able to stand and defy that boasting giant in the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, that would dare come against one of your servants. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray for the congregation there and we just pray for the the pastor and his family, Lord. Each one, Lord, that needs a touch from you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just stand united with them in your name. Now, Father, as we turn to your word, we just want to commit this service in every aspect into your hands for your glory. Pray that you would just bless Brother Dwayne, Father, that when he would leave here today, that he would have a spring in his step, Lord. That he would have a a song in his soul, Lord Jesus, that he would be able to say he's heard from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, by that we know we will also. We love you, Lord. And we just ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song, reach out and touch the Lord &gt;&gt; as he [music] passes by &gt;&gt; and we'll invite brother Dwayne to just come and take his liberty this morning. Reach out and [music] touch the Lord as he passes by. [music] You'll find he's [singing] not too busy to hear your heart's [singing] cry. He is passing by this moment. Your [music] son and touch the Lord as he [music] goes by. Glory shout and [music] touch the Lord. He passes by. You will find he's not too busy to hear [singing and music] your heart. He is [music and singing] promise your [music] supply. Reach out [singing] and touch the Lord [music] as he goes by. [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like, you know, we sing these little songs and I wonder sometimes if that reality of who's in our midst actually if it becomes a reality to us. &gt;&gt; You know, he promised that where two or three would be gathered, I will &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; be there in their midst. &gt;&gt; I will be there in their midst. you know, I think it was uh you know, little Fanny Crosby, you know, she's born blind and and uh you know, grew up with that kind of a complex &gt;&gt; uh surrounding her. And yet when she was approached about, you know, taking the gift that God gave her and using it for for uh the glory of this world and for money and for whatever it would fame, whatever it might bring her, she said, "I'd never do that. How could I do that? &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, how do you know?" She said, "I'll know him." &gt;&gt; Said, "You're completely blind. How are you going to know him?" She said, "I'll know him by the touch &gt;&gt; of his hand. &gt;&gt; Listen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here now. &gt;&gt; You might have your natural sight, but don't miss the reality &gt;&gt; that he's here. [music] &gt;&gt; That he's here. Turn around. Shake somebody's hand. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Wish him God's blessing. God bless you. Certainly. God bless you, brother Mvin. Buddy, God bless you, sis. God bless you. I might as well just go right across the platform, huh? God bless you all. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I want to say thank you to the musicians. Wish you God's blessing. I'll let you have your seats. I want to say a big thank you to Brother Barry uh for the invitation. Once again, I uh uh you know, understand from a from a pastor standpoint that it's uh you know, you you guard your pulpit. You don't just give it out to anybody. And so I I certainly do um I count it an honor to to stand here again. It's brother Barry and I were just talking in the office. He said, "How long's it been?" I said, "I don't know." I was trying to remember that yesterday and I really don't know. There there was a little while ago I was in the city and and is it okay if I just get rid of this? You know what? That doesn't mean you change things out there, though. I I tell my mom and dad, you know, I'm born white and uh but I tell them all the time that they they were out of the will of God when they had me in Canada cuz I should have been born where it was hot and I so I'm not complaining at home. I hardly ever take my jacket off. So, I'm just going to you just take it for what it is. But anyhow, um you know, we're up I don't know when it was months ago now, but we were here. I had a little fellowship with brother Barry and he asked if I'd take the service. I said, "Ah, I don't know. And right then uh or just shortly thereafter, I got a a phone call and I had to go back home and I needed to be there the following day. So I'm just like, "Brother Barry, I can't. I got to go home." And I didn't even tell them why. I just told him I couldn't. And and uh anyhow, [clears throat] it is good. I just say this. It's good. It's good to be back in Calgary again. &gt;&gt; I look at all these young men. Good grief. &gt;&gt; My goodness. These were just uh you know they were just boys. I remember their graduations some of them and and now they're men and man I don't know how much hair that man can grow on his face but you know just one thing about it we're getting old and brother Barry asked me this morning he said hey boy I was wondering if you were going to make it or not. when are you coming? And what I didn't tell him is it takes me too long to do my hair now. And [clears throat] this is not so true. You know, you just you you realize that this mortal life uh it's just a vapor and and you know how Paul would say I was I was once young and now I'm old and uh you know sometimes we we don't want to accept the reality that we are getting old. You know, brother Ram says every, you know, everybody wants to hold on to that their youth and and why? Because there is a an eternal man on the inside that doesn't get old. That's right. &gt;&gt; And yet he fights with this vessel, you know, and and uh things just change. And pretty soon you find out I blink and now I'm a grandpa of eight and and how did that happen? And you know, it just doesn't in my mind it doesn't compute. It doesn't compute. But I know here I have no continuing city. &gt;&gt; I have no continuing city. And I have just I feel like Abraham. I've been seeking for one all my life. [snorts] Uh I say this, I found the one that satisfies. I'm just waiting for the reality to step out of this dimension into that dimension. And I won't it be a time. You know, we got a we got a sister back home. She goes over to Brother Kelly's church and she sings a little song. Uh won't it be a time? You know, won't it be a time? And I I that's just the reality. I'm looking for the time when uh mortal life is no longer known. It doesn't exist anymore. We just uh I can come and you know if I if I'm living in my little place back there in Saskatchewan and I think, man, I want to see Brother Barry. I'm going to see Brother Barry. Man, I want to fellowship with Brother Paul. I'm gonna It's going to be like that. I won't even have hardly time to blink my eyes. And &gt;&gt; you know, it's no wonder we're going to need an eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh even just to even just to sit down and shake hands and talk about the good things of God and what God has how did we get here? &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that he has started a work in our lives that only he can finish. &gt;&gt; So I want to say Lord be it unto me according to your will. &gt;&gt; You know I I heard the prayer this morning. Sometimes, you know, our way gets dark and and it gets rough and and you don't think you can go another mile, but it's all part of the molding process that God's got for what lays just beyond the veil. So, uh, Lord, help us that we might, you know, let's not let's not look at our troubles and our struggles as God trying to destroy our lives, but rather let's look at them as God, you know, I [clears throat] excuse me, Brother Barry, it's your fault already. He said, Lord, Lord, take him off his notes. And I haven't even I haven't even read my notes. But, you know, I I we're we bought this old house back uh in Saskatchewan here this last year and I got we we got to uh you know, it's an old home. So, Brother Paul, I don't even want to talk about these things because I'm I'm I'm talking to experts and and and they build like palaces and I I got a shack and and uh but you know, we we decided we were going to make it our own. When we bought it, we looked at it, we're like, "Well, yeah, the floor plan, the house is the location is everything. The house is not much, but we can make the house what we would. It would be it would be good enough for us, you know. I I don't need a mansion here. I'm being honest. I don't even need one when I get over there. I just that's not part of my my makeup. I it it I'm happy with whatever. And uh but in the in in in the vision of what I had uh what come to what I wanted for the home. Uh, you know, when you have a vision for something, if it's not already built according to those plans, you've got a lot of work to do. &gt;&gt; And you brothers that do renovations understand what I'm talking about. They take and and I believe this is just a shadow of what God is doing with our lives. You know, I bought this old house and and uh, you know, I looked at the walls and I think, yeah, that wall's got to come out. That's got to be opened up. This has got to be moved. This has got, you know, it's just like I don't even know how to do any of this except hold a big hammer and I can do that. And and [clears throat] um And I got to I got to into the house and and my initial what I thought was going to be no big deal. You just grab a hammer and you start removing things. I come to find out that there wasn't just giprock on the wall because giprock is easy to destroy with a hammer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I got thinking about God's ways in our lives. You know when God wants to do something with our lives &gt;&gt; sometimes he's got to take what we have spent 20 years 30 years 50 years 70 years well we have our vision for our own life has to become subject to the vision he has &gt;&gt; for our lives &gt;&gt; and so when we say Lord here I am take me &gt;&gt; uh lord we don't you don't you don't really understand what you're saying when you say lord I surrender all because sometimes the great contractor, God's going to come and sell me, hey, yeah, the you know what, the foundation is there, but that is not what I had in mind. &gt;&gt; So, and I realized very quickly and you know, uh, in the when it came to destroying the walls of the house, I picked up the big hammer and what I thought was just a giprock wall and it would, you know, just a couple swings would just take care of that. Uh, I come to find out that there wasn't just gip rock on the wall, but I would have to peel all the giprock off the wall. I'll tell you, you think, well, that's no big deal, Brother Dwayne. You know, giprock is screwed to the wall. And so you might think, well, it's not a big deal. It comes off. But it doesn't come off as easy as we think. &gt;&gt; It takes an effort to get it off the wall. And there's a lot of screws that are left there when they're Listen, I'm going to bring this down to our lives right now. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of screws that are left there. There's scars that are left there. When God takes and pulls off some of the the the facade, &gt;&gt; the coverings of our life, we've got these things that it's all held together so nicely because we want everybody to think and look at us and perceive us a certain way. And God said, "But that's not what I want from you. That's not the vision I have for you." And God begins to take and and as a contractor he begins to pull the gip rock off only to find out and you're thinking you start pulling the rock off the wall and it's and it holds on and it holds on and finally it finally you know and it comes off [snorts] in pieces and then and then it just takes longer. It's harder and you're thinking every time God takes something off he's trying to take something out of your life to replace it with something better. &gt;&gt; It's like oh Lord oh Lord I don't know how much more I can handle. We finally get the giprock off the wall to find out there's paneling behind the giprock and it is also screwed to the wall. And so the great contractor has to go and now he's got to take the paneling and it should just come off the wall. But you know what? It's not just paneling on the wall. Now there's plywood behind the paneling that's on the wall and I need to get behind the plywood to know what I &gt;&gt; Do you understand, church? We got layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of of of issues of h of of your mother and father's problems, of your grandparents' problems. We got layer upon layer. And when the and when the great contractor looks at the life and says, "But my vision for that life looks like this &gt;&gt; and I've got to get all the layers off." And sometimes in the removing of the layers, God, we we say, "Oh, God, I I can't handle anymore. or I can't take anymore. And he's like, I know you don't think you can, but when I'm done, just like remember brother um Gary Walker, how many remember how many knows brother Gary Walker here? Remember his testimony &gt;&gt; when God told him, he said, "But if you would have if you would know what I'm going to do with your life, you would have signed up for this." &gt;&gt; And it nearly it not nearly killed him. It killed him three times. &gt;&gt; And to this day, he walks with a limp. He drags himself around. And that's sometimes what God has to do with our lives. You you might have a vision. You might have what you your dream for your life, but the moment that you say, "Lord, here I am. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm in your hands." &gt;&gt; You don't know what father's going to do with your life. &gt;&gt; And he might have to take it right apart &gt;&gt; to rebuild it &gt;&gt; into his own image. &gt;&gt; Into his own image. &gt;&gt; Have you got your Bibles with you this morning? &gt;&gt; Lord, would you give me some grace this morning? because I'm going to need it. [clears throat and cough] Revelations chapter 1, if you have your Bible, I was asking the Lord, Lord, what you know, you know, there's lots to thank you for standing. Honor to the reading of the word. There's, you know, there's a whole book uh to preach out of, but Lord, what what would you have for this morning? &gt;&gt; What would you have for this morning? And &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter one should [clears throat] be easy enough for us all to find. And I want to start reading at verse one. says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified by his angel unto his servant John, who bear record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand. John to the verse four John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace and peace be unto you. Uh from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne. from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood &gt;&gt; and hath made us &gt;&gt; kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we've read your word and we ask now, Lord, that you would come, Lord, that you would break the bread of life, that your children could go home satisfied today in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. I want to take my thought of this morning out of uh out of verse um oh, I want to take it out of verse six, but let me back up to verse five just to get started. It says, "And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead." And this, you know, I I don't have much education. And so sometimes when I read, uh, I'll be I'll be the first to say things, the wording of the scripture sometimes stumbles me. I it makes me really think, what am I reading? What what what Lord, what are you trying to say right now? But I want you just to read this verse. It says, "And the prince," remember who he's speaking of, "and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth, and the prince of the kings &gt;&gt; of the earth." Now, I I'm just speak from my ignorance this morning. uh you know in in in my mind's eye and the way I've always been taught is that a king is sovereignly he reigns sovereignly. &gt;&gt; His son is the prince. &gt;&gt; His son is the prince. But the wording is that the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. &gt;&gt; Wow. and a prince of the kings of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when we begin to look at that word prince and I I I actually went to the Greek and I begin to study this. I begin to look at it and I think Lord, what something is I know you've got something wonderful here. What is it? &gt;&gt; And that word prince actually is a Greek word by the name of Arong. And I'm probably saying it all wrong, but [clears throat] I I want you to I want you to understand the meaning of it first. And it actually it the meaning of it is it holds the highest and most exalted position. So it begins to bring a little light on what the word is actually saying. the prince of the kings of the earth. The highest and most exalted position of the kings of the earth. &gt;&gt; All right. Now this the next verse is uh and he has made us kings &gt;&gt; and priests. &gt;&gt; And he hath made us kings and priests. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's a lot of uh there's a lot of kings, you know, in the world we live in. We have prime ministers. The United States has presidents. Some of the countries have presidents, but a lot of the world still have kings. &gt;&gt; And a king is a man. He's a it's a position of authority, of supreme authority in that country. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't believe for a minute that the scripture was talking about those kings. &gt;&gt; I don't believe for a minute that it was talking about the kings of the world as far as the nominal world is concerned. But I do believe that he was speaking about the kings. He has made us kings and priests &gt;&gt; and he is the most exalted &gt;&gt; amongst the kings and the priests. &gt;&gt; The kings and the priests. &gt;&gt; So let me let me just go on a little bit. I want to uh I I want to take that thought of kings and priests and uh if the Lord would give me a little bit of grace this morning to to to to speak on that thought. you you would realize in the Old Testament, those of you that that study the word and and that have been taught in the word, and I know you've been well taught here, so I don't have to I don't have to stutter too much when I'm speaking. Uh you've been well taught. Uh you realize that in the Old Testament, you know, you could be a king or a priest, &gt;&gt; but you could not be a king &gt;&gt; and a priest, &gt;&gt; right? They were two separate uh uh they were two separate offices before God in the economy of God. You could be one or you could be the other, but you could not be both. &gt;&gt; It was just something that that that you remember Uzziah. You remember Uzziah the king? I'm just going to set just a little background. Uzziah the king this morning. He uh uh you know he had walked into the temple that day and and he had God had exalted him in his position to to such a place that he actually uh his own pride overtook him. &gt;&gt; His own pride overtook him. And God God be merciful to us as human in our humanity that whatever he whatever position he places you in that we never think more of ourselves uh than what we truly are is just sinners saved by grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just s I was I I was visiting with a man the other day and he's not a he's not a Christian man. I was introduced to him by somebody and and uh and uh they introduced me as a pastor and he kind of looked at me funny. I said, "Well, don't stumble on that word." I said, "All it means is that I am the servant to everybody that's in my congregation." Sorry, brother Barry. Hate to bring you down to where we're at, but isn't that what isn't that the truth? You know, we're not way up here, even though God has placed us in a position, but we're actually here to serve. &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, Uzziah [clears throat] was a king and he got he got to a place where he got so lifted up in his position that he actually felt like he could go into the temple and take the place of a priest. Why? Because he was a godly man. Uzziah [snorts] was a godly man. Uh uh you know, um Isaiah had such a high regard for him because of his godliness. as a young man. And so the time come when Uzziah decided that, you know what, I I can if if the priests aren't going to do this, I can do this myself. And in the moment that he made that decision and stepped into that vision, that part of life, God instantly smokeed him. &gt;&gt; He died instantly. Why? Because you could be a king &gt;&gt; or a priest, but you could not be a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It was against what the laws of God were. You take Saul, a a great man. Uh and you know, he was a king himself. He was well-loved. He was uh uh you know, he he he had a I want to say he had a great ministry. But the day that he disobeyed and went to make the sacrifice himself &gt;&gt; immediately. &gt;&gt; Immediately. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I We can't We can't wait for the prophet to get here. We need this now. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; we can't wait for the preacher to show up. We need to do this now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isn't patience, no wonder God holds patience as such a high virtue? &gt;&gt; Because we live in a now world and everything has to happen on our time. But if we could just relax and let things happen in God's time, you find out life goes a lot better. &gt;&gt; You find out life goes a lot better. So, so, so, um, just let me get back to my my thought this morning. So, you can you you understand that you can be a king or a priest, but you can't be both in the Old Testament. And yet we would find Abraham after he went to battle for his uh you know for his nephew Lot and and won this great warfare. The Bible says that he actually broke bread with Melzdc &gt;&gt; who was a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the world in in the religious world they're still questioning who's Melzdc. But for those who have sat under the opening of the word in this age, you and I are very aware who Melzdc was. Melzdc, we've been taught that Melzdc actually was Jesus &gt;&gt; before he became Jesus. &gt;&gt; So So this is not we that the reality of Melzdc just being a a a normal flesh and blood man doesn't even exist. &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. Abraham actually broke bread with the King of Kings, &gt;&gt; with the Lord of Lords. Abraham actually broke bread and was blessed. &gt;&gt; But Melchzdc was a different entity. He wasn't just a natural man &gt;&gt; born of a woman. He wasn't just a natural king or a natural priest. &gt;&gt; But he was the one that held the office from a spiritual standpoint of both king and priest. &gt;&gt; Understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand? All right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm gonna I'm trying to save time this morning, so I feel like I'm rushing and I don't That's good, brother. Relax. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's like we just get into, you know, at home we have we have uh we have a mixed culture at home, too. We have black people. We have uh we have the uh Mexican people and we have the North American Indian people. And and we tease them all the time and they don't take they don't have no problem with it. They just say, "Hey, I'm on Indian time right now." I'm like, "That's real hard on us white people because we like to be like punctual." And they're like, "Yeah, I know. But when we get there, we'll get there." And I wish I could be like that. Wouldn't take a lot of pressure off. Brother Paul, don't you wish all of the people that wanted you to do Renos were like that? It's okay. Whenever you get here, it'll be all right. But you understand Jesus when we understand scripturally that Jesus Go to the book of Hebrews for one minute. Hebrews chapter 7. Brothers, if you could just pull it up for one minute because we're talking about that you can't be a king. That you couldn't be a king or a a king and a priest. You had to be either or in the Old Testament. Yes. I yet I just read scripture to you out of the book of Revelations where the Bible says, "He hath made us &gt;&gt; kings and priests." &gt;&gt; So Lord, how do you how does this happen? If you couldn't be that in the Old Testament, how does this happen now? And so we jump over to the book of Hebrews and we get into Hebrews chapter 7 and it says this starting at verse 14. It says, "For it's evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning the priesthood. And it is yet far more evident that after the similitude of Melzdc, &gt;&gt; there arose another priest." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I love this. who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life. &gt;&gt; There arose another priest and he hath made us &gt;&gt; kings &gt;&gt; and priests. &gt;&gt; Listen, you are not a priest a priesthood after the order of the ironic priesthood. &gt;&gt; But we have come in an order of the Melzdc priesthood. And if he had, the Bible says this, "And it was made not after the law of carnal commandment." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, we're not here, we're not here uh preaching legalism, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're not here preaching legalism that you got to do this and you got to do that and you got to do this or you're not. No, no. We're preaching life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you ever get the the the the the nature change on the inside, you don't have to be told that my, you know, I don't cut my hair and I don't wear lipstick and I don't wear earrings. I don't go to the bar and I don't watch it. You don't because there's a life, an endless life on the inside that's already tap. It's tapping you on the shoulder and saying, "Hey son, that's not wrong. Hey daughter, that's not becoming to my children." And you and and you are conforming. You're reforming into the image of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the scripture says he's made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life. &gt;&gt; For he testifies that thou art a priest forever &gt;&gt; after the order of Melzdc. &gt;&gt; So we know Jesus absolutely has got the title of a of the of the priest &gt;&gt; of the priest. Not just a priest but the priest. But you jump over to Revelations 19 and he comes running uh you know he comes riding out of the heavens and on his thigh is written a name and what is it? &gt;&gt; King of kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; King of kings. And he hath made us &gt;&gt; kings. And isn't this wonderful church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen although we are the very part of the essence of his being he is still the head. He still stands alone as the redeemer. He still stands as as God the creator. And we are still part of his body. But we are just not we're not just him, &gt;&gt; but we're part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. [clears throat] He hath made us. Let me just stop on this a little bit because I I I I just get excited when I think of these things. And And you you got you you've been going through the church ages, I'm sure. I heard a couple years ago you were. I don't know where you're at right now, Brother Barry, but but I know you were then, so this is probably still familiar to us. Brother Brown says this. He says, he takes that one little phrase, he has made us. &gt;&gt; And he makes this statement. He said, "Oh, there are certain truths that we need to emphasize." &gt;&gt; Now, I take that personally as as a part of the ministry, as a pastor. There are certain truths that we need to emphasize, and this is one of them. &gt;&gt; This is one of them. He hath made us. &gt;&gt; He Come on, church. Who has made us? &gt;&gt; Are you here on your own on your own uh uh uncction on your own reality this morning? Are you here because uh you know just because your mom and dad brought you in? No. No. He &gt;&gt; He hath made us. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we can just keep him as God. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. He has made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me do this for a minute. [clears throat] He said salvation is his doing. Salvation is of the Lord. All of grace, he's redeemed us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He bought us for [clears throat] a purpose. &gt;&gt; We are &gt;&gt; kings. &gt;&gt; Can we say that together this morning? &gt;&gt; We are kings. &gt;&gt; Spiritual kings. &gt;&gt; You see, we we we want this. We want just the title of a king. We want the we want the accolades of the king. We want we want the respect of the king. We we want to walk like that. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says, "Hey, you will be kings over there." Yes, we will be kings there. But here's the reality. We are already kings. &gt;&gt; We are reigning already in a different kingdom. &gt;&gt; Not one that is touched by by hands. Not one that is uh uh not one that is uh um you know that you can that you can actually look at or not one that people bow to you. But we are right now reigning as kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As kings. And brother Brandham says this. He says we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over church. If there's one thing that needs to be emphasized today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is that thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, you are already a king &gt;&gt; and you are already reigning. You say, "Brother Dwayne, I don't feel like I'm reigning." But you're already reigning &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; And the only person that's not recognizing that right now is you. &gt;&gt; Because all hell recognizes your position. &gt;&gt; And when you take your position, they've got to back down. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are the you you are the king. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's reigning. Listen. He says, "For by one man's offense death reigned, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life." Shall reign where? In life. &gt;&gt; Shall do what? Shall reign in life. &gt;&gt; That mean church, that means you have an authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not just a servant &gt;&gt; to the to this world. We're we're a servant to the kingdom, but we are not servant to this world. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Listen, if we Who's of a higher order, you or a dog? &gt;&gt; Who's of higher order? You or or a horse? &gt;&gt; You or an eagle? &gt;&gt; Who's of higher order? &gt;&gt; You were created. The Bible says we were created in the very image &gt;&gt; of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and because of the fall, we lost the reality of the of this one thing that now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; We lost the reality of that. And the opening of the word has come back to bring us back into our position. &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan, Lucifer walked right there in the garden &gt;&gt; with Adam, &gt;&gt; with Eve. &gt;&gt; He was present in the garden with him. And do you think Adam was afraid? Not one moment. &gt;&gt; Do you think Adam feared what? All of Satan's powers. Not even for a moment. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Adam was created in the image of God. &gt;&gt; Adam [screaming] was created in the image of God. &gt;&gt; We sing those little songs, "What have I to dread? What have I to fear? I'm leaning on the everlasting arm." Listen, you're not just leaning on his arm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're part of his very DNA. &gt;&gt; You're part of the almighty God. And Satan knows it and he trembles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've got to step into that position that I am a son of God. I was put here to reign over &gt;&gt; this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother say right now we reign with Christ having dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Right now we reign. That means rulership &gt;&gt; with Christ having dominion over &gt;&gt; Come on, church, say it with me. &gt;&gt; Sin. You know why I'm why? You know why I'm trying to get this to you this morning? You know why I'm asking you to repeat this? I want you to walk out of this building. I want you to put your head on the pillow and I want these words to come back to you that I am a son of God. I was placed as good. He made me a king and I can rule over sin. &gt;&gt; I am here to rule. Listen, we're not here to be to be uh uh uh run down and trotten over and manipulated and and and and and and you know, and chained by the sins of the world. You're here to reign over them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to rule, having dominion over sin. Over the world. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Over the world. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Dwayne, my I got weaknesses." Listen, you have got what it takes on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Why don't you call the great fighter to to, you know, instead of leaving them back in the corner somewhere, &gt;&gt; you know, this is this is a hockey this is a hockey community. This is, you know, this this little Calgary is all about hockey. And I was all about hockey when I was a kid. You know what one of the uh one of the uh the the the the strategy, if I could say, of some of the coaches is in the hockey teams is that you know, you've got a superstar and and and you need to make a goal. So you put the superstar on the ice, you know what they do when the superstar gets on the ice? If he makes one goal or two, guess what? They got these guys that sit on the bench that are these great big huge guys. They can't hardly play hockey for a lick. But if they could hit you, if they can take you out, if they can somehow uh immobilize you, if they can just get you out of the game, &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; they'll win. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's how we treat our God sometimes. &gt;&gt; The champion is sitting in the corner of our lives. And just like the disciples on the boat that day when the ship is rocking and reeling and the waves are coming overboard and they think they're going to drown and it's not till that moment until they've done all they can do. They've cried all they can cried and then in one moment they realize oh Jesus is in the boat. &gt;&gt; It's time to call him up. &gt;&gt; It's time Listen, we're we're in Lady Aia. This is the greatest warfare ever. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; It's time to call him up. &gt;&gt; He's not somewhere's out in the eternities, church. If if you've been birthed again by the seed of God, he is right on the inside of you waiting to come, waiting to be called up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right now, we reign with Christ having dominion over sin. The world, &gt;&gt; what does it say? &gt;&gt; The what? &gt;&gt; The what? You mean I have do I can have dominion over my flesh? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we let our flesh take control of us over and over and over and over. Let me just give you I'm I I'm pretty relaxed. You know, I I come from I come from a place where there's lots of road and there's long distances and there's not a lot of people and I love it that way. So, so, so when you get into a big city and there's cars going this way and that way and everybody's doing this and you know I don't get too excited, but I have a wife that she doesn't she's a little more anxious than I am. And I know some of you all somebody cut you off, man. It don't take long and you in the flesh. But my Bible says that he has dominion &gt;&gt; over my flesh. &gt;&gt; And about the time that rises up, &gt;&gt; something else says, "But what for?" &gt;&gt; What? So you can make it home one minute and 30 seconds faster. [screaming] Whoa. &gt;&gt; And what you don't know is that there's an accident waiting for you three blocks up the road &gt;&gt; and the angel of God just put somebody right in front of your way and now you're all upset about it. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just learn to relax? &gt;&gt; Just let God have his way. So what if I don't get home? &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has given us dominion over sin, &gt;&gt; over the world, &gt;&gt; over the flesh, &gt;&gt; and let's get this one for sure this morning, &gt;&gt; and over &gt;&gt; my brother. &gt;&gt; And over my wife &gt;&gt; or my husband. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; And over &gt;&gt; the devil. Yes. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the ruler, &gt;&gt; the one who is ruling &gt;&gt; this world right now. &gt;&gt; God's given you as a king dominion &gt;&gt; over him &gt;&gt; in my name. They'll cast out &gt;&gt; devils. &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes we just take that so lightly. I'll tell you what, I was [clears throat] telling somebody the other day, there's, you know, there's a many a time I go before I go to the pulpit. Listen, you think Satan stopped at the door when you walked in? &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, he didn't. &gt;&gt; He come right in and sit down right beside you. &gt;&gt; And some of you all are thinking about what you got to do tomorrow. He's been chirping in your ear. Some of you are thinking about about the nasty fight you just had with your husband or your wife before you got here. And oh, how can this ever be? and what am I going to blah blah and and you're worried about your f listen comes right in. &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day I said there's hardly a time anymore but when I go to the pulpit where I get down before the Lord in my office and I take the liberty that God has given me and cast those spirits out so the children of God can have what they need in the morning. &gt;&gt; Listen, God has given us dominion. That means when we say he's got to go, he has got to go. &gt;&gt; Does it mean he's going to stay gone? Oh no. Walk out the door and he'll be right back. &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to tell him where he can go. &gt;&gt; Listen. Either you open the door and let him in or you close the door. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil. He will flee. &gt;&gt; He will flee. You got a temptation that you can't overcome. Resist the devil. &gt;&gt; He will flee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ephesians chapter 6 says, uh, let me, you go, you all know what it says. You know, I I'll be way too long if I start reading scriptures this morning, but you understand that we're not wrestling with with with with natural things, but we're wrestling with principalities and powers and rulers of uh, you know, rulers of the darkness and and what are they here to do? They're here to destroy you. &gt;&gt; They're here to destroy your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Cast down &gt;&gt; imagination." Remember, you're a king. That puts you in rulership in authority. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to have authority over you. I'm here to have authority over Satan and all of his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Which this flesh happens to be part of, it's going to die one day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cast down imaginations. Every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, &gt;&gt; bringing into captivity every thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. every thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; He has made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; What is a king and a priest? You're part of a royal lineage this morning. &gt;&gt; I I I want you to say that. I want you to see that this morning. You're part of a The scripture has placed us. The anointing of this age has come to place us in a position where you recognize like Caleb did that day. Caleb 85 years old, I believe he was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, he'd already spent years helping his brothers uh uh uh uh settle in their land. And here he comes up comes back to Joshua to remind Joshua of a promise that was given him before they ever went over. &gt;&gt; I want my land. Which land was it? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's where the Anakin the uh the the Anakans are. I think that's the right word. &gt;&gt; The biggest of all the giants. &gt;&gt; Caleb wasn't looking at his age. He was looking at a promise. &gt;&gt; He's like, "That is my land, and if I need to go and fight him, I'm more than able." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not our flesh that we're considering. We're considering the God who is now dwelling in our flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me go back to my thoughts this morning. He's made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; You know, I was I I I got to looking at this and I got to remembering uh uh one of um of Saul's children &gt;&gt; in the Bible. How many remembers Mphibicheth or Jonathan? Not Saul. It's Jonathan. That's grandchild to Saul. Saul. That was Jonathan's child. &gt;&gt; Remember David and Saul were such David and Jonathan were such good friends. And you remember when uh you know all the all the chaos that was in Saul's home and and and David, you know, they got to that place where David had to run. &gt;&gt; He remember he got his bow and his arrow and said, "Hey, listen, Jonathan, you tell me if everything is okay. You know, you you just hey, it's beyond the wall or no, it's over here. I'll know I can come back or I know I better run." &gt;&gt; But before they before they finished that agreement, they made an agreement between each other as friends. said, "Listen, we've been boozing friends for years now. If I've got to go, I want I want us to remain friends. &gt;&gt; And your family will remain my friend." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember, they made this agreement. That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, if we just jump forward a little bit, we understand that that when the the last battle was going on and Saul had been killed and and now the the enemy was coming in and some of uh Saul's wives and some of the the the women that were involved there, one of them picked up Mphibicheth, which was just Jonathan's little boy, just a little fell at the time. They picked him up and they begin to run. They were running for safety. And in their in their in their exit, they dropped &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth. remember the story. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to stop right there. They dropped Mphibicheth. Now, let's just back up a minute. Who was his grandfather? &gt;&gt; Saul. Was Saul a king? &gt;&gt; He was a king. &gt;&gt; So, without God coming, and we know God was changing the picture. &gt;&gt; But if God not changed the picture, who would have been the next king? Jonathan, &gt;&gt; it follows the lineage. &gt;&gt; Who would have become the next king? &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; But now we've got a change in the in the order of God's plans. And we find out Mphibicheth should have been king. &gt;&gt; He was in the lineage, but he was dropped. &gt;&gt; I want us just to get this. He was dropped and his life changed instantly &gt;&gt; to one of brokenness, &gt;&gt; sorrow, hardship. &gt;&gt; You understand? He was he would he would have been king, &gt;&gt; but his life changed instantly. I want to I want to I want to jump over to 2 Samuel chapter nine while I'm while I'm on this. says, "And David said, 2 Samuel 9 starting at 1 says, and David said, is there anything left of the house of Saul that I might show kindness for Jonathan's sake, and there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba. And they called him unto David the king, and said unto him, "Art thou Zeba?" And he said, "Thy servant is he?" And the king said, "Is there not yet any of the house of Saul that I may show kindness of God unto him?" And Zeba said unto the king, Jonathan yet has a son which is lame on his feet. And the king said, "Where is he?" And Zeba said unto him, "Behold, he's in the house of Makir, the son of Am in Lobbar." Now, that maybe word doesn't mean anything to you, but if you just go and look up the actual meaning of it, it actually means a ghetto. &gt;&gt; A ghetto. The name means nothing. No thing. No place, no pasture, no nothing. Here is the son of a king living in this condition, broken. His his his walk is lame. He there's nothing. He He radiates nothing of royalty. I thought, God, that's me. I came to this world just like that. &gt;&gt; The son of a king. Yet my life was broken. I had nothing to offer. I was nothing. Nowhere's going nowhere except you reached down your hand for me. &gt;&gt; Here's the King David. And he's asking, "Is there anybody? Is there anybody left that I could show kindness to?" Oh, I'm so thankful that he showed kindness to me this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize you could be a king in that day. Something interesting. I just came studying this. You could be a king and you could still be lame. &gt;&gt; But you know, you could not be a priest and be lame. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, just a second. The scripture says he's made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; You could be a king and be lame, but you couldn't be a priest and be lame. That would pretty much take care of all of our lives, wouldn't it? Right? &gt;&gt; That would take care of all of our lives. You &gt;&gt; know, sometimes we we look at Mphibicheth and we see that God had something for him and we look at his life and how it seemed like it was so destroyed. But I'm here to say that God never forgets. Amen. &gt;&gt; It looked like his life had been so destroyed and for years he had lived like a popper in a ghetto and nothing and nobody no nothing to look forward to in his life. And yet God had never forgot about him. &gt;&gt; God had never overlooked him. And many times we've, you know, in our the way we come to this world, we come in our the our families and you know things happen in our lives that that create circumstances that we also Our walk becomes a disaster. &gt;&gt; Our lives become broken. There's really nothing that's left of us. And somehow somewhere's in the mercy of God, he reaches his hand down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He He knows where you're at. Maybe you're right there this morning. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can look at uh maybe the complexes of your life. Maybe things have happened in your life, in your in your marriage, in your childhood, and how I've witnessed this as a pastor. things that happened in people's childhoods and bring them forward 25 years and they relive them. They're going through them like it just happened right now. And the torment and the pressure of it is so great it just breaks them all apart. &gt;&gt; But God knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; You might think the pastor forgot you. You might think the deacons have forgot you. You might think your family has forgot you. But God knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; And he knows how to bring to your to to somebody's remembrance. He knows how to reach you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your walk, your your hindered walk can only go so far before God says that's enough. &gt;&gt; That's enough. &gt;&gt; I speak about you couldn't be a lame priest. And I'm going to just turn over scripturally. If you're Is this okay this morning? &gt;&gt; Can I have a a little bit longer? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might not have me back for five more years. So, &gt;&gt; Leviticus chapter 21. I want you to go to Leviticus. I want to I want to set the stage here because you scripturally you could not be if you were lame you could not be a priest. &gt;&gt; But he tells us he's made us kings and priests &gt;&gt; and you can look in the mirror. I'm not talking of God's word. I'm talking in the mirror of your bathroom and you can see all of your brokenness, all of your weakness, all of your lameness and then say, "How can God how God? How can you?" &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Satan wants from you. But there is another mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's another mirror that does not reflect all of our brokenness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Leviticus chapter 21, if you got it, brothers, starting at verse 16. I'm just going to bring in this lame priest portion. Says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron. speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generation that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. Oh my, oh my. For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach, a blind man, &gt;&gt; or a lame, or he that has a flat nose, or anything superfluous, or a man that is broken footed, brokenhanded, crooked back, a dwarf, he that has a blemish in his eyes, or be scurvy or scabbed, stones broken. No man, he that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron, the priest shall come nigh. Did I read that right? No man that hath the blemish of the seed of Aaron, the priest shall come nigh to the off to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire. He hath a blemish. He shall not come nigh to offer his bread, offer the bread of his God. &gt;&gt; That don't leave us in a very good position from a natural perspective, does it? &gt;&gt; There would be pretty few &gt;&gt; kings and priests &gt;&gt; if it was if we were still living by the law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he sees me &gt;&gt; through a different mirror. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the blood this morning? &gt;&gt; Bible says, listen, I'm going to go back to reading the scriptures. And he has made us. Not scriptures, brother. I'm speaking again. He has made us. He has made us. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How can we the clay declare to the potter, why have you made me thus? Why have you made me this way? &gt;&gt; Don't you understand this morning, church, &gt;&gt; that the Bible says, "But we are fearfully, wonderfully made." &gt;&gt; That means that you are. So, I'm going to use Can I use you this morning, brother? Would you stand to your feet? All right. You, brother, stand to your feet. Brother Ameilian, I want you to stand to your feet. And I want some Give me somebody who's short. Where's that brother that prayed? He's not very big. Where is he at? Hold on. I I mean in I mean stature-wise right there. Just turn around for a minute, brothers. Turn around for a minute. Face the congregation. Identical twins or quadruplets or whatever you want to call them. No. Why? Brother Dan, put your hand up. Brother, raise your hand. Brother, raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Do they all raise them the same? &gt;&gt; No, they're all just a little bit different. &gt;&gt; Brothers, smile at them. I mean, show your teeth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're all just a little bit different. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible says you're fearful. Thank you, brothers. Thank you. I'm sorry if I put you on the spot. You forgive me and talk to your pastor. [applause] Bible says that we're fearfully and we're wonderfully made. And do you know what that means? That you come with uniquenesses that I don't come with. And God has wired you in a way that I am not wired. And he makes you a certain type of character. And there's things that just, you know, uh there's things that mean, Brother Paul, I'm going to use you this morning. Brother Barry, I'm going to use you because these I know these men personally. And I know their lives. And I know that they're contractors and I know the kind of workmanship they do. And I be embarrassed for them to come to my house. I'm building a house. But the moment they walk in, as much as they don't want to see it, they just want to come in and say, "Oh, nice place." Immediately, everything comes to light. All the flaws that show up, you know what? I could walk into your house a thousand times and never see one of those flaws. Cuz I'm not made that way. But you are made that way. And God built you that way. And he wants you that way. So why do we try to be like everybody else? God made you specifically the way you are. &gt;&gt; And he wants to use you the way he made you. I'm not here to criticize this man, that man, how they do this, how if that's the way they do it, praise God. That's what that works for them. It doesn't work for me. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that I'm any less a son than they are. &gt;&gt; Or any less a king than they are or any less a priest than they are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He He hath made us. &gt;&gt; He has made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I was I was in the office and I was enjoying your worship. I I said I said to Brother Barry, "Brother Paul must be just enjoying leading worship anymore." &gt;&gt; I mean, I I'm just be honest, man. Some of us are, you all laugh, but but the truth of it is I saw you right on camera, so you can't lie. Some of you white as I am, and you can't lift a hand. You can't even break a smile. I wonder if you know who's president. No, I don't. I take that back. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I take that back. And I'm sorry, Lord. We are all built differently. &gt;&gt; I take that back. We are all uniquely made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm so happy when I see people that just can let go and let God. And they, you know, I that's a person I want to be black in the inside, &gt;&gt; even if I'm white on the outside. I got a brother that's pretty close. And he's made us king. Oh, he has made us priests. Now I'm going back to to uh to what brother Brown said. Yes, he has made us priests unto him. Now what does a priest do? &gt;&gt; Offering spiritual praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. of sanctified lips, spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him, &gt;&gt; worshiping him in spirit and in truth, &gt;&gt; interceding and petitioning, &gt;&gt; priests and kings unto our God. &gt;&gt; You think, well, Brother Dwayne, I'm I'm I'm not a priest, aren't you? &gt;&gt; He said we're priests. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then let's act like them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's most sometimes this in our humanity. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the hardest thing I don't I don't know if I can speak for you right now, brother Barry, but I'm speak I'm going to speak for me. When I was a kid, I was the most shy kid in school. If I had to be in front of anybody, I melted. I never dreamt that I would be this today. But for a person to go from that to this, you've got to break through the uncomfortableness of your own self. And you got to keep letting God take a little getting a little victory out of your life. Little victory out of your life until you can just let go and let God. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when somebody, you know, if somebody would do something kind for you, you'd almost feel like, "Ah, I'm not worthy. I shouldn't." Listen, God's done the greatest thing, given us the greatest of all gifts. &gt;&gt; He's given us eternal life, &gt;&gt; made us kings and priests, &gt;&gt; and we still act like servants. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm not talking about arrogance as a king. The king of kings on this earth was the most humble man there was. &gt;&gt; But I am talking about taking our positions as kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Dwayne, you come to church. What do you come for? &gt;&gt; To offer a spiritual sacrifice &gt;&gt; to offer praise to the God, the the God of all gods. I'm talking about capital G God, not the little G gods. &gt;&gt; We come to offer ourselves as a as a sacrifice unto him. And if that means that I look silly to you, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. If that means I get, you know, we sing that little song, I'm going to get carried away when I get carried away. But why do we have to wait till we get carried away? Why can't we just worship him now as like we were there then? &gt;&gt; We're we're priests. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're priests. When somebody goes to hurting and God, the spirit of God comes on your life and he begins to to to look at that life, it's him that begins to intercede. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might pull you into a place where you're so burdened for somebody and nobody in the congregation is. But God's not looking at that. He wants you. &gt;&gt; He's using your life. &gt;&gt; And then he might take somebody else's life and do something. All of a sudden, uh, you know, they're sitting at home and the spirit of God comes on them and and and a song of worship is given to them. He wants them to bring it here right then and he wants them to express that. &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the spirit of God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's made us priests. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "No wonder the world does not appeal to us. &gt;&gt; We are a peculiar people, &gt;&gt; zealous unto unto good works. We been recreated in him to be children of the father. &gt;&gt; Seven church ages. Brother Brown says he's made us priests and kings. Lord God help me. Spiritual priesthood. A royal nation. Spiritual offering. What is it? Spiritual sacrifice. That's it. Fruits of our lips. &gt;&gt; Giving praise to his name. &gt;&gt; Man, if you can't sing, &gt;&gt; then clap. &gt;&gt; Make a noise. Make a noise. &gt;&gt; Stomp your foot. &gt;&gt; Wave your arms. Oh, I I get too uncomfortable waving your arms. Try it one time. &gt;&gt; I'll tell tell you a little story about a young brother back at home, young married man back at home. He said, "You know, we're we're pretty German back at home." And and and it has its goods and its bads, but this is not one of the the royal parts of a German. We are Christians &gt;&gt; above all. We're Christians, but our natures are very, you know, we're very boxed up and then it's not altogether good. And this [clears throat] young brother said, "Brother Dwayne, I was sitting in church. You've heard brother Brown say this." He said, "I was sitting in church the other day, brother. The word of God was coming. I wanted to shout so bad." I said, "Why didn't you?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Here's a 30-year-old man with a family who he's raising to serve God, and he's boxed up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How's your family ever going to get free if you're boxed up? &gt;&gt; I'm like, why didn't you? He says, I don't know. I just couldn't. I said, you know, if you would have done it, that brother would have done it. That brother would have done it. That brother cuz they're all sitting there with the same problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, church. You know, when David got to dancing and screaming and shouting and everybody else looked around, they looked down on him. No, no, no. David said, "Hey, you don't like this. Watch what happens tomorrow." &gt;&gt; What? What was it? Was David being facitious? Was he being a showman? No. His heart was so full of God that he just had to express it somehow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, you might not be the shout outer, but you might be like my daddy and this presence of God comes. He ain't going to shout on us. He's not going to stand on us. If he ever does, I'm going to I'm probably going to pass out. But he'll stand there and the tears of joy will just run down his I don't care if you shout. I don't care if you cry. I don't care if you wave your hands, if [screaming] you clap. I don't care. But do something. &gt;&gt; Just do something. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; If you can't, maybe you're not the worshipper in church, but go and take your worship to the street corners, to the to your job site, and tell him what God is doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; Tell him what he's done in your life. &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ram says, "Now we might as well get started right here." He said, "It's a good place." He said, "A little confusion comes in the church. Don't just turn around and run to one side and pout." Now, &gt;&gt; if you do, you're sure not a priest. &gt;&gt; You pray through. &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Oh, some of us have no trouble. I hope. My goodness, Lord God. Some of us have no trouble. you know, the offering plate comes around and we can put our offering in and we can pay our tithing and and we just feel just justified about that. I've done my duty. I'm a Christian now. But you realize that is the least &gt;&gt; of God's concerns. &gt;&gt; There's millions of people that do that. But God's not looking for that. He wants you. &gt;&gt; You become the tabernacle of the living God. &gt;&gt; God is still manifested in flesh. The word has taken on flesh &gt;&gt; and it's living. It's walking. It's talking. It's expressing itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice. The fruits of our lips giving praise. You say, "Well, I just don't feel like going to church." &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; you're a priest. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you don't have that problem right here, right now on Sunday morning. But I wonder what Wednesday night looks like in this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; How? Brother, listen. Don't hand me the excuses. I've heard them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Wayne, I don't I don't I don't have time to go home and then change and then come back and I've been working in the dirt all day long. Come to church with your dirty boots on. &gt;&gt; Who says we got to come to church in a suit and a tie? &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Give them your best." But if the best you got that day is your dirty boots and your dirty shoes. Listen, I used to work I used to live in a farming community. And I and we live I I worked with a bunch of mechanics, you know, in in the heat of the season. They didn't have time to go home and change. Those boys would come to work, grease up to here, they would wash off what they could, leave their boots at the door, roll their pants up, and walk in in their socks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo! &gt;&gt; God forbid we would ever come to church like that. Listen, they're there telling the enemy, "Listen, I am on the winning side. I am on the winning side. I don't care if my boots don't if I'm wearing my work boots. I don't care if my hair looks like this and that. I, you know, I pull my hat off and it's everywhere. It It just doesn't matter. We're here to worship. You think God cares about your nice suit that you brought to church and just paid $1,200 for? &gt;&gt; No more than he cares about that young man's suit. No, let me rephrase this. My suit that my wife bought at a at a secondhand store for probably $50 and I've wore it for way too long. And he don't care. &gt;&gt; He just wants to hear you. &gt;&gt; He just wants you to love him. &gt;&gt; He just wants you to come as you are. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; it's time that we just let let God have his wonderful way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well," he says, "but you're a priest. It's your duty. You've got to be there." Well, I just don't feel like taking part in the service. You're a priest. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. &gt;&gt; I'm a priest. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad you agree. Now, let's let's just let's just make this real this morning. I'm a &gt;&gt; priest. &gt;&gt; Well, I heard one man say, "I'm try this again. I'm &gt;&gt; a priest." &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister. &gt;&gt; She actually said, "I'm &gt;&gt; a priest." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. This is not about your neighbor. &gt;&gt; We come to church and we complain and we say, "Ah, you know what? H yeah, nobody wants to worship. Nobody. What about you? &gt;&gt; What about you? Be the David. &gt;&gt; He says, "Listen, I don't feel like taking part in the service. You're a priest making a spiritual sacrifice. &gt;&gt; A spiritual &gt;&gt; sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Barry, you're going to beat me to death when I leave here. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I'm not done yet. It just hit me. &gt;&gt; You're a priest making a spiritual sacrifice. You know, we got we got people that'll get up 5:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; They'll sit for two and a half hours to get into their day, &gt;&gt; then head off to work. They'll work hard all day, rush home six o'clock at night. I'm talking about a Wednesday &gt;&gt; and sit down in church. Didn't I just read that you have dominion &gt;&gt; over sin, &gt;&gt; the world, &gt;&gt; your flesh? &gt;&gt; How wonderome. You know what? We can schedule it. I got to schedule a meeting with brother Barry. If I want to see him, I got to schedule this brother. I got to schedule that thing. I got to We got scheduled daytime books full of schedules. &gt;&gt; But you can't schedule what? You can't schedule one hour to take a nap &gt;&gt; so that this little body is recharged when it comes to church. It's ready to receive something of of eternal value. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're you're you're on thin ice, Brother Dwayne. I know it. I know it. I remember you used to work night shift, come home at 7:00 Sunday morning after 12 hours of night shift, go to bed for an hour or an hour and 15 minutes and get up, take my kids to church." You know what I knew? If I sat down in the chair, &gt;&gt; guess what was going to happen? Cuz I'm just flesh and blood. So, you know what I'd do? I'd get up and I'd walk back and forth. &gt;&gt; I went out to the back and I would just stand there until I was tired. Then I start walking this way &gt;&gt; just to let the enemy know &gt;&gt; whose side I am on. &gt;&gt; We have dominion over &gt;&gt; sin. &gt;&gt; The world. &gt;&gt; The flesh. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Dominion over sin. &gt;&gt; The world. the flesh &gt;&gt; and the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm hurting, buddy. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let me go back. Let me let me finish this this morning. &gt;&gt; I should call the musicians and that might that might help, but they say no. So, I don't I don't know. I want to &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; yeah. Thank you, brother. I don't know where it's at. So, so far we're doing good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Scripture says this, "You're a chosen generation." Listen, there's no mystery that the the the show The Chosen &gt;&gt; has come out, as good as it might be, and I I I haven't seen too much of it. I'm just being honest. Uh the the one or two that I did see were very good, and I wouldn't never take it away from anyway. But there's a reason that that even the title of that has become such a a great thing in this world because there is a reality that there is a chosen group of people. &gt;&gt; A royal priesthood, &gt;&gt; a holy, did I just say royal &gt;&gt; priesthood? &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; we're not peasants. We're not poppers. We're not slaves. We're free in Christ. &gt;&gt; We are children of the most high God. &gt;&gt; There's a reason Satan hates you. &gt;&gt; Because he hated him. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5 said, "Be followers of Christ as dear children and walk in the love of God as Christ has loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I am going to try and close. We read the scriptures that Jesus was the prince of the kings of the earth. I got looking at you the reality of Mphibicheth and how that applies to our lives. And I also got looking at the great king of kings. &gt;&gt; The lord of lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The high priest, the great high priest. I got looking at his life and and and I got thinking, you know, like we spoke earlier, kings in today's world, we've all seen little reflections of this on YouTube. You take a king in some of those foreign countries, the entourage that goes with them, the glory that surrounds them. They show you their palaces and their kingdoms and their cars and and as a natural person, you go, "Why can't I have that?" &gt;&gt; You don't want it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't want it. &gt;&gt; You're right. &gt;&gt; What we want &gt;&gt; is whatever he has &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The king of kings &gt;&gt; left the glory which this world couldn't compare with. left the glory of heavens and when he stepped into the face of this earth, &gt;&gt; how did he come? &gt;&gt; How did he come? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, his entourage didn't look very big. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible said, you know, the foxes have dens, the birds have nests, but I don't even have a place to lay my head. &gt;&gt; Does that mean we should be the same? No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying look at the quality of his character. Look what he held as the uh uh as the most essential things &gt;&gt; as things of real value. &gt;&gt; It just made me think, you know, he didn't come running he didn't come rolling into Jerusalem that day uh you know on uh a white charger or in what we'd say today, you know, stretched out what would you call it? What's &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; Limousine. &gt;&gt; Limousine. Yeah. You know, he didn't come with, you know, the tinted windows and the armed guards and rolling into town. But the Bible says he came on the back of a donkey. &gt;&gt; He came on the back of a donkey. &gt;&gt; Nothing. A little fool, didn't you know? And yet the crowds, the crowds looked at him and they screamed, "Hosana to the &gt;&gt; highest." &gt;&gt; They called him their king. &gt;&gt; They wanted him to be their king. &gt;&gt; They as far as they're concerned, he is the coming king. &gt;&gt; You know, he he he could have come in with banners flying. He could have come in with with with with, you know, everything blaring his name and here I am and I've come to save the world. He could have come like that. He could have come that way cuz he was the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; He was the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Every devil in hell was subject to him. And he knew it and they knew it. &gt;&gt; He could speak and things would happen. &gt;&gt; He was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was God. And yet that one being allowed himself, I'll just say it this way, allowed himself to go through to Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; And if you look at what that word means, it means the oil press. What happened in the garden of Gethsemane? It was there that he struggled with his will &gt;&gt; and father's will. &gt;&gt; You say, well, he's how can that be, brother? cuz he was all man &gt;&gt; but he was all God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And &gt;&gt; sometimes we have to come to the Gethsemane in our own lives &gt;&gt; where we struggle. We pray through &gt;&gt; from Lord not my will &gt;&gt; but thine be done. &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he understood who he was. He knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't he wasn't ashamed. He knew who he was. He knew he could speak. &gt;&gt; 10 legions of angels had come. &gt;&gt; He knew it was that way. &gt;&gt; But he suffered &gt;&gt; uh the most intense sufferings to become a priest that could understand my suffering. &gt;&gt; He went through the very things that you go through to understand your suffering. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to use this as a reflection. Sometimes you go through things and you think, "Oh, God, why? Why, Lord, did I have to go through this? But listen, you need to be. &gt;&gt; He's made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; And how can we really understand unless we've been through it? How can we really enter into somebody's suffering unless we've been through that? &gt;&gt; And some of you have went through things that are so hard and you think, "Oh, God, why does it have to be that way?" So that he can take you as a priest &gt;&gt; and you can become that intercessor. Listen, I'm not talking between man and God. I'm just talking about standing there for your brother standing there with react. Listen, I don't know what it's like to lose somebody that's real personal close to me like like one of my siblings or something like but some of you do. &gt;&gt; And you can enter into the suffering of somebody that's going through that. &gt;&gt; You can. &gt;&gt; I know what it's like to lose almost everything. I know what it's like to have a body that's so broken that I don't know what to do with it. I can enter into those things, but I can't enter into this. But some of you can. &gt;&gt; God allows you to go through things as part of the molding process. &gt;&gt; So he can use it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he can use the vessel. &gt;&gt; I just think this way we know here's the King of Kings and I want to I want to just close on this thought. Here's the King of Kings. I mean, every angelic host should have been standing with trumpets blowing. &gt;&gt; This is your hour of redemption. &gt;&gt; But nothing. &gt;&gt; Matters of fact then that are closest to him. I don't even know him. &gt;&gt; No part of him. Right. &gt;&gt; I say this is where here comes the the King of Kings. If I would title this something, I would I would title it the limping prince. &gt;&gt; Remember, he was the prince of the kings of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here comes the walk of glory. &gt;&gt; Here comes the walk of glory. Not while he was raising Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Not while he was touching the woman with a blood issue. &gt;&gt; Not while he was raising up uh Gyrus's daughter. This is how we would look at glory. &gt;&gt; But the real walk of glory was when the King of Kings, &gt;&gt; beaten, bruised, broken, &gt;&gt; and the sins of the world &gt;&gt; laid on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; Listen, no longer with his back, chest out as a if I could use that, I don't mean that in the wrong way. You understand? as a as a man, 30-year-old man in the prime of his life, walking this time broken. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? &gt;&gt; He became a limping prince. &gt;&gt; He became a limping prince so that you could walk &gt;&gt; a straight line. &gt;&gt; He became broken so that I could become whole. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was bruised so that I my life could be put together. &gt;&gt; Listen, he was he was the limping &gt;&gt; prince. &gt;&gt; Wasn't a walk of shame. It was the walk of glory. &gt;&gt; It was the He carried my burden. He carried me on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; He carried my sin and nailed it to a cross. He annihilated my shame. &gt;&gt; He took it upon himself. Listen, when he stood there in in in Pilot's hall, he was rejected so I could be accepted. &gt;&gt; He has made [screaming] me &gt;&gt; a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, he maybe didn't look like a king, &gt;&gt; but he was a king. &gt;&gt; He maybe wasn't walking like a king, but he was a king. &gt;&gt; Not a king. He was the king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did God forget him? &gt;&gt; Not even close. &gt;&gt; Not even close. When Pilate wanted to forget him, when the rest of the the soldiers wanted to forget him. When the Sanhedrin would like to have forgot him. When everybody would like to forgot him, but God didn't forget him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me turn over to 2 Samuel. If the musicians would come, I'm closing right now. I promise you. 2 Samuel back to 2 Samuel chapter nine says and David this is now he's he's found Mphibicheth. Aren't you glad he found you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And David said unto him, "Fear not. I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake." Now listen to this. Now here's God's thoughts to you this morning, church. Here's God's thought to you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how broken you've been, regardless of what kind of a I want to say, you know, your walk might have been this way. It might have been that way. It might have been anything but what a Christian ought to be. But here's what God thinks of you this morning. &gt;&gt; Here's what God thinks of you this morning. &gt;&gt; David said unto him, "Fear not. I will surely show kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and I will restore &gt;&gt; thee." Amen. &gt;&gt; All the land &gt;&gt; of Saul thy father &gt;&gt; and thou shalt eat bread at my table &gt;&gt; continually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; He bowed himself and said, "What is thy servant that thou should look upon such a dead dog as I?" &gt;&gt; Here's Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; Lord God, who am I? &gt;&gt; Lord, what Lord? How whom who am I? What? What? What have I ever done to deserve to be in your presence? &gt;&gt; How why would you even look on me? There's there's many people that are so much better. Why would you even look on me? &gt;&gt; But I want you to see God's desire for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the king called to Zeba the Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son, all that pertain unto Saul and to his house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, they shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat. But Mphibicheth But Mphibicheth, thy master's son, shall eat bread always at my table. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I can pull up my chair. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not at David's table, but at King of Kings, &gt;&gt; the Lord of Lords. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt bring in the fruits, and thy master's son may have [music] food to eat. But Mphibicheth, thy master's son, shall eat bread always at my table. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Zeba had 15 sons and 20 servants. And then said Zeba unto the king, according to all that my lord, the king has commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. &gt;&gt; As for Mphibicheth, said the king, &gt;&gt; listen this. He's confirming. He's reconfirming this. &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan. &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan. &gt;&gt; I have a place &gt;&gt; at the king's table. &gt;&gt; I have a place &gt;&gt; at the king's table. Amen. &gt;&gt; As for Mash Mphibicheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table &gt;&gt; as one of the king's sons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As one of the king's sons. &gt;&gt; Saints, you've got a place &gt;&gt; at the table of God this morning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been called to be the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with that comes a special position, a special anointing. And God himself &gt;&gt; has said that you are kings. &gt;&gt; That means that you will rule over &gt;&gt; sin, &gt;&gt; the world, [music] &gt;&gt; the flesh, &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; can we say that again? &gt;&gt; Sin. the world, &gt;&gt; the flesh, &gt;&gt; and the devil. Do you realize there's four in there? &gt;&gt; What's the number man? &gt;&gt; Four. &gt;&gt; We're without excuse. &gt;&gt; You don't have to succumb to everything Satan throws your way. &gt;&gt; We've been made more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that this morning? We've been made more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet as brother Barry comes. We've been made [singing] more than coner, overcomers in this life. Oh, I've been [singing] made victorious [music] through the blood of Jesus. Let's sing it again. Hallelujah. Oh, I've been made more than a coner and overcomer [singing] in this life. [music] I've been made victorious [singing] [music] through the love of Jesus Christ. [singing] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for the [singing] glor through the [music] blood of [singing] Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you hear something about you today? [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I heard from my theophony &gt;&gt; and you know the one thing that really jumped out to me there's a few one thing that really jumped out to me as a son of God. I don't look like it. I don't feel [music] like it. But day by day I'm starting to act like it. There's identifiers &gt;&gt; when we know we're sons and daughters of the king. &gt;&gt; But you know, I wrote something down in my notes about halfway through the service. And you know, we're not wrestling against flesh and blood. And he's given us authority, hasn't he? &gt;&gt; He's given us authority. &gt;&gt; He's given us authority over sin, &gt;&gt; over the world, &gt;&gt; over this flesh, and over the devil. He's given us. &gt;&gt; But I I just had this thought come to me. He's given me full authority over me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And for us to say that we've got something in our lives that's greater than the authority that he has given us &gt;&gt; is pretty near blasphemous. &gt;&gt; It just occurred to me today how powerful that is. He is the King of Kings. He is the Lord of Lords. And he has given us his authority &gt;&gt; over all of it, &gt;&gt; especially ourselves. &gt;&gt; Let us not say there's something greater in us &gt;&gt; than him. &gt;&gt; I just uh was also thinking right at the very beginning, the inspiration is beautiful. &gt;&gt; I used to be a contractor, now I'm not. But you know, one of the most frustrating things was actually peeling back the layers &gt;&gt; so that you could actually do a good work. &gt;&gt; And you have to peel back the layers until you get there to the foundation to the beginning. And you know, one of the most frustrating parts as a contractor, I'll say this and I just can't help but think it's a lot like the box car story brother Brandham talks about. When you go through the entire process and you get all the layers peeled back and you think you have all the screws pulled out and everything is ready to go and you schedule the drywallers to come, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they get set up and they go to put up a piece of board and they find out that someone didn't take out that corner of drywall with a screw in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now they've got to stop everything and start over again with the cleanup process. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just occurred to me it's a lot like the box car brother Brandham talked about. When the inspector comes by, he's going to take that box car and shake it &gt;&gt; to see if it's been packed properly. And if it's not been packed properly, he's not going to put his seal on it. &gt;&gt; He's going to walk away. And we've talked about in the past, he does not pack box cars. The inspector doesn't pack them or unpack them. We do. &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we've got it ready &gt;&gt; when the drywaller comes. when the inspector comes that we're 100% ready. Don't leave any lingering screws and bits of drywall layers. Let's peel back the layers and just get honest &gt;&gt; so that he can do the good work in our lives. &gt;&gt; Really enjoyed that this morning, Brother Dwayne. Thank you for yielding. God bless you, brother. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I also just wanted to take a moment and appreciate Sister Charmaine's sister. God bless you, sister. [applause] &gt;&gt; Sister Alice, and I'm sorry I don't know your last name, but they're from Alaska. And she's here uh with her friend, Sister Fran &gt;&gt; Francis. &gt;&gt; Franis. Amen. I trust you feel right at home. God bless you. [applause] We certainly miss our sister Charmaine. &gt;&gt; There's a hole that will never be filled on this side of eternity. &gt;&gt; She's over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we know we've heard from you today. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we just thank you for your goodness and your many tender mercies to each and every one of us in our lives. We thank you, Lord, for showing us that there's not one layer of this humanity that's worth anything. &gt;&gt; That every single layer has to be stripped off. And if we peel back a layer and we see that there's something else, we have to take the time and do the work to peel it back, too. &gt;&gt; And to just continue peeling back until we get right down to our very hearts &gt;&gt; where you can actually do something with us, where we're actually honest with ourselves, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because until we get to that place of 100% honest &gt;&gt; and genuine sincerity, &gt;&gt; we're going to keep going around the circle and wondering why we have these problems. And Lord, help us not say that we have something in our lives greater than you that would hinder your power from delivering us from ourselves. &gt;&gt; We heard it this morning. You said it to us through your prophet. You have given us authority. &gt;&gt; Let us stand upon that authority, Father. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that in the Old Testament, it was not possible for someone to be a king or a [music] priest. They were one or the other. Now, it behooves us to be both because that's your word. And if we claim to be only one and not the other, then we're coming contrary to your word. Oh, Father, that will give us a hybrid religion that will not bring life. We just ask, Lord, that you would help us to peel back the layers. Help us to be honest with you, Father, &gt;&gt; that you could do the good work in our lives. &gt;&gt; Bless Brother Dwayne, Lord, Sister Connie, and the congregation back at Saskatoon Tabernacle. We know the devil is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. But we're so thankful that you told us in this age that he's a bluff because he can roar, but he has no bite. [music] So, Father, we pray that you would just restore our brother's strength, Lord. &gt;&gt; Continue blessing the saints. Let him feed the sheep there. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, now we pray that you would just be glorified with a couple songs, Father, before we go our separate ways. And when we do finally part ways today, Father, we pray that you would just continue resounding in our ears that you have given us authority, &gt;&gt; oh Father. And that authority isn't for another time or dimension. We're not going to change our characters. You're going to do that now. &gt;&gt; And we give you the preeminence and the liberty that you desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? When the redeemed are gathering in. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on high. When the [music and singing] redeemed are gathering in, how we'll raise the heavenly [singing] midnight [music] city in the sky. When the redee [music and singing] are gathering in, we don't have to wait. When we are [music] gathering in [singing] like snow and [music] we will see how we will &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Heat.
