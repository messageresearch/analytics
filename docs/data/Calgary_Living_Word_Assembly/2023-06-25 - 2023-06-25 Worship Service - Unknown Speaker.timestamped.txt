[1:10:21] oh
[1:10:23] Lord
[1:10:25] for your name is great and greatly
[1:10:33] amazing
[1:10:42] and we have a testimony from sister
[1:10:44] Michelle
[1:10:45] and after that we're going to call on
[1:10:49] some children they have a special song
[1:10:51] then brother Murphy will be after that
[1:11:08] is this on yeah
[1:11:09] I haven't given this test 3 for about 17
[1:11:13] years
[1:11:14] it's about this viola
[1:11:17] I was 20 when I started the viola
[1:11:20] and I actually had never heard one or
[1:11:22] knew what it was and I decided I want to
[1:11:24] learn the viola because someone said it
[1:11:26] sounded lower than a violin so I thought
[1:11:28] okay that's better because the high
[1:11:30] pitch of the violin can get irritating
[1:11:32] sometimes for me
[1:11:34] so I got a student violin which was a
[1:11:38] smaller size
[1:11:40] and what I didn't know
[1:11:42] is when you get a violin a viola it
[1:11:45] should fit in your hand like that
[1:11:48] I've got narrow shoulders and short arms
[1:11:51] I was not built for riviola
[1:11:54] but nobody told me
[1:11:56] so the student viola was fine but as I
[1:11:59] progressed and I upgraded
[1:12:01] I ended up with this
[1:12:04] what my teacher called a truck
[1:12:06] it just I could not work it and she
[1:12:09] would say get you know just get this
[1:12:11] right get that right and I couldn't get
[1:12:13] it right
[1:12:14] and then she took my Viola and she tried
[1:12:17] to do it and she said no man you this
[1:12:18] isn't working this isn't right she
[1:12:20] couldn't even get it right on that thing
[1:12:22] she says you're gonna have to upgrade
[1:12:25] but
[1:12:26] um I don't know if you know but with
[1:12:28] instruments like this the older they are
[1:12:30] the better
[1:12:32] so I want I got the desire for an
[1:12:35] antique
[1:12:36] antiques are very expensive they're very
[1:12:39] hard to get a hold of
[1:12:40] and our budget wasn't that big but I
[1:12:43] prayed and my gift of music was
[1:12:46] dedicated to the Lord right from the
[1:12:48] beginning
[1:12:49] I had the opportunity to study at a
[1:12:51] college but they told me I'd have to
[1:12:53] play rock and Jazz and perform all
[1:12:56] different genres and I said no I'm not
[1:12:58] doing that
[1:12:59] because my gift is for the Lord alone
[1:13:02] so I trusted him
[1:13:04] and my dad took me we went and tried
[1:13:07] three different violas it was an hour's
[1:13:09] drive this way and hours drive that way
[1:13:11] over months and eventually I ended up in
[1:13:13] the Yellow Pages
[1:13:15] and those of you whom My Generation
[1:13:18] might remember the Yellow Pages it's a
[1:13:20] phone book where you have to look up
[1:13:22] numbers no internet no Google
[1:13:25] and um
[1:13:27] there was this music import export and I
[1:13:31] phoned this man his name was Laszlo and
[1:13:33] I said I'm looking for an antique viola
[1:13:36] and he says okay he'll keep an eye out
[1:13:38] and with and I'd prayed and that was
[1:13:41] like the last resort we'd even been to a
[1:13:43] violent maker but he was too expensive
[1:13:46] and um
[1:13:50] one day he phoned me it was just like
[1:13:52] within a week he said I've got a viola
[1:13:54] for you in antique
[1:13:55] and I was like wow so my mom and I we
[1:13:59] drove all the way to his house we got
[1:14:03] there and he took me into a stone
[1:14:06] basement the walls were this thick
[1:14:09] he had dim lighting and he brought out
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:14] Viola in a case
[1:14:16] and I'd prayed
[1:14:19] I said Lord when I play this instrument
[1:14:21] that's the right one I want an
[1:14:24] atmosphere I wanted to be a feeling I
[1:14:27] must know
[1:14:29] and when I played this
[1:14:32] the Acoustics everything was just
[1:14:34] wonderful and there was feeling
[1:14:38] it was expensive though
[1:14:40] and it's got cracks
[1:14:43] so I was nervous and I didn't know but I
[1:14:46] got the feeling
[1:14:48] so I said to my mom this is the one
[1:14:51] and
[1:14:53] so she had to go to the banks it was was
[1:14:55] before e-transfer
[1:14:57] quickly get to the bank before it closed
[1:14:59] with this man
[1:15:01] and um
[1:15:04] I took it to my first Viola lesson with
[1:15:06] it
[1:15:07] and my teachers took one look at it she
[1:15:10] said
[1:15:11] I don't know what that is but that's not
[1:15:13] a viola
[1:15:14] what is Laszlo sold you
[1:15:17] so of course I was horrified we spent
[1:15:20] all this money There's No Going Back
[1:15:23] and
[1:15:25] I prayed that night was Wednesday night
[1:15:27] we had prayer meeting
[1:15:29] and I just said I'm going to dedicate
[1:15:32] this instrument to the Lord and I know
[1:15:34] it's going to be okay and then the
[1:15:36] pastor forgot to dedicate it to the Lord
[1:15:38] at the beginning of the service and
[1:15:40] during the service I just thought well
[1:15:42] if he would just lay hands on it I know
[1:15:44] it will be okay cracks and all
[1:15:46] and at the end of the services I forgot
[1:15:49] to pray for your instrument won't you
[1:15:51] give it to me sister Michelle and I'll
[1:15:52] pray for your instrument and then I knew
[1:15:55] it's going to be okay
[1:15:57] but my dad's a German
[1:15:59] and nothing can be in any state of
[1:16:02] disrepair so we went to the violin maker
[1:16:05] to see about the cracks
[1:16:07] and the violin maker had a look at these
[1:16:09] cracks
[1:16:10] and he looked at the label inside the
[1:16:12] viola
[1:16:14] and he said he found exactly who had
[1:16:17] made it
[1:16:18] and it was made in 1900
[1:16:21] it's one of a hundred instruments of its
[1:16:24] type it is not a viola it is actually a
[1:16:27] tenor violin and they made it with five
[1:16:31] strings you can actually see the one peg
[1:16:33] hole has been closed here
[1:16:35] and
[1:16:39] it's made to have the full strings of
[1:16:41] the viola plus the high string of the
[1:16:43] violin
[1:16:44] but they weren't very popular because
[1:16:46] they're not very loud
[1:16:48] so they discontinued them
[1:16:50] but I just want to show you this
[1:16:51] instrument
[1:16:53] it's perfect
[1:16:56] for me
[1:17:01] so the Lord
[1:17:03] preserved it through two world wars
[1:17:07] with cracks and all
[1:17:10] and I just see my life we've gone
[1:17:13] through battles we go through things
[1:17:14] cracks and all the Lord can still use us
[1:17:18] and make something beautiful
[1:17:21] so I'd like you to join me the song I
[1:17:23] played when I the first song I played
[1:17:25] was Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine
