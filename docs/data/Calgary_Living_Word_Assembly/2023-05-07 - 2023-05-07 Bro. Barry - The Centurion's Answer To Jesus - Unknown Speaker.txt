too many times here on this side of Eternity Lord because we know that you've been so good to us father if we have breath in our lungs father you've been good to us father if we have health in our body Lord you've been good to us Lord if we can see with our eyes Lord Jesus you've been good to us Lord father if we have the ability to walk father been so good to us father let us never take it for granted Lord Jesus your goodness to us father we love you this morning and we thank you for your goodness Lord oh Lord Jesus we just ask that you would just Lord pour out your spirit on us today Father some more of that goodness Lord there's no way that we could ever do anything on our own Lord Jesus we just want to entrust everything in our lives unto you father all of our thoughts Lord that come into our minds help us to take them into captivity father and Lord let us run them through that mind that was once in Christ Jesus that's now in your bride father let us just filter the thoughts Lord and train our thinking to be according to your will Lord Jesus father then we'll ask the right things father then we'll say the right things Lord Jesus then we'll think the right thoughts father oh Lord Jesus and most of all we'll see the right results father we're not looking for many signs and wonders we're looking for obedience to the word our ability to line up with your word father because we know that's the only way the only truth and the only life in this day in which we live father we we just thank you for all that you're doing Lord we want to just continue to thank you Father for meeting the needs that we've made known unto you today Lord oh Father sometimes it can seem so many times but Lord we're not asking now we're thanking you father for meeting the needs according to your will which is your word today father thank you for touching brother Rory Wilson Lord according to your word father thank you for touching Isaiah Thomas Lord Jesus according to your word Lord Jesus oh Father we thank you for all of the many needs made note unto you this morning Lord Jesus by an uplift hand we thank you for meeting those needs as well father because we knew that you knew about them before we were even conscious of them Father and Lord you are that kind of a God we know that you just allow us to recognize them so that we can bring them to you father that you can be that good father and just show us your wonderful way Lord Jesus one more time we just want to commit everything in this service Lord everything in our lives into your hands father help us to step aside from this world Lord father that we could just blend the dimensions this morning we know we've heard it said that there's coming a day where this this Dimension will slightly speed up father and that other dimension will slightly slow down lord and there will just be a blending of Time and Eternity Lord Jesus where we'll hear from our theophories Lord that's why we've gathered today so once again we want to hear from our theophories that we would just have that reminder that this world that we see this is not it this is only the negative father but there's something great in store for your children and father we press towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus according to your word Lord father we love you and we thank you today we just ask that you would bless our service now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Hallelujah God bless you this morning musicians just wanna invite you to Matthew chapter 8 this morning have your Bibles Matthew chapter 8. start reading with verse 13. actually sorry Matthew 8. Matthew chapter 8 verse 5. I apologize Matthew chapter 8 verse 5 when Jesus was entered into Capernaum that came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented my Bible says paralyzed there and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go when he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and the west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping a gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you for the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church Lord father we pray that today would not be just a bunch of words father that are spoken that are just buzzwords according to the message of the hour but Lord Jesus that your spirit would Quicken this word as it's spoken today and father that it wouldn't even be me that speaks it Lord that you would come by here and speak to all of us this morning Father we pray that we could just Commit This service into your hands Lord we have Lord we've set the atmosphere we have all the mechanics lord it's all oiled up now and father we just desire the Dynamics father to come on the scene and add a spark Lord Jesus to this word father that when we leave this building as our brother prayed already that we would say just like those on the road to Emmaus oh Father our hearts burned within us but Lord Jesus let our hearts not just burn within us while we're here but let our hearts burn within us as we go from here father as we live our lives Lord Jesus let it be the testimony of Jesus Christ in our lives father we love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I bless you this morning you may be seated I just have a couple of announcements before we get too far here um it's shaping up to be a wonderful summer we uh we have a gym night coming up at Central Memorial on the 12th that's seven to nine PM we have two hours so we'll probably have uh just a good time maybe some volleyball and some other games we're working on some other stuff so hopefully we'll be able to have a good time and uh just fellowship with one another let our hair down so to speak on the 13th there's a ladies brunch it's going to be at our house I guess and on the 19th we have a prayer meeting scheduled for the seven 7 30 in the evening here at the church the 21st we have a potluck scheduled at two o'clock at our house once again it'll be the the first one actually of the season and we're very much looking forward to it uh oh I got the dates wrong I apologize please refer to the calendar that's online we have those items happening I think we have a convenience service on the 28th I think that's correct um just just refer to the calendar that's online um yeah so we have all of those events happening but please confirm online to the calendar that would be greatly appreciated it's going to be a busy month and I think the Lord will certainly bless us be happy this morning we have some guest Ministry coming in and I think I mentioned it a while back but we have brother Dale Smith coming June the 7th and it's surprising because that's not very far away I was looking at the calendars and I'm sure that's the date I confirmed that one so brother Dale Smith will be here on June the 7th for one service that's a Wednesday evening and if you've never heard brother Dale Smith I highly recommend checking it out it's uh it's real good I remember when I first started coming to church in the upper room brother Dale Smith he was here in the upper room and he preached a sermon called a snake bit dog and and what a tremendous sermon that that was all about a man that get gets bit by a snake a dog that gets bit by a snake man's best friend and how that dog is supposed to be man's best friend but once it's bit by the snake and that poison that Venom gets running through his veins he'll never come to his best friend his best friend is a man but he won't come to his best friend and he likened it to a human that gets bit by the devil that gets bit by a spirit and when that Spirit starts coursing through the veins oh he had such graphic descriptions boy I won't go too far into it but uh it was a tremendous message brother Dale Smith has a way of of really bringing things to life um that's in June in July we have uh brother Danny Daniel del mundo from Philippines we don't have the dates confirmed but he's coming with his family and we'll see what we can do for the dates and how it will all work out but we're trying to facilitate that in July and then we have another brother coming I don't know if he's ever been here before brother Andrew Glover I'm sure that some people have heard of him he's from the south and uh he'll probably be coming in August again it's sort of soft dates we're just trying to put it together it takes a bit to actually get these schedules lined up but we'll just see what the Lord has in store because we know when things line up it's the will of the Lord so uh yeah we're trying to see what the Lord will do isn't it wonderful I I never want to forget it and I want to always try and remember what was it like with covid there was a time where these doors were closed and I remember sitting here with a laptop one time maybe two with nobody else in the church at all it was just me and there's times where we had 12 people I think uh just enough people to lead songs remember singing to nobody brother Paul except for the Lord there's no people here we don't sing to one another but we sing to the Lord I get it but it's kind of tough to preach to no no audience here it's kind of tough to sing to nobody with nobody but when we get together there's something special that happens when we bring our licks of fire together and I think it's important to just remember that we have this ability this is a gift from God we never want to ever take it for granted that this is just the way it's always going to be because we saw it and just about in the moment in a twinkling of an eye it changed forever is what it seemed like but you know the Lord is good I believe that was just an example of what's yet to come that was simply a birth pain brother Branham talked about that the world is going through birth pains and that's exactly what we've experienced in our day we know that the world is now under the complete control we know it's been for years according to what the prophet said but now it's under the complete control of someone somewhere somehow and I don't know whether there's a live virus I don't know whether the vaccine's good or bad the only thing I know is that the word of God stands true and you know we can say one way or the other way and that's exactly what the devil wants us to do is to get into a thing about whatever whether it's real or whether it's not the one thing that is real is something got the attention of the entire world all at the very same time and I would say it's just a test of the Beast system just to see if we can actually put our finger on the pulse and push the button in every single country around the world and everyone will comply to some way or another and every country did this affected the whole entire world so brothers and sisters we never want to take it for granted what a tremendous thing it is to get together maybe I'm just going on and I apologize if it sounds like I'm rambling but it's just wonderful to get together with our brothers and sisters of like Precious faith because that's what we're instructed to do that's why it does something to us talking today about this Centurion and you know kind of just going forwards with the thought that we've had in the past talking about our words and and we had talked a bit about spiritual viruses and how we can be a carrier of a spiritual virus and not even recognize it and pass it off to someone and someone can take it and maybe it won't affect them and they can pass it off to someone and maybe it won't affect them and it can just do that it can just go around and be alive but not really affect anyone but there's one person might pick up that that spiritual virus and it travels by words that we speak and when they get that it can actually put them on spiritual life support brothers and sisters they come to a place where they start to question uh the word of God and maybe even the message of the hour wasn't it a beautiful message on Wednesday that brother Toby got got up here and ministered just took the time to lay out you know what we believe is not he said it a couple times cunningly devised fables of men what we believe is the truth according to the word for our day and we're going to get into it a bit today I think it's such a beautiful beautiful thing you know we're not just gathering around a man we're gathering around the word of God and all that we believe is what Paul preached and all the people that claim to be the Christians around the world claim to believe what Paul preached but does everybody take what Paul preached and apply it or do they say that well that was for a different day that was for a different culture that was for a different thing sometimes that seems to be the way it is and we don't want to put anybody in or anybody out but all I can say is God's not going to say did you did you did you accept my word according to what you were taught or did you accept my word according to the way I sent it to you we're going to be given the option to to accept it or reject it and you know choosing to reject Truth for our day is making a choice and we want to make sure that we make the right choice because we know that just a little further in uh backwards actually in in Matthew not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and surely to goodness they will have prophesied in the name of Jesus and in the name in thy name have cast out Devils sure they will have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works tremendous works maybe people raised from the dead may be healed from sickness maybe bank accounts full maybe vehicles that just die someone prays over maybe they lay hands on a vehicle and it just comes to life again we hear about stories where people are crashing having a terrible accident in their vehicle and suddenly they're just on the side of the road and everything is fine there's no issues many wonderful works but he's going to say not that you do all of that did you follow my word did you follow the word of God for your day because we know he's the same yesterday today and forever and we always go back to it but I think it's such an easy simple description and God is like that he likes to make sure that we understand he doesn't give us such a a great mystery that we just can't understand it and I think if somebody does preach a mystery that is incomprehensible that we don't understand it I want to ask are they preaching Truth for our day because we've been given the entire mystery the entire word of God has been open to us it's no longer a mystery brothers and sisters [Applause] but Noah his message was simple It's Gonna Rain God said build a boat if you want to be saved get in a boat quite simple but then what happened Satan got into reasoning part of people's minds and said well it's never rained before and we've got scientific achievement and we can send Rockets up into the atmosphere and prove contrary to the word that you're trying to tell us Noah we can prove it scientifically it's never rained before and it's never going to rain consciously reasonably you're talking about something that's insane why would you talk that way and Noah would say because God said so because I heard God speak to me directly he made me his his Messenger on Earth for the day and now the people had the opportunity to accept him as the messenger or reject him as the messenger and those people that accepted him as the messenger they survived and the people that rejected him they didn't live the the breath that was in their lungs that was that gift we prayed about earlier it was just taken away they lost that gift there might have been people that said you know I I believe that you're his messenger but I just don't like your boat I just don't like the way you've built your boat I think it could be done better so I'm just gonna go and build my own boat and I'm going to be close by and I'm going to be watching what happens and we'll just see what happens if it starts to rain we'll just jump in our boat and maybe we've built all of the the technology that you've built into your boat into our boat but God said there's only one messenger in that day and if you follow his word you'll live but any other way you'll die not everyone that's saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven I had spoken about this little while ago brothers and sisters what is his will which is in heaven what is his will his will is his word right that's what his will is it's not what a theologian would say it's not what a pastor would say it's not what an evangelist would say and I will go so far as to say it's not even what a prophet would say if it were not the inspiration of the Holy Ghost living out through that Prophet because the prophet original right Paul he said if an angel or anybody else speak anything different than what I've already told you let him be accursed even if it's an angel from heaven and he says hold on a second let's talk about this again just so you get it straight if anybody says anything contrary to what we've already taught you let him be accursed his will is his word brother random talks about this Centurion and uh I just want to check it I believe could be wrong I want to be sure yeah it's out of the message respects I don't know if anybody's listened to that but there's so many points in that message talking about God's word and to be able to respect God's word and you know brother Bradham he even says it if someone is wrong if someone is incorrect and you know they are just respect them anyways because that could be God working through that person and you know what happens in our lives brothers and sisters we get faced with so many trials do you think that any one of our trials is an accident any one of our trials is ordained and it just happens the the cosmics Collide and suddenly we've got this problem God knew it before the foundation of the world and he allowed that trial to happen in our lives he allows the trials that are going to happen in our lives so that he can show Who We Are the trials of our faith are precious they're more precious than the gold that we see in this world they're more precious than the cars we have than the houses we have than the bank accounts and Investments that we have out of this message respects Brother Brad I'm talking about this Centurion he says so we find one time that there was a Roman and he was a great man and he loved the Jews and he had a servant that was sick himself he didn't feel worthy to go ask Jesus see you always want to feel a lot littler than what you are he says don't never be big in your own sight see was this brother Bradham speaking here it was but what was the inspiration behind it brothers and sisters this isn't just some gimmick to try and psychologically make you feel better or make other people feel better it's not a psychological tactic to go and sell things or or gain favor in people's sight what this is is pleasing in the sight of the Lord he had a servant that was sick himself he didn't feel worthy to go and ask Jesus so you always want to feel a lot littler than what you are don't you never be a big man in your own sight see now and if you're big let somebody else say it about you but now I just want to stop here and say this you know brother brownie tells that story probably remember it where he had preached a service and and he went out back out outside of the church and he was shaking hands with the people and people came and said God bless you brother Bradham I really enjoyed that service and there was a man who was a minister he was standing there and he watched brother Bradham a few times receive the thank you for that service and what a wonderful thing it was and the minister came up to him after and he said you know God bless you brother I just don't agree with what you're receiving that that that thank you for those services and and brother Branham he I'm you're gonna have to listen to it for yourself but brother random he says to him you know there's there's a difference here between you and I and and that Minister said what's that the minister was saying that he shouldn't receive it I'm I'm totally mixing this up but what brother Branham he said was you know what there's one difference between you and me is that I'm honest about it I like it there's nothing wrong with getting a compliment and receiving a compliment but when we do brothers and sisters we need to make sure that we understand where that compliment ultimately rests and if we have any good gift in our lives it's only because God's given it to us it's not because we have done anything we've just simply allowed the Lord to manifest in our lives take a look at Daniel what did he do he applied the word in his life and God manifested greatly Joseph he applied the word in his life no matter what came his way and God manifested through him mightily never be big in your own sight see now I know somebody say you're big let somebody else say it about you see now when you were This Woman This Man rather he said he was a Roman Centurion and he had a sick servant so he sent to get his sixth servant healed and Jesus said I'll come heal him can you imagine that knowing that the prophet was in the land maybe it was brother Bradham with the great healing campaign you just send a note and say hey come and pray for my servant my servant's sick will you come and pray for him this was Jesus Christ and he said sure I'll come what a tremendous thing yeah so on his Road the Romans seen him coming it's Brother Brad I'm speaking I imagine he said oh my here comes the Holy One here comes that Holy One well I'm a non uh uh non-count Gentile I'm I'm a Roman Centurion I'm a general or an officer I really not a Jew I have no right for that holy man to come see the respects see I don't have no right to have that Holy servant of God come to my house and you know I just want to pause here too just to think about it there's only one that can receive that kind of accolade and that's God in flesh who is Jesus Christ we know there's a few examples in the Bible Joshua when he went out to meet that man he saw standing there with his sword he drew his sword and said who are you are you are you for us or are you against us and what did that man tell him he said loose the shoes off your feet because the ground you're standing on is Holy and and he worshiped him he understood he received that worship too but we know the two witnesses in in the two men in Revelations John the type of the Bride tried to worship those Angel Messengers and what did they say they said see thou do it not for I'm just a servant just like you don't don't try and worship me worship God so I just want to point out that the true servants always going to point to Christ always going to point to Christ so I'm coming down coming to the door and he called him said Lord I'm not worthy that you should come under my roof probably had a palace of a home a centurion said I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof and I I didn't think myself worthy to even come to you can you imagine that I sent a messenger because I didn't think that I could even come into your presence so I sent some some of your your own blessed people the Jews but I have a servant here that's very sick and he said I'm a man under Authority said I say to this Soldier you go and he goes and to this one you come and he comes what did he say there I know that you have all power you can say to this disease go and it goes and you can say to this one come and it would come see he recognized this just makes me think brothers and sisters we got to be so careful when we pray we were having a conversation a little while ago we can have Bulldog faith and say that God's word says that we should be healed and and by his stripes we're healed and we should be getting God to activate because we're actually declaring his word but what if God put a disease on someone for a purpose brother Branham talks about that we don't want to be saying God I want to change your will we we don't want to do that sometimes God will allow something to come on a person for a purpose so now we kind of go in in Full Circle and it could sound very nebulous brother Barry where you going with this is is there's only one way to pray as far as I can tell brothers and sisters and say not not my will but thy will let thy will be done in this situation Lord if you want this disease to be on a person then it's going to be on that person but if you don't want it there guess what's going to happen because you're a man of great Authority if you want that disease to come it'll come if you want that disease to go it'll go but that's kind of what I think causes such confusion today even in around the message of the hour is that we have a a I had a mental conception that maybe we should be able to just activate the faith of God and and get him to move on a situation and then we'll know that we believe but that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost as we read in the beginning here in in Matthew chapter seven not everyone that has many signs and wonders that can prophesy that can heal the sick maybe raise the dead go through all the many signs and wonders that's going to cause you to believe anymore no there's people that are going to try and get in there we know the other story that Jesus gives that there is a wedding a wedding happened and and everyone in the Oriental tradition is giving a wedding garment and they're invited into the wedding supper and while they're in there at the festive Festival he finds one without a garment on and he says friend how did you get in here brother Branham he says you know what he did he crawled around the backside through a denomination through the window he tried to get in his own way and we talked about that in the story of Noah already we can't come any other way because he is the door to the Sheepfold he is the great Shepherd and we know he also talks about it brother Bradham does it the shepherd what does the shepherd do he lays down in front of the door he doesn't just close the door and go back into his house again he lays down in front of the door and if anybody's going to get into that Sheepfold they're going to go through him they're not just getting it on their own but if we want to come to that wedding supper we've got to come with a wedding garment on the only way that we're going to make ourselves ready is to dress ourselves in his word we know that in Revelations 19 let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad let's be very glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come and what his wife hath made herself ready how does she make herself ready she puts on that wedding garment that wedding garment is the word of God in her life living out he goes on to say come come and it and it would come see he recognized as he had authority over these soldiers so Jesus had authority over all the sickness and diseases only thing you have to do Lord is just speak the word that's it just speak the word and my servant will live can you imagine that the people on that day must have thought he was a little crazy why would he be that way why would he be acting that way but somehow somewhere along the way God God gave him a revelation it wasn't something that a man gave him he had a revelation of who this this man Jesus was in his day just speak the word and that's it Jesus stopped turned around to them Jews and said I haven't found Faith like that over in Israel he said it's all right with your servant amen why because he respected it he respected Jesus Christ who was the god of Heaven I don't know how we can read quotes like this and come up with another identification for Jesus Christ I don't get it but you know what it was the respect that he had for Jesus and today brothers and sisters how does this apply to us today it's the respect that we have today for the Lord Jesus because this is the Lord Jesus right here brothers and sisters we'll get to that in a little bit I I hope but you know what the word of God is print form Jesus Christ in our day and if we're willing to accept print form word of Jesus Christ entirely then we're willing to accept Jesus Christ himself but if we're not willing to accept print form word of Jesus Christ in our day then guess what we're only accepting a part of Jesus Christ himself and that's the troubling part with the world I was no better until I was shown a further light and you know when I say that some people might say wow that's getting a little bit crazy now you're really stretching it brother and I know everyone here probably believes what I'm saying but you know what there is a further light and that furtherance of the light isn't a new word that furtherance of the light is an unfolding of the existing word and that's what makes our Prophet a prophet because he pointed to this word and he even said the same thing that Paul said hey if you can't take my word for it take his word for it if we would just listen to what he said if we would ever get the chance to hear that that's what he said if you can't take my word for it take what God Said for it the print form Jesus Christ in our day the ink on paper you know brother Adam he says this when we want to be healed why do we want to be healed I think it's so important brothers and sisters to recognize when we talk about speaking the word there has to be a purpose for the words that we speak whether it's simple conversation or or whether it is speaking the word of faith in our lives why do we speak a word what is it that we're doing you probably want to find this brother I'll oh sorry I boy I copy and paste and I forgot to bring it up there it's out of 65 I've heard but now I see I'll give you the paragraph even you have it 58 someone come not long ago a group of men some of them listening in tonight and told me said I kept telling them go to Kentucky oil's down there I knew it was I seen a vision kind of tremendous story here and it almost sounds like he contradicts himself but sometimes I think the word of God comes to us a certain way and we can either choose to accept it in that moment or just reject it and if we choose to accept it then you know what sometimes a great blessing can come our way and if we choose to reject it then we lose it we've lost it we can't go back to it someone come not long ago a group of men someone I'm listening in tonight and told me said I kept telling them go to Kentucky oil's down there I knew seen in a vision well brother Dimas and them didn't go for a long time after a while finally they said after Texas had moved in and they said now we're going down they saw other people had interest in it I said you ought to have went a long time ago but they didn't do it Dima said I made a great mistake by that in in that by by not doing that brother Bradham I said if you'd have went down there you'd have had it all I don't know if it's in here or further on but he talks about how much oil flowed from this from this uh well here well they wouldn't listen then the first then for we left that night the place where we were having lunch the Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth and then that was full of oil and these overflows in Kentucky was just little beds of oil that they were pumping from but this one come from the mainstream and I said brother Dimas it's there so they went to searching for it said go down and tell us where where the oil well is now he says oh no no no no no no see we don't use the gift of God for commercial no no he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him see if I'd had a need of it I believe I'd ask him and he'd tell me isn't that interesting it sounds like a total contradiction but here we have now these brothers are seeing that there's actually something to this and they're getting greedy over it now they want a clamor for this because they can see the dollar signs and the cash register ringing and see their stock counter going up and and on and on and on but now he backs away and says no no I told you I told you all I needed to and there's no doubt in my mind when you look at this story here by him telling them what they what he told them if they would have just gone to Kentucky they could have gone and sat down in a cafe and said well I wonder where we would need to go this is just me saying this this is just my view uh dramatizing it they could have gone anywhere and and I bet you somebody would have said something that would have triggered them to know exactly where to go to find this oil if they would have just listened to the prophet in in their day there but they didn't and so once they realized the greed started to rise up and then he said no I'm not you know what you had your chance you passed up now it's gone says I I believe if I'd asked him he'd tell me but see this is what I want to get to today brothers and sisters he says but first you see your motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask how many times do we ask according to the word of God or do we ask like in the Book of James so that we can consume it upon our the lusts of our flesh the things in this life that we we desire so greatly we maybe Pine away for a fancy new house or or or tremendous wardrobe of clothing or or maybe a a fancy new church building or or maybe a a really fine car what would it what is it that we're asking for but first your motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God and I can't help but think brothers and sisters as we read this as we talk today we we hear it's got to be in the will of God what's the will of God it's his word that's the will of God I've said this many times I told you I was perplexed over it for a long time but God made it so clear to me his will is his word it's got to be according to the will of God he goes on to say see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God many times we'll pray I was this way for many years Lord just show me your will show me your will if I could just know your will in the matter then I would be able to be okay I would I would know what is his will brothers and sisters it's his word of his word if we can actually take the word and apply it in every situation and make sure the thoughts that we're thinking the thoughts that come to us and run through our thinking they actually go through the mind of Christ we take every single thought into captivity not just into the pocket not just into a memory bank but into the word of God when a thought comes into our mind we've got to be running it through the mind of Christ that's why he said let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you because he knew the greatest battle ever fought is going to be in the mind you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and then when faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over see now we can talk about a few different examples than we did in the past one of them is is the squirrels he was out there squirrel hunting and there's no squirrels around and and he says he wanted to get Three Squirrels here's the voice and starts to have a conversation with seemingly nobody there was nobody around but he has this conversation and he has a conversation with god he says you want three squirrels okay however you say it that's how it'll be you say the word why would he do that because it doesn't sound like it's anything rational I I would say it this way brothers and sisters as far as I can tell is is so that sister Hattie Wright her sons could receive their salvation because if they were just sitting around talking about cherry cobbler or sitting around talking about the weather or how poor they were or how her sister had been sick for so many years or all the different problems in life maybe what was going on in the church or what wasn't going on in the church if they were just sitting around spreading spiritual viruses do you think God would have come on the scene but he gave him an occasion to say hey wait a second there's something greater going on now that this word is open to us and what happened she said the right thing is what the Holy Ghost said to her she said the right thing whatever you want you'll have and he even gave her the example you won a million dollars go for it just say the word and it's yours but what what triggered it brother Branham said the Holy Ghost said true brother Branham you said the right thing that's why I want to harp on this for a little bit brothers and sisters we got to be saying the right things we've been given examples for a purpose so that we'll say the right things if we say the wrong things we're just putting ourselves in neutral we're putting our gear shift lever into neutral and we can step on the gas pedal all we want we're going to blow our engine if we keep that up but boy oh boy if we can ever just get it into gear and let the RPMs go low and then slowly let out the clutch and slowly step on the gas pedal we're gonna go somewhere something's gonna happen he says and then when it's then's when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over see sister how do you write she said the right thing and and she asked for the right thing first she said the right thing which pleased the Holy Spirit right that ain't nothing but the truth but then after she did that she could ask whatever she wanted say whatever you want your sister's been sick and we've prayed for her for years we talked about that why did she want to be healed why would she want what was the motive and objective why wouldn't she want the money they were poor brother Bradham says it you're poor you've been poor your whole life you need money you could use it naturally speaking but she knew in her spirit she might not have consciously recognized it I personally believe she didn't consciously recognize it but but maybe we could have a conversation about that but I believe something spoke from the inside of the inside the only thing of Eternal value that that word that she spoke it triggered something because she was speaking the right way having the right words the Holy Spirit was pleased by it and said ask what you want but the holy spirit will never deny himself the Holy Spirit would never allow her to ask for a million dollars so that she could consume it on her lust and go buy a fancy car or a big fat house only the salvation of her sons only the only thing that would last for eternity right the salvation of her sons and we know that in that moment the ones that were snickering and jeering over in the corner they came and fell over the lap of their mama can you imagine that brothers and sisters as parents to be able to have that kind of that kind of word to speak over our family to speak over our children that we would know for sure that they would have salvation eternal life I want to say it here now brothers and sisters you have that power if you come according to the word because your motive and your objective is going to be right but if we're asking about temporal things and we don't get them don't be surprised now sometimes we can get sick in our bodies and not get healed according to this flesh you know what whether we live or we die we're christs but unless we go in the Rapture brothers and sisters we know that God has a time appointed for every single one of us where he's going to pull our flower he's going to pluck our flower from the bouquet and say it's time to come home you've reached Perfection you've reached your place that's the way it is we can't change that but that's why we need to know where we stand that we don't have a spiritual virus and if we have one you know how you'll know if you have one when you hear the word of God if it gets you upset if you hear the word of God and something says I don't know if I can receive it that way that's how you're going to know if you've got some kind of a virus going on your life and that's not to say that any one of us brothers and sisters I've been infected that's why I'm saying it I've been infected and someone would come and baby bring correction and I would get upset because I know they're right but it doesn't mean that it changes the word of God but what was the motive of this Centurion brothers and sisters he cared about his servant he wasn't looking at a dollar value and saying you know that slave's worth a lot a good one right he he's makes me a lot of money and I know I could rely on him no he he cared about him over in the Book of Luke I had it marked out but we're not going to go there today for time's sake if you read it the same story in the Book of Luke it says that he cared for him that's why he had the right motive you know out of one in a million 1965 paragraph 46. he says let me give you a shocking something see not all that says unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father his will is his word not asking about the things in this life not not asking about the temporal things but understanding that the word that we ask when we ask why are we asking it what's the purpose of it his will brothers and sisters is his word out of 65 the choosing of a bride paragraph 166. I'll just pause and let you get there paragraph 166 out of choosing of a bride notice just a minute a nun in the Catholic church that woman to become a nun and takes that last Veil she is absolutely sold out to that church she is soul body and spirit property of that church she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last Veil no mind over all no will of her own see out there that Satan makes them his bogus like the true she is just like the bride right she's veiled brother Branham talks about the world how the world is veiled with the Lost Veil and how how Eve in the Garden of Eden she was veiled by the word originally but here we have the veil over top of the nun she just gives her life entirely but we know here here we have brother random saying that that's the bogus but there is a true and the true is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's taking that word Veil and putting it over top of herself she has no mind of her own she can't have when she takes that last Veil no mind of her own no will of her own see out here that Satan makes them his bogus like the true I believe I could just keep talking about that on and on isn't that just a way of the world today brothers and sisters brother Bradham said in 1933 one of the Visions one of the things that's going to change the world forever is the right to vote where women stop wearing dresses and garments that pertain to a woman and they start wearing pants and going to work in the factories and we know that it turned into a revolution and it turned into a whole bunch of different things and I'm not here to slam the women I'm just here to say what the prophet of God said but but when when we start to have a mind of our own we get out of our position I'm not saying that a woman should be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen either that is not at all what I'm doing brothers and sisters I want to be very clear I want to say look at Ephesians chapter 5 and make sure the husbands are in their position and the wives are in their position and the children can look up to their parents in their position because you know what happens is when one person gets out of their position and the other person knows it they're going to say I don't know if I can have confidence in that person I'm gonna have to start running everything that they say to me to the filter of my own mind can you imagine that what happens to a marriage when that happens brothers and sisters what happens in a marriage in a church when that happens when a pastor starts running stuff through the filter of the of his own mind and giving it to the people you got to kind of run it through your own filter at that point and say well I don't know but what if what if everything that said is truth according to the word what what what if what the husband does is he lives a life so holy before the whole entire family that when he walks he's like the priest of the home that says holy holy holy art thou Lord God Almighty and then when the wife walks the children hear the same thing holy holy holy art thou oh Lord God Almighty what a tremendous home that would be but if we start to show a mixed signal brothers and sisters what's going to happen we're going to start to question and when that happens we're going to say no I need to be able to make decisions on my own you know what honey I know that you're the boss and everything like that but I just don't know about this decision this decision is getting me a little bit upset and when that happens if it happens once it's gonna rattle everyone's ability to follow because we know the husband is the one that's going to answer for the wife not the wife for the husband and we know that the children are looking up to the parents she takes that last Veil no mind of her own no will of her own see out here that Satan makes them his bogus like the true the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a difference it's not a theological mind it's it's not the Catholic Church mind it's not our own traditional teaching or culturalistic mind it's the Lord Jesus Christ the mind of Christ and how do we get that mind of Christ the only way we get that mind of Christ is to be truly baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of our sins and then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and outside of that we're looking at the bogus it's going to look exactly like the same thing it's just going to be one word off one word off we've heard it said so many times as Satan's kingdom the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a difference and we find today that the modern Church a modern World Church the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnanted to give birth to Sons now we change gears a little bit how are they pregnated it's by the word it's a spiritual word that happens brothers and sisters one of them a denominational birth is going to be give one of of day to to these days at the World Council of churches which will produce the world to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's pretty powerful right there but that's what's going to happen and how is that going to happen it's not because the the world is going to wander after the Beast and say I want to follow a monster no they're going to follow cunningly devised fables something other than the word of God it's going to be something so subtle that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible how could it be possible to be so subtle that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible it has to be 99 truth otherwise people are going to say no it's wrong it's so easy to see it's wrong I'm not going to harp on it today but trinitarian baptism is not according to the word of God so do you truly receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit baptized in trinitarian baptism or is it just an anointing because it's got to be the indwelling of Jesus Christ and when that happens brothers and sisters it's not something that we're just poking at and saying you know I I think it it looks good and and maybe it's worked for some people but I just can't live it you know what no one can ever live it but if you ever get that life of Jesus Christ that lives inside of you it changes you from the inside out you become a new creature in Christ Jesus that's not a cunningly devised word it's not a poem it's not something that a man came up with that is the word of God you become a new creature in Christ Jesus that's exactly the truth he says I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms the World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist that's why I can't believe anybody ever talking around the message of the hour about the vaccine being the mark of the beast or anything like that you hear the prophet of God what he says very clearly what the mark of the beast is if you reject the holy ghost in your life by just saying hey you know what I'm going to do it my way I'm not going to do it the way the word of God says the way the message of the hour says I'm just going to do it my way when you do that you reject the Holy Ghost it's that simple it's plain and simple maybe it's really too plain for some but I think it's coming to that place brothers and sisters we need to recognize it it's going to be so close it will deceive the very elected if it were possible what's going to happen if they come around and say hey if you believe any of this randomism then we're going to shut down your bank accounts you're not going to have a mortgage you're not going to have insurance for your cars you're not going to be able to work because your social insurance number won't work now you're going to be on the street as a bum are you going to reject it and say no I got to feed my family what if they say it to me and say no we you got to sign this paper that says that you'll accept same-sex marriages in your church and if you won't do that then you won't have a charitable organization anymore am I going to say oh you know what I'll just fudge that that's okay no one will ever know it'll be okay we'll keep the church open it'll keep going we've got to be able to make a stand somewhere along the way brothers and sisters we've got to be able to stand on the word of God and know that it's the truth for us and nobody will ever be able to take it away because remember we talked about it just like we saw with covid they shut it down right quick and we're not looking to be fanaticals to go out there and try and act like something's going on we're gonna live right right just the way that we're supposed to we're going to Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's but before that we're going to give God what's God's we're not going to let anybody tell us we can't give God what's God's but the random goes on to say in paragraph 170 the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride how does she do that brothers and sisters she accepts that word in its fullness she receives it oh my I just I get so many thoughts coming to me and it just it just yeah it gets me so excited the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth a body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that such a tremendous statement right there because that means there's still some more people that need to come in and it's not just finished this business of saying us for and no more you know that that's not correct because until the Rapture he's still calling they're still people that are given Grace there's the 11th Hour workers the story of it and we know there's some people that got their nose out of joint because they've worked their entire lives their whole careers maybe served for the master and the vineyard all those times and all those ways they did so much for the kingdom and the body oh my and somebody comes in off the street a little rat that comes in and gets saved and suddenly they're just going to get the same reward that these people that have labored all along and we know that Jesus said so so so what's wrong friend didn't I agree to give you a a eternal life was wasn't that what we agreed upon wasn't that good and we know that he equates it to a value of a dollar but sometimes people do that he said he that that would be the case I just think this is beautiful the other is pregnanted by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ we've said it so many times wasn't there supposed to be a finished body of Jesus Christ that descends from heaven with a shout with a voice and the Trump of God we had a prophet in our day that he said the first two have already happened so how could they happen if he hadn't already descended brothers and sisters and we know that we get into the mysterious discussion of Revelations 10 1-7 where he put one foot on land and one foot on the sea raised one hand onto heaven with open book in his hand and said there shall be time no more and what that is representing is that there's time no more he has come down he has opened the word he has revealed the entire word to us and now those people who accept it become pregnated by that word and what happens when they're pregnanted by that word they have a little drink of water when they're pregnant by that word brothers and sisters there's something that grows inside of them we know that it's that mind that was in Christ Jesus it starts to grow in the heart of the believer in the very soul of the believer the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one we've talked about this so many times in Ephesians chapter five husbands in their positions wives in their positions Ephesians chapter 6 the children in their position but right at that little tiny bit at the back end of the Ephesians chapter five he says I speak to you concerning a mystery a great mystery about Christ and his church the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes them one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word imagine if we experienced something with God where we had to say well I just don't know because you made a mistake over there and maybe you were misquoting stuff and maybe you're getting your own idea and maybe you're making yourself a little big in your own sight and now I just can't trust you God because the way things are the things that have happened in my life I just can't trust you according to your word your word is a little bit shaky to me now I'm saying what would happen we would say I've got to start thinking for myself I have to start the the reason in my own mind the critical thinking about God's word about everything that comes across the pulpit about everything that happens brothers and sisters when we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're just going to say Amen when we hear the word and you know what when we don't hear the word if we do hear an error with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're just going to say it's a pit and I'm just going to spit it out because I know most of that is truth we talked about it a while ago and somebody asked me for the quote brother Bradham says I would rather go to a church that preaches partial truth than not go to a church at all and I would go to that church and support them and potentially help change them until I actually had the opportunity to go to a church that preached the whole truth the business of staying home and not going to church I don't know just have to go with what the prophet said but you know what some people are going to get pregnant by that word brothers and sisters and that's really where we want to get to today some people truly are being pregnated by that word and that might sound a little coarse but you know what it's true it's true It Happened One Time spiritually didn't it Eve she was created in the image of God wasn't she because God created Adam and then he created both Adam and Eve male and female created he them and we know that they were two in one he hadn't split them apart yet that first operation had never been performed Eve was created to be pregnated by the word she wasn't created to be pregnated by man but we know when Satan got into the mix what happened that changed everything that was the fall of mankind she began to create on her own Adam and Eve began to be creators and that's why it's so important for us as parents to recognize we're creators we have the power of creation and I I was blown away when I heard that the first time but brothers and sisters it's true she was she was completely safe with Adam though wasn't she when she was in Adam Satan couldn't even get to her because if Satan came and tried to talk to Eve he would have to talk to her through Adam because Satan wouldn't be talking to Eve he'd be talking to Adam he'd be speaking to Adam because Eve was in him but when she became separated from him that's when it became treacherous isn't it because she began to reason she began to have her own critical thinking she began to think her own thoughts and when that happened Satan slipped in and got one word off one word off and caused the fall of mankind you know we could say whether it was an apple or an apricot whatever it was that spoken word that she heard it became a thought you know it was one word off you shall surely not die you can you can eat of every tree in here and you will certainly not die just one word not right and what happened that word impregnated her and it pregnated her spiritually because that word became a thought and that thought became expressed in her life right and because of that and we can say you know whether some people would say I'm just saying it this way for the people who might be tuning in some people would say maybe she had a a a relation act with that that serpent in the garden or or whether she ate an apricot we could go down a rabbit hole of discussion about that but let's just push that discussion aside for a second and just simply say it this way she disobeyed God's word if we disobey God's word we're going to get repercussions just like she did whether it's an apple or an apricot or whatever it was it was the word that was spoke to her that became a thought that she acted on that's why we've got to be so careful with the words that we speak and the thoughts that we take in when that thought became accepted in Eve it caused a pregnation before she became pregnant because she acted on it that word changed something inside of her she no longer said wow I just believe everything my husband says and I won't take one step out from what he says she took that reasoning from what her husband had given her as the word because we know that God came and he told Adam you can eat from any tree in the garden but just don't eat from that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right you can eat from the Tree of Life but don't touch that other one that other one's going to cause death he didn't come until Eve make sure Adam that you tell Eve that he told Adam that and she received the instruction from her husband but somewhere along the way the devil got in and caused her to just go one word off of what her husband's instructions were that's why brothers and sisters I'll tell you what for myself when I look at this the magnitude of this I hope it's coming across the way that I've been thinking about it and feeling about it the way the Lord's been reviewing it puts such a tremendous amount of responsibility on the husbands to make sure that we are truly living according to the word of God because if our wives are going to start doubting us and our wives are going to start reasoning on their own Brothers we're in trouble as long as Eve was in her husband she was totally safe but as soon as she stepped out and just began exploring the reasoning on her own that's when Satan got her and because she fell Adam fell because Adam knew that she was a part of him he couldn't let her go just like Christ couldn't let his bride go and isn't it wonderful brothers and sisters to recognize that as Adam stepped out and said I know as a Son of God I'm forfeiting all of my rights to eternal life but I love her so much I'm just gonna go right after her and I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure that I seal the deal and she's going to be my bride my wife I am not going to let anyone else pregnant her and he went with her and you know what Christ has done the same thing with us today brothers and sisters he's given us a word today to be pregnated by my goodness and you know what when that happens changes everything and we know that God wasn't surprised in Genesis 3 and 9 when he came down into the garden and said Adam Where Art Thou sometimes it's it's worded in such a way that God was wandering through the Garden of Eden the cool of the evening crying out Adam where are you you're lost I can't find you is God he knew exactly where he was and he was declaring to Adam do you know where you are Adam do you know where you've Fallen to Adam and he came and had the discussion with him and he explained it to him I just want to say this today brothers and sisters just get behind God's word don't don't don't don't start to reason God's word out in our own minds because we'll never be able to do it because his word says that his thoughts are not our thoughts and neither his ways our ways it's it's totally different than what we think that's why we're told to get the mind of Christ in us you know there was another one who actually got pregnant by the word we've heard this before I'm going to start speeding up for time's sake here but in Luke chapter one let's just turn here well we still have a few minutes Luke chapter one very very familiar scripture to start reading with verse 28. story of Mary and the angel Gabriel coming to visit her the angel came unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women I just I'll go on here sorry before I start talking and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and all of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and the angel departed from her we know that this is the key part of this Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word I just can't help but take this brothers and sisters and type it to the angel messenger of our day we have had an angel messenger come and say hail thou highly favored among women behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus you know the natural types of spiritual we've talked about this so many times we know it that's what we hear in the message of the hour if you do not accept the word of God for your day you're not going to get a spiritual conception in your spiritual womb brothers and sisters and what's it going to do it's not going to bring forth another man-child like Jesus Christ called Jesus Christ that's not what I'm saying I'm talking spiritually speaking we have got to get pregnated by the word of God and when we do the power of the highest the same holy ghost that visited Mary here actually Came Upon her and caused a birth to happen and what we're talking about today is that new birth brothers and sisters we've got to get that New Birth the only way we're going to get that New Birth is according to the word of God unless we get pregnated by some sort of other teaching some sort of denominational teaching if we do that then we're going to have a denominational birth brother Bradham says it very clearly we can have a new Baptist we can have Revenue Presbyterian we can have a new Pentecostal we can have a new non-denominational and we can go even farther and say we could have another message believer but do you believe the message of the hour do you have Christ of the message in your life if the power of the highest overshadows us brothers and sisters there is going to be a thing that shall be born inside of us we become new creatures in Christ Jesus then it's not going to be a physical birth it's going to be a new birth where we become a new creature in Christ Jesus but you know what had to happen before this we still have 10 minutes I think it's so beautiful in in this in this scripture here in Luke it's just so beautiful if you just flip a page back in Luke just to actually bring it forward to to to show how the natural types the spiritual where we're at today brothers and sisters in Luke 1 15 to 17. we're talking about how this had to happen first there had to be someone that came to prepare the way of the Lord first right for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wide nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost same holy ghost that happened to Mary there in the womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him and the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord what we're talking about here is this Elijah anointing and we know there's a five comings of the spirit of Elijah I'm not here to name them all I just want to get to one thing brothers and sisters this Elijah anointing is supposed to happen according to the word of God and what happened was this spiritual anointing came at the same time the New Birth was coming the same time the message of the hour happened to Mary the same thing was going on in parallel in her cousin but this one was born just a little bit sooner so that he could prepare the way of the Lord there has to be a preparation made for the Lord to come for that body to happen the Elijah anointing was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready of people prepared for the Lord and we know that that completely dovetails with Malachi 4 5 and 6. behold I will send you Elijah the prophet so I want to say brothers and sisters this is a this is a statement in the word of God that says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet so when is that going to happen when is Elijah the prophet gonna happen I know why it's completely silent because we know it's already happened Elijah the prophets already come he's already prepared the way of the Lord behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse we know this is a very familiar scripture but it's exactly in line with chapter with Luke here chapter one before Jesus could be born in the womb of Mary there had to be one come to prepare the way for that to happen and we know that she said amen to the angel and and that gave her the ability to receive the Holy Ghost it's got to be the same way for us that doesn't change the fact that there's still an Elijah anointing that has to come before we can receive this word the Elijah anointing is the one that presents it to us that prepares the way of the Lord that's what preparing the way of the Lord is is showing the word of God for our day brothers and sisters he's as immutable in his nature as he and it is in his ways he's not going to come and do something one way one day and do something totally different outside of his word the other way it's going to be exactly according to his word just like there has to be Apostolic fathers there has to be new birth children and and you know when we look at it in that light doesn't it make it so easy to say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I recognize my position it doesn't make it a belaboring song where we yawn oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you know the song leader singing that song again you know what the song Leader's got nothing to do with your worship here we go down a different direction he's got nothing to do with your worship and I would say this brothers and sisters the instruments got nothing to do with your worship if they're grating on your skin it's because God's allowing it to see what you're going to do about it are they going to stop you from praising what he's done for you is anybody going to get in the way of your relationship with God my goodness when we've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that new life that comes inside of us it changes us from the inside out we can't help it anymore he's not gonna say oh it was too fast oh don't worry you didn't worship me that day that's okay don't worry about it I I didn't want it anyways or it was too too slow or it was too loud or it was too soft or whatever it is brothers and sisters we've been given the ability to worship because we recognize what he's done for us when we recognize that it makes it so easy to worship when we recognize that his word says that if if we can believe then we and our families can be saved we just need to apply the token when the prophet in our day said if your children aren't serving God just keep applying the token just keep praying for them and they will be saved we've got every reason in the world to worship to recognize that we have the ability to hear this word of God for our day oh my goodness there has to be Apostolic fathers there has to be new birth children oh we were talking a little while ago about some people that that just were able to worship so freely and and how wonderful it is to get in that atmosphere when everyone is worshiping and no one cares about what's going on around you when that happens brothers and sisters it changes the atmosphere and you know what the prophet of God said that's where we're bound to hear from heaven and why do we gather together on a Sunday not to hear a brother preach not to just hear quotes I I strongly hope that that that with all of our hearts that we gather together to fellowship with the Lord to hear from our theophonies to change our bodies to give us the strength we need from day to day we have to be turned back to something and that's the faith of the Pentecostal fathers isn't that wonderful many times we can hear that and say well the the faith of the Pentecostal fathers is that Azusa Street no it's not no it's not that was a type of the Holy Ghost outpouring sure enough I won't deny that for a second but what we want to do is go right back to the Pentecostal experience back in the upper room where they came out they stumbled out like drunk people in the streets and Joel or Peter he stood up and said this is what the prophet Joel had to say this is that that they spoke about he told that this would happen I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers not a denominational Azusa Street but back to the upper room even though Mary gave natural birth to Jesus Christ remember brothers and sisters she had to go in that upper room also she had to have the new birth experience too we all have to have that experience and brother Bradham says it very clearly that if you've ever seen a birth it's messy if you've never had a new birth I want to recommend that you have one search until you get it ask the Lord Jesus Christ give me that new birth he'll give it to you if you want it but even though Mary gave birth naturally to the man Jesus she had to be there to receive her baptism just like all the rest of them just like all of us because the Spirit of Elijah came didn't he in that day and he said I I've come I'm the voice of one cried in the wilderness when they said who are you are you the prophet are you the Messiah who are you who are you I'm just one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and we know that our day we had a light come down over top of the Ohio River when he was baptizing was it his 17th person that day and what happened that that same Spirit came and spoke to him and said just as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so you and your ministry will forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and we read it earlier today brothers and sisters what is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a word coming of Jesus and when the word gets in the bride when she accepts that word and accepts it into her spiritual womb and starts to have a new birth experience we become that body of Jesus Christ here on Earth we begin to complete that body and you know there's still more to come I want to say it until he takes us away there's still more to come the ministry that says us for no more you know you know there's problems there just leave it alone still shake their hands and say God bless you still fellowship with them don't ever turn your back on anyone that's a doctrine of a devil to say that I've got to build a camp and we can't fellowship with them people over there because they don't Fellowship here that's a doctrine of a devil don't believe it for a second that's exactly what Satan wants you're giving Satan a day off when you do that even the people in denominations because brother Bradham he said it I would say God said it through brother Bradham that God has people in every denomination doesn't he so how could that be that we count fellowship with the Pentecostal people or or the fullness people or the Oneness people or the whoever people why can't we fellowship with every single person and talk about Jesus Christ because the prophet of God said it that when we talk about Jesus Christ what happens he comes on the sea we invite him on the scene because the spirit of Prophecy is when you speak Jesus Christ [Music] my goodness we've been given the ability to come back to this new birth experience I'll call the musicians as we start to close today brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us to receive the new birth and the only way we're going to get the new birth is by the word for our day and it's got to be the word that was delivered to the Saints through the messenger of the age and you know I just want to say it this way just take a look at what he said don't take Google's response for it because I would say this we all know this but for those people who are maybe questioning it and have have discussion about it is everything that you see on Google true that's one word answer not not an explanation or a discussion either yes or no is everything on Google true I'll just leave it with you because if it's not then then how can you just take that as your answer I think we've all experienced it enough we know that we need to investigate a little further when we want to know something and we've learned to take the law of averages we'll take the majority of what we see on Google but I want to say this brothers and sisters maybe stand with me as we close once again I got a whole bunch to say but you know what it's just so beautiful that woman that was at the well she didn't go in run into the City and say let's get the textbooks out and let's examine to see if this guy that is up there on the hill says that he is the Messiah let's examine it to see whether he's the one let's get everyone's popular opinion and determine whether this is the case or not she said come and see a man who told me the things that I've done she had an experience herself and that gave her the ability to offer that that that testimony of Christ because the testimony of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters is the spirit of Prophecy if you want to be prophetic testify Jesus Christ to this world speak the name of Jesus to the world around you and see if people don't respond let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word Lord thank you for the ability to hear what the spirit has to say to the church today Father we don't want a word for yesterday and we don't want a word for tomorrow we want the word for right now in this moment Lord Jesus and we know that you haven't left us high and dry you have not abandoned us father you would never leave us or forsake us that's your word Lord Jesus and we're so thankful that's your word father we pray that Lord you would help us to not look

pray that Lord your will would be done in every one of our Lives Lord whether we're here present right now whether we're streaming whether we we see this video later father Lord we know that you're

ask now that you would accept the fruit of our lips Lord the worship from our hearts that it could be in spirit and in truth Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you we ask that you would keep
