where the saints of God will be your Ass Like Home to me one more as we stand I sounds like oh to me oh like when to be do you hear your thoughts again [Music] and all the hills will let go with the story oh as we sing of his grace and His glory where the saints of God will be that sounds like home to me thinking of that little stanza there the hills will Echo with the story remember brother random song or is his his story he said when you hear me singing Amazing Grace a voice down in the valley he said Oh Brother Brad I made it I believe our songs will resonate through the Hills of Glory we'll be singing I will be I trust you will be maybe I love singing more than others but I just tend to think that worship will be part of our life all through eternity he's so worthy of it Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus where else would you want to turn let's let's turn to him tonight as we invite our pastor a couple more courses will too [Music] Jesus oh look for in his wonderful face and the things [Music] glory and grace one more time your eyes Upon Jesus Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] though these ships been battered aren't you thankful for that tonight oh yes the egg holds oh the lovely Lord Jesus [Music] I told [Music] it on my knees as I face Life's a raging Seas but the anchor holds in spite of this storm what a promise oh yes the anger home oh the ships been battered thank you foreign [Music] it's a pretty amazing promise to know that as the storm rages the anchor just goes deeper you know that story about how a tree gets stronger and taller it's because of the storm it's because of the wind causes the tree to stretch and lean and causes the roots to pull and stretch and be able to grow deeper and if we didn't have the storms in life we wouldn't be able to plant Our Roots deeper either it's part of the natural course that God has chosen for us in our day but we know that when the enemy comes in like a flood spirit of God raises a standard against it and we can see that in our individual lives and experience it in our individual circumstances but I think sometimes it's worth to just step back and look at the big picture and realize that the enemy has come in like a flood to this generation and God has raised a standard against it and that standard is the brothers and the sisters who receive the word for their day the ability to overcome and withstand Satan not by anything that they could ever do but simply by their testimony and the blood of the Lamb let's just go to him in prayer if anybody has a prayer request just make it known to him with an uplifted hand like to continue to remember brother Jonah the Saints in Kelowna for the John Drake is in need of a a lung transplant with covid in the hospital we just pray for the the Saints there and every other need tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we can call you father we're so thankful that we can call you Lord because your word says that the only way we could ever do that is by your Holy Ghost by your Holy Spirit living out through US Lord father tonight I pray that Lord if there's anything in our lives that would be displeasing unto you that you would just forgive us for it now Lord I pray that if there's anything in our lives that would clog up the channels Lord Jesus father that you would just Purge it from us now that you would just take away all sin and all iniquity in our lives Lord Jesus that we could just be washed out and and cleansed by the blood of the Lamb rather that we could come before your throne with boldness tonight Lord Jesus the way that you have instructed us to the way that we would want our children to come unto us to not be afraid to not have any guilt to not have any shame but to recognize that the only way you see us is the way that you created us and father tonight we just want to remember the prayer requests as we mention them Father firstly the uplifted hands everyone who has the need Lord Jesus you know the need behind the hand and we thank you Father that you already have a solution to that need before it was even mentioned by the raising of the hand father we pray for the Saints in Kelowna Lord Jesus our brothers and sisters who are affected by coved Lord Lord in the very specific situation a pastor who has been laid down in in a in a situation where he can't even be with those those people that need his support Lord Jesus to look at what Satan's trying to do to the situation but we know that he will not Prevail that he cannot Prevail that your word is the only thing that will prevail and father we just stand United with our brothers and our sisters in Kelowna tonight and we just ask that you would touch them all that you would heal them all that you would raise them back up again father Lord that our brother wouldn't need to have a lung transplant because the great physician has come by and already transplanted his lungs in the name of Jesus we ask it father we just love you and we thank you we pray that you would bless our little service here tonight Lord father we ask that I could just get out of the way and that you could come by here father and that you could speak to us Lord that you could speak through US father that you would give us ears to hear what the spirit has to say and Lord Jesus a heart to receive that word tonight father in its fullness we just love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen Hallelujah God bless you thank you musicians tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Hebrews chapter 10. Hebrews chapter 10. we'll just start reading with verse one in Hebrews chapter 10. I trust everyone's having a good week so far it's definitely been beautiful weather so nice to see it's one extreme to the other though in our climate we find that uh just when we start to get used to one temperature and one climate we start to climatize then it changes for us and it goes the other way in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the Commerce there unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight as we speak about the Natural Things father we just pray that you would reveal the spiritual father we pray that tonight we wouldn't be talking about the natural things and and dwelling upon natural circumstances but father that you would just take us into the heavenlies Lord that we could just see the spiritual word tonight father that you would speak to our our souls tonight father Lord Jesus that one more time your sheep would be fed Lord Jesus that you would be glorified in all that's said and done we want this service to be all about you tonight father even as we speak about the natural things pertaining to the weather Lord Jesus we know that it changes continually and we just can never really predict it but we're so thankful there's one thing that never changes Lord your word says that heavens and earth will pass away but your word will remain father help us to eat the book tonight Lord Jesus one more time we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just had this thought that I couldn't get rid of so I felt that it was the Lord once again leading so here we go the thought about a body hast thou prepared and we know that we're speaking in in Hebrews here Paul is talking about the contrast between law and Grace and how the law under the law according to Moses law offering the blood of bulls and goats would never do away with sin would never get rid of it entirely it never could because not one animal could ever be a Kinsmen Redeemer just uh I think it's amazing when we look at it to think that a body hast thou prepared me because if we look at ourselves we are that body for today we are the body that he has chosen today that person that is purged from sin that comes in one time because of the testimony of someone else the life that lives out through them when they die out to themselves and they become a new creature in Christ Jesus many times I think we can look at it and see it as as we become a new creature it's it's it's a it's a mixing of our our old self mostly dead and and this new desire to live in a Christian Realm but that's not it at all brothers and sisters becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus means that we literally are becoming the Lord Jesus Christ in our flesh we are not living according to a mixing of our old selves and a mixing of the desire to be the new person the new creature in Christ Jesus we literally have to die out to ourselves and we said it many many times brother Branham says it in invisible Union the old man has to die every single Speck of the old man has to die speaking tonight about a body a body hast thou prepared me many different ways we can look at the body we can look at the body as the general body the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ but I think tonight more than anything I'd like to talk about the individual body the individual Temple the individual being the body of Jesus Christ if we can go through our lives looking at ourselves that way that we are his choice we are his body when he came to Earth the first time he chose Adam to be his body Adam was God on Earth god Jehovah was God in heaven but Adam was God's choice to be God on Earth in in the Book of Genesis in the very beginning but Adam being in that God position didn't realize that when he tried to step into death he couldn't step back into life and what he found was he actually contravened the word of God and brought death to all mankind we know that the the Temptation came through the woman that Adam was not deceived that it actually was a willful act of Adam to follow his wife because he loved her but it was the ultimate plan of God a a display of his love for his bride in the final days throughout all the ages not just the final days but just to to have a body that he has prepared to look at our own lives and think how many things that we go through in our lives how many struggles how many faults and how many failures and Satan comes around and reminds us of all of those so very often and sometimes other people do it as well some people can't help themselves but you know what we need to do we need to look at the mirror of God's word and realize that we are his choice he chose us we didn't choose him many times it can feel like we chose him and that's when we start to get into works and and basically I would say a nicolaitan spirit can creep into our lives and maybe feel begin to feel like there's something that we can do there's a Works based gospel and and even around the truth of our day and there's nothing that we could ever do there's nothing we've ever done except for be able to recognize our weakness to recognize that we have nothing good about us except for a hybrid condition but he has prepared a body in you and in I he prepared a body in Jesus Christ he prepared a body in Adam you know we talked about it I can't even remember when it was it's amazing how how quickly time goes and and how yeah it's just amazing how things go but uh you know we spoke recently about how God chose man many different ways he chose to express himself many different ways to the children of Israel as they were coming out of Egypt and and he displayed himself to Believers throughout all the ages in men that's how he chooses to display himself and and me myself just marveling at this thought that God has has chosen a body a body hast thou prepared me every single one of us brothers and sisters are his body that he has prepared that he chose to dwell himself in you know we say it many times when we get over to the other side how how we're gonna say Noah how'd you do it Joshua how did you do it Moses what was it like all of the Believers but they're going to say no what about you you're the one that he chose to express himself through laodicea in a body hath he chosen a body hast thou he hast thou prepared me we get to be his body here on Earth and I'm sorry brothers and sisters I I know some people some people get offended if we're not wearing a tie or whatever but it's hot I have to take and open the sleeve and this is pretty hot you know what it doesn't matter because we have the word we can have church we can worship Him we know brother Paul said there's probably going to be something significant about being on the other side in worship and we know that brother Branham said that this is the quietest place we're ever going to be he says it multiple times you know when we get that full realization when we get that full understanding of what it means to be redeemed all of the angels that actually stepped outside of their natural state those ones that followed Lucifer There's No Redemption for them there's some people that were created for Destruction human beings there's other people that have the potential to be saved Maybe by doing something or or or helping the children of God somewhere along the way but then there's another group of people that was elected to succeed they were elected to be Sons and Daughters of God to get to that place in our minds where we can recognize that consciously understand that brothers and sisters there ain't nothing that's going to hold us back from shouting for Joy because we know it was never our choice it was his choice all along it's just it just baffles the mind to think about that and and what it's like to to realize that you know what every single one of us outside of his grace our souls are hanging over Hell by a chain a breaking chain a rusty chain a chain that's probably not going to be able to stand up to the heat very long but to realize that he has chosen to save us and raise us up as his body not just as a son and daughter of God not just as a human being on Earth that can understand the scripture and say bless God I'm saved I believe the prophet for my day but to believe that we truly are adopted Sons and Daughters of God the one that he has chosen to make his voice the one that he has chosen to live out through to work through is just tremendous so tremendous it actually makes me want to get into gymnastics when I start thinking about that because I feel like doing somersaults or cartwheels or backflips and shouting while I do it because I know where I come from you know brother Emmanuel said it it hasn't left me our message is our testimony I know what God's done for me and you know maybe I can't quote the scripture is really good and I I can't quote the quotes really good but I can tell you what God has done for me and nobody can change that let me tell you I am a new creature in Christ Jesus I'm not who I want to be but I'm certainly not who I used to be goodness sakes oh my could introduce you to people that would say what what happened to this guy where did he go how how did this happen how could this possibly be out of last uh last Wednesday I read this quote and I just wanted to start out by reading this tonight and we haven't had a Time Warp tonight I'm thankful for that we've got a little bit of time um then unconsciously your faith is there brothers and sisters this is what I really want to try and encourage continually over and over and try and remind and try and just I guess encourages the best word that unconsciously your faith is there you don't have to worry about whether you've got faith enough to do this as Sons and Daughters of God when we're adopted Sons and Daughters of God this is speaking about adopted Sons and Daughters of God in 1955 even before the seals were opened he's he's a prophet prophesying about adopted Sons and Daughters of God the ones that truly are the body that's been prepared those people the ones that actually don't even have to try and drum anything up they don't have to worry when the winds are blowing and the ship is being tossed about like a bottle stopper where the disciples the ones with him get so upset because they think they're going to perish because they know that all the devils are surrounding them but they can just simply speak the word because they know that they're adopted they know that they've been given the checkbook and they've got the money in the bank to back that check when they write it unconsciously your faith is there you don't have to worry about whether you got faith enough to do this or faith enough to do that it's just there anyhow it's just there you just do it because the father said so and it's the Living Word in you and God's in you manifesting himself just like he was in Christ I just want to pause there and and say don't don't look at works don't say well where's Mark 16 in action I didn't raise anybody from the dead recently and uh you know I've got this problem financially and it just continually drags around with me and uh you know this other thing is going on and uh you know I I prayed about it and God hasn't moved and uh all these different things you know what that is that's Satan trying to get you worked up in the situation and distract you from what's really happening because what's really happening if you are a true son and daughter of God the true baptism of the holy spirit gives you the ability to say Amen to the word when it comes that's the true evidence of the Holy Spirit not because you've been able to live in an Apostolic age and act like one of the Apostles where you can you can raise the dead and and cast out demons and all of that stuff remember when the 70 came back to Jesus and they were so excited because they they've been out doing the major campaign going across the country and doing all those things those Great Mighty works of God and what did Jesus say to them don't Rejoice because you're doing that that doesn't matter Rejoice because your names are written in heaven that's why you need to rejoice and you know brothers and sisters if we don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives we actually potentially are receiving the mark of the beast and I don't mean to make it sound in such a way that I I paused as I said that because it almost sounds frightening I'm not trying to scare I'm just trying to say what's the truth if we reject the Holy Spirit we receive the mark of the beast that's what happens in our day we don't want to do that but just to look at this this quote here he was and and it's the Living Word in you and God's in you manifesting himself just like he was in Christ he says you say as he was in Christ yes sir he said the works that I do shall you also and it's interesting to to think about it because you know how in Matthew 4 Matthew 4 The Works that Jesus did he cast out Satan from his midst right the tempter came to him and said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread show us a sign and we'll believe right what did Jesus do he used the word he used the word but he answered and said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and how does a man live on that word how does a man eat that word by hearing the word by reading the word by saying Amen to that word you know I I felt this I've we have all heard it said that when you say Amen it's it's like Sikkim to a dog when you say that when someone's preaching but I I I I just had this thought I don't know maybe somebody said it and I just can't remember who or or what or where but I just believe this too brothers and sisters when you say Amen what you do is you smack all of the Demons around you that are tempting you trying to torment you all of them get a punch in the face every one of them when you say Amen to the word it does something it doesn't just go idle when you say Amen to the word and you don't have to shout it or or scream it or jump up and and run to the front of the church and and act like that it's not like that when there's something in your heart that says Amen to the word be it unto me according to Thy word that's what Jesus is looking for that's the works that brother Branham is talking about here you know Jesus saith unto him it's it's written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God then Jesus said unto him get thee and Satan for it's written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve all of those are scriptures that were written before the word using the word same thing for us today brothers and sisters we the body that's been prepared by the word using the word he says it's the Living Word in you not the Living Word in me the prophet not the Living Word in your pastor not the Living Word in a in a deacon or a trustee or an evangelist or an apostle or a teacher not the Living Word in them it's the Living Word in you and God's in you manifesting himself just like he was in Christ the ability to speak the word the ability to receive the word that's all not Mighty works not not wonders you say as he was in Christ yes sir he said the works that I do shall you also even more than this for I go to my father now that's his word Saint John 14 12 he gave the promise everyone will believe that was inspired and so a little while the world see me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you until the end of the age of the Apostles no I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and he says Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to think that that's that's who we're looking for I believe that through the through the mighty signs the the polls that we've seen in the in the life of the prophet has almost set something in Motion in in the message to create an idea that unless we see the mighty works that the prophet was doing in his life actively working in our lives that maybe we just aren't quite there we just haven't achieved it yet we might not have actually been fully adopted yet brothers and sisters the evidence of the Holy Ghost in our lives he said it the prophet said it I'm not going to read the quote I'll say look it up he said the true evidence of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives is the ability to receive the word the ability to receive the word not say that I've I've I've I've seen all these Mighty Works in my life I don't even know why I'm talking like this tonight it's so bizarre it's completely off the notes but hey a body has he prepared and you know brothers and sisters that body is you and I I've said it and I'll just keep saying it tonight it's you it's I it's everyone that receives the word in our day and to receive the word in our day we don't just receive the word according to a Catholic and and receives the word according to a denominational Church a Pentecostal or a Baptist or a Methodist we don't do that you can't receive the word according to that because what's Jesus going to judge the World by when he comes back a church and if it is which one isn't there 44 000 different denominations of Christian churches in the world today it's it's very close to that forty four thousand so which one of those is he going to judge the World by we know that brother Branham says that's not what he's going to judge the World by he's going to judge the World by Christ which is the word and you know what if we have the word in us we have Christ in US and at that point brothers and sisters we become that body that's been prepared we become that body and you know the beautiful part is and that's what I was saying when it gets into adoption when we come to that place of realization of adoption being fully adopted in our Our Lives to be fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God we realize that that body he has prepared we haven't prepared it but when we recognize that we are the dwelling place of the most high the temple built without hands my goodness then we want to do things to sanctify it to to actually fortify it to actually prepare it so that he will actually manifest in it and through it you know we can look at the church building and we have the springtime cleanups and imagine if we did that in our lives where we just had one time a year where we just tidied up our lives and and made it good but you know as a Christian we do it every single day not just once a week not just twice a week or or once or twice a month or even once every six months or once a year we would be dead if we did that we have to feed on the word every single day of Our Lives we have to make sure that that body is looked after and not not not by the way cardinality would look at it how how we can go and lift weights and exercise and and eat so good and eat all the the vitamins and the minerals and I'm so thankful that we had a pastor that would just say you know what we need to have that kind of Faith the faith that we're talking about right here that we could go and eat at McDonald's one of the junkiest places that that would ever produce food on the open market and ask the Lord to bless it and be able to get all of the nutrients that we would get out of that meal if we needed it because the Lord blessed our food when we spoke it wasn't us speaking it was him speaking that's why it's so important to be able to pray out of the Statue of a perfect man now this is where we start to get good but the statue of a perfect man now God or the Bible said here that Stephen spoke of Solomon building a temple and the most high don't dwell in temples made with hands for Heavens my Throne Earth is my footstool and where is the place of my rest isn't this beautiful but a body hast thou prepared me Brother Brad I'm speaking here he says amen there you are amen there you are a body hast thou prepared me God dwells in the Statue of a man and I'll say and a woman reflecting himself into that being perfect worship thinking about worship talking about worship tonight perfect worship it's not just singing songs perfect worship is in perfect harmony with one another giving him the ability to reflect himself through us reflecting himself into that being he says perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting oh how we could stay on that see it almost suffocate in here from Heat I didn't actually yeah that's interesting I didn't put this together like this because of the Heat oh my thinking about this though the body hast thou prepared me and there you are it's interesting to look at it and realize that we are his choice even if we don't want to be we still are his choice remember the story brother Brown told about that minister that Minister he decided he was done with it he just threw in the towel he's going to go and get a case of beer he drove a crowd drove across town went and got the box of beer I was going to go and drink it and God took him home God didn't let him go through with it brother Branham said for a purpose because he is one of his own he wouldn't let him go too far many times we we have our own will but God's will be done God's will will always be done going on in the Statue of a perfect man talking about this body talking about God's choice of a place to dwell now that is the house God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on top of it and a high steeple sea but a body hast thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in I just love how it brings he brings this down really close to home he makes it so we can understand it he makes it so that we can comprehend it we can understand it it's not out there and and nebulous and and and and nicolaitan it's about every single one of us having the ability to recognize that we're that body he says a body thou Hast prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentally of God so I was I was interested in this and I looked up the word instrumentally and and it basically just goes back to instrument but to look at it from that perspective to think that really that's what we are an instrument we're the instrument and God is the musician the Holy Spirit living out through US reflecting himself through Us in how we walk in how we talk being a place that he can dwell in working through living instrumentally of God when he says go we go when he says come we come when he says stop we stop we don't live our lives according to our own will brother Bradham says it we've all heard it a a a Christian life eternal life is not living for ourselves not living according to our own will but living for others he goes on to say living instrumentally for God God walking on two feet in you God walking in two feet in you for ye are written Epistles red of all men and the life that's in Christ and if the life that's in Christ be in you you'll bear the life that Christ bore how often did he get upset how often did he get fussed at situations how often did he argue how often did he have contention with people did he poke at people the only ones that he really did were the ones that acted to be the most religious really right it was the people that were the most undesirable were the ones that he was interested in the ones that had the ability to receive the word I just love how he says it though the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of God God walking in you for ye are written Epistles red of all men and if the life that's in Christ being you you'll bear the life Christ bore but brothers and sisters I just want to underline that tonight don't look for signs and wonders to say that that's the life that Christ bore look for the stature of the perfect man and what's the top of that is charity is love because God is love but you know what there's all of the parts below that and all of them add up to it all of the virtues that we need to see in our life it's not about signs and wonders it's not about having a great healing campaign or even a Revival we know the Revival is over this this ministry that we're dealing with that we're living walking and talking about is is a Ministry to the total lost it's interesting because when brother Bradham Drew out the uh the the seven Church ages remember he drew it out on the Blackboard he drew it with a little bit of light just a teeny little sliver of light is what he said in the laodicean age he said the Holy Ghost came along and actually drew that one Vindicated what he drew but drew the last one with no light imagine that the prophet on Earth throwing himself in the breach showing just a little teeny sliver of light meaning that there was just a group of people a tiny little group of people the ones that God has chosen to be his body walking on Earth again you know the the temple the original Temple that was given in the instructions to Moses just one part of that I want to talk about tonight and that's that's God gave him the instructions to to build the temple we know they're very ex very very explicit very very very detailed instructions on how to build it the size to build it the materials to use the people to gather all of the things to build this Temple but one of the components that he chose was a badger skin I think we've all heard it said many times in the past that it's no accident that he chose to use a badger skin and one of the reasons is because it's a very very strong skin very strong and I can only imagine there was a lot of badgers around in the day it was probably a relatively easy creature to get their hands on it wasn't a very nice one though it wasn't a very nice creature the badger the European Badger or the honey badger the one that was likely the one that was over there which still is is a very mean Creature if you try and Corner that thing it has a temper on it many people will not even approach them but uh you know it's no accident that God chose that to be what he made his Temple out of to think about how that actually can compare to the human being in in attitude sometimes people if they get cornered in situations they don't like even if they're wrong they still will actually turn mean and and and maybe not act just like a Christian ought to but it doesn't change what's on the inside of them it's the outside it's the badger skin it's that genetic makeup that we all deal with that code from the hybrid creature that we are that genetic code that we deal with but it doesn't change what's on the inside tonight what we're talking about is what's on the inside a body hast thou prepared me we have been made to be bodies walking around here we've been made to be bodies that come together as the many membered body for his Spirit to be in one mind in one Accord but you know I just can't help but think that this little animal was a bit of a a bit of a reflection of the human nature the nature that can be in humans very very tough and very very alley but you know that's God's choice I can look at myself outside of a new birth and say that I probably was that way not probably I was that way just a little stinky badger something with a snarly attitude and uh probably not good for much but that's human beings in general when we get the new birth we become the new creature in Christ Jesus like we've said you know it's uh it's interesting to see God's choice and it can be real easy to stumble at the Veil and many times I know I've been guilty of it to look at people and think could that really be how could that possibly be but we don't ever want to be judging anyone by their skin we don't ever want to judge a book by its cover because we don't know about the story that's inside that book and every single human being has a story that they have had to write that's our lives we don't have a choice about that but to think about how God when we can look back on our lives and see how God has allowed us to come certain ways it it it's it's so humbling to look at it let's turn over to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 15. I'm just going to read a little scripture here tonight to just talk about sort of the contrast about this body and how how we can actually see it and I think it's neat to to see how the word identifies the natural sometimes we can read about the spiritual and talk about the spiritual and and it just becomes all spiritual but God did it in such a way that we could actually it shows us that he's conscious of the natural as well by the way this is written let's start reading with verse 35 in First Corinthians chapter 15. but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die what Paul is talking about here is about having the new birth when you put a seed in the ground the only way that seed is actually going to come to life is if it completely dies and rots away and he's talking about the new birth and he's upgrading the Corinthians here just before this and I didn't really want to get into that but I just want to explain that part of it as we go into the rest of it here thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die you have to have a new birth and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or some other grain but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the Stars for one star diareth from another star in glory think about how many stars are there out there verse 42 so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not the first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the Earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly when we receive the Holy Spirit In Our Lives brothers and sisters becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus the word itself begins to reflect out of us we're not rejoicing because we're having great healing campaigns and because we cast out devils and raise the dead and heal the sick and and the blind sea and all of that we're not looking for that we're looking for the one thing the one true evidence of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives to show that the Lord is in US verse 47 the first man is of the earth Earthly the second man that's the one we're talking about tonight the second man is what is the Lord From Heaven and where is the Lord From Heaven tonight where is he tonight brothers and sisters verse 48 as is the Earthly such are they also that are earthy and ah and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are heavenly you know I just can't help but say just let's flip over to Romans chapter 8 just for fun we still have a few minutes tonight we haven't run out of time it doesn't get any finer than this Romans chapter 8. verse 1. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus but I would say there is therefore now no condemnation to them which have Christ Jesus in them who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're not we're walking after the fleshy things in this world we are the body that he has chosen in verse 2 for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh the blood of bulls and goats God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in who in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace rest that Eighth Day the understanding that he's got it all under control we don't understand many things that happen in our lives but we know that he's got it all under control and we know that everything that happens to us is for a purpose it's so that he can work out his glory through our lives verse 7 because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God we don't want to be in the flesh brothers and sisters says right here that we can't please God when we're in the flesh and you know really it can be easy to to just look at it and say maybe I'm getting fleshy by saying such and such about someone or whatever whatever but I don't think that that's really what the the true meaning to the laodicean age about this is brothers and sisters to get in the flesh is to deny the word of God to deny one portion of the word of God Eve denied one word in the Garden of Eden for us to deny one word today for us to interpret the message of the Prophet the Vindicated Prophet for our day for us to interpret it and say well I know he said it that way but I can do it this way we can just do most of it but we'll just do a little bit of whatever if we try and do that brothers and sisters that's what he's talking about here that's the message for us in our day the carnal mind is enmity against God science is going to be esteemed higher than the word of God in my life I'm going to say what a doctor says before I take the word of God brothers and sisters that's being carnally minded we don't want to be carnally minded we need to speak the word of God we need to cast out devils in the name of Jesus Christ they might not move just because we say it but you know what they have to go there comes a point in time where they have to go the carnal mind is enmity against God and you know what we might have a situation in our life that unfolds in such a way that it's just contrary to the way we think that it should because the devil should go but God will allow things to happen in ways that he allows things to happen and we can't question that we can only go on and say you know what my testimony is stronger than the situation and and that's the way it is but to be carnally minded is enmity against God for it is not subjects of the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God I just love this verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and what does he mean by Quicken your mortal bodies he means that you'll have eternal life will be quickened to the word firstly and that's where we begin to walk after the spirit where the carnal man dies and we begin to have a testimony that we're a new creature in Christ Jesus and then the battle starts when we get saved when you get the Holy Ghost in your life it's not a flowery bed of ease It's Not Easy Street that's when the battle starts that's when the Devils come around and start to tempt and try but you know what when we actually aren't carnally minded when that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in US it quickens our mortal bodies to the word because we know that will never die it doesn't matter what comes our way doesn't matter if God chooses to take us home doesn't matter whatever happens is for our good because the spirit of him lives out through us in the unveiling of God brother Branham says behind the old temple in the Veil what was back behind there what was Jehovah what was hit back there what was the veil hiding oh hallelujah what was the veil hiding it was hiding the word he doesn't say it was hiding the pillar of fire he doesn't say it was hiding the Shekinah Glory doesn't say you mean he does after I think but he doesn't say that it was hiding anything else he just says it was hiding the word Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee Thy word is a light a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path it's it's the word brothers and sisters it's the only thing that can save us he says what was hit back there what was the veil hiding oh hallelujah what was the veil hiding it was hiding the word the veil all Badger skins was hiding the word to their eyes natural behind there also was the show bread see the bread of life that we've been talking about it was the showbread see behind there also was the Shekinah Glory but it was hid from all of them it was all hid all the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin that's right all the fullness of God dwelling in a son and a daughter all right I just want to read that scripture now I just have to bear with me for a second I just it's stuck with me and I just can't get rid of it brothers and sisters if you turn over to Ephesians chapter 3. talking about what brother Branham is saying here the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin that's right I'll head to the Natural Eye it is today too he says it is today too all the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin and it is today too in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 16. that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man right that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height you might be able to understand it we would have the comprehension of what this means to have God living in US verse 19 is the is sort of the the punch line and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God not just abortion not just a little bit not just a a tiny little sprinkle of it but all the fullness of God right there behind the badger skin brothers and sisters huh can you imagine that if we could look at each other and realize yeah look at that old Badger over there remember all the glory of God potentially dwells right there behind that Badger skin I just believe this could help maybe the way we deal with one another maybe the way we deal with our children maybe the way we deal with our parents maybe the way we deal with our spouses maybe the way we deal with our deacons I don't know but if we look at one another in a different way that you know what potentially all of the glory of God is right behind that Badger skin that's God's choice all the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin that's right he says I'll head to the Natural Eye it is today too it's called a bunch of Holy Rollers fanatics but they don't know what's hid behind he says that's right they don't know see then when God in Mercy rent The Veil for them to see because he did right when Jesus was on the cross it was the very first place that he went to when he gave up the ghost isn't it he went right into the temple right to the temple to rent the veil for them to see he says they were so wrapped up in their traditions that it was still hit to them even to this day same now he says out of the unveiling of God the glory the power of the Holy Spirit the Shekinah Glory that comes upon the believer now I mean the real believer he says in Brackets that causes the works of God and the faith to come into him to believe the word of God that's all hid to them eyes they say them things are past you see they're still living behind the veil you're not behind that Veil anymore little ones God's come into full view of you it's just glorious this this just I don't know just excites me it's going to read a little more here as we come to the end out of the unveiling of God he says the Shekinah Glory manifests him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out to you that's the reason that he had to Veil Moses face because in him was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah like we've talked about how he would Veil himself in a human being and come and express himself to the world a body hast thou prepared me he it just I don't even know if I'm expressing this right even but it's just short circuits my brain to think how much of a condescension it must have been for God to manifest himself in a human being I think I'm saying that right it just I can't even really get my head wrapped around that I don't know if it's just me or not but like we just we're humans and and you know how I guess we have to look at it that way you know when brother Bradham was talking to his friend there and his I think it was Charlie Cox saying you know whether it be hunting in Heaven Can Can we hunt squirrels in heaven and brother Branham compares the hog nature and you know would you ever want to go back to being a hog if you ever became a human being and no we certainly wouldn't and I guess it's it's like that I guess I'm just babbling now but it's just bizarre to think that how far did he condescend to trick Satan it's so amazing and brothers and sisters it has to be the same thing today he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a body he has prepared today brothers and sisters and we're talking to it right now those people who receive the word those people who receive a prophet in the name of a prophet they receive the prophet's reward we go on to Glory we are the ones that he actually presents to Jesus when he gets judged amazing to think about that story that we read back a little while ago crossing the beyond the curtain of time is the message yeah amazing to think about he says he had to fail Moses face because he hid because in him was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah I just can't get beyond that because I keep thinking about it how he just veils himself in people throughout the ages all of the different men we could talk about tonight all of the different women that we could talk about tonight that he veiled himself in every one of them he chose to Veil himself in so that that word could continually come down further and further and further and further throughout all of the ages so that it could come to us tonight brothers and sisters so that we could be able to comprehend with All Saints oh my Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah and he fails himself today in Earthen vessels with the Shekinah the outside looks like a bunch of holy rulers old Badger skins you can look it up in uh the unveiling of God he says it so many times um yeah it's amazing but the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers old Badger skins but the inside hides the Shekinah Glory and it ripens the showbread that we Feast on you know just talking about that we could take a whole service about that talking about the bread of life it ripens the show bread what is he talking about that brothers and sisters he's talking about adding word cell upon word cell keeping that bread alive that bread being stored in the holy of holies and the holiest of holies inside our souls that word which we hide in our heart that we might not sin against him we are preserving that showbread we have eaten that bread every time we read the word we Feast on that bread and we preserve that bread in our lives every time we listen to a message we Feast on that bread and we preserve that bread in our lives there was a time where that bread was only given out by the priest and people didn't have the ability to do that when the nicolaitan spirit wrote that Antichrist Spirit there's another time where they could only go out and just collect enough just for one day and then if they took any more and preserved it it would just go rotten the showbread for us today brothers and sisters it's kind of the same thing if we don't actually feed it if we don't water it if we don't preserve it in our lives by by continually abiding in it then it will go rotten in our lives it ripens the shoe bread he says that we Feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles see it's the believer's food it's only for believers remember the showbread was only for the believer only see showbread seed notice what does it do that Shekinah Glory over the shoe bread kept it from spoiling kept it from spoiling I'll just call it musicians as we wrap up tonight it kept the showbread from spoiling remember the manna that came from heaven it was stayed in the Shekinah Glory from one generation to another outside it it got wiggle tails in it overnight it contaminated is that right outside of the Shekinah Glory the days of Miracles has passed see it's all fanaticism but inside talking about the inside stand with me tonight as we as we close I just want to go back to the original quote that I read tonight trust there isn't too many quotes out of the fundamental foundation for faith brother Branham says then unconsciously your faith is there why is your faith there brothers and sisters because you know who is on the inside you might not feel it but remember brother Branham said that Holy Ghost is without sensation true baptism of the holy spirit is your ability to receive the word for your day not just receive the word and say I can say Amen to the word but to actually take the word and eat it just like John did he was instructed to take the book and eat it and he did and it was sweet as honey in his mouth the words just roll off our tongues but once it gets right down on the inside of these Badger skins it becomes trouble inside doesn't it because the old man starts to die but the new man starts to live and the more we feed the more the old man dies and the more the new man lives and the more we do that cycle greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world my goodness he says then unconsciously your faith is there you don't have to worry about whether you've got faith enough to do this or faith enough to do that it's just there anyhow you just do it because the father said so speak the word why cry speak just speak and go forwards know that you're truly an adopted son and daughter of God if you've met the requirements then he will meet every single one of his promises in our lives so long as we're willing to come according to his word that's all don't listen to Satan don't think about Satan when he comes around and says you did this or you didn't do that all the stuff that Satan tries to do remember God only sees you the way that he created you he only hears your voice that's all he doesn't listen to the accuser of the Brethren very soon soon and very soon we're going to see the king and when we do brothers and sisters Satan is completely cast out and he no longer has a voice but you know what when he comes and tries to accuse us God says you know what that one that actually came that I tricked you with that one that Holy one that was born in that woman that one was a kinsman redeemer and that one paid the price once and for all for every single one of my children and there isn't one of them that I'll lose and it doesn't matter what you try and tell me about that person you know how it is when you love someone someone could come and try and tell you anything about them and you'll say I don't care what you say to me about that person I don't want to hear it I don't want to hear it don't even talk to me close your mouth go away imagine that's what God does for us you've got nothing to say Satan I paid the price and you know it it's finished they're saved they're my adopted Sons and Daughters of God but we just bypassed our theophonies and we haven't experienced that realm in our consciousness so we don't really understand that we just have to believe it by faith and that's the faith brother Branham is talking about here that Faith it's just unconscious your faith is there you don't have to worry about whether you've got faith enough to do this think about a person that gets laid up in a hospital bed maybe they have amnesia maybe they have some terrible disease where they forget everything about them and all the people around them all of the stuff in their life is gone but then you start to sing a gospel song around them and they just start to sing the song something just starts to happen in their life because you can't change what's on the inside of a person this flesh has to fail whether we go to the sky or the grave this flesh it's going to perish then unconsciously your faith is there you don't have to worry about whether you've got faith enough to do this or faith enough to do that it's just there anyhow you just do it because the father said so and it's the Living Word in you it's not the Living Word in Calgary Living Word assembly it's the Living Word in every one of us that's what makes this The Living Word Assembly of God it's us it's him living out through us the Shekinah Glory behind the badger skin The Living Word in you and God's in you manifesting himself just like he was in Christ you say he as he was in Christ that's a pretty heavy statement as he was in Christ Prophet for our day says yes yes sir he said the works that I do shall you do also even more than this for I go to my father we've said it many times but you know it's possible to be a nuisance to the devil so that he doesn't even know what to do with us we could be so hidden Christ that he can't even find us he can't change our testimony brother Branham talks about it you can throw them up and throw them down you can get them sick I believe it's in the Statue of a perfect man maybe it's in the adoption series it's in the adoption series for sure it is he says the tutor having a good tutor goes to the father and says you know that son I've I've I've seen him get beat up I've seen him up and down I've seen his wife against him I've seen the church against him I've seen friends against him I've seen him sick I've seen him well I've seen all these different things up and down and all around and he just doesn't change his testimony he just keeps praising you this is the report the Tudor gives to the father brothers and sisters what's the father gonna say that's my son that's my daughter that's who exactly who I created them to be that's what we want the report to be back to the father from our tutor and we know that Tudor is the Holy Ghost we don't want him going back with the report saying you know he's almost got the word most of it he believes most of it but every once in a while there's one or two situations that come around and he just doesn't really speak the word to that situation yet what's gonna happen brothers and sisters that situation is going to keep coming back to us it's going to keep returning to us until we actually pass the test and it's going to be the word test and I'm saying I'm speaking to me here right now I've got my own tests brothers and sisters let me tell you but you know what I know that I'll prevail because he said I would just like he said that he loved me let's just bow and prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father tonight I pray that the words that were spoken would just be encouragement to your children father Lord I pray that you would just bless the words that were spoken to our spiritual nourishment tonight father that Lord as we go forwards we would not look at what the accuser says but we would look to what you say father that we would just start to have that faith that unconscious Faith live out through us in our lives Lord Jesus that while the situations come our way that we just won't be shaken because we know that you have everything under control Lord Jesus we just love you and we thank you tonight we thank you for an undefiled word Lord Jesus that was passed down through all of the generations Lord for for your word to make it 2 000 years through how many different hands of men how many different voices of men how many different pens of men for us to be able to be here today to comprehend it Lord father we thank you for sending us a prophet Lord that you could speak to us through according to your word your word says that you will speak to men through a prophet and father we're so thankful that you've given us the ability to receive a prophet we pray Lord Jesus that you would just bless the word that was spoken that you would go with us as we go our separate ways If It Be Your Will for us to meet again on Sunday Lord that you would just feed us abundantly one more time father we pray for brother murphin as he prepares for service on Sunday night we pray Lord Jesus that the lockdown would just unlock father that we could just come back together again in the in the new month and just have church again that we could assemble ourselves according to your word Lord Jesus and worship you the way that you desire to be worshiped father that we would just be the representation in Calgary that that that your Prophet Drew out on the Blackboard that little sliver of light in Calgary in this corner of the world Lord Jesus that we would be that representation of praise for you today Father how we love you and we thank you and we just bless your name we pray that you would just be glorified now in a couple of songs as we close the service as we go our separate way we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name tonight amen amen thank you Dwelling Place Hallelujah I
