[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] Amen. God bless each one of you once
[0:03] again this this evening. Welcome to you
[0:05] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus.
[0:07] Good to have each one out tonight. Good
[0:09] to be back in another Wednesday night
[0:11] service. Always a blessing. Probably
[0:14] repeat that many times, but it is a
[0:16] blessing to me. I'm sure it is to you as
[0:17] well. Let's sing this this evening.
[0:19] Let's start the service with the windows
[0:20] of heaven are open. Just a confession to
[0:23] the Lord that we believe he's going to
[0:25] feed us tonight.
[0:27] Oh, the windows of heaven are open.
[0:34] The blessings are falling tonight.
[0:39] Oh, there's joy, joy,
[0:43] joy in my heart, for Jesus makes
[0:48] everything right.
[0:51] Oh, I gave him my old tattered gar
[0:57] and he gave me a robe of pure white
[1:03] and I'm feasting today on me.
[1:09] Oh, and that's why I'm happy tonight. Oh
[1:14] yes, the windows of heaven are open.
[1:21] Oh, the blessings are falling tonight.

[1:32] for Jesus made everything right.

[1:42] garments
[1:44] and he gave me a roll of pure life.

[5:19] heads in prayer.
[5:21] Our father God in heaven, maker of
[5:24] heaven and earth, the God of Abraham,
[5:27] Isaac, and Jacob. Father Lord, we thank
[5:30] you Lord for all that you have done for
[5:33] us. But Lord, not only what you've done
[5:36] for us, but Lord, for who you are.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are alpha and omega, the
[5:41] beginning and the end, the first and the
[5:43] last. Lord, you are the author and
[5:44] finisher of our faith.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; And Lord, because of that, we are here
[5:48] today to show you how much you mean to
[5:51] us.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord. Father Lord,
[5:55] thank you
[5:57] &gt;&gt; for deeming us worthy to be called your
[5:59] children, to be called your own in this
[6:02] sinful and adulterous generation that
[6:05] has forsaken you. Lord, you have you
[6:08] have shielded us in that little sliver
[6:10] of life that your prophet revealed to
[6:12] us.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have helped us to see your
[6:15] word plain as day.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we we lift up our hands in
[6:21] worship to you, Father. Lord,
[6:23] &gt;&gt; we thank you Lord
[6:26] &gt;&gt; that you have not looked at us through
[6:28] our sins but you have looked at us
[6:30] through your blood
[6:33] &gt;&gt; and you have shown us to be redeemed.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Lord as we are here in this service to
[6:39] to give you just our little bit of
[6:42] sacrifice. Lord may you bless
[6:44] &gt;&gt; bless the song service. May you bless
[6:47] the musicians. May you bless the song
[6:49] leader. Lord, may you bless the minister
[6:51] that will be ministering to us today.
[6:53] Father, Lord, may may each soul here
[6:57] have have ripe ground so that your word
[7:01] can find the bedding ground and
[7:03] germinates and grow up into us
[7:06] &gt;&gt; into life eternal.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Be with us today, Father. Lord, bless
[7:11] us, Lord. And Lord, at the end of this
[7:13] service, may we not forget to give you
[7:15] all the praise, honor, and glory for
[7:17] what you would do for us today, Lord.
[7:20] Thank you father lord in Jesus name we
[7:23] pray with thanksgiving.

[7:38] vessel to vessel. We gain virtue from
[7:40] each other. Just even a prayer like
[7:42] that. Just thank the Lord for brothers
[7:44] and sisters that stand with you. This
[7:47] song is an old old song. Each step I
[7:49] take, there's a piece. Sorry. Uh, is
[7:52] that right?
[7:54] Sorry, we have that in reverse. Uh, I've

[8:26] he leads the way.
[8:30] And with each breath
[8:34] I whisper, I adore thee.
[8:40] Oh, what joy
[8:42] to walk with him each day.
[8:48] Each step I take,
[8:51] I know that he will guide me
[8:56] to higher ground.
[9:00] He ever leads me on
[9:05] until someday
[9:08] that last step will be taken.
[9:13] Each step I take
[9:16] just leads me closer home. Third verse,
[9:19] brother. Oh, I trust in God
[9:24] no matter what may.
[9:29] For life eternal
[9:34] is in his hands.

[9:41] that opens up the way.
[9:46] Oh, that will lead
[9:49] me to that promised land.

[9:57] I know that he will guide me
[10:03] to higher ground.

[10:22] just
[10:25] [Music]

[10:34] that the world never gave.

[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a need tonight, maybe
[24:25] just defy gravity and make it known unto
[24:28] him.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; As we go to him in prayer.
[24:34] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[24:36] tonight we're so thankful that we can
[24:38] gather together in your name.
[24:41] Lord, we know that this world is full of
[24:44] hatred. This world is full of sin.
[24:49] This world is not our home. Lord Jesus,
[24:53] we're so thankful that you have shown us
[24:55] our origin. Lord,
[24:57] &gt;&gt; amen.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Because of that, we know that it doesn't
[25:01] matter what happens here.
[25:04] It doesn't matter how it happens here
[25:07] because you created us in you before the
[25:10] foundation of the world, Lord,
[25:12] &gt;&gt; to be that seed
[25:15] planted in the proper place that at the
[25:18] proper time appointed of the father that
[25:21] that light of the sen would shine upon
[25:24] it and cause it to come to life.
[25:27] And father, we stand here tonight as
[25:30] witnesses
[25:32] of that life. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; That very life,
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Tonight, we just want to
[25:38] glorify you.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for all that
[25:43] you've done for us in our lives. And
[25:45] Lord, all that you're going to do, but
[25:47] Lord,
[25:48] &gt;&gt; we want to turn our attention to what
[25:50] you're doing right now.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you gave us a
[25:55] direction, a clear directive through
[25:57] your vindicated prophet to pay attention
[26:00] to what you're doing right now. Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; And help us, Lord Jesus, to observe this
[26:06] service. Help us to observe your spirit.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to have hearts to
[26:12] receive from you tonight, Lord.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Father, as we step into the highest
[26:16] order of the service, Lord, where you
[26:19] speak to us, we just invite you, Lord,
[26:22] &gt;&gt; to minister to our hearts, Lord. The
[26:24] speaker and hearer alike, Father, we all
[26:26] need you.
[26:28] If there's anything in our lives that
[26:29] would hinder that, Father, we just ask
[26:31] you would forgive it for from us, Lord.
[26:34] That you would forgive us for it, Lord.
[26:35] That you would purge it from us, Lord.
[26:38] Father, that your word would have its
[26:40] preeminence tonight in our midst.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to remember the
[26:46] requests that were made known unto you
[26:48] tonight by the way of an uplift hand.
[26:50] Lord,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We know that you're more
[26:53] than able, Lord, to discern the need and
[26:55] to be able to meet the need, Father. And
[26:57] we thank you for that. Tonight, Lord,
[27:00] also we just want to remember the Kirk
[27:02] family in the United States.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[27:05] &gt;&gt; we know that happened when your prophet
[27:08] was in the land and he said, "It's not
[27:09] right for a man to have to die that
[27:11] way."
[27:13] And Father, we just want to pray that
[27:15] you would be with them tonight, Lord.
[27:19] Lord, we love you and we thank you. We
[27:21] just ask now that you would bless the
[27:23] reading of your word, Father, that you
[27:24] would break it open to us fresh once
[27:26] again. Lord, we thank you for all that
[27:29] you're doing for us even now. In Jesus
[27:33] Christ's name we pray.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians, one more
[27:38] time for your dedicated service to the
[27:42] house of the Lord.
[27:44] And thank you, Sister Epha and brother
[27:46] Toby for that special.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; My God is real. Amen.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[27:53] I'd like to read out of 2 Kings chapter
[27:55] 13.
[27:57] And uh tonight I'm going to talk about
[28:00] what we did in the States for the the
[28:04] purpose I went there. Second Kings
[28:07] chapter 13. We'll start with verse 14.
[28:11] I think it's just just such a powerful
[28:13] scripture here and to know that it's the
[28:16] prophet speaking to the king and he's
[28:19] given an instruction but he just he just
[28:22] doesn't have a revelation about that
[28:24] instruction.
[28:27] 2 Kings 13:14
[28:30] the prophet Elisha.
[28:33] Now Elisha was fallen sick of his
[28:35] sickness whereof he died.
[28:38] And Joash the king of Israel came down
[28:40] unto him and wept over his face and
[28:44] said,"Oh my father, my father, the
[28:46] chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[28:48] thereof." We know that's exactly what
[28:51] the prophet said as his prophet was
[28:55] taken off the scene.
[28:57] Verse 15 says, "And Elisha said unto
[28:59] him, take the bow and arrows." And he
[29:02] took unto him the bow and arrows. And he
[29:06] said unto the king of Israel, "Put thine
[29:08] hand upon the bow." And he put his hand
[29:12] upon it. And Elisha put his hands upon
[29:15] the king's hands.
[29:18] Wouldn't it be nice to just have a
[29:19] vindicated prophet put his hands on
[29:21] yours? Oh my.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Open the window eastward."
[29:26] And he opened it. Then Elisha Elisha
[29:29] said, "Shoot." And he shot. And he said,
[29:33] "The arrow of the Lord's deliverance,
[29:36] and the arrow of the deliverance from
[29:38] Syria,
[29:40] for thou shalt smite the Syrians in
[29:42] Aphic till they have consumed them."
[29:45] Right?
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Till thou have consumed them.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "And he said, take the
[29:51] arrows, and he took them, and he said
[29:55] unto the king of Israel, smite upon the
[29:58] ground." And he smoked thrice and
[30:01] stayed. And the man of God was wroth
[30:04] with him and said, "Thou should have
[30:07] shouldest have smitten five or six
[30:10] times.
[30:12] Then hast thou smitten
[30:14] Syria till thou hast consumed it.
[30:18] Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but
[30:22] thrice."
[30:24] And Elisha died, and they buried him.
[30:27] and the bands of the Moabites invaded
[30:30] the land at the coming in of the year.
[30:34] Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[30:37] Father, thank you for your word. Thank
[30:39] you for your prophet.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the anointing, Lord, on
[30:43] your prophet, knowing that it's the same
[30:45] anointing on different humans, Lord, to
[30:49] bring the same word. You are the same
[30:52] yesterday, today, and forever. And we
[30:53] thank you for that anointing, Lord. It's
[30:55] just it's just as anointed tonight as it
[30:58] was there.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to commit the
[31:00] reading of your word into your hands
[31:03] now.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus
[31:06] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[31:09] seated.
[31:12] I'm sure that uh
[31:15] everyone is aware, but we'll just
[31:16] mention it quick here before we get
[31:18] going. And uh it's such a wonderful
[31:21] thing. We're going to have a tremendous
[31:23] weekend. This weekend we have brother
[31:25] Andrew Glover here. He comes in tomorrow
[31:28] and uh we have him here Friday at 7:30
[31:31] p.m. Saturday at 6 pm and Sunday at
[31:34] 10:00 a.m. Last year we had two services
[31:36] and it just wasn't enough. So we uh
[31:40] we're going to try three this year. And
[31:43] uh I'm certainly excited as well because
[31:45] it's later in the year. It's not during
[31:47] the summer when everyone has their trips
[31:48] planned and are away. So, we've tried to
[31:51] accommodate that as well as best we can.
[31:54] And uh we have a breakfast planned for
[31:56] Saturday at 10:00 a.m. We have the note
[31:58] out on the chat. If you desire to come,
[32:00] please just uh let us know. Potlook on
[32:03] Sunday. Again, there's a note on the
[32:05] chat. And uh I think that's about it. I
[32:09] just wanted to uh bring greetings from
[32:12] brother Ray Ericson at True Word
[32:14] Tabernacle. He is the pastor of that
[32:17] church and uh he's the senior pastor of
[32:20] that church I should say and brother
[32:22] Wayne Lawson is the pastor of that
[32:24] church and it's a real interesting thing
[32:27] they work together they together equal
[32:31] the pastor of the church and uh what a
[32:35] tremendous thing it would be to have
[32:36] that uh that person to be able to lean
[32:39] upon for uh wisdom and knowledge
[32:42] experience in dealing with matters
[32:45] Um, but they all send their greetings to
[32:48] Calgary Living Word.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; And my parting words with Brother Wayne
[32:52] were, "When are you coming to Calgary?"
[32:56] And so, we're talking about it and we'll
[32:59] see when it will happen. It looks like
[33:01] it'll be in the springtime potentially
[33:03] and uh it'll be a wonderful time of
[33:05] fellowship, I'm sure. For those who
[33:07] don't know why I went, I I went I was
[33:09] invited by him to come down and uh and
[33:13] speak at a men's meeting. They had a a
[33:16] bow shoot on Saturday
[33:19] and they put on uh a supper. One of the
[33:22] brothers does this in the church. It's
[33:24] not even the church that does it. I
[33:25] think the church probably helps them a
[33:26] bit, but um one of the brothers just had
[33:28] the desire in his heart to get the men
[33:30] together and just potentially bring in
[33:32] some ministry. And so he uh he was
[33:35] telling me that the Lord put it on his
[33:37] heart to do this. And uh he said, "You
[33:39] know what? Better way to do it than to
[33:41] bait them in with some food." So he put
[33:44] together a good meal. And 19 years ago,
[33:46] he started it. And he's been doing it
[33:48] every year for 19 years. And uh so they
[33:52] invited me to come. I don't know why,
[33:54] but they did. And uh you know, I think
[33:57] the Lord was good. I guess that's the
[33:59] reason why I just don't feel worthy. I
[34:01] know there's so many other ministries
[34:02] ministers that can really preach this
[34:05] gospel better than I can. But you know
[34:08] uh that evening uh Friday evening there
[34:11] was one one man came to the Lord in that
[34:14] meeting
[34:15] &gt;&gt; and there was five others that
[34:17] rededicated their lives to the Lord in
[34:19] that meeting
[34:21] &gt;&gt; and uh so I guess that's why and then
[34:24] the the following Sunday that was Friday
[34:26] night Sunday morning the one guy that
[34:28] gave his life to the Lord he said I want
[34:30] to be baptized right away and so he got
[34:32] baptized as well. There was two actual
[34:35] baptisms and both of those brothers were
[34:37] there. One of them gave his life back to
[34:38] the Lord and the other one actually uh
[34:41] found the Lord there. So just tremendous
[34:43] to to be a part of it. Um
[34:47] yeah, the Lord is good. It was just a
[34:50] real blessing to go and spend time with
[34:52] brother Wayne. I guess if I had to say
[34:54] it, he would probably be the the hory
[34:57] head for me in the ministry. He's just
[34:59] been a real good friend to me and you
[35:02] know I couldn't think of a better person
[35:03] that's based in the word to actually
[35:05] lean on for you know situations
[35:08] questions and uh you know to be able to
[35:11] learn this word. So uh they send their
[35:13] greetings and uh it just was a wonderful
[35:15] time of fellowship down there and
[35:18] refreshing to get away with my wife
[35:20] without the kids. We love the kids, but
[35:22] sometimes the marriage needs a break.
[35:25] And it's important to actually get away
[35:28] and just remember one another that
[35:31] you're married.
[35:33] Are you happy tonight?
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Certainly happy to be back home again.
[35:37] It's nice to get away, but it's even
[35:38] nicer to come home.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be together with the
[35:42] the saints in the in the church and uh
[35:45] just to get into the word. You know, I
[35:48] talked about this on uh on the Friday
[35:50] evening. I had a different direction for
[35:52] the Sunday service and it just I I
[35:55] believe when I got asked a question uh a
[35:58] message came to my heart and I had never
[36:00] listened to it before but I was sure
[36:02] that there was a message uh because of
[36:04] just how profound it came to me and it
[36:07] was called the arrow of God's
[36:08] deliverance.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. the arrow of God's deliverance.
[36:12] And uh
[36:15] the arrow of God's deliverance shot from
[36:16] a bow actually to be specific in 1956.
[36:20] And uh you know I can see that I did it
[36:23] again. Just bear with me for a second
[36:25] here. I've got some quotes that I want
[36:27] to bring. And uh I think it's important
[36:30] to make sure that we are on the same
[36:33] page.
[36:34] Um
[36:36] I apologize. I just sent them just so
[36:39] we're together tonight.
[36:41] I uh want to talk about this scripture
[36:43] here in 2 Kings chapter 14. I have read
[36:46] it in the past and uh always kind of
[36:48] wondered about it. You know, how how the
[36:51] the prophet, you know, one of the things
[36:53] I think is interesting how the prophet
[36:55] got sick and he died and uh how the king
[36:58] came around and said the same thing that
[37:01] uh you know, the prophet had said. He
[37:03] was able to repeat the prophet, but he
[37:05] wasn't able to live the prophet. And I'm
[37:08] not saying pattern himself to be the
[37:10] prophet and get a belt buckle and a
[37:13] suitcase and all of the memorabilia
[37:15] around what the prophet did to try and
[37:17] buy a mantle to look like the prophet.
[37:19] I'm not saying that at all. What I am
[37:21] saying is he had the desire to actually
[37:23] say the same words that the prophet
[37:25] said, but he didn't want to live it.
[37:27] This was a backsliden king, this Joash.
[37:30] And uh he wasn't actually in the will of
[37:33] the Lord for his life because he came in
[37:36] to be the king and he still kept some of
[37:37] the high places. He wasn't willing to
[37:39] tear them all down. And for whatever the
[37:42] reason, maybe he needed a little bit of
[37:43] notoriety or maybe he just didn't want
[37:46] to upset people. Whatever the reason, he
[37:48] actually kept some of the high places
[37:49] and that wasn't good enough to actually
[37:52] measure up to the message for his day.
[37:56] But you know, the prophet, he he was
[37:58] dying. He knew he was going and he did
[38:00] the best he could to try and give
[38:03] deliverance to the children of Israel in
[38:06] the moment that he had before he did
[38:08] cross over. And and we know the story.
[38:10] He told them to open the window, to take
[38:12] the bow, to draw the bow, and actually
[38:14] shoot eastward. And we know there's a a
[38:17] significance to the direction. I'm not
[38:18] really going to get too far into that
[38:20] tonight, but the fact is he was given
[38:22] the instruction. And you know in in
[38:24] verse 17 he said open the window
[38:27] eastward and he opened it. Then Elisha
[38:29] said shoot and he shot and he said the
[38:32] arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the
[38:35] arrow of the deliverance from Syria for
[38:37] thou shalt smite the Syrians and Aph
[38:39] till they have till thou hath consumed
[38:43] them.
[38:45] And we know verse 18 and 19 is really
[38:47] what I want to get into tonight in this
[38:49] message. um God's arrow of deliverance
[38:53] shot from a bow. Brother Brham, he
[38:55] really tends to dwell on these next two
[38:58] verses, verse 18 and verse 19. And uh
[39:02] you know, verse 18 says, "And he said,
[39:04] take the arrows." And he took them. And
[39:07] he said unto the king of Israel, smite
[39:08] upon the ground. And he smoked thrice
[39:10] and stayed.
[39:12] And we know this is the instruction of
[39:14] the prophet. Take the arrows and smite.
[39:16] Do it. And he did it.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[39:21] But the thing about it is he didn't do
[39:22] it by revelation,
[39:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:26] &gt;&gt; It wasn't quickened to him by
[39:28] revelation, by the spirit. Now, some
[39:30] might say while the spirit was gone, but
[39:32] he was dealing with the prophet of God,
[39:34] and there was an anointing on that man,
[39:37] which there wasn't on any other man.
[39:39] There was only one man that had that
[39:41] anointing. And this anointing was
[39:43] instructing him to do something, but he
[39:46] didn't do it by revelation. And the man
[39:48] of God, verse 19, was wroth with him.
[39:51] And he said, "Thou should have smitten
[39:53] five or six times. Then thou had smitten
[39:57] Syria till thou hast consumed it.
[39:59] Whereas now, thou shalt smite Syria but
[40:02] thrice." And when we were studying this,
[40:05] I was studying this. I was having a
[40:06] conversation about it and it came up.
[40:09] How would he know to smite the ground
[40:11] more than three times?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; He told them to smite until your enemy
[40:16] is consumed. So when is that? I think
[40:19] it's a lot like the day of Pentecost.
[40:21] They were given the instruction to go
[40:22] into the upper room until
[40:26] not 3 days, not six days,
[40:29] &gt;&gt; not six weeks. Just go in and and tar
[40:32] together in one mind and one accord. Go
[40:35] and get all the humanity out of your
[40:36] life until you receive power from on
[40:41] high.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gets into this and
[40:44] we'll just uh I'm going to read a bunch
[40:45] of quotes tonight. Right? I hope it's
[40:47] okay. I think there's nothing better
[40:49] that we could do really. We could come
[40:51] up with our own words, but uh it's just
[40:53] beautiful the way the prophet says it.
[40:55] You know, he talks about this and says
[40:56] that God always keeps his word. He says,
[40:58] "Now, you know, no matter how mysterious
[41:00] it seems, God always keeps his word. And
[41:04] no matter how unreasonable it may seem
[41:06] to the people, God keeps his word."
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And I think that that's such a beautiful
[41:11] thing. It's so amazing when we look at
[41:13] it that way because we can look at
[41:15] circumstances and situations and say,
[41:17] "Well, you know, God could do this for
[41:19] me and and maybe he should do that for
[41:21] me." But he always keeps his word.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; He's bound to his word. Not our thoughts
[41:25] and not our ideas, not our desires, not
[41:28] our wants.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes maybe what we even would
[41:32] consider to be our needs are not what he
[41:34] would consider our needs to be because
[41:37] we live in a leodyian condition. And
[41:40] sometimes being caught up in this
[41:41] leodysian condition, our needs are not
[41:45] actually our needs.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; They become wants.
[41:50] And if God makes a promise of anything,
[41:53] God will keep that promise. And I I just
[41:55] think it's so beautiful. You can see
[41:57] where I'm going with this. And it's not
[41:58] the way that I preached it there. I I
[42:00] waited and sort of built to a crescendo.
[42:02] But tonight, I just want to do it this
[42:03] way. I want to say it as we talk about
[42:05] this. We need to know that we have been
[42:08] given the liberty through the revelation
[42:10] in the day in which we live through the
[42:12] same anointing to smite our enemies.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Not just smite them thrice. Not just
[42:19] say, "Bang, bang, bang, I've done it.
[42:20] Now I can go home." No, no, no, no.
[42:23] Until our enemies are consumed.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Take the arrow of God's deliverance,
[42:29] which is this message of the hour, and
[42:31] smite until the enemy is done. Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; And when is that going to happen?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; I don't think that there is a day or an
[42:40] hour that any man can say, is there?
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Because really, what's going to happen
[42:44] is the enemy won't know what to do with
[42:45] us, but we're still going to be
[42:47] fighting.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; We're still going to be battling.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; You know, we can either be in a
[42:51] situation where we're like that crow.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells that story about
[42:55] that farmer that caught the crow and he
[42:56] put the string around him and all of his
[42:58] mates would come and they would talk and
[43:00] fellowship and they would fly away and
[43:02] he'd be stuck. He couldn't go. He'd jump
[43:04] and come back down. And one day that
[43:06] crow got loose, right? The string was
[43:08] cut and he didn't recognize that he was
[43:10] cut and his friends would come and
[43:13] they'd fly away and he wouldn't even
[43:14] bother trying anymore. He gave up
[43:17] because he was bound at one point. We
[43:18] can either live in that condition or we
[43:21] can live in the condition where we
[43:23] continually smite the enemy. Even if the
[43:25] enemy is done with us, we still need to
[43:28] fight.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; And we will until we actually have a
[43:31] body change.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham says,
[43:33] "You and I will make a promise and we'll
[43:35] break it because we don't mean to have
[43:37] to do it that way. But sometimes
[43:39] circumstances causes us to do it. We
[43:42] will break our promises."
[43:45] You know, he says sometimes it's it's
[43:46] ridiculous the way that he would go
[43:48] around about to keep his promise, but
[43:51] God always does it. I think if we can
[43:54] just remember that God always keeps his
[43:56] word. He always keeps his promise. Even
[43:59] though we actually will not, we cannot
[44:03] because we're humans,
[44:05] &gt;&gt; we will always break our promise. And
[44:07] the worst thing is, the worst thing is,
[44:09] this is what the devil will try and hang
[44:11] on us is we'll break our promise to God.
[44:12] We'll say, "Oh Lord, I'll never do that
[44:14] again if you'll just help me and if I
[44:16] could just never do that again." And
[44:17] guess what? We find ourselves doing it
[44:20] again. You want to find a rock and crawl
[44:22] under it and try and hide because what?
[44:24] How could we ever? That's where we
[44:26] actually become disgusted with
[44:28] ourselves. How could we ever do that?
[44:31] But you know, the Lord knew. He's never
[44:34] been surprised about us. Not one time in
[44:36] our life has he ever been surprised
[44:38] about anything we've ever done
[44:41] &gt;&gt; because he's God.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who we would be and how
[44:44] we would act.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; But he still put his seed inside of us.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And that is the mystery. The greatest
[44:51] mystery on this earth today is that
[44:53] Christ would actually be inside of human
[44:56] beings again. Are you serious? The devil
[44:59] can't believe that. That's why he
[45:00] continually comes after us.
[45:03] But you know Moses, brother Brandham in
[45:04] this message, he talks about Moses.
[45:06] Moses, he says, I think of Moses and how
[45:08] that Moses standing up there on the
[45:11] mount by the side of this burning bush.
[45:14] He had lost all hopes of freedom. He'd
[45:18] lost all hope of freedom in that in that
[45:20] spot he was in. He was at the top. He
[45:23] was with Pharaoh. He he was in control.
[45:26] He was educated. He had money. He didn't
[45:28] have any needs or wants in his life.
[45:31] Although he probably did, but he he he
[45:33] anything he wanted, he could have. And
[45:35] then he found out that he was actually
[45:37] not cut from the same cloth. And what
[45:40] did he do? He went and murdered someone
[45:41] because he saw his brothers and sisters
[45:43] being mistreated. And what did he do
[45:45] from there? He ran away. He was on the
[45:47] back side of the desert having that
[45:48] backside of the desert experience.
[45:49] Brother Brandham says he had 40 years in
[45:52] Egypt getting all polished up and
[45:54] scholarly king-like ready to take over
[45:56] the Pharaoh's throne. And then he went
[45:59] to the backside of the desert for 40
[46:01] years to get all of that learning out of
[46:02] him.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; And it was there in his 80s that he met
[46:07] this burning bush.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; He met this burning bush. And he says,
[46:11] "I think that Moses standing up there on
[46:13] the the mount on the side of this
[46:14] burning bush, he'd lost all hopes of
[46:16] freedom. But yet something inside of him
[46:18] was attracted to that burning bush. In
[46:21] some places, brother Brad Brownham says,
[46:22] many people probably saw that bush and
[46:24] thought, "Whatever. It's a bush on fire.
[46:26] Got sheep to deal with. We got problems.
[46:28] We've got situations. Let's carry on."
[46:30] But something inside of Moses said, "No,
[46:32] no, no. I'm going to turn aside and see
[46:33] what this is all about." It's the same
[46:36] thing for a believer today. If you've
[46:38] turned and looked at this message,
[46:39] there's something inside of you that's
[46:41] caused that. It's not just something
[46:43] maybe that we would think is an ordinary
[46:45] circumstance or situation. Brother Bam
[46:48] says, and I think it's the same today.
[46:49] Uh that many of us, we lose sight of our
[46:52] freedom.
[46:54] Have you ever lost sight of your
[46:55] freedom? I know I feel like I have in
[46:58] times. It it's it's situations that come
[47:02] around. something happens in our life
[47:04] and it feels like we'll never be able to
[47:06] see it. Like we said earlier, we make
[47:08] the worst thing is to make a promise to
[47:10] God and then actually break it. I don't
[47:13] want to look for a show of hands, but
[47:14] I'm I'm thinking probably I'm not the
[47:17] only one who has broken a promise to
[47:20] God, but isn't it wonderful that we have
[47:22] a God who is rich in mercy?
[47:26] &gt;&gt; He'll never leave us or forsake us.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know to Moses this
[47:32] situation it was revolutionary.
[47:35] It revolutionized his life and all of
[47:38] his thinking. Brother Brandham says but
[47:40] he says you you lose all thought of
[47:43] freedom as soon as the doctor says that
[47:47] it's incurable.
[47:49] Talking about the human condition how we
[47:51] can get caught up in circumstances and
[47:53] situations. It can be hopeless.
[47:56] Maybe a counselor will tell us it's
[47:58] hopeless. Maybe a doctor will tell us
[48:01] it's incurable.
[48:03] Maybe someone will say, "I'll never
[48:05] forgive you." Doesn't matter what
[48:08] happens on this side of eternity. We're
[48:10] dealing with God.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that he can't do.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; But as human beings, we can lose all
[48:17] thought of freedom. Sometimes it's
[48:19] addiction, smoking, drinking, and and I
[48:23] said this down there in the States, even
[48:25] pornography.
[48:26] We can give up hope and think that
[48:28] there's no way that we could ever be
[48:29] delivered from this temptation or this
[48:32] devil. Whatever it is in our life,
[48:35] I'm here to tell you he is the same
[48:37] yesterday, today, and forever.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Don't lose sight of your freedom. Don't
[48:41] lose hope of your freedom. That's what
[48:43] the devil wants you to do.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says, "Why,
[48:48] brother, if we'd ever come in the
[48:49] presence of God like Moses did, why it
[48:52] was a revolutionary to him. why it would
[48:56] revolutionize.
[48:58] And I just wonder tonight when I read
[49:00] this, I think how many people would not
[49:02] want to be revolutionized.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; I know I would want to be
[49:06] revolutionized. I I want to be
[49:08] revolutionized more than I am even now.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; But you know, I just want to say this
[49:14] and people might say, "Brother Barry,
[49:16] you're getting carnal." And I don't
[49:17] care. I'm going to do it.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Happy birthday, Sister Crystal.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] That's a sister whose life was
[49:25] revolutionized.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; We first met, we first met in a church
[49:31] fellowship. And when I met her, she was
[49:33] bald.
[49:35] That is a revolutionized person.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; She came in contact with that same
[49:40] pillar of fire
[49:42] &gt;&gt; that Moses did.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Happy birthday, sister.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; But I literally thought when brother
[49:48] Joel turned up, I didn't know who he
[49:50] was. She was this guy turned up and I
[49:52] thought this other guy turned up. These
[49:54] two guys turned up. She had no hair.
[49:59] Come to find out that she's a daughter
[50:00] of God.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Just amazing.
[50:05] We all have to be revolutionized by this
[50:09] pillar of fire.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; In the light of that angel of God
[50:15] standing there on that mountain that
[50:17] day. I love how he does that. It wasn't
[50:20] a pillar. It wasn't a burning bush. It
[50:21] wasn't a pillar of fire. It was a light
[50:22] of that angel standing there on the
[50:25] mount that day. The angel of God
[50:28] standing there on that mountain that
[50:29] day. Everything that he once had or
[50:32] thought never would happen come to be a
[50:37] reality. And I can tell you this guy's
[50:40] been revolutionized exactly that way.
[50:43] Because right around that time that was
[50:45] happening in my life, I had never
[50:47] thought that I would have a family. I
[50:49] never thought that I would ever dare go
[50:52] to church. I never thought that I would
[50:55] ever ever have a life worth living. That
[50:58] I would just be a single bachelor bum
[51:01] kind of guy. But look at what happens
[51:04] when you get in the presence of that
[51:05] light. Now, I want to say this, brothers
[51:07] and sisters. Where's the presence of
[51:08] that light? It's not necessarily in a
[51:10] bunch of special meetings. Sometimes
[51:12] it's in a Wednesday evening service.
[51:15] Sometimes it's just in someone's living
[51:17] room where you're talking about the
[51:18] pillar of fire. The angel of the Lord
[51:20] will come in
[51:23] &gt;&gt; and quicken that seed that's in that
[51:25] life.
[51:27] Brother Bradom says that I think if men
[51:29] and women today
[51:32] would ever step into the light of the
[51:35] Holy Spirit under the uncction of God's
[51:38] spirit and the light of God's word,
[51:41] everything that God has promised will
[51:44] illuminate to you
[51:46] &gt;&gt; and be real again.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Everything that he's promised
[51:51] &gt;&gt; will illuminate and become real. These
[51:54] are all quotes out of the the arrow of
[51:57] God's deliverance shot from a bow in
[51:59] 1956.
[52:02] He says, "The reason Moses failed in the
[52:04] first place, and it's the reason why
[52:06] everyone fails, the reason why he failed
[52:09] in the first place, here's what was the
[52:11] matter. It was the lack of having what
[52:13] the burning bush had,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; That anointing."
[52:19] He says, "That's right. And what's our
[52:21] failure today is lack of having what the
[52:23] Holy Spirit has. Now, some people might
[52:26] be saying even right now tonight in this
[52:28] church, Brother Barry, that was 1956.
[52:30] It's 2025. The book is open. Da da da.
[52:34] There's no more mysteries. You know,
[52:36] we're all learning at different rates.
[52:38] There's children that don't have the
[52:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost that need the
[52:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost. They need
[52:44] exactly that light, that life that was
[52:47] in that burning bush, just like we
[52:49] received as elders now in this word.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; But the same thing today is failure of
[52:56] the lack of what the Holy Spirit has.
[52:59] Outside of that, brothers and sisters,
[53:01] this is just religion.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; We have to say it. It's a one room
[53:06] schoolhouse.
[53:07] And I know we have people who understand
[53:10] it more and and have experienced more,
[53:12] but there's some that haven't.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And I really hope and pray that some of
[53:17] the elders have and that they haven't
[53:22] neglected to actually experience it that
[53:24] way.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; But you know, this promise is to us.
[53:26] This is where brother Brandham starts to
[53:28] to change a little bit and where I start
[53:30] to get a little bit excited. He says,
[53:31] "If we receive the Holy Spirit, then all
[53:33] things are possible." Yeah.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. not only possible but promised to
[53:38] us.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; I think it's an amazing thing to hear
[53:41] those words to to realize they're
[53:43] promised to us. They're not promised to
[53:45] everyone. We know his disciples said to
[53:47] Jesus when he was here, why do you speak
[53:49] in parables all the time? And he said to
[53:53] them, "If I do, then they should
[53:54] actually they'll be able to hear it and
[53:56] then they'll understand it. They'll be
[53:57] converted in their hearts and then
[53:59] they'll be saved. But it's not given to
[54:02] them. Blessed are your ears, for they
[54:05] have been given the ability to hear
[54:07] these things.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And you are the only ones that have been
[54:11] chosen to receive this word. But he
[54:13] says, if we receive the Holy Spirit,
[54:14] then all things are possible. Not only
[54:16] possible, but promised to us. Jesus
[54:18] said, "Ask the father anything in my
[54:21] name and I'll do it. If ye abide in me
[54:25] and my words in you, ask what you will,
[54:27] it shall be given to you." You see, when
[54:30] we step into the light of God's word
[54:32] with the uncction of the Holy Spirit to
[54:35] shine the light on it, brother, the
[54:37] impossible becomes little things. Then
[54:40] &gt;&gt; the doctor says you're going to die. I
[54:43] can never die. How could How can I die?
[54:45] I had a vindicated prophet tell me that
[54:47] I could never die.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And you're a doctor here on earth
[54:50] telling me that I'm going to die.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; What's the vindication of your ministry?
[54:54] I can show you the vindication of his
[54:56] ministry.
[54:58] I ain't going to die. I can never die.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I'll just fly away.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; But you know the critical factor to it
[55:08] is it's not how many years we've been in
[55:10] it. It's not how good people we are.
[55:14] It's not how we act or even think,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:18] &gt;&gt; It's got nothing to do with any of that.
[55:21] It's only about having faith.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's all about not having
[55:26] fear.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; We can look at the world today and and
[55:30] there's a lot of people living in fear
[55:32] tonight
[55:34] &gt;&gt; with what's going on in the US today.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people going around
[55:39] living in fear now. They've been living
[55:41] in fear for a while. But you know what's
[55:43] even more fearful to think is over in
[55:45] Poland now they're saying that Russia
[55:49] launched drones and all of the NATO
[55:51] alliance now all of Europe sprang to
[55:54] action last night. The closest they've
[55:57] ever been since World War II
[56:00] &gt;&gt; to open conflict is the words that are
[56:03] actually bouncing around.
[56:05] How close is it? How far down the road
[56:07] are we brothers and sisters?
[56:10] But we don't have to be afraid at all.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; I ain't saying that to make fear. I am
[56:16] saying that to create faith, to remind
[56:19] us about what the vindicated prophet
[56:20] said. Before any of that nonsense goes
[56:23] on, we go home.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But you know, the key to it is we've
[56:30] only been asked to believe it.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We've only been asked to believe it.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think that's what
[56:36] that promise was given to that that king
[56:39] who was was a backslider there. He was
[56:42] given a promise and all he had to do was
[56:44] believe it. But brother Brandham talks
[56:46] about how he just did his church duty.
[56:47] He did a civic duty. He took the arrows.
[56:49] The prophet gave them to him. He went
[56:50] down and made a show and said, "Oh, oh
[56:53] my father, my father, the chariots of
[56:54] Israel, the horsemen thereof." He said,
[56:56] "Oh, there's more more importance to you
[56:58] than the whole entire armies of of
[57:00] Israel." He made a show of it. And he
[57:03] did what? He did his his religious
[57:04] duties,
[57:06] but he didn't have revelation. He had
[57:08] the arrow of God's deliverance in his
[57:10] hand as the king. All he had to do was
[57:13] go by revelation. Now it's in my hand.
[57:15] It's not in the prophet's hand. It's in
[57:17] my hand.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You have the mind
[57:21] of Christ.
[57:23] You have thus sayaith the Lord."
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And you have the mind of Christ to know
[57:28] what to do with those arrows. So smite
[57:30] the ground.
[57:33] smite your enemy.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; More specifically,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Adam says God asks us to believe his
[57:40] word. He sends the Holy Spirit to
[57:42] energize that word when he falls into
[57:44] it. when we fall into his word, when his
[57:47] word falls into us, if we're willing to
[57:50] take the steps that he's given according
[57:52] to his word, Acts 2:38, to be baptized
[57:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[57:56] the remission of our sins, then he sends
[57:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost when until
[58:02] but he sends it. That's the promise.
[58:04] It's ours. He's promised it. And when he
[58:07] does that, he energizes the word that we
[58:10] hear and it becomes a brand new Bible.
[58:13] This message becomes a brand new
[58:14] message. All the ways that we thought
[58:17] before in the past, we can recognize
[58:19] they might not have actually lined up
[58:20] with the word of God for our day and we
[58:22] just want to recalibrate, you know, in
[58:24] our GPS. Sometimes we just need to hit
[58:26] recenter. We could be driving down the
[58:28] road and notice, wait a second, I know
[58:30] that it should show further down the
[58:32] road. I know that I should see a little
[58:34] bit of a different action on that GPS.
[58:36] So, I just need to hit that button,
[58:37] reenter. Sometimes I think that's what
[58:40] we need to do as a church of the living
[58:41] God, as human beings. Just hit that
[58:43] button, reenter, just come to church and
[58:46] say, "Lord, be it unto me according to
[58:48] your word." Sometimes I don't understand
[58:50] why I am the way I am. I don't
[58:52] understand what's going on the way it
[58:54] is. I feel like maybe my experience has
[58:55] gone just a little bit cold. We heard it
[58:58] on Thursday night. It was so good. We
[58:59] flew in Thursday during the day and we
[59:02] were able to find out they had a
[59:03] Thursday evening service. That's their
[59:05] midweek service. But brother Wayne, he
[59:07] preached a little bit and he talked
[59:08] about how sometimes we'll never see our
[59:10] salvation slip.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[59:14] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[59:16] your redemption. We get the Holy Ghost.
[59:17] We know that's what the prophet taught
[59:19] us. We get the Holy Ghost forever.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; We don't get it one day and then lose it
[59:24] the next and and and and and it doesn't
[59:26] happen that way. But what he said was
[59:28] sometimes things can slip in our lives.
[59:31] Sometimes we just don't have enough time
[59:32] for prayer. Sometimes we don't have
[59:34] enough time for reading the Bible.
[59:36] Sometimes we just don't have enough time
[59:38] for fellowship. Sometimes we let
[59:40] relationships slip. Sometimes we'll
[59:43] actually let work or pressures of life
[59:45] get in the way from being in church.
[59:47] Sometimes we have to travel. That's
[59:49] right. But when we come to the place
[59:51] where we say, "Ah, I'm just tired. I'm
[59:53] going to stay home and I'll just stream
[59:55] it or I'll pick it up tomorrow or
[59:57] whatever." When that starts to happen,
[59:59] that becomes problematic.
[1:00:01] That's what we're talking about. Life
[1:00:03] takes place. We travel. We live our
[1:00:05] lives. God knows. Brother Brandham says
[1:00:08] it's okay to go fishing and miss church.
[1:00:11] He says that. I say I'm so thankful for
[1:00:15] a prophet that loved to fish.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; But he says you don't plan your trip so
[1:00:20] that you're not in church. You plan your
[1:00:23] trips so that you can be in church. But
[1:00:25] once in a while it happens where you
[1:00:27] just can't be in church. But we know
[1:00:30] that God is with his people everywhere
[1:00:32] they go.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And he knows our heart desire. If we're
[1:00:35] running away to go and get away from
[1:00:37] church, that's what we're talking about.
[1:00:39] There's a problem.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; But God asks us only to believe his
[1:00:43] word. He sends his Holy Spirit to
[1:00:45] energize that word. When he falls into
[1:00:47] it, when the word's being preached and
[1:00:49] the Holy Spirit brings the word, he
[1:00:52] energizes and flashes the same light of
[1:00:55] God's blessed promise. And you know,
[1:00:58] brothers and sisters, I just can't help
[1:01:00] but think that's exactly what happened
[1:01:02] in 2 Kings 13:21. They didn't recognize
[1:01:05] what was going on. Let's just jump down
[1:01:08] to 21 of 2 Kings chapter 13. I think we
[1:01:11] read this last Sunday.
[1:01:14] And it came to pass as they were burying
[1:01:15] a man that behold they spied a band of
[1:01:17] men. Now the men were coming through the
[1:01:19] land. They were actually getting
[1:01:21] invaded. That king could have actually
[1:01:23] smoked till the enemy was gone. But he
[1:01:25] here's the enemy coming through the
[1:01:27] land. So behold, they spied a band of
[1:01:29] men and and they cast the man into the
[1:01:32] suppler of Elisha. It was convenient
[1:01:35] where they could just throw him in there
[1:01:36] and and he would be safe and they could
[1:01:38] quickly hide. And when the man was let
[1:01:40] down and touched the bones of Elisha, he
[1:01:42] revived and stood up upon his feet.
[1:01:45] Let's not keep that back there. Some
[1:01:47] people want to do that and that's fine.
[1:01:49] But I think the church of the living God
[1:01:51] who understands the seventh angel
[1:01:52] messenger, Revelations 10:7, Luke 17:30,
[1:01:56] all of the key scriptures, Malachi 45:5
[1:01:59] and 6, we have seen Elijah. And this
[1:02:02] Elijah anointing is just as powerful
[1:02:05] tonight as it was back there. And if we
[1:02:07] could just ever get ourselves down into
[1:02:09] that septa, I'm not saying run to
[1:02:11] Jeffersonville, Indiana. Don't buy a
[1:02:13] plane ticket and run there. I'm I
[1:02:14] although there is an anointing there,
[1:02:17] but there's just the same anointing
[1:02:18] here. Brothers and sisters, his word
[1:02:20] says where two or three are gathered
[1:02:21] together in his name that he's there and
[1:02:23] he's greater than the prophet.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; We know that greater than a Solomon is
[1:02:28] even here even tonight.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; But this anointing, this anointing is
[1:02:33] what I want to talk about tonight. This
[1:02:34] anointing is our anointing. This is the
[1:02:36] anointing that we get through this
[1:02:39] vindicated prophet. It's the same
[1:02:40] prophet.
[1:02:42] It's a matching time, brother Brandham
[1:02:44] says. You know that's true. It's a
[1:02:46] matching time. Amen. They must have went
[1:02:48] home. That's right. Listen, it's true.
[1:02:50] Now, now I'm going to tell you, my
[1:02:52] brother, I don't care whether my shoes
[1:02:55] matches my trousers or my trousers
[1:02:58] matches my coat. He says this, I want my
[1:03:02] experience to match God's Bible.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; That's the matching time.
[1:03:07] He says, "If you want to match
[1:03:08] something, match your experience against
[1:03:11] Paul's."
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Many people will say, "Well, we match
[1:03:15] our experience to our church, to our
[1:03:17] theological institution, to the
[1:03:20] mothership, our association. Does any of
[1:03:23] that match Paul's experience? Because if
[1:03:26] it doesn't, why do you do it?"
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He was the first church age messenger. I
[1:03:31] know why. Because we want a meal ticket.
[1:03:34] Because we're afraid.
[1:03:36] We preach this real hard down south. You
[1:03:39] know what? Just just try God at his
[1:03:41] word. His word in Malachi says, "Prove
[1:03:43] me in this and see if I won't pour out a
[1:03:45] blessing from heaven that you can't even
[1:03:47] contain."
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; But he says, "If you want to match
[1:03:52] something, match your experience against
[1:03:54] Paul's." Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And you know, we we talked about it down
[1:03:57] there. It's more than just tithing. It's
[1:04:00] more than just tithing. Just getting
[1:04:02] obedient to God's word brings such a
[1:04:03] blessing, such an incredible blessing to
[1:04:05] our lives where we would attract other
[1:04:07] people. They would say, "What is it
[1:04:09] about you? Why are you the way you are?"
[1:04:12] And you can say, "Come see a man who
[1:04:14] told me the things that I've done. Come
[1:04:16] and see what it's all about. Just come
[1:04:18] one time and get in that anointing that
[1:04:20] we're talking about and see if it does
[1:04:23] anything for you."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; But it's got to match Paul's experience.
[1:04:26] Amen. That's what we need today is a
[1:04:28] matching time with Paul's faith in the
[1:04:32] Bible. That's our example, right? And
[1:04:35] now, if you know, if you've studied the
[1:04:37] Hebrews series, you know, brother
[1:04:38] Brandham, he talks about it. How Paul,
[1:04:40] he actually was knocked off the horse
[1:04:43] when he was on his road to Damascus to
[1:04:45] lay waste the church of the living God.
[1:04:48] He was going to do his thing. And what
[1:04:49] happened? He was knocked off his high
[1:04:51] horse. He got a revelation from God and
[1:04:54] and he went into the city and and we
[1:04:56] know the story. He lost his vision. He
[1:04:58] got his vision. But what happened? He
[1:05:00] was a scholar. He was the Hebrew of
[1:05:02] Hebrews of the tribe of Benjamin
[1:05:03] circumcised on the eighth. We know the
[1:05:05] whole story about Paul. But what did he
[1:05:08] do? He didn't just take and say, "Well,
[1:05:09] I had a tremendous experience. Now hear
[1:05:11] me."
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; He went into the backside of the desert
[1:05:14] just like Moses did. And he found that
[1:05:16] pillar of fire for himself. But where
[1:05:18] did he find it? Was in the word. Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; He needed to see if all of this stuff
[1:05:24] being talked about, all of his
[1:05:26] experience now lined up with the word of
[1:05:28] God.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this tonight, if we
[1:05:31] have any questions about this message of
[1:05:33] the hour, take it back to the word of
[1:05:35] God.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; See if it doesn't line up. See, if it's
[1:05:39] not exactly according to Paul's
[1:05:41] experience,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; and you'll see it is.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it's a separating
[1:05:49] time. this borderline believing this
[1:05:51] halfway lukewarm. Do you know the Bible
[1:05:53] said this day would come? The Leodysian
[1:05:55] church age. He said you would just be a
[1:05:58] lukewarm and make God sick at his
[1:06:00] stomach. He said he would spew you from
[1:06:03] his mouth. The Leodysian just enough
[1:06:05] religion to make you sick.
[1:06:09] I hope no none of us are that way in our
[1:06:12] hearts.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I say Lord help me. I don't want a
[1:06:15] religion. I don't excuse me. I don't
[1:06:17] want a tradition. I don't want to be
[1:06:19] that way,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire for the Lord.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "We're still longing for the
[1:06:30] things of the world. Say, I'd better not
[1:06:33] do that." Oh, brother, if I wanted to do
[1:06:36] it, I'd do it. But I know tonight that
[1:06:39] there's a good old-fashioned baptism of
[1:06:41] the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It makes you love God so well, you don't
[1:06:45] care to do it anymore. Amen. And you
[1:06:48] know, brother Bammy talked about it. I I
[1:06:50] drink as much as I want to drink. I
[1:06:52] smoke as much as I want to smoke. And
[1:06:55] and I do all the things that I want to
[1:06:57] do. I'm going to say it this way
[1:06:58] tonight. I I look at as much pornography
[1:07:00] as I want to.
[1:07:03] Not because I do, but I'm saying it that
[1:07:06] way because I don't have the desire to
[1:07:07] do it, brothers and sisters.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, I would be a liar if
[1:07:11] I said I've never been tempted to. Let's
[1:07:14] just call it straight. It's an evil
[1:07:16] devil that's attacking the church of the
[1:07:18] living God.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; And you know what? An exposed devil is a
[1:07:22] dead devil.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And as long as we keep him undercover
[1:07:26] and pretend like nothing's happening,
[1:07:28] he's just going to keep right on going.
[1:07:30] But let's call it as it is.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; It's just a temptation. But if that
[1:07:35] temptation is given into, it can become
[1:07:38] an addiction. And if that addiction gets
[1:07:40] a hold, then it's going to make us feel
[1:07:42] like we've lost all hope for freedom.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; All of that freedom is still completely
[1:07:48] available tonight.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; He's still calling tonight. He's still
[1:07:52] offering an abundance of deliverance
[1:07:55] tonight.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And all we've got to do is raise our
[1:07:59] hands and say, "Forgive me, Lord." Even
[1:08:01] right now where we're sitting, we can
[1:08:03] just say, "Forgive me, Lord." He knows
[1:08:05] your heart. We don't have to carry
[1:08:07] around these burdens.
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; It's a devil.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; But you know, his word said, "Come out
[1:08:16] from among her.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Come out from among them, my people. Be
[1:08:20] ye separate."
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; God wants us to know the truth. God
[1:08:27] loves the truth, and the truth shall set
[1:08:29] you free.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; God wants you to know the truth.
[1:08:34] Christ is the truth, the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:38] This is why I harp about it, brothers
[1:08:39] and sisters.
[1:08:42] We have been given the arrow of God's
[1:08:44] deliverance.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And as as I talk about this, I just
[1:08:48] can't help but think, you know, the
[1:08:50] children of Israel were given the
[1:08:52] deliverance in their time in Gan.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; They had seen all of the promises come
[1:08:57] to pass. They'd seen the signs and the
[1:08:59] wonders, but now the death angel was
[1:09:01] coming through the land. I can only
[1:09:03] imagine that they struck those doorposts
[1:09:07] and they struck the lentil. They wanted
[1:09:10] to make sure that that blood token was
[1:09:13] going to stick.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; We have the ability to do that with the
[1:09:18] arrow of God's deliverance.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; The anointing that we've been given by
[1:09:23] the prophet in our day is an arrow shot
[1:09:26] from a bow.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And you know it's an arrow of
[1:09:29] deliverance.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we've been given the
[1:09:32] arrows to take in our hands and smite
[1:09:36] the enemy
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; until he's done.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Don't stop smiting, brothers and
[1:09:41] sisters.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, he talks about this king.
[1:09:44] This old king Joash heard that the
[1:09:47] prophet was sick and he went down to
[1:09:48] visit him. And when he went to visit
[1:09:50] him, he didn't come irreverent.
[1:09:53] He would come with respect. He walked
[1:09:55] up. He had enough God about him to know
[1:09:58] that he must visit this prophet with
[1:09:59] respect. So he walked up and wept over
[1:10:02] him and said, "My father, my father, the
[1:10:03] chariots of Israel, horsemen thereof."
[1:10:05] And when he did, God had respect for
[1:10:09] him.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; God gave him respect. You know, even
[1:10:12] Ahab, he was a bad dude.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't listen to the anointing of
[1:10:17] God. But if you read in the word, you'll
[1:10:20] see it. I I don't know where it is in
[1:10:21] Kings, maybe, but where Ahab was such a
[1:10:24] bad guy, he finally got enough. God had
[1:10:28] enough of him, and he said, "You know
[1:10:29] what? The prophet told him this thing
[1:10:31] about you letting the neck turn your
[1:10:33] head. The woman's ruling your house.
[1:10:35] This evil woman is taking control of
[1:10:37] everything. And now you've let her go
[1:10:39] and kill Neabboth who was supposed to
[1:10:41] get his father's inheritance. Now we're
[1:10:44] done.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; The dogs are going to lick your blood
[1:10:48] and the dogs are going to eat her. We
[1:10:51] know that was given to him. And when he
[1:10:53] heard that, what did he do? The Bible
[1:10:56] says that he walked softly. Oh no. Woo!
[1:11:00] I done it this time. He wasn't walking
[1:11:02] around with his chest out. Oh, I'm the
[1:11:04] king and I've got this woman and you
[1:11:07] know, he walked softly. And the word
[1:11:10] says that God honored it and said, "You
[1:11:12] know what? I won't do it in your day.
[1:11:13] Your eyes won't see it, but your kids
[1:11:16] are going to get it."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "See, that's the
[1:11:25] way you want to get something from God.
[1:11:27] Don't come around a meeting. I love how
[1:11:30] he says this because it's the same
[1:11:31] today. Don't come around a meeting like
[1:11:34] this to make fun. Don't come around to
[1:11:38] pack some kind of a tail from one place
[1:11:40] to another. If you do that, you'll never
[1:11:43] get nowhere with God.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Never. We won't. But if we come with the
[1:11:49] right attitude,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; but if we come with the wrong attitude,
[1:11:52] what's going to happen is we're going to
[1:11:53] mess up the service for everyone else
[1:11:55] and we're going to lose the blessing
[1:11:56] ourselves. He says, if you do that,
[1:11:59] you'll never get nowhere with God. Don't
[1:12:01] read the Bible to fuss about it. And I
[1:12:03] say this tonight, don't read the message
[1:12:05] to fuss about it.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Just believe it.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But some people would say, "Well, then
[1:12:14] you're just following a cult."
[1:12:17] And maybe for some people that's as far
[1:12:19] as it'll ever go. Maybe there just isn't
[1:12:22] the seed chain of God inside to actually
[1:12:24] be quickened when this word comes. We
[1:12:26] know that there was millions of people
[1:12:28] in the in in in the days of Israel when
[1:12:30] they were coming out of bondage. They
[1:12:31] just never had faith in their heart to
[1:12:34] mix with that word. That's what brother
[1:12:35] Brandham said the difference was. There
[1:12:36] was nothing in them to mix with that
[1:12:38] word. Even though the generations down
[1:12:41] the road down the road down the road,
[1:12:43] they had the word standing in front of
[1:12:44] them. the word made flesh standing in
[1:12:46] front of them. And they said, "Oh, we
[1:12:48] have Abraham to father." And he said,
[1:12:50] "Don't you think that I could raise up
[1:12:53] stones? Oh my. Don't you think that you
[1:12:57] your father is going to save you because
[1:12:59] if you believed him, you would actually
[1:13:01] believe me."
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't read the Bible to fuss
[1:13:05] about it. Read the Bible to live it."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible to live it. And then he
[1:13:11] just goes into, "You know what we need?"
[1:13:13] He says, "So then when he went down
[1:13:15] there and he seen him and respected him,
[1:13:16] he said, "My father, my father, the
[1:13:18] chariots of Israel, there are other
[1:13:19] horses." In other words, my father,
[1:13:21] you're worth more than all the chariots
[1:13:22] of Israel and all the horsemen thereof.
[1:13:24] How true that is. I say tonight, though
[1:13:27] Elijah was considered a holy roller,
[1:13:29] it's interesting that he says it this
[1:13:31] way because it was Elisha. But Elijah
[1:13:34] was considered a holy roller, a fanatic
[1:13:37] by the modern world. Yet he his presence
[1:13:40] in the nation was worth more than all
[1:13:42] the horses and chariots they had. And
[1:13:44] I'll say tonight, a good old-fashioned
[1:13:47] Holy Ghost tent meeting is more to
[1:13:50] protect us than all the atomic bombs
[1:13:52] that we could create in a million years.
[1:13:55] Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful to think?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And it just it just reinforces to me
[1:14:03] there's really only one thing and that
[1:14:04] is the Holy Ghost
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; in our lives. then all of this message
[1:14:07] when it's preached will just become
[1:14:09] alive to us. We'll understand it and and
[1:14:11] and it will become a new the Bible will
[1:14:14] become a new book. But he goes on to say
[1:14:16] he said God had respect and because he
[1:14:19] come and approached it reverently God
[1:14:22] had respect to him. And I I want to say
[1:14:24] tonight brothers and sisters if we have
[1:14:26] a need in our lives even if we don't
[1:14:29] understand it even if it feels like
[1:14:30] maybe we've sinned away our day of grace
[1:14:33] I want to tell you tonight he's still
[1:14:35] calling.
[1:14:37] The windows of heaven are open and and
[1:14:39] his blessings are still falling. And
[1:14:41] alls we have to do is approach him
[1:14:44] correctly. And if we're willing to do
[1:14:46] that, he's there waiting and ready to
[1:14:50] forgive our transgressions. You know
[1:14:52] what? I would say this. He's already
[1:14:53] forgiven our transgressions. We just
[1:14:56] need to recognize it
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; because it was all paid for once and for
[1:15:00] all at Calvary, wasn't it?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; One time. Amen. one sacrifice and that
[1:15:06] one went and sat down on the right hand
[1:15:08] of the father on high to be the
[1:15:11] intercessor for our saints. But because
[1:15:14] he came the right way, God app God had
[1:15:17] respect for him. He respected Elijah. He
[1:15:21] says he said, "Oh my father, how we need
[1:15:24] you." God respected it and he respected
[1:15:27] Elijah and God respected him. And I want
[1:15:30] to say this tonight, whether we
[1:15:32] understand it or not, let's not have
[1:15:34] disrespect for the prophet in our day,
[1:15:37] for Elijah in our day.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Boy oh boy, when we start doing that,
[1:15:43] God's not going to have respect for us.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; He says, if you'll respect God's Bible
[1:15:49] and God's Holy Spirit, he will respect
[1:15:53] you. Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Don't try to contradict it or say it
[1:15:57] isn't so. Just believe it. That's all.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And I know that's where the
[1:16:02] intellectuals will say, well, we need to
[1:16:04] understand it. We need to explain it.
[1:16:05] You know, the word says that we need to
[1:16:07] be wise as serpents and harmless as
[1:16:09] doves. And if we're not careful, we can
[1:16:12] be the message believers and all the
[1:16:14] rest of the people or maybe serpent seed
[1:16:17] and maybe cannon fodder at best. And you
[1:16:19] know, we want to try and convert people.
[1:16:21] So, we're going to live a life that's
[1:16:23] going to be a message believer and we're
[1:16:25] going to have the the pompous attitude
[1:16:28] in this world. We're smarter than that,
[1:16:30] aren't we?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Aren't we smarter than that?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; We understand that we're not going to
[1:16:35] attract people by behaving that way.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Legalism is going to detract people.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Love is going to attract people.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Love is what's going to get people's
[1:16:47] attention. They're going to say, "What
[1:16:48] is it about you? Everyone else is a
[1:16:51] backstabber. Everyone else has negative
[1:16:54] thoughts and negative words. But there's
[1:16:57] something different about you.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Don't contradict it. Just just just
[1:17:03] believe it. And I think that we have the
[1:17:06] opportunity. I you know, we've talked
[1:17:07] about it in the church age book. Brother
[1:17:09] Brandham really drills down on it. You
[1:17:11] know, there's going to be people that
[1:17:12] don't have their name on the book of
[1:17:13] life right now tonight
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; that will get their name put on it.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. just for one reason
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and that's for doing good to the bride
[1:17:21] of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Just for doing good to the bride of
[1:17:25] Jesus Christ, just for a cup of cold
[1:17:27] water won't be forgotten. We have the
[1:17:30] opportunity to set the atmosphere in our
[1:17:32] lives for people. And brother Bradam
[1:17:35] said, "I want to take as many people
[1:17:36] with me as I can." Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I just don't think it's the right
[1:17:41] attitude if we think that people are
[1:17:43] just scum and you know they they deserve
[1:17:46] it, you know, whatever they get. No, no,
[1:17:48] no, no. We want to see every single soul
[1:17:51] go that could go. We want to see the
[1:17:53] Lord's people redeemed.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say,
[1:18:01] he that's just about the same that's
[1:18:04] happened tonight in the Christian
[1:18:05] church. We've struck the arrow of God's
[1:18:08] deliverance.
[1:18:10] And he said it was. God sent the arrow
[1:18:12] of deliverance to us. The arrow of
[1:18:16] deliverance is the Holy Spirit that's
[1:18:18] been sent.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Shot from the bow of God's love. Right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; When the eternity to eternity was pulled
[1:18:26] together by the cord of love, God shot
[1:18:29] the arrow of deliverance into the church
[1:18:32] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:18:35] And the church was given in her hands.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. The church was given in her
[1:18:40] hand the arrow of God's deliverance.
[1:18:44] Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; And what is the arrow of God's
[1:18:47] deliverance?
[1:18:48] He says it,
[1:18:51] but he talks about how the church is
[1:18:52] striking short with it. And I I just
[1:18:55] think it's so beautiful because this
[1:18:58] king was given instruction. And if he
[1:19:01] only had revelation to mix with that
[1:19:04] word to with that instruction that came
[1:19:06] that he had those arrows
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; and there was no limit to the amount of
[1:19:10] times that he could have struck but he
[1:19:13] limited himself for some reason. He
[1:19:16] brother Ratomy he says in the church
[1:19:18] tonight hear me the church tonight is
[1:19:20] still striking short. In other places he
[1:19:23] says that we live miles below our
[1:19:27] privilege.
[1:19:28] Help us Lord not to live below our
[1:19:30] privilege.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And the church tonight, hear me, the
[1:19:33] church tonight is still striking short.
[1:19:35] The church has struck short of the
[1:19:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It struck
[1:19:41] short of deliverance from sin.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; It struck short. I want to say tonight,
[1:19:47] brothers and sisters, have we struck
[1:19:49] short in our lives in any areas? And
[1:19:51] I'll tell you, I know I've struck short.
[1:19:54] And I've struck short even as a pastor
[1:19:56] here. I'm not afraid to admit it,
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; but that don't mean that I've struck
[1:20:01] out.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And it don't mean that you've struck
[1:20:04] out. We have the ability to strike hard
[1:20:08] our enemy and not stop
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; until he's done.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And I think it's a literal thing. He
[1:20:15] says, "Oh, you say I belong to church,
[1:20:18] brother. When you got that baptism of
[1:20:20] the old Holy Ghost, when you got that
[1:20:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it takes that
[1:20:25] old temper out of you,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; We don't make excuses for this and say,
[1:20:31] "Well, it's just this and well, it's
[1:20:33] just that." Brother Brandham, he says it
[1:20:35] takes that old temper out of you. That's
[1:20:36] what the Holy Ghost does. It puts you on
[1:20:39] a dress and makes you act like a lady.
[1:20:42] And I said this in the States. I said,
[1:20:44] "Now, I ain't saying go put on a dress
[1:20:46] to the men. Don't do it. That's not what
[1:20:49] he's saying here. He's talking to the
[1:20:51] sisters that believe wearing pants is
[1:20:53] okay. And I'm sure we all understand
[1:20:55] that tonight, but we are maybe live or
[1:20:57] being recorded and people need to know
[1:20:59] that. Unfortunately, it's the world that
[1:21:01] we live in.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It causes the women to put on a dress.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; To not wear a garment that pertains to a
[1:21:09] man according to what Paul taught the
[1:21:11] church. Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And I would say this, it causes the
[1:21:16] women to recognize that it's
[1:21:17] inappropriate
[1:21:19] to try and be the leaders.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; It's inappropriate to try and preach in
[1:21:24] a church.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Because that's what Paul taught.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; But that's what the Holy Ghost says. It
[1:21:32] puts on a dress and makes you act like a
[1:21:34] lady. It'll make you quit your smoking,
[1:21:36] your drinking, your lying, your
[1:21:38] stealing, and everything. And I'll say
[1:21:40] it loud and clear. You don't have to be
[1:21:42] a member of a 12step program for the
[1:21:45] rest of your life claiming that you are
[1:21:47] an alcoholic.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; There comes a point in time where you
[1:21:50] recognize that you're no longer an
[1:21:52] alcoholic. In fact, you never were an
[1:21:54] alcoholic. You just were a crow that was
[1:21:56] tied by the ankle by a demon. You always
[1:21:59] were a son of the living God. And you
[1:22:02] can live in a free life, a totally free
[1:22:04] existence.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It'll make you quit your
[1:22:10] smoking and drinking and lying and
[1:22:12] stealing and everything.
[1:22:15] You know, one of the worst ones in there
[1:22:16] is lying
[1:22:18] because you don't smoke and you don't
[1:22:20] stink like smoke and you're not drinking
[1:22:22] and you're not burping and swearing and
[1:22:25] acting like a drunk. But boy, those
[1:22:28] little white lies
[1:22:30] and and what's worse, a little white lie
[1:22:32] or a big lie? I'll tell you. I got an
[1:22:34] opinion. I'm strongly opinionated with
[1:22:37] this. those little white lies are worse.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And the word says that it's the little
[1:22:41] foxes that spoil the viide. It's not the
[1:22:43] big things. It's just those little tiny
[1:22:44] foxes, those little white lies. Because
[1:22:47] those little lies turn into other lies
[1:22:49] and other lies and other lies and other
[1:22:50] lies. And we know the word of God says
[1:22:52] that unfortunately there will be no room
[1:22:54] for liars in that city.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; But it'll make you quit your smoking.
[1:23:00] It'll make you quit your drinking. It'll
[1:23:03] make you quit your lying, your stealing.
[1:23:06] And and I love what he says here.
[1:23:08] Everything.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Brother, when you got the baptism of the
[1:23:14] Holy Ghost, it separates you.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mix you with the world.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; It separates you from the world.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And I love it. We had a conversation one
[1:23:24] time in a young people's and one of the
[1:23:26] brothers he said you know sometimes your
[1:23:28] own testimony of being a believer living
[1:23:31] as a believer even if you try and blend
[1:23:34] in with those other people in the youth
[1:23:36] they'll say no you can't do that because
[1:23:38] that's not you won't even let you do
[1:23:40] that
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; your own testimony precedes your life
[1:23:45] which is amazing brother Brandham goes
[1:23:47] on to say it delivers you from all the
[1:23:49] things of the world amen it makes you
[1:23:51] love God makes you go go to church. It
[1:23:54] makes you worship him.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; It makes you tell your neighbor about
[1:23:58] it.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; It makes you live above sin.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Brown. I mean, in this message, he says,
[1:24:07] "Why we ain't a modern denomination, but
[1:24:09] the modern church has struck short of
[1:24:11] it."
[1:24:14] That's why I'm so thankful that we're
[1:24:15] not a modern church.
[1:24:17] The first time I came into the church in
[1:24:19] the upper room, it reminded me of my
[1:24:21] grandmother's church. Not even my church
[1:24:23] that I grew up in downtown Calgary,
[1:24:25] Emanuel Assembly of God. It was just a
[1:24:27] little Pentecostal church in Claire's
[1:24:29] home, Alberta. And I this summer went to
[1:24:31] a funeral there. My aunt passed away and
[1:24:33] that was her church where she went to.
[1:24:35] And I was able to go in there and just
[1:24:37] relive some memories. But the church,
[1:24:38] when I first came to the upper room when
[1:24:40] brother Ken was a pastor and there's
[1:24:41] just a few families here, it was it just
[1:24:43] reminded me so much of being a little
[1:24:46] kid and going to church with my
[1:24:47] grandmother and there was reverence in
[1:24:50] the building there. It was reverent.
[1:24:52] People came in and sat down and there
[1:24:54] was someone softly playing and it was
[1:24:56] just it was just amazing. It was just
[1:24:58] exactly what I needed at the right time.
[1:25:01] But brother Brown, I mean, he talks
[1:25:02] about why we're not a modern church. The
[1:25:04] modern church has struck short of it.
[1:25:07] And if you ever see the way modern
[1:25:08] churches behave, you understand they
[1:25:11] have struck short of it. Oh, they say we
[1:25:14] got a church. We got a good teacher. We
[1:25:17] got theology. Sometimes they've got 30
[1:25:19] teachers.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; He says that's about as much as you know
[1:25:23] about it. Every promise in the book is
[1:25:25] mine. Every chapter, every verse, every
[1:25:27] line. Hallelujah. God sent the baptism
[1:25:30] of the Holy Ghost to put it into the
[1:25:32] hands of the church. the arrow of God's
[1:25:34] deliverance to deliver from sickness,
[1:25:36] from sin, from worry, from trouble, from
[1:25:39] worldliness, from everything else,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; but we've struck short of it. Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I trust tonight, brothers and sisters,
[1:25:48] that if we've struck short of it
[1:25:51] sometimes in our life, we do.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I've done it.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Don't stay short of it.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Pick up the arrows and strike hard.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] He says, "God shot his arrow of
[1:26:04] deliverance. The baptism of the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost in the last days has come to the
[1:26:10] Gentiles in the Western countries." I'll
[1:26:12] call them musicians.
[1:26:14] And God shot the arrow of deliverance to
[1:26:17] us. So, not just to the Gentiles on mass
[1:26:22] on the Isuza Street revival, which he
[1:26:24] did. Those people that were there,
[1:26:26] whoever was there, just fell under that
[1:26:28] anointing and and got to see it. But
[1:26:30] he's sent his arrow of deliverance to
[1:26:32] us.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And he says, we have just about struck
[1:26:36] it long enough to make oursel, oh, I'm
[1:26:39] assembly. Hallelujah. I belong to the
[1:26:41] church of God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] That don't do you a bit of good, right?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And you know where brother Barry would
[1:26:48] go here with this. I belong to the
[1:26:50] message of the hour. Nope. It's not
[1:26:52] enough,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. The devils believe
[1:26:56] that and they tremble too because they
[1:26:59] know it's true. They recognize what
[1:27:01] happened.
[1:27:04] Just being a part of it ain't enough. We
[1:27:06] have got to get the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:08] Ghost, brothers and sisters. And if
[1:27:10] we've got it, we need to teach our
[1:27:12] children that. He says, "Brother, it's
[1:27:14] not an organization." Maybe stand with
[1:27:16] me as we read these last couple.
[1:27:18] Brother, it's not an organization that
[1:27:19] God said strike with. It's not being a
[1:27:22] member. It's not because we're here that
[1:27:25] we strike with it.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; God never said strike with an
[1:27:28] organization. He said it's given to each
[1:27:30] individual to strike against the powers
[1:27:33] of the devil.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; For sickness, it's sickness, sin,
[1:27:37] filthiness, backbiting, cussing.
[1:27:40] Oh my worldiness. Amen. You know, I've
[1:27:43] heard about it recently and and and in
[1:27:46] the past, you know, sometimes people
[1:27:47] will cuss.
[1:27:49] There's something wrong there.
[1:27:52] Believers don't cuss.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Believers don't lie.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Believers don't smoke or drink.
[1:28:00] But there's deliverance from this
[1:28:02] filthiness and backbiting.
[1:28:04] Brother Brandham's saying this. The
[1:28:07] Elisha for our day. I just can't help
[1:28:10] but think, brothers and sisters, he's
[1:28:12] gone off the scene just like this
[1:28:14] prophet went off the scene. Before he
[1:28:16] did, he gave the bow to the king and and
[1:28:20] he said, "Open the window." And when he
[1:28:23] did, he put his hands on that king's
[1:28:26] hands.
[1:28:28] I can't help but think that prophets put
[1:28:30] his hands on our hands tonight.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "We strike short." Oh, we we go
[1:28:35] over to church and we join church and we
[1:28:37] think that's all right. That's not all
[1:28:39] right, brother. Don't strike short of
[1:28:41] nothing of God's blessings. The Bible
[1:28:43] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:28:45] today, and forever. Strike it. Amen.
[1:28:48] Don't be afraid.
[1:28:51] We don't have to be afraid. Strike it.
[1:28:54] If we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:28:57] then we have the mind of Christ.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; To know what to do with it.
[1:29:03] God said so. I'm the Lord that heal
[1:29:06] thee. Strike it.
[1:29:08] God said so. It's the arrow of
[1:29:10] deliverance. It's brought into the
[1:29:12] church tonight. And you know, even
[1:29:15] though that was 1956, Hebrews 13:8,
[1:29:19] do you agree?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:29:23] forever.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; The exact same anointing that was on
[1:29:26] those bones of Elisha is the exact same
[1:29:29] anointing that comes from reading this
[1:29:32] prophet's message.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And it's not this prophet's message.
[1:29:36] It's God's message through this prophet.
[1:29:39] When we do that, brothers and sisters,
[1:29:40] the same anointing is is here right now
[1:29:43] amongst us. If anybody has any troubles
[1:29:46] with anything in your life tonight,
[1:29:48] there is that deliverance right here,
[1:29:50] right now. You don't have to leave this
[1:29:52] building with that with you.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Don't take it with you. Leave it.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Leave it here. Give it to the Lord.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Drive down a stake and say, "From this
[1:30:01] time forwards, I'm not going to do that
[1:30:04] anymore. And Lord, give me strength.
[1:30:06] Help me to strike those arrows
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; because he's given them to us.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:30:17] you for this message.
[1:30:19] Thank you for your arrow of deliverance
[1:30:21] that's been given to the Gentile church.
[1:30:24] And Lord, even further than to the G
[1:30:26] gentile church, Lord, to your bride, to
[1:30:28] your believers.
[1:30:30] We know that Lord, you're still calling.
[1:30:33] And we thank you for that. Lord, we can
[1:30:35] see the the oncoming storm is becoming
[1:30:39] so prevalent in this world. But Lord,
[1:30:42] you have given us deliverance. You have
[1:30:45] given us a way of escape, Lord.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And we know that's in you. Father,
[1:30:51] tonight I pray that if anyone has struck
[1:30:54] short, Lord, in their life, Father, we
[1:30:56] know it's not a group experience. It's
[1:30:58] all about the individual experience.
[1:31:01] Help us, Lord Jesus, to grab a hold of
[1:31:03] those arrows and strike, Lord, until we
[1:31:06] see a change in our lives.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Let us not let up, not one bit, even if
[1:31:12] we do see a change. Help us, Lord Jesus,
[1:31:15] to not get weary. Help us to not get
[1:31:18] complacent, Lord, but help us to be
[1:31:20] fervent on fire for you, Lord Jesus.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Knowing that you will deliver us.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; That you will deliver our children.
[1:31:30] Hallelujah.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That you will deliver our spouse.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; You'll deliver our marriage.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You'll deliver our church, Father.
[1:31:37] You'll deliver our young people. Every
[1:31:39] one of us needs deliverance, Lord.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Help us to not strike short. Father, we
[1:31:44] ask.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And if anybody has any needs, Father,
[1:31:48] tonight,
[1:31:49] Lord, we pray together, united in one
[1:31:52] mind and one accord, that you would meet
[1:31:54] those needs, Father.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we need deliverance from any
[1:31:58] one of those things that were mentioned
[1:31:59] tonight, Father, Lord Jesus, we just ask
[1:32:02] Lord humbly that you would deliver us
[1:32:05] from it now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:07] Help us, Lord, to have the right
[1:32:09] approach to you to be sincere, oh Lord,
[1:32:12] and to give you the preeminence that you
[1:32:14] desire in our lives.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[1:32:19] just ask Lord now that as we go our
[1:32:21] separate ways that we would see the
[1:32:23] arrow of your deliverance in our lives
[1:32:26] individually Lord Jesus. Father we pray
[1:32:29] for brother Andrew as he travels Lord as
[1:32:32] he wraps up service tonight in Vancouver
[1:32:34] that Lord you would just bring him here
[1:32:36] safely Lord and Father help us Lord to
[1:32:40] push aside all of our carnality and
[1:32:42] allow you to wash us by the water of
[1:32:44] your word this weekend father. Lord, we
[1:32:47] love you and we thank you. We just ask
[1:32:49] now that you would be glorified in a
[1:32:51] couple songs. Lord, we ask that you
[1:32:54] would be with those who are away
[1:32:55] tonight, wherever they are, that you
[1:32:57] would just minister to them sovereignly,
[1:32:59] Lord.
