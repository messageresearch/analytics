morning welcome to the house of the Lord it's so wonderful to see everyone's face I just can't get uh I can't get past this business of being empty here I trust the Lord will open the door soon real soon thank you musicians this morning if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from Matthew chapter 12. I have a little bit of a different direction this morning and I I don't know I apologize it seems like I'm almost like a ping pong ball that I just go all over the place but I just believe I have to follow the leadership of the Lord and when he speaks I have to follow it and uh I think we'll just continually sort of go around and around it and over top of these things and we'll just trust that the Lord will bless it in uh Matthew chapter 12 I'd like to begin reading with verse 38. just read verse 38. then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from the let's just bow in prayer our gracious Lord Jesus we're so thankful father for your word we're so thankful for your leadership and your guidance we're so thankful that you have a program Lord and that you never change and that you are as immutable in your ways as you are in your thoughts and father the thoughts that you have towards us are of love and of peace and Lord you are not the author of confusion but you have given us power and a sound mind and father we just want to take your word this morning and apply it to our lives father we don't want to put it off on some other day and some other other people and and and and other families and other churches and other situations but Lord what does this word mean to us individually today I pray father that you would just break this this bread of life open to us fresh once again Lord that you would just speak to us that you would bring us a little higher in your word father we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen this morning I would like to speak on exactly what we read there seeing a sign God bless you this morning you may be seated please remember that we have a communion service this evening it's the first time in over a year we won't be having a foot washing here unfortunately but we're going to do everything that we can within our power to remain obedient to the law rendering unto Caesar what's his but giving unto God what's his also it's interesting because we can see churches all around now willing to break the rules and just go forwards and I'll tell you it's a struggle for me it really is I would say pray for me if you don't mind because I really struggle with it is this the place that we take a stand and actually go forwards it could be it could very well be we don't know what will happen in the future I don't know I'm not saying that I'm interested in doing that I don't want to I don't want to bring reproach upon the gospel I believe that what some of these people are doing they're actually potentially bringing reproach upon the gospel because it's not really a spiritual persecution they're not restricting our words they're just restricting gathering together and it's not necessarily exclusive to a church it's about human beings and a virus that's potentially being spread and we'll just see what the Lord has in store that's all I'll say let's pray for one another pray for me that he'll give me the leadership that we need and we'll just see what he'll do you know this morning I want to talk about the message greater than Solomon is here and a lot of the inspiration is from that one in 1964-03 0-6 if you want to know some of the thoughts that are coming but it all kind of goes together and winds up being uh a new thing I'll just read this quote here brother Branham says now we find that he told them that a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs let's just continue on actually we'll read verse 38 but we'll just go on and read write up to verse 45. then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the repeat at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man isn't it interesting that he just has these these words right after this a greater than Solomon is here but verse 43 goes on to say when an unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of the man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation brothers and sisters let's get right to it right now we could sing a couple songs and go home don't seek after a sign you know it's interesting it sounds simple and and Elementary that I'd be saying that but I think it's important and I just believe the Lord brought me here I saw something happen recently and it's just been on my heart it's grieved me and I mentioned it to a brother but I I I I didn't know what to do with it and and I've seen it and I know that everyone around us has seen it to one degree or another I heard I heard that there is a group of people who are praying to their Pastor they're praying in the name of their pastor in this world today to believe the message of the hour so-called and you know sometimes I don't think we need to pray in the name of our pastor to actually exalt him to Lord status there's other people that are exalted to that level and you know it's terrible but what does it what causes it what's the root cause of it and and I just I've had this on my heart and so I I just felt led to go this way I believe it's because people seek after a sign people want to see the power of God manifest in in their life and we could say this way they want to see god with skin on and you know it's dangerous because Satan can impersonate any gift of God we don't want to seek after a sign we heard what Jesus said here reading about this but we're going to go a little further and dig into what the prophet said about this this thing about people getting exalted in this world there is nobody to exalt in this world except for Christ if there is a man who is a preacher who is a minister who is a leader he is a servant and if he's not a servant then he's in the wrong position he's got it wrong but I I wonder this really bothered me about this brother to see that people would actually be praying in his name and claim to believe the message of the hour how could that be but then there's other people that exalt other Ministries other men who maybe don't even Minister but but they just exalt them to such a high level high degree how could it be all around the guise of the message and how could they continue on doing that and then there's other parts of the message that aren't afraid to just come to the pulpit and just slam Hammer those people just come right up to him and call them out by name and and slam them to the ground and we know that the I and I believe this with all my heart the intention isn't to slam the person it's to slam the spirit to call the spirit out and discern it happens is people's lives get slammed and so I here I am standing here looking at this observing it just grieved in my heart how on Earth can it be such extreme one-way and such extreme the other way what are we coming to what causes it I believe it's because people seek a sign people look at the message of the hour and they say well William Branham he had he had a Healing Ministry and and if we believe the message of the hour then we should be able to just see a lightning bolt Healing Ministry in our midst and if we don't see that then maybe we just don't have the message of the hour the way that brother Branham brought it but I'm here to tell you brothers and sisters you do have the message of the hour the way William Mary and Branham brought it and it's not to seek after a sign is to seek after the word that's what brother Branham taught the word we have the word in its fullness but if we're seeking after a sign then you know what we're an evil and adulterous generation and that's what drives people to go this way and to behave this way maybe somebody came up in a prayer line and had hands laid on them and and they got prayed for and they got healed instantly and then they started to jump around and praise God and don't doubt for a second that that's not possible because that's entirely possible in fact I would expect to see that happen right here in Calgary but that's not the Vindication of the word that's not what we're after we're after the ability to receive the word to say that we have the fullness of the word to say that yes indeed there is a shout yes indeed there is a voice and where is that voice today brothers and sisters bring it right on down home that voice had better be in the bride that voice had better be in each one of our lives and if it's not we need to check up our experience make sure that we're in line with the message of the hour we don't want to get caught up in following a man if we're doing that brothers and sisters we're going to lose we're not going to wind up in the right location our GPS is skewed if we are following a man because the man that we many people would say we claim to follow he pointed to Christ but you know what happens and I just love how brother Branham how he just makes it so clear you know one of his quotes here he says that evil and lazy generation the word says adulterous but the prophet said lazy why do you think he said that many people would say oh it's just a mistake no there's no mistake he said it for a purpose that was an anointed servant of God preaching a word for a season and you know what it is it's lazy because people don't want to do the work for themselves it's easier just to follow a man and say well well he said that and and you know I'm going to go and stand before God someday and and say that that man told me to just go and jump off the cliff God that's what he told me to do he was your servant he had great signs and wonders God's not going to say oh okay don't worry it's fine you followed the man you you did that and he had great signs and wonders it's not going to be acceptable he's going to say you didn't you didn't follow my word by word was through my Prophet not through any other man not through any other Ministry not through any other way and that Prophet pointed to my word that's all but I had such a a burden on my heart with this when I saw this the one extreme Slam in them the other one saying you know I I I I I I don't know I don't accept it they they pray in in that way and and and yeah I've got a great ministry and I don't have to accept being slammed that way and and God has elevated me and and I am in a certain status what what a what a bunch of nonsense we're all brothers and sisters we're all equal there's no great one amongst us except for Christ Jesus and he is amongst us and the people that behave that way will stand and account for their behavior but you know what brother Branham said I just got into this in our in our study our Revelation study in Revelations chapter 5 part one if you listen to that message I was just listening to it because I was directing my thoughts about Revelations chapter five I wanted to see what the prophet had to say about it I really wanted to dig into it while I had this burden in my heart and if anybody has listened to that message recently I read it you know exactly where I'm going with this but if you haven't I'll tell you brother Branham spends the first 20 minutes of this message explaining why he has to take himself off of the field of ministry in his day do you know why because people were elevating him to Christ so it was an answer for me it was a very clear answer for me these Ministries that are greatly elevated these Ministries that would see people pray in their names these Ministries that would say oh the people do it I don't do it but I don't actually step away from it I don't distance myself from and I just say oh I don't do it and I don't I don't allow them to do it the prophet for our day said I have to close my field office and take myself off the ministry field because you make me an antichrist and I will not allow that to happen to this word because this word is the truth and I will die for this word but because you do that I have to take myself off the ministry and guess what he did we all know he did took himself off the ministry for over a year because people elevated him to that level so what are these other brothers doing I say in the name of Jesus Christ what are these other brothers doing they believe the message of the hour they believe the prophet for our day but why aren't they actually stopping it and the only way that you can stop it that I can see according to what the prophet said is to just separate yourself and I thought what about myself what if I had a great ministry like that and people started to say oh let's pray in the name of brother Barry and and go to that place and it would get that way you know what I would have to do brothers and sisters I'd have to say you know what God has someone else to fill this position here because this is actually distracting the people from Christ it would have to be that way how could I ever think that I could come outside of the pattern that was laid out by the prophet for our day for me it was astounding to look at and for me it was the answer and and I wasn't even searching for it but I had this burden on my heart and you know what that's stuff like that just makes me want to do cartwheels and say thank you Lord because he's that concerned about our lives when we have a problem in our lives brothers and sisters seek the word you might not even know that you're going to find the lightning bolt answer for the question that you have in your heart but if you never open the word if you never press play how will you ever get it we have to do the work ourselves we have to give him the opportunity to speak to us he will speak to us it's through his word he'll speak to us it could be through another Ministry I'm not going to deny that I'm not going to say that you can stream anyone you want to it's just fine but just give him the opportunity give him the license that he desires in your life so that he can speak to you and bring his word or me I just found that astounding I'm just so thankful do you ever get fresh Revelation from God that was for me just this week fresh Revelation from God I just I'm so thankful when he does that it's so incredible the Bradham says now we find that he told them a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs how many times the unbeliever has taken advantage of this about scriptural signs and don't believe it God always speaks with signs he forever has he forever will as long as there's a world he'll still speak by spiritual signs he's foretold they would come you know I've been talking about it the cloud was a sign the cloud was a spiritual sign and we know that that became a a whole thing about a a website and everything to believe the sign and and what a bunch of nonsense that is but we know that an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and that's why all of the rubbish that you would hear there is all about trying to denounce the sign that God gave us which was a prophet for our day someone that would actually bring the Vindication the Vindicated word that we need to get our our bodies changed to get us out of here he says now many of the unbelievers take that when he said a wicked and or a weak and adulterous generation seeks after signs watch he was speaking in a compound prophecy here he was also telling them that they were a weak and adulterous generation and also telling them that any weak and adulterous generation and one that would come would receive a sign we don't want to be a weak an adulterous generation notice he said a weak an adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and nights so must the son of man be in the heart of the Earth for three days and nights and we know that he was both of them were what was he saying here he was saying that a wicked and adulterous generation would receive the sign of the Resurrection but brothers and sisters when that happens it's too late don't seek a sign don't say that when I see an American Pope don't say when I see a a woman dressed in purple don't say when I when I see the mark of the beast don't say when I when I see two prophets in Israel don't seek a sign don't say when I see God move in my life in a certain way no first we have to act then we'll see God the word says to seek ye first the kingdom of God he said and what other age have we ever come to anymore than it is right now to a christ-rejecting wicked perverted adulterous generation and they will receive a sign the sign of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is alive tonight just as much as he ever was he has raised from the dead making him the same yesterday today and forever a weak and an adulterous generation seeks after a sign and they'll get it and the sign will be the sign of the Resurrection now of course he was speaking to them that he would raise up from the dead we don't want to seek after a sign we're going to be sign Seekers we want to see the move of God in our lives but don't let the sign of God's wondrous grace and mercy be the sign that's going to move us because if that's what we're looking for we've missed it we've missed the entire point of it what we're looking for is our ability to receive the word for our day that's the true baptism of the Holy Spirit not being able to lay our hands on the sick and seeing them recover even though that happens not being able to drink any deadly thing and having it not harm us not being able to raise from the dead though we will it's none of that it's being able to receive the word for our day being able to receive the token being able to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you know when we get to that place then it just becomes a place of rest not laboring not trying to promote or or do you know the only sign that this generation will see is a rapture and a resurrection and by then only the people who actually have the token we'll see it there might be some who actually observe it from a different perspective who wonder what happened to all the people that used to come to church here did they go and start their own church somewhere we know that in the Days of Elijah and Elisha the sons of the prophets they said let's send men and go and see where Elijah went because he must have gone somewhere he had to have gone somewhere and Elisha the prophet told them no no no he's gone but you see they couldn't actually understand The Changing of the Guard they couldn't understand the blending of the ages they couldn't understand the moving of the scepter they couldn't understand the moving of the voice going from one man to the other and that's where we're at today brothers and sisters is that the moving of the voices happen now the voice has gone from being in the prophet to being in the bride the many membered body the ones who actually have the Holy Ghost in their lives and speak the word and and these other people that we see it's it's it's troubling to look around and see people get elevated to any other level than brother or sister we have to be careful we don't want to elevate any Ministry any Ministry that is after Christ would say don't talk about me talk about Christ worship Him we know that twice in the Book of Revelations John fell down to worship that guide that he had in heaven and he said see thou do it not don't worship me I'm of thy fellow Brethren thy servants worship God so where do these other people actually find themselves today how on Earth could that possibly be it's terrible but the random goes on to say in this message that scripture has a compound meaning it's real important to understand that too I believe that scripture has a compound meaning so when we talk about this evil and adulterous generation in Jonah's day we can look forward and and see it in our day and know that there are people that seeks after a sign and you know maybe inside a message church people there isn't a great move for people to seek after a sign but maybe there is I believe there is in certain circumstances because people are actually elevating men to levels that they shouldn't be they really are and I think the further that we go down this road the more that we're going to see that and it's troubling I'm not trying to promote them I'm not saying go look at them I'm just saying that we don't want to seek after a sign don't look for a sign look for the Vindication of the word in your life look for God to give you fresh Revelation because he will if we give him the opportunity brother Branham in this message he says that scripture has a compound meaning many times scripture has its common or its compound meaning like in Matthew 3. it's said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt I called my son now if you refer that back it's to Hosea and he prophesied that out of Egypt he called God's son which was Israel Jacob was God's son and he called him out of Egypt that's where the reference runs you to but also Christ was his greater son and he called him out Israel being a type and so that being a type of rejecting Christ in that generation this is a greater type for that generation that rejected the resurrection had pardoned but this generation who makes fun of the Holy Ghost is impardonable to think about that just want to read that again for that generation that rejected the resurrection had pardoned but this generation who makes fun of the Holy Ghost is impardonable I'll say it a few times as we go this morning be very very very careful what we say about a brother or a sister because we don't know if that's God or if that's the devil working through them we don't want to say that the work of God the work of the Holy Ghost and a brother or sister's life is actually of the devil that they're wrong because it could easily be God moving in their lives and if we want to take an example of that let's look at that backslider Jonah I'll just throw it out there like that and I'll stop I just want to continue reading here there's just more in this quote I'll just read this again though for that generation that rejected the resurrection had pardoned but this generation who makes fun of the Holy Ghost is impardonable where greater is he that rejects the Holy Spirit than he that rejects Jesus Christ in the days of his flesh on Earth Jesus said so you speak the son of man when they said he was a fortune teller or some evil spirit said you speak against the son of man it shall be forgiven you but whoever speaks a word against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven them in this world that is called the working of the Holy Ghost an evil unclean thing when they see the work of God being done there's people that do that in our day now you might say well you just said that about brother so and so or whoever the other Ministries are that you're referring to and you know what I I'm not saying that I trust that they're on the move of God but the thing I am saying is it troubles me that they would allow people to magnify them to elevate them to a certain level where they're actually being worshiped and not separate themselves from it that's up to God to discern but brothers and sisters just I'm just saying beware it's around us we can see it it's alive and it's not the right way I'll say it that way but to look at a brother or sister and say they're wrong be careful be careful it could be the holy ghost moving in their lives we don't want to ever ever overstep we want to be cautious when we're speaking about our brothers or our sisters you know when Jonah he was sent to the people of Nineveh people say that that guy was a backslider that he was backslidden brother Branham said that he was in the will of God can you imagine that haven't God tell you to do something and you just go and do something totally different oh my imagine how he must have felt he must have felt like a backslider because he said in the midst of that storm just by my hands and my feet throw me overboard I'm done did he know that there was going to be a fish there to submarine him and take him away in the midst of the tumultuous storm just behind my hands and my feet because then I know that I won't be able to swim and I know that I'll sink like a rock I won't be able to save myself and I don't deserve to be saved that's probably what was in his heart I am I'm a horrible horrible man I know that God called me I know that I'm a minor Prophet I know that he sent me and I just I just deny it and and I just went this way and now I've brought this reproach upon this entire ship and everyone that's on it and everyone could potentially perish at my mistake so just bind me up and throw me overboard I am a filthy Sinner and you know what all the church around him would have said the same thing wouldn't they have they would have said he's just terrible look at that guy look what he's brought upon everyone how could he do that to the body of Christ throw him overboard let him perish but this is a man who is in the will of God is what the prophet said many people tried to condemn Jonah and say oh he everybody he was a Jonah how many times have we ever heard that he was a Jonah I've been a Jonah or or or they're a Jonah they're running from God oh everybody he was a Jonah Jonah was a prophet he was walking exactly in the will of God how can we look at something like this hear the prophet say that and not believe in predestination not believe in the foreknowledge of God God knew exactly what he would do when he asked him to go there and he knew exactly when he would do it so he created the exact circumstances that he would need he created a fish that would be there at the exact moment that he needed to be to catch his prophet and save him and get him to go and actually begin to to to write down the the message that he did which would which would create the the story that we heard even though while he had we've heard the story told many times where he was in the in the belly of the whale and probably dealing with all the stomach bile and all the nasty stuff down there and and and seaweed wrapped around his neck and his eyes and his face and the circumstances that was all around him remembering that he ran from God not understanding what was going on why he wasn't dead yet his hands were bound and his feet was bound inside this this fish in the ocean and he wasn't dead yet but what did he say that all of this is lying vanities if I can just look towards the temple once again and just worship then I know that God will save me he had that in his heart there was that one part of him that there was just no way that that could change his resolve nothing could change that from him it was his innermost core my but then look at it how the entire city the sign we're talking about the sign today signs how perfect God is in everything that he does so this man who is running from God who is maybe potentially a backslider though the prophet said he was perfectly in the will of God he was swallowed by a fish and then he was sent back to Nineveh the people of Nineveh where did the fish spit him up it was on the beach in front of Nineveh what did the people of Nineveh worship fish right and so had he not backslidden had he not ran away and been swallowed by a fish they never would have received him right we know this is what the prophet taught but I just wanted to bring it out here but they worshiped a fish it was their very Idol that brought them the word for their day it's amazing to think about how Sovereign God is and then if we just fast forward through it all I don't want to spend a lot of time there this morning but just to bring it out a little bit what happened the city received the profit they received the word of God and they'd followed the instruction they repented they received the word and they repented and they were saved and that's why Jesus was saying that you know an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign we know that the the Pharisees and the Sadducees were coming at Jesus that day saying oh Master would you just please work a miracle for us just show us something that that that you are who you say you are or that at least who the people say you are and what did he say to them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and what does the men of today who are actually becoming elevated to those places come to what do they do they might just do it they might just say well stick around a little while and and and you'll see do they say to the people that an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and if that's what you're looking for then I've got to take myself off the field I can't stand behind the pulp and administer this gospel anymore because what it's doing is leading people away from Christ and leading them to me I don't know I personally believe it should be but what was the message that he was given to give to the people of Nineveh repent just repent just get right with God throw away your Idols smash all of the things that you think you know your traditions and everything cut down the high places get rid of the Groves smash everything to bits and just get oil in your lamps follow the word of the Lord for your day and they did and it's interesting because this man that was in the will of God he actually was upset because they repented in the end it's so bizarre but it's God's way you know still today people would judge him and say that he was he was outside of God's will but thanks be to God for a prophet in our day that would just bring clarification for this stuff and make it understandable for us that we would see God has a plan for every one of our lives and many times Our Lives can seem like they're just twisting spiraling out of control and maybe somewhere along the way we're going to think back and say where did I backslide what did I do you know what God's doing he's just bringing us to a place where he can use us he wants to get all of the us out of us and once he does that then he's going to take us and use us in a mighty way and I believe it brothers and sisters we sang that song this morning but do we really believe that song I surely hope we do but I hope the Lord would just make it so clear to us that we are that generation we're the ones that he chose to take and share this word with how many people in this world haven't heard of the message of the hour it's probably seven point eight nine billion people I looked it up and there's 7.9 billion people in the world today I thought it was only 7.5 billion people 7.9 billion people probably by this time next year it'll be eight billion people it's growing at such an exponential rate it's amazing he's chosen us to be the voice the final voice to the final age some people would say oh no that was only William Mary and Branham but if that's the case then we have missed the entire point of the message of the our brothers and sisters he brought a message and that message was for Christ to take a bride of his own choosing and she has been given the word the entire word and she her the female the bride of Christ will simply say the same thing that Mary said just be it unto me according to Thy word let that seed come into my womb and actually manifest Let It Grow and when that happens in the life of a Believer then the old person dies it takes a while it doesn't happen right away but that life begins to grow when when when when the bride who has received that seed she begins to nourish that seed she feeds it with the word of God she presses play she comes to church she worships the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit only feeds on the Holy Spirit when that Holy Spirit seed has been planted inside a human being when that seed gets watered by the things we've just described brothers and sisters there's a new life that comes forward inside that person and the old person dies out and if we don't feed that seed then the old person still might live and then you wind up with two heads we know that James said that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and that's what he was referring to the old man's still alive that old man still keeps coming back and and still keeps coming back and still keeps coming back we've got to kill him how do we kill him how do we kill him brother Barry I'll tell you how you kill him feed on the word we talked about it on Wednesday just like a really lushly grown grass many times they don't even put weed treatment on that grass they just nourish the grass they fertilize the grass they water the grass they cut the grass and every once in a while there's a weed that pops up and they can just get rid of it but they don't have to go and combat weeds every day they're focusing on for feeding the grass nourishing the grass and what happens is it chokes out all the weeds the weeds have nowhere to grow it's the same thing in a life of a Believer if we just fill our lives with the word of God if we fill our lives with the message of the hour if we fill our lives with prayer and songs singing in our hearts continually making Melody unto the Lord then all of the stuff of the world just grows strangely dim it just starts to fade away and we just will think one day why didn't I like to used to watch that show all the time it just doesn't do it for me anymore didn't I like do you remember when I used to listen to that music my I'm just a little bit embarrassed by that I hope many people don't remember that you know these things happen in our lives they just Begin to Fall Away brothers and sisters it's not even something that we do and that's why it's so important to recognize it's not something that we do it's not a sign we can't go and do this on our own we have to allow the Lord to do it but when he does it he does it right he does it all the way there's no going back look at Abraham and his life just one one thing and I I I trust it's okay I'm not meaning to throw off on people characters in The Bible but Abraham remember he was a liar he lied twice to save his own hide but what did God say to that man who was backslidden down in Egypt right he lied while he was there to save his own hide but he said you know what God Said to the King give him back his wife and he said oh you know the Integrity of my heart I would never go and do that he said that's why I'm telling you give him back his wife and then when you do get my Prophet to pray for you get that liar to pray for you and I'll accept his prayer on your behalf God is sovereign we don't ever want to say that God should be or shouldn't be a certain way he's only obligated to be by his word and we have to judge the actions that we see in this life by his word that's our compass in Matthew 12 42-45 he talks about the queen of the South and how desirous she was to come and see the wisdom of Solomon how she was taught the message of the hour in her day in a foreign land how she was taught that there would be Messiah just like the woman at the well she was taught that there would be Messiah these these these ladies had had an understanding something had told them that there would be the great one would be in our midst and and she desired to come and hear more about the wisdom of Solomon how could he have such wisdom because he didn't speak of himself he spoke about someone greater he spoke about the God of Israel and he talked about him in many different ways but she knew about this and she desired you know brother Brown I mean really explains it in this message that I'm not going to get too far into it today but he he really takes the time to explain how dedicated she was to come and hear the Solomon wisdom the wisdom that God gave Solomon we know that was the only thing that Solomon asked God said what would you desire and he said I just want wisdom and God said okay you could have it and he gave him the greatest wisdom no man has ever been as wise as Solomon and ever will be I think is what the word says but this man Solomon had such great wisdom and she desired to hear it and so she went she put away all of her stuff and said I'm gonna go I'm going to go and learn about this man but you know what Jesus said she will rise up in judgment against this generation why because a greater than Solomon is standing right before you the greatest sign that you shall ever see is standing right before you right now right before your very eyes and you're missing it brothers and sisters just to fast forward today the greatest sign that we're ever going to see is the opening of the word that's the greatest sign that we're ever going to see don't think that we're going to see some great other healing campaign or great Revival or or great anything because we've seen the greatest the greatest sign is the opening of the word to our day and that's it not a healing campaign not not to see you know and it's fantastic to look back and see it all the stuff that we've heard about in South Africa someone was talking about it recently and and how many truckloads of of canes and crutches and stretchers and wheelchairs did they haul out in in South Africa when brother Bradham was there and and they had all those people marching down the street and I think they said to him brother Branham take a look out the window and see this here all the people who are lame and and withered and halt were now marching down the street saying and only believe that's a great sign but that's not the greatest sign the greatest sign is the opening of the word but what's what's just as great as that brothers and sisters this is really where it gets down to the rubber meets the road this is what we call the brass tax what's what's just as great as that greatest sign just as great is the ability to receive it understanding the greatest sign is the opening of the word is one thing but if we don't use it if we don't accept it if we don't take it as a pardon as a pardon is offered to us then what good is it it's a pretty good sign it's fantastic but it's got to be for a certain generation The Chosen generation there's got to be a people that say hey man I'll just accept that I'll take it just exactly the way it says it and I don't understand it but I'll take it you know brother Bradham he had the first two polls of his ministry and I think that in the message of the hour just what I've seen is almost like if we don't see the same exact manifestation that brother Branham saw in his healing campaigns in our own lives then somehow we've missed it but no you haven't missed it if you don't just lay your hands on someone and see them rise up and and get well and so on it doesn't mean that you haven't received the word for your day because the greatest sign that we have is the opening of the word for our day we know brother Branham had the first two polls and they were the bait that's what was said I believe it was brother Bosworth that said it to brother Branham someone said that it was the bait on the end of the hook and the reason for it was so that people could actually be listening now to this prophet's Ministry now they've actually got the attention the prophet has the attention the Lord has the attention of the people through the prophet through the sign but it wasn't that that wasn't the message the message was the voice behind the sign the message was come out of her my people and be ye not partakers of her sins come out of the church denominations and come up just a little higher come into Christ but you know it was when he sat down and started to declare that that they said oh no no no no this guy's just gone off he's gone off he's not following the traditional teachings of of of the denominations how could we ever do that he's not willing to be a part of The ecumenical council there's no way that it could actually be of God but that's the same exact thing going right back to our scripture this morning master show us a sign we would that that thou would just give unto us a sign you know the one brother said to brother batam this might be blind and he said how could I you already are remember we talked about spiritual blindness people can be blind we could completely miss the moving of God in our lives if we're not carefully in tune with the word for our day it was the third poll that brother Branham gave and that was simply this the opening of the word just the opening of the word to us not a great sign not a great Wonder not not the raising of the dead and the healing of the sick and and the casting out of devils all of those things happen all of those things we we will if God permits but you know what let's move on to perfection let's get into Christ let's get all the way into knowing the ABCs are in place the foundation is set so that we can move into algebra we can move into the the higher way of thinking the the greater Revelation and really what is that greater Revelation it's that I am my father are one and that's where they wanted to Stone Jesus and that's where the shuck will pull away from the seed in our day remember the seed doesn't fall away from the shock it's the opposite the shuck pulls away from the seed that sign was given just before Sodom was judged sorry there was a sign that was given just before Sodom was judged and we know what sign that was discernment of the heart and and that was clearly given in our day the first and the second pull and what was that to usher in the third pole Ministry it was to usher in the identification according to the word of the son of man Ministry to show the world the son of man is back it's not just a cloven lick of fire over top of the heads of people it's not just an Azusa Street Revival it literally is the coming of the son of man and now where is he brothers and sisters it's a many-membered body remember that's why we need to be very careful don't stumble at the flesh don't so and so and my sister so and so say it's the Lord Jesus Christ you know we say it many times when we come and we'll have a communion foot washing and we'll wash one another's feet remember that we're washing one another's feet do we remember that when we're having a conversation around the dinner table about our brother or sister is it the same way because it better be when we're driving with our family in a car and and brother so-and-so or sister so and so are we having that same conversation we need to make our yay and our nay nay we we don't want to be double-minded we want to have the exact same testimony we have in church at a foot washing that our communion table where we take such reverence for it that we would when we talk about a brother or a sister because we could potentially be talking about the Holy Ghost in their lives and what did we say earlier brother Bradham said careful careful we know the word says it that you know what in this day it's okay if you speak against the son of man when you talk about Jesus if they want to go off on him and say that he's a quack from wherever then they can they can just say that but don't ever talk one word against the Holy Ghost when he comes and here we are at the highest level the opening of the word the full word completely open to us brothers and sisters don't let traditional teaching don't let family tradition don't let Church tradition don't let anything get in the way and say because we've done it this way all along it's okay and and we still Prosper it's not going to be okay we need to see the exact representation of the word in our lives to get the results we're after if we want to see a body change we have to be fully committed fully persuaded all the way in before Sodom was judged there was there was there was a sign given and that sign was the discernment of the heart the sermon of the heart the the idea in in the heart of a man and we know that was that was manifested by Sarah Jesus in in in I say Jesus but but Elohim standing there in flesh which is Jesus saying why did Sarah laugh who was in the tent behind him and she said no I didn't laugh and he said oh but you did you did I heard you I was standing right in front of you when you did even though she was an attempt behind him because we know that he is God almighty and he is omnipotent he's everywhere all at the same time omnipresent he knows what's going on but the discernment of the heart and we've seen that in our day I mean maybe we haven't it's it's so far in the past for many of us some of us have seen it in our day I think brother meno and and some of the you know the the old-timers the elders in our our are calling our message Community they actually were in the services brother Pete Claussen he was there in Jeffersonville watching the discernment of the Lord in people's lives son of man Ministry is with us now brothers and sisters remember gifts and callings are without repentance and even though some men have great Ministries a great ministry isn't the sign that we're after we need to be careful and remember that a great ministry from a Pulpit isn't the sign necessarily that we're after does that person actually point to Christ or do they draw men unto themselves we have to point men to Christ just because we have great signs and wonders in our lives doesn't mean anything doesn't mean anything Satan can impersonate anything and and just to bring it so so close and make it so clear remember when Jesus was talking to his disciples he was talking to them about having to go to the cross and and his number one man one of his number one number two Guy Peter said to him no I'll never let that happen what did he say get thee behind me Satan because you don't even understand what you're saying we have to be careful what we say take every thought into captivity you know what brother Branham said because you do that to me you actually Elevate me to a place where you actually make me Jesus you make me Christ you make me the Messiah what you're doing is you're making me Antichrist just like that and the people mean well the people are sincere and genuine they really sincerely genuinely want to help and and and see things manifest in a great way they want to see the kingdom of God go further but if they're Askew in the foundational teaching of the word then they're going to be just a little bit off it's not going to end up right it's like shooting a gun if you're just a teeny little bit off or if you shake just a little bit if you breathe just a little bit if your heart beats just a little bit when you're squeezing the trigger of a gun that bullet can be off a long ways when you want it to hit the target that you're holding the crosshairs on people may have great intellect they might have great healings but if they exalt men in our day we're making those men Antichrist and you know the sad part is is that those men they're not actually doing it themselves it's people that are doing it to them but those men have a place of Reckoning where they can actually make a decision to say I need to make a change something has to change here people's souls are on the line personally my opinion here it's not worth much I know it but I believe this that those people need to recuse themselves from the position they're in because they're no longer able to do it with a clear conscience I believe how could we clearly believe the word for our day and have people Elevate ourselves to a different level other than what we are as a servant how could we possibly ever do that with a clear conscience it just doesn't make sense brother Branham set out the pattern he said when you do that to me you make me Antichrist don't want to look for a sign don't look for a sign s and wonders aren't the infallible proof of the word in our lives the infallible proof of the word in our lives are being able to receive the word for our day being able to receive the message of the hour being able to receive the formula that the message of the hour gave us and that's to go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know harping on the Holy Ghost is important because without the Holy Ghost we're going to miss the Mark we're not going to have that token in our lives to get to where we want to I know some people have been upset oh he's talking about the Holy Ghost again my goodness there's nothing else but the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters there isn't and I would say this be careful because there's one thing you don't want to speak against one thing grown about any other topic that we talk about but don't groan about that one that's the only way of Escape that we have how could anybody groan about that topic it just blows my mind doesn't it when you think about it that way as a Believer we have one way to get out of here one thing that's going to get us in a Rapture or get us out of the graveyard one thing and that's the Holy Ghost in our lives but some people will complain about the preaching of the Holy Ghost why brother Bradham once he realized at first he thought this was a joke these people elevating them that way he thought that he says it in this message at first he thought this was a joke but then he heard that it was real and you know this is the one thing that really stood out to me from this whole entire topic brother Branham when he realized that it wasn't a joke it grieved him it grieved him really bad and why did it grief him he says it it grieved him because these are true believers these are genuine brothers and sisters these aren't fanatical Maniacs out there causing reproach for the gospel these are people that really believe and he said it Grieves my heart to think that they would do that because of that I have to excuse myself from it I cannot allow them to do that I have to just step back and say no not me Christ and you know I believe this with all my heart I just again here I go getting into Muddy Waters but what stops people from doing that what would stop someone from actually saying I'm just going to excuse myself because I don't believe that you're actually promoting me the right way we're not actually doing the right thing we're not getting the right results because you're talking about me and you're not talking about Christ what stops people from stepping back is pride why wouldn't somebody say I'll step back you know what I I and I'm sure every one of us would have the same idea in our minds that if someone truly was led by God and that started to happen God would make a way for them God wouldn't take them out and hang them to dry he would say no I'm going to pour out a blessing upon you that you can't even contain because you have defended the word you have stepped back and and humiliated yourself humbled yourself before me and before the people but it takes a lot of anti-pride to be able to do that to be able to step back and say wow maybe there's someone else that would be the person for this position brother Brown thought it was a joke at first but once he realized it it grieved him you know the other part about this is he said to people that actually do this they will be responsible for all the people that he can't reach because of it it's tragic to think about to think today the people that actually do that to those other brothers out there ever who they are I don't know I'm not going to say anybody I'm not going to throw off on anybody if you ever see it if you ever come across it you'll know what I'm talking about but those people that do that and the brothers that don't do something about it they're going to be responsible for who this message doesn't reach because it's the prophet speaking here I believe this is a prophecy here now maybe I'm crazy but this is a prophet speaking these words right here he also said that the people who do this will be responsible for the people that he fails to reach so the people who fail to actually hear true preaching of the message of the hour from a minister brothers and sisters who would say the truth instead of saying oh my pastor my pastor my pastor my pastor or this Minister this Minister this minister I remember hearing somebody say to me one time we were in Africa and and it kind of put me on the floor I didn't understand it at the time but I I did later on a couple of sisters came to me after some of the services the Easter meetings on the very first time we were there and they said oh brother we sure appreciated your preaching and it was so good and we were so inspired by it are you a follower of so and so are you a disciple of so and so and I was like what disciple of who I didn't even know who the brother was I had to go away and look them up online and see and I was like my goodness no I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ I'm a follower of the Lord I believe the message of the hour that William Miriam Branham Brent and and brought and what it did was it gave me the opportunity to have a real relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and that's who I follow I don't disciple any Ministry no and I think it's a real big trap for people to do that to get into the school of the prophets and and try and go down that road and think that if no no no no no no we've been given clear unreserved access to the throne of almighty God and if we go any other way we're going to miss the mark don't follow brother Branham don't don't talk about brother Bradham talk about Jesus Christ because brother Branham pointed to Jesus Christ we follow the lord Jesus Christ any other way is going to be wrong now don't get me wrong don't take it out of context and I said it that way I know I did I'll just go back and correct it a little bit here try and smooth it over Maybe cover my tracks a bit and just simply say this yeah I know I said don't follow brother Branham but if you follow just the man guess what's going to happen you're going to elevate him Antichrist in your life that's what I'm saying follow his instructions his instructions were follow Christ his instructions were go on all the way to the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and anything else is going to be false anything else won't be accepted in our day that's what I'm saying that's what I'm talking about right there nice throw away your Traditions don't follow traditional teachings of man he said that the people who actually do this that elevate him that way they will be responsible for the people that he can't reach to think about the ministers today if if they don't do something about it if they don't stop that thing however they can because of Pride or whatever it is maybe it's money maybe it's popularity whatever it is if they don't stop that thing in their own life in their own Ministry then they will be responsible for who this message doesn't reach in their day that is powerful my I'm just so thankful that the Lord showed me this Antichrist is what it is and you know that spirit is alive and well today I'm just going to stop harping on that now who seeketh after assigned brothers and sisters after what we've heard so far an evil and adulterous generation brother Branham our Prophet for today he said a lazy generation seeketh after a sign and a lazy adulterous generation they want someone else to do it for them they want that great minister to be in there and and to make a certain amount of money and and to do a certain amount of things and and to create a certain way for them to actually just be able to fellowship and you know what brother Branham said is that yeah God will actually allow his anointing to bless that Ministry maybe not in those words that's Barry's words for sure but you know brother Bradham said in the last days they'll actually trade power for programs and they'll get a great church together and and they'll have all of the great signs and wonders in the church and he even said brother Bradham did say this that they'll get results they'll get results so what could be wrong with it if it's not pointing to the right word the right sign if it's not pointing the right way if it's not pointing people to Christ then it's wrong then it's Antichrist and you know remember the word says that it will be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible the two Vines grow together all the way together so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so don't think that vine is somewhere out there in the world it's right there in the midst right in the midst of the truth we need to be very careful we have to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters that's the only way the Holy Ghost is the only way we're going to be able to discern it to be able to tell the difference between truth and false to think that that's the only way we're going to be able to tell the difference between the true and the false Vine that's the only way we're going to be able to get out of the Grave if we go there that's the only way we're going to be able to get in the Rapture if we're here when it happens is the only way we're spiritually going to be able to accept God in spirit and Truth is with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives how could we ever not want to talk about the Holy Ghost that just blows my mind to Smithereens I just I don't even understand that I don't even get it we've been given the greatest sign brothers and sisters if we believe if we are able to believe the word for our day out of 7.9 billion people only how many people are able to hear the word for our day even if it was a million people that's a really small small percentage but is it a million people I don't know I don't know how many people is it in the world nobody knows that's why we don't want to put anybody in we just want to try and get as many people to come with us as we can we just want to make sure that we preach what the prophet preached and never deviate from it and never allow something to come up where we say that no I've gone so far this way that I can't have enough humility in my spirit to come back and say forgive me because maybe I was wrong we have got to be willing to say that I was wrong we've got to be able to say it as as as parents to our children we have to be willing to say it children to our parents we have to be willing to say it husband to wife and wife to husband pastor to sheep sheep to Pastor brothers and sisters we're in this together it's a many-membered body it's not a great one amongst us except for Christ Jesus we've got to be willing to have humility in our lives if we're wrong we don't want to be wrong who wants to be wrong I'll tell you who wants to be wrong the person that never wants to be wrong the one who's always right right they're the one that wants to be wrong and they don't even realize it but nobody wants to be wrong I honestly believe that nobody really wants to be wrong but you know what happens is pride gets in the door pride gets in our lives and it causes us to always want to be right I always have to be right and I can have all the quotes and I could have all the scripture I could I could give my body to be burned I could spend all the money that I get I could stay up all night long praying I could use toothpicks to keep my eyes open for a week I could fast for 40 days I could do all of these things but if I don't have what the Holy Ghost it profareth me nothing it's not a workspace gospel it's having that true baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you have to have it we have to obedience to the message of this hour is what entitles us to the Token that's what brother Branham said obedience to the word full obedience to the word entitles you to the token what else is there besides the token I I just don't understand it there's nothing it's divine love we only get Divine love with the token which is the Holy Spirit you know what the same anointing though that anoints the people with the Holy Spirit is anointing other people it's the exact same anointing God poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh is what the word says and that anointing is causing Christians to rise up and and become bride and accept the word and and become exactly who God created them to be and it's also causing the other seed to rise up and become exactly what God created it to be some vessels of honor and some vessels of Dishonor all of it was created by God we know that Eve said she got a man from the Lord and who was that Cain Cain who was of his father the devil but all life brothers and sisters comes from God any life that's created on this Earth is from God everything that was created here is what the word says but there's a lot of people who are anointed with the very same Holy Spirit today and it's causing them to display a different Revelation and and you know it's an antichrist Spirit we talked about it in the in the in the church ages in the seals dealing with all of those different things it's that same Antichrist spirit that gallops all the way through it it's the same Holy Ghost spirit in the seven Church ages even in the seals that actually displays the spirit of Christ it's the same spirit and they too they're just intertwined they're together so close that it would deceive the fairy elected and and who we give who you know remember the story brother Branham talked about the two dogs in in a man's life the Indian Chief's life the white dog and the black dog which one wins the one that he feeds the most right it's the same thing in our lives brothers and sisters those those two Spirits are striving for for a place in our lives they're striving for the throne room of our hearts and the one that we feed is the one that will actually reign in our heart and if we're Sons and Daughters of God there's nothing that can ever take that place nothing can ever ever satisfy that thirst in our lives so I'm not trying to scare anyone don't worry if we're a Son of God then we will be a Son of God and there's nothing that can stop us from being a son or a daughter of God nothing because when that anointing strikes us at the time appointed of the father we will take the necessary steps to get the baptism of the holy spirit in our lives that's the only thing that's going to save us you know when we look around the world it's frightening they're teaching it's okay to just teach students in school that you can just be whatever you want to be and if anybody like me stands behind a Pulpit and says you know what according to the word of God that's wrong Man was created man woman was created woman period to say that man was created as a man and a woman was created as a woman and they too shall become one is marriage and anything else is against the word of God those two things are called hate speech and it's written into law now and that's the thing that will shut us down that's what will get us in trouble with the law but it is the word of God and we're not going to deny it you know what happens is that anointing it hits that seed Gene that was placed there from before the Foundation and when it does it just activates that life that life comes to life and some people they have it in their in their mother's womb right some people come out and they're just good people and and they just they get the baptism of the Holy Spirit I know a brother was saying that he remembers clearly at age three he wanted to go up to the front of the church and get the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost at age three he can remember it and his parents validate it some people they go to age 33 like me some people go further everyone has the time appointed of the father and if we are that see Gene of God then we will come we will every age has been given a portion of this heavenly gift and you know what's interesting when we look at it that way every age has been given a portion right that's what I said every age has been given a portion but we have been given all of it what should that do for us we love the word for our day it's just astounding to look at and think about turn with me over into Matthew chapter 19. Matthew chapter 19. someone else was seeking after a sign start with verse 18. I was talking to this the Commandments Verse 18 He saith unto him which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself verse 20. Matthew chapter 19. the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what luck I yet Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be perfect remember the word let's move on to perfection when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with here we have the sign for the day giving this Man instruction if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who can then be saved but Jesus says Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible so the point that I want to make out with this here is this actually you know what let's just turn over to Luke 16 quickly we got 15 minutes Luke chapter 16. continuing on with this story Luke chapter 16 verse 22. I'll just read the end of this here but Jesus beheld his disciples I'll read 25 we'll return in there when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but With God all things are possible in Luke 16 Verse 22 and it came to pass actually verse 19 sorry there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus was in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and said Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this Flame what son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth die good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this you there is a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would Ascend him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they would repent and he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded by one that rose from the dead brothers and sisters just thinking about this whole story here how important it is even the sign of someone coming back from the dead if that seed Gene of God is in them then this word this word about the Holy Ghost is all that it takes this word of the message of the hour understanding how to get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is all it will take it's not going to take William Miriam Branham coming back from the dead it's not going to take a dead loved one coming back from the dead to try and persuade us we either get persuaded by the word the true sign for our day or we don't is the point that I want to make with this one other little thing that I want to brush on here in Matthew 20. Jesus saith unto him in verse in in in Matthew 19 sorry in verse 21 Jesus Jesus saith unto him if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions Jesus gave him the instruction he asked for a sign and Jesus gave it to him but you know what it was the things of this Earth were too great for him and and I believe the Lord just revealed this to me myself while I was going through this and you know it wasn't all about the money and it wasn't all about the inheritance from his parents it wasn't all about whatever it was that was there in the background in riches even though he says that it was riches so forgive me I'm not trying to say the scripture is different but what I want to do is look at it from a little different angle I believe that he was telling him something way more important than that and that is that all that you think you know about the word is not what the word actually is of the traditional teaching that you're following you think that it's actually going to stay the same I'm here as a sign a super sign to show you that it's changed dispensations the scepter is moving the voice is gone from Heaven down to earth and it stands right before you now telling you the instruction that you need to do but I know for sure that you won't do it because you can't it's not in you to do it and when we hear the message of the hour brothers and sisters he's calling us out of tradition we have to be very very certain and I just say it and I'll keep saying it make absolutely certain that our tradition matches the word the tradition that we have holds to the message of the hour and if it doesn't then just leave it alone and ask the Lord to show us he will show us when we are sincere I heard someone mention it a little while ago and I I believe it you know what there's one thing that I can say with conviction myself as I wrap up I'll even call the musicians because we have service tonight I could just keep going here and and probably will pick up from where we leave off here but I believe this with all my heart I know it for sure there's one thing that the message of the hour takes if you want to see the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life there's one thing that will get it for you and you don't have to labor into it it's not a great work it's not something big that we have to strive to do it's easy just be sincere remember the prophet he was shown the snake and and God showed him in that Vision you need to be more sincere how much more sincere do we need to be as Sons and Daughters of God not in that prophet's status where maybe many of us have have lives that are marred with different things that that have happened for our day who didn't actually smoke or drink or defile his body in any way because there was a work for him to do later that man was told to be more sincere the person in that office was told to be more sincere but I know this if we're sincere if we truly are if we look up at me I don't even know what the meaning of the word means and forgive me maybe it sounds silly for me even to be talking this way maybe I'll bring it tonight I'll bring the the Webster's definition of the word sincere I Know It with all my heart if you're sincere if you have no reservations if you're willing to say to God just let me come and fall at your altar and and make me a new creation created me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me if we're willing to do that he will but if we have a reservation if we say no I still like all my old friends and I still like all their old phone numbers and I still like that movie and I still like that song and I still like to go there and I still like all these little things in my life you know what we're doing we're saying to God that you're not the pearl of great price not yet and he'll say okay it's cool it's just not the time appointed of the father there's a little bit more training to do and a little bit more hardship to go through a little bit more swamp to Wade through and as we Wade through it we will come to the other side and we have to come out of it brothers and sisters there comes a point in time where our enemy will be dead on the wings of a snow white dove the prophet for our day he lived his entire ministry right to the end fighting that thing in his life but he did come to the place where God told him your enemy is dead same thing for us brothers and sisters don't doubt it don't doubt it nothing can harm us if we're Sons and Daughters of God he has Us in his hand maybe stand with me this morning as we pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for your word we're thankful for your instruction we're thankful for your sign that you have given each one of us Lord you you have shown each one of us yourself in the way that each one of us needs to see it and father I pray that if there's anyone who hasn't actually seen your sign for themselves this morning Lord whether they're here in person or whether they're listening or whether they hear a recording father I pray that you would just show them their sign Lord that they could come to the place of recognition that there is a step for them to take there's one more step that we need to take and that is to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when that happens then we can just rest father I pray that you would just allow each and every one of us to just find that place of rest of perfect rest in you Lord Jesus because that's your desire your desire is to take us out of here your desire is to see your church seated at that heavenly table that place with each one of our place marks with our own name on it that seat that you have reserved for us in your throne Lord Jesus oh Father how we desire to be in that seat but while we're here father we pray that you would just continue giving us strength continue giving us Mercy continue giving us the ability to just press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus because Lord we know that's why you've positionally placed each one of us here it's not so that we can get caught up in this world and and and and and have a career and and have a great name and and try and establish a kingdom down here no no no no no father we're just so thankful that you have given us eyes to see and ears to hear and most importantly a heart to receive your holy spirit so father as we go our separate ways this morning I pray that you would just continue ministering this word continue breaking it open to us Lord continue encouraging us father help us to just have that desire Lord Jesus Take taken and change that thirst for the things that we have in this world for for for for one thing and one thing only and that's for you Lord Jesus I pray that you would bless our service tonight Lord Jesus bless each one father that makes the effort to come out Lord God that we could just remember you in your body and in your blood according to your your direction father we know that it's strange we know that it's different we know that it's it's not the way we would like it to be but father let us make the best of the only thing that we have without breaking the law I pray that you would just minister to each and every one of us father as we take you at your word tonight we just pray that you would be glorified now in a couple songs before we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] it was a sign
