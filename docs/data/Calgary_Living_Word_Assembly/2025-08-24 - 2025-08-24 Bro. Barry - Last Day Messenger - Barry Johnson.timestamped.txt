[36:51] to This song has been on my heart for
[36:54] weeks. I think it was verse two since I
[36:58] met this blessed savior.
[37:01] Man, I was thinking I think is the
[37:04] conversation with my parents where we

[37:08] he was in Africa, where my mom was in
[37:09] Africa coming from the village, the
[37:11] lifestyle they lived or his character
[37:15] before he met this blessed savior. So I
[37:17] started looking at the Bible and I
[37:18] thought of Peter, a man with no
[37:21] education, a rough man, and that he met
[37:23] that blessed savior. Amen. Zakius,
[37:26] everyone didn't like him. a cheating,
[37:28] exploiting tax collector and he met that
[37:30] blessed savior or Paul killed people,
[37:33] hunted people and that he met that
[37:36] blessed savior and that has been on my
[37:38] heart. I had to get that. I'm sorry. I
[37:41] had to. Amen.

[38:00] a Lord of hilts
[38:04] and shame.

[38:11] the hand of Jesus
[38:15] touched me.
[38:19] Oh,
[38:20] and now I can't be no longer
[38:26] the same.
[38:27] [Music]
[38:29] Oh,
[38:31] he touched me.
[38:34] Oh,
[38:42] and
[38:45] the joy

[39:04] he has
[39:07] and
[39:12] since
[39:15] and since
[39:17] I met his plan
[39:22] since he cleansed
[39:25] oh since
[39:27] he cleansed
[39:32] changed our nature.
[39:39] [Music]

[40:32] and made
[40:34] me since he to this blessed savior.
[40:40] Ever since
[40:42] I left this place,

[40:52] This
[40:53] place

[41:38] deaths.
[41:40] What has happened?

[41:45] Something
[41:47] happened
[41:50] and
[41:52] I know

[41:58] and
[42:02] [Music]

[42:16] &gt;&gt; To be able to worship in spirit and in
[42:18] truth. What a tremendous
[42:21] honor and privilege that is.
[42:24] That's the only way that we can worship.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; For him to receive it. If you have a
[42:29] need tonight, maybe just make it known
[42:31] unto him by way of an uplift hand as we
[42:33] go to him in prayer. Just want to
[42:36] remember sister Nancy
[42:38] and uh each and every uplift hand
[42:42] tonight.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[42:45] tonight we're so thankful that you
[42:47] touched us, Lord.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we could never say it enough to
[42:51] you. And Lord, we just pray that you
[42:55] would know our hearts.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Father, tonight one more
[42:59] time, we're so thankful that we can
[43:01] approach you and gather together in your
[43:03] name, Lord.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Because we know that you're here already
[43:07] in our midst.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; And Father, I just can't help but think
[43:11] about the the vision that we don't have,
[43:15] but Lord, sometimes you'll allow to be
[43:19] seen. And I think of the story of Elijah
[43:23] and the minister.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. or maybe it was Elisha and how they
[43:28] couldn't see all of your army
[43:32] surrounding them.
[43:34] They could only see the enemy. And I I
[43:36] think Lord, many times in our lives,
[43:38] that's all we can see is the enemy that
[43:41] stands before us and surrounds us. But
[43:44] Lord, we know that you surround them.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, greater is he that is in me
[43:50] than he that is in this world. We're so
[43:53] thankful, Lord Jesus, that you not only
[43:55] touched us, but that you came to take up
[43:58] your abode on the throne of our hearts,
[44:02] Lord, by a free will offering that we
[44:05] made unto you. And Father, tonight we
[44:07] just lift your name.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to exalt
[44:12] you, Lord.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Tonight, Father, we just want to
[44:15] remember Sister Nancy, Lord, according
[44:17] to the request that was given today.
[44:20] Father, we pray that you would guide the
[44:21] surgeon's hands, that you would enable
[44:24] the situation, Lord Jesus, to change,
[44:28] Father. Lord, we just thank you that we
[44:30] can bring our needs unto you tonight.
[44:32] Lord, we just ask that you would meet
[44:34] the need behind every uplift hand unto
[44:37] you tonight. Father, we know that you're
[44:39] more than able.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, as we go forwards, we
[44:43] pray that you would just be glorified
[44:45] now in all that's said and done. Father,
[44:47] as those two that walked with you on the
[44:50] road to Emmas that night, Father, we
[44:53] pray that you would just break the bread
[44:55] of life to us fresh once again, Lord,
[44:57] that you would open our eyes to your
[45:00] word. We love you tonight, Father, and
[45:03] we thank you. We just ask all these
[45:05] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[45:07] pray.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians one more
[45:12] time for your
[45:15] unfailing service for the body.

[45:19] scriptures that I want to read.

[45:52] It's not that much.
[45:56] Malachi 4, chapter 4
[46:01] of Malachi
[46:03] verse one says, "For behold, the day
[46:05] cometh that shall burn as an oven, and
[46:09] all the proud, yay, and all that do
[46:13] wickedly
[46:14] shall be stubble."
[46:17] Remember that word wickedly is anything
[46:21] contrary to the word of God. Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; One word off
[46:24] &gt;&gt; is wickedly.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; All that do wickedly shall be stubble.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And the day that cometh shall burn them
[46:34] up, sayaeth the Lord of Hosts, that
[46:37] shall leave them neither root nor
[46:38] branch.
[46:40] But unto you
[46:42] &gt;&gt; that fear my name,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; shall the son of righteousness arise
[46:47] with healing in his wings,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[46:52] calves of the stall. Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And ye shall tread down the wicked,
[46:58] &gt;&gt; for they shall be ashes under the souls
[47:00] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[47:04] this, saith the Lord of hosts, because
[47:08] we will have an immortal body when that
[47:11] happens. There will be a body change.
[47:15] Remember ye the law of Moses my servant,
[47:19] which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
[47:22] all Israel, with the statutes and
[47:25] judgments.
[47:27] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[47:30] prophet before the coming of the great
[47:34] and dreadful day of the Lord. Isn't that
[47:37] beautiful?
[47:39] Behold, not I will send the church, I
[47:42] will send the age, I will send the
[47:45] prespit or the pope, but I will send
[47:49] you,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; before the coming of the great and
[47:55] dreadful day of the Lord. Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And he shall turn the heart of the
[47:59] fathers to the children and the heart of
[48:02] the children to their fathers, lest I
[48:06] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[48:10] Now over in Revelation chapter 10,
[48:14] again, as we say, very familiar
[48:16] scriptures,
[48:18] but I just think there's some points in
[48:20] there that really kind of got me
[48:22] inspired. And uh
[48:25] &gt;&gt; here we are. Revelations 10:7, "But in
[48:28] the days of the voice of the seventh
[48:31] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[48:34] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[48:37] hath declared to his servants, the
[48:40] prophets."
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[48:43] Father, we thank you for the days of the
[48:46] voice.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we know that we are in the
[48:50] midst of the days of the voice. And
[48:53] father, we pray that you would just
[48:54] quicken this word to our souls tonight.
[48:57] Lord,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; we just love you and we thank you. We
[48:59] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[49:01] name we pray. Amen. God bless you
[49:04] tonight. You may be seated. This verse
[49:06] in seven of Revelations chapter 10 is so
[49:10] familiar to us. But in the days of the
[49:13] voice, I love the the thought that
[49:16] there's multiple days. It's a plurality
[49:18] of days, but it's a singularity of
[49:22] voice. One voice, one word that's given
[49:26] to us. It's absolutely tremendous. And
[49:30] we know that the mystery of God should
[49:32] be finished through the days of the
[49:36] voice. There should be no more
[49:38] mysteries. So if we have mysteries and
[49:40] and we we are talking about mysteries,
[49:43] then somehow we've missed what this
[49:46] verse actually says. I would like to
[49:50] extend a warm welcome to Sister
[49:52] Michelle. God bless you. Welcome back.
[49:55] It's good to see you.
[49:57] [Applause]
[50:00] She had a a note here. She said, "I just
[50:03] want to thank the congregation for their
[50:04] prayers and thank the Lord for traveling
[50:07] mercies. Everything went smoothly
[50:10] despite near misses in traffic and Air
[50:13] Canada strikes.
[50:15] God is so good."
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can be such a disruptive thing
[50:20] just traveling. It's not an easy thing
[50:22] at all. Brother Mvin taking the service
[50:24] on Sunday. I got to stream it on Monday
[50:27] after we left while we were driving from
[50:30] uh Birch Hills and I hadn't actually
[50:33] been able to connect the dots in that
[50:36] area because I had heard of Birch Hills,
[50:39] I had heard of Weldon and I have heard
[50:41] of Kistano and they're all separate
[50:44] places that are basically really close
[50:47] together. So, uh, the church is in the
[50:50] middle in a place called Weldon. And
[50:53] there's a lot of people that live in a
[50:55] town called Canistano, and there's an
[50:58] egg world and a farm world, a really big
[51:01] farm implement operation that's there.
[51:04] And, uh, many of the believers are
[51:06] there, and some of the believers that
[51:08] have gone on to their reward. Uh, I
[51:10] believe the elder brother Cook was
[51:12] actually a pioneer in that dealership
[51:14] there in the area. And uh yeah, there's
[51:18] a lot of stats with it, but you know,
[51:20] they're just tremendous. I'm not going
[51:22] to try and repeat them all, but I will
[51:23] say this that uh I heard that it was
[51:26] like that dealership was like number one
[51:28] in the world. The number one dealership
[51:31] in the world, and that is pretty
[51:34] significant when you look at the size of
[51:36] the world and all the implements that
[51:38] there are. So, uh I don't think it is
[51:41] now. it's sold and and changed hands and
[51:44] but it's just kind of neat to go and and
[51:46] see everyone there. And you know, while
[51:48] we were talking about it, Lisa had said
[51:50] that it was a bit like a homecoming
[51:52] because we have desired to go there for
[51:54] so many years, for probably as long as
[51:56] we've been married, 19 years. We have
[51:59] talked about going there and not
[52:01] realizing it was really only an hour and
[52:02] a half further than Saskatoon. And uh I
[52:06] was telling everyone there that I think
[52:07] Saskatoon was just where we stopped
[52:10] because there was so many friends and
[52:12] family there. So it just we just didn't
[52:15] make it out there. But it was certainly
[52:16] a tremendous time. We had two services
[52:19] on Sunday and uh you know the morning
[52:21] service was pretty good. I gave a little
[52:23] bit of my testimony and some of the
[52:25] people there had never met me and I was
[52:27] just basically getting to know brother
[52:28] Paul Dirkson and uh the evening service
[52:31] was absolutely tremendous. The Lord came
[52:34] by our way there and uh it was really
[52:37] really good. It was a powerful service.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from brother Paul
[52:42] and sister Holly uh Dirkson, the pastor
[52:47] and his wife of the church in uh in
[52:50] Weldon. It's Weldon Christian
[52:52] Tabernacle.
[52:53] And uh this is a church that is kind of
[52:56] an interesting place because uh some of
[52:58] the elder pioneers in the area, the
[53:01] cooks, my understanding is they were
[53:03] very very close with brother Joseph and
[53:06] with brother Billy Paul. And so there's
[53:09] a big or a strong connection directly to
[53:12] Jeffersonville through those ties. And
[53:16] uh of course with all of that there's a
[53:19] really strong uh contingent for the tape
[53:22] only people and uh you know it is what
[53:25] it is. You can't uh you can't try and
[53:28] persuade someone to do something that
[53:30] they don't want to do. I think the
[53:32] saying goes that uh what is it? A man
[53:36] convinced against his will is of the
[53:38] same opinion still. And uh that's one
[53:41] thing when you have a man or a woman
[53:43] that's that way. But when you're dealing
[53:44] with spirits, it's uh it's totally
[53:47] different level. And you know, that's
[53:49] one of the things that brother Paul
[53:50] Dirkson combats is uh that spirit. It's
[53:53] a very strong spirit in the area. And uh
[53:56] I know we have it everywhere, but you
[53:58] know, the prophet for our day, he did
[54:00] not instruct us to stay at home and
[54:02] listen to tapes,
[54:05] &gt;&gt; period.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; So for someone to say that there's a
[54:08] leadership of the Lord to do that, you
[54:10] know, there's a disconnection somewhere
[54:12] along the way. And you you hate to say
[54:15] that someone is absolutely wrong. You
[54:17] just have to simply say that, you know,
[54:19] the word says this and and the prophet
[54:22] said what the word said and we just say
[54:25] amen to that. I mean, what can you say?
[54:28] Uh they're lovely people and uh we
[54:31] certainly love them and want to
[54:32] encourage them and continue to to be
[54:35] friends with them. So, you know, we just
[54:37] had a wonderful time of fellowship
[54:39] there. It just wasn't long enough. It
[54:41] never is when you get together with
[54:43] brothers and sisters of like precious
[54:44] faith,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Um, we stayed with brother Brent Gransky
[54:50] and his wife, Sister Cheryl, and they
[54:52] gave up their house and their beds and
[54:55] just made us feel right at home and it
[54:56] was just a a real tremendous time. And
[54:58] for those people who remember brother
[55:00] Brent Gransky, he's actually preached
[55:02] here. He uh he got good and saved here
[55:05] in Calgary years ago when this church
[55:08] was actually being held in a community
[55:10] hall down in Southwood. Was it
[55:12] Southwood, Calgary? It was down south
[55:14] anyways, just off of Mloud Trail. And uh
[55:18] you know, there was another minister at
[55:19] the time and so on and so forth. But you
[55:22] know, Brother Brent, he when he was here
[55:24] last time, he went to that community
[55:25] hall and he just went back to that
[55:27] place. It was a tiepost for him where he
[55:30] could say that he gave his heart to the
[55:32] Lord and he knew that God did something
[55:33] for him supernaturally in that moment.
[55:36] And I just think it's so important for
[55:38] us to be able to do that. We have got to
[55:41] have those typos, those places where we
[55:43] can say right there and then something
[55:46] happened for me in my life.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we have never had that, I
[55:50] would recommend, I would implore, I
[55:53] would plead and and even cry, ask the
[55:56] Lord to give you one of those. Because
[55:58] it's so important for a believer. It's
[56:01] almost as important, if not as
[56:03] important, for a believer to have those
[56:06] moments where they can actually go back
[56:08] to and say, "I know that God spoke to me
[56:11] there." Because there nobody can
[56:13] convince you otherwise because you know
[56:15] it was God that spoke to you. So, it was
[56:18] just a wonderful time of of reminiscing
[56:21] with uh Brother Brent and and the
[56:23] believers up there. We had such a
[56:25] wonderful time and as I said, I'm
[56:27] certainly thankful for Brother MVIN
[56:28] stepping in and summarizing the message
[56:30] of the hour. And uh it just got me
[56:32] inspired tonight. And uh even this
[56:34] morning, I I got on the Bible study and
[56:37] they never had a minister and I was
[56:39] barely awake. And so at 6:00 in the
[56:41] morning, they said, "Can you take it?"
[56:43] And I hadn't prepared a thing, but I
[56:46] said, "Amen. let's do it. Let's be in
[56:48] instant in season and out of season. And
[56:51] uh I just went with it. So this is maybe
[56:53] a little bit of what we got into this
[56:54] morning. And it just it just really
[56:56] struck me um listening to the service
[56:58] that Brother Mvin preached because it's
[57:01] been on my heart. And uh you know, did
[57:03] you get the email, brother? We've got
[57:05] it. If you want to bring it up, I'm just
[57:06] going to preach directly from that. If
[57:08] we just go further down in the message
[57:10] out of the Leodysian church age in the
[57:13] church age book um
[57:16] talking tonight about the divinely
[57:18] revealed mystery truths. Uh there's a
[57:21] few different points that I want to make
[57:23] here but I'm just going to start with
[57:24] this one here. Brother Bradam, he says,
[57:26] "So we can well see from these
[57:28] scriptures that the prophet in Malachi
[57:31] 3, who was John, was not the prophet of
[57:36] Malachi 4, though indeed both John and
[57:40] this last day prophet have upon them the
[57:43] same spirit which was upon Elijah."
[57:48] And now I'm just going to pause and say
[57:50] this. There is five comeings of this
[57:53] spirit that I think is very important to
[57:56] just highlight, just point out. And I
[57:59] want to say this as well. I better say
[58:00] this as well. I was thinking about it
[58:02] this afternoon while I was studying. You
[58:03] know, I'm certainly by no any way
[58:06] bringing any correction to Sunday. I say
[58:08] amen to Sunday all along. I just simply
[58:11] got inspired by what was preached. So
[58:14] I'm just chipping in my two cents here
[58:16] if it's okay.
[58:18] We can see that uh these two prophets
[58:20] are not the same.
[58:22] The prophet of Malachi 4, though indeed
[58:25] both John and this last day prophet have
[58:27] upon them the same spirit which was upon
[58:29] Elijah. And as I was saying there before
[58:32] I got distracted by myself, there's five
[58:35] comingings of this Elijah anointing.
[58:37] There is Elijah. There is Elisha. And we
[58:39] know there was a clear delineation. If
[58:42] you see me when I go, you can have what
[58:45] you ask. And we know that he asked, "I
[58:47] want a double portion of what you got."
[58:49] And that's exactly what happened. He got
[58:51] a double portion of it. And then the
[58:53] next anointing of that spirit was in
[58:56] John the Baptist. And the next anointing
[58:59] of that spirit was in William, Mary, and
[59:02] Brham. And the next anointing of that
[59:04] spirit will not be to the gentile
[59:06] church. It will be to the Jews
[59:08] exclusively.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And it will be that Elijah spirit. And
[59:14] uh it's an interesting discussion. I
[59:15] would open up the the channels of
[59:18] discussion if we have anyone that knows
[59:20] about this, maybe has heard things about
[59:22] it. Is it going to be the literal body
[59:25] of Elijah and Moses that will actually
[59:28] be there in the land of Egypt in in in
[59:30] Israel, pardon me, or will it be just
[59:33] the anointing that actually falls upon a
[59:35] man?
[59:37] I don't know. I think it's interesting.
[59:40] I have an opinion with it. And my
[59:42] opinion is simple that I believe it will
[59:44] be the same as it was with all these
[59:46] others. It will be the anointing upon a
[59:48] man. But I don't know.
[59:52] I guess time will tell.
[59:55] And I hope we're not here to see it.
[59:59] Now, this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:00:01] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:00:04] things. This this is really what got me
[1:00:06] going. And this is what's going to get
[1:00:08] me going here. One, according to Malachi
[1:00:10] 4, he will turn the hearts of the
[1:00:12] children to the fathers. Two, he will
[1:00:14] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:00:16] thunders in Revelation 10, which are the
[1:00:20] revelations contained in the seven
[1:00:23] seals. So, this is what he's going to
[1:00:26] do. This prophet has come. When we hear
[1:00:30] people talking about mysteries, there's
[1:00:32] a problem. There are mysteries. things
[1:00:35] are mysterious until you actually
[1:00:37] realize they're revealed. But you know
[1:00:40] what it takes to reveal those mysteries?
[1:00:43] It takes Jesus Christ himself. And I
[1:00:46] think many times it's preached that we
[1:00:48] can learn our way into this. And this is
[1:00:51] why I'm so fired up because the prophet
[1:00:54] for our day, the anointing that was upon
[1:00:56] that prophet for our day, he said this.
[1:00:59] It will be these divinely revealed,
[1:01:02] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:01:06] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:01:07] children to the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:01:09] Exactly. So, so you can see the heart of
[1:01:12] brother Barry where I'm going with this.
[1:01:13] It will be these divinely revealed. It's
[1:01:16] not preached. It's not something that
[1:01:17] brother Barry can give you. Even though
[1:01:19] it is a divine revelation when you go to
[1:01:22] pulling and a man goes to preaching, God
[1:01:25] will minister to the needs. He will
[1:01:27] unveil the mysteries,
[1:01:30] but it's divinely revealed. It's got to
[1:01:33] come from God exactly like it did for
[1:01:36] Peter when he said, "What do the people
[1:01:39] say? And who do people say that I am?"
[1:01:41] And we know they said lots of others.
[1:01:43] But he said, "Who do you say that I am?"
[1:01:45] And we know, brother Peter, he said,
[1:01:46] "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:01:48] living God." Jesus said to him, you know
[1:01:50] what, Peter? Flesh and blood has not
[1:01:52] revealed that unto you. And I can't help
[1:01:53] but think that he wasn't just saying it
[1:01:55] to Peter. He was saying it to everyone
[1:01:56] that had earshot of what was going on.
[1:01:59] My father in heaven revealed that unto
[1:02:01] you. It didn't come from flesh and
[1:02:03] blood. It didn't come from your parents.
[1:02:04] Didn't come from your teachers. It
[1:02:06] didn't come from your school. Maybe a
[1:02:09] school of theology. I know there's many
[1:02:10] people that have have gone to a
[1:02:12] theological seminary and and they've
[1:02:15] come out of that and now they've gotten
[1:02:16] into the message, but you can see
[1:02:18] behaviors of that mingling in with the
[1:02:22] message. And what's that going to do?
[1:02:25] It's going to create a hybrid being. And
[1:02:28] the problem with it is it'll be just
[1:02:30] fine for that individual and maybe a
[1:02:32] couple other individuals around them,
[1:02:34] but it will not be able to reproduce.
[1:02:37] And that's what the problem is. Brother
[1:02:39] Padam says it. If you have a mule, it
[1:02:41] cannot reproduce itself because it's
[1:02:43] hybrid. But when you've got a a fresh
[1:02:46] quarter horse, that's a different story.
[1:02:48] Or a purebred any other version, it will
[1:02:51] be able to reproduce itself. And it's
[1:02:53] the same thing in a Christian life. When
[1:02:54] you've got this message mingled with
[1:02:56] something else, what you're going to
[1:02:57] have is a dead religion.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Someone might be on fire for a little
[1:03:01] while, but before long that group's
[1:03:03] going to be listening to tapes
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; because they're not able to experience
[1:03:07] the new birth.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; That new birth only comes by the spirit
[1:03:12] of God. And what happens with that new
[1:03:14] birth is we get a divinely revealed
[1:03:16] mystery truth. Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; It will be these divinely revealed
[1:03:21] mystery truths that literally,
[1:03:24] not figuratively,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; not supposedly,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; not futuristically,
[1:03:32] but literally turn the hearts of the
[1:03:35] children to the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:03:37] Exactly. So, so you can see where I'm
[1:03:39] going with this. What is the faith of
[1:03:42] the Pentecostal fathers? I'm not going
[1:03:44] to get too far into that tonight, but
[1:03:46] down the road you can bet that I am.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And and you know, brother Bradom, when
[1:03:50] you look it up, you can look up uh
[1:03:51] Pentecostal Fathers in the message, he
[1:03:53] goes right to Acts two,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; directly to Acts two. And so that's
[1:03:58] where the inspiration will come forward.
[1:03:59] If we go to Acts two and see what is the
[1:04:01] faith of the Pentecostal fathers, they
[1:04:03] acted like drunk people. They did not
[1:04:06] act all orderly. They were not lukewarm,
[1:04:09] formal, and powerless.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had the full power, the full
[1:04:14] manifestation of the Holy Ghost. That
[1:04:16] was what they were promised and that was
[1:04:18] what they actually had.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And that's what's supposed to happen in
[1:04:23] this day, brothers and sisters.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Supposed to happen in this day.
[1:04:28] And I think, you know, it only comes one
[1:04:30] way.
[1:04:32] It only comes by a new birth. And the
[1:04:35] new birth only comes by the true death.
[1:04:39] The old man's got to die. The old man's
[1:04:41] got to die 100%. And you know what?
[1:04:43] We've got to want that more than we want
[1:04:45] anything else in this world.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; We got to want it more than our job. We
[1:04:49] got to want it more than our career,
[1:04:50] more than our image, more than anything
[1:04:53] else that we have to deal with on this
[1:04:56] earth. We have got to want that more.
[1:04:58] And until we're willing to actually get
[1:05:01] there, we're just going to continue on
[1:05:03] the way we are. You know, the definition
[1:05:06] of insanity is to continue doing what
[1:05:08] we're doing the same way. and expecting
[1:05:10] a different result. I want to encourage
[1:05:13] us to see what this means to literally
[1:05:16] have our hearts turned to the
[1:05:18] Pentecostal father's faith. I don't
[1:05:20] think it means just being able to say
[1:05:22] that God sent a prophet. I could be
[1:05:24] wrong. Maybe I am. But I think there's a
[1:05:27] whole lot more that go along with it. I
[1:05:29] I think there's a lot more that goes
[1:05:31] along with it. And and you know, I'm I'm
[1:05:34] not going to say any one thing in
[1:05:35] particular. It could be music. It could
[1:05:37] be worship. It could be preaching. It
[1:05:39] could be out evangelizing. It could be
[1:05:42] all of the above. But it's what the
[1:05:44] spirit leads us to do. And I think we
[1:05:47] have the p we heard that so good a
[1:05:49] couple Wednesdays ago, didn't we? We
[1:05:50] have the pattern.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; What are we doing with that pattern? Is
[1:05:55] that pattern now? I want to say this. Is
[1:05:57] that pattern Jesus Christ the same
[1:06:01] yesterday, today, and forever? Or is
[1:06:03] that pattern a literal action according
[1:06:07] to the way William Mryiam Brandom lived
[1:06:10] his life?
[1:06:13] I think it's a very important discussion
[1:06:16] because we can go off on a tangent and
[1:06:18] say because brother Brandham drove a
[1:06:19] Ford, I better drive a Ford,
[1:06:23] right? But he also had a Jeep. He had a
[1:06:27] few different things because he hunted.
[1:06:28] Hey, we we all better hunt. We better be
[1:06:31] hunters, right? because he fished. Why
[1:06:34] oughten we to go after the covenant
[1:06:36] fish? I'll tell you if anybody wants to,
[1:06:38] there's some really good covenant fish
[1:06:40] in this river in Calgary, the Bow River.
[1:06:42] If you like fishing, they're really,
[1:06:44] really active fish in there. And the
[1:06:46] covenant fish, you know what I'm talking
[1:06:48] about. Rainbow trout. That's what
[1:06:50] brother Brandham fished for. That's what
[1:06:51] he got the record for. But you know how
[1:06:53] easy it could be to slip down that that
[1:06:56] pathway and try and do everything
[1:06:57] exactly the way Brother Brandham did it?
[1:06:59] eat the food that he ate, live where he
[1:07:01] lived. What did he say about that? He
[1:07:03] said, "Come to Tucson if you want to,
[1:07:06] but you don't have to because the
[1:07:08] rapture is going to happen universally."
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm going to get into it a
[1:07:15] little bit later, but it can become a
[1:07:16] very, very dangerous thing to pattern
[1:07:19] ourselves after a human. We don't want
[1:07:21] to do that.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; The devil wants us to. The devil wants
[1:07:28] us to. But you know what? We all are
[1:07:31] attributes of God's own nature. And we
[1:07:35] need to allow him to manifest in our
[1:07:37] lives so he can purge that nature out of
[1:07:39] us the way that he's created it in us.
[1:07:43] But these mystery truths that literally
[1:07:46] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:07:47] Pentecostal fathers, they're divinely
[1:07:50] revealed. That's the only way it's going
[1:07:52] to happen. It has got to be a pure
[1:07:55] genuine revelation from God to the
[1:07:58] individual. And you know what that is,
[1:08:00] brothers and sisters? I believe it
[1:08:01] starts with the new birth
[1:08:05] that God is my savior. That I I
[1:08:07] recognize that I'm a sinner. I recognize
[1:08:10] that I need to die out to myself so that
[1:08:13] he can live inside of me. Excuse me.
[1:08:17] Carrying on, you know, mysteries are an
[1:08:21] interesting discussion in the message.
[1:08:23] There's a a lot of discussion around the
[1:08:25] mysteries. There's mystery expos and and
[1:08:28] they're very good things. They're very
[1:08:30] instructional. But sometimes I believe
[1:08:32] people can talk in such a way that they
[1:08:35] have an edge on the mysteries. They have
[1:08:37] a full complete understanding. And a
[1:08:39] great example of that is Godhead. The
[1:08:42] Godhead doctrine. when you have someone
[1:08:44] that will be able to just absolutely lay
[1:08:47] it out and pinpoint every single aspect
[1:08:49] of the Godhead. I don't know, man. I I
[1:08:52] think it gets a little bit mysterious.
[1:08:55] We can actually try and explain things
[1:08:58] that aren't designed to be explained.
[1:09:00] Brother Bradom said it very clearly that
[1:09:02] that God is one spirit in three
[1:09:07] different offices. And I personally
[1:09:10] believe it really is that simple. Now
[1:09:13] I'm not trying to simplify God, but what
[1:09:16] I am saying is that God hides himself in
[1:09:19] simplicity and reveals himself in the
[1:09:22] same. Brother Brandham takes it from the
[1:09:24] the type who could actually look at a
[1:09:26] blade of grass and explain how that
[1:09:29] happens. Every single year it just
[1:09:32] happens. How can that be?
[1:09:35] But God hides himself in it.
[1:09:38] But you know in sir
[1:09:41] or or is this the sign of the end sir?
[1:09:43] Brother Bannon refers to this message
[1:09:44] sir is this the time of the end and it's
[1:09:46] actually titled is this the sign of the
[1:09:48] end sir in 1962 and and it's just before
[1:09:52] the seals were open and and it's right
[1:09:54] around the time where there was this
[1:09:56] spirit floating around the deity spirit
[1:09:58] and and we're going to read a little bit
[1:10:00] about that but you know in 1962 in this
[1:10:03] message in particular it's right at the
[1:10:05] end of all of 1962 on the table if
[1:10:08] you're interested brother Brandham talks
[1:10:10] about a lot of the mysteries that
[1:10:12] Brother Mvin hit on on Sunday. And it's
[1:10:16] so important to recognize that he came
[1:10:18] and he actually tied up the loose ends
[1:10:19] is what he says in that message. He tied
[1:10:22] up those mystery loose ends in the Bible
[1:10:24] that that theologians have been poking
[1:10:27] at and proddding at throughout the ages.
[1:10:29] He he just came and and tied them up.
[1:10:31] And you know, he didn't do it himself.
[1:10:34] It was that spirit of Christ that came
[1:10:36] and did it through him. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; But carrying on in our our discussion
[1:10:41] out of the the Leodysian church age in
[1:10:45] the church age book, brother Bradom, he
[1:10:46] says, "In order to further clarify our
[1:10:49] presentation of this last day prophet,
[1:10:53] let us particularly note that the
[1:10:55] prophet of Matthew
[1:10:58] 11:12
[1:10:59] was John the Baptist
[1:11:02] who was the one foretold in Malachi
[1:11:06] 3:1.
[1:11:08] Behold, I will send my messenger, and he
[1:11:12] shall prepare the way before me, and the
[1:11:16] Lord, whom ye whom ye seek, shall
[1:11:20] suddenly come to his temple, even the
[1:11:23] messenger of the covenant, whom ye
[1:11:26] delight in. Behold, he shall come, saith
[1:11:31] the Lord of hosts. Matthew 11:1-2.
[1:11:35] And it came to pass when Jesus had made
[1:11:38] an end of commanding his 12 disciples,
[1:11:41] he departed thence to teach and preach
[1:11:44] in their cities.
[1:11:46] Now when John had heard in the prison
[1:11:50] the works of Christ, he sent two of his
[1:11:53] disciples and said unto him, "Art thou
[1:11:55] he that should come, or do we look for
[1:11:58] another?" This is the one that was
[1:12:01] actually foretold
[1:12:03] by the prophet Isaiah. This is the one
[1:12:06] that was foretold by the prophet who was
[1:12:09] actually fulfilling the commission. He
[1:12:11] was in the third third anointing of
[1:12:14] Elijah. But you know what happened?
[1:12:16] Brother Bradam said his eagle eye got
[1:12:18] filmed over. He got thrown in prison for
[1:12:21] the preaching of the word for for doing
[1:12:24] the command of the Lord. And we know in
[1:12:26] the end for the the fornication, the
[1:12:28] adulterous behavior in the in the temple
[1:12:32] there, the king actually had him
[1:12:35] beheaded.
[1:12:36] But here he is in prison, seeing all
[1:12:39] that's taken place, going out
[1:12:41] prophesying, going out and and calling
[1:12:44] the the religious teachers of the day
[1:12:48] vipers.
[1:12:49] Ye generation of vipers, who told you to
[1:12:52] flee from the wrath that is to come? And
[1:12:56] here he finds himself in prison with his
[1:12:58] eagle eye filmed over. I think
[1:13:00] sometimes, brothers and sisters, if a
[1:13:02] prophet can experience that, we can
[1:13:05] experience that ourselves. We can find
[1:13:08] ourselves just maybe a little bit down
[1:13:10] in our spirit. And that's the time to
[1:13:12] worship. That is not the time to stay
[1:13:15] away from church. That's the time to
[1:13:16] come to song service and enter in.
[1:13:20] But he sent two of his disciples and
[1:13:21] said unto him, "Art thou he that should
[1:13:23] come, or do we look for another?" Jesus
[1:13:25] answered and said unto them, "Go show
[1:13:27] John again those things which ye do hear
[1:13:31] and see."
[1:13:33] The blind receive their sight, the lame
[1:13:35] walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the
[1:13:38] deaf hear, and the dead are raised up,
[1:13:41] and the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:13:44] them. and blessed is he whosoever shall
[1:13:49] not be offended in me."
[1:13:53] And as they departed, Jesus began to say
[1:13:56] to the multitudes concerning John,
[1:13:59] "What went ye out into the wilderness to
[1:14:02] see?" Why'd you go out there? What was
[1:14:05] it you were looking for? A reed shaken
[1:14:09] with the wind. But what went ye out for
[1:14:12] to see? A man clothed in soft raignment.
[1:14:16] Behold, they that wear soft clothing are
[1:14:18] in king's houses. But went what went ye
[1:14:23] out for to see? A prophet? Yay, I say
[1:14:28] unto you, and more than a prophet.
[1:14:32] For this is he of whom it is written,
[1:14:35] Behold, I send my messenger before thy
[1:14:40] face. So remember here he is actually
[1:14:45] bringing this out that it is written.
[1:14:48] It's not something that was actually
[1:14:50] already documented. They were scribing
[1:14:52] this now. But what they were scribing
[1:14:54] was that it was prior written by the
[1:14:57] prophet. I say unto you, and more than a
[1:15:01] prophet, for this is he of whom it is
[1:15:02] written, Behold, I send my messenger
[1:15:04] before thy face, which shall prepare thy
[1:15:09] way before thee. And I can't help but
[1:15:13] think, brothers and sisters, I'll
[1:15:14] probably say this a couple times
[1:15:15] tonight, the spirit that was on John the
[1:15:18] Baptist, which is the spirit that was on
[1:15:22] William Mary and Brandham. He was doing
[1:15:24] exactly what John was doing for a
[1:15:26] different purpose in the Ohio River at
[1:15:29] the foot of Spring Street in
[1:15:30] Jeffersonville, Indiana on the 17th
[1:15:33] person that day. What happened? There
[1:15:35] was a light that came down from heaven.
[1:15:38] It was the pillar of fire. I can't help
[1:15:40] but think. And what did he say? Out of
[1:15:43] that pillar of fire,
[1:15:45] just like John the Baptist, the one we
[1:15:47] just read, was sent to forerun the first
[1:15:51] coming of the Lord, so to your ministry
[1:15:55] will forerun the second coming of the
[1:15:59] Lord.
[1:16:03] He says, "Verily, I say unto you, among
[1:16:05] them that are born of women, there hath
[1:16:07] not risen a greater than John the
[1:16:09] Baptist.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Notwithstanding,
[1:16:12] he that is least in the kingdom of
[1:16:14] heaven is greater than he."
[1:16:17] Now, Brother Brand, I'm going on here. I
[1:16:19] I apologize for the reading. I just
[1:16:21] thought it would be really good just to
[1:16:23] say what he said. Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; This has already taken place. It's
[1:16:31] already happened. This has happened.
[1:16:33] It's over. But note now in Malachi
[1:16:38] 4:1-6.
[1:16:40] For behold, the day cometh that shall
[1:16:42] burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay,
[1:16:46] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:16:48] stubble. And the day that cometh shall
[1:16:52] burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts,
[1:16:55] that it shall leave them neither root
[1:16:57] nor branch.
[1:17:00] But unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:17:03] son of righteousness arise with healing
[1:17:06] in his wings. Isn't it beautiful to
[1:17:09] think about that scripture? But unto you
[1:17:11] that fear my name shall the son of
[1:17:13] righteousness arise. Where is he going
[1:17:15] to arise, brothers and sisters? There's
[1:17:17] not going to be some day where he's
[1:17:19] going to arise out of the grave
[1:17:21] somewhere because we're going to meet
[1:17:22] with him in the clouds, right? That's
[1:17:24] the scripture. We'll go to meet with him
[1:17:27] in the clouds. And then Revelations 19,
[1:17:29] he's going to come back riding on a
[1:17:31] horse with the sword of the word and his
[1:17:35] name written on his thigh. You know that
[1:17:36] scripture. Revelations 19, he's going to
[1:17:38] do that and we're all going to be there
[1:17:39] with him. But how is the son of
[1:17:41] righteousness going to arise? He's going
[1:17:44] to arise in the hearts of his bride in
[1:17:47] the last days. He's going to arise with
[1:17:50] righteousness in his bride body with
[1:17:53] healing in his wings. And ye shall go
[1:17:56] forth and grow up as calves of the
[1:17:58] stall. Can you imagine what it will be
[1:18:01] look like? What it will be like to look
[1:18:03] back on our lives if we have the
[1:18:05] possibility to do so. as we prayed, you
[1:18:08] know, tonight to think about the story
[1:18:10] of the prophet and the Syrians
[1:18:12] surrounding the prophet and his helper
[1:18:14] and Giza all in a flat because the
[1:18:17] Syrians are surrounding him and goes and
[1:18:20] gets the master and says, "How shall we
[1:18:21] do?" And he's like, "Man, I haven't even
[1:18:23] had a cup of coffee this morning and
[1:18:25] you're already bugging me." So, what
[1:18:27] does he do? He prays, "Lord, open that
[1:18:29] boy's eyes. Open his eyes. Let him see
[1:18:32] that there's more for us than there is
[1:18:34] for the enemy." And you know, I I just
[1:18:37] wonder if one day we're going to be able
[1:18:38] to look back in our lives and think
[1:18:40] about all the times we were fighting and
[1:18:42] struggling and toiling and lamenting.
[1:18:45] But to know if we could just know that
[1:18:47] there are so many angels around us
[1:18:50] because we fear him. Those who fear him,
[1:18:54] he will surround them. That's his word.
[1:18:56] But I just I just think it's a beautiful
[1:18:58] thing if we could just have that peace
[1:19:00] to know that he's completely got it all
[1:19:02] under control right when it seems like
[1:19:03] it's completely out of control. That's
[1:19:05] when he's in the most control, brothers
[1:19:07] and sisters. That's when we're going to
[1:19:08] see the greatest manifestation of the
[1:19:10] Lord in our lives when it's completely
[1:19:12] out of control. But unto you that fear
[1:19:15] my name shall the son of righteousness
[1:19:17] arise with healing in his wings. And ye
[1:19:20] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[1:19:23] the stall. You won't have wolves nipping
[1:19:26] at your heels. You'll be just like a cal
[1:19:28] in a stall, completely protected. You'll
[1:19:31] have all the temperature controlled.
[1:19:33] You'll have all the food that you need.
[1:19:35] Everything will be just completely
[1:19:37] looked after as a calf of the stall. And
[1:19:40] ye shall tread down the wicked. You ever
[1:19:43] see the way a cow is in a stall? Anybody
[1:19:45] ever seen that before? They just they
[1:19:48] just step and it doesn't matter what's
[1:19:50] under them. It just gets stomped. It
[1:19:52] just gets crushed. It just gets sheared.
[1:19:54] It gets broken. It's just what happens.
[1:19:57] But I just think it's an interesting
[1:19:59] comparison that you would grow up as a
[1:20:00] calf of the stall and tread down the
[1:20:03] wicked, for they shall be ashes under
[1:20:07] the soles of your feet in the day that I
[1:20:08] shall do this, sayaeth the Lord of
[1:20:10] Hosts. Remember ye the law of Moses, my
[1:20:13] servant, which I commanded unto him in
[1:20:15] Horeb for all Israel, with statutes and
[1:20:18] judgments. Behold, I will send you
[1:20:22] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:20:24] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:20:28] And he shall turn the heart of the
[1:20:29] fathers to the children. And we know the
[1:20:33] heart of the fathers has already been
[1:20:36] turned to the children.
[1:20:39] That's already taken place. It's the
[1:20:41] heart of the children to their fathers.
[1:20:45] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:20:48] curse. Brother Brandham says, see
[1:20:50] immediately after the coming of this
[1:20:54] Elijah, the earth will be cleansed by
[1:20:57] fire and the wicked burned to ashes. Now
[1:21:02] I can see this one paragraph being taken
[1:21:05] and and played upon because immediately
[1:21:08] I have a question because it says see
[1:21:11] immediately after the coming of this
[1:21:14] Elijah
[1:21:16] this Elijah has already come hasn't he?
[1:21:22] I I think he's already come. But what is
[1:21:25] a space of time in God's economy?
[1:21:29] One day is as a thousand years, right?
[1:21:33] And a thousand years is is as a day. And
[1:21:36] I know somebody worked out the math on
[1:21:38] that when you get into minutes. Um I'm
[1:21:40] not going to go there. I'm not even
[1:21:41] going to try, but a mathematician did it
[1:21:44] once. And it's kind of an interesting
[1:21:46] discussion. But how how long is that
[1:21:48] immediately going to be? We don't know.
[1:21:51] But we know that that's coming. We know
[1:21:52] that the Lord will never flood the earth
[1:21:54] again with water. That's already taken
[1:21:56] place. And he set his bow in the cloud.
[1:21:58] And uh we know that the age is trying to
[1:22:00] pervert that with all they can. But it
[1:22:03] doesn't change it for the true believer
[1:22:04] because we know every time we see that
[1:22:07] bow in the cloud. We know that was
[1:22:09] actually a covenant that God has given
[1:22:11] to man that he will never ever destroy
[1:22:14] the earth by water. But there is a
[1:22:17] promise and that is to destroy the earth
[1:22:20] by fire. And we know thankfully through
[1:22:24] the vindicated prophet in the day in
[1:22:26] which we live. I I'm going to go back
[1:22:27] and correct myself. It's not to destroy
[1:22:29] the earth because the earth isn't going
[1:22:31] to be destroyed. The wicked are going to
[1:22:33] be destroyed. What's going to happen is
[1:22:35] the earth is going to be renovated.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I believe brother Brandham does say it
[1:22:39] in the message somewhere that the actual
[1:22:42] earth is going to flip over.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to be completely renovated.
[1:22:46] So, if you could imagine what it will be
[1:22:48] like for all of the magma and everything
[1:22:50] to happen, have you ever seen a flow
[1:22:52] from a volcano? it it flows out and it's
[1:22:55] black and it's really sharp and it looks
[1:22:58] like there's no life, but you know, if
[1:23:00] you give it a few years, you'll see
[1:23:01] little tiny green plants coming out of
[1:23:03] it, just growing all over it. I just
[1:23:06] can't help but think it will be just
[1:23:08] like that one day on this earth. And you
[1:23:10] know, there'll be a thousand years for
[1:23:12] it to actually replenish.
[1:23:15] It's amazing to think about.
[1:23:18] But brother Bradom, he says that uh
[1:23:20] immediately after the coming of this
[1:23:22] Elijah, the earth will be cleansed by
[1:23:24] fire and the wicked burn to ashes. And
[1:23:26] you know, we're looking at that right
[1:23:28] now. This this world is not our home.
[1:23:30] Brothers and sisters, don't get comfy
[1:23:32] here. It is any moment going to rain
[1:23:35] fire. And I'm not trying to scare us,
[1:23:37] but that's the promise for the day in
[1:23:39] which we live. But you know, that's the
[1:23:41] promise for the wicked. The promise for
[1:23:43] us is to actually go and meet our
[1:23:45] heavenly father in the air. And and I
[1:23:48] think it's amazing to have the
[1:23:49] discussion just to even have the
[1:23:51] discussion to think about you know the
[1:23:53] space of about 40 days I think brother
[1:23:55] Brandham says something very similar to
[1:23:56] that about 40 days there will
[1:23:59] potentially be people that we know that
[1:24:01] have gone on before us to actually
[1:24:04] manifest and say to us take courage
[1:24:07] don't be afraid because all that you
[1:24:09] believed is taking place right now. All
[1:24:12] that you lived is actually happening
[1:24:14] right before your eyes. Can you imagine
[1:24:17] what it will be like to actually see
[1:24:19] that, to perceive that
[1:24:22] immediately after the coming of this
[1:24:23] Elijah, the earth will be cleansed by
[1:24:25] fire and the wicked burn to ashes. He
[1:24:28] says, of course, this did not happen at
[1:24:30] the time of John, the Elijah for his
[1:24:34] day, the spirit of God that prophesied
[1:24:36] the coming of the messenger in Malachi
[1:24:39] 3:1. John was but reiterating his
[1:24:44] previous prophetic statement of Isaiah
[1:24:47] 40:3
[1:24:49] made at least three centuries
[1:24:52] previously. The voice of him that crith
[1:24:54] in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[1:24:56] the Lord, make straight in the desert a
[1:24:59] highway for our God. Now John by the
[1:25:02] Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and
[1:25:05] Malachi in Matthew 3:3. What a beautiful
[1:25:10] summary. For this is he that was spoken
[1:25:12] of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "The
[1:25:15] voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[1:25:17] prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
[1:25:21] paths straight."
[1:25:25] I love how brother Brandham just just
[1:25:27] brings this all together. He brings it
[1:25:28] out so clearly.
[1:25:31] This prophet is going to have the same
[1:25:34] nature as the other prophets. Brother
[1:25:36] Brandham says that in here. He goes on
[1:25:38] to say, "But consider this also. This
[1:25:40] prophet messenger will be in his nature
[1:25:43] and manners as were Elijah and John."
[1:25:48] So with a few minutes here, I just
[1:25:50] wanted to take a minute and just look at
[1:25:53] Elijah and John.
[1:25:56] Elijah,
[1:25:58] first Kings 21. First Kings 21, if you
[1:26:01] don't mind.
[1:26:03] Maybe a little bit of a Bible study
[1:26:05] tonight.
[1:26:07] just to uh
[1:26:10] amplify what the prophet's saying here.
[1:26:13] First Kings
[1:26:15] 21.
[1:26:18] I uh
[1:26:23] yeah, first Kings 21.
[1:26:30] And it's it's
[1:26:32] for the sake of time, I would uh I would
[1:26:36] say just go and read it if you want to
[1:26:38] get the backstory, but it's you know the
[1:26:40] story about Neabboth and how God finally
[1:26:43] had enough and he sent his prophet by.
[1:26:46] But verse 23 out of first kings 21, this
[1:26:50] this is the nature of this prophet. He
[1:26:52] has no compunction going and saying what
[1:26:55] the Lord put in his mouth. Verse 23
[1:26:58] says, "And Jezebel also spake the Lord."
[1:27:02] This is the Lord speaking through his
[1:27:04] prophet, "Say, the dogs shall eat
[1:27:06] Jezebel by the wall of Jezrael.
[1:27:11] Him that dieth of Ahab in the city of
[1:27:14] dogs shall eat, and him that dieth in
[1:27:18] the field, the fowls of the air eat."
[1:27:24] This prophet had no problem saying what
[1:27:27] the Lord put on his heart.
[1:27:30] Matthew chapter 3, just a couple pages
[1:27:33] over from where we were in Malachi.
[1:27:37] Matthew chapter 3.
[1:27:42] I think it's just really neat to see it
[1:27:44] in in the word what the prophet is
[1:27:47] speaking about.
[1:27:49] In Matthew chapter 3 verse 1 it says in
[1:27:52] those days came John the Baptist
[1:27:55] preaching in the wilderness of Judea
[1:27:58] and saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[1:28:01] heaven is at hand
[1:28:04] for this is he that was spoken of by the
[1:28:07] prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one
[1:28:09] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[1:28:11] way of the Lord make his paths straight.
[1:28:15] Can you imagine that this guy would have
[1:28:18] just been rattling all of the scholars,
[1:28:22] all of the theologians, all of the
[1:28:25] seminaries,
[1:28:26] all of the Sadducees and the Pharisees
[1:28:29] would be so upset because this would be
[1:28:32] so out of order for what they actually
[1:28:35] believed in their day. And it's
[1:28:37] absolutely amazing when when you just
[1:28:40] stop and ponder this thought. This is
[1:28:42] exactly what happened in our day with
[1:28:45] William Mariam Brham because he's a
[1:28:48] backwoods
[1:28:49] Kentucky hillbilly as he's referred to
[1:28:52] many times. Someone without an education
[1:28:55] was able to come and confound the
[1:28:57] scholars. But what he did was he
[1:29:00] identified himself in the scripture. And
[1:29:02] as soon as he did that, that's where
[1:29:03] they say, "Oh, no. Now you go and you
[1:29:05] make yourself something." No, no, no.
[1:29:07] All he did was identify his position in
[1:29:09] the word. And here we have John doing
[1:29:12] the exact same thing. This is he that
[1:29:14] was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,
[1:29:16] saying, "The voice of one crying in the
[1:29:19] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[1:29:20] Lord, make his path straight." And the
[1:29:23] same John had his raignment of
[1:29:26] camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair and a leather and
[1:29:28] girdle about his loins. And his meat,
[1:29:33] excuse me,
[1:29:35] his meat was locust and wild honey.
[1:29:40] I can't imagine eating locust and wild
[1:29:42] honey. Can imagine the honey, but
[1:29:46] then went out to him
[1:29:50] Jerusalem and all Judea and all the
[1:29:53] region round about Jordan and were
[1:29:56] baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
[1:29:59] their sins. People had a genuine desire.
[1:30:03] There was an anointing for that day.
[1:30:06] Things were very, very anointed. There
[1:30:08] was a very strong pull. Everybody knew
[1:30:12] something was taking place. And I just
[1:30:14] can't help but think, you know, brothers
[1:30:15] and sisters, before the coming of the
[1:30:18] Messiah there, everybody had there was a
[1:30:21] buzz in the land. There was something
[1:30:23] taking place that everybody was aware
[1:30:26] something was different. And I just
[1:30:28] think it's exactly like today, isn't it?
[1:30:30] Everyone's aware this world, something
[1:30:33] is different in this world now.
[1:30:35] Something is taking place. And we know
[1:30:37] what it is. He's the same yesterday,
[1:30:40] today, and forever. Verse seven here.
[1:30:42] This is the nature of this guy, the
[1:30:44] nature of this prophet. But when he saw
[1:30:47] many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come
[1:30:50] to his baptism, he said unto them, "Oh
[1:30:53] generation of vipers, who hath warned
[1:30:56] you to flee from the wrath to come?
[1:30:59] Bring forth therefore fruits, meat for
[1:31:03] repentance."
[1:31:05] Talk is cheap. Bring some repentance
[1:31:08] forward. Show a life that's worthy of
[1:31:12] this gospel.
[1:31:14] Verse nine. And think not to say within
[1:31:17] yourselves, we have brother Brandham our
[1:31:20] father.
[1:31:23] Think not to say in yourselves that we
[1:31:26] have Abraham our father. For I say unto
[1:31:30] you that God is able these stones to
[1:31:33] raise up children unto Abraham.
[1:31:36] This is where I wanted to get into
[1:31:38] tonight, brothers and sisters. It can be
[1:31:40] very easy for us to have someone whom we
[1:31:43] might consider to be our father in the
[1:31:45] faith. We only need to have one, and
[1:31:48] that is Jesus Christ. The prophet in our
[1:31:52] day came to put us on to Jesus Christ to
[1:31:55] do the introduction. And he would not
[1:31:58] have been taken off the scene had that
[1:32:00] introduction not been made.
[1:32:03] But it's so beautiful because we still
[1:32:05] live in the days of that voice. And
[1:32:09] we're going to be living in that space
[1:32:10] of time, the days of the voice, right up
[1:32:13] until the rapture takes place. That's
[1:32:16] how far it's going to go. But I think
[1:32:18] it's amazing when we look at this
[1:32:19] because, you know, there's a compound
[1:32:21] meaning and revelation for every single
[1:32:22] scripture. And I know some people might
[1:32:24] not like me throwing in Brother
[1:32:26] Brandham's name here, but I want to
[1:32:27] shake us up like we heard a couple
[1:32:29] Wednesdays ago. Let's not think that we
[1:32:32] just have a perfect pattern and
[1:32:33] everything is fine. Let's check
[1:32:34] ourselves. Let's make sure that our
[1:32:37] pattern is his pattern, that we're
[1:32:39] fitting into his mold. We're not saying
[1:32:41] that I have Abraham to my father, so I
[1:32:44] I'm I'm all good. What are you going to
[1:32:46] tell me about? It's got to be the Holy
[1:32:48] Spirit. These are divinely revealed
[1:32:50] mystery truths,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; not scholarly revealed mystery truths.
[1:32:57] He goes on to say, "And now also the axe
[1:33:01] is laid unto the root of the trees.
[1:33:04] Therefore, every tree which bringeth not
[1:33:07] forth good fruit is heened down and cast
[1:33:10] into the fire." And you know that's
[1:33:13] what's exactly what's going to take
[1:33:15] place here. That axe, this axe that
[1:33:18] we're talking about is the axe of the
[1:33:20] word. What's going to do the separating
[1:33:22] when the reapers come?
[1:33:24] It's not going to be angels flying and
[1:33:28] grabbing and picking up and flying away
[1:33:32] and bringing and setting down. What's
[1:33:34] going to happen? That might happen. That
[1:33:37] might happen. But the first thing that's
[1:33:38] going to happen is the preaching of this
[1:33:40] word is going to go forwards. The
[1:33:43] preaching of the word through the
[1:33:44] vindicated angels in every single age is
[1:33:48] going to do the separating. That's
[1:33:50] what's going to do the separating of of
[1:33:52] the wheat and the chaff. It's not going
[1:33:54] to be a a literal angelic separation.
[1:33:58] It's the preaching of the word for your
[1:34:00] day is what does it. And and some people
[1:34:03] say like we say all the time, you hear
[1:34:05] it. Some people said, "He called me a
[1:34:06] crow. All service long alls he did was
[1:34:08] was harp on me and the other people will
[1:34:10] say you know what I just soared like an
[1:34:12] eagle because I know that he was
[1:34:14] speaking to me. It was my theophony that
[1:34:16] was pulling on that word.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is. We can't
[1:34:20] change that. The only thing we can do is
[1:34:22] say amen to the word. The more we say
[1:34:23] amen to the word, the more the word
[1:34:25] comes. Verse 11 says, I indeed baptize
[1:34:28] you with water unto repentance. It was a
[1:34:31] form. And now we actually get baptized
[1:34:34] as an inward outward work, outward
[1:34:37] expression of the inward work that's
[1:34:39] taken place from this repentance. He
[1:34:41] says, I indeed baptize you with water
[1:34:44] unto repentance. But he that cometh
[1:34:47] after me is mightier than I whose shoes
[1:34:50] I'm not worthy to bear. He shall baptize
[1:34:54] you with what? With the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:57] with fire.
[1:34:59] That's what he's going to do. It's not
[1:35:02] about actually just joining church and
[1:35:05] being a part of something. It's actually
[1:35:08] being baptized by the Holy Ghost. That
[1:35:11] is our commission
[1:35:15] for the day in which we live. Brothers
[1:35:17] and sisters,
[1:35:19] only believe. If we believe, we'll
[1:35:21] follow the instruction.
[1:35:24] The people of this prophet messenger's
[1:35:26] day will be as they were in Ahab's day
[1:35:31] and in John's. And since it is only the
[1:35:35] children whose hearts will be turned,
[1:35:38] it's only the children who will listen.
[1:35:42] In the days of Ahab, only 7,000 true
[1:35:45] seed Israelites were found. In the days
[1:35:47] of John, there were also very few.
[1:35:52] The masses in both ages were in the
[1:35:55] fornication of idolatry.
[1:35:59] And that right there I believe could be
[1:36:01] a sermon and a series. The fornication
[1:36:04] of idolatry. In in a nutshell, anything
[1:36:08] that we put ahead of this word in our
[1:36:10] lives is adultery. It's the fornication
[1:36:14] of idultery. What we do is we become
[1:36:18] adulterinist because we're trying to
[1:36:20] hang on to the old selves and hang on to
[1:36:24] a new husband. And brother Bradam in the
[1:36:26] invisible union, he says, "You can't do
[1:36:27] it. It's impossible to do it." He talks
[1:36:30] about it in marriage and divorce. It's
[1:36:31] impossible to do it. If we try and do
[1:36:33] that, if we try and hold on to the old
[1:36:35] man and then be spiritual, be a
[1:36:38] Christian and whatever, then we're
[1:36:39] adulterers. We're an adulteress. And
[1:36:41] brother Brandham says, "Nobody," we know
[1:36:43] the word says it too. Nobody will
[1:36:45] inherit the kingdom of heaven as an
[1:36:46] adulterer, as a fornicator. If we're
[1:36:49] going to go and mess around with all the
[1:36:50] things of the world and still come to
[1:36:52] church and act like everything is all
[1:36:54] right, there's something severely wrong.
[1:36:58] It's the fornication of idolatry. He
[1:37:00] says it just like in all the other ages,
[1:37:01] that's the way it'll be. Brandon goes on
[1:37:04] to talk. He says in the last few minutes
[1:37:05] here I want to make one more comparison
[1:37:08] between the Leodysian prophet messenger
[1:37:10] and John the prophet messenger who
[1:37:13] preceded Jesus' first coming. The people
[1:37:16] in John's day mistook him for the
[1:37:19] Messiah.
[1:37:20] Now these are the believers. These
[1:37:22] aren't the actual unbelievers. These
[1:37:24] aren't the religious zealots. The ones
[1:37:27] who are the theologians that just
[1:37:29] scoffed and said whatever. Not the
[1:37:31] unbelievers. These are the believers.
[1:37:33] The people mistook him for the Messiah.
[1:37:35] Messiah. John 1:19 to20. And this is the
[1:37:38] record of John when the Jews sent
[1:37:40] priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
[1:37:42] ask, "Who art thou?" And he confessed
[1:37:45] and denied not, but confessed, "I am not
[1:37:47] the Christ." Now this last day prophet
[1:37:51] messenger will have such power before
[1:37:54] the Lord that there will be those who
[1:37:57] mistake him for the Lord Jesus. And and
[1:38:00] I'm I'm I'm this year I was able to go
[1:38:05] and see where some of this actually took
[1:38:08] place from the ministry of William
[1:38:11] Marryiam Brham in uh the Battlefords.
[1:38:14] There was a deity spirit that came out
[1:38:17] and it's interesting because it
[1:38:18] manifested in the 60 6162
[1:38:22] region in that area. But he said,
[1:38:25] "Listen, if you do that with me and my
[1:38:28] ministry, then you make me antichrist
[1:38:30] because I am not him. I am only
[1:38:33] preparing the way for him. I was only
[1:38:36] standing there when he came." But the
[1:38:39] thing of it is, if you do that with me,
[1:38:41] you make me an antichrist. And and
[1:38:43] because of that, I take myself off the
[1:38:44] field until you guys straighten it out.
[1:38:46] And he did for a short while. Took
[1:38:48] himself off the field. And they did
[1:38:50] correct it. They did try to anyways. But
[1:38:53] sometimes you start these things and
[1:38:54] they just can't be stopped. A and
[1:38:56] nothing you can really do about it after
[1:38:58] that. It's too late. They're spirits,
[1:39:00] but they're anointed spirits. And if a
[1:39:02] spirit like that gets on a person, it's
[1:39:05] terrible. And we know that spirit's
[1:39:06] still alive. We know the spirit of John
[1:39:08] the Baptist is still alive. There's
[1:39:09] people that still follow the teachings
[1:39:11] of John the Baptist. They have not
[1:39:13] decided to actually let go of that and
[1:39:15] go on. They say it's a safe spot to be.
[1:39:18] And and maybe it is. Maybe there's some
[1:39:20] people that want to actually just get
[1:39:22] involved with the deity spirit and
[1:39:24] believe that William Brham was a version
[1:39:26] of Christ and to some extent he was. But
[1:39:29] like he said very well he wasn't the
[1:39:32] fullness. He talked about it in this way
[1:39:36] that you could take a spoonful of water
[1:39:38] out of the ocean and you'll have all of
[1:39:40] the elements of that ocean in a
[1:39:42] spoonful.
[1:39:44] And that was what brother Brham had. He
[1:39:46] had a spoonful of the ministry of Jesus
[1:39:49] Christ in his life. He was only here to
[1:39:52] introduce Jesus Christ. He was only here
[1:39:55] to fulfill scripture. And we're only
[1:39:57] here to actually love Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] We're only here to be his bride. We're
[1:40:02] only here to fulfill that portion of
[1:40:03] scripture for us, too. We're all here
[1:40:06] because of Jesus Christ. But he says
[1:40:08] there will be a spirit in the world at
[1:40:11] the end time that will seduce some and
[1:40:13] make them believe this. Matthew
[1:40:15] 24:24-26,
[1:40:17] for there shall arise false Christs and
[1:40:19] false prophets and show great signs and
[1:40:21] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:40:22] possible, they shall deceive the very
[1:40:24] elect. But we know that it's not
[1:40:25] possible because the very elect can't be
[1:40:27] deceived. Why not? Because she has the
[1:40:29] spirit of Christ. She has the Holy
[1:40:31] Ghost. And you will not deceive the Holy
[1:40:34] Ghost. It's just not possible.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Because she has said, "Hey, the word of
[1:40:40] God says, let this mind be in you that
[1:40:42] was also in Christ Jesus. Be it unto me
[1:40:45] according to thy word.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful when we when we
[1:40:51] look at this this there will arise false
[1:40:53] Christ. There's going to be people,
[1:40:55] brother Bradom says it in many places in
[1:40:56] the message of the hour that stand
[1:40:58] before Jesus and say, "Lord, Lord,
[1:41:01] didn't we cast out devils in your name?
[1:41:03] Didn't we have mighty wonderful services
[1:41:05] and talk about all kinds of mysteries
[1:41:08] and have people healed and see all kinds
[1:41:10] of signs and wonders? didn't didn't we
[1:41:13] do that in your name? And he's going to
[1:41:16] say, I never even knew you. Now,
[1:41:19] remember the word new? No. In the Bible,
[1:41:22] it talks about something in a different
[1:41:24] way than maybe what we're seeing when we
[1:41:27] hear that word as as North Americans.
[1:41:30] It's actually an intimate relationship.
[1:41:33] I never knew you. And without that
[1:41:35] intimate relationship, brothers and
[1:41:37] sisters, we're going to miss it. But he
[1:41:39] says it, "Behold, I told you before.
[1:41:42] Wherefore, if they shall say unto you,
[1:41:44] Behold, he's in the desert, go not
[1:41:45] forth. Behold, he's in the secret
[1:41:47] chambers, believe it not." But don't you
[1:41:50] believe it. He is not Jesus Christ. He
[1:41:53] is not the son of God. He He's saying it
[1:41:57] here. He is one of the brethren, a
[1:42:00] prophet, messenger, a servant of God.
[1:42:04] He needs no greater honor bestowed upon
[1:42:07] him than that which John received when
[1:42:10] he was the voice that cried, "I am not
[1:42:12] he, but he is coming after me.
[1:42:18] I'll call the musicians."
[1:42:21] So I think it's important, brothers and
[1:42:23] sisters, he needs, he says this, his
[1:42:26] words here, and I believe this is why
[1:42:27] some people discount the church age book
[1:42:30] because it enables them to actually
[1:42:32] uplift whatever wacky thing they're
[1:42:34] promoting. He needs no greater honor
[1:42:38] bestowed upon him than that which John
[1:42:40] received when he was the voice that
[1:42:43] cried, "I am not he, but he is coming
[1:42:46] after me."
[1:42:49] Even though this book was grammarized by
[1:42:52] a theologian, this book was written by
[1:42:55] William Brham.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And I I can't prove that to you. I I can
[1:43:01] only say I just believe. Amen.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's all I can say.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to stake my life on this
[1:43:07] book. This book is such a tremendous
[1:43:10] help for the message of the hour.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I'm I'm I'm going to get
[1:43:16] into this for sure in the future
[1:43:19] for sure. These divinely revealed
[1:43:22] mystery truths that will literally turn
[1:43:25] the hearts of the children to the
[1:43:26] Pentecostal fathers without a doubt.
[1:43:34] Yes, I uh I just got excited when I got
[1:43:38] up here and I forgot to mention that we
[1:43:40] do have meetings this weekend. There's a
[1:43:43] meeting Saturday night at 6:00. We're
[1:43:45] going to have brother Danny Delmundo and
[1:43:47] then a regular service Sunday morning.
[1:43:50] And uh we've got a picnic on Sunday
[1:43:52] afternoon as well. And uh one more thing
[1:43:55] is uh I believe Sunday will likely be
[1:43:58] the last service that the Elagis will
[1:44:01] have with us here before they move to uh
[1:44:04] Nigeria. So if you get the opportunity
[1:44:07] to see them, by all means greet them and
[1:44:10] uh let them know that you love them and
[1:44:13] we'll miss them.
[1:44:15] Maybe stand with me as we close tonight.
[1:44:19] I'd also just like to thank sister Epha
[1:44:21] and brother Toby for that special. It
[1:44:23] was tremendous.
[1:44:25] Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:44:28] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we love
[1:44:30] you tonight and we thank you for your
[1:44:32] word. We thank you Lord Jesus that you
[1:44:36] have divinely revealed mystery truths.
[1:44:41] And Lord Jesus, if we are able to
[1:44:43] understand them, it's only because you
[1:44:45] have chosen us in you to be able to
[1:44:48] understand them. If we can see them,
[1:44:50] it's because you've enabled us to see
[1:44:51] them. And Father, we don't puff
[1:44:54] ourselves up, Lord. We truly acknowledge
[1:44:56] the grace that you have given us, Lord,
[1:44:58] to be able to recognize this. Oh Lord
[1:45:01] Jesus, to be able to be a message
[1:45:03] believer is only because you called us
[1:45:05] in you before the foundation of the
[1:45:07] world, Lord. Not because somebody gave
[1:45:10] us a tradition or or a teaching, but
[1:45:13] because you chose us, Father. And we
[1:45:15] thank you for the choosing that you have
[1:45:17] done. Lord, help us to live a life
[1:45:21] that's worthy of this choosing. Help us
[1:45:23] to live a life that's worthy of this
[1:45:25] gospel, Lord Jesus, before the people in
[1:45:28] this world. We know that we are written
[1:45:30] epistles that are read of all men. It
[1:45:33] doesn't matter what we say. It really
[1:45:35] matters what we do. How we live our
[1:45:38] lives shows whose life is inside of us.
[1:45:41] Help us, Lord Jesus, to show this world
[1:45:44] that your life is inside of us. Father,
[1:45:47] tonight I just want to pray that if
[1:45:48] anybody has a need, Father, that maybe
[1:45:51] they just desire more of you or just
[1:45:54] have a question in their heart, Lord,
[1:45:56] sovereignly tonight, I pray that you
[1:45:58] would answer that need, that you would
[1:45:59] answer that question, Lord Jesus. If
[1:46:02] somebody longs for more of you, then
[1:46:04] Father, pour yourself out tonight, Lord.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Father, how we love you and we thank you
[1:46:09] for your goodness. Lord, we pray for
[1:46:12] those who couldn't be here tonight,
[1:46:13] wherever they are, whatever they're
[1:46:15] doing, Lord Jesus. We pray that you
[1:46:17] would just minister your grace unto
[1:46:20] them.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, we just ask that you would
[1:46:23] keep your hand upon us, Lord, as we go
[1:46:25] our separate ways. that
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; if it's your will for us to gather again
[1:46:29] on Saturday, Lord, that you would just,
[1:46:32] Father, anoint us, Lord Jesus, with ears
[1:46:34] to hear what your spirit has to say to
[1:46:36] us through our brother. And Father, we
[1:46:39] just ask also that you would make his
[1:46:41] path straight, Lord. That you would give
[1:46:43] him traveling mercies. Be with our
[1:46:44] brother Danny, Father, and bring him
[1:46:47] here safely, Lord, with a fresh coal off
[1:46:49] the altar, Lord. And we'll be careful to
[1:46:52] give you the praise. Lord, we love you
[1:46:54] and we thank you. We just ask all these
[1:46:56] things now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:46:59] pray.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And nothing I desire compares to you,
[1:47:07] Lord. You are, oh Lord,
[1:47:12] you are
[1:47:15] you're more precious
[1:47:19] than silver.
[1:47:23] And Lord,
[1:47:26] you
[1:47:28] are
[1:47:31] cross
[1:47:34] and go
[1:47:38] and Lord
[1:47:41] you are
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:45] more beautiful
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:48] than God.
[1:47:53] and nothing that I
[1:47:56] desire
[1:47:58] compared
[1:48:00] with you. Lord, you are
[1:48:03] making your confession tonight.
[1:48:06] Oh Lord,
[1:48:10] you are
[1:48:14] more precious
[1:48:17] than sin.
[1:48:22] And Lord,
[1:48:25] you are
[1:48:32] that
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:39] beautiful.
[1:48:43] more beautiful
[1:48:47] than God
[1:48:51] and nothing that I
[1:48:54] desire
[1:48:56] compares
[1:48:58] with you.
[1:49:02] Can we sing? I lift your name.
[1:49:06] I lift your name. Your holy name.

[1:50:04] so far away and cold.

[1:50:14] same.
