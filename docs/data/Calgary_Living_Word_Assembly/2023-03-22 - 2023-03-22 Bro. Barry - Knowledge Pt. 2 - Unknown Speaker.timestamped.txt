[10:58] may you fill us Heavenly Father
[11:02] may you help us father just to surrender

[11:15] considering that the times and the
[11:18] seasons that we are living in Lord even

[11:24] if we say it more than 60 years ago what
[11:27] about today
[11:28] how much closer we are Lord Jesus

[11:58] that second for the purpose that you had
[12:00] before the foundation of the world may
[12:03] you help us this evening
[12:04] Lord Jesus may you just draw us more
[12:07] closer to you Lord

[35:58] giving honor unto the wife
[36:00] as unto the weaker vessel
[36:03] and as being heirs together of the grace
[36:06] of life
[36:07] that your prayers be not hindered let's
[36:09] just bow one more time
[36:11] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[36:13] word thank you for the Revelation that
[36:15] you've given us
[36:16] of your word Lord we pray that you would
[36:19] just
[36:19] break the bread of life to us fresh once
[36:22] again Lord that tonight when we leave
[36:24] this building we would say that Lord
[36:26] we're not the same people that we were
[36:28] when we came in that you just took us by
[36:30] the hand father and you spoke to us that
[36:33] you taught taught us tonight father
[36:35] we just ask that we could sit at your
[36:37] feet tonight as our master and that you
[36:39] would just minister to us Lord
[36:41] we ask all these things now in Jesus
[36:43] Christ's name we pray amen
[36:45] I bless you tonight you may be seated
[36:53] certainly thankful to see you sister
[36:55] Faye
[36:57] my goodness certainly thankful for the
[36:59] good news about Baby John
[37:01] baby Jeremy John or jera Bessa
[37:06] something that we can never take lightly
[37:07] when you
[37:09] see Life come into the world you know
[37:11] brother Branham talks about that how
[37:12] that baby is ordained from God that's a
[37:15] little piece of God that actually is
[37:18] ordained to be put into a body bypassing
[37:22] its theophany and it's that light and
[37:25] and that life that comes into that body
[37:28] where the random talks about the the
[37:30] Angels standing by standing guard for
[37:33] that life to actually pass from the
[37:35] throne into that baby into that flesh
[37:38] it's never ever something that we take
[37:40] lightly when we see a baby come into
[37:42] this world and you know I think that's
[37:44] just a beautiful thing that I I didn't
[37:46] really realize it when when sort of I
[37:49] was I guess a young adult the importance
[37:51] of celebrating a birthday
[37:53] because that's what it is it's the
[37:55] expression of God's own life
[37:57] Zoe God's own life on earth when you
[38:01] have a birth when you you have a
[38:03] birthday it's something to be celebrated
[38:04] so certainly a tremendous thing to see
[38:07] it happen once again
[38:09] we look forward to seeing the
[38:11] ojirabesses
[38:13] in due course
[38:15] you happy tonight
[38:17] I was looking at uh at my notes and it's
[38:19] been a while since I was here on a
[38:21] Wednesday and uh certainly thankful to
[38:23] be back on a Wednesday and hopefully
[38:26] maybe just a bit of a
[38:28] teaching
[38:29] a learning as we go I think that that's
[38:32] kind of what happens for me I I learn
[38:36] lots as I do this and
[38:37] you know I just can't help but talk a
[38:40] little bit about last Wednesday though
[38:41] last Wednesday was certainly a
[38:43] tremendous blessing thank you brother
[38:45] Emanuel that was uh so good it was
[38:48] spiritual food in due season
[38:50] and you know the the idea of there being
[38:52] a famine in the land I don't know if
[38:54] there's ever been a time where there's
[38:55] been such a famine in the land and you
[38:58] know it's not a famine for food because
[39:00] we can go and just head to Costco and
[39:03] buy the choices cuts of Alberta beef AAA
[39:07] Alberta beef if we don't want to do that
[39:10] likely we can just go and maybe stretch
[39:12] our budget a little bit and go to a real
[39:13] fine restaurant and treat ourselves we
[39:16] can go and eat just whatever we want to
[39:18] in this world and uh that's not what the
[39:22] famine is for the feminists for the
[39:24] desire to hear the word of God to hear
[39:27] the person of Jesus Christ because if we
[39:30] can accept the fullness of the word in
[39:32] our day that's truly what we're doing is
[39:34] accepting and welcoming Jesus Christ as
[39:37] we heard about on on Sunday
[39:39] and we certainly wouldn't want to
[39:41] welcome Jesus to invite Jesus to our
[39:44] lives and to our homes and to our
[39:46] service but then have something said
[39:48] where we would have to just full stop
[39:50] hit the brakes and say no I just can't
[39:52] take that if it's according to the word
[39:55] then we're not just rejecting the
[39:57] minister if we do that brothers and
[39:59] sisters
[40:01] I just think it's such a beautiful thing
[40:03] though in the midst of a famine a famine
[40:05] for the hearing of the word of God that
[40:07] we can still have a feast
[40:09] we can still be feasting on that word
[40:11] and you know all of the inspiration that
[40:14] I have will come from the message of the
[40:16] hour and I mean the word of God is the
[40:20] message of the hour so when we look at
[40:21] the Bible the the the prophet the man
[40:24] the only thing that he did was amplify
[40:26] the Bible he tied up the Loose Ends that
[40:29] were in the Bible according to tradition
[40:31] but that's that's the feast that we have
[40:34] in the midst of this famine it's such a
[40:36] beautiful thing and what it's going to
[40:38] do for us is give us rapturing Faith
[40:40] because the Rapture is Faith it takes
[40:43] Faith to have the Rapture it takes Faith
[40:46] to have salvation we can't just go to
[40:48] the store and buy salvation some people
[40:51] would say well you can pay you can pay
[40:53] the church if you pay your tithes enough
[40:55] the right way at the right times you can
[40:58] actually get your salvation but we know
[40:59] that that's the Beast system and it
[41:02] started as a simple discussion and and
[41:04] then it crept into the church unawares
[41:06] and it became a Doctrine and and then it
[41:09] turned into the the horse riders that
[41:12] wound up Galloping through the church
[41:13] throughout the ages and we're not going
[41:15] to go too far into that tonight but you
[41:17] can in some some religions some circles
[41:20] you can certainly buy religion but you
[41:22] can't do that according to the Bible
[41:24] it takes Faith to have salvation and
[41:27] salvation truly is the only covering
[41:29] that we want and that covering is the
[41:31] blood of Jesus Christ according to his
[41:33] word for our day but you know there is a
[41:35] tremendous feast in the midst of this
[41:37] famine for the word of God and we're
[41:39] here just feasting on it tonight I trust
[41:41] that's why we've come so we can feast
[41:43] tonight and you know brother Emanuel
[41:46] said it last week I just have to just
[41:49] amplify these notes because they're so
[41:51] powerful they're so important that God
[41:54] always provides for his own
[41:56] he will always provide a way for his own
[41:59] we heard this story example after
[42:02] example last week about how God always
[42:04] provides for his own the woman with the
[42:07] oil we know Elijah with the birds in
[42:11] even in the midst of the famine he
[42:12] called for
[42:14] I won't go too far into all of that we
[42:16] know the woman that that she came out of
[42:18] her house and and in Samaria and she was
[42:20] just going to go and create the last
[42:22] meal she had two sticks representing the
[42:24] cross brother random said she was just
[42:26] gonna put those sticks together and and
[42:28] cook the last little bit of food they
[42:29] had and that was it they were gonna die
[42:31] because of this famine but she was
[42:33] willing to take the word of God over the
[42:37] natural
[42:38] circumstances in her life and that saved
[42:41] her life if she would have said no
[42:44] I'm not interested in what this man's
[42:46] gonna tell me because to her it was a
[42:48] man right it was a man speaking it
[42:51] wasn't an angel with wings and a halo
[42:53] over his head he didn't even have a
[42:55] pillar of fire for her to see what she
[42:57] saw was a man and you know God always
[43:00] uses men and I think that's what we want
[43:02] to get into tonight to talk about but
[43:04] she took the words of God through the
[43:08] man and saved her life saved her son and
[43:11] we know that the famine ended for her at
[43:14] that moment and it does for everyone
[43:16] spiritually when we're willing to put
[43:17] the word of God ahead of our own
[43:19] thoughts our own thinking even sometimes
[43:22] our own desires
[43:25] one one other thought that brother
[43:27] Emmanuel said this one's kind of for I
[43:29] would say anyone you know you're going
[43:31] to be here if you're going to come here
[43:32] you might as well have a good time
[43:34] otherwise why do you come why would you
[43:37] come to church if you're not going to
[43:39] have a good time I I just thought that
[43:41] was so good
[43:42] you know there's things that we need to
[43:43] be conscious of we need to know we need
[43:46] to be aware of and I just think it
[43:48] Blends so good with what we want to talk
[43:50] about tonight you know but we need to be
[43:52] teaching sound Doctrine and and you know
[43:55] people were given to fables that's what
[43:57] the word of God says if we're not
[43:58] careful we will be given over to fables
[44:00] we'll we'll take the word of God and
[44:02] make it something we could even take the
[44:04] message of the hour and make it a fable
[44:05] and how would we do that brother Barry I
[44:08] would say this we could make the stories
[44:10] about the prophet more important than
[44:12] the message that the prophet brought
[44:14] brought we could say that you know the
[44:17] the the storm mountain or or any of the
[44:20] different stories that happens if that
[44:21] becomes our focus and we don't actually
[44:24] follow what the message is that he
[44:26] taught then we're gonna miss the truth
[44:28] and we can actually be given over to a
[44:30] fable we can be given over to something
[44:32] that's not sound Doctrine and we need to
[44:34] be very careful because the devil
[44:35] doesn't care how religious we get in
[44:37] fact the devil would like us if we got
[44:38] real religious if we got way more
[44:40] religious than we need to be but I've
[44:41] heard it said probably said it before
[44:43] that we can become so Heavenly minded
[44:45] that we become no earthly good
[44:47] well I could sit at home and read the
[44:49] Bible all day and come up with all kinds
[44:51] of different quotes and not go out and
[44:52] provide a living for my family I'm worse
[44:54] than an infidel
[44:56] we've got to be able to provide for our
[44:57] family and we know brother Barry you've
[44:59] got to be able to provide for your
[45:00] family spiritually you surely do but
[45:02] your children don't understand no milk
[45:04] in the fridge the children don't
[45:06] understand when you don't have bread in
[45:07] the cupboard the children have got to
[45:09] eat and there's only one person that's
[45:11] responsible for that it's not Mama's
[45:13] responsibility it's Daddy's
[45:15] responsibility he's the one responsible
[45:17] for the natural food and the spiritual
[45:19] food to prove that there isn't a famine
[45:22] in the land naturally or spiritually
[45:23] because we heard it said last week and I
[45:25] said it already that God always provides
[45:27] a way for his own always
[45:30] sometimes it's not exactly the way we
[45:31] would want sometimes we can't go out and
[45:33] just get that big fat steak the way we
[45:35] would like it sometimes we have to eat
[45:37] little peanut butter and jam on bread or
[45:41] brown beans by the canful sometimes
[45:44] that's the way life is
[45:45] and it's important to never take it for
[45:47] granted if God has truly blessed us
[45:52] the last note from last week that I want
[45:54] to say there's one truth in the midst of
[45:56] a million Fables
[45:58] so many fables in this life
[46:00] and and Satan loves it when we get all
[46:02] caught up in all the different things
[46:04] but anyways I just really enjoyed that
[46:06] last week I've really been enjoying
[46:08] hearing the ministry
[46:10] um sort of taking every other week and
[46:14] just being able to see what the Lord has
[46:16] on each other's Hearts you know it
[46:18] really does something for the body I
[46:20] believe so God bless you brethren for
[46:22] bringing of your sacred portion I know
[46:24] it's not easy when you're working when
[46:26] you're employed and uh
[46:29] still bringing of your
[46:31] your time and your energy it's a
[46:33] wonderful thing so the last time that we
[46:36] got together I just I just talked about
[46:38] a little bit about knowledge and I'm
[46:40] just gonna do a quick recap and then
[46:42] sort of push forwards a little bit
[46:44] um we talked about knowledge uh out of
[46:47] the church age book of of the word
[46:50] coming from Smyrna meaning bitter it
[46:53] didn't come from Smyrna but the church
[46:55] age Smyrna was was all about knowledge
[46:58] being derived from the word myrrh myrrh
[47:01] was used in embalming the Dead Brother
[47:03] Adam says thus we have a two-folded
[47:05] significance found in the name of this
[47:06] age it was a bitter age filled with
[47:08] death
[47:09] the two Vines within the framework of
[47:11] the church were drifting further apart
[47:13] with an increased bitterness toward the
[47:15] True Vine on the part of the false
[47:18] death was not only the seed of the false
[47:21] Vine but even in the True Vine there was
[47:24] a creeping paralysis and impotence
[47:27] because they had already drifted from
[47:30] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[47:33] years after Pentecost
[47:36] this is the kind of the key that I
[47:38] wanted to to get to speaking about
[47:40] knowledge brother Branham says
[47:42] and no True Believer is any stronger and
[47:46] spiritually healthy and alive
[47:48] than his knowledge of and adherence to
[47:53] the pure word of God
[47:55] and what is the pure word of God in our
[47:57] day
[47:58] it's the word of the message of the hour
[48:01] the seventh angel message it's not the
[48:04] seventh angel messenger it's the seventh
[48:06] angel message and the seventh angel
[48:08] message pointed to Christ that's what
[48:11] the seventh angel message is it is
[48:14] Christ for the problem goes on to see as
[48:16] seen by multitudes of examples in the
[48:18] Old Testament organization was growing a
[48:21] pace confirming and augmenting the death
[48:23] of the membership for the Holy Ghost
[48:25] leadership was deposed
[48:28] and the Word was replaced by Creeds
[48:31] dogmas and man-made ritual
[48:34] in the message of the hour in the church
[48:36] age book brother Branham talks about I
[48:38] think it's an Ephesian Church age he
[48:40] says you know what they did where they
[48:42] got wrong was they actually said quick
[48:45] now that we've got this tremendous work
[48:47] of the of God Mighty wonders and works
[48:50] we need to quickly get around it and
[48:51] Surround it and protect it we need to
[48:53] protect this word and and doing so what
[48:56] you do is you put a period at the end of
[48:58] the sentence and you stop the Holy Ghost
[49:00] right there there's no protection needed
[49:03] for the word of God he will protect his
[49:05] own word just like we don't need to
[49:06] bring it to pass he vindicates his own
[49:09] word by bringing it to pass himself the
[49:12] only thing we need to do is follow his
[49:13] word
[49:15] and we know that Paul said even if an
[49:16] angel
[49:17] come and preach any other gospel
[49:20] any other gospel let him be accursed
[49:23] just wait a second let me say it again
[49:25] he says if any Angel even an angel from
[49:29] heaven comes and preaches any other
[49:31] gospel than what we've already preached
[49:33] let him be accursed how important it is
[49:37] for us to remain with the pure word for
[49:39] our day last week or last time we talked
[49:42] about a scripture in Jeremiah and I
[49:45] think it's it's wonderful for me it was
[49:47] astounding actually because we talked
[49:48] about all the times in Jeremiah that he
[49:51] talks about pastors and every single
[49:52] time except for one he talks about
[49:54] pastors they're not good people they're
[49:57] bad people and the reason for that is
[49:58] they've strayed from the pure word they
[50:01] would not listen to the word of God and
[50:03] where was the word of God in the days of
[50:04] Jeremiah it was in the mouth of the
[50:07] prophets
[50:08] he's the same yesterday today and
[50:10] forever he doesn't change he's as
[50:12] immutable in his nature as he is in his
[50:14] ways but we know that time
[50:17] time passes by and Satan gets in through
[50:20] Creeds and dogmas and traditions and
[50:22] gets people to start to hear another
[50:25] idea and think another thought and then
[50:27] another tradition gets handed down and
[50:29] it's ever slight and and so so subtle if
[50:33] you've ever studied erosion sometimes
[50:36] it's really significant and fantastic
[50:39] but most of the time erosion is very
[50:42] very slow so slow I'm certainly not an
[50:45] expert in it but just to bring the
[50:46] points this is totally off off the main
[50:49] road here but have you ever look at
[50:51] stalactites and stalagmites I think I
[50:54] said those right they're they're calcium
[50:56] and and mineral deposits deposited from
[51:00] drips of water sometimes we'll see
[51:02] icicles where we live here and the ice
[51:05] the water starts to run and it freezes
[51:07] and it runs it melts it drips and it
[51:09] freezes and it creates an icicle but it
[51:12] you know when that happens over a period
[51:14] of time maybe a few days you'll see an
[51:15] icicle here with the temperature and
[51:17] water but when you look at minerals and
[51:20] how they will actually create a mineral
[51:22] deposit that's a rock it's a stone
[51:26] how does that happen it's so subtle it's
[51:29] so slow the process is very very little
[51:32] almost microscopic and it will just grow
[51:36] and grow and grow and it can happen that
[51:38] way so subtle you won't hear a sound you
[51:41] might hear a little tiny drip maybe but
[51:44] maybe not maybe the water will just
[51:45] evaporate at the end of it just like
[51:47] water will freeze on an icicle but yet
[51:49] that deposit is still there and the same
[51:51] thing happens with the word of God if we
[51:53] don't keep it exactly true if we just
[51:57] allow something to get in just a little
[51:59] deviation before long we have a deposit
[52:02] and it starts to grow and grow and grow
[52:05] I remember we talked about it before if
[52:07] you don't weed your garden and get them
[52:08] when they're small they grow into big
[52:11] nasty things we did it last year and we
[52:12] had a garden Full Of Weeds and our food
[52:15] but we had to go in and do the harder
[52:17] work and pull out the big bushes and
[52:20] save the food but if we would have just
[52:22] got after it when they were tiny and
[52:23] small if I would have it probably would
[52:26] have been real easy this year we get a
[52:28] redo it's going to be different this
[52:30] year is going to be different but
[52:31] talking about Jeremiah and that one
[52:33] scripture in Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15
[52:36] and I will give you pastors according to
[52:38] mine heart which shall feed you with
[52:42] knowledge and understanding
[52:45] I think it's astounding because he
[52:48] doesn't say revelation
[52:50] it's not Revelation the pastor is not
[52:52] going to give you Revelation just like
[52:54] we read in First Peter chapter chapter 3
[52:56] verse 7 likewise he husbands dwell with
[52:58] them according to knowledge
[53:01] not revelation
[53:03] so there has to be instructions
[53:04] somewhere along the way there has to be
[53:07] teaching there has to be learning there
[53:09] has to be understanding and I would say
[53:11] the understanding comes through
[53:13] Revelation according to the word
[53:15] otherwise how else could a woman in this
[53:18] age submit to her husband
[53:21] how else could a husband not get bitter
[53:24] towards his wife
[53:27] we have to follow the word and when we
[53:28] have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we have
[53:30] the ability to do that but Jeremiah is
[53:33] talking about a pastor and I will give
[53:34] you pastors according to mine heart
[53:36] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[53:38] understanding and we know that brother
[53:39] Branham says every scripture has a
[53:40] compound meaning and Revelation so this
[53:42] scripture it applies to the children of
[53:45] Israel that there will be truth among
[53:46] the false I know that was the actual
[53:48] snapshot that was the the moment that
[53:50] the scripture was written under
[53:51] inspiration but it also applies to
[53:53] another people it also applies to a
[53:55] different time and age because the word
[53:57] of God
[53:58] is Everlasting
[54:01] I will give you pastors according to
[54:02] mine heart which shall feed you with
[54:04] knowledge and understanding
[54:07] moving on
[54:10] brother Branham says in the in the
[54:11] church age book to never let anything
[54:13] get between you and that word
[54:16] never let anything get between you and
[54:18] that word
[54:20] I think that's so important those words
[54:22] are vital because we could easily let
[54:25] something get between us and that word I
[54:27] know I've had times in my life where I
[54:29] get really upset with someone who is a
[54:31] Believer really upset with someone who
[54:34] is a Believer I feel like they stepped
[54:35] right on my toes they they kicked me
[54:37] they spit on me I've been done wrong and
[54:39] I know I've been done wrong and this the
[54:42] devil's right there say and see look
[54:45] what they did to you are they really
[54:46] Believers is there any truth to it might
[54:48] as well forget it you know you know
[54:50] where your friends are you could just
[54:51] come and and dine you could just come
[54:53] and do everything that you used you know
[54:54] you just start down that road no I don't
[54:57] think so but Satan's always there trying
[55:00] to get us
[55:02] to let something get between us and that
[55:04] word
[55:05] and that's why I think it's so important
[55:06] if we have the the teaching according to
[55:09] knowledge and understanding about the
[55:11] word and our position according to the
[55:13] word and the message of the hour it can
[55:15] help us it can give us something to
[55:17] actually think about when these times
[55:19] come up in our lives maybe in our
[55:21] marriages maybe in our relationships
[55:23] with friends maybe with our
[55:24] relationships at school or at work with
[55:26] employers it can actually help us
[55:29] and don't get me wrong I'm not trying to
[55:31] go down a psychological Road psychology
[55:33] isn't going to help us the word of God
[55:34] will help us the spirit of Jesus Christ
[55:37] will help us
[55:39] but you know I've heard it said and I I
[55:40] think it's true there's a lot of times
[55:42] in our lives that we do have natural
[55:43] problems that will spiritualize
[55:46] and and by spiritualizing it it's a
[55:48] trick of the devil to get us to miss
[55:50] what the actual treatment for our
[55:52] problem is it can be a whole lot simpler
[55:55] than maybe what we think it is and
[55:58] sometimes when we have a problem in our
[55:59] lives the devil will come around and say
[56:00] oh it's this great big thing over here
[56:02] look at this great big thing over here
[56:04] when it's actually nothing maybe you
[56:06] just pulled a muscle or something but
[56:08] Satan's gonna say oh no you've got
[56:09] cancer
[56:11] you've got something tremendous we heard
[56:13] brother Cadre say it he had a sweet tea
[56:15] and went in to have his eyes checked at
[56:17] one time and the doctor said no you've
[56:18] got you you've got diabetes
[56:21] I mean no what he said it was a trap
[56:23] right if he would have said oh do I
[56:25] then perhaps he could have opened the
[56:27] door to get it didn't mean he would get
[56:28] it the doctor can't put nothing on you
[56:32] but what's our mental attitude
[56:35] anyways brother Bradham says never let
[56:37] anything get between you and the word in
[56:38] the church age book he says I am the
[56:40] word if you want deity in your midst
[56:42] then welcome and receive the word
[56:45] don't ever let anyone
[56:47] or anything
[56:49] get between you and that word
[56:53] this which I am giving you the word is a
[56:56] revelation of myself
[56:59] I am the word remember that
[57:03] I think it's so beautiful the way he's
[57:04] wrote this because some people would say
[57:06] well this is Brother Branham now he's
[57:08] making himself God no no this is the
[57:10] Holy Ghost speaking to you brother
[57:11] Branham
[57:12] this is Anointed words to The Bride of
[57:15] Jesus Christ
[57:17] to he that hath an ear let him hear what
[57:19] the spirit saith unto the church
[57:22] then he goes on to say I wonder if we
[57:24] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[57:25] in our midst
[57:28] he says let me give you a thought here
[57:30] and this is where I left off last week
[57:32] and so this is where I'm going to pick
[57:33] up this week
[57:35] let me give you a thought here brother
[57:36] Branham says to me I think that's just
[57:38] beautiful but before we get there we'll
[57:40] just talk about a couple other things
[57:42] you know this this the scripture we read
[57:44] in First Peter chapter 3 verse 7 dwell
[57:47] with them according to knowledge it's
[57:48] not talking about Revelation it's
[57:50] knowledge so it's something that we've
[57:52] learned somewhere along the way someone
[57:53] had to instruct us or teach us this we
[57:56] needed to understand this otherwise why
[57:58] would it even be written why would we
[58:00] see it in the scripture in First Peter
[58:02] chapter three why would it say verse one
[58:05] likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[58:07] your own husbands
[58:09] there has to be an instruction there has
[58:11] to be a teaching there has to be an
[58:13] understanding and a learning and then we
[58:16] can thereby live it but if we don't hear
[58:18] it if we don't get taught then how will
[58:21] we ever understand it
[58:24] I think it's just a wonderful thing
[58:27] but I said it earlier sometimes we can
[58:29] over spiritualize things and and make it
[58:32] maybe different than what it actually is
[58:34] and and I think it's beautiful I was
[58:36] thinking about it today just meditating
[58:38] on it and some might call it super
[58:40] spiritual and you know what it it might
[58:42] be or maybe it's just over spiritualized
[58:45] but you know
[58:48] um either way we need to remember that
[58:50] Jesus is the word
[58:52] we just need to remember also that we
[58:54] don't want to be so Heavenly minded that
[58:55] we're not worthy good we have to find
[58:57] that balance and through the Holy Ghost
[58:59] In Our Lives he's going to give us the
[59:00] ability to do that we're going to be
[59:02] able to be a husband to our wives and
[59:04] and a mother to our children and a wife
[59:06] to our husband and a brother to our
[59:09] sister and and and husbands will be able
[59:12] to dwell with our wives without getting
[59:14] a root of bitterness in our lives
[59:17] because that's what the word says I keep
[59:18] saying that I know but it's just what
[59:20] the word says and I I don't know why I
[59:22] keep saying it but maybe someone has a
[59:24] root of bitterness I don't know if you
[59:26] do the word says that you could it's not
[59:29] abnormal to get it but you got to get it
[59:31] out
[59:32] you can't have a root of bitterness if
[59:34] you do that it's going to go deep and
[59:37] it's going to go far we were talking
[59:39] about different kinds of roots Isaac is
[59:41] studying trees plants in school and
[59:43] we're helping them study and to talk
[59:45] about the different types of roots
[59:46] sometimes they'll just go underneath the
[59:48] surface just a little bit below the
[59:50] surface but they'll travel a long ways
[59:52] man and other ones will just go straight
[59:54] down and real deep but they won't grow
[59:56] they won't see the tree or plant grow
[59:58] it'll just have a tremendous root
[1:00:00] underneath the surface and to try and
[1:00:02] get it out it can stay there man you
[1:00:04] won't be able to get it out of there
[1:00:05] we got to be careful there is a root of
[1:00:08] bitterness we can have it towards a wife
[1:00:09] we can have it towards a brother or
[1:00:11] sister we can have a root of bitterness
[1:00:12] towards our parents we don't want to
[1:00:14] have a root of bitterness if it gets in
[1:00:16] there you got to get rid of it you got
[1:00:17] to get it out and the word gives us the
[1:00:19] ability to do that and I so appreciate
[1:00:21] that and I just want to say this
[1:00:23] brothers and sisters if I ever say
[1:00:25] anything to you from the pulpit
[1:00:27] and it it it feels like I'm stepping on
[1:00:30] your toes or maybe I upset you
[1:00:33] there's a way to deal with that don't
[1:00:34] let it turn into a root of bitterness
[1:00:36] I'm a human and I know that I will make
[1:00:38] mistakes I'll fall down flat on my face
[1:00:40] and and you know what I'm sorry
[1:00:43] I'll say that I apologize
[1:00:46] I don't want to make excuses I just want
[1:00:48] to say I'm sorry and you know what the
[1:00:49] word of God gives us an Avenue for that
[1:00:51] if it happens come and talk to me
[1:00:55] I will not dismiss you and say I'm
[1:00:57] better than you I hold an office that's
[1:01:00] that's that's totally opposite if if
[1:01:03] there's a root of bitterness developing
[1:01:04] between anyone the word of God gives us
[1:01:06] the solution for that and that's to go
[1:01:08] to your brother
[1:01:09] go to your sister nip it in the bud so
[1:01:13] to speak get that root before it
[1:01:15] actually takes root because if it takes
[1:01:16] root you might never be able to get rid
[1:01:18] of it brothers and sisters it might be
[1:01:19] with you your whole life that might turn
[1:01:21] into the thorn in your flesh and
[1:01:23] sometimes that can be really terrible
[1:01:25] but sometimes we can be super spiritual
[1:01:27] or over spiritualized things either way
[1:01:29] we need to remember that Jesus is the
[1:01:31] word for our day that's the word that
[1:01:33] we're talking about is Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] says don't ever let anyone or anything
[1:01:38] get between you and that word this which
[1:01:41] I am giving you the word is a revelation
[1:01:44] of myself I am the word he says remember
[1:01:48] that
[1:01:50] he also says I wonder if we are
[1:01:51] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:01:54] our midst
[1:01:56] let me give you a thought here
[1:01:58] how do we pray
[1:02:01] how do we pray he says and I just can't
[1:02:04] help but think you know this just it
[1:02:06] goes so good with what we talked about
[1:02:08] on Sunday how do we pray brothers and
[1:02:10] sisters do we just pray we had a brother
[1:02:14] share that quote from from that message
[1:02:17] that we talked about Pride the brother
[1:02:20] Branham talked about he said you know
[1:02:21] how are we praying do we get in the
[1:02:23] spirit when we pray talks about it in
[1:02:25] the church age book do we get in the
[1:02:26] spirit
[1:02:27] we can get in the spirit for a ball game
[1:02:28] and we can get in the spirit for all
[1:02:30] these other things but do we truly get
[1:02:31] in the spirit if we don't get in the
[1:02:33] spirit God's not even going to be
[1:02:34] hearing us we're just going to be
[1:02:35] hearing ourselves talk we're going to be
[1:02:37] saying a prayer and brother Brad I'm in
[1:02:39] that message he says I wish that we
[1:02:40] would just let loose that we would just
[1:02:42] stop trying to pray and just pray and
[1:02:45] actually just speak to God let him speak
[1:02:47] through us to him that's the only way
[1:02:50] we're going to reach him is to allow him
[1:02:52] to speak to him and you know I'm getting
[1:02:55] ahead of myself but in the it is the
[1:02:57] rising of the sun it's the word to the
[1:03:00] word brothers and sisters that's what
[1:03:01] we're talking about today that's the
[1:03:03] message of the hour today it's the word
[1:03:05] to the word it's not us to the word it's
[1:03:08] not us and the word it's the word Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ himself in our lives and boy when
[1:03:14] he starts to pray I guarantee you
[1:03:15] brothers and sisters if you've never
[1:03:17] broken through you've never seen that
[1:03:18] experience it will be Earth shattering
[1:03:21] for you if you have never prayed to the
[1:03:23] point where you have been able to break
[1:03:24] through it's like breaking through the
[1:03:26] sound barrier with a jet and it makes no
[1:03:29] sound but what will happen is you'll
[1:03:31] find that maybe you're almost feeling
[1:03:32] like you're not even in your body and
[1:03:34] someone else is speaking if you've never
[1:03:36] experienced it I highly recommend it and
[1:03:38] I trust that everyone here has heard it
[1:03:39] and experienced it and we can just move
[1:03:41] on but I just feel we had to get here
[1:03:43] tonight brother around him he says it
[1:03:45] let me give you a thought here how do we
[1:03:47] pray we pray in Jesus name don't we
[1:03:50] every prayer is in his name or there
[1:03:53] isn't any answer
[1:03:55] it's only in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:58] we remember this story brother Bonham
[1:04:00] told not making it a fable going back on
[1:04:02] what I said but just to demonstrate the
[1:04:04] power how they were one time levitating
[1:04:07] a table
[1:04:08] and brother Branham said you want to
[1:04:10] challenge me in the name of Jesus and in
[1:04:12] the doctrine of water baptism okay let's
[1:04:13] talk about it then let's throw that
[1:04:16] table down in the name of the father
[1:04:18] let's throw that table down in the name
[1:04:19] of the son they were levitating a table
[1:04:21] this was demonic let's let's let's smash
[1:04:25] that table down in the name of the Holy
[1:04:27] Ghost and nothing happened
[1:04:30] but then what did he do he said in the
[1:04:32] name of Jesus Christ and that table
[1:04:34] smashed to the floor there's only one
[1:04:36] thing that has the power in this
[1:04:38] universe and that is the name of Jesus
[1:04:41] Christ because we know Jesus Christ is
[1:04:43] not a second person or a third person in
[1:04:46] the Trinity of God he is the person he
[1:04:50] is God
[1:04:51] himself
[1:04:53] how do we pray we pray in Jesus name
[1:04:56] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[1:04:59] there isn't any answer
[1:05:03] he says yet
[1:05:05] in first John 5 14 we are told this is
[1:05:08] the confidence that we have in him that
[1:05:11] if we ask anything according to his will
[1:05:13] he heareth us
[1:05:15] and if we know that he hear us
[1:05:17] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[1:05:21] the petitions that we desired of him
[1:05:25] now we ask what is the will of God
[1:05:30] I think I talked about this a while ago
[1:05:33] it's such an important thing for us to
[1:05:35] understand
[1:05:36] according to knowledge what is the will
[1:05:39] of God as a husband what is the will of
[1:05:42] God as a wife what is the will of God as
[1:05:44] a son or a daughter
[1:05:46] the will of God is his word brother
[1:05:48] Branham says now we ask what is the will
[1:05:50] of God there is only one way to know his
[1:05:53] will and that is by the word of God
[1:05:57] so there has to be a teaching there's
[1:05:59] got to be instruction
[1:06:00] and how can they instruct if someone
[1:06:03] doesn't actually speak that word of God
[1:06:06] you know brothers and sisters we're
[1:06:07] living not in the first pull age we're
[1:06:09] not living in a second full age we're
[1:06:10] living in a third pole age and that's a
[1:06:13] a different word a different way to say
[1:06:15] it but we're living in the age of the
[1:06:16] third poll we're living in the
[1:06:18] dispensation of all of the ages the
[1:06:21] bride age we're we're moving into a
[1:06:24] different place into a different cycle
[1:06:25] and it is truly the word of God and what
[1:06:29] makes this word of God live brothers and
[1:06:30] sisters is when it's on our lips
[1:06:33] we can think it all we want we can think
[1:06:35] the name of Jesus Christ all we want but
[1:06:37] if we don't speak the name of Jesus
[1:06:41] is there power does he hear our prayers
[1:06:45] Lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith
[1:06:48] and it cometh to pass when the Lord
[1:06:51] commandeth it not
[1:06:53] brother Branham says there it is if it
[1:06:55] isn't in the word
[1:06:57] you can't have it
[1:06:59] I think it's so easy it's so simple it's
[1:07:02] so beautiful if it ain't in the word of
[1:07:04] God you can't have it
[1:07:06] it makes it real clear makes it real
[1:07:08] easy it's cut and dried right it's right
[1:07:11] or wrong it's one or zero it's either or
[1:07:17] there it is if it isn't in the word you
[1:07:20] can't have it
[1:07:21] so we can't ask unless it's in the word
[1:07:24] and we can't petition or ask unless it's
[1:07:26] in his name
[1:07:28] but I want to say brothers and sisters
[1:07:30] boy oh boy if we actually understand
[1:07:32] according to knowledge if we have been
[1:07:35] instructed if we have been taught
[1:07:36] according to the word for our day the
[1:07:39] message of the hour then when we do ask
[1:07:41] if it's in Jesus name then we have full
[1:07:45] Authority and power because we're not
[1:07:47] doing it at that point we say Lord
[1:07:49] according to your word just like a child
[1:07:52] would say but Daddy remember you said
[1:07:54] remember you said you would do this
[1:07:57] I remember brother Ken teaching it
[1:07:59] there's nothing sweeter for the Lord to
[1:08:00] hear than his word on our lips repeating
[1:08:04] his word back to him when we can do that
[1:08:07] brothers and sisters in prayer boy
[1:08:10] that's where it becomes omnipotent
[1:08:12] because when we're speaking his word
[1:08:14] back to him we're not even speaking it's
[1:08:16] him speaking it's the word to the word
[1:08:18] again it's so beautiful brother Bradham
[1:08:20] says there it is if it if it isn't in
[1:08:23] the word you can't have it so we can't
[1:08:26] ask unless it's in the word and we can't
[1:08:28] petition or ask unless it's in his name
[1:08:33] there it is again
[1:08:35] Jesus the name
[1:08:37] is
[1:08:39] the word will
[1:08:42] you can't separate God in the word they
[1:08:45] are one
[1:08:48] I hope this is helping somehow tonight I
[1:08:50] just think it's so beautiful the way
[1:08:52] brother Branham says it you cannot
[1:08:54] separate Jesus
[1:08:57] and the word
[1:08:59] Jesus the name is the word will
[1:09:06] you can't separate God in the word they
[1:09:08] are one that's out of the exposition of
[1:09:10] the seven Church ages the pergamian
[1:09:12] church age
[1:09:14] turn over with me to John
[1:09:17] Saint John chapter 1.
[1:09:24] just for a little further discussion
[1:09:27] about the word
[1:09:32] I think it's such a an amazing thought
[1:09:34] here we'll just read from verse 1.
[1:09:37] of Saint John chapter 1.
[1:09:44] in the beginning was the word
[1:09:47] and the Word was God and the word
[1:09:50] sorry the word was with God and the Word
[1:09:52] was God
[1:09:54] we know many times people will take that
[1:09:56] scripture verse 1 and and put it
[1:09:59] together with verse 14 the first half of
[1:10:01] verse 14.
[1:10:03] we're just going to read it all tonight
[1:10:04] there's a lot in between there
[1:10:06] verse 2 says the same was in the
[1:10:09] beginning with God
[1:10:11] all things were made by him and without
[1:10:14] him was not anything made that was made
[1:10:16] in him was life
[1:10:18] and the life was the light of men
[1:10:25] and the light shineth in darkness
[1:10:28] and the Darkness
[1:10:30] comprehended it not
[1:10:33] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:10:35] was John
[1:10:36] the same came for a witness to Bear
[1:10:39] witness of the light that all men
[1:10:42] through him might believe
[1:10:44] he was not that light but was sent to
[1:10:47] Bear witness of that light
[1:10:50] that was the True Light which lighteth
[1:10:52] every man that cometh into the world
[1:10:55] he was in the world and the world was
[1:10:57] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:11:00] he came unto his own and his own
[1:11:03] received him not but as many as received
[1:11:05] him
[1:11:06] to them
[1:11:08] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:11:12] even to them that believe on his name
[1:11:16] I just think these next couple verses
[1:11:17] are so beautiful
[1:11:19] verse 13 which were not born which were
[1:11:23] born sorry not of blood nor the will of
[1:11:25] the flesh nor the will of man but of God
[1:11:30] born again
[1:11:31] verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and
[1:11:35] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[1:11:38] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:11:41] father full of grace
[1:11:43] and Truth
[1:11:46] I just think that it's a an amazing
[1:11:49] thing here just to look at a couple of
[1:11:51] scriptures in here but just to give the
[1:11:54] the whole sort of spectrum of this
[1:11:56] thought that that God came in a man so
[1:12:00] that he could actually Bear witness of
[1:12:03] himself God came in word form exactly
[1:12:08] according to what the prophecy in Isaiah
[1:12:10] was the people were looking for
[1:12:12] something different to happen sure they
[1:12:14] believed that the diversion was going to
[1:12:16] see conceive but it would have to be a
[1:12:18] different virgin it couldn't be that one
[1:12:20] it would have to be some way but it
[1:12:23] would be a different way they they
[1:12:24] couldn't understand how anything could
[1:12:26] come out of Nazareth that that it was
[1:12:28] supposed to be out of Bethlehem they
[1:12:29] they wouldn't believe that he came in a
[1:12:31] stable they wouldn't believe that he he
[1:12:34] would be born the way that he was born
[1:12:35] at all they said that he was actually
[1:12:37] fathered by a Roman soldier some
[1:12:40] ridiculous thing like that but here we
[1:12:43] have John saying that you know what in
[1:12:45] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:12:48] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:12:50] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:12:53] just explains it so clearly here that
[1:12:55] this was not just a man this was God
[1:12:59] but how was he revealed to the world
[1:13:01] nobody knew who he was his mom knew that
[1:13:04] he had a fantastic life and his aunt and
[1:13:08] and uncle they knew something was
[1:13:11] special about him because they knew that
[1:13:13] their baby left to life their baby was a
[1:13:15] stillborn baby according to what the
[1:13:17] prophet of God said but at the
[1:13:18] salutation of the word Jesus he left in
[1:13:22] the womb and we know the word of God
[1:13:23] says he was given the holy ghost at that
[1:13:25] moment he had the Holy Ghost in his womb
[1:13:27] that's what gave him the life he was no
[1:13:29] longer a stillborn baby
[1:13:31] but here we have a man that was sent
[1:13:34] from God whose name was John
[1:13:37] the same came for a witness to Bear
[1:13:40] witness of the light that all men
[1:13:43] through him might believe
[1:13:46] now we're talking about Jesus Christ the
[1:13:48] same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:50] he chooses men to reveal the word for
[1:13:54] their day
[1:13:55] he doesn't send an angel with a a
[1:13:58] trumpet and a and a big Heavenly Host to
[1:14:01] reveal the the word for the age he uses
[1:14:04] a man
[1:14:07] verse 7 says the same came for a witness
[1:14:09] to Bear witness of the light
[1:14:11] that all men through him might believe
[1:14:16] I think it's so important so beautiful
[1:14:18] to look at verse 8.
[1:14:21] he was not that light
[1:14:23] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:14:25] light
[1:14:26] he was not that light and we could say
[1:14:28] the same thing about William Mary and
[1:14:30] Branham he was not that light but he was
[1:14:33] sent to Bear witness of that light
[1:14:36] and what was John bearing witness of he
[1:14:39] was bearing witness of Jesus Christ the
[1:14:41] same yesterday today and forever today
[1:14:43] the whole world is looking for a
[1:14:45] manifestation of Jesus but we know the
[1:14:47] word of God says that we're going to
[1:14:49] meet him in the air we're not going to
[1:14:50] meet him on the ground he's come on the
[1:14:52] ground
[1:14:53] but what they're looking for is not what
[1:14:55] they're going to find
[1:14:56] if they see Jesus the way they want to
[1:15:00] they're actually going to see him in
[1:15:01] Revelations chapter 19.
[1:15:03] but anyways what we're talking about is
[1:15:05] a man was sent to Bear witness of the
[1:15:08] light but he was not that light and we
[1:15:10] know they came and they grilled him and
[1:15:12] said who are you what what are you doing
[1:15:14] you know are you a prophet are you the
[1:15:17] Messiah are you the one what are you
[1:15:19] doing and he said I'm just simply
[1:15:20] bearing witness of that light I am a
[1:15:24] voice crying in the wilderness I'm just
[1:15:27] one crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[1:15:29] the way of the Lord and we know that he
[1:15:33] was forerunning the first coming of the
[1:15:35] Lord and we have a John bearing witness
[1:15:39] in our day not John the Baptist an
[1:15:42] anointing
[1:15:44] an anointing of a man that was sent to
[1:15:47] Bear witness of the light even though he
[1:15:49] wasn't the light
[1:15:51] verse 9 says that was the True Light
[1:15:53] which lighteth every man that cometh
[1:15:55] into the world
[1:15:56] he was in the world and the world was
[1:15:58] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:16:02] he came unto his own and his own
[1:16:04] received him not
[1:16:06] but as many as received him
[1:16:08] this is where it gets real good this is
[1:16:10] where it turns into I believe scripture
[1:16:12] for us brothers and sisters as many as
[1:16:14] received him to them gave he power to
[1:16:16] become the sons of God
[1:16:19] even to them that believe on his name
[1:16:23] which were not born they were born but
[1:16:25] not of blood
[1:16:27] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[1:16:29] will of man but of God
[1:16:31] something happened to them when they
[1:16:32] heard that name Jesus something left in
[1:16:35] their womb something changed the way
[1:16:37] they saw everything
[1:16:39] where I'm getting with all of this
[1:16:41] tonight brothers and sisters the only
[1:16:43] thing that's going to do us any good is
[1:16:44] the pure word and whether we want to
[1:16:47] exercise it in our homes as a husband or
[1:16:49] or live by it as a wife the only thing
[1:16:52] that's going to do it is the word of God
[1:16:54] and we need to speak the word of God we
[1:16:56] need to be willing to teach the word of
[1:16:58] God we need to be willing to be taught
[1:17:00] the word of God if we can't do all of
[1:17:03] that together then somehow some way
[1:17:05] we're not going to get the word of God
[1:17:09] people have to bear witness of this word
[1:17:11] and the only way we can bear witness of
[1:17:13] it is to speak it sure our lives bear
[1:17:16] witness of it we'll do business
[1:17:18] transactions that are good they're
[1:17:19] beneficial for everyone we won't take
[1:17:21] the upper hand and say I'm I'm going to
[1:17:23] score big on this business transaction
[1:17:25] nobody will know about it the believer
[1:17:27] is going to say no I can't just win big
[1:17:29] every time I can't just actually see
[1:17:31] someone lose and I win the the believer
[1:17:34] is going to say no no everyone's going
[1:17:36] to win we're not going to do any dirty
[1:17:38] deals we're going to make sure that
[1:17:39] everything is above board and everybody
[1:17:41] wins we're going to treat people right
[1:17:42] our lives are going to Bear witness but
[1:17:45] then there's coming a time where we'll
[1:17:46] have to speak the word of God God uses
[1:17:50] men to bring light into this world and
[1:17:53] we talked about this a while ago about
[1:17:54] how this light we talked about in the
[1:17:56] Gospel of John in the beginning
[1:17:59] God said let there be light out of
[1:18:01] Genesis that light it wasn't light from
[1:18:04] the sun it wasn't the light that we
[1:18:06] would consciously think about like
[1:18:08] somebody turn on a light switch and
[1:18:10] there was light the darkness scattered
[1:18:11] because there was light what he was
[1:18:13] saying was let there be life that's
[1:18:15] where he poured himself out from being
[1:18:17] Elohim into being from the self-existing
[1:18:20] one into actually being God where he
[1:18:23] could be worshiped that's what happened
[1:18:25] with that light and that's the light
[1:18:27] we're talking about here in John God
[1:18:29] uses man to bring the light and it's no
[1:18:32] different for us today when we take this
[1:18:34] word and put it on our lips when we take
[1:18:36] this word and put it into our hearts we
[1:18:38] bear record we bear witness of this
[1:18:40] light too and and as we bear witness of
[1:18:43] this light and this life what we do is
[1:18:46] we actually instruct by knowledge we
[1:18:48] actually teach because we're not living
[1:18:50] a life according to our own will
[1:18:52] according to our own means according
[1:18:54] given to our own Traditions what we do
[1:18:56] is we always when we're talking about
[1:18:58] this pure light this Pure Life this pure
[1:19:01] word if we're not letting anything get
[1:19:03] between us in this word like brother
[1:19:04] Bradham said what happens is we always
[1:19:06] humble ourselves to this word always
[1:19:08] always
[1:19:10] otherwise it's another Spirit brothers
[1:19:12] and sisters I don't mean to say it that
[1:19:14] sharply but we need to it's true only
[1:19:17] the Holy Ghost will humble oneself to
[1:19:20] the word of God
[1:19:21] any other thing any other action is
[1:19:24] another spirit
[1:19:25] brother Adam says it many times you know
[1:19:27] you might have a spirit he says I don't
[1:19:30] doubt that but it might not be the holy
[1:19:32] spirit because the Holy Spirit Bears
[1:19:34] record of itself he speaks of himself he
[1:19:36] lives out through himself he Bears
[1:19:38] record according to this word that John
[1:19:40] talked about here he he he he he lives
[1:19:44] according to this word
[1:19:46] doesn't give us Liberty to live above
[1:19:49] this word
[1:19:50] nobody lives above the ministry of the
[1:19:54] Prophet for their day
[1:19:55] and we certainly don't want to live
[1:19:57] below that because it's a privilege to
[1:20:00] understand who we are
[1:20:02] John was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:20:05] light but he was not that light
[1:20:07] I just couldn't help but think about
[1:20:09] this
[1:20:10] how the name Christopher
[1:20:13] it means light bearer
[1:20:16] you're not sleeping
[1:20:18] Christopher it means light bearer
[1:20:21] Christ Bearer
[1:20:24] it's a beautiful thing brother
[1:20:27] getting into our scripture tonight I
[1:20:29] apologize for the
[1:20:30] I guess the long way home but
[1:20:33] verse 7 of First Peter chapter 3
[1:20:35] likewise he husbands dwelling with them
[1:20:37] according to knowledge
[1:20:39] knowledge
[1:20:41] strongs
[1:20:44] g5029 T May
[1:20:48] actually I got this wrong
[1:20:51] I apologize bear with me
[1:20:54] I just mixed them up
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] pause
[1:21:00] there we go
[1:21:01] G 1108 knowledge out of Strong's
[1:21:05] gnosis
[1:21:07] is knowing the ACT
[1:21:10] that is by implication knowledge
[1:21:13] knowledge science
[1:21:16] learning my words learning understanding
[1:21:20] being taught being willing
[1:21:23] to be taught understanding that there
[1:21:25] has to be an understanding
[1:21:28] knowledge is the act that is by
[1:21:30] implication knowledge
[1:21:32] you know the Amplified Bible this this
[1:21:34] verse here in the same way
[1:21:38] you married men should live
[1:21:40] considerately with your wives
[1:21:43] with an intelligent recognition of the
[1:21:47] marriage relation
[1:21:49] honoring the woman as physically the
[1:21:53] weaker
[1:21:54] but realizing that you are joint Heirs
[1:21:58] of the grace
[1:21:59] God's unmerited favor of life
[1:22:02] in order that your prayers may not be
[1:22:06] hindered and cut off
[1:22:08] otherwise you cannot pray effectively
[1:22:10] this is out of the Amplified Bible
[1:22:15] but getting back to what I wanted to
[1:22:16] talk about here likewise he husbands
[1:22:19] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:22:20] understanding that we need to be taught
[1:22:22] there needs to be an instruction about
[1:22:24] this it's not just something that we're
[1:22:26] making up here and I'll tell you why I'm
[1:22:28] going this way with it the reason I'm
[1:22:30] going this way you probably wondering
[1:22:31] brother Barry why are you talking about
[1:22:32] this so much simply because I feel
[1:22:34] challenged about it I feel like maybe
[1:22:36] I'm going a long ways the wrong way but
[1:22:38] I I don't think so I truly believe that
[1:22:41] we need to be instructed we need to have
[1:22:43] instruction the word of God here says
[1:22:46] not here but in in Titus Chapter 2 that
[1:22:49] the Elder women need to instruct the
[1:22:52] younger women and we know that that's
[1:22:54] actually happening and it's such a a
[1:22:56] wonderful thing because it's a
[1:22:57] scriptural thing it's not a berry thing
[1:23:00] it's not a Calgary Living Word thing
[1:23:01] it's it's according to the word of God
[1:23:03] it's instructing we need to do it with
[1:23:05] our children parents need to instruct
[1:23:08] our children parents if we don't
[1:23:09] instruct our children someone will
[1:23:12] someone will if we don't teach our
[1:23:15] children about drugs someone's going to
[1:23:17] teach them about drugs
[1:23:19] is it going to be the right person
[1:23:23] we need to make sure that we're giving
[1:23:24] them the instruction
[1:23:26] the same thing can be said for alcohol
[1:23:28] same thing could be said for many
[1:23:30] different things but as parents it's our
[1:23:32] responsibility it's our duty to make
[1:23:34] sure that we teach that we instruct the
[1:23:38] word of God says train them up in the
[1:23:41] way they would go how do you do that you
[1:23:43] have to teach them train them up in the
[1:23:45] way they would go I'm sorry I'm not
[1:23:47] trying to get on a soapbox here and say
[1:23:50] that I think I'm doing something right
[1:23:52] even though I feel challenged I just I
[1:23:54] know that Satan doesn't like it I know
[1:23:56] that Satan doesn't want families to be
[1:23:58] healthy Satan doesn't want parents
[1:24:00] instructing Satan doesn't want husbands
[1:24:02] living according to the word of God he
[1:24:04] doesn't want wives obeying their
[1:24:05] husbands he doesn't want husbands loving
[1:24:07] their wives Satan doesn't want no part
[1:24:09] of that he wants children to disobey
[1:24:11] their parents
[1:24:13] that's the age that we live in but you
[1:24:16] know this verse here likewise ye
[1:24:17] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:24:19] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[1:24:22] unto the weaker vessel
[1:24:24] I looked up that word honor
[1:24:26] g5092 that's what I I read earlier
[1:24:29] teammate is what that word is out of
[1:24:31] Strong's Concordance a value that is
[1:24:34] Money Paid or concretely and and
[1:24:36] collectively valuables maybe some folks
[1:24:40] pay a dowry for their wives so that
[1:24:42] would apply right there I believe
[1:24:44] but it goes on to say by analogy esteem
[1:24:47] especially of the highest degree brother
[1:24:50] Branham says that if God could give you
[1:24:52] anything better outside of Salvation
[1:24:54] than he would but he gives you your wife
[1:24:56] your wife is the greatest thing outside
[1:24:59] of your salvation even above healing
[1:25:01] Brothers even above healing the greatest
[1:25:04] thing that we could be given is a wife
[1:25:06] outside of our salvation by God an
[1:25:09] analogy by analogy esteem especially of
[1:25:12] the highest degree or the dignity itself
[1:25:17] honor precious
[1:25:19] price some
[1:25:21] I don't understand some of the words but
[1:25:23] I just think it kind of gets the point
[1:25:25] across there that the the wife is the
[1:25:27] most valuable thing the esteemed to be
[1:25:31] the highest outside of the word of God
[1:25:33] in our homes and we know that Satan has
[1:25:36] taken it and completely flipped it
[1:25:38] upside down the the order of operations
[1:25:41] the way that things should go what Satan
[1:25:43] has done in this world is he has taken
[1:25:45] the father and made him to look like a
[1:25:46] fool
[1:25:47] and and put him at the bottom of the
[1:25:49] totem pole and below the father is
[1:25:52] Christ to look even more foolish like a
[1:25:55] fable there's children that have no idea
[1:25:57] today who Jesus is no different than the
[1:25:59] Easter Bunny or Santa Claus it's just
[1:26:02] some other Fable some other thing that's
[1:26:04] happening in the world they don't even
[1:26:06] understand what Easter truly means what
[1:26:08] we're heading into but you know brothers
[1:26:10] and sisters there's a group of people
[1:26:12] that do understand it they recognize it
[1:26:14] it's become more Vivid now than it ever
[1:26:17] has been what that bumper of blood truly
[1:26:19] means to the believer that those people
[1:26:21] who are willing not just willing but
[1:26:23] able to believe on his name to believe
[1:26:26] on the word of Jesus Christ to them they
[1:26:30] have been given the ability to become
[1:26:32] the sons of God that is unbelievable
[1:26:35] it's incredible because now we can take
[1:26:38] this brothers and sisters like we always
[1:26:40] do when we get into these discussions
[1:26:42] and look at it from the perspective of
[1:26:44] the Lord likewise ye husband the Lord
[1:26:47] well with them according to knowledge
[1:26:50] giving honor unto the wife the Bride As
[1:26:53] the weaker vessel giving honor unto her
[1:26:55] to recognize that according to this
[1:26:58] instruction to this knowledge you are
[1:27:00] The Virtuous sinless spotless Bride of
[1:27:02] the Jesus Christ that that that you
[1:27:04] never did it in the first place it's not
[1:27:06] as though you never did it you actually
[1:27:07] never did it when you have the ability
[1:27:09] to receive the word of God for your day
[1:27:11] because when you receive the word of God
[1:27:13] for your day you're not just receiving a
[1:27:15] a book that says voice of God Recordings
[1:27:18] you're not just getting an app on your
[1:27:20] phone and saying I believe that God sent
[1:27:22] a prophet what you're doing is actually
[1:27:24] getting the holy ghost in your life
[1:27:25] that's what it is when you're receiving
[1:27:27] the word of God you could pick up the
[1:27:29] Bible and say well I received the word
[1:27:31] of God but remember the eunuch he
[1:27:33] received the word of God in his day he
[1:27:35] was reading it and trying to understand
[1:27:37] it how could I understand this word of
[1:27:39] God but remember God sent a prophet he
[1:27:42] picked him up and time traveled him and
[1:27:44] said you need to go over here and he
[1:27:46] left what he was doing going to go and
[1:27:48] Minister the word of God and we know
[1:27:50] that he said hey I receive this in its
[1:27:52] fullness what forbids us hey there's
[1:27:54] some water right over there why don't we
[1:27:55] just go and get baptized why don't we
[1:27:57] just get her done according to the word
[1:27:58] of God the outward expression of the
[1:28:01] inward work and what happened we know
[1:28:03] that he received the word for his day
[1:28:05] and that's when he was translated our
[1:28:07] brother he went right back to work again
[1:28:09] to the other side of the country
[1:28:12] but you know when we look at this
[1:28:14] scripture here likewise ye husbands
[1:28:16] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:28:17] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[1:28:20] weaker vessel giving honor unto her
[1:28:22] recognizing that you she's esteemed
[1:28:25] above everything else think about the
[1:28:27] way our lord Jesus thinks about us
[1:28:29] brothers and sisters your esteemed
[1:28:31] tonight above everything else there's
[1:28:33] all kinds of different things that he's
[1:28:35] got on his mind right now at this very
[1:28:37] moment even but you know what brothers
[1:28:39] and sisters he's right here in our midst
[1:28:41] and he's thinking about you he's
[1:28:43] thinking about your need and he knows
[1:28:45] what's on your heart he knows what's in
[1:28:47] your thoughts he knows what's in your
[1:28:49] mind and if you have a need you can make
[1:28:51] it known unto him you can speak it in
[1:28:54] your heart to him
[1:28:56] I just think it's so beautiful when we
[1:28:58] recognize it because it is exactly the
[1:29:00] way he wants it to be he wants to be a
[1:29:02] husband
[1:29:03] he wants to be a father
[1:29:06] he wants to have a bride of his own
[1:29:08] choosing that's one of the threefold
[1:29:10] purpose of of the whole entire Plan of
[1:29:14] Redemption I'll call the musicians
[1:29:15] tonight so I don't keep us here but you
[1:29:17] know we're looking at ourselves tonight
[1:29:19] as the Bride of Jesus Christ shifting
[1:29:23] from bride position to wife position
[1:29:26] with our husband and as we do that
[1:29:28] brothers and sisters when you speak it's
[1:29:32] not you speaking when we speak it's not
[1:29:34] us speaking it's truly the Lord Jesus
[1:29:36] Christ speaking himself his word through
[1:29:40] us
[1:29:42] I just think this Amplified Bible I'm
[1:29:44] going to read it again here as we stand
[1:29:46] tonight and uh and we'll close but out
[1:29:50] of the Amplified Bible this verse 7 out
[1:29:52] of First Peter chapter 3 in the same way
[1:29:55] you married men should live
[1:29:57] considerately
[1:29:59] with your wives
[1:30:01] with an intelligent recognition
[1:30:04] of the marriage relation an intelligent
[1:30:08] recognition and understanding a
[1:30:11] comprehension of the magnitude of the
[1:30:13] position that we're in as husbands and I
[1:30:16] would say of the magnitude of position
[1:30:18] that he is in as our husband
[1:30:26] it's a beautiful thing brothers and
[1:30:28] sisters with an intelligent recognition
[1:30:30] of the marriage relation honoring the
[1:30:33] woman
[1:30:34] as physically the weaker but realizing
[1:30:38] that you are joint Heirs of the grace of
[1:30:42] God's unmerited favor
[1:30:44] and we know that brother Branham taught
[1:30:46] it very clearly that his unmerited favor
[1:30:48] is Grace
[1:30:50] his grace unmerited favor are our
[1:30:54] wedding band of unmerited Grace that
[1:30:58] truly you are the sinless Spotless
[1:31:00] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and we
[1:31:03] will never ever be able to give
[1:31:06] ourselves over to fables we'll never be
[1:31:08] able to give ourselves over to anything
[1:31:09] other than the pure
