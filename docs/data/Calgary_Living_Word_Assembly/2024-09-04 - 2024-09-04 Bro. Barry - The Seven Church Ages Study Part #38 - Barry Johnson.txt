richly bless you if you have your Bibles we'll continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages we'll read out of Revelations chapter 2 talking about the pergami and church age starting with verse 12 of Revelations chapter 2 and to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in an toass was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for the ear to hear what your spirit saith unto the church today Father we thank you for the revelation of these Church ages Lord the unveiling of them Father the explanation to us Lord that we're not just left in the dark presuming father we pray that you would just Quicken this word to us again fresh once once again tonight Lord Jesus as we walk with you in the cool of the evening we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a little bit of announcements we have a prayer meeting tomorrow night we're certainly uh excited for that that we have brother toes OD denoo he'll be taking the service on Sunday and uh we're excited about that as well and uh I'm exceptionally excited to hear what the Lord's placed on his heart as he has requested that we study ahead in the message how can I overcome as I posted in the WhatsApp chat group I had ministered from that a while back and uh there's just so many nuggets in that message that are are so pertinent to us in our day because I believe every one of us wants to know how to overcome we're excited about Sunday pray for brother toes and uh I'm sure the Lord will bless us we have the youth service coming up on the 15th after service we'll have that at our place um on behalf of brother Joel and Sister Crystal who are not able to take it this month we also have a communion service coming up on the 22nd and I do apologize I Mis announced that before but we had agreed to do the services at 5:30 instead of 6:00 p.m. so that we have time to actually do everything and uh not feel pressured but we can get home at a decent time I know it's a very difficult time this month uh with all the children going back to school everything in our lives is changing and it takes a little while to get used to the routine so um we're going to have that service at 5:30 p.m. and we'll trust the Lord will bless it are you happy this evening certainly a wonderful song service when the atmosphere gets set like that it's just a a wonderful thing last week we read we read from the scripture um we read we read out of the church age book rather the scripture verse 15 out of Revelations chapter 2 and tonight uh we'll go uh dive into to the doctrine of balum verse 15 talks about the doctrine of the niaes and uh verse 14 actually is about the doctrine of balum and I think it's interesting we pointed out last week how those two are actually reversed in the church age book compared to the way they are in the scripture and I believe it's for a purpose brother brandham is pointing out the doctrine of the nicotin is the the lordship over man man over man the the Bishops that were set up and created which is exactly against the word of God and how men can actually decide who should be doing what according to the will of God and uh it's just a beautiful thing to see how the prophet brought that out but I think there's something really fascinating and uh I pointed it out last week as well I believe the Lord showed us that and that is that you cannot have the spirit of nanism without having the spirit of balum the doctrine of balum being there as well and the doctrine of balum we heard about that the doctrine of balum is uh the doctrine that teaches people to cast stumbling blocks before other people now some would say the scripture says that was to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel but we know that's applicable in our day as well and uh it's a very important thing I'm just going to start with the beginning here of the doctrine of balum out of the uh exposition of the seven Church ages Revelations 2:14 brother Bram uh sorry the scripture says Thou Hast them there that hold the doctrine of balum who taught balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication Lord willing will get a good portion of this the way through this um it's it's very rich paragraph 194 brother banam says now you just can't have a nickan setup in the church and not have this other Doctrine come into you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and a substitute spells bism and brother Brown I he goes on to say it here but I'm just going to throw it out there just because I think it's really important to sort of highlight and underline these things and and what the spirit of bmismart any sort of hybrid and I want to say any sort of tradition any sort of way that we want to worship God that's different than the message of the hour I'm going to say it tonight it's bism and we need to call it what it is the devil wants us to dance around it and say well you know that's just their tradition and that's just their way and we've always done it this way and we don't want to offend anyone but you know what the word of God is quick and Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it needs to do what it needs to do it's given to us to perfect us and it takes a five-fold Ministry to bring that Perfection but we don't want to make any excuses for the doctrine of balum we don't want to make any excuses for a nician Doctrine either he goes on to say if we're going to understand what the doctrine of balum is in the New Testament Church we had better go back and see what it was in the Old Testament Church and apply it to that third age and then bring it up to the present I've got that highlighted here bring it up to the present I love how he does that he doesn't just keep it back there in history it's not just in the Old Testament it's not just in the New Testament it's in this Testament it's in the present Testament paragraph 196 oh sorry the story is found in Numbers chapter 22 through 2 uh there's a lot of reading in there I thought maybe we should dive into it maybe we will sometime get into preaching about it but if you want to see it it's in numbers CH 22 through to 2 well worth the read if you're interested in what the doctrine of balum is um brother bam goes on to say now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God they were the Pentecostals of their day they had signs and wonders right they had taken Refuge under the blood they had all been baptized in the Red Sea and they had come up out of the waters singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophetes played her tambourine well after a certain time of journeying these children of Israel came to Moab you remember who Moab was he was the son of lot by one of his own daughters and lot in turn was a nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab were related I want you to see that he says who wants you to see that the prophet brother Vil of the Holy Ghost who wants you to see that the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not they were related so Israel came up to the borders of Moab and sent Messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if your people if our people or animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for it but King balac got very excited I love it why did he get excited because he was an insecure King he knew what was right but he wasn't doing it the head of that nickan Bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky why was it risky why would that be risky why would it be risky for God to shine in people's face as he might lose some of his crowd some people might actually get attracted to that some people might actually get the Holy Ghost and want to go forwards with that so BAC refused to let Israel pass through because he was an insecure King he knew he was doing wrong in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to a hling prophet called balum and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition the almighty to curse Israel and to render them impotent can you imagine that there's no different today brothers and sisters remember he said he wanted to bring it up to the present there no different today the spirits still do this exact same thing try to get people rendered impotent and what that means it's not so they can't have children it's not so they can't actually live their lives and be functioning normal citizens in this world it's so they don't see the power of God it's so that that spirit can creep into the framework of the Christian Church get into people's lives and and show them the way to go but give them the opportunity to to maybe step aside and say well I just want to do it my way the word of God will never give us the ability to compromise but the devil will come in and try and get God's people to be rendered impotent to be powerless anyways paragraph 199 and balum being eager to take part in the political Affairs and become a great man was only too glad to do so but seeing that he had to approach and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed as he could not do it by himself he went to ask God if he could have his permission to go just it's it's hard to even comprehend this really now isn't that just like the nicians huh the nicians we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way you ever heard of that you ever heard of anybody in the message say that if you don't do it my way you're going to hell anybody that's a spirit that we're talking about here and it's alive and well and it is not afraid to jump into the message groups and tell people if you don't do it my way then you're not going to be saved nickan Spirit the doctrine of the nicians when balum asked God for permission to go God turned him down my that's stung so Bayo is insisted promising him even greater rewards and honor so balam went back to God now one answer from God should have been enough not for self-willed balum when God saw his perversity he told them to get up and go you're GNA do it anyway go for it quickly he saddled the donkey and away he went he should have realized that this was simply God's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to curse them if he went 20 times and tried 20 times he was a prophet should he not know how like balum are people today oh I want to do this and I believe that God will bless me when I do it he might but it doesn't mean he say will just because we get a blessing in our life doesn't mean it's God's will no it's got to be according to the word how like balam are people today they believe in three gods and get baptized in three titles instead of the name and yet God will send the spirit upon them as he did upon balum and they will go on believing that they are exactly right and here they are actually perfect bites see the doctrine of balum go ahead anyway do it your way they said well God has blessed us it must be all right I know he's blessed you I don't deny that but it's the same organizational route that balum took its Defiance to God's word its false teaching now I want to say here tonight we can say while brother Barry he's just talking about the trinitarian doctrine and he is we know that very clearly but with the spirit of God we can read between the lines and say that and anything else but what the word of God for our day says is exactly the same thing because we can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and still get into the permissive will of God and still be blessed and still think that everything is okay but God won't leave us there he'll even let a donkey squish our leg up against the wall to get our attention and if that don't get our attention then he'll even let the donkey tell us what's your problem man there's something wrong with you don't you see the angel of the Lord is standing in front of you with his sword drawn to kill you my so balum went wildly down the road until an angel from God stood in his way but that Prophet Bishop Cardinal chairman president and general overseer was so blinded to the spiritual things by the thought of honor and glory and money that he could not see the angel stand ING with a drawn sword there he stood to block the Mad Prophet the little donkey saw him and dodged back and forth until he finally crushed balam's foot against the stone wall the ass stopped and would not go on he could not so balum jumped off and began beating him isn't that just the way we are as humans we become mad sometimes I've been there you have been there you ever experienced it you're just beating your head against the wall thinking you everything is right and it's wrong and the wronger it gets the harder you push balum jumped off and began beating him the donkey then began to talk to Bam God let that donkey speak in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid he was the original seed he said to the blinded Prophet am I not your donkey and haven't I carried you Faithfully bam replied yes yes you are my donkey and you have carried me Faithfully until now talking to a donkey and if I can't get you going I'm going to kill you whoa what's this talking to a donkey that's funny I thought I heard the donkey talking and I was answering it back God has always spoken in a tongue he spoke at belshazzar's feast and then at Pentecost he's doing it again today it's a warning of soon coming judgment then the angel was made visible to balum he told balum that except for the Donkey he'd be dead even now for tempting God but when balam promised to go back he was sent on with the admonition to say only what God gave him and I can only imagine that guy he wanted to say everything that God said he wasn't interested in trying to make excuses for nobody not at that point but he had a little bit of a different walk didn't he his foot was hurt so balum went down and set up seven altars for the clean Beast of sacrifice he killed a ram signifying the coming of the Messiah he knew what to do to approach unto God he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics same as now can't you see it nicolaes there was Israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same things but only one had the signs following only one had God in their midst four form won't get you anywhere it can't take the place of spirit manifestation sometimes we can do that it's very important to not not worry so much about Forum brothers and sisters worry about the Dynamics worry about the Holy Spirit brother Ram says that is what happened at NAA they put over balam's Doctrine not the doctrine of God and they stumbled y they fell they became dead men these are hard words after the sacrifice was made balum was ready to prophesy but God tied his tongue up and he could not curse them he blessed them Balo was very angry but there was nothing Bam could do about the prophecy it had been spoken by the Holy Ghost so baac took balum to go down into the valley and look upon their back parts to see if there wasn't possibly some way that he could curse them the tactics that BAC used are the same tactics they use today who uses today who's they the big denominations look down at the little groups and anything they find amongst them to make out a scandal they bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin no one says anything about it but let one of the elect get into trouble and every paper blasted across the country yes Israel had her back carnal Parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of God that works through election by grace and not by works by grace and not by works they had the cloud by day and the Pillar of Fire by night they had the smitten Rock the Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders they were Vindicated not in themselves but in God Amen God didn't have any respect for those nicians with their phds llds and DDS and all their fine organizations and the best that man could boast but he did have respect unto Israel for they had the word Vindicated amongst them certainly Israel didn't look too polished up just having come out of Egypt in Precious flight but she was blessed people anyway all she had ever known for over 300 years was hurting flocks tending fields and slaving away in fear of death under the Egyptians but she was free now she was a blessed people through the sovereignty of God certainly Moab looked down on her all the other nations did too isn't that interesting that Moab looked down on here we got the prophet saying that Moab looked down on her without recognizing the roots of where Moab came from goodness sakes organization always looks down on the unorganized and either will by determination bring them into organization or destroy them when they won't come if you're not seeing it my way then you're not seeing it at all and it goes further than that we know that that's just the beginning of it we read all about it last night or the sorry last service the spirit of the nicians they'll think they're God doing God a service by actually killing people in the name of the Lord which is just shocking but it's coming again paragraph 2113 now someone might ask me brother br what makes you think that Moab was organized while Israel was not where did you get that idea I get it right here in the Bible as usual so beautiful isn't it I don't get it from some textbook somewhere else from some theology from some Seminary I I get it I get it right here in the Bible it's all typed out here everything written in the Old Testament that is in the story form is written for our admonition so that we can learn from it here it is right in numbers 23:9 from the top of the Rocks I see him and from the hills I Behold Him Lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the Nations he says There It Is God looking down from the top of the Rocks not in some Valley looking for their bad points and condemning them God seeing them the way he wanted to see them from the height of love and mercy while I was studying this I just had to highlight that and underline that and and note that brothers and sisters let us look upon one another from the height of love and mercy not look down on one another not look at at hinder Parts not not try and find fault and failure in one another let's look at one another from the height of love and mercy it's just so wonderful God looks at them the way that he wanted them to be the way that he created them to be and we know that he does that with us also they dwelt alone and they weren't organized they didn't have a king they had a prophet and the prophet had God in him by the spirit and the word came to the prophet and the word went to the people they didn't belong to the UN they didn't Belong To The World Council of churches to the Baptist Presbyterians Assembly of God or any other group they didn't need to belong isn't that wonderful to think that they didn't need to belong we don't need to belong here tonight either they didn't need to belong they were joined to God they didn't need counsel from any councel they had thus saith the Lord in their midst Hallelujah and we already covered that and pick up your pen and WR but I just have to say it she has the mind of the Lord she already has thus sayith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with it so we have thus sayith the Lord in our midst Hallelujah now in spite of the fact that balum knew the proper approach to God and can bring forth a revelation from the Lord by means of a special enduement of power he was still for all of that Bishop in the false group for what he did now in order to win the favor what did for what did he do now in order to win favor with BAC he formulated a plan wherein God would be forced to deal with Israel in death just as Satan knew that he could beguile Eve because just as s sorry just as Satan knew that he could beguile Eve caused her to fall all in fleshly sin thus causing God to pass his pronounced sentence of death against sin so balum knew that if he could get Israel to sin God would have to deal with them in death isn't that shocking to think about that another human being would actually be operating on the same level the serpent was under the same exact anointing to manipulate God so he planned a way to get them to come over and join in sin he sent out invitations to come to the Feast of Bal peor come over and worship with us now Israel no doubt had seen Feast of the Egyptians so they did not feel it was too wrong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people what could be wrong with it you're just fellowshipping with them right what's wrong with Fellowship anyway we're supposed to love them aren't we or how can we win them being friendly never heard anyone or so they thought but when those sexy motish women began to dance and undress while they Whirled around doing their rock and roll and twist the lust rose up in the Israelites and they were drawn into adultery and God in Wrath slw 42,000 of them it's just got me thinking while I was studying this you know how God created man and woman and how he separated the two and how there was the fall we all know about this men are wired a certain way and when they see a woman dressed a certain way it causes a reaction whether the man wants it or not it causes a reaction because we are in this flesh this is the DNA that we have when we talk about spiritual DNA it is a spiritual thing flesh has to perish but this flesh always gets a reaction that's why it's vital to follow the instructions of the Vindicated Prophet for the woman to recognize to not wear clothing pertaining to a man garments that pertain to a man to not wear clothing that makes a woman look like a skin down weener exact quote of the Prophet because when that happens if a man looks upon the woman what happens is there's a reaction now a Son of God is going to take that reaction and say I understand what's happening and push it aside and fight it but he has to fight it it's not something that just automatically happens and there's no no issue no problem and we know the world is set up today I've heard it even to say that it's the man's problem if the man looks it's his fault that's not the way that God created it that's not the way it works God created man to look upon a woman and to love her because she is is actually a part of him I'm going off on a tangent and I don't want to do that tonight but remember the way that baac got balam to curse them was to look upon the women and to lust after them and to fall in adultery to fall in fornication and God slew 42,000 of them and that is what Constantine and his successors did at NAA and after NAA they invited the people of God to the con vention and when the church sat down to eat and Rose up to play partaking of church form ceremonies and Pagan feasts named after Christian rights she was trapped she had committed fornication and God walked out my and when man turns from the word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he is don't join a church don't join into organization and get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from God and and how does this apply in our day brothers and sisters it applies by us interpreting this message of the hour and putting our own spin on it taking it and making it fit our lives and say we can just do it this way we can worship God this way remember we said at the start of this the doctrine of balum is to actually make a substitute for this word of God any substitute is the doctrine of balum that is what's happened in every age since he says God delivers the people they come out by the blood Sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit but after a while the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back into the second generation and sometimes even before then he's talking about the second generation of people parents children grandchildren parents first generation children second generation second generation getting away from the word of God they no longer have the spirit of God just a form of worship we just go to church we just go to church we just sing songs we play music we just worship that's not what it's about at all it's about recognizing when we gather together this way we're meeting the King of Kings the Lord of lords and I I said it before I thought it was so beautiful the Lord I believe just gave it to me we're practicing the biggest special of our lives every time we have the opportunity to sing because we're coming to a place when we step over there that's all we're going to do is worship we're not preaching we're not reading the word we're not going to be reading the message of the hour we're going to be praising God right I just think this is shocking in here though in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organized themselves right back in the second generation and sometimes even before then they no longer have the spirit of God just a form of worship bism they are dead they have hybridized themselves with a Creed and form and there is no life in them remember brother brandham says that if your worship if your religion doesn't have emotion it's dead and you might as well bury it and get something else get one with life so balum got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I have this highlighted here he says it again just like Paul said right just like Paul repeated himself if an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel than that which has already been preached let him be accursed again I say unto you he says it twice here we have brother Bram saying do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I said the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the Lake of Fire that is what God thinks of organization yes sir the wh and her daughters will be in the Lake of Fire strong words we would never wish that upon anyone even our worst enemies this is the spirit of God Discerning right from wrong denomination are not of God they never have been and never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into a hierarch hierarchy and Ley and it is therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people that's what organization and denominations do in organizing they separate themselves from the word of God and bring themselves into spiritual adultery my now notice that Constantine gave special feasts unto the people they were the old Pagan feasts with the new names taken from the church or in some cases Christian rights were taken and abused with Pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the son God and changed it to the Son of God instead of celebrating on December 21st which is the winter solstice which is when they used to celebrate the feast to the son God they put it up to December 25th and called it the son of God's birthday but we know that he was born in April when life comes forth not in December and they took the feast to aarte and called it the Easter celebration where in the Christian is supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection of the Lord actually it was a pagan Feast to aarte and we know that both of them now are just commercial times in the world they placed altars in the church they put images they put in images they gave the people what they call the Apostles Creed though you can't find it in the Bible they taught the people ancestor worship thereby making the Roman Catholic Church the greatest spiritistic Church in the world every foul bird was in that cage and you have the Protestants with their organizations doing the same thing they ate things sacrificed to Idols now I don't say this really means they were literally eating Meats sacrificed to Idols for though the Council of Jerusalem had spoken against such Paul did not make much of it as he said the idols were nothing it was just a matter of conscience and except where it offended the weaker brother and then it was not allowed furthermore this Revelation has to do with Gentiles and not Jews as these are Gentile churches I see this in the same light as I see the words of the Lord except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God you can see that eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense so when these people were bowing to the images lighting candles using pagan holidays confessing their sins to men all of which belongs to the devil's religion that is strong they were partakers with the devil and not of the Lord they were in idolatry whether they admitted it or not they can talk all they want that the altars and the incense are only to remind them of the prayers of the Lord or whatever they think it means and they can say that when they pray before the image it is just for the sake of emphasis and that when they confess it to the priest it is really to God they are doing it in their hearts and when they say the priest forgives them it is just that he is doing it in the name of the Lord they can say what they want but they are partaking in the well-known Babylonian satanic religion and have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication which means death they are dead that's really hard because we know people we all know people that's what the prophet said it's what God Said through the prophet paragraph 226 so the church and the state were married the church joined up with Idols with the power of the state behind them they felt that now the kingdom of God had come and God's will had been enforced upon the Earth no wonder the Roman Catholic Church is not looking for the return of the Lord Jesus they not millennialist they have their Millennium right here the pope is reigning right now and God is reigning in him this is really harsh but it's true so when he comes according to them it has to be when the new heavens and the new Earth are prepared but they are wrong that Pope is the head of the false church and they are going to be huh and there there is going to be a millennium but while that is going on he won't be in it he will be somewhere else the warning repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth Revelations 2:16 what else can he say can God overlook the sin of those who have borne his name in vain there is only one way to receive Grace in The Hour of sin repent confess you are wrong come to God for forgiveness and for the spirit of God this is a command from God to disobey his death for he says I will make war with you with the sword of my mouth the Beast made war with the Saints but God will make war with the Beast those who fought the word will will one day find the word fighting them and that's even true today there's people that fight this word this message of the hour it is a serious thing to take from or add to the word of God for those who changed it and did with it as it suited them what will their end be but death and destruction but still the grace of God Cries Out repent aren't you thankful for the grace of God tonight oh how sweet are the thoughts of repentance nothing in my hands I bring simply to thy cross I cling I bring my sorrow I Repent that I am what I am and what I have done now it is the blood nothing but the blood of Jesus what will it be repentance or by the sword of death it's up to you my I'll call the musicians tonight I don't want to keep us late I know we're uh we're changing gears with our lives as we begin the school year I could go on but I just think it'd be better to maybe sing a few songs before we dismiss I just think it's fascinating this uh this word the exposition of the seven Church ages I've been so thrilled with it the Lord's just so wonderful and I know there's probably many different ways we can study it and uh probably different times we will but we we know that this is a summary of the message of the hour right here in this book maybe stand with me as we close tonight you can't have the doctrine of the nicians and not see the doctrine of bmismart and we're so thankful that you sent us a prophet Lord Jesus and we don't say that the prophet's word is your word what we do say is that that Prophet quoted your word and that Prophet points back to your word and that Prophet tied up all the loose ends in your word and all of the answers to those questions are found in your word they're not they're not from an outside Source they don't come from afar they're not some man's teaching they're your teaching Lord you the spirit of Truth and and we know that's the reason why the world rages against being baptized in your name because if someone can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins they can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and when that Spirit comes in that Spirit your spirit your very life will lead us and guide us into all truth according to your word but the devil hates that thought because because once somebody is released from the bonds of Sin from a religious spirit we know the devil can't touch him so father tonight we pray that Lord we could just live our lives from the height of Grace and of love as we read about tonight Lord Jesus the way that you look upon us father help us to look upon one another help us to look upon ourselves Lord Jesus and father let it be repentance in our hearts Lord not the sword don't let us fall on the sword Lord Jesus but let us repent unto you we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands For Your Glory now as we go our separate ways we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen sing sing this song I hear the Savior say th my strength indeed is small we watch and pray find in me thine all and all he paid it all Jesus Paid It all all to him my own sin has left a Crimson Stain he washes white
