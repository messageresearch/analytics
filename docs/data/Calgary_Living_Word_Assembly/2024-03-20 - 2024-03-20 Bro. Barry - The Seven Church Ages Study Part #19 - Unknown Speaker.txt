the body if you'll turn to Revelations chapter 2 we'll continue on with our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages talking about the seven Church ages that are mentioned in the Book of Revelation we're on the first church age which is the Ephesian church amen we'll just read the first seven verses of Revelations chapter 2 I know it can seem to get a little bit old when it's repetitive like this but it's just important amen there's so much in here so that's right Revelations 2:1 says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how th cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and H has borne and has has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nictitans which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we just desire to eat of that tree that's in the paradise of god father tonight we pray that you would just break the the bread of life unto us once again as we go forwards father we'll just Commit This service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we'll just be carrying on in the exposition of the seven Church ages before we do just a a few announcements we uh have the ladies brunch coming up I believe it's this Saturday we have Brother David Dean Hart he will be here for the Easter services Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning and uh I spoke to him today and he said to greet the Saints he's very excited about coming up from Idaho he lives in Napa Idaho and his Pastor um oh my goodness I'm joh like now he lives in uh NAA Idaho anyways and goes to church there uh brother Nester espinola from Philippines will be here April the 20th and 21st that'll be uh Saturday night and Sunday morning and then Sunday June the 2nd we have brother Dela adadon ad Delan he's a pastor from Nigeria who's been here I unfort fortunately don't recall but I know that he's been here a few times in the past I understand and uh he will be here on Sunday June the second as well we have uh just a little announcement we we've got a Bible study group wanting to start up and uh brother brother Don and brother Casey brother Paul have desired to do a Bible study for those people who are interested it will take place in the basement of the church every second Friday um from 7:00 onwards 7 till 8: or 9 I don't think they want to make it too long but just for a bit of Fellowship around the word and uh it will happen every two weeks it's something new and we're just going to start it up and try it out and for those people that want to attend Christian Fellowship then you're more than welcome to attend and if you don't want to then that's all right as well it's just going to be to meet together and discuss personal highlights of a message uh they want to set it up in such a way that the group takes two weeks to read a selected message and then meet to discuss the Revelation and personal highlights of that message I think it can be uh a really wonderful thing just to see what the mind of the Lord is through many different people I am a part of a morning Bible study where that happens I'm not on it every day but um you get a lot of different perspectives when you get together and you start fellowshipping around the words so I guess they're aiming to start that April the 5th and uh if you have any questions or concerns by all means just reach out and uh we'll be certainly happy to talk to you about it I think there's also going to be a chat group for it um initially Brother Don said that he would I think plan to use the men's chat for it just to do updates and uh communication through it so uh I don't know if there will be a separate chat for it we'll just see how it progresses how it evolves and uh if it's blessing are you happy tonight amen certainly uh sure sign of spring here in these parts to see snow and uh I think it's not done we're supposed to see quite a bit of snow but who knows what could happen the Lord does he knows what's going to happen and uh we'll just leave it in his hands I believe tomorrow night also we had scheduled a prayer meeting here at the church so we will definitely uh be planning to go forwards with that unless we have Epic amounts of snow we certainly don't want to put people in Peril to come out to the church but we'll just see and uh we'll communicate if it does get too bad last week we talked about the Ephesian Church age and the complaint of God Revelations 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love and you know brother bradam he talks about how God has no grandchildren and you you know how it is there's no such thing as Apostolic succession we'll get into that a little further tonight but just because our parents are saved and and a part of the message of the hour Believers that doesn't mean that we are we all have to have an upper room experience we know brother brandham said very clearly that even Mary the mother of Jesus who has been exalted so greatly by the Catholic church and many others she herself had to go into that upper room and receive the Holy Ghost as well it's not uh something that just happens because you're associated with someone or you're associated with Jesus you have to get to know him personally you have to have a personal relationship with him and you know outside of getting the holy ghost in your life I don't think you really can have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ brother Bram says you're not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost amen you know uh brother Bram he talks about that on on the prior pages I don't really want to go too far back um but just to carry on paragraph 90 we left off right here um about just maybe paragraph 89 you know how they they would pray all night they took the street corners the the people in Ephesus and they weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings he says they had reality and that was a good perspective on the word they understood the word of God for their day and they weren't willing to take the nickan spirit they weren't interested in the leadership of men they were in the interested in leadership of the Holy Ghost in their lives paragraph 90 brother bradam he goes on to say but it wasn't too long of a time until they began to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is all is about all that is left I just think that's such an interesting paragraph because we know that we have seen it in uh churches and you know even around the message of the hour we have people that would take this paragraph to heart and you can see that if you were to use the word program then it would become a big deal if you say that we've got a Sunday school program in the church it can become a big deal because brother bradam he talks about the leadership of men man instead of the leadership of the Holy Ghost trading power for programs is what brother Bram says very specifically but when we talk about this paragraph here you know they got money enough to buy fine new churches and they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man it is very important for the church brothers and sisters to not try and make everything too organized by man we have got to have the Holy Spirit leadership in the church if we don't have the Holy Spirit leadership in the church then we might as well stay home we might as well stay home there's no point to come to church if we get so formal with our worship so formal with our preaching so formal with our Forum in the church what we do is we choke out the liberty of the Holy Ghost if we get too worried about what people are going to think if we're too worried about having everything perfect in the music if every note has to be exact if every song that's sung has to be specific you know what we do we just stop the Holy Ghost right there we ground the power of the spirit right there that's what that paragraph is talking about and it can be taken too far it can go so far the other way the pendulum swings both ways the devil loves that because if he can't get you too far on one side he'll just push you to the other side but the balance is right down the middle brothers and sisters we need to be able to Worship in spirit and in truth brother Bram in paragraph 91 he goes on to say a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God 1 John 53 for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and I love how brother Bram puts this in there he says his word that's his Commandments right you know we we've heard it said many times before you know want to know what the will of the Lord is what's his will for our life his will is his word keep his word amen that's what it is paragraph 92 one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it if they if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story how important is it for us to live this word brothers and sisters amen Our Lives tell another story if we don't live this word we have to have the fruit of the spirit in our lives brother Bram goes on to say I wonder if John didn't see see a lot of that before he died people saying they loved God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church something is happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so subtly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big you can't you can see it out there in the open it's under cover and they are bringing it by way of reason and humor understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late you know I just want to I just want to pause there and just sort of give another commentary on this how important it is for us to recognize that even though we're talking about the Ephesian Church age this is the study on the church ages the exposition of the seven Church ages we talked about where the church age the churches were in Asia Minor this this is the the message to that specific Church but here we are in the seventh Church Age and and we're in the culmination of every single Church age and this is not just exclusive to the Ephesian Church age there's a portion from every single Church age that is applicable to our age every single Church age carries forward and the warnings the information the the the patterns that are set out here are applicable in the oncoming ages from each prior age so this is not just exclusive to the Ephesian Church age brothers and sisters it's very applicable to us in our day one little deviation from the word is a step away from Christ we need to make sure that we know where we stand with this they can say they love God but their lives tell another story and you know this is it's just the way Satan does it it happens so subtly it happens so subtly you can't even see it brother Bram he says in paragraph 93 they haven't made a move so big you can see it out in the open it's under cover and they're bringing by way of reason and human understanding not the leadership of the Holy Ghost human understanding and will take it and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late paragraph 94 but as usual people don't heed God's warning I say Lord help us to heed his warning go back to our first love he said that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit so blessed that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on and we know that this happened in Asbury recently and it was news General news out there but it happens in churches did we sing the same song Oh that song that we sang last week man the spirit of God was so strong we want to sing that song again we want to we want to do what we did everything the way we did it because we want to capture that and make it our way so that we can have that Spirit happen no no where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and he's going to do what he's going to do how he's going to do it every single time the way he wants to do it we're not going to be able to wave our wand and say we're just going to call on the Holy Spirit you know what that is that's a Pentecostal denomination to say that you know what if the initial evidence is whatever you want could be speaking in tongues it could be discernment could be whatever you want we know the Pentecostals say that it's speaking in tongues but here this is what it is it's all about the word isn't it how can we protect this truth we have we don't have to protect the word of God not one bit the word of God will Pro God will protect his word the word of God is a sword it's sharper than any two-edged sword that any man could prepare th this this word of God doesn't need us to protect it but he says how can we protect the truth we have we have to see this revival goes on paragraph 95 I've got this underlined and balen brother Bram says that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your Creed of what you believe put it on a church manual and they do it they organize they add to the word and they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts but it's what God Said now you might be saying brother Barry we don't write all this down in a book and put it in a in a in a Creed but brothers and sisters I want to say do we actually not write it in a book but make it our way sometimes and say that unless we worship the way that I'm used to worshiping I'm I'm just not going to worship I'm just not even going to come to song service because it's not the way that I'm used to does that actually stop the spirit of God no way there's no amount of unbelief that will hinder the spirit of God moving not one amount but you know we can easily maybe it's not worship maybe it's the way the preacher is maybe it's the way the deacons are maybe it's the way the babies are in the church brothers and sisters if we don't have babies in the church then pretty soon we're not going to have a church the children are the youth babies are going to cry parents will take them out the spirit of God will go onen if we're focusing on the right things brothers and sisters they're not even going to bother us the warning of God Revelations 2:5 remember therefore whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent I just was in into this and and I just couldn't help but think you know that's exactly like a marriage exactly like a marriage alls we need to do is remember from where we have fallen sometimes in our marriage we can get so Jaded by life and and and hurts and and failures and and things and words that happen events in our lives but all we got to do is go back and repent just repent go back to our first love but if we don't what will happen he says I'll come unto thee and will remove that Candlestick out of his place except thou repent paragraph 96 God tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something sometimes like I said that happens in marriage we just forget we just forget he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality back to when they could say for me to live as Christ back to Purity when annias and saf were dealt with we remember that story right ananas and saf where they all lived together commonly the apostles did the Believers in their day and and what happened they said they would give their money they would sell all their goods and then give it to the church and we know many people have taken this and exploited it for their good but that's not what we're talking about I just want to try and highlight this story a little bit just to bring it to the top of our minds these were people that came and lied to the the apostles they said you know did you sell well they came and brought their money the husband and wife they sold their property and and the deal was that they were going to give everything they had and live in common in in a in a common commune is what I'm trying to say and uh a communal life and everyone was on board with it the Holy Spirit was in it but they came and and this husband and wife said we're going to hold back a little bit for ourselves we're just going to hold back a little bit for us you know they don't need to know everything we'll just keep it all just hush hush and and we'll give a good amount it'll be lots you know it'll be fine but what happened in the end the the the the the the point that I want to get to is they weren't lying to the apostles they were lying to the Holy Ghost and brothers and sisters if we're not careful we can be lying to a brother or a sister but are you really lying to a brother or a sister children are you really lying to just your parents when you lie we have to make sure that we understand we're dealing with the Holy Ghost here and and when we're dealing with the Holy Ghost here he knows our every thought our every move now I I'm not saying this to scare children to think they're going to drop dead but that's what happened to ananas and saf they lied to the Holy Ghost and the apostles said to them how you know how how do you think you could do this do you think this is really something to play with brothers and sisters this this church that we're a part of is not something to play with it's not just a traditional form of worship this is God almighty this is the Holy Ghost we're talking about the same God brother Bram is talking about of ananas and saf that same God is with us even in us and because these people died because they lied they died dropped dead from their lie because they weren't lying to just the apostles brother Ram he says here for me to live as Christ back to Purity when ananas and saf were dealt with you can imagine everyone in their hearts when they heard what happened in that story they were saying okay I Repent everything that I've got it's yours I have nothing in my heart it would be kind of like coming and standing before a prophet wouldn't it someone who could discern your very heart you would say I'm not going to have any reservations there's nothing going to be hidden in my life he says back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance and countenance those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God look at what you once were in your heart and mind and in your life and then go back to it and I I just want to say you know with that sentence right there it's the same thing in a marriage just look back to what you once were in your heart in your mind in your life amen and just go back to it just go back to it you don't have to stay in a a situation you don't have to stay in a state you can just go back to where you once loved one another paragraph 97 and what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come by God by way of repentance then the luk worm or backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance prove it by your life don't just say it if you you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness God will then take away its faithful messenger and its faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about Christianity but be bereft of it that's terrible paragraph 98 repent quickly don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not long until the city was in Ruins its glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass the land became a marsh inhabited by water foul the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalled village there was gone except for a few unbelievers in a qu sory there was not even one Christian left the lamp was rent from his place I just can't help but think that's a lot like a Christian life isn't it just walk away from the word walk away from church and see how quickly it becomes desolate how quickly that life starts to go down the drain all manner of evil can take place in that life paragraph 99 now it does not mean that she could not have her repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to God in sorrow and then God will restore amen the glory shall come again the seed of nanism Revelations 2:6 this is really what I wanted to focus on tonight the seed of niotis the deed s of the nians revelations 2:6 but this thou Hast that thou H hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate paragraph 100 now there are two thoughts on what the nicians were it's said by some that they were a group of apostates who had as their founder Nicholas of Antioch a proelite who became one of the seven deacons at Jerusalem they had Pagan feast and were most unchaste in their behavior they taught that in order to master sensuality one would have to know by experience the whole range of it at first naturally they gave way to such abandon that their degradation was complete thus they had applied to them the two old testament names that symbolized such extravagances again brother Bram takes it right back to the word balum and Jezebel since balam corrupted the people and thus conquered them it was said that Nicholas did likewise this group was supposedly forced out of Ephesus and found a place of establishment in pergamus but the problem about this belief is that it is not true that's a problem there is absolutely no history for it it is at best tradition to adopt such a view would make the church age of Ephesus absolutely historical with no bearing upon today that is not true for whatever starts in the early Church Must continue in every age until it is finally blessed and exalted by God or destroyed as an unclean thing in the Lake of Fire that's what I was talking about earlier every single Church age carries forward it carries forward paragraph 102 that is the tradition that is actually against scripture simply note that in Revelations 2:2 the Ephesian Church could not bear the evil ones thus they had to put them out or it would not make sense to say that they could not bear them it's just so logical isn't it if they did not put them out then they were bearing them now in verse six it says that they hated their deeds so this nickan group remained a part of the First Age doing their deeds the Deeds were hated but the people were not rendered impotent thus we see seeds in Ephesus that will continue and become a doctrine that will go right up to and into the Lake of Fire so this he's saying very clearly the nickan spirit will continue all the way until the end from the very first age through every single age right up to the very end the nickan spirit to conquer the leoty paragraph 103 what are these nians brother bradam says the word comes from two Greek words Nika which means to conquer and leas which means the leoty in plain fact somebody was doing something in that early church which was Conquering the leoty if the Le were being conquered then it must have been some Authority there doing it what was it that God hated that was happening in that church what was going on then and is now going on today is exactly what the word nickan means the people were being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of God now that sounds like it's absolutely Blasphemous right but it can be one word off which is absolutely contrary to the word of God Amen paragraph 105 now to get the real meaning of what we are about to go into I must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made up of these two trees which had their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the Ephesian Church it is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad the two Vines make the church they are like the wheat and tears growing up side by side but one is true the other is false now God will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived right amen that is pretty powerful right super humbling to think that isn't it only the elect will not be deceived amen hallelujah if we have the ability to understand and not be deceived then truly you are elect and that means that we never chose it he chose it and that is just unbelievable a paradox unbelievable but true Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it it were possible they shall deceive the very elect I just love that verse because it shows this isn't just William Mariam Bram talking about the elect only the elect won't be deceived this is going right back to the scripture once again right am there is a very elect according to the word of God paragraph 107 so way back there in the early church a very short period after Pentecost the false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we find these Deeds of the nicotin and that spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine until it is destroyed by God now have you got it all right now what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of God was revealed to us by having f from its origin which was Pentecost in plain English that means that this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit the control of the spirit this is why brother brandham talked about it just a bit earlier about the leadership of man if the leadership of man Creeps in and starts to lead then what happens is the Holy Ghost pulls back and that church is is no longer being led by the right Spirit paragraph 109 this is exactly what took place after Moses LED Israel out of Egypt the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire prophetic utterance Miracles and signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God selected and God ordained and God equipped and God sent men and the whole Camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost move isn't it interesting well I was studying this I just couldn't help but think you know when they had come out of Egypt come out of bondage all the way out they're out in the wilderness now they're free and and Moses he gets summoned by God to come up to mount Soni come to the top and we know that it was a a dreadful sight for him that even his knees quak he didn't want to go up there where the fire in the cloud was that was where the children of Israel said you know what no we don't want to hear God no more let us hear from Moses just talk to Moses tell him and then he'll tell us and we won't have to be afraid to die but isn't it interesting that when Moses went up what happened Moses he had a right-hand man he had a god-given man but he didn't have that prophetic leadership and 40 days after the prophet being away from him 40 days after not having that leadership what happened that whole Camp went crazy they went from from from worshiping God and celebrating the true signs and wonders of of Jehovah God the pillar of fire and the cloud the one that was leading them just directly right back to to to melting down gold and and making calves to worship debauchery the whole thing 40 days without a prophet goodness sakes brothers and sisters if we've got a prophetic utterance run to it don't ever St from that prophetic word my they rebelled and wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by now brother ban him fast forwards to Samuel they rebelled and they wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by they were looking around they wanted to be like the world we need a king too but they had the King of Kings but they needed a king they rebelled and set wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by then they wanted a king they wanted to be ex exactly like the world and went into complete apostasy and Oblivion that is exactly how the first church age started and it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people and we know that there's a complete blacking out in this age that we're living in except for a teeny little sliver of light in those very elected ones beautiful paragraph 110 see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds then it became a Doctrine then it became the standard it became the unbending way we can get so easily focused on our unbending ways can't we brothers and sisters we've got to have flexibility we got to be like those trees we've heard said those trees need to be able to blow in the storm and they'll Bend and they'll bow and they'll go back and forth we got to be willing to be that way too if we're not flexible in our lives we can have a problem I heard it said when we were in Saskatchewan and if you're not flexible if you're not willing to be flexible in your life with things that happen wherever you are what's going to happen you're going to get bent out of shape that's good you got to be flexible it finally took over and God was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good and you know I'm going to say it this way it probably looked so organized didn't it it was so orderly and clean and tidy it was it was looked so good it seemed so good seemed so sound then they caught a hold and like a python it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh that false Vine is subtle it's like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you brother bradam he uses that that comparison it's like a python if a python ever gets it a body around our neck we've got a big problem it doesn't even need to be around our neck it could be just around our chest and start squeezing and then we can't breathe anymore terrible paragraph 111 now I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men that I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word and I believe that is what this church here Calgary Living Word is built on brothers and sisters that is the church that I first attended and I could see it loud and clear from the first sermon that I went to I could see it very clearly it wasn't said exactly like this I don't think but I could tell that this was the spirit of God that was leading this church and we want to stay exactly like this but it is not the leadership of men that I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge amen but that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God yes amen for the word and the spirit are one amen the moment brother Barry gets off the word it's no longer the spirit of God brothers and sisters if anybody gets behind this sacred desk and preaches something other than what's already been preached let him be accursed Hebrews 137 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation paragraph 112 but we see what was happening back there that false Vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed governances we have to have things written down and sometimes like I said we don't even have to write it down we can just say this is the way we do it yeah does it contribute to the word of God it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it God's way they simply took Authority and vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people that just is so sad so sad you got to get to Christ brothers and sisters amen you've got to know him in a personal way yourselves if there's ever a man that says they're the one you know they're wrong it's just like saying they know when he's going to come it's contrary to the word then they went right back to the old aonic system they became what they became Antichrist for they disposed of his mediatorship and imposed their own God hated that the Ephesians hated that and any true True Believer will hate it too amen we would have to be Stone blind not to see the same thing at work All Through the Ages and right now it is the worst of all what it was was organization that separated the people God's people are supposed to be one by one Spirit they are all baptized into one body and everyone is to be moved upon by by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God so this is just regular text in this book here everyone is capitals I love the way it's written everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost I'm just going to dwell on that brothers and sisters it's not optional amen it's not one day maybe I'll just see if it's going to work maybe you know and if it doesn't it's okay I'll just carry on no you have to have the Holy Ghost or you are not very elect hallelujah it's that simple everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God Amen so to say that I don't like singing brothers and sisters if there's anybody that doesn't like singing that's what we're going to do in heaven why not practice now the word of God says to make a Joyful Noise amen does the prophet of God even said I hate it when someone turns blue holding a note so long like they're perfectly trained when we come to church we want to Worship in spirit and in truth am it's not about performing if it's about performing then you we've missed the Mark what's happening is that organization is creeping into our thinking if that's what's going on that's the Antichrist spirit is what he says in this book right here we need to make sure that that's not happening because it is like a python it will get itself wrapped around us and it will get tight and Tighter and Tighter and every time we breathe out it'll squeeze Tighter and pretty soon we won't be able to take another breath everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of God but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control and Bishops became archbishops and and with imposing titles they bypassed the word of God and taught their own doctrines I just I've heard people say that they're the bishop of Calgary I I don't know there's no Bishop in the word of God there's no Bishop in the truly elected there's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if we have a bishop it's the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters yes he says they got the people to obey them until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost these Deeds were beginning of apostolic succession from Apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to church members ship and as the means of Saving Grace the word was reduced to a Creed Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church amen now remember brother bradam is talking about this Antichrist spirit that would creep into the church and cause it to be local and formal and Powerless it would be able to be within the framework of the Christian church but we know the truly elected is able to discern that and withstand it but you know we're not talking about a a church that's somewhere out in a different continent somewhere in a different denomination those two Vines are intertwined brothers and sisters the Antichrist Spirit wants to get into Calgary Living Word and try and organize men the Antichrist Spirit wants to get into Calgary Living Word and try and mess with us but we need to stay with the word hallelujah yes the word was reduced to a Creed the Antichrist by his Spirit was predominating the church that's never going to happen here amen we we will not allow that to happen here paragraph 114 look at it today and if you read acts 2:4 the way some do you could read it this way now in the day of Pentecost was fully come there came this just makes me scratch my head there came a priest with a wafer and said stick out your tongue he laid the wafer upon it then he himself drank some wine and said you have now received the Holy Ghost man you'd have to call an Uber if you had a communion service afterwards but I think it's real brother Ram in paragraph 115 says incredible that is exactly what nanism has come to they say never mind what God's word says you can't understand it all right never mind what God's word says you can't understand it we have to interpret it for you furthermore the Bible is not finished it has to change with the times and we will tell you what the changes are isn't that convenient goodness sakes how contrary that contrary that is to the word of God that emphatically States let God be true but every man a liar Whenever there is a conflict with the truth Heaven and Earth will pass away but not one word of God will fail so the people are led by people who presume to be what they are not and we know that the Ephesian church was able to call them Liars amen they say they are Vicor of Christ but what they are is Antichrist paragraph 116 here is another sad story it is the story of water baptism in Jesus day and after Pentecost they were immersed in water no one can deny that educated men say that all they did was pour water on them because it was easy to find little holes of water in many places and when they pour water on them they do it in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost as if those titles were real names and as if there were three Gods instead of just one but stay in that organization and try and preach the truth of immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be put out you couldn't be led of God and stay in there it's impossible you know for the longest time I know I've said it a couple times but I'll say it now for the longest time I thought maybe this was something in the past I had never really had the conversation with someone who found out what I believe really wanted to know what I believe so I told him what I believe and and he said you know there's three persons in the godhead to me and and I was kind of like what three persons and he said that to me the Father the Son the Holy Ghost yeah the three persons of the godhead and I I thought my goodness it's real and he actually vly refused the name of Jesus Christ water baptism with me I I was like shocked but it's a real thing I can see it L and clear most times it's just under the surface but if you ever get into that conversation you'll see how quickly and the reason for it is it's the Antichrist Spirit he don't want to give an inch because he knows there's power in the name of Jesus Christ that's the only Power there is my paragraph 117 now Paul was a prophet taught by the Holy Ghost if Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and said anyone that did different from his preaching was a curse then it is time to wake up and see that the church is no longer controlled by the Holy Ghost but is controlled by the nicians Acts 20 27-30 for I have not shun to declare unto you the whole the for for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overse ERS to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them just going to leave that alone paragraph 18 1118 Paul saw that coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would impl they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit Ministry my and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the leoty and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it Lord help us this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship am paragraph 119 and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time God gives a visitation of the Holy Spirit and the people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when Luther came out of Catholicism the people stayed free for a while but when he died the people Simply Organized what they thought he believed now I just want to pause there for a second brothers and sisters and I just want to say this I think it's important for us in our day we've got a prophet messenger amen have we actually done the same thing have the people Simply Organized what they thought William Mary and brandham believed that's why I'm so thankful I heard it early on coming to church brother Ken he said write a list of the things you believe take them back to the word of God take them back to the message of the hour and see if they line up and if they don't line up just let them go take them off your list because they're not right and they will actually take us astray amen now I'm not saying that everyone has and I'm not saying that we have here but I do know this we have many people from many different areas of the world many different different pastors and teachers many different ideas and and call it theologies brothers and sisters we got to have Christ as the central theme of our existence don't try and take and think about what brother Bram did and how he would do things take the word that he brought and go live your life the people Simply Organized what they thought he believed and set up their own Creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone who said opposite to what they said so you know I'm thinking as I'm saying this I know I'm getting looks brothers and sisters I'm not crazy you ever seen a legalistic Ministry you ever seen people where you can't even say Amen in a church right that's this this is that yes sir they've organized their ideas and made their Creeds and created away maybe they never wrote it in a book but I guarantee you they have a meeting yes sir and they talk about it and the families go home and implement it with their children right yes sir they went right back to Catholicism with a little different form and right today many Lutheran are ready to go all the way back oh yes in Revelations 12 that old had many daughters these daughters are just like the mother they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of God subjugate the leoty and make it impossible for the leoty to worship God unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief for Satan himself amen now brothers and sisters I I mentioned it a while ago and and and I'll just I think it's good to bring it to top of mine Anthony Palmer if you haven't heard that name for a while think about that name maybe look him up on YouTube Tony Palmer he went and visited The ecumenical council in the United States of America in I don't know what it was 2009 and what he did was he said the protest was over and so whether the people in the denominations and maybe the all of the other churches it doesn't matter what matters is that every one of the church leaders that were in that meeting they all fell under the Catholic church right because the Catholic Church said to them everyone hey you know what Catholic means Universal that's what he told them and if we're all Christians we're all Christlike we're all the same did we ever hear that before oh yeah nobody stood up in that meeting and said I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ nobody said I can't take this I'm out of here you're a liar you're nobody everyone agreed to it everyone sat through it and all those that did took all of the people under their Ministries with them whether they want to understand it or believe it or not it doesn't matter that's the truth of the matter they're all under Rome the protest is over now it's been for a long time that day on Calvary amen paragraph 121 where oh where are we spiritually we are in a Wilderness of Darkness how far we have wandered from the first church Pentecost is nowhere in View and the word cannot be found apostol succession which today abounds is not found in the word it is a manmade device it supersedes illegally the truth that God not man has set his leaders in the church Peter was not even in Rome yet they lie and say he was we were in Rome and we saw the grave of Peter in St Peter's Basilica but here we have the prophet saying he's not even there and I remember looking at that scratch in my head I was pretty early on as a as a Christian maybe three or four years as a Believer but I remember scratching my head saying there's something wrong with this I don't know exactly what it is but I know the prophet said something about this says it right here it supersedes illegally the truth that God man has set his leaders in the church Peter was not even in Rome yet they lie and say he was history proves he was not there are people who read history but shrug their shoulders and go back to believing a lie yeah yeah where can you find the Vicor of Christ in the word no one takes his place and yet it has been done and the people accept it where can you find that added Revelation is accepted by God especially Revelation contrary to one already given yet they accept it and rest on it where do you find a Purgatory where do you find a mass excuse me where do you find paying money to get out of hell it's not in the word but men put it in their own book and by it took over the people ruling them by fear I'll call the musicians as we close here where do you find that man has the power to forgive us as though he were God Grievious wolves is hardly strong enough to describe them nianis organization man over man he says get back to God repent before it's too late see the handwriting on the wall it is writing judgment as the sacred vessels were desecrated and thus brought the wrath of God now the sacred word has been desecrated and the spirit grieved and judgment is here even at the door repent repent go back to the Pentecost back to the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen back to the word of God for why will ye die maybe stand with me as we close I'm just going to stop there get back and repent is the cry get away from nickan ISM I just love the way brother brandham points to the word points to the leadership of the Holy Ghost and brothers and sisters I just I'm more so much more convinced now than ever that is the only way truth and life for us in our day amen we'll pick up here on on page 104 uh the voice of the spirit next next Wednesday Lord willing and uh it's based on Revelations 2:7 God richly bless you tonight let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for your leadership yes Lord and Lord many times in many ways in our lives it seems we let you down father
