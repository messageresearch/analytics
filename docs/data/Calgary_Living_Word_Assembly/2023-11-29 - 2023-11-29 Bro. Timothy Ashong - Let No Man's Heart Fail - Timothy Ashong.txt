inspired again I got to walk and God laid a song on my heart and um something told me we send a message to propul I was like oh I'll do it later sure enough that day was really really stressful at walk and at the end of the day I didn't feel a bit like singing um and I was thinking maybe someone needed to hear that song maybe someone needed the message in that song um last week I had another song laid on my heart and again earlier in the week I wasn't feeling like and but this morning I woke up and I was like Satan not today around 6:00 before 700 I sent a message to prop Paul let's get that done I'll sing Tonight by God's grace and um um this song um it's title God is good one thing constant is that God is good and uh my prayer is that our struggles whatever God allows us to go

surrender this is not for me it's for someone here I don't know who you are but I pray this will be a blessing for you Christ's mind if the mind of Christ is in us oh what a wondrous sight in his presence our minds are renewed filled with Holy Light No Longer Bound by Earthly thoughts but transformed from within re recognize his word as truth as it lives right through us undimmed the life in any Vine a watermelon transferred to another a pumpkin vine it Bears the original life without question for the life within it aligns so too if the mind of Christ dwells within your being we cannot help but bear the fruits of his truth seeing but if doubt Creeps in if we question the word's divine power then that is a sign that another Spirit May surely Devour the spirit of Life Christ fills us with faith and belief empowering us to seize his word activating sweet relief we are no longer confined by the limitations of this flesh in Christ we soar like eagles our Spirits miraculously refreshed his mind displaces ours protecting every thought enlightening our understanding with wisdom not bought oh to have the mind of Christ what a gift Divine to see through his eyes to understand his design in his presence there's no room for doubt or fear only an UND enduring trust as his voice we hear let us surrender our minds to the Lord's control allowing his word to saturate making us whole with the mind of Christ we are transformed we're set free living vessels of his love and truth for all to see in the mind of Christ there's no room for deception only a steadfast connection to perfect perception let us receive his word fully letting it dwell limitlessly within truly knowing that through Christ we are victorious we always win God bless you [Music] all now why don't we give

book of Samuel chapter 17 first samel chapter 17 samel chapter 17 let us read from verse 31 and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before saw and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with these Philistines and so said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight against him for thou B A Youth and he a man of war from his Youth and they said to so thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamp out of the flock and I went out after him and smoked him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and Smo him and slew him that servant slew both the Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them amen seeing you have defy the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the power of the lion and out of the power of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and sa said unto David go and the Lord be with thee amen may God bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated praise the Lord I say praise the Lord yes I didn't say praise Timothy I said praise the Lord hallelujah h is worthy to be praised he's worthy to be worshiped Hallelujah so we love him and we love his people and we are happy to be back in the house of the Lord amen that's been a while since I think 2019 I was said the last time but well we thank God that we are still pressing on and uh the one that began that good work in us will bring it completion because God is faithful and so this evening I want us to encourage ourselves from the scripture that we have read 32 when David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him so this evening let no man's heart fail because of whatever you might be going through because of whatever challenge because of because whatever golad because of whatever mountain is before you let no man's heart fail for we are serving the Living God and he is faithful well we did not bring ourselves here he brought us here amen and uh he's prepared to take us through am before he brought us here he already already had his own plans amen so I love it when brother said that until God has finished with us no one can take us away no matter what I strongly believe in that last year by this time I was very sick I was in the US I came in around uh July and and uh I stayed for 9 months in the US and I was sick very sick I had a surgery prostate surgery on um 14th of November so last year by this time I was sick I could not do anything but thank God that today I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me Hallelujah I came in and uh I was uh you know back home before coming I think from May somewhere begin to have problem urin and difficulties and challenges and and uh and I was so much in pains I've been to the hospitals have been them and day and night I could not even sleep because they said my prostrate has become too big and uh and there was element of cancer part of it when I went to the doctor and the doctor told me about that you don't have to worry I said no no no I don't fear because when it said cancer the only thought that came to me was the message do you fear cancer so I was not afraid because I I strongly believe that the Lord has a purpose for my life for every one of us amen and I have to work CET for 9 months nine good months I flew in to the US I was wearing it and I was going to the hospital in and out they would take it out I said take it out they will take it out I will come back home I will not be able to pee I have to go back oh it was bad man but thank God I'm standing today praise the Lord so let no man's heart fa until God has finished with man nothing can take you from it nothing I was sick after the surgery they asked me to come in to do cystogram they want to see 10 days after the so they wanted to see if the stitches and whatever was healed before they can take the catheter I went they did it they said no there's a part that is not so go and come back another 10 days so I went back another 10 days or two weeks I went 10 there when they I got on the table for the cogr to be done I begin to shake the whole table was shaking the doctor what is that I I don't know was so they have to call my wife who brought Timothy Aon and then she came and she was just standing there and he said all the system everything was shutting down kidneys everything was faing they tried to give drap and said nothing I was not able to PE I was and it was just there and she said she was just praying and somehow Grace came down again am amen and what I thank God for that day is even when we left to the hospital I was fine at this time the family that we were staying with my brother my sister and a son they've traveled to Africa so we just the two of us myself and my wife were home and I said Satan you lost you miss it again because if the challenge I had was H happened in the house it would have been very difficult because my wife would not know what to do and the brother that we can call upon is 45 minutes drive away so God made it that right before the doctors this thing happened there so you can trust God he's always there and he's there on time so let no man's heart amen hallelujah no no and God has finished say nothing can take us away and then uh they did it so once it happened before the doctor quickly they mve me to the emergency world I stayed there for 6 days when the surgery was done I was disted the next day and this time I have to stay for 6 days in the emergency and they said it it was eoli they said blood infection when they did a surgery they took the the prostrate out and then the lymph noes they took it out and then after a while I was having difficulties in Walking I could to LIF my leg was it was very difficult I could not walk so the brothers provided for me H this zma friend the worker to be working with when God has not finished with you nothing can take you away so let not your heart fail praise the Lord I could not Le my to this place or that place when I'm sitting in the car they have to hold me to sit in and lift my leg and put it there and leave this one in pains and at that point even when i s sit down I cannot get up they have to PST pull me out when I lie down I cannot tend this way I cannot tend that way but today by his grace amen I am what I am am so let no man's heart fail the Lord who brought us here as a purpose for our lives praise the Lord I could not do anything in fact when they even took the CER from me I have to wear Pampers because the doctor said you've we this h c for 9 months so the system has gotten used to the just dripping and oh the Pampers should be so wow yeah but one thing about me I don't pity myself no no no because I know God has a purpose for my life amen it's not a comfortable situation and you might be in a situation that is not comfortable but brother BR says sometimes a witness must suffer a little to be a witness am you must suffer a little sir all the people that we read about in the scriptures if you put yourself in their shoes you talk about Job the suffering you talk about the different ones the what they went through if they had not gone through that what will you be reading and he said those things were written for our learning yes so whatever you might be going through today don't pity yourself am the prophet of God said if you have a trial you find favor with God he said if you have a trial that shows God has confidence in you as he had confidence in job and he said God knows you will stand the test somebody say praise the Lord prise hallelujah I wear Pampers you know and before I left Ghana to go to come to the states and I was met I met a doctor in one of our big hospitals and the doctor was telling me you know they can do it there they can do it that's okay but uh you know people travel overseas and they do it for them and they will come and the rest of their lives they will be wearing Pampers but today by God's grace I don't wear Pampers amen yes I was I was I was SM in pains when I could not work I have to even we have to see a physiotherapist but said no we have to call I have to call Brother Toby father he's a physiotherapist so I call him from Nigeria he okay take a picture of your walking and everything video we send it to him he will send back the video okay do it this way I said I cannot even tell myself said no you try do this do this praise the Lord so God saw me through that also amen I said I stand here today is by the grace of the Lord hallelujah amen and just know that when God has not finished with a man nothing can take him from this place amen when I have to sit in the car they almost some one time they almost pull me tried to carry me to put into the car I could not let my no no I could not do it when I lie down I could not get up but by God's grace today it is a thing of the past and uh in that I just keep remembering the scriptures and it came to pass so I said to myself this also shall pass so whatever it be sorry it will pass so let no man's heart fa we are sorry we are not in picnic we are in a battle it's a fight the prophet of God said Christianity is not a picnic it is a battle between right and wrong between the word of God and denominationalism or theologies contrary to the word of God but the Lord has brought us here for sorry for a purpose and he will see us through amen sorry it will be fine amen so the Bible tells us we are not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against spiritual wickedness in high places so we admonished we are admonished to put on the all armor of God Amen so remember it's not a picnic it is a fight yes sir and we have to fight amen if we fight we win because Christ Jesus has already won the battle for us and there David came to the children of Israel at this time it was a crisis time and I want to remind ourselves that the story of Israel has been always battle from the days of Abraham you remember how Abraham gathered the men of his own household when lot was captured Abraham went against five Kings and he defeated them so be assure Israel will defeat every enemy as long as they are in the promised land praise the name of the Lord and uh when this Invasion took place over the 7th of October for Sunday morning when I heard it I was so sad because I was going to preach and I was almost crying how did it happen because the whole world knows about the security of Israel how they are so mindful about that but what happened I thought of many things and I said well the Lord might have allowed this to happen for a purpose but then I was thinking again and I said wow what caused it Israel was divided at that time they were almost fighting one another and in their unguided moment the enemy came in the enemy just took advantage because they were fighting accusing one another this one say this this one say that this one say this this why say that so the enemy came in and it caused them so much never has it ever happened that since they became a nation 75 years ago that so many Israelites will be killed in their own land right some of them kidnap I mean it's too much but they were fighting among themselves we should not be fighting among ourselves let me just read this little thing the prophet says I've never talked to I've never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the Nations it is becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got shooting at one another he's got an open Target and anywhere he wants to shoot and what is the use of shooting we are shooting at one another see so he can just set back and and relax when we begin to shoot at one another Satan will get back and relax sit back said then we are doing the work of the devil the prophet said let me just give you he said if I have found favor Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and to get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has Absolut absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong is not you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God don't mention that he has done you wrong I mean he has done you wrong don't mention that did we say Amen to that he's talking to us don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your brother stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father where a prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father Yes is my brother and he justly he deserves punishment because he has done this and that to me this evil to me and I don't know why I don't see why he did it listen to this portion then let God go to talking to you it means so much me let God go to talking to you not to the fellow not to the one that has wrong you but let God go to talking to you that have been wrong and you will see maybe what that man has been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and cause him to do that though he is absolutely wrong listen to that before you leave the Throne of God you will be feeling sorry for that man though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you will be feeling sorry for that man are we following that amen these are instructions given to us by the prophet of God if you want to be blessed if you want to be a blessing then let's follow these instructions amen the prophet said you will be sympathizing with that brother you'll be sympathizing with the one that has wrong you and when you get back down to where to Earth again that's after prayer you will go over to the brother and shake his hand that's the prophet speaking you will go over to the one that has wrong you that you are waiting for him to come and apologize yes or you are praying to God God let my brother or my wife or this one see what he has said and come and apologize to to me I heard people pray that kind of prayer God have mercy the prophet of God said you will go you will have you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing for that man with that man and you will go to him and shake his hands we believe the prophet amen amen these things are not just spoken of given to us for knowledge these things should be made fresh in us the word should be Quicken the word should be made flesh until it is made flesh in you and I will not get anywhere you'll be sympathizing with the brother and when you get back down to Earth again you will go over to the brother and shake his hand cuz you know what what is been through you know what is been through to offend you you know what is been through to hurt you you'll be sympathizing with him you will go to him and shake his hands brother sister it's over let's go let's forget about this and let's go amen the prophet said you cannot stand with a MTAR in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner that's right and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accus wrong when he is not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he is mortal and maybe listen his destination rest upon our attitude toward him amen maybe his destination rest on our attitude toward him when we came back from the Throne of God will realize that we are everyone guilty and we all need help one from another and the best way to do is prayer amen dear ones sometimes you know we conceive ideas about each other and you know that when you conceive something you will Beth it when you conceive you will deliver what you conceive is what you bring forth amen and sometime we conceive ideas so once we conceive our eyes will see the same thing yes sir every every action you you will see it according to your conception that's right amen and watch out if something comes to you from God God will never make you to be bitter amen against one another no God will never do it if God is dealing with you if God reveals something to you if God ministers onto a man you will never be bitter no matter what is done against you we sing the song Fe my way every day with love what does the scripture tells us Jesus said love your neighbor and love your enemy and love one another right he say so so as I've said to many people in many places all my wife is like this or your your husband is like this or this brother is like that or that sister is like this listen if you cannot love her or him as a brother love that fellow as your neighbor amen if you cannot love that fellow as your neighbor love that fellow as your enemy because Jesus said love your enemies you say your wife you can't love her as a wife love her as your neighbor or your husband love him as neighbor if you cannot love him as your neighbor love him as your enemy because he said love your enemies so we have no we have no way out I'm telling you that's why brother ABR told us love is the strongest weapon when it is put to test it will defeat the strongest [Music] enemy Brothers the only way we can serve God in spirit and in truth in sincerity is to lose our minds Hallelujah and the Bible say let this mind which was in Christ be in you you cannot serve god with your own mind I think and I feel no no you can't make it you have to lose your mind am beloved why are we in this condition is because we are too much alive to ourselves if all that we have been hearing if you and I we have been applying this things in our lives we'll be out of here by now amen dear ones time is not on our side the Lord is coming we can see with what is happening in the word today that we don't have to ding ding we don't have to play church we have to be up and be doing amen because time is not look at what is happening in Israel what Israel that is God's timetable Israel natural is a type of the Israel spiritual right and so remember this that our enemies are always looking for an opportunity to strike us your enemy the Bible say our enemy the devil our adversary the devil as a rolling lion walking about seeking who he made devile so we are not in picnic we are in a battle so we have to put on the o Armor of God so that we'll be able to stand in this hour brother Bram said to miss church service is better to miss work a day's work that's right I know you would not say Amen today amen may God have preeminence in our lives praise the Lord Jesus told us if you put your hand on the prow and look back you are not fit for the kingdom we had to fight as soldiers of the Cross and if we fight we'll win because God is on our side amen and I've always said to people it is not good for us to be comparing ourselves with one another amen it's not good it's not right because we are made differently for different purposes as we are here we are not all the same we have tall slim whatever whatever you want to call it different shape of heads you can see my own head it's different from yours and the prophet of God said listen don't try to be somebody else because we are made k seriously we are made differently to serve different purposes even in the house of God oh you say nobody knows me that's the devil's deceiving you God knows you nobody sees what I'm doing don't forget about forget about that whether anybody see you or nobody sees you do what God want you to do where nobody agrees with you fine so what if nobody agrees so what amen God if they don't agree with you sit down do what you have to do you need to have a revelation of the purpose of God for your life and when you know that God want you to stand here then stand there no matter what the opposition might be amen if you know who you are and you know your position and your place in Christ stand there and God will take you through amen praise the name of the Lord let no man's heart fail David came under the sin in this great hour of need when the children of Israel it say they were in the corner they didn't know what to do but I'm glad that when we don't know what to do he knows what to do am he is the way the truth in the life and it makes way where there is no way and I want you to know this that God still making way for his people he's still making way and he will make a way for you so let not your heart fail don't look at yourself say oh ask for me nobody cares no who told you that don't let the devil prain a picture to you that you are the one that is suffering more than anybody in this world that's a lie don't forget he's a liar from the beginning and he's still telling lies so don't believe it's lie that tells you you nobody like you and nobody cares for you and nobody is interested in you that's a lie when he bring you to that condition then you have pity for yourself and self-pity is sin and then you want to separate yourself from your brothers because the devil has painted a picture to you that your brothers and your sisters they don't like you so that when people even greet you wonder whether it's from their heart yeah I was talking said brother if you you say sorry is it from your heart I said how do you know what is in the heart of a person amen what is from my heart or it's from my head I say sorry yours is to receive it if that fellow is not sincere God will hold him are we together let us obey the word because this is the purpose of the word that has been given to us we've have the doctrines and Revelations and this one and that one and that one brother Bram said if any good thing will come to us it has to be revealed by the spirit of God Amen it has to be confirmed by the word of God sorry amen and it has to be made manifest by the fruits by the results amen so look at the results that com from your life then you will know whether God is in control or whoever is in control amen amen praise the Lord am how can you be a believer and your heart is fill with bitterness and Malice unforgiveness always this one did something to me always this one did something to me talk about something that somebody has done against you 20 years ago 30 years ago you can still remember it and you have been praying every day right wow may God help us Breen listen our coming and going should not be in vain the word has been delivered to us what are we doing with what has been delivered to us we tend to forget easily when God has done things for us because if Israel did not forget they would not have been afraid of golad because what didn't God do for them living Egypt through the supernatural the mighty work of Jehovah think about it they look Beyond and they didn't see what God even has done in their personal lives for you to wear one dress for 40 years and it didn't grow old you don't have to go far to see Miracle wearing one clothes for 40 years walking for 40 years and the shoes they wear there was no problem with it there was no cracks at the back of their feet and they forget that and many at times we forget it we are looking around here and there and you know it's so pitiful that sometime we looking at the one ahead of us oh I want to be like look at that brother look at this and that and that and all that God is doing around you you don't see nothing because you are looking at somebody else and the Beautiful part is that somebody also is looking at you some somebody wish ah I wish I'm like this brother here I wish I'm like this sister look at a husband look at a wife look at it and you also are looking at somebody else so when we should be giving thanks to God oh no we see God has failed us God has disappoint why did God disappoint you is because we become greedy and Covetous yes yes that's right cover not your neighbor's wife cover not your neighbor's husband cover not your neighbor's Farm cover not your neighbor's anything is that not the word of the Lord amen hallelujah amen may the Lord Jesus help us take God at his word if they have G remember the word what God did for them but they forgot it because they were looking around and they want to be like other people listen I've said it listening it's not good for us to be comparing ourselves with one another because we are made differently for different purpos amen and I said Peter was in jail one day he was in prison and the Believers prayed and the angel of the Lord came in Midnight why he came in Midnight that is his own choice he did not come midnight because he was afraid of soldiers are you understanding that he was not afraid of the soldiers but he choose to come that hour because the people were praying at that time and to let us know that God answers prayer he came me at midnight and I want to say to you that when the age of the the Lord came to the prison he was not working like this so that nobody will hear no he was in charge of everything and I want you to know he's in charge of everything today I want you to remember that Peter was sleeping between two people two soldiers in Chains but the chain fell off and it came out amen and I pray that your chains also will fall out so that you will come out from where you are buried from whatever situation you are in from whatever habit you are in whatever has changed you may God make your change to fall so that you rise up God is able whether you are in drugs whether you are whatever it might be fight whatever the Lord is able to deliver and to set you free it says to the uttermost God is God today as he was then the CH fell amen he said come on get out follow me and this door open and that door open as he follows the angel of the Lord keep following the angel of the Lord and He will open the doors before [Applause] you let no man's heart fail the God who started the work in us will not leave it halfway amen for whatever God start to do in complete it amen I didn't bring the Mery you didn't bring the Mery God brought it to us it is not William Bram it is God that William Bram to bring the message to us and God has made us to be recipient of the message the god that has make us to believe because not everybody has seen the light God open our eyes to see the light and whatever is left to be done God will see to it that is done brother Bram said God will fulfill his word to the letter no matter what God will do it so let no man's heart fail huah Hallelujah the angel went Before Peter and the doors were open one door after the other one everything open the angel didn't do nothing he didn't touch it come on open it's God today and he still remain God we just have to follow him follow his instruction and follow his order now we move from there Paul and Silas were thrown into jail the Bible said when they were thrown into jail they begin to sink right they choose to sing and clap their hands right they have been beaten mercilessly and bleeding all over they could have sat down there and be crying and be accusing one another just like something happened to us we find somebody to accuse it's because of this is because of that but Paul and Salas they were praising God Amen they were singing they were clapping not in church in prison and you come to church you can't do that you should be ashamed of yourself amen amen you want to be back before you sing you want to be back before you clap your hands you should be ashamed with all that God has done for you before all that he's doing for us you want to be back you to come to church as if somebody should beg I don't see it that way amen no way Hallelujah you are sitting here and you are complaining go out of America and see condition that people are in and they are singing and smiling and worshiping God what will your excuse on that day stop misbehaving hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah don't just be looking at me let me be free I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm at home Hallelujah so if the Lord put something on my heart to say let me be saying it you understand it and receive it receive it and straighten your lives because that is the purpose why we come to church amen Satan is losing and he has lost because he didn't even want to leave me but I'm here to anyhow and I believe you are hearing me praise be to God so let us go forward hallelujah praise the name of the Lord the door open when they were sinking the Bible said other prisoners had them singing you are singing as if you afraid you don't want anybody to hear you singing and praising God when the Bible says shout unto the Lord with the voice of Triumph shout unto the king of glory oh clap your hands all you people shout onto god with a voice of Triumph for the Lord God om poent is a great king over all the Earth shout hallelujah and bless the name of the king amen hallelujah Bren God has been too good to us he has been so good to us he deserve our worship you know what there is one thing God cannot do for himself he cannot worship himself sir he worship by his subjects we are his subjects amen we are the one that worship him let's worship god let's be grateful to God think about it God opening our eyes to see the light of our day amen think about it God spent our life to see today we are not better than people that have died yeah but God give us opportunity to come back to house to come back to shout and praise God imagine you lost your voice and you cannot sleep you give prayer requests yeah Brothers pray for me I lost my voice when they give you voice to praise him are you praising him Hallelujah the voice that he gave you what are you doing with it so that you can go to say Lord I was praising I was singing I was shouting I was pressing you what will you go and tell God when Ezekiel was told he was going to that to set his house in order he went back to go said remember walk before you I've done this I've done this give me more time I'll do more what are you going to tell God Amen don't get quiet on me amen I am provoking you onto good works unto love amen praise the name of the Lord we should serve god listen and let Satan be ashamed of himself serve God let the devil be ashamed that yes we are the redeem of the lord we are the chosen of the Lord serve God but we should not serve God as you are being Force you have been forced to pray you have been forced to read Bible you have been forced to listen to message why what do you want God to do for you you listen we I'm not here to Baby anybody Hallelujah if at the age my sister is or any of even this little ones here the one m one Su breast they say hey are you sick yeah God will not be babying us he want us to be man he want us to be up and be doing you must know who you are you must know that we are in a battle hallelujah it's a fight it's a battle look at Israel today fighting and Israel said Israel will win I love you know when I hear that confession it made me feel good and they have been wring the Bible you know what and they have more united than ever whatever he said no it is about Israel so today they are so United you can't get even to speak against the Prime Minister all the opposition people they all together because it is the state of Israel may God knit our hearts together may God unite our hearts together so that we will fear the lord and pray for one another Hallelujah are we together let no man's heart fail because of golad you might have a go before you but don't let your heart fail our God is able amen as they begin to sing praises of God there was earthquake the whole place was shaken and the doors open the Bible said Paul and Silas they were still there they didn't go out whatever if said oh the other day we let Peter and Peter went out let's go no they stay there those that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God don't compare your life to anybody you must be led by the spirit of God to do what you have to do Hallelujah they stayed there until it was morning and then the officer looked and the doors were open and they took knife said no don't do any evil to yourself we are here because the Bible say he thought the prisoners have run out and I know he might have seen a lot of day breaks and he knows the consequence so he wanted to kill himself but said no we are here that brought salvation to the man and his family why did Paul andas went to prison for that family that's why he went to prison if they have run out that man maybe they were about to die nobody I don't know what happened after that but because they stay that man and his family was saved and today we have that quote that we can go believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and th household shall be save if they've run out what will you have gotten this SC it's not wise to compare yourself to anybody amen know that you are different and you have been called for a purpose and you must have the revelation of what you have been called for and stand and do it God plac you in the church he plac you there for a purpose amen yeah know I want to go to a bigger church I want to go to this and that I see people move out to different places and that is the end of their lives even to go to a place accommodation whatever pray to God God guide me where do you want me to be God told Abraham I will show you where to go amen lot when the angel brought him out of Sodom the angel show him where to say I want to stay here you know the story of lot the angel was showing where to go and he said no that place said there are no people there that place is like this let me stay there that was his end Abraham was called not knowing where he was going but he followed the Lord and when you follow the lord he always lead you right amen so saints of God we should be men and women of prayer we should ask for God's grace in our lives blessed be the name of the Lord let no man's heart fail Hallelujah don't worry my voice is broken but I think you are getting something amen yeah it's okay let him do what he can do I don't care about that amen am glory to God am amen we are in a battle amen and know that you are in a battle we have an enemy listen we are fighting an enemy very cruel I

face the enemy Hallelujah can't Joy or Joy when you fall into divers trials let no man's heart fail he will not leave us alone he will not forsake us maybe you don't know what to do this hour but I want to say to you God has prepared a divid and is [Music] coming Jesus is our David when mankind was lost hopeless and corned he came down Hallelujah so you might be in a situation and you might not know what to do but somebody is watching over you am God saw Israel at that condition in that situation and David all along was being prepared at the back side of the desert Hallelujah I'm so glad and I said if the father of David Jesse had knew that David was going to fight golad he would never have SE David he will never you not crazy who will send his son even the king was afraid so God hide things for himself oh Hallelujah and it makes it play when it has to be play don't worry let not your have don't try to know so much here and there keep walking in the light brother Bram said Children of the light keep working in the light watch and see more unfold unto you so it will unfold as you get closer Hallelujah let no man's heart F in that condition in that hour David was simp by his father go and see how your brothers are doing and give some food to them and give to their Captain I said the father of David was a wise man I said because when he give food to David he said give to their Captain their Commander too when you are living with people or you have a police guiding you somebody's you should be wise to take care of the one that is guiding you because if you don't take care he will sell you out amen if you have a maid you stay with a maid and then taking care of your children and you don't give them made food he will eat the children food and it will abuse you am amen yeah I'm telling you the truth yeah may God help us you don't pay you don't abuse you don't care oh okay he will settle himself yeah he will satisfy himself may God help us David's father said give this to your brothers and give them to their off officer good and God made it a way that when David got there goad came again give me a man and the soers run away and David said what is that what are they running for his some brothers came against him you're a noty you are too know you are holier than he said hey is there not a cause Hallelujah don't let anybody intimidate you don't let anybody push you from your grounds stand where God has placed you no matter who disagrees with you when God called you when you meet God at the back side of the desert and he speaks to your heart nothing no opposition can make you to fall no opposition can make you to run remember there will be opposition but you make it because you met him at the back side of the desert Hallelujah am let no my S and David look at it he said is there not a cause and I like what David did the the Bible say walk away from those unbelievers his brother walk away from them you don't have to waste your time on unbelievers you don't have to waste your time on people that will tell you the message is wrong brother made mistake and this I don't have time for that you you never made mistake before you you never made mistake before brother BR said do you think God will give me the ministry he has given me in vindicate it all over the world and leave me in error he said certainly not he said I know where I'm standing when Jus spoke and he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me to them it was wrong statement because Moses said don't eat blood and Jesus said eat my flesh what is he talking about but that was a true statement he made forget Hallelujah if you don't believe just go we we believe or let me rather say it I I believe you can say it for yourself me I believe I'm a m believer let no man have Fai Deliverance is on the way coming am Deliverance is on the way coming for you salvation is coming healing is coming because the price has already been paid for you so let not your heart fade there is a time and a season for every scripture to be fulfilled it cannot be too early it cannot be too late it's always on time amen so David could not have come earlier than when he came he could not have come 40 days 40 no of judgment and God made him to hear that say oh wow he said I'll fight when he met golad he said this one I'll take it up he was prepared and when he came and saw tried to you know you cannot because this man is a man of war from his youth oh a man of war from his what about David he's another youth if somebody can be a man of war from his youth somebody also can be a man of war from his youth that's right right what are you talking about amen but you see fear blinded them they were just looking at golad he get 14 fingers look at his fingers six fingers here 14 Ines Long hey look at his head hey look at his fear this is what they were looking at sir and the more they were looking at that the more they were destroying their faith their faith was shed because they were looking at golad amen his sword his spear his head his look at his br oh from his youth many years he has you need men and women that has made God at the backs side of the desert men of experience men and women that have met God and when David saw golad no he was just looking at the promise of God he look at him he said no I'll kill this man because God God delivered me from the power of the lion from the power of the said this one will be number three he said the same God that did this he will do it again David's Bast was in the Lord amen don't rely upon yourself on your strength your knowledge let us ask the grace of God Upon Our Lives is said that same God will do it for me if the others have remembered any promise of God but they didn't remember nothing that's right they forgot all but when David came and begin to quote the scriptures the word of the Lord and made his boast upon Jehovah god Jehovah strengthen him Jehovah give him courage and strength amen and the s s said yeah you cannot this I can do it if you cannot do something don't think because you cannot do it so nobody can do it amen don't forget about that if you cannot do so all of us cannot do it I st stand back stand stand stand aside yes remember this even in death we are not defeated Hallelujah a real soldier of Christ will want to die in the work a real army is army they want to die in fight in war die to be captured than to surrender we don't surrender we don't retreat we fight on Keep On Believing amen amen L thing brother BR said faith is not always oh he took me out of this Faith endures Faith endures amen let no man's heart faith faithful is he that has called us and he will do it yes David went forward and he told golad you come to me with Spears and this and that but I come to you in the name of the god of Israel whose may you have Def and I will kill you he will deliver you to me I will kill you he didn't have nothing but God provided for him he provides when the need Rises am so let not your heart fail he knows what to do some gu he use a stick us God and he kill 600 Philistines s j 1,000 let no man's heart fa in the Supreme hour the Supreme hour provide Supreme faith and the Supreme work will be done may God be with us and God bless you let not your heart fade no matter what the doctor says no matter what anybody says Faithful Is He that has call us and he will do it for you God bless [Music] you sorry forgive me for my voice next time I hope it will be better you almost have to say is it done already you know I believe that even in an army as we heard about tonight armies have generals and I believe in God's Army we just heard from a general we heard from a battle scarred veteran someone that knows God is real I believe we were we were spoken to tonight I know the Lord spoke to me directly and if nobody else got anything I can certainly say this was for me tonight what a tremendous service what a tremendous disservice we do if we come here and we don't worship we know that Jesus said the Rocks would cry out immediately if the people won't and you know we've said it in the past I think it's so good everybody probably knows it but I'm just going to going to say it we didn't talk about a thing I didn't talk to brother Timothy until he was in the office at the back and we never spoke about anything this is the Lord that spoke tonight if if you felt something twinge in your heart from what was said that was God dealing with you directly and it's just so important to recognize brothers and sisters we're coming to the place where we're not going to be talking about quotes and tapes and books and and and even coming to church the only thing we're going to have is worship and our desire to worship God and and and if we don't have that desire then maybe we ought to try and find that desire because that's what it's all about is worshiping God and uh anyways what a tremendous what a tremendous time tonight let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you are gracious amen Lord Jesus even when we trip and and stumble and fall even when we get tricked by the enemy eny even when we lord many times sin against you father you're still so kind and loving and you you come around and you encourage Us by Your Word father you'll send a brother from a different continent around the world to come and and encourage us Lord to shake us up Lord to dust us off to to pick us up and give us a helping hand to recognize that your incomplete control there's no reason for our hearts to fail us the only reason is because we do it to ourselves and father we just ask tonight that Lord you would restore brother Timothy's strength father we're so thankful for the testimony in his life Lord how you touched his body and how his heart never failed what a tremendous testimony Lord I pray tonight if anyone's heart here tonight has been failing Lord that you would just restore strength in the name of Jesus Christ that we would leave this building new creatures father recharged by the encouragement of your word tonight and Lord If It Be Your Will for us to gather again on on Sunday Lord we'll be careful to do it and and do it with joy in our hearts Lord hallelujah father we thank you that you would just say to us if we're busy fighting against one another then we're given the devil a time off oh father so many points tonight thank you for ministering to us Lord thank you for answering our prayer for allowing brother Timothy to get out of the way Lord and for giving us Hearts to receive it you are so wonderful father what a mighty God we serve Lord we just love you and we thank you we commit each life into your hands now as we go our
